18 locations with 13 stages x4 seasons + different weather conditions gives plenty of roads to drive through.
Many different cars to drive, at over 100h I still didn't drive even all the categories.
Very good handling system, as far as fun goes its up there with acc and I don't think it get's better than that.

Looks great to me especially considering it simulates all 4 seasons + weather. Especially since it works like you expect it to: fallen leaves or snow affect grip, racing line is clean and makes sense and so on. This game has most beautiful clouds I've seen in a video game.

Sound design is unmatched by any racing game ever.

Still has weird performance issues, probably will never be fully addressed. Took a lot of fiddling with settings to get it to work properly.
UI is a terrible console port, sliders are unusable with a mouse.
Has some kinks from unreal engine like automatic exposure not working properly. (the game is overexposed if the sun is shining) which I had to overcome by editing game files.

As far as I've seen this game isn't too glitchy. Sometimes you do glitch through the floor off the track a little bit which does cause extra damage to the car, but it only really happens more often on certain tracks, its not really that bad of an issue, at least not bad enough to not play it at all. 

Only thing I can say is this game is pretty lack luster of modes. There is a situations mode, where you can play a 'famous' rally moment, and there is a career mode, some kind of championship mode that is similar to career, and some other mode that doesn't involve racing I never played. Its low key underwhelming. As far as I know, there is no way to create your own tracks. I could be very wrong, but if there is some kind of sandbox mode, its un-intuitive to find.

But of course, I know Dirt 2, I still play it several times a week, and I have to compare the two, no matter how hard I try to avoid it.


Pros:
* A lot of rally locations and great tracks! This is a very big plus. I desperately needed some fresh rally tracks.
* Nice selection of cars.
* Difficulty settings for everything, informative UI and menus.

Neutral:
* The driving model is a lot easier and more forgiving that in Dirt 2, while still not feeling to [i]arcady[/i]. I can actually talk to a friend who's in the same room while driving! And I have not managed to get a single puncture yet (can you even get one?). In Dirt 2 I crash hard when I do not concentrate on the game 100 per cent. I personally prefer Dirt 2, but I think a lot of people will like this better, and I can definitely live with it. It's a nice complement to more serious racing games after a long day at work.
* I am not at all interested in the customization options (car builder, dressing up your driver), but I can just ignore them.
* I will not comment on the [i]regularity rally[/i] idea.
* The stuttering is rather okay after the patch. On my system I rarely get it, and typically it appears only very briefly and when it's too late anyways, e.g., while I am rolling down a hill next to the road. ;) It has very little influence on my driving now. Still it kills immersion and I am worried for it to return every time it happens. At launch it was very bad, and that stuck with me I guess.
* I don't like the managing you have to do in the career, but that's minor: you can create custom championships.

Negatives:
* The graphics are very, very ugly on some stages. Of course I read the reviews that mentioned it, but on youtube it looked fine, and I thought people were exaggerating. But on youtube everything looks fine due to the blur. The cars and the landscape polygon models are actually absolute fine, but the foliage, especially the trees on some stages, and the lighting, are surprisingly ugly. The hills filled with countless copies of the same ugly sprite tree shocked me. Yes, I have to admit I was shocked on the first stage I tried. Some others are better (Sweden and Iberia seem best, there is little foliage visible due to the snow  or the dry landscape respectively), but  many are really, really ugly. Kenia and Monaco are terrible. This is not what I expected, it's [i]so[/i] much worse than older games!
* [strike]It crashes all the time! I literally cannot finish some of the moments, the Monte Carlo 1980s moment just crashed the third time for me, and I am not going to retry it a forth time. (Yes, I have the latest nvidia driver.)[/strike] UPDATE: It seems it needs lots of video memory on higher settings. I monitored video RAM while playing and it fills up to 8 GB of my card, then crashes. So turn graphics settings down that require much video memory if you experience crashes (texture quality, etc).
* No VR support
* The stuff locked behind the EA subscription, even though you bought the game, is nothing you absolutely need, true. But still I see this as a first step, as getting people used to it. This time it's irrelevant stuff, but this will change over time. And I do not like the general idea at all.
* The initial stage in which it was launched was an impertinence, and this should not be supported. That they broke the career with the first patch was just unprofessional.

Final verdict: to me this is a typical WRC game, like the ones before it: it ain't terrible (now that at least some of the technical issues have been fixed), but it still has some technical issues and simply is not very good. The new locations are the only real plus. I would give this a score in the range of 72 to 76 out of 100. I would maybe recommend this game to people who are interested in rally and who need something new on a sale, even though I like Dirt 2 a lot better. In general, I would say skip it. You could also wait some more time and pick it up for really cheap soon if you're on the fence. Definitely don't pay full price.

I bought this for 30€ during the Christmas sale despite the bad comments here on Steam (which I didn't fully believe after reading the positive reviews from gaming magazines) because I am not a hater and I wanted to give it a chance and support Codemasters, so that they can make even more content, fix the issues over time, and make a better game in the future. Back then I did not have time to test it much, and now I cannot refund it anymore. Do I regret it? Hmmm, originally I did. Now, with the crashes gone, I guess I'm more or less fine. But that price was borderline for all the technical issues and the EA subscription move. [h2]7/10[/h2]",1706110818,1708937129,False,0,0,0.557877480983734131,6,True,False,False

While the game could be awesome, there is a sound design choice which makes it nearly unplayable for me. 
The co-driver calls are so quiet, I had to set all other audio settings to minimum, and I can barely hear them over the engine sound. Also the calls' sound quality is so bad, that after a couple of stages, it turns into a static background noise for me, blending in with the engine and I can't hear them at all, I have to read the pacenote cards on top of the screen, which makes me miss a lot of them, and I end up going straight without braking when a turn is hidden because that info is not on the cards. 
I was hoping I just need to get used to it, and I will be able to hear them better, but the opposite happened. 
After 16 hours, I stopped hearing the calls on the first stage of playing, so I am not touching this game until the devs give us a co-driver who is loud and clear, so I don't have to read the pacenotes myself.

Update on 26. feb. 2024:
Took them a few months, but in the 1.5 update they finally made changes to the sounds.

But the game feels very strange outside of the road. The career mode is very clunky and offputting. The car builder is not remotely as deep as you'd like--more like a nod to an idea than the full execution.

The co-driver calls for me a huge problem. Versus Phil Mill's recording in DR2.0, these by comparison sound procedurally generated, flatly delivered, and are therefore hard to decipher. They can also trigger poorly-- seeming to sometimes stutter if you fly through a turn fast enough. The pacing on the call notes on every setting feels bizarre as well. Set it to Earliest, and you'll get a such a mouthful of info that you might be purely overwhelmed. Set to somewhere in the middle, and you'll find yourself going 100 mph right into a hairpin that was called only 2 seconds ago. 

As I said too, the delivery is entirely flat as well. Something I didnt realized I was depending on was the ease or intensity of Phil Mills deliveries of the calls in Dirt Rally 2--its like he knew to highlight certain pieces of information that were far more relevant to the driver than just a literal description of the flow of turns. I miss that guy a lot.

In EA WRC, the co-driver sounds like an automated answering machine and sorta behaves like it too.

---But lets talk about Performance.---

Everyone's right. There are some like... woeful performance hangups in a game that doesnt even that graphically demanding. They're all over the place. Lots of momentary hang ups or freezes or pop ins. When you're winding through the narrow and fully iced-up corners of the villages in Rally Monty Carlo, you will notice these hiccups, and they will be very frustrating.

The combo between weird co-driver programming and performance issues alone sully a solid driving experience. If they can make this feel like their F1 titles, then we'll be in business. In the meantime, I'll be seeking a refund for EA WRC.",1706993126,1708875656,False,3,0,0.511945426464080811,0,True,False,False

    [*] The FOV for cockpit view is TERRIBLE. Knowing full damn well people play on triple screens, yet the FOV is set such that you only have a window around the size of an ipad mini to see the incoming track details
    [*] To get this game to run smoothly you must have to go and re-write a bunch of code... I CANNOT get it to play well at all. 1% lows <20fps, a screen-tear/stutter line that makes it look like a CRT and that's on LOW with a RTX3070
    [*] There's no launch control for take-off?? I understand Dirt 2.0 not having it, but these hybrids are renowned for their insane anti-lag launch control on startup.
    [*] The menu setup is absolute dog s.... Again, knowing [b] FULL WELL [/b] that people have proper sim rigs, typically with a tacho setup at the bottom middle of the primary monitor, yet that's where these geniuses put all of their menu features... It's an issue specifically to a small community, but it's frustrating as hell for me.
    [*] The Co-pilot calls, even on [i] earliest [/i] are still too late... Dirt 2.0 had this nailed for pace note timing.. this game cooked it.

Pros:
-Handling
-Car builder
-Cool routes and locations
-Sounds
-Wrc cars 

Cons:
-Graphics (Some stages look gorgeous and some stages look like from Dirt Rally 1)
-Performance
-Lackluster career
-Confusing season calendar
-Trash livery editor
-Battle pass in a 50$ game
-Some moments and rewards are locked behind EA Play subscription
-Photo mode, better than nothing but it feels like it's from 2012

Despite the cons, rallying in this game is incredibly fun and very well made. So if you do not care about any of the cons, go ahead and buy this. But it will need some major updates before i can fully recommend this game. Right now besides the driving it's 6/10. 

UPDATE:
Well surprise surprise, the game is still mediocre, anti aliasing is still not existent, washed out textures without dlss/fsr. Content is still being locked behing EA PLAY.

A ton of stuttering even on the lowest of settings, broken menus, broken liveries and textures... thought about refunding the game, but gave it some time. After first big update it now runs a lot better. It is actually playable with decent visuals and I can run it in my screen's native resolution as well. That seems good to me since my PC is just barely making minimum requirements.

So far I didn't try career, I am mostly playing in Clubs and Time Trial modes, just because I don't have a ton of free time to give to the game.

My positives:
- stage design. I thought WRC Generations and DR2 had good stages, but this is on another level. Being from Croatia it is nice to see some familiar places when running Rally Croatia.
- car models look amazing and nicely detailed. Cockpits may be a tad better, but I don't mind them how they are now
- Car Builder, although it gets repetitive after you build 3-4 cars. Hopefully they will add more customization to the cars (like NFS Carbon had with adjusting bumper openings, size etc)
- Sounds are immersive enough

Negatives:
- Livery editor - coming from WRC Generations this is a massive let down, but at least it is better than what we get in F1 games
- inability to change co-drivers nationality. Just because I have English speaking co-driver doesn't mean my pretend co-driver is British
- tarmac rallies - the car is so twitchy I just can't go without crashing or being way off the pace.
- driver, co-driver and other character models. They look like they are fit for 2 generations ago

The game is fun, handling feels improved (= easier lol) compared to Dirt Rally 2. Career mode is cool (even though the voice overs can get repetitive), rally school is a good addition (even though I wish It'd go more in-depth) and the livery editor, while basic, is great to have.

Now, the bad points :
- Battle pass which locks content away FOREVER if you don't finish it in time
- Performance issues for some people, though for me, they've been completely gone since the last update
- No VR and no release date for it
- EA

This game is fun, handling is improved / easier but...

-> ""battle pass"" : I do not have the time to max out each season, so some customisation items (such as liveries which are only in the last levels) will be forever locked out due to not being completed in time... which I paid for...

-> no apparent way to contact support

-> stuttering CAME BACK after an update that was supposed to fix it

There's not much advances from Codemasters since Dirt Rally 2.0, but WRC is still a very nice rally litesim.

+ Driving physics feels a bit less floaty compared to 2.0 which is nice, and they finally fixed tarmac grip model.
+ They still have ""Clubs"" system for async rally events multiplayer, and it works fine.
+ Game has a ton of new rally locations and some historic rally cars we didn't had in 2.0.

- Somehow they managed to make UI less intuitive than before, but I've got accustomed to it in a few hours. Also the human models they show in menus are uncanny.
- Graphics sometimes looks like a downgrade compared to 2.0, but it's not awful.

----------------
Welcome to ""Colin McRae Rally 10"", Codemasters latest rally game now published by Electronic Arts. Once again, Codemasters has managed to deliver an engaging driving experience, striking the right balance between avoiding boredom (unlike Dirt 5) and sparing players from the headaches found in hard core simulations like Richard Burns Rally. 

The driving experience closely resembles that of Dirt Rally 2.0 but In contrast to Dirt Rally 1.0 it's challenging to initiate drifts even on loose surfaces, and at low speeds when driven via keyboard, the virtual steering wheel returns to neutral a bit slowly. Anyway it's giving an overall good driving feel. 

If you loved the Colin McRae Rally game series and Dirt Rally 2.0, you won't be disappointed with EA Sports WRC. There are only a few pros and cons I would like to mention still:

- The childish trash talk of Dirt 3 is back.

The whole seasonal aspect/battlepass just kinda killed it for me, It's extremely grindy, and doesn't reward you well enough for the time spent. 
And the thing is with these games, its not game time, its driving time. So it is utterly physically exhausting to continue playing this game to grind a battlepass. 
The career is just a repeating set of events that never change, the club aspect while awesome doesn't hold a candle to the community events of DR2. 
I enjoy the more refined handling, and visuals in certain lighting. (Sunrise and sunset are the best and beat DR2 imo.)
But I find DR2 to be a far more enjoyable and visually pleasing experience overall.

There's aspects I like and ones I don't. But I've gone back to DR2 and uninstalled this in all honesty.

It's definitely was launched in very rough state, but right now after a few patches it feels and plays much better than at launch and much closer to expirience that we expected to see

Pros
- tracks are long and fun, feels like much better version of DR 2.0(Dirt Rally)
- huge amount of regions on start and a few new more have been added free of charge
- option to change seasons is nice and welcome, but works not on all regions in the same way
- wow, finally we have tutorials in rally game that don't suck
- subjectively, i want to emphasize on SUBJECTIVELY, car behavior while driving is better than in DR 2.0 and massively better than in previous WRC mostly because of the option to apply tuning in non career modes that helps with mitigating some input specifics and adopt to driving style 
- music in main menu is just wow
- much better multiplayer options than in DR 2.0 and wrcg/wrc9, even crossplatform private championship finally is working and setup could be done from game itself

Cons
- game feels pricey for many of my friends while comparing to DR 2.0 and previous WRC games that are packed with the same amount of content, but cheaper
- performance is still in some rare cases is not ideal, here and there you still could face some micro stutters, especially on tracks that weren't driven before
- season settings on some tracks feels like doing nothing
- rally pass is hidden in menus and don't have details how to achieve exp/rating in other activities and unlickily it's content isn't appealing to spend time on it
- a lot of cars don't have alternative liveries
- graphics feels worse than in WRCG and DR2.0, especially water and other weather effects, while overall geometry/environment complexity is much bigger and tracks are longer. DR 2.0 and WRC9 while displaying much less details in some occasions looks much more visually appealing, probably because of better color grading/palette
- menu navigation is worse than in all mentioned games, especially in car tuing section where in dirt rally you was able to switch between screens with only one button, in EA WRC you need to open each screen individually
- current AI difficulty require refinement, I was testing it with constant value of 70% and in some regions I could easily be faster for more than minute than AI, while in others i easily could be 1-2 mins behind it

Overall mentioned cons after a few patches feels not critical for me, but i still hope that some parts will be improved/addressed in future.",1708449517,1708449517,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

Alright, so because the game has been on a deep sale recently (I wonder why...), I have decided to re-purchase it and give it another shot, now that several patches have been rolled out.

Performance first: It's playable now. I still experience weird microstutters here and there, but on the Ultra preset, at 1440p, the game generally maintains a consistently high framerate. That comes at the cost of pretty high GPU utilization though, so I doubt it's going to run as well even on slightly older and less powerful cards.

Unfortunately, I have to stand by my opinion that the lighting makes the game look dreadful, compared to Dirt Rally 2.0 in particular. Everything at daytime is overexposed. It almost seems like they built the entire game around HDR1000 monitors being widespread or something to compensate this... Though I believe this is just what happens when you are unable to correctly handle the Unreal Engine. It's nothing new, sadly.

Now, having actually put some time into the game now and played around with its various systems, yeah, I can say that it's fun. It's hard for my to pinpoint exactly where I should put the game realism-wise, but I'd say it's definitely closer to a Dirt Rally 2.0 than the older WRC games, particularly those before WRC 10 and Generations, which were actually quite good and realistic. Not so much the titles before them.

What does maintain to be an unfixable issue is the horrible career UX/UI. Compared to WRC Generations, this is utter trash design. Unintuitive, difficult to navigate and comprehend.
For instance, right off the bat upon starting a new career, in week 1, you'll be presented with multiple ""cards"" that you cannot participate in, because they require an older vehicle. The others are garage and engineer slot expansions. And in the midst of those, there is an invitational event rallye which gives you a Lancia Fulvia HF as a loaner, and that's the one you're actually supposed to participate in to gain reputation with your sponsors, but it's so horribly telegraphed that I'm sure a lot of players straight missed it.

However, the Moments mode is good fun and there is something about immersing yourself in rallyes of the past by watching short clips from the WRC video archive, which are integrated into the game, and then taking on a challenge stage, like Sweden at nigh, during a snowstorm, without co-driver calls. Most of these are ""inspired"" by, rather than actual past happenings in WRC, but still, it's a nice idea and decent execution.

So I'd say, on a sale, yeah, EA WRC is worth the buy now. Even though full price isn't ""full price"" though, my original opinion below remains. It's not worth the asking price due to how amateurish large portions of the game have been designed. Which is why I will be leaving my review as a negative one.
_________________________
[Original negative review at the time of Early Access, heavily shortened now using GPT-4 due to its excessive length and my own ramblings:]
Codemasters' launch of EA Sports WRC, post their acquisition by EA, was a huge letdown. Despite the switch from their EGO Engine to Unreal Engine for better stage details and environments, the game disappointingly lacks the vibrant lighting and atmosphere that defined their previous titles. The performance is abysmal – even on high-end systems like mine with an RTX 4090 and 7950X3D, the game struggles with low frame rates and stutters, varying wildly between stages. The inconsistent performance, combined with shader compilation issues during gameplay, detracts significantly from the experience.

Despite these flaws, the game does offer decent content. The intuitive controls, a blend of Dirt Rally 2.0 and WRC Generations, alongside a variety of modes like Rally School, Time Trials, and Career Mode, provide some enjoyment. The sound design is generally good, although occasionally inconsistent. The vehicle physics are passably realistic and enjoyable.

However, the game is plagued by numerous bugs, an overdesigned UI, and missing textures, reflecting a decline in Codemasters' quality and communication strategy under EA's influence. The potential for future monetization through DLCs is concerning.

I have decided to refund the game and cannot recommend purchasing it at this stage. It's disheartening to see Codemasters, a studio I've followed since TOCA Race Driver 1, release a game in such a state. EA Sports WRC, in its current form, lacks the soul and quality of Codemasters' previous titles and is a low point for the studio.",1699012166,1708396084,False,12,2,0.531914889812469482,0,True,False,False

Since Dirt Rally 2.0 came free with my purchase of WRC I decided to give it a go. With less than 1 hour of play under my belt it is clear this game gets everything right that WRC gets wrong. Facts first rather than opinion. It has official in game VR support. The implementation of the VR is superb. If you play on a monitor you have in cockpit views that allow you to see where you are going. Now my opinion. The graphics for me are better, smooth, no stuttering so far and high frame rates to boot. Early days but the co driver calls need some adjustment on my part to suit my style. It is a no brainer. Dirt Rally 2.0 is a way way way better game  than WRC. 

Just under 50 hrs played. In short, this game cannot be recommended and for me is yet another example of EA/Codemasters securing a licence and ruining it for everyone.

This has nothing to do with all the talk of stuttering and lag. On high/ultra settings with a bog standard RTX3080 I see none of that and the game runs more than smooth enough. Yes some Monte Carlo stages require a lowering of the odd graphic setting  to avoid game crashes but that has been well documented elsewhere and affects even those with mighty RTX4000 series cards. However if eye candy level graphics is your thing then you will be disappointed. Even maxed out the game just does not look very good.

Two things for me destroy the play ability of this game. 

First is the co driver calls. Despite the ability to adjust them (earlier or later) they are just too often wrong. Too often all the good effort you have put into the stage run is for nothing as you are left wondering what on earth the co driver was thinking with that last call. Yes you can repeat stages using the restart option but if you end up learning stages then it sought of makes having a co driver irrelevant and this is supposed to be a rally game/sim.

Secondly is the total lack of official VR support. Yes it was only promised post launch but it has been long enough now, so where is it? But not many people have/use VR i hear you saying. While I disagree with you that is not the point I am making. The point is that without VR support any attempt to drive in cockpit view is so so frustrating and at times impossible because you simply cannot see where you are going! The in game ability to adjust that view is not only limited to one of the internal car views but the adjustments available are next to useless. Adjust away as much as you want but you still will never have full view of where you are going at times. VR is the only hope to correct this and even then it is not a guarantee.

While waiting for VR I am sure I will struggle on but as In said at the outset in its current state I cannot recommend this game.",1705848326,1708249117,False,6,0,0.541723191738128662,0,True,False,False

The hype around the WRC license being given to another studio whose proven success with the Dirt Rally series gave hope to the idea that something could finally replace the twenty-something year old Richard Burns Rally for the throne of realistic rally simulation. I love the graphics, I love the sounds, I love the variety of cars to drive and most of all I love the track design for how immersive each stage feels. 

What I really cannot understand though is how there has been around four years since the release of Dirt Rally 2.0 and yet in all that time Codemasters have been unable to fix the unplayable tarmac physics and unrealistically gripped up handling of the short wheelbase cars. There are so many tracks and cars which simply aren't enjoyable to drive due to the unpredictable nature of their tire and suspension physics. Turn the wheel more than 25 degrees from 0 either way and the vast majority of the cars will loop with no possible recourse. It's really frustrating that a game devoted to rally content is less enjoyable as a whole than the 5 rally cross DLC cars featured in Automobilista 2, a game which seems to have put the same amount of effort into both their gravel/dirt physics as they did the game's main focus; tarmac. Don't get me wrong, there are a handful of cars where in the right situation (gravel/dirt/snow) make for the most immersive rally experience I can think of, but that's just it. It's only a handful. 20-40% of the game's content at best. I stopped choosing to play tarmac stages, just like I stopped choosing to drive the vast majority of the short wheelbase AWD cars. Not because I don't want to but because It's simply such a frustrating experience every single time I get lured in to the trap of thinking ""maybe it'll be different with x car and x stage combo"".

I don't think this is a bad game, just an incredibly disappointing one. It has all the potential to be patched and become a more robust rally simulator if the developers choose to do that. The problem is though people have been complaining about these same exact issues in DR2.0 for years now and if those responsible for this game's direction didn't listen then, i'm pretty sure they won't listen now.

This game will have positive reviews after the optimization and the price point is fantastic, a sale will put this at an ultra-value-must-get price.

I changed my review to not recommend as the first patch didn't even fix some very noticeable things.

After day 1 of my career first event AI goes from beating me pretty good on 100 to me being 4 mins ahead after day 2, its like AI went to 0 difficulty... like, this is plainly obvious no one even did a run through of a career in testing.

Graphics still have some major stutters going on. 

Sadly EA has ruined Codemasters best series.

________________________________________

I dunno what these patches are doing, if anything at all. The AI still goes into super easy mode for some reason. I was behind 30s in rally vs 100 AI and got it all back and won the whole rally by 1m24s 

That being said, i can't not recommended the game. Still addicting and the time trails are fun. The feel on my wheel is great too.

I can only get the game to run at a semi stable rate if I bump everything down to ""ultra low"" and set AMD fidelity FX to ultra performance, to where the game basically looks worse than a mid 2000's internet flash game... no I'm not kidding, try it and see for yourself.  Even at that setting though its stuttering constantly.  Bumping settings even up to low or god forbid medium and the game becomes unplayable.  Stuttering and skipping every second of the stage.  Keep in mind this is at 1080p.  I've got a pc at the recommended specs, so this is inexcusable.  I'm fully capable of running ACC ultra 1440p 60fps buttery smooth, so its not that I'm just trying to run it on a 300 dollar integrated graphics potato or anything.  Keep in mind a large selling point of the ""VIP early access"" was ACCESS TO THE FUCKING GAME EARLY.  Now we are told we have to wait til after the release date to recieve any sort of patch... basically rendering the early access useless.  I did my due diligence, I waited for reviewers to come out that I trusted.  They all said the game was good.  Well IDK if they were playing on console (which supposedly works better) or what.  But that was not remotely close to my experience. 

   Shame on you codemasters and EA for releasing this broken unfinished mess of a ""game""  (I use that term loosely).  You knew damn well the game wasnt ready for pc users and you did fuck all to remedy this.  Instead deciding on scooping up our money and giving us a fat middle finger.  I'll be refunding this game and will be getting an actually good game like robocop that is made by developers/publishers that have some basic fucking integrity and release games when they are DONE.  What an absolute insult this game is to the wrc name.  I had such high hopes codemasters was going to knock this out of the park.  The tracklist and car list were all fantastic.  But none of that matters if the game DOESNT WORK.

EDIT:  Upon further testing it seems for some reason using any upscaler (amd fx or nvidia dlss)  is what would cause the game to stutter constantly, for some reason they made the game unplayable.  With all upscalers turned off i'd say it goes from being straight unplayable to borderline unplayable.  I could technically limp through a stage now, although it would be incredibly frustrating and annoying trying to anticipate when the game would suddenly decide to freeze for a second or drop down to 20fps.  If you can enjoy a racing game where you're constantly missing corners and crashing due to the game stuttering and having massive frame drops, be my guest.  I'm getting my money back.  I genuinely cant enjoy a game that has this bad performance.  It's incredible the amount of people that are defending this crap.  If it works great for you, congratulations,  take your cookie and Fuck off.  For a very large portion of customers the game is having serious performance issues.  Give me all the clown awards you want.  Idk what part about me wanting a game that functions makes me a clown, but so be it.  This is the state in gaming these days.  Having a legitimate grievance with the game you paid for?  ""Shut up, quite whining, you're just a hater"".  I hope you guys get paid by EA for the amount of hours you spend arguing and calling people names who are having issues with the game.  God forbid people want a game that works when it gets released.

Edit #2 (After patch 1.5): The game is still a stuttering mess for me.  All the upscalers make the stuttering problem 5x worse when enabled, this is the only game I've encountered where turning on dlss or fsr makes the game run WORSE.  Completely bizarre.  TLDR: Still a joke, still a rip off.  EA clearly pushed this game out waaaay before it was ready for launch.",1699013856,1708052352,False,2,0,0.458015263080596924,0,True,False,False

Completely ruins the game, thought it might have been a coding issue so waited to post a review after the first patch had dropped. The Codemasters team managed to dial back a bit of the game breaking stutters caused by  the horrid copy protection but once again Denuvo strikes, attacking the paying customer!, at this point I really don't know what I was thinking buying this game aware that Denuvo was present but I needed a racing game to fill the hole that Forza Motorsport left after walking away from that.

When will the game studios stop using Denuvo in games and take the 10 odd percent hit to the pocket from filesharing? instead of pushing away customers by adding it and degrading the gameplay as IS clearly evident here.

Ok so that aside the tracks are interesting (when it's not glitching) but the track surface is a massive step backwards from Dirt Rally 2.0, there's little feel in the surface like grooves and potholes and just feels flat and empty after a few hours of play. Tarmac is downright horrible and there's too much of it in a rally game fullstop

The Sounds are top notch and the choice of menu music is more enjoyable than the game 10 hours in.

Career mode is clunky & confusing but you can always start again.

Night time is a joke and headlights make the track surface look like Colin McRae rally back in the early 2000's and at the first chance I switch off the headlights or that annoying lightbar that takes up valuable viewing space on the bonnet view

The only upside I'm seeing to this game after 10 hours is that the price was reasonable for what it is even tho it's pretty bland after the initial few hours of play and the copy protection that degrades the game completely, this is a driving game and micro-stutters and game freezes when bumping any trackside object because of something that doesn't need to be there, or it does cause they don't want to lose the 10-20 percent to pirates has pushed me away for good.

I'll eventually get my moneys worth after 6 months when they drop Denuvo out in a patch and the game runs as it was intended and then I might edit this review, but as of now, Not Worth a Buy, Wait till they drop Denuvo and attacking their customers.

Edit: Just tried it again because it's was on sale at half price, still has the stutters when anything apart from being completely on track happen plus now it feels like the whole weight of the vehicles has vanished from what was at launch, like it's been dumb'ed down to the level of an EA game or previous WRC titles. such a shame that rally has to feel flat an lifeless, why can't we have a game that's a challenge like Dirt Rally 2.0 and before, really this new to gaming stuff has to end or can the developers add options in the settings to make vehicles realistic and challenge to drive!

This is really great game with great physics and long stages, but there are some issues and problems that would be good to solve. Everything else I won't mention here is good, I am going to talk only about problems.

First of all, we should say that the game is made in Unreal Engine 4. It is bad by itself. Nowadays, it would be much better optimized and it would looked better if it was made in Unreal Engine 5.


There are problems like:
Graphical problems
Optimalization problems
Enviromental problems on stages
Hitbox problems on stages
Settings problems


Graphical problems: The game doesn't look as good as it could look, it seems to me that it was released quickly and that it didn't get as much love and work as it should have.

Optimalization problems: The game is very badly optimized, and it looks like it doesn't run as well as it should, it doesn't look particularly good on Ultra and even if you want it to run smoothly, you have to set it to even lower settings.

Enviromental problems os stages: It is really nice to have a long stages, but in this game they are boring. They would certainly be much better if there were more spectators, you would hear the spectators shouting at you and the overall atmosphere would also be better, there could be something more, more houses, more objects, more unexpected events like a crashed car along the stage. WRC Generations has terrible physics, but when I compare it with EA WRC, the worlds in Generations are much better and you can enjoy the game better and the stages look more realistic.

Hitbox problems on stages: On some stages there are hitbox problems, but they are getting fixed, so I am happy they are trying to fix them.

Settings problems: The game is not supporting the latest dlss or frame generation (even wrc generations is supporting them)


And the last problem I personaly have is that there is no coodriver multiplayer mode in this game, which was great fun and I was able to have a good time with a friend is WRC Generations.

As I said, this is really great game, that misses on some things that would make this game perfect, so I give my thumbs down to the fact that my expectations were not met.

I hope that in the future we will get game, that is made in good engine, looking good, properly optimized, and it is more fun.",1707937251,1707937324,False,11,0,0.524155676364898682,0,True,False,False

Two reasons, the primary being performance. My average FPS is 94. It does not matter which graphics options I choose, there are lots of frame drops. I can run Dirt Rally 2 with max graphics options and keep a stable 120 FPS (except when the game inappropriately checks USB settings, a frame is dropped). For WRC, it drops frames in every race, with some races losing multiple frames in a row.  This detracts GREATLY from the driving experience. Since steady framerate is absolutely central to the driving experience, this reason alone is enough to justify not recommending this game.

But there is more. My biggest complaint is that whomever is in charge of making the game more 'difficult', has gone way beyond their mandate in Dirt Rally2 and WRC. They have manipulated the co-driver calls to be deceitful in a number of places. Seriously, if you want to make it difficult like THAT, then just paint the windscreen black and force people to listen for clues. Thankfully, this can be somewhat mitigated now by choosing the simplified calls for the co-driver, but it does not completely alleviate the situation. The game absolutely should be hard and I LOVE that about this game. Insisting that skill alone determines who wins is perfect. Manipulating co-driver calls like that is like Tonya Harding knee-capping Nancy Kerrigan. Well duh, someone with a hurt leg can't skate well. Who would have thought?

Minor complaint: The reasons given to drive are terrible. Career? Yeah, sure. I win my first event by coming in at least 30 seconds before everyone else in all races. Result? 4th place. Two other teams had the same score as myself and one team (Gazoo Racing) has one more point than  I did. On the first event. That I thoroughly won. Okay... and apparently, I have another driver on my 'team' that I have to buy a car for. I have no further interactions with this driver other than having to manage their budget and let them use my engineers. This is fun? This is a reason to drive?

The game itself is worth about $10, maybe $20 if they can get it to actually perform reasonably. If they fixed the performance and the co-driver calls, this game would be worth the asking price. If they fixed 'career' mode, the game would be worth more than its asking price. As it is? I may just go back to Dirt Rally 2 to get my driving fix until EA shuts that down. And that is the final reason to never buy this game: You don't own it. They can take it away from you at their convenience.

EDIT 2023/11/25:
I turned the advanced graphics options to ultra low. I set the resolution to 1920x1080.

120 frames per second at 30% GPU usage and 20% CPU usage.

And it still drops frames. It stutters.

The driving feels fantastic and fun, but several times per race, it will stutter. Sometimes, just a frame or two, other times, for dozens of milliseconds. I am running on patch 1.3 and these issues are still as prevalent as they were in Early Access.

I am extremely disappointed. This software is not fit for purpose.

Edit: 2023/12/19 83 hours, patch 1.4

After adjusting my memory timings in my BIOS/UEFI, I was able to get rid of much of the stutter.
After patch 1.4, I was able to play at 4k at mostly 120 FPS.
There are still milliseconds long frame dropping issues. This seems to happen mostly in critical situations where the limits are being pushed. Understandable in one way; however, incredibly frustrating in another way. You are in a rally that you can't restart and when you are going around a critical turn, all frames drop as you hit a bump. By the time the screen starts redrawing, you are off the track or, if you are lucky, able to save it from veering wildly off track.

The driving is fun. Doing time trials, it doesn't matter if I crash from dropped frames. Still, I am sad to be reduced to time trials.

EDIT 2024, 02, 14

I gave version 1.5.1 a sincere try. It is a significant improvement over previous versions; however, it is still not suitable as an actual rally racing game. The stop motion animation nature of what is displayed is still a thing which makes it completely unsuitable for actual racing.

I have to admit, the driving itself is VERY fun. Running meaningless time trials is perfectly acceptable as the driving is awesome and you can always just reset if any of the stuttering causes you issues in a race.

I do not know if I will continue waiting for this software to become acceptable for actual racing. Electronic Arts has been notorious since the 1990s for not giving the devs they bought out the resources necessary to actually do their jobs properly. Hiring someone who is an actual expert at the Unreal engine couldn't have been terribly expensive, and yet they refused to do so. So now, we need to wait for the resident devs to become experts on the 'new' engine and EA corporate doesn't have the patience for that. This game will die and end the franchise entirely. :(

I'm on a 2060 and having no issues at all after the recent patches. Many people are complaining that this game looks bad; sure it doesn't look quite as good as DR 2.0 in a lot of ways but its still quite nice looking. 

For those complaining about blurryness, learn more about TAA and upscaling before you start slinging crap about a game's visuals. 

The physics are believable. That counts for a lot. I feel like it's on the other end of the spectrum from RBR, where in RBR many surfaces feel icy and lateral grip is unrealistically minimal. In WRC you have more lateral grip in the same unrealistic way. I gotta say though, throwing my IRL Impreza around in the dirt feels much more like WRC than RBR, but very subtly so. RBR to me is still the most realistic rally title (especially damage-wise), but WRC is good enough to the point where its perfectly reasonable to compare one to the other. The gap is shrinking. Both titles are dancing around the true physics realism line, each on its own side of the spectrum. RBR, in my opinion, still comes out slightly on top.

If you want a more feature rich rally game, WRC is your best bet. If you want a different kind of feature rich but arguably more authentic sim then RBR is still on top. It's up to you to decide if these pissing contests are important to you or not. The bottom line is that both games are fun in their own way.

I've played RBR for 10 years now. To me, RBR is excellent and so is WRC so far. You're likely to have a decent experience with this game (ie: you won't be distracted by cringeworthy physics - looking at you DR 2.0 tarmac). Its playable, enjoyable and certainly challenging.

This game gets a lot of hate because it's EA - let's take EA out of it and be honest:

Some people get performance issues - previously I did, I've had none since the last patch thankfully.  But the stuttering I had was 0.5 seconds for each first run of the stage (shader compilation in Unreal engine being the culprit) as I said since last patch I don't get any. 

[EDIT 20/01/24] - The stuttering returned post-patch on the first run of each stage again during the first hour of play - after the first hour it was all good again. Slightly annoying, but at least it didn't stay! It's as if patching cleared the shader patch.

Car handling on gravel and snow is great, very enjoyable and FUN to drive. Tarmac is way better than Dirt Rally 2.0, but it's very twitchy. Is it realistic? I have no idea, I've never driven a rally car IRL (much like 99% of people here I guess..), but it's believable and as I said fun to drive. Certainly miles above DR2.0 when it comes to handling.

On cars - there's so many different classes and so many different cars to choose from. Outside of RBR mods this is the best rally car selection in any game.

The car builder is a nice addition - I didn't think I'd use it, but I've made 5 cars in it now with different layouts in different classes. It's a fun addition! My main issue with it is the cars you end up making all look like they come from between 2004-2014. They don't look like modern cars at all!

Stage design is good - and it should be they're apparently based on real roads! But for me it lacks the fine detail of the Klyoton WRC stages which made them really good. For example - the atmosphere is pretty flat. Spectators don't look at your car as it goes past - they're all staring into the middle distance as if they have something on their minds.

The stage degradation feature doesn't seem to do much. I was excited when hearing about this, but the stages feel the same, ruts don't seem to get deeper.

Career mode is broken. Don't play this right now. Currently if I resume my career in the middle of a rally the AI difficulty breaks and I end up 2-3 minutes per stage faster than them. This isn't the case if I do the full rally in 1 go. The benefactor and mix of calendar events feels like a carry over from the last WRC game - I wonder if this is a requirement from WRC rather than codemasters choosing to put it in?

[EDIT 20/01/24] - Since 1.4.1 patch it is better. You can resume mid-rally and most of the time it works. But my first resume mid-rally I had 1 stage with cars the right speed, 1 stage with the cars the wrong speed (I was 4 min faster), after that they were all fine again...

Clubs and time trials are where the fun is - join some clubs and compete against other real life people. It's so much fun to try and hit that perfect stage to see how high up the leaderboards you get. Better still, create a club for you and your friends and you can constantly try and beat them! Time trials as well - I ended up with a couple of WRs trying to beat a friend's time on one stage. We spent a week trading times and pushed ourselves to the top! 

Finally the overall look of the game - Unreal engine was a strange choice, but the ""Codemasters brown filter"" still exists where it looks like you're seeing through a layer of brown all the time. Particle effects look great though, close up everything looks good, but the traditional unreal blurriness at distance is still a problem.

Overall I do recommend this game, but I guess the good and bad looks like this...
Good:
- Cars are believable with how they drive but very fun to drive
- Huge variety of cars
- Stage design is good
- Clubs and Time Trials are great fun
- Great looking effects (dust trails etc)
- Car builder is reasonably in depth and is a nice addition

Bad:
- Stage degradation doesn't seem to do much
- Stages lack atmosphere, Spectators never look at your car
- Tarmac handling is way too twitchy around the centre of the wheel rotation
- Performance issues (resolved for me)
- It looks like you're seeing through a layer of brown all the time
- VR not here yet

[Edit 13/02/24]
Indifferent
- Career mode (previously bad) works now, I just wish it  had a bit more depth to it!
[/Edit]

So yes, I recommend this game, it's not perfect. But it's the best modern rally game we have right now if you just want to drive rally cars. (RBR+mods does not count as modern...). If career mode is your thing, wait until it's fixed before buying.

To address some comments:
- Stutter is hit and miss for most people, for me it's fine again (since shader cache rebuilt), but if I had constant stutter like a lot of people then I wouldn't be recommending this game. 
- Professional yapper...? Just trying to be open and clear based on how I feel the game is...
- Agree it feels great on a controller too, I have tried a few stages on my Xbox pad and it felt surprisingly good!
- I run a TX because I can't afford to upgrade yet - but I fail to see the point? 
- List of cons with recommendation - it's based on the driving experience, stage variety and car selection, which I find to be very good, believable and fun.

As of today, this game runs great (60+) without stutters at medium graphics on my RTX 2070M and I have to say I'm having a blast

The physics are much better tuned than Dirt Rally 2, I can really feel weight transferring through the car and asphalt no longer feels like driving on oil. I adjusted to the handling of the cars very quickly and I've been driving faster and more controlled than I ever have in DR2. Compared to something like Assetto Corsa I'd say the controls are a little snappier, but not in an unpredictable way. Typically I drive rally cars with my steering set to 540 degrees but WRC feels better at 400 for this reason. I do have to say the audio design needs a little improvement, the game sounds *fantastic* but it's not quite as realistic as DR2. If I puncture or lose a tire in DR2 I can immediately tell which one it is just by listening to the sounds of the car, in EA WRC not only does it seem like my tires are nearly invincible, I can't hear which one it is. That being said, you can repair your tires roadside at no penalty (at least in time trial mode) in EA WRC so this is kind of a moot point.

I think where EA WRC really shines is in the force feedback. I'm not a rally driver and I don't race cars, so I'm kind of just guessing here, but through each turn, jump, and bump, you can really feel the car react and transfer its weight. It's a difficult thing to describe with words, but going at 110mph around a 5 left, you can feel the gravel sliding under the wheels and fighting you while you steer, but it's easy to gauge how much force you need to give it before you spin out. You can feel when you approach turns too fast, or when your steering isn't quite aligned with the direction you're sliding. It's truly responsive and I immediately saw improvement in my own driving compared to DR2.

For all intents and purposes this is Dirt Rally 3.0 and I'm quite happy with that. I wish it wasn't published by EA but if that's what it took, I can accept that. I'm just happy to finally get behind the wheel of the WRC GR Yaris and wrap myself around some trees.",1707757915,1707757915,True,1,1,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

STILL NOT REOMMENDED!!!!

This time the patch solely focused on performance; and whilst it has made a big difference to the game in that regard, we are now a whole 4 months after release; and still waiting for performance to be satisfactory. 

There are still numerous graphical and gameplay bugs. There are still gfx settings that cause the game to crash.  Literally no other fixes since 1.4.1 and game is still full of immersion breaking bugs. 

The UI is underdeveloped and illogical. I would recommend anybody thinking of buying this game to check out the open issues under bug reports and also technical issues reported here: https://answers.ea.com/t5/EA-SPORTS-WRC/ct-p/wrc-en",1699099008,1707756427,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

TLDR: recommended [b]for true rally (-game) enthusiasts[/b], driving [i]using wheels [/i] who have a [i]high tolerance for sporadic performance-problems[/i] [u](check up on your system-specs!!!)[/u]

solid recommendation when price is right (e.g. 50% off ~ €25)

The good:
when it runs smooth, it is now an enjoyable drive...
...minus the over-processed co-driver audio-channels. What were they thinking compressing and adding colouring on top of colouring until most of the voice sounded like a computer-generated ""welcome to, plese leave a message after the krrrrk"" on a very old and abused answering-machine, coming of a pre-used cassette-tape?

But for those who have 6+ modern CPU-cores, running at stable, high frequencies: this might be the successor to the ""Dirt Rally"" franchise that we have been eagerly waiting for since 2019. And in true Codemasters-fashion: the product matures in the hands fo the consumer! If you are like me and tend to ride out your system from yesteryear, maybe put in a current-day GPU once the stupid crypto- and AI-hype-driven prices have calmed down half-way, you better own a Display capable of adaptive refresh-synchonisation (""freesync""; ""g-sync""), as the 1%_lows will otherwise destroy your fun. 

5820k running 4.2core / 3.7cache means 1%_lows in the lower to upper 40s. Some scenes dropping into the mid-30s! Average-fps would show between 60..80. 

They want you to provide a 9th-gen Intel or ""Zen2""-6core at the minimum - probably for that very reason. And make sure it is adequately cooled so it can hold it's boost-frequencies during playtime! 

Then again: [list]
[*] FFB: a solid equals or most-definitely better than DR2.0! But needs tweaking with levels as allways
[*] Visibility can be better or worse than DR2.0, so better make sure your GPU has the horsepower to run 
  [list]
  [**]track detail: high
  [**]dynamic objects: high (any less and  you will suffer massive pop-in deep into your reaction-zone in front for important stuff like road-signs and other (hard) objects marking road-limits)
  [**]post-processing: high
  [/list]
[*]co-driver: as discussed above, it is now audible with patch 1.5.1 but lacks tone and clarity a lot. And it can throw you off when driving without the slide-show of pitograms on screen.
[*]handling: this game's strong suit on loose surfaces. Tarmac has improved in terms of grip-levels but the tyres still seem a bit weird. No tyre pressures to adjust in this game, just as before with Dirt Rally titles - but they do now include:
[*]tyre-wear is now part of race-result tables as a short-hand icon. Green means: still like new, then yellow for some wear and red for close to worn-out. That's it - but it is still something I applaud for finally including with third attempt! It means you get a ""quick look"" at your tyres even after finishing the final stage of an event - which was sorely lacking in older titles! Really welcome!
[*] stages: are more plentyful, more varied and now longer than before. YES, YES, YES!
[*] also stages: I have not come across surface-degradation, yet. I hope it was not dropped as that made DR2.0 so dynamic and hard to master! But grip-levels are dynamic on loose surfaces as to favor the brushed tyre-trails noticeably.
[*] throttle-modeling seems more life-like, less ""canned"".
[/list]
So there you have it: A sold-as-complete public beta that shows some genuine improvements, sadly comes with performance-handicaps such as a rich hunger for CPU-cycles and lazy UE4 mid-stage shader-compilation (that seems to subside after all have been completed - until the next occasion you change GPUs or their respective drivers and the global shader-cache gets flushed).

I love the driving-experience, I dislike the apparent co-driver downgrade compared to both ""Dirt Rally"" titles that laid the foundation for this game. The audio-implementation in those prior titles was industry-leading and has now been discarded for no reason other than ""meh, can't be bothere!

In my initial review from about 3 weeks ago I said:

[quote]This thing is a massive ""technological disappointment"".[/quote]
And I had my reasons to ""only recommend on 50% off"".

I stand by this: it is now clear that these guys are trying to remedy the performance-side of things and polish it out. But sadly some aspects of what made the previous Codemasters releases stand out have been lost and are (hopefully) biding their time to make a comeback later. Probably not in this release is my guess - but hopefully the next one. As a German outlet titled fittingly in their video-review: [quote]

Pre-ordered because it was cheaper, which was nice, and it came with 5 VIP passes.

We are heading in to season 3 tomorrow, february 13th, and I have been unable to claim most of the rewards from season 1 or 2 due to the simple fact that the game wasn't very playable until the 1.5 patch about a week ago.
Performance is finally -okay- but still has many issues. For example turning on headlights drops your fps by a solid 20% and introduces microstuttering. Very nice when it's pitch black. Bloom/brightness reflections still come from the road surface, not from any actual light sources. None of this makes up for the fact that graphically it looks inferior to DiRT Rally 2.0, meaning poor performance for worse graphics is a really, really bad trade-off. This is due to reflections and mirrors needing to be turned off if you want to play this game. Turning these graphics settings up even slightly will break the game. You'll experience insane stuttering, tearing, and low fps in general. 

It could have been a good game, but honestly, I just fell for slick advertising and a very long, promising build-up towards release, of which i'd like to blame a few notable YouTubers like JimmyBroadbent for never talking about any of the negatives and praising this game in to high heaven.

The visuals are still a mixed bag and the VR support isn't there but the career mode is a huge improvement over Dirt Rally 2.0 in some aspects, it just takes a while to figure out how it works and what to focus on. 

My biggest gripe with the game is the graphics and lack of VR support, which is coming according to the devs. The graphics just look a little washed out in the environment in some areas thanks to Unreal's lighting and the drivers all look like they are having trauma flashbacks. Cars look great however and the track detail looks like it's improved a bit from Dirt Rally 2.0. 

Overall driving takes a bit to get used to and is a both different and similar to Dirt Rally 2.0, as in going slow and smooth is better but the cornering and handling is a little different. I actually prefer the hard tyres on gravel and dirt because the cars slide a bit more which helps cornering with a controller, using a wheel I'm sure is a totally different story.

Feb 9 24 edit:

After this weeks patch the game is in better shape. When it's running well the Codemaster's feel comes through and I'm having a great time. I do still miss DR2's events; the dailies, weeklies, and monthlies. They are somewhat clumsily replicated via Clubs (Online player created rally events, EA account link required).  The events had a fantastic Rally element of having exactly one shot and if you bin it you're done, try again next week. That's REAL rally.  
Moments are good for one off play but with unlimited retries it's just leaderboard chasing. Fine if that's what you like but that's speedrunning to me, not rally racing.

Hopefully this game will get the long support DR2 enjoyed and will similarly keep getting better and better with age.",1699322596,1707527599,True,0,0,0.501228511333465576,0,True,False,False

The driving and feedback are noticeably better although some AWD  seem to be a bit oversteery.

The maps range from looking better than Dirt 2.0 to 1000 times worse (3070 trio rtx ultra graphics).

The career mode is great but the Ai seems a little inconsistent.

Car models are (i think) too good when compared to the maps.

Roads often look too clean and don't have as much variation (in some maps) as Dirt 2.0

Game ran bad (generally) at launch but has gotten BETTER with time only freezing momentarily on occasion.

Its ok but has enough faults for me to play it noticeably less than Dirt 2.0

Bought a GTX 4070 Ti to try to solve the problem, but still stutters like crazy as you can see from the Framtimes. That should be a straight line and not look like some earthquake monitor.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3156828945

All my settings are at Ultra Low or OFF when possible. 

I cannot recommend a game that runs so bad. 

I always hated to call Dirt Rally series ARCADE, because I think they are not. 
But this!:

There is all the arcade stuff with sticks totaling your car, inconsistent hit markers on the sticks, AND sticks everywhere to force you to drive in a pothole that throws your car forward in a loop, with fireworks as it magically sticks  to your hood so you cannot see a damn thing until you crash. 

Hitting a few stick will make your hood jump up and down for the rest of the stage, and if it falls off, it will often glue itself to the windshield or some other stupid place where it is as distracting as possible,. What on earth were they thinking when implementing the magnet stuff? Seriously! 

Non of this happens in real life, and there are no sticks to limit cutting IRL, except to prevent gravel from being thrown onto the road when driving on Tarmac. In this game it's everywhere, even on grave!. 

Then there are the suface with invisible features that dooms youer car to drive into the woods. The way things are place is so that if you save the car, you will be guided into another obstical that change your direction again. It's too much and way too obvious, making it annoying more than enjoying. 

Codies have forgotten how to make roads difficult by how it turns and twists, and just made it something random and invisible that will ruin your run. It is just terrible.I don't mid throwing my car into a rock or a tree, but this stuff is ARCADE stuff. Some stages are 20 minutes, and being punished for things that would never happen IRL is stupid on a new level.  

I would be fine with it if it was impossible to make it more realistic, but the only thing they have to do is to remove the stupid stuff that does not happen many times a day IRL. 

Then there are ""sinkholes"". EVERYWHERE! Your car will sink down to the rim, only to hit the end of it which leads to your car flipping. :p






Old review:
Reviewed after 3.5 hours of play

GTX 1080 Ti with max OC.
Intel 5960X @4,7 GHz on all cores.

Very low Framerate even at lowest settings possible in Greece.. 

Frametimes at 50ms all the time. As comparison, DR2, which is much worse than DR1, The Frametimes would be from 7 to 12ms on my setup. A Frametime of 17, is about 60 FPS, so 50 is 20 FPS! At absolute best, I have 45ms Frametime, which is 22 FPS. 

How this new game can be so bad is just sad. Then there is the massive stutter all the time. The pause button is locked to number 4 and cannot be changed. Nice... I always dreamed of having the most used button hidden behind the gear stick, with no option to assign it to another button. :p 

This is DiRT4 and DR2 all over, but worse. An unfinished game that runs so poorly it's virtually unplayable in at least Greece..

When going to desktop and back, resolution setting is reset. :p 
Game will also go in Window mode when doing certain unrelated settings. 
You cannot drag the window to your liking as the ratio is fixed. This makes the stutter problem larger when recording, and file size also becomes unnecessary large.
 
I have TN panels in my monitors, and the gravel in Greece is almost completely washed out, making it very hard to see bumps and where the road actually is. 

EDIT: 

In Sweden it is a lot better with Frametimes. If I run on only 1 screen, I get Frametimes from 9-12ms. Problem is the massive amount of stutter. The stutter is Frametimes from 45 to 115 ms. 

The stages are nice, but the snow has no visible texture, everything is just white unless you turn down the light and contrast in nVidia or whatever external option you have to adjust picture. 

But the bloom! Bushes popping up of the ground, in the road, just a few meters in from of the car. So you look ahead end see where you can place the car for narrow a corner, when you get there, there are bushes popping up there that can make all kinds of problems for you. Besides being distracting, it's just very strange to have blooming so late, and so close to the track/view point. This may be bc of my low settings, but what can you do when it runs so badly?

Hopefully it does not take too long for some significant improvements. For now, I cannot recommend the game.

Patches have been coming out for this game at a pretty consistent pace which is reassuring. So far the stuttering issues have been getting better but they are not fully ironed out with the recent 1.3 patch.

Honestly this game gets way too much hate in my opinion. Maybe I'm just easy to please but I really enjoy this game. Graphics aren't the best but certainly not bad. Performance was troublesome for the first few stages but after shaders cache a bit most of the stuttering issues clear up. I'm running this game on a Radeon RX Vega 64 at 1080P and performance on the high preset with upscaling disabled gets me around 80FPS. Handling is great. Force feedback is definitely an upgrade over Dirt Rally 2.0. Out of the box settings are much better. Sound is also excellent. Tracks are well done with a crazy amount of complexity. There's a ton of content with a wide range of cars to drive. Not to mention a fully fledged car builder where you can build your own rally car with a variety of different parts, then stick your own custom livery on it and go racing. Not many games have that feature. Lastly, this game doesn’t require Origin / EA app so that’s a nice plus.

My opinions are probably biased because I run this game on a T300 wheel with old Fanatec CSR Elite pedals, alongside an SHH shifter on an original RSeat cockpit. The physics feel believable without being too brutal. There's a depth to this game that you simply won't get on a gamepad. That said, controller handling is still pretty good too. Highly recommend a wheel for this though. Dancing on the edge of control in a twitchy F2 kit car is a ton of fun. Tarmac stages don't feel floaty anymore and tires have actual traction. Handbrake turns are a joy. It's just really fun to drive. Sure it may not be up to the standards of heavily modded Richard Burns Rally but who cares. This game is basically Dirt Rally 3.0; or at least as close as we’re going to get. 

Career mode seems to have been fixed as of the 1.4.1 patch. Currently there's no VR support, and while I don't use VR, for those who do, that's a huge disappointment. I think many people compare this game to Dirt Rally 2.0 and are annoyed that it doesn't run on the Ego engine and has switched to Unreal Engine 4. And it's a valid criticism. The previous game ran and looked much nicer. That said, it didn't have licensed WRC content or extremely long stages. Others complain it doesn’t have as accurate physics as RBR. All of these games are good, with each having their own pros and cons. Personally I enjoy them all. In the end, WRC 23 offers a solid rally experience. For the 30 bucks I payed for this, I'd say it's worth it.

Tips for anybody having performance issues (Stutter fixed as of 1.5.1 patch)

1. Set car reflections to low. Anything higher hits the CPU hard and tanks FPS.

I use older cars from the early 2000's and 1990's and I just do just time trials as I have no interest in career modes or online gaming, I just like cool stages and handling for my own enjoyment.  The driving experience is very good, I like the handling. It is like DR 2 but better I think. It is hard to say how realistic as I am not a real rally driver so I have no basis to go off, but for a rally game/sim it provides what I think is a pretty realistic and good experience. 

The stages are nice also, many long stages like real rallying. 

Only downside is performance and graphics are poor at times, but I am ok with the graphics as I still play RBR. On low settings I get good enough performance but the occasional lagging which can be a hassle (lagging when I hit a bump and I am desperately trying to regain control of the car is simply just bad manners). This is subject to change though, as updates will improve things. Some of the RBR tracks graphics match the graphics here which is not cool, but they are usable and decent. Just I think for the performance issues on poor graphics is an area the developers could do with working on in my opinion. I turned the brightness down on HDR and this helped to make the contrast look better and less washed out. 

Their are not many great rally games/sims to choose from unlike track racing sims, but this is one of the better ones. Best Official Rally Championship game, Codemasters are probably the best developer for rally games. I like to think of it as a extension to DR2, more stages etc etc. Defiantly worth getting, even with the issues outlines above.

I am really disappointed and I hope devs will adress these issues as soon as possible, meantime I will go back to Dirt Rally 2.0 which is wastly superior to this game right now, hell even older Dirt Rally is more worth than this joke made on Unreal Engine 4.

Please devs, do something so I can change this review in a future and recommend this game, right now its not worth it even for free, saddest part is that I have more than 2 hours now so I cannot refund this game anymore.
(updated review):
So after few game updates which stated they further optimized the game and added lots of fixes to reduce stuttering all I can say is that none of it is true, game still have low fps in certain parts of some stages and there is literally no difference in the amount of stutter but after releasing 1.4 patch they also managed to introduce random crashes which I never experienced in previous versions. 

So I finally come to terms with this game and realized that chances to fix it are unreal, just like the engine it was made on. 

(extra update): 
Well, after three another patches which the latest one 1.5.1 is a major one I can say that nothing changed in regards of stutters and the Monte Carlo stage crashes still remain after being introduced in 1.4 patch.
If you want to waste money for a rally game published by EA who forced developers to switch to Unreal Engine 4 and then just never want to play that game and switch back to Dirt Rally 2.0 which is made on in house EGO engine of developers then this game is just for you.

It's a good arcade rally but going as far to say it's a simulation is a lie, cars feel overall very floaty with little or no weight behind them and there doesn't feel like there's much nuance in the handling, hard gravel feels the same as light gravel feels the same as dirt. 

Grip on Tarmac is very hit and miss, some times you can throw a car around a long corner at full throttle and not lose grip, other times the car will 'let go' for no apparent reason spinning you off the course and into the trees. 

On the topic of courses, the amount of rallies are impressive but the stages within them feel too similar. There may be 12 stages per rally but really this is just one or two long stages chopped up or reversed and this is glaringly apparent in career where you'll find yourself running the same courses over and over. The courses themselves are OK, but are a lot less visually interesting and less technically challenging than previous titles, you can tell someone got bored and just copy-pasted a bunch of trees on the side of most courses.

Graphically the game is alright, the only thing I have to complain about on that front is that nights are not dark enough, most courses you can drive at night with the headlights off. Rain and snow effects are also very lacklustre, nothing looks 'wet'.

As for the game itself I would say it's shaping up to become a huge improvement over Dirt Rally 2.0 in all aspects. Even graphics, the graphics do look better in this game, although not that noticeable. Everything else is a huge upgrade, from sound to stage design/length.

Though a bit more ""arcadey"" feeling than Dirt 2 (honestly what do I know having never driven a real rally car), the physics and weight transfer of the decades spanning selection of cars feels good and I can chain together a nice series of crowd awing drifts. 

I partially agree with other reviews about there not being too much difference between the categories especially FWD vs. RWD.

This basically breaks the game for me since 50-60fps is terrible on a racing game and ultimately, EA WRC looks no better than Dirt Rally 2.0 where I get over 100fps, so what is even the point?

The road texture problem is with night races where I get this black sparkle coming off the road due to the game poorly rendering the shadows of the 3D ""gravel"" areas. I got it to look a bit better by turning up anisotropic filtering and turning anti aliasing off, but really, this shouldn't be a problem in a RACING GAME.

Finally, there is loads of pop-in. Worse than Dirt Rally 2.0 and despite hours of trying to fix it (and get decent FPS out of the game) I gave up.

So maybe these issues will be fixed in the future. But all the good new parts of this game, better asphalt handling, longer stages, interesting new career mode and car builder are moot points. I REALLY hope this will just be a one-off mistake from Codemasters and not what all their new games will be like",1707105581,1707105581,False,3,0,0.509167194366455078,0,True,False,False

Despite what people say, I think the handling is much improved from dirt 2.0. Snow banks cause the tyres to bog down. Tarmac is much better, and the new gen WRC cars feel so fast on them.

The game has all the content needed to be a great rally game. dozens, if not hundreds of cars spanning back 7 decades can be found, each one unique in it's own style.

However, I cannot recommend the game because of the graphical problems I have. It has gotten better with patches, but unless you have a cutting edge PC, this game looks like trash.

Even on medium/high settings, I still experience stutters and visual glitches. When the game runs smoothly, it looks amazing. Sadly it never runs smoothly for me.

The co driver calls are downgrade from dirt 2.0 as well. The voice feels robotic and even on the earliest setting sometimes the driver will call too late.

Another problem is the game likes to hard reset the car too easily. If I go flying off a cliff at 60 mph, let me finish crashing. I want to be punished for my mistake, even maybe with a terminal dnf.

It kills your immersion when you are driving through a stage and it lags or the visuals bug out, then you crash because of it but the game doesn't even give you the satisfaction of a proper crash, but resets you to track like mario kart.

I was getting back into rally sim recently and playing Dirt Rally 2.0. I decided to give WRC a shot, despite some of the reviews, and I'm honestly surprised at the results. 

In the bit I've played so far I love the driving mechanics, the feel of the tracks, and the calendar. The career mode looks promising, creating a driver and livery is pretty cool, and the clubs work very well. I have a mixed setup between a G29 wheel and Fanatec Clubsport pedals, which work without issue. 

EDIT (negative): In Dirt Rally 2.0 I usually drove the BMW E30 as my ""main"" vehicle, which I drove just before purchasing WRC. I drove the E30 in WRC and I do NOT enjoy it. The snap oversteer on RWD cars and some AWD cars is unbearable and I'm unable to tune it out. You can't flutter the accelerator through turns to keep a slide as you can with real cars. It just will snap out from underneath you and ruin your stage. It must be an error that needs to be fixed. There are some tuning guides to fix this, but the tuning is so drastic it negatively affects other aspects of the vehicle's handling.

The stuttering is bearable with all settings on medium, but it becomes unbearable with settings on high. I have a decent machine that runs ACC on high/very high and Dirt Rally 2.0 on max settings without issue. They need to fix this, which is a main complaint of many, or they will lose a lot of interest in the game. 

One of the noticeable issues is the window reflections. I have mine set to very low, which helps with the stutter. The issue is, when you start a new stage there will be a flickering bright reflection on your windscreen. You have to go into settings, set it to low, un-pause, then go back in and set it to very low again to fix it. This has to be done every stage and is very annoying. 

The AWD cars in career have been fun, but that is about it. I'm growing tired of the stuttering and snap oversteer issues, especially after playing well put-together racing games like ACC and Dirt Rally 2.0.

I'm hopeful these issues will be fixed, but I have a feeling that since EA is in charge the patches/updates will be fewer and farther between. It doesn't really feel like the community is heard, which is an issue with big developers like EA. 

For the time being I'm going back to Dirt Rally 2.0 for my rally fix and I am changing my review to negative.

DRIVING

This is a less accurate simulation than the Forza Horizon 5 Rally DLC. I would say WRC 23 is about on par with off roading in GTAV. There is no discernible difference in handling between different FWD, AWD, and RWD vehicles. Every surface feels floaty and has far too much grip, especially on snow. This is especially frustrating on FWD and RWD vehicles, as the former is far too easy rotate without throttle while the latter is shockingly difficult to kick the rear out of, thus diluting the challenge that comes with these drivetrains.  This game seems to simulate looser surfaces by making the suspension mushy and the steering slightly less responsive . Different tire compounds seem to have the same effect on the vehicle, once again diluting the challenge. It also means on tarmac surfaces on soft tires you may as well be glued to the pavement.  Jumps, bumps, and rough road conditions have so little impact that often times I would not realize I caught air until I watched the replay. The co-driver calls are also very hit or miss, and while that is somewhat subjective, I have noticed a tenancy to call turns at a greater than 90 degree angle ""square"", and calling what is clearly an open hairpin ""square"" as well. 

GAME MODES

There are several game modes available to the player, but I found most to be fairly grating. To start, the Career mode is extremely frustrating. The game pushes you to ""design"" your own rally machine, only for all the options to essentially be cosmetic decisions from fictional manufacturers(excepting power plants, in some classes). Almost every upgrade blatantly states that it will not have any impact on performance, and even things like switching motors and exhaust have no effect on sound. Essentially, the only element of customization is that choosing more expensive parts will increase reliability, meaning that there is an objective best layout for mechanical parts. Horrible ""customization"" aside, once you actually begin the career mode you are essentially forced to race in everything but your shiny new custom machine, as in order to appease your sponsors you must compete in ""Hospitality"" events (essentially one-off events in a car that couldn't be further from whatever class you choose to campaign in) and multi week ""Championships"" (Like a hospitality event, but with more than one week of competition, and you have to come out of pocket to purchase a car to race in for this one event). Career mode also features a baffling crew stamina system. This system essentially prevents you from racing every week of the season as, especially in lower tiers, you are unable to afford (or often times even recruit at all) more than 2 or 3 crew members to maintain your car, meaning that repairs during events are extremely time consuming, if impossible. Perhaps even more frustrating is that your crew can become fatigued and eventually require 1 or more weeks of rest, which I cannot imagine is good form for professional racing mechanics. While I'm sure that some may enjoy a crew management aspect, that certainly should not be a concern of the driver. The one positive of this game mode is the chief engineer, who can often come off as annoying or even condescending, does seem to legitimately care for the driver.

Aside from the Career mode, there is also a time trial option, which is pretty much exactly what one would expect. Also available is a Championship mode, which is where I believe that the most fun is to be had. This mode sees you selecting a class and vehicle and participating in several events in the class. However, as if to spite me, you are forced to race in another driver's vehicle and, even more appalling, under ANOTHER DRIVER'S NAME. While some might not be bothered by this, I feel like it's an extremely needless and silly feature. Next up is Moments, which admittedly does provide for some level of interesting challenge as is allows you to experience some unique events in rally history, but once completed you're left waiting fore the devs to add more next season. There is also a ""Rally School"", which could be valuable for very new players (as in haven't driven a vehicle in any video game ever), but I found the lessons to be repetitive and much to slow. Finally, there is Quick Play, allowing you to jump into a random event, Clubs, which I haven't touched, Customization and Builder, allowing for custom liveries (which would be a welcome feature if not for having half the options locked behind a paid battle pass) and cars, respectively. Perhaps most annoying of all is the ""Rally Pass"", the aforementioned battle pass that has no meaningful reward beyond cosmetics you will not be looking at for the majority of gameplay.

AESTHETICS 

This game does not look very good. When I saw trailers I had hoped that we were being shown pre-release footage and the actual game would look better than an Xbox game from a decade ago, but sadly I was mistaken. While the cockpit is certainly passable, and the fans, drivers and marshals look a lot better than in DR2.0, the actual roads and surroundings look significantly worse, and the backgrounds and atmosphere are abhorrent. Especially jarring is rain and snow, as the former seemingly loops ""wetwindshield.gif"" directly into your helmet visor and the latter sees you harassed by thousands of invisible flash photographers. The haptic feedback on controllers is almost non-existent, and something just feels slightly off on a sim wheel, though this very well could be a settings issue on my end. Finally, the sounds in this title are extremely lackluster. While rally cars have tended to be low displacement 4 cylinder machines, that does not excuse how same-y the vehicles sound.

VARIETY

There is admittedly a very large variety of event locations and stages present in EA WRC, and slightly more vehicles as well when compared to DR2.0, though the complete lack of rallycross certainly stings. The increase in tarmac stages is especially welcome. That being said, having completed at least a few stages at every location (admittedly not a comprehensive test) most feel very similar, if not exactly the same, particularly between locations that share the same or similar surfaces. Also, apart from the ""different"" surfaces and backgrounds, the locations are very redundant in design. Gone are the fast, flat, straight roads in central Europe, the bouncy foothills of Scotland, or the verdant coastal cliffs in Oceania. Instead we are presented with a some variation of a windy mountain road which you will both climb and descend, perhaps more than once. Admittedly, there is some variety presented through the occasional maddeningly difficult technical section seeing you race through through tight colonial era roads between similarly aged buildings or around shockingly unguarded cliff side turns. While these short sections are certainly entertaining (sometimes), I found myself careening to a violent death off a cliff due to my co driver neglecting to tell me to ""keep in"" or ""don't cut"" when he really ought to or, even worse, following his advice to cut a corner keep left and running face first into an obstacle hidden around a blind turn. These bad call outs are compounded by the well documented Unreal Engine frame drops mid race.

FINAL THOUGHTS

As it sits, this game suffers a pretty big identity crisis, as it was marketed as a true rally sim and seemed to aim to pull in the larger Motorsports audience as well. The game is at best a sim-cade experience trying its best to wedge itself into the hardcore sim market. Unfortunately, there is simply better (and cheaper) alternatives for a rally sim, and better (and cheaper + a greater variety of content) competition in the sim-cade rally market. I will continue to play this game for maybe another 30 hours or so just to give it a fair shake.

Well, sad news. Still massive shader compilation stutters all over the place with no mention of any work for the last three months. Unfortunate, but I'm gonna say this game is a firm don't buy. Just stick with Dirt Rally 2.0 and save yourself the frustration.

-- Original review --

The essence of the game is solid, but the performance is just too distracting for a racing game at the moment. 120Hz is out of the question. I can't even lock 90fps on a 7950x and 4090 at high settings DLSS quality (CPU limited). The game really doesn't look dramatically better than Dirt Rally 2 or Dirt 4, but in those games I can get a flawless 120Hz on ultra settings with no image reconstruction. The cost/benefit of choosing Unreal 4 for this game is not panning out.

More seriously though, I've had to restart quite a few runs due to sharp stutters at very inopportune times. Despite claims of shader comp being worked on, I still see a large number of stutters when playing a stage for the first time. I also see huge stutters when the car, and I'm as confused about this as anyone, *bumps* something. Seriously. Bump a wall, scrape a rock, glance a tree, and you're going to get a massive stutter that all but ruins any chance you had to recover from the mistake. 

Still, I'm looking forward to changing this review to a thumbs up when the performance issues are cleaned up. There's a good racing game underneath the issues.",1701142401,1706844760,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Gameplay

The gameplay in EA Sports WRC is as realistic as it gets. You can control the car on a variety of surfaces, including snow, asphalt, and gravel. The physics are very realistic, and the cars feel great to drive. The game also features a variety of different rally cars, from the Group B era to the modern day.

Career Mode

The career mode in EA Sports WRC is a bit of a mixed bag. It's not the most intuitive mode, and it can be difficult to understand at first. However, once you get the hang of it, it's actually quite rewarding. You start off by choosing a team and a rally car, and then you compete in a series of rally events. As you win events, you earn money and experience, which you can use to upgrade your car and improve your team.

Performance

Some people have reported performance issues with EA Sports WRC, but I haven't experienced any problems myself. But I've also heard/read of people running the game on older or newer machines without any problems. It's possible that some of the performance issues are due to people having too much crap on their PCs. I would recommend clearing out some of your junk files or reinstall Windows 10/11 and making sure that you have enough RAM and storage space before you try to run the game.

Overall

EA Sports WRC is a great rally game that is sure to please fans of the genre. The gameplay is realistic, the career mode is challenging, and the graphics are stunning. I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a new rally game to play.

So here's the positive: There are TWO simple sliders for the controller and if you set the first one all the way to the right, and the second one all the way to the left, you'll have a perfect setup. In Rally 2, you could mess with the dozen settings forever and the car would refuse to steer quickly. I think they do it on purpose to make wheel rigs have an edge out of spite. Also, I think it's good for Rally to have some competition. 
Even with the recent updates, the stutters are jarring and basically ruins the game for me. I'm running a 4080 Super and 5800X3D and have tried many settings, but no matter what, at some point in a race it'll stutter and almost make you crash. I've also tried playing on an AMD 6950X with a 5800x and it's the exact same performance issues. 
As far as graphics go, it doesn't look that great. Just fix the stutters and it will be a fun game.

The stages, while a bit less detailed can get much longer. An acceptable compromise imo.
And there are a lot of locations!
The performance is a bit weak at the moment...

Things i think they need to improve:
* AI difficulty is all over the place
* (No longer the case, they added this now!) The game does not automatically switch to H-Pattern if you have a shifter connected and drive a manual car (dirt rally 2.0 could do that)
* Rally1 Hybrid class has some flaws in my opinion.
The energy recovery system is based on brake pedal position instead of applied brake pressure. so tuning your brake to be more powerful just hurts you because you dont regen as    often. The highest (70% throttle) trigger for the hybrid is way tooo low. the car barely moves at 70% throttle. They should either give a 90% option or make the gas pedal more linear.
* In career mode, engineers you dont take with you to an event dont recover automatically unless you decide not to do an event that week at all (cmon bruh)

while there are a lot of points to improve, i think they dont really affect the driving experience itself, i still love hunting times.

While the game has received multiple patches to address performance since my original review at launch, the supposedly added shader precaching/precompilation feature is still not functioning correctly. It does not seem to precache/precompile all of the shaders necessary to avoid stutter and hitches during gameplay.

Every time you update your graphics drivers — which automatically cleans out your shader cache — you'll experience major stuttering for the first few hours of gameplay. Eventually it becomes generally smooth (with the odd stutter here and there), but the next graphics driver update will put you back to square one.

This needs to be fixed with a proper shader precompilation feature, complete with some indication on the main menu that the process has completed.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

The game has the potential to be the best rally game ever, but the current technical issues hamper the fun.

Namely, the unoptimised use of Unreal Engine means intermittent traversal/loading stutters throughout various stages (some worse than others).  

Even more inexcusably, there is no dedicated shader precompilation step before gameplay, which means that shaders load in on the fly and cause additional stutter for the first few hours of gameplay (a process also reset each time new graphics drivers are installed). 

In a game that requires this much precision, micro hitches of even just a few milliseconds are enough to disrupt input and concentration. 

This should have been ironed out before release, rather than dumped on consumers with the ""release now and fix later"" strategy that is all too common in the industry now. 

I will amend my review to be positive once these issues have been rectified.",1698994368,1706271160,False,0,0,0.504950463771820068,0,True,False,False

The game is a nightmare to patch up and need to re download 60gb of data? It wasn't the 'patching' routine, it was actual downloading. 

Getting back on driving it last night, it was a bland and soulless experience on WRC2 cars in a Club. Still stuttered in crucial moments around monte carlo and it looked dated as a late Play Station 2 title. 

I cannot vibe to this... A huge mistake I made putting faith on the developers and passing the 2h mark.

It is sub par. Maybe I'll re visit later in the year and groove with it but now I cannot.


[h1] Old Review: [/h1]
No.

The game is marvelous to drive on but the AI will leave it with no substance. No game, no fun, no rally. Bugged, messy. *not even into the software performance yet*

[h1] AI: [/h1]

Since day 1 the AI drivers are bugging out mid event or after a couple of events in championship having you in front by MINUTES on a small to medium stage length. Imagine the 20+ km ones...
90%AI
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3087422427

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3087422357

Not damage related.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3087422311

When they work, they put a good fight. I was 7 Stages in a championship, 3rd stage at Mexico on WRC1 cars at 90% AI. First event was good, after the 2nd Stage in mexico I was down in 9th. 3rd Stage, the AI performance went down the hill and I was able to go 2 + min ahead of second and leading the event by more than 1 minute...

The point of a RALLY game is to drive on many different conditions being weather, road degradation and damage management. It is NOT a rally game to drive just on Time Trial, and having no AI do drive against absolute wrecks this title into the mud for me.

Funny that it needed much more than 2h to figure the problem out after testing and tweaking options in game while settling down.

The developers have already made 2 MAJOR patches in the game and this issue isn't fixed.

[h1] PERFORMANCE: [/h1]

I was not even talking about the stutters and why the GPUs are forced into max clock even when the fps is locked at 61 or vsync'd bellow 70% usage.... WHY???

The frame times are ALL over the place. Even without the shader compilation stutters, it is NEVER smooth. For a racing game, massive flat tire on that side...

...shader compilating mid.... race??? Who's bright idea was to code a game to let shaders compile mid race? Racing were objects are passing by your car less than 1 meter at 60+kph on a bumpy gravel road. A stuttering mess at every driver update because, guess what: the shaders are trashed after a new GPU driver installation and it will have it compile again.

Shader pre-compiler were introduced with minor benefits. I'd never think we would need to wait for major patches to get shaders pre-compilers. These things were something SOOO under the hood, we never had to worry about it 7 years ago. But now, it is something the developers: 'whoops, forgot. sorrey :|'

No, man... This is some new level of developing that's adjusting down peoples expectations of a working product.

This needed another 1 year to bake....but that's for ' EA SPORTS WRC 2024' or 'EA SPORTS WRC 2', right?

Will they advertise brand new shader compiler on its features as being something extra we need to celebrate to have???

Inexcusable. Codemasters new publisher has numbers on bank accounts even some whole countries would be envious of.

Licensing is part to blame. They needed the game out before the season ended in Japan. 

Rushed. Crumbling. Unfinished. Missing parts.

[h1] Design: [/h1]

The single player structure on this title is far better than any competition. This is among or the best racing game/simcade by its single player features alone. Seasons, custom championships, deep career team/resource management, deep livery editor in the likes of Milestone bike games (because it is on the same engine perhaps).

I was waiting for 1.3 patch to drop and expecting the AI to be fixed to give this a thumbs up by how much it brings to the table for rally games. A few days went by and the AI was solid, but today when I had some more free time, it went off rails....AGAIN.... Why I'd make a championship with these? 2+ minutes in front when I was 9th overall.... I was starting to actually play this, getting more focused, trying to mess with the setups and wait to fix my car at next service area, just for the competition to actually fall off a cliff.

[u] There is no point. [/u]

Other ridiculous bugs include:

-If you go to the main menu after a Clubs stage your car on that Club will be completely fixed/repaired of damage next time you hop into the Club again.

-Livery made by you will be displayed as full grey when you resume a Club progress after exiting to the menus or out of the game.

-30+ second penalty after missing a corner and going on its outside while 7 seconds penalty after throwing the car off some cliffs.


Time Trial is not a valid game mode either. There will be cheaters soon or they already are there on the top of leaderboard with minus impossible times like it was in DR2. I'm not talking about actual fast drivers. There were stages on DR2 completed in 5 seconds... they will be here. Not even mentioning it is always blinding eyes NOON. 

Stale, laboratory like, infinite retries, low level damage model. [h2] Not rally. [/h2] No thanks.

This wasn't meant to be DiRT Rally 3.0 either. It is missing the grittiness, the suspension physics are by FAR the most forgiving that ever was, the damage model is MUCH more difficult to terminal damage the car, although is easier to damage small parts by driving hard.

MAYBE the devs will fix the AI at the pace of consoles patching that needs WEEKS for them to be approved and released. From now, November, next patch will come mid December in the hopes of fixing the broken AI. That is not a guarantee either.

Maybe 2024?? ....or [h1] PRE-ORDER NOW [/h1] EA SPORTS WRC 2024 !!!

Bought this one for DiRT Rally (1) work this team have put out.

after getting the wheel settings right and graphics settings right it does look better graphically and have more FFB detail than dirt rally 2.0

It still runs badly. I don't drive for five minutes in a new championship and what has to happen happens. The game crashes and once again I find myself on the desktop sending a bug report! What am I actually sending these reports for?

Nobody is interested anyway. Thanks for nothing.
The game is still in a catastrophic state. For some it seems to run, which I personally don't care about, for me it doesn't run, and no it's not because of the RTX3080ti hardware and a Ryzen5950X should probably offer enough power.

I'm also one of the few who didn't like the fact that the license went to Codemasters EA from the start... I hope this goes back to KT Racing soon. They have understood how to put a rally simulation on the market. Without that sorry, unbearable voice of Lina van de Mars. Horrible!

The game has a great handling model, basically just being a DiRT Rally 3 but with official WRC branding. The stages can be super long and intense, and when you get into a groove and just zone out and execute on a tough stage, it feels incredible. If you liked DiRT Rally and its sequel, this is basically that but bigger and better.

Since they ditched the rallycross events from the DiRT Rally games, there are more full rally courses here, which is awesome. None of them are reused from the previous games either, so course here is completely new. The game also has seasons now, which can change the road conditions depending on when you drive a course (for example, Monte Carlo ices over in the winter, but is a dry high speed track during the summer).

You can also now play regular rally events online which are pretty fun, even though they mostly boil down to doing time trials vs your friends. You can also create your own rally car, which seems like kind of a shallow add-on, but is kind of fun to play around with for a bit.

The real big add on here (besides just having larger stages and more of them, and I guess newer cars) is the new single player campaign. This hugely expands on the previous game, where you would just enter a championship and do some races and be done. Now you manage a rally team, and you have budgets to stay within for expenses, you have to manage the stress levels of your engineers and stuff too. Each week you get to choose an activity to do, including entering rally races, taking rest weeks, going to auto shows, go to talent scouting events, etc etc. The biggest flaw that I can find in this mode is just that it's too easy. I have it on hard or ""Restrictive"" mode but it's still too easy to keep the sponsors happy, even if I'm DQing out of rallies and stuff the sponsors don't get upset with me. I'd really like to see more difficulty options so I can make the team management part harder, hopefully that's something they'll cook up.

Luckily though, the extra management mechanics are not very intrusive, and the majority of the game is still about the driving, so even if you don't care much about these things they shouldn't get in the way of the important part of the game, being the driving.

That being said, I did say it had a few issues that needed solved for it to really be the best. Here are the current problems:

1. Game still has stuttering and optimization issues even after the first patch. This could be fixed, but game just runs slow and stutters too much for how it looks. Like, the game looks good, but honestly not much better than DiRT Rally 2, yet I can't run it at ultra on a 7800XT and get 60 fps consistently. (your mileage may vary with the stuttering though, as when I first started playing I was on a GTX 1070 Ti running low settings, and I got basically no stutters. It could be tied to some of the higher visual settings, and I've noticed it stuttering less over time on the new graphics card, but performance could still be improved a LOT).

2. No VR Support. I'm not personally effected by this issue that much, but it's an odd exclusion considering the first two games had it, and this is seemingly built off of a lot of the same technology as those games. Not sure if they plan to add this in the future, but they'd be stupid not to.

3. The game looks good, but there are a good amount of scenarios where the colors just look washed out. Clear days in particular can be a bit too yellow on regular dirt stages for some reason, which is weird cause the footage in the trailers don't really look as bad as they do in game. There are a lot of scenarios where the game looks incredible though, and the assets here are all clearly of high quality. Maybe there will be good reshade mods for this game. This is a bit less of a game breaking issue but more of a weird jarring thing about.

Basically, if they optimize the game more and fix the stuttering, add back in VR support, mayybe add some difficulty options and iron out some other issues people are having, I really don't know what else they can do to improve the game. It's a blast just like its predecessors, but it just offers more. The greater variety in stages and the addition of the team management stuff really round the game out well, makes the single player feel more complete than in previous games.",1705815527,1705815527,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The force feedback that I get through my Fanatec CSL DD 5NM is great, I have my FFB all the way up and it's really nice for the cars that don't have power steering. The wheel actually vibrates on the grid when you're getting ready to launch,  which is a feature that for me is pretty rare to feel through a racing sim, especially in a rally sim. 

The story mode is more enjoyable than multiplayer at the moment, so if you're looking to get this game to only play multiplayer, I wouldn't recommend this game. 

The multiplayer is just poorly designed, finding a lobby isn't an issue, it's the wait timers that really kill the experience. There's a wait time to let the current rally finish before you get in, then there's another wait time for people to pick their cars, then theirs another wait time to let everyone ready up, then at the start of the rally you wait a little longer to let things sync up, and then finally you can rally. After the rally though there's yet another wait time to let the slower people finish or DNF. Then we wait again to hopefully rally again, but repeating all of those wait timers once again. 

Overall, the game is a great time on a Sim set up but only on story mode or the challenges mode, or the time attack sections, all really fun.

A game with next-gen hardware requirements and last-gen experience.
Plus stuttering, even if your hardware meets the specs.

However, the updated driving physics is better, compred to DR 2.0.
Apart from too much grip on wet, I found the driving model to be rewarding and credible. 
FFB on a wheel is spot on, much better than in DR 2.0. The feedback is stronger, more responsive and without annoying oscillation. With Thrustmaster TX I am happy with the default settings. 
However, the collision physics does not exist in the game. Most obstacles are either 100% rigid  (road signs) or 100% penetrable (bushes). No elastic collisions. No vegetation yielding like in DR 2.0... Am I the only guy hoping for this in a rally game?

As for the grahpics.
I apprieciate they aimed for less stylised and more raw, footage-like look. But tonemapping and color correction are terribly bad. Annoying yellowish filter on most stages makes my eyes bleed. Skintones look like in games from a decade ago (not super relevant for a rally game, but breaks another tiny bit of immersion anyway). Colors aside, distant vegetation at Monte Carlo stages reminds me assets from the original RBR...

GeForce Experience will not recognize the game so you get no help from that side of things to help you guess the correct settings for your computer.

It hurts to write a bad review about a rally game, which is one of my favourite genre, but this game is just a beta, and does not deserve a positive recommendation.

It was already full of bugs, and bad framedrops, when it released almost two months ago, which the developers of course couldn't resolve by now (I know it's hard to code, and EA pushed the release, but still...).
The graphics are pretty mediocre, with the AntiAliasing techniques implemented, it's either too aliased, or too blurry with bad ghosting. I miss the CMAA and MSAA options from DiRT Rally 2.0.
With the recent update even my career save got corrupted, and the game crashes, when I press on Continue.

The move from EGO to UE is a setback in every way, despite the fact that longer stages have been produced. In my opinion, graphics, physics, audio and peripheral use is way below Dirt Rally 1/2. The UE enginge struggles with the graphics (lots of transverse stutters) as well as the input if you are on wheel/clutch/stick shifter. Your inputs will not be recognized (switching gear for instance) and you end up trying to cope with the lag.

For the driving part, you do not need to position the car, rather just point it into the direction you want to go. That's where it becomes a mario cart game. The game seems to be designed to be fun using a thumbstick controller on the couch. And that is probably the target.

If you like driving cars, use RBR.
If you like video-games, enjoy WRC.

I hope to change my review over time if UE/CM actually can deliver with some patchwork and most importantly (for me) also include VR.

I bought WRC, played it for 1,8h and then bought Dirt Rally 2.0 GOTY out of curiosity to compare them to each other. After a few minutes messing around in races there was no doubt WRC is severly inferior and a significant downgrade to Dirt Rally 2.0.

Compared to Dirt Rally 2.0:

- damage model got extremly simplified
- arcade-like driving physique  
- you are floating on top of the track, not immersed in it
- unnatural lighting setting (UE5)
- background (trees on mountains, etc.) looks absolutely nauseating
-  trees still not moving (wind)
- plants like tiny cactus arms and small trees are rock solid, will fully stop your car at any speed when touched
-  track surfaces have abrupt texture changes with no transition or blending (grass-gravel) and look much too perfect
- ground doesn't tear up dirt and feels static
-  severe fps drops (on 7900XT)


In WRC some tracks are longer, have the original licence and the car cockpits are more crisp, but for a game which is 4,5yrs newer it's rather pathetic. This game got released too early and the last minute transition to Unreal Engine 5 didn't help either.

Buy Dirt Rally 2.0 GOTY on sale for 9,99€ instead, it's an absolute no-brainer.",1704668175,1705545620,False,118,7,0.785053074359893799,0,True,False,False

Career mode has a serious glitch right now that EA is aware of and has acknowledged, but they still haven't fixed it after more than a month. Absolutely embarrassing for a company as well-funded as EA to not fix a game-breaking bug on a release as new as this.

The driving feels good, but some of the cars are incredibly frustrating to drive as they handle super poorly and will understeer like crazy or oversteer and spin out at the slightest thing, without any chance to recover or stop the spin. This can range from just being frustrating to being infuriating, and I've rage quit a few challenges (excuse me, ""moments"") because of it

One of the other things that's frustrating is that the road signs and poles are treated like solid objects. With where some of them are placed, that's a terrible decision and one I hope gets changed because it's really frustrating to barely clip a sign and have it either spin you out, wreck your car, or stop you dead in you tracks and make you back up to go around it.

Another huge problem is EA's decision to try and force a FOMO battle pass system to the game. There's not much for liveries and driver customization in the game to start with, and instead of adding more like a normal developer or even just making it a DLC like most companies normally would, EA has decided to lock them behind their ""Rally Pass"" as they're calling it. This isn't Fortnite or Call of Duty, stop with the battle pass BS and just add the customization options. Or open them up to modding to people can make their own stuff.

The game also runs terribly. You'll get frame rate drops and stutters for no apparent reason and often at the worst possible times. It feels like this game needed a few more months in the oven but EA decided to force the release and hasn't spent the time to fix the problems. There are also tons of weird crashes that seem to have no rhyme or reason to them.

More forgiving than the Dirt Rally titles, but still is a lot of fun.

Pros:
-Default setups are pretty good for new players (Not E-sport ready)
-Tarmac feels amazing compared to Dirt Rally 2.0
-Long realistic stages, narrow roads
-Build your own race car
-Car sounds are spot on
-Career: Budget and staff management
-Rally school: I seen a lot of people having zero idea what left foot braking is or how/where to apply it, it's really cool that there are lessons that teach new drivers these techniques


Cons:
-A.I is really weak even on the highest difficulty
-Multiplayer mode is weird

But...there's a distinct lack of polish.  Things like me taking over a WRC2 car with my custom driver only to have the old drivers name pop up half the time.  Things like the tyres, on replays, looking like they aren't entirely connected to the surface.  Things like your co-driver sounding like a bored voice actor rather than an actual rally co-driver (I miss the guy from Dirt 2).

- grafically, the game is very underwhelming - everything seems flat and washed out ... the game seems quite dated compared to the WRC Generations or DR2. I think it looks comparable to RBR with some custom shaders. 
- the famous shader stutter - not that noticeable, but it is still there. It is quite annoying if you're going for a corner and the picture stutters, throwing you off rhytm.
- I miss the challenges from previous WRC games
- handling of the car - something feels different. While in other games I usually have problems with understeer, in this game the car feels very pointy, almost too willing to go sideways.

What's really awesome is the sound design - you can hear the gearbox whining, changes of the sound when the doors fall off, ...
I also appreciate the Rally school (which is very reminiscent of the rally school in the RBR, even though the Scandi flick bit is missing).

As I wrote in the beginning, I have a bit mixed feelings a bit. I think I'll give it a chance, hoping future updates will improve the graphics.

EDIT:
-----
Updating to Thumbs Up. 
Not sure if I just gotten used to it or there were updates to the driving model, but the cars seem to be much more manageable, sometimes I still go sideways quite unexpectedly though.
Graphicswise, I almost get no shader stutter, but the game still looks a bit bland, could use some boot in saturation and contrast, and the snow and rainfall effects still look awfull.

Keep in mind I also bought this game about a month after initial release, so I can't comment on people's initial experiences from the day it released, as they could have updated it since.

1. ""Game runs like garbage""
When I first ran the game, I did find that it ran sub-standard. Running Nvidia DLSS or the AMD equivalent is a must, and I find that the default settings don't optimise the performance you could be getting, and in some cases make the game actually look worse. If you put a small amount of experimentation into the settings that work best for you, you can completely eliminate any stuttering, performance issues, and visual artifacts whatsoever. I'm running a 2080 at near max graphics, and I find it seriously hard to believe that people running 4090's are having the performance issues they're describing.

2. ""Game looks like garbage""
You could say that for a game released in 2023, it could have looked better overall, but it is by far better than DR2.0. I really don't understand how people can say this game looks worse than the previous Dirt games. I mean, it just doesn't. I can't really comment any further on the visual style. I personally think that the graphics are fine, looks immersive, by far better than any other Rally game in the past.

3. ""Buggy""
In my total 62 hours played, I am yet to encounter a bug. This could be different for other people, but again, that's my experience.

4. ""Bad physics""
When I first played this, I also thought that the physics were a bit dodgy, and the cars had way too much grip for it to be a 'realistic' Rally sim. Since then however, the understeering issues seem to have been silently fixed? I genuinely don't know what happened but the Physics feel great now. I remember initially playing on asphalt in the rain and I described the car ""gripping like a formula one car"". It doesn't seem to do this anymore and you can easily tell the difference in grip between dry and wet asphalt. I don't know if there was some silent update by Codemasters, but I honestly think the physics are great now.

What do I like about the game?
1. I think that it is an improvement over previous titles.
2. Asphalt physics are massively improved, as well as gravel physics.
3. Car setup customisation is relatively in-depth and set-up changes do effect the cars handling.
4. Force feedback feels very direct and responsive.
5. Livery customisation is good overall for its simplicity, if lacking in certain areas of complexity.
6. Stages are magnificent, they have such complexity, length, and depth, narrowness, surface type, scenery, and more. They really are the best I've ever seen.
7. Game is very immersive, it's hard not to get stuck into playing a season of this trying to fight to win.

What do I dislike about the game?
1. EA's monetisation, whilst not bad yet, I can see getting there if it gets out of control.
2. AI is incredibly inconsistent. One stage I'll be running somewhere in the middle of the pack, next stage I'll have somehow beaten everyone by a whole minute, winning me the Rally outright. This alone makes the competition in it a bit more boring. I don't see how this is happening to be honest, they got it right in previous titles.

Personally though, I just find that most of the issues people are having with it just don't exist.

Overall the game is fantastic, and you can tell the game has been made by enthusiasts to cater to both hardcore and beginner Rally fans, it has great depth in the variation of cars, rallies and stages that no other Rally game has been able to achieve thus far. I hear people in the reviews praising RBR, but RBR cannot cater towards the beginner audience. This has managed to achieve both, with the assist options and the choice to have simplified pace notes. For those who say this is an ""arcade experience"" I'd recommend you play a whole career or season with restarts turned off, hardcore damage, and the hardest AI difficulty. This game can be catered to the hardcore audience if you want it to be.

There are some really apparent performance issues, such as screen tearing, microstutter and the occasional frame drop. I have quite an old PC (GTX 1080, 16GB RAM, i7-6700 CPU, game installed on HDD), but overall the performance issues are not obstructive/prohibitive for me. That being said, I do hope that Codemasters/EA will fix these issues soon. It is extremely annoying to go into a high speed corner, get a frame drop and end up in a ditch as a result. 

Another point, VR support was promised after launch, but as of yet there is none. I hope they add that soon as well.

I'd say the graphics are mixed - sometimes really nice, but at points also poor looking, painfully obvious tiling, lots of pop in close and far, floating trees, poor tree models, poor public models and animations.. and then at some spots it just looks really good all of a sudden, but not consistent at all. 

Performance is still unstable at this point, framerates drop and there is constant microstuttering, like every 20 or 30 seconds a small glitch on some stages. I sort of got used to it, and then I went back to Dirt 2.0 and that just felt so buttery smooth in comparison and it was such a relief...

Feeling of the cars on the surface is nice with a ffb wheel.
Great variety of tracks and cars, although i'd rather have a bit less and higher quality...

The constant loading and transition screens in the menus are also a big pain in the ass, it feels like after every choice you make you have to wait for something to load and then find where to click next to advance to where you want to be.. it's just a pain to deal with and get the the racing part of the game, painful. Like when you try to start a 'moment', basically a single stage.. first it asks you if you want to enter since you have another 'moment' in progress (not actually sure what that changes but ok..), then i loads, then it gives you some view of the track, then you continue, it loads again, it gives you the garage view, you press start, it loads again, it gives you a view of your crew inside the car, then after some seconds it puts you in the car, and then finally when you hit the handbrake it starts the countdown... what a pain in the butt.

So yeah, I wish they'd fix the menu structure to make it feel less frustrating to navigate, and the performance also still kinda sucks, mainly with the stuttering. If they pull everything together over the coming months I'll be happy, but I heard they fired the original Codemasters crew after forcing them to put the game out early/unfinished, so I don't have high hopes and and at this point sort of regretting sponsoring this EA company.. better play dirt 2.0 over this.

the cars feel better where weight is concerned so kudos. The ai at 100 percent is where you will find some challenge, but when you try long career  it just seems kind of boring because the colors sort of blend too much .
i gave it thumbs down because i feel like is just dirt 2.0 with some re work or like i just drove on the wrc 10 which felt too similar, really need to make a solid simulator for rally and start laser scanning rally stages. i still drive it because in my opinion is much better anyway just mind your expectations.

Sound:
Nice. On most cars. Sometimes they didn't seem to care or didn't have the time to do so and the car sounds like more gearbox than engine, like the 2001 WRX.
Gameplay:
Handling feels actually really nice to me. Tarmac is a bitch twitchy on controller, but its not too bad.
The Stages are nice, unless you care about properly set collisions/limits.
Many bushes are immovable objects. Those which aren't act more like a force field that's turned up too much, and I begin think they actually are behind the scenes. Tiny rock protrusions have sent me flying a couple times now even if I just grazed them with my front bumper. Signs, Fences and such are also immovable objects. Basically there are either people, force fields or death waiting for you off track. Corner markers are wildly inconsistent with the actual limits. Sometimes you can take em out no problem and other times one wheel outside is enough to get you a penalty.

As an avid gamer with nearly 1000 hours logged in the Dirt Rally games (and a national champion in Dirt Rally 2.0), I embarked on a new journey with WRC EA Sports with high expectations. I appreciate the driving mechanics in this game which are both intuitive and enjoyable, particularly when handling the more powerful and rear-wheel-drive cars. This is an aspect of the game that truly shines for me.

[h2]Experiencing the game[/h2]
Regrettably, the user interface falls short - on PC with keyboard and mouse. The card view layout is not only inefficient but also lacks the necessary clarity and data for effective comparison of items.

Tracking progress in championships is a challenge, and the teammate credits system is confusing in the early stages of the game. You earn credits intended for recruiting a teammate, but this option isn’t available in the initial seasons. This isn’t clearly communicated to the player, who is only directed to the Talent Scout, where only engineers are available.

On a positive note, I appreciate the option to participate in multiple championships and the flexibility to choose a different class for a change of pace during the ongoing main championship. The feature of selecting events in a week is a good addition, despite being affected by some of the other issues I’ve described in my review.

My excitement for advancing through the WRC classes was quickly dampened when a bug in the Benefactor Target - FWD Extreme Championship - failed to count my points, preventing me from progressing to the next class. This was a major disappointment and calls into question the game’s testing process.

Running the game on 7800X3D and 7900XTX, the performance is generally good and looks ok at 3440×1440 with around 180fps, depending on the stage. However, any collision with a fence, wall, or bush causes significant stutters, which is particularly problematic during crucial correction moments. The rain and snow effects are sometimes subpar, especially when compared to the impressive rain effects in DriveClub from nine years ago.

[h2]Value for Money[/h2]
I initially purchased the game at a discounted price of 45€, thanks to owning previous Dirt games. However, the recent sale reducing the price to 30€ felt somewhat disheartening, despite it being a necessary move for the game. However, at the original price of 50€, I find it challenging to recommend. If you are not in a hurry, I think you should wait a little bit more, for the game to reach the polished state it should have been at release or wait for another sale.

[h2]Conclusion[/h2]
I have yet to explore the Moments and Clubs features of the game. However, I don’t anticipate that these aspects will significantly alter my current perspective. Should my experience improve or change in the future, I will certainly revisit and update this review accordingly.

WRC EA Sports offers an enjoyable driving experience but falls short in terms of user interface, career mode, and performance. I hope future updates will address these issues and elevate the game to the level it has the potential to reach.",1704414813,1704415093,False,3,0,0.518460929393768311,0,True,False,False

1. LAG - especially Mexico (very frustrating to play), Monte Carlo (the game freezes on the first stage, I had to find a solution myself on the internet, also huge lag) and Japan. I have a 3080 video card and an i5 13600 processor by the way. After the game update, the problem was not solved, rather it got a little worse. I have tried to find solutions on my own, so far to no success.

In other rallies, lag spikes occur from time to time, and the FPS drops significantly lower than using headlights on cars (I have given them up because of this, I drive in the dark).

2. Some tiny trees and shrubs are as strong as thick concrete posts.

3. The AI is very broken at times. I have the Al strength set to 90%. Some stages require perfect driving to compete for first place, other stages I beat the AI by 3 minutes.

Overall, it's fun to drive. The career gets a bit boring over time (I've finished 3 seasons so far).

Lag is the biggest headache so far. If the lag problem is solved I can give a positive review.


EDIT (One and a half moths later):


The game is completely broken (Patch 1.4.0).

1. Career mode is 100% crash (Unless you start a new career)
2. Even if you restart your career, rallying is pointless because the AI is STILL broken (some races are very close, some I win in 2.5 minutes). It's been broken since the release of the game btw.

Whilst the gameplay elements are all excellent, the core driving physics, tire simulation and resulting force feedback leave much to be desired, especially on asphalt.

The game is very enjoyable to play through, even with a wheel, as long as no tarmac stages are considered. The inherent extreme slip angles on gravel and snow result in a great suspension of disbelief - and the excellent presentation helps with this. But it just all breaks down on tarmac, where anybody who has driven at any speed in any car will instinctively feel that something weird is up. I can just summarize it as DiRT 4/DiRT Rally 2 physics, but with just more fake grip on tarmac, instead of properly modeled wheels with their respective things like how traction changes through varying slip angles and how that translates in the car actually being able to steer and put power on the ground.

The resulting force feedback on tarmac is disappointing at best, and completely the opposite of a realistic expectation at worst. Cars such as the F2 Kit Cars do not at all behave like their actual counterparts, something which DiRT Rally managed to represent so well.

If you do not play this game with a wheel though, or just aren't very critical of the arcade-ish handling, it's still a good game. Just not a good simulator.

I have tried everything. I know about verifying games files. I have already re-downloaded the whole game. It's BROKEN BROKEN BROKEN. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNTIL IT IS FIXED! Every time I sit down to play I can't get 2 stages in without the game crashing. Lowest graphics settings have no effect. Using different controllers no effect. I am rescinding my approval of this game until it gets fixed. There are people with lesser systems than myself and people with greater systems who ALL report the same BS ""corrupt or missing files"" error. No one has corrupted their files, this is NOT user error.

EA, you have the budget to fix this, so do it. Stop band aiding stuff. Fix the game.

After just under 300 hours I am happy to say that this is an improvement over Dirt Rally 2.0, and certainly worlds better than the former Developers take on the WRC rally. I have been with Codemasters as a fan since the first Colin McRae rally back in the 90s. It's debatable that there have been better and worse versions of the game over the years. I have found them all enjoyable in their own ways.

This time around, with the backing of mega publisher EA, a focus on true simulation level WRC realism is here. They have finally bested the Dirt Rally original, and Dirt Rally 2.0 versions of the game. I am happy to recommend this title to our friends and students.

It has some problems, but they are working hard to improve it.
The first 2 weeks were awful, but that's market standard these days isn't it? lol
Most of the common complaints about stability can be temporarily addressed through a few key graphics adjustments. Our Rally Community can help you with all of that. 
We had 32 players in a cross platform lobby for the last couple weeks now with occasional but reasonable connection issues. Usually just failure to connect, reconnect and it's fine.

Don't use vsync, apparently Unreal doesn't like it. use frame limiting if needed.
Turn off mirrors and other extraneous options, I generally work from the Medium or High presets.
I have had a few crashes based on custom liveries, so I am staying away from those for now.
Do not use a USB hub, if you need additional slots use a PCi Usb card. It's not the power it's the data bottle neck.
Some have recommended using m.2 SSD, but I find standard SSD sufficient for now. Although I'm sure loading could be even better.

I run a pretty modest PC:
i7-6700k
rtx 2060 11gb GFX
32GB DDR4 Ram
Samsung SSDs
Thrustmaster peripherals
While streaming in 1080P with 3 Cameras, and using the game in nvidia surround mode to run my Triple 60hz monitors.

Sim Hub makes my game crash for now. 

I will update this review as my experience in this game evolves.

Feel free to contact me, or join our Discords if you need more help.

It has A LOT better physics than Dirt Rally 2, especially on tarmac, which makes me not want to play Dirt 2 anymore. There's also a lot more locations (and I hope more are coming in the future because how can you have a rally game without Scotland or Wales, cmon boys), some new cars but also some are missing, not sure why my beloved Datsun is not there, and the tracks are a lot longer and service times are put in much more interesting points; makes the game have that survival vibe when there's 50km before a service station and your radioator is bashed up. This all is great, this is core gameplay after all and they did that well.

What is not great, and really tilts me enough to give a negative review is how everything else is shit. I will start with the least negative thing--the carreer. It's fine, I feel like it's a little overcomplicated and you get a lot of choice how to do that mode, but then your ""benefactor"" wants you to play a certain way so it's a bit annoying, let me play how I want. I also think it's overcomplicated, like many things in this game. I get that you want managing your crew to be a part of the game, but do they really need stamina bars, it's just a part of game I wish I didn't have to care about. Then all the menus follow the big trend of AAA games--horizontal nightmare. Like seriously, Rally 2 had such a good and simple UI, and here tuning your vehicle is divided by submenus with way too large of icons for no reason, tyres are yet another separate thing, I just feel lost in these, and it makes want to not interact with it. ""Championship"" mode only lets you plat WRC, WRC2 and WRC Junior, nothing else, why? Like really why? What's the point of limiting that? Multiplayer is hit and miss too. For some unthinkable reason you need to scan a QR code or go search up racenet in your browser, outside of the game (and without scanning the QR code it's not blatantly obvious to go to racenet) and then join a club. There are 2 official clubs, WRC and Historical Rally, and they are fun. I'm having a great time with those. But then if you want to join more clubs you now how to go on the Internet and somehow find a club that interests you because you can't just browse them like in a normal game/website. So not only do you have to go out of your way to even get a decent multiplater experience, but also why in the fuck is it not as easy as in Dirt 2? A bunch of monthly, weekly, daily challenges without searching up clubs so that you can take part in a championship... The best thing is that the racenet site doesn't really have any advantages. It gives you nothing but the option to join a club and look at some stats, that honestly barely make any sense. Wanna see how well you performed in this one club? Well you cna only check how you performed on the very specific stage IN GENERAL. What's the point of that? The graphics? Honestly... kinda bad. They do the job but why is it worse than Dirt 2 with like 60 less fps? I haven't really gotte these famous stutters but the performance is badish.

Now onto the racing itself... The AI is non existent. I heard it's bad so I set it up to a 100, took an RWD H2 car (so something I am pretty bad at), aaaaaand... I got 1.5 minutes on the 2nd driver in a stage where I spun out 3 times, got an 18s penalty, and my engine was losing a lot of power for half of the stage. I also apparently were quicker than the freaking Porsche from the RWD B Group. You're basically alone in these championships, you cannot lose, I am not a good rally driver, I should not be getting this much time on a 100 difficulty. For comparison, I played Dirt 2 on 90 difficulty and I would usually average maybe 8th place; I'd be sometimes 15s behind where I knew I really could not have driven faster. And the pacenotes... OMG they are so shit. And Dirt 2 did not have the greatest ones either but they were fine enough. ""slowing"" call is EXTREMELY inconsistent, sometimes you don't need to slow down, sometimes you REALLY do, ""breaking"" seems to always be a lie, there's nothing like ""rocks inside"" call so you drive at the edge of the road and suddently you die because there is a rock in a bush (which I also feel is intentional). Some calls come way too early, some calls come way too late, some calls go like ""slight left, slight right, square left"" and so I anticipate some turns before the square left, but no, it's a straight road and now I'm too late to brake, but it doesn't matter because I'm 1st anyway. There's also the same tone for easy parts and technical parts which is annoying; Dirt 2 KINDA had some firmer tone for harder parts but not rly, and this one just has nothing of the sorts. Also I haven't heard ""bad camber"" call at all. I still don't understand why nobody thought to let you drive through the stage, and actually make your own pacenotes, you know, like the real drivers do, I'd love that so much. Or even give us like an editor where you can alter the pre-made ones.

All in all if we take raw gameplay then it's a great game I'd give it maybe 9/10. If we take user experience then I'd give it 2/10, so if we make an average out of that it's 5.5/10 and this is how I feel about this game. It can be so much better, the multiplayer could be so much more fun, the career could be so much more interesting if the AI wasn't utter trash, the pacenotes... well you can work with them but they also could be so much better.

This game should be marked as Early Access and thankfully the price reflects that.

EA obviously knew prior to releasing the game that they we're behind on development but that didn't stop them from promoting this as a finished product.

Everything else is C Tier at best. 

 Graphically though, things are underwhelming (especially with how poorly things run). 

Physics are strange.. but fun; they nailed the feel of a simcade. Codies does gravel well and tarmac (still) not so well. So this is a natural successor to the Dirt Rally Series.

with my MSI RTX3060ti on PC.
My Fanatec CSL DD 8Nm wheel/shifter/handbrake also works great
This new game looks and feels good, and finally the physics and damaged are very good.
Time trial is the most forgiving to explore the cars and stages with a light damage available that you cannot control.
On championship/club/quick play you can place the damage on real/hard...and it is correct, well developed.

There are 2 points that are missing from this WRC edition, 
the more varied stages of WRCgeneration, especially Croation, but fortunately the other stages are better than DR2. 
Even though these are real stages, I prefer the self-made stages as in WRCgeneration. 
Fortunately, countries such as Monte Carlo, Estonia, CER, Chile... also have really nice, challenging stages.

The lower power of the GrB cars compared to DR2 can also be heard and felt, especially at higher revs compared to DR2.
In contrast, the WRC rally1 cars are the most complete. 
Beautiful sound, wide power band and very good feeling to drive it...addictive.
All other classes are by far comparable to DR2 
with a nice addition of the S1600 and S2000 cars which were also very well made.

Ultimately, I like this first edition of EA WRC. 
Although you can see that this game was actually based on being released as DR3, in the end they still made the necessary adjustments to WRC... especially the layout and rally1 cars.

At the end if you get used to this game and know how to find the limits, you will really have a lot of rally feeling/fun

Performance is terrible. Stutters, at random places, you need to complete the map you're playing so that SOME stutters no longer happen when you restart. On longer maps, fps just keeps dropping the further you progress (probably some memory leaks).

Very happy with this game so far, really fun, great leveldesign, great physics and good feel on the controller with lots of rumble feedback and then camerashake and all other stuff happening, it gets chaotic and stressful at times. I can't speak for wheel players but I can imagine it would be even better. Great selection of tracks as well and they are really fun to drive on.

The only negative I have is that graphics should be even better in 2023 and definitely not be demanding when they look like they do. Not much stutters and such that other people mentioned, I have had 3-4 but now when I played a bit I have had none.

Game looks great

Proper career mode is a plus

Cars actually feel like cars and not rc toys (weight-wise, handling is a whole different story)

Now on to the bad:
The game stutters horrendously on all but the lowest settings even on 1080p (Can play Dirt 2 in vr on ultra w/o stutters) which is not really surprising considering the malware known as Denuvo is baked in.

The default setups for the cars are completely noncompetitive, I'm pretty sure a stock Yaris could set a better time than the WRC version with the included default setup, so be prepared to spend half an hour minimum tuning every time you want to try a different car.

You can't control when hybrid activates and if you even touch the throttle for a millisecond while your hybrid bar is full it activates and drains the entire hybrid system even when just blipping the throttle to get the car to rotate in a corner.

The announcer/commentator is overly obnoxious 

Pacenotes are either late or just plain wrong way too often

No VR support at the time of this review

Final thoughts:
Stick to Dirt 2 for now. This is not a Codemasters game, it's yet another unfinished rush job being falsely advertised as a finished game as EA tends to do. EA has yet again taken a reputable and respected studio and absolutely crapped all over their name by forcing them to rush out an unfinished mess and then laying off portions of the team before they could even attempt to fix the game.
I sincerely wanted this game to be good, I've put so many hours into Dirt Rally and Dirt 2 and was looking forward to a refresh of the rally game genre, I should've known better with EA involved. For me, with the release of this title, the WRC franchise is dead until a decent publisher acquires the rights to the franchise.

My initial thoughts were that it still feels like an unfinished game, the engine sounds were uneven (the 6R4 sounds great, the Evo X does not, for example), I had the odd framerate stutter but perhaps worse than that was even with all the graphics settings set to ultra it looked a lot like WRC 9 in terms of quality. Compare Monte Carlo in this to Dirt Rally 2.0 and the latter looks so much more realistic.

The physics are OK and something I could get use to I think, the front end doesn't feel as connected as in DR 2.0 but it does at least feel better than the older WRC games.

I have requested (and received) and refund for EA WRC, prior to its release I was SO excited that finally a modern rally game was going to surpass DR 2.0 but it feels a bit worse in the areas that matter (apart from the stages) so it seemed pointless having this in my library. I'm not sure I can see a redemption arc for this game for me, proper triple screen support and a big overhaul of the graphics and sound would help along with physics refinement but unless it's significantly better than DR 2.0 I'd rather spend my money on more deserving software houses / publishers.",1704020938,1704020938,False,4,0,0.507672667503356934,0,True,False,False

For someone whos first game was Dirt Rally 4 and Dirt Showdown I took a hiatus from Dirt games for a long time until I played Dirt Rally 2.0 which is wear I really learned rally racing.

This game is a good successor for it sure its not a 10/10 and it doesnt have rallycross but for EA trying their first attempt at a rally racing game this is actually very good.

Game has its bugs yes but it gets better with each patch and update. People will also say the graphics are bad but I have no idea what they are on about I play on ultra graphics and the game is beautiful and has more damage detail. Some will say that some routes are empty which is true most dont have buildings and some of the bushes look like shit I will agree but when youre playing on 97 difficulty and going constantly 80+ mph in the snow you really dont notice anything else other than trying not to crash lmao. the snow effects could be better but I am happy the snow routes are not locked behind a paywall like Rally 2.0 was. thankfully you have alot more access to more routes than rally 2.0 gave you when getting the base game and career mode is what I wanted in a rally game for a while and it has teammates which is fire. Multiplayer scoring system is a bit buggy but they said it will be fixed and nonetheless 32 player lobbies are fun.

If you dont have a well enough pc than I would suggest getting it on console. if you want it for VR which is promised I would wait as its being worked on and there needs to be more bug patches first.

First was to change to ""not recommended"" after having played the game for well over 100 hours. This edit is to organise the text into a less messy rant and make it, hopefully, a bit more of a coherent.

Positives:
For the most part I really enjoy the driving (lets not talk about the handbrake on FWD). The weight of the cars and their responsiveness feels great. Obviously this is subjective but I definitely think that on gravel it's a slight improvement over Dirt Rally 2.0's occasional hovercraft. However, the asphalt stages are now glue-like until spin (no in-between). Other folks seem to think it's good/preferable like that but I think I'd be happier with something between where we are now and what DR2.0 had.

Negatives:
UI is a bare-bones mess. Although it's almost EA standard fair these days it very much feels like it was built for mobile phones then shoved out of the door with no frills. There is a lack of information in almost every page. E.g
	- In career mode next to no information regarding each rally event is provided before signing up so you'll have no idea of weather/time of day/etc. Plus, if it's a multi-day event there is no way of knowing if it will clash with other competitions you may be signed up to.
	- Clubs page is another great example. If you've signed up to a lot (and you must as they are really the only part of the game that gives anything reasonably fun to do) you will have to click on each one individually to see if the next event is available. Plus as each is represented as a LARGE card it means scrolling through, clicking, waiting, returning to the main club page, remember which one you checked last, scroll through, click, wait, ad nauseum.

Career Mode: Completely pointless as opponent AI is all over the place. However, in it's current state it is presented as weeks in which you can only do one action. Rally this week? No looking for more engineers. Make the mistake of signing up to a few different championships and before long you'll have no time to rest engineers or go to events (to increase garage size/employee numbers/etc). Go to an car purchase event and find there is nothing there for you. Too bad. Week gone by. It's not even possible to get better details of a rally before entering. So if you are new rallying be prepared to have to exit the career mode fire up a quick time trial or something to test the car/location to see if it's something you'll like or just lose another week. And PLEASE let me turn off captain obvious. Discount Sean Beans' inane and repetitive comments with what sounds like a ""tut"" every time we get back to the main career screen (lol) is aggravating to say the least. 

Moments: Utter crap. Overly repetitive although they are allegedly hand created (maybe the nonsensical AI is responsible for these as well). Current trend is lots of Monte-Carlo in modern WRC. With a couple of older Subaru's on gravel thrown in. They also have no reason to be beyond being a means to earn points for damn liveries or avatar items. Banging on the DR2.0 drum a bit more the events earned actual credits that could be used to buy and maintain cars in your garage. This was the beginnings of a great idea that could have been expanded (allow people to compete in multiple Rallies up to the number of cars they had available). 

Graphics: Three patches in and the stuttering is still evident. My actual issue is half SECOND pauses at seemingly random parts of various stages. Sunny stages are overly washed out requiring brightness to be adjusted down (to about 20% in my case), while night stages are believable dark the headlights don't reach far enough. In-car view also suffers from glitches with reflections necessitating a switch from low to ultra low or visa-versa to fix. A simple OFF would have been nice. Dash view in some cars is WAY too low (literally 40% of the screen is the the grey dash! Let us adjust this or give more freedom in another of the in-car views)

Stages: One or two zombie spectators performing movements to a beat only they can hear. Each stage lacks life and a ""lived in"" feeling that was seen in Dirt Rally 2.0. Gone are the little ""extras"" like logs in a ditch in Wales, different types of grass reeds in Argentina, the wonderful colours of the trees in New England, I could go on and on. Even fences, breakable in DR2.0, have apparently been reinforced with titanium. The utter lack of attention to detail adds up to ""bare minimum"" effort in order to push it out the door before Christmas. 

Clubs: The one small redeeming part of the game for me. But still lacking necessary details that could make them great. 
	- Admins need way more control. You can't even NAME a rally (wtf), so forget about requiring in-car view or anything else useful. 
	- I'd like an option to hide the name and map of the stages, just give a location and approx distance, in order to keep players guessing and help prevent practising each stage in advance.
	- ETC ETC ETC. Bare bones is kind to this game as it implies all the bones are in place which simply isn't true.

Live multiplayer: Wait, wait, wait, start, folks crash and drop out, you're on your own, wait, wait, wait. Does that sound like a fun part of a finished product? I've no idea how to fix this tbh (add a damn HOTSEAT mode and at very least local multiplayer will be fun)

Conclusion:
EA WRC has seen no attention detail and this is evident throughout every facet of the game. At best we are testing an ""early access"" game with LOADS to be added (UI updates/cars/stages/LIFE - not liveries) but at worst we are beta testing yet another EA yearly iterative game that will go onto to become WRC 24 (or similar) and sold again at full price. EA's track record suggests the latter.

To re-iterate a positive, the actual driving is the sole reason I keep loading up, playing for a bit, then quitting feeling annoyed. Either way, I guess I got value for money but can't help but think this *could* have been so much MORE.",1700449167,1704001716,False,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Car customization, logos seems lacking using fictional sponsors, they will probably monetize more Logos and realistic ones.  In career mode, event AI seems broken.

Pro's:
- Difficulty settings allow for something that is between sim and arcade, much more accessible than Dirt Rally
- Car feel is fantastic
- Graphics are incredible
- Loving the campaign format so far. Does a good job of organically working you up to WRC and Group B classes

Con's:
- There are some bugs here and there, like when you finish a stage and it bugs out when approaching the steward. Minor and not game breaking though
- Benefactors can be overly difficult to please. If I'm consistently placing first, the relationship-ometer should be building faster than this
- You do need a pretty beefy rig to play it.

Secondly, when you load into the game it's going to tell you to do 20 things, just click through them and make sure to turn down all the graphics settings. Then go into the game settings and mix everything around, it's going to be better like that than the way it came. I personally made the co-drivers calls the earliest possible, because as it came, it would tell you once you're in a corner, the notes for the previous corner, obviously not useful. If you have had any prior experience with any rally type game or just know a tiny bit about rally, the pace notes will confuse you with instead of numbers, the calls will only be short, medium, long, etc. Swap the simplified calls to normal, because you wouldn't want realistic pace notes in a ""rally sim"". About the sim part, it's not, not even close. Buy the game with the intention to have fun, nothing more than that, and considering there is no vr compatability and it was a bit of a struggle to get the game to recognize my sim setup (just a basic moza r12 with srp pedals), be ready to spend a bit of time getting things to work. I ended up just using a controller instead so that i wouldn't go over the 2 hour refund limit, but once i got to experience the loading-time-to-play-time ratio, i just quit and wrote this review instead. There has also been talks recently about EA or Codemasters firing a bunch of the programmers that made the game, just before christmas, i am happy to say i will be refunding it.

The stutters are there, but it hasnt been enough to effect my runs or opinion of the game. The game handles fantastically, I believe it to be a major step up from Codemasters Dirt Rally 2.0. The management of the career mode adds a small layer of strategy to career, and the calendar system giving you different options for the week is so much better than having to do one championship at a time like in Rally 2.0. The moments mode is also a neat mode that allows you to see how you compare up to real drivers and think its a blast. I dread asphalt in 2.0, but this game is a significant improvement.

[list]
 [*]Hitching / stuttering is consistent, and happens predictably as you drive through a stage or damage the car. If you restart, or watch the replay, you won't get the same stutter again. So the problem is easily reproducible, seems imminently fixable, and its disappointing that its still a game-breaking issue.
 [*]The menu is designed around controller input, so navigating with a mouse is awful, and elements like the replay timeline can't be scrubbed through. You can't return to the main menu until after a stage starts, so if you accidentally proceed one option too far, you inexplicably have to launch the car before you can back out.
 [*]VR support, or extended camera options (monitor offset, cabin position) are absent. VR would be particularly uncomfortable with the current stuttering problem, but camera configuration shouldn't be a [i]thing[/i] for such a competent developer.
 [*]Releasing DLC this early, on the back of a 40% sale / price drop, is baffling, as is the ""monetisation"" concept for the rest of the game. There is some kind of seasonal experience progression, or ~battle pass, that has cosmetic rewards for the ...driver avatar? So if you're the kind of player who enjoys watching the driver stare dead-eyed off into oblivion during the replay, maybe that is appealing? I really couldn't imagine who this is targeted at otherwise.

In summary; don't buy it unless you're happy to spend ~$35 for it to sit in your Steam library hoping one day, for no reason now that you've already paid for it, the game will meet its potential.

I was very certain when Dirt got the WRC license it meant the game would be 90 percent Dirt with some WRC marketing slapped everywhere. To my surprise they kept so many aspects of the former WRC games made by KT. They provided longer rally based on real stages, real team managing, historic moments, etc. 

There were many improvements made to the physics you no longer to infinite drifts on all surfaces which is welcome change. The trade off is, it's harder to slide. There is a very narrow window for dialing in hairpins and slides which many have found frustrating but I personally haven't had too much trouble. I still manage to get cars completely sideways, but you must be very confident with your throttle. 

I have hopes they will lean into the historic aspect of rally. I normally hate DLC but I would really like to see Ferrari 308gtb, Porsche SWB, Mazda 363, Mitsubishi Mirage cyborg, etc.

Update: 12/28 They have made some changes and added a new country. This game has been excellent for die hard rally fans, but ultimately is unfinished.

- Pacenotes: They are not detailed enough. Very often the note ""caution"" is used but I would prefer a description WHY I should be cautious, so that I can adjust my driving style accordingly instead of just going (unnecessarily) slowly. Calls like ""rocks inside"" or ""bad camber"" would be nice. In some locations I am missing the call ""downhill"" a lot. 

- Co-Driver: Too silent when using driver cam. The engine noise cannot be turned down enough to make it easy to understand the codriver. Most calls CAN be heard but that requires ENORMOUS concentration to filter them out from the engine noise. The quality of the audio recording of the notes could be better too. They are very ""radio""-styled but that makes some calls very hard to understand.

- Why no real stages for Portugal and Sardegna?

- Driving in night time doesnt look well because of the very low distance that is illuminated by the headlights of the car.

- Diverse performance issues that are REALLY annoying. 

- Why was it necessary to change the games menus in such a way that it takes 5x more clicks to achieve the same effect than in Dirt Rally 2.0?

- Hardcore Damage is too forgiving

- Cutting corners can be exploited a lot",1703755086,1703764363,False,7,0,0.534186661243438721,5,True,False,False

I really like the Career Mode but the Calendar was a bit confusing for me but besides that, the game looks/feels/sound really good, the selection of vehicles are in my opinion amazing, the handling feels better on my Fanatec setup, i just have a few problems but hopefully it will be fixed ASAP because it does make you crash in-game against objects (The Performance Issue)
Every few corners i get a stutter/fps drop, it does not go away even bringing down the settings from Ultra to Low, with a Ryzen 9 5950X and RTX 3080TI with 64GB RAM 3800Mhz i do believe i should be able to play on Ultra and DLSS.
But the engine they went with UR4 is in my opinion NOT THE BEST CHOICE.
Unreal Engine 4 graphics look amazing which you can admire when you receive a stutter/fps drop and crash on a hairpin.
But i hope they will optimize the game more, it's Codemasters after all they are the legends in racing games, but i have my doubts about EA Sports, will we see hidden fee options or extra's ? my guess YES IT'S EA SPORTS!

Pro's:
- Wide Variety Of Vehicle Choices.
- Beautiful Graphics.
- Amazing Vehicle Sounds.
- The Car Handling Feel Good (I own a Peugeot 208 GT and it feels exactly like it in-game or at least very very close).
- The Maps Look Really Good.
- The Map Designs Feel Fun (Probably because it's new).
- The Voice Acting Is Also Really Good (Thanks Molly Petit).
- The Replay Function Looks also really good (At some places it feels like the car floats instead of drives).
- Creating Your Own Vehicle (Not really my thing but they have it, it's good).
- Creating Races For Your Clan/Team And Compete For The Best Time.
- Design Your Own Vehicle Looks (That's always fun).
- Telemetry Support was added in.
- Virtual Reality (Not yet in-game but will be added in, i hope they fix all Unreal problems in VR).

Con's:
- Poor Performance (Random stutters/FPS drops on the most crucial time during a race).
- The Colors Looks Washed Out.
- To Many Loading Screens (I feel like the loading screens are to long and to many even if it's 5 seconds or so for loading).
- Fanatec Handbrake Register Issue (For me it is fixed).
- The Feeling Of The Wheel Feels Stiff (Not all the time it's very rare).
- In-Game EA Subscription (Have to buy Season pass for extra rewards, and a EA Subscription for some Race's in the Moments tab).
- No VR Support As Of 03/11/2023 (It will be added in later with a patch).
- Co Driver Edit (I was unable to find the co drivers edit settings for the voice, looks, country flag).

EA, ignoring the fact that EA fired tons of Codemasters employees over the holiday season, EA services are always hard to deal with. For one, I have XBOX game pass, and that is nice, comes with EA play. When I went to access EA Play, it gave me it on a random account (not mine) created in 2012. I have access to this account but cannot change the email, connect any accounts, or anything like that.  That's somewhat irrelevant to this story, but, my other account associated with my main email had been de-activated by EA. It was connected to my steam account, so I had to go through support to disconnect the account from steam (thanks Sandeep.) Which was a 30 minute process. Finally I was able to connect my new EA account to steam, which allowed me multiplayer access (you have to log into EA, btw... and your EA account HAS to be connected on steam.) On top of all of this, when I first got the game at launch, I had to refund it because I couldn't get past the first cutscene, after a hardware upgrade, the game works.

After all of this fuss, it is a genuinely amazing feeling game, probably can be one of the best rally games ever (if they fix the stutters, and the random glitches that cause you to reset on some stages for no reason), unfortunately It is owned by EA, the worst software company in existence in 2023. Maybe get it on sale? If you're really into rally, It's probably worth is at full price, but the fact that EA owns this game means I cannot really reccomend it to anyone except those (like me) who can't miss such an amazing game.

In summary: if you already have Richard Burns Rally and are bored of it, buy it, if you haven't tried Richard Burns, go play that instead.

These do not affect everyone, but enough to cause concern, to include myself. I am expecting another 4-6 months before the game is without these bugs and performance issues.

Now, on to the gameplay and physics. TL;DR is that this is definitely a title that leans more to the “arcade” side of racing than the “sim” side. My feeling is that they kept the physics and handling of the cars more simplified with extra grip so it would be easier on controller players.

Tire and suspension is not really modeled, so weight transfer feels off and grip is more of an on/off switch rather than being progressive like a real tire. There is also too much grip all around and the feeling that there is some unknown traction control assist always active even with all assists turned off.

Because of the lack of tire modeling, the car feels unnatural when you overload the rear and get the car to rotate. And forget about getting the rear to rotate in any meaningful way on tarmac with the insane grip levels in the game.

You also cannot mix tire types or cross mount like you should be able to, and there is a medium tire choice that does not exist in real WRC.

Bottom line is if you are looking for a sim, this is not the game for you. But that is not to say it isn’t fun or entertaining. It can be when it runs properly. 

But if you looking for a more “sim” oriented experience on a wheel and pedal setup, you are better off with WRC 9, 10, and/or Generations. Cars at least behave like cars, and the stage design is amazing. Sound is the only real weakness in those games.

If you want a full on true sim experience get the RallySimFans RBR .

Hopefully in 4-6 months when CM gets the game ironed out and running properly, with maybe some physics changes, I can come back and change my review. Until then, I cannot recommend this title.",1703694784,1703694784,False,9,0,0.556209981441497803,0,True,False,False

Stuttering sucks on first load of some maps for a minute, but hasn't been an issue after lowering graphics.

Was disappointed in some of the tracks being endless windy featureless dirt roads (the mexico tracks in particular). Not a lot of challenge for 20 minutes of driving. A lot of the racing felt more like going through the motions rather than something engaging. I rarely ever felt I was pushing cars to their limit but it was pretty fun in the few places I could really make them shine.

The other big thing for me is I like to race with the HUD and Co driver off. This worked great in DR 2.0 as you could always read the track ahead of you. In this there were far more often turns or obstacles that are impossible to see and that were not well marked ahead of time.

Game has a few more small things that could do with polish like the replay cam and the 'missions' where you cant have above 25% damage, I get to then end to find I have no idea what caused me to fail in the end. Kind of nitpicky there considering I don't use the HUD but still there is some improvements to be made.

ANOTHER REVIEW UPDATE: 1.3 NOW IT'S BACK TO A STUTTERING MESS....WTF!

REVIEW UPDATE:...after latest patch the game now performs MUCH much better. I almost have zero stutters. I can now enjoy the game. I'm still not happy with how it was handled. If the game was tested prior to release they should have just delayed release a week, pre orders could have still gone out on original date. Anyways atleast the game is now enjoyable!

As it sits the game runs terrible on PC. I have a 5800X3D and 4090 and I get ALOT of stutters. Running DLSS in fact makes it worse. FSR don't help either. EA is claiming a fix is coming...well see. Paying money for a game that has obvious issues... I can't tell someone to pay money to a company that could/should easily spot this and fix it prior to release. Feel like a beta tester that had to pay to test the game...it's not right. This is why EA has such a bad name anymore. Let's hope they fix this ASAP...till then back to ACC I guess.

The gameplay and the stages have a good immersion to the world of rallying!
It is a game you enjoy playing, if you are a rally fan, but improvements must be made...
The GPU optimisation is not perfect, although most of the stuttering was resolved with the patch updates (at least in my case).
Physics are improved (compared to DR 2.0), but not perfect.
Career mode is nice to play. The calendar interface would be much more helpful is it was formatted as a calendar... but you become acquainted with it in time.
As with DR 2.0, the community is the main highlight of the game!
The support seems to be there... we just need to wait and see if they are capable (and willing) to solve all the issues in the longtime.

p.s.: If you are familiar with regularity rallies... just do not try it in the game... it lacks major information (e.g. trip meter), that are really useful in such events. I believe those responsible for developing this game mode have never tried competing in a Regularity or TSD event...

I thought people were exaggerating, I see the discount at 30 EUR, so I'll see for myself. When I turn it on, EA greets me, telling me to log in, copy the code from my email, ... for God's sake why don't they just take the steam id and leave me alone, it's almost 2024 and I feel like logging to Games for Winfows again in 2007. Great, the game recognized that I have a wheel, all set after the calibration.

Then I'm greeted with the information to not play career because it's broken after the last update, which I guess no one in 
codemasters tested. Great. 2 months after release and I can't even play the whole game.
I check the steering wheel settings, handbrake, shifter (despite originally setting ""realistic veteran or whatever it was called"" mode on the intro screen it's still set to automatic transmission with some weird assists for brake force before cornering and line assists, wtf trust me a little EA).

So, if I can't play the career I will play a quick event I guess... I'm welcomed with a track in worse graphics than 2015's Dirt Rally, but I see 70 fps, so hopefully it won't be as bad as others say. I take of and the powerpoint presentation starts. I have never seen a times between frames so inconsistent in game as with this one. In a moment I'm hitting the dirt wall because of the jerkiness of the image. Even at 70 FPS it feels like 20 FPS at times. I go into the settings, everything is on high or medium, 1440p. I turn everything down to as low as I can. Game looks terrible, FPS hasn't moved much, still 70 FPS, with G-sync there should be absolutely no problem with smoothness. Wrong, it feels like the image is jerking and sometimes in a few seconds the image freezes massively for about 0.3s. It's unplayable. Refund, half an hour was enough of thic bad tech demo, I refuse to pay to be an alfatester of the future WRC 2025 game.

Vote with your wallet, don't buy this scam. It should have got an early access label but that's an insult to a lot of great early access games. Stay with Dirt Rally 2.0 which runs and looks better or RBR with community mods where physics and gameplay is still the best and some community tracks are even with 20 year old game more photorealistic and believable. Also, EA WRC has no VR support and if it will it will probably make you puke with the unstable frames.

It's hard to belive that the same studio that was behind Dirt Rally made this junk. I guess it was probably not ready but EA does not care.

Sadly that is the reason why i have to creat a negativ review.

Important things that miss:
- Setting for Aspect Ratio 21:10 / 16:9 / 16:10 / 4:3 in options
- Free scaleable Window Mode (sometimes throw window to another screen)
- Performance optimization in general, the game not running that well
- Effect optimization, Drive a Time Trail, crash/slide a long a wall and while doing so restart the stage result in a effect interaction on that position which not erases. Means it is on every restart there again. Same with Dust effects and so on.
- Shields that was in one try destroyable objects change their behavior at next try to a fixed object and result in car damage.


Now some positiv feedback:
- On my G27 the Force Feedback feels pretty good.
- Big increase in Tarmac feeling vs. DiRT or DR2.0, finaly it feels like Tarmac. Probably a slightly to much Grip, but warm racing tyres are like glue to the street, so, im okay with.


In Overall i would say, the game following the correct path, but way to early in that state of development. However, it is a known thing about Games of EA.
That is the reason why you shouldnt buy it right now, but later probably.

GRAPHICS:
7/10- on max
The game seems to try and pull a forza or woodlands thing where the game is OVERLY saturated. Also i am really not impressed with the overall pixalatedness (not a word i know). Honestly would have done better with a simple refresh.
PHYSICS:
I cant get over the fact that the cars feel like they have too much grip. A problem that exists in dirt rally where there is a ghost abs system. Buuuut this game gives you gta levels of grip. On a positive note i am glad that the ability to flip in more realistic situations is a thing.
GAME PLAY QUALITY:
An hour and a half i have played at the time of writing this. So the vehicle customization i was not amused. Ignoring the fact i set myself up for failure thinking something like automation levels of customization, the system... exists. Bit more on the android game type then the forza type, but its there. I love the concept so, much support. It just needs to be in the right direction. Creating your team is a 10/10 from project cars. But does little. Aaaaaaannnnnnnnnndddddddd, yeah. Races are too easy, not really motivated to keep playing. 
Actually hurts. I try my best to support rally in every way, but i have to make this in hope it provokes change.

1. Runs like garbage. Crashing, stutters, low FPS, pop-in, you name it.  It's here and frequent

2. Looks like garbage on my liquid cooled 4090.   Way worse than DR2.0. The sun washes everything out into looking like it just snowed...in the desert

3. Super buggy.  Saved tuning settings being set to zero, UI glitches, crashes, you name it.  You haven't been able to play career mode since the last patch because it's a guaranteed crash.  That's how bad this game is.

4. Falsely advertised features like triple screen adjustments and VR are not in the game, I don't expect they ever will be

5.Physics are ok on some cars with a bit of tuning.  But most cars don't drive properly, and forget about tarmac(which is a large portion of the game) unless you like snap oversteering in very unrealistic ways over and over

6. Absolutely stupid monetization, I find it hard to believe anyone would actually pay for a season pass to get outfits you'll never see on your driver.  Speaking of, my driver is a CROSS EYED Rob Dyrdek clone.

7. The corny voice overs make me groan so loud my partner asks if everything is ok

8. The AI is broken, they've known since launch, they won't fix it

9. EA fired parts of the team even though they know the game is broken, unfinished, and it's their fault for rushing them in the first place

10. Career mode sucks.  I'm not trying to play Mechanic Manager Simulator I'm trying to do rally racing

11. The co-driver calls are WAY too late.  

In summary this is everything you expect from an EA title:  It has missing features they lied about, it's buggy, it runs awful, it has predatory monetization, the gameplay is unpolished, it's unfinished.  

Yeah, we didn't get an arcade racing game like most of us feared - but we barely got a playable game at all

No super special stages
The power stage at the end of rallies is not punctiated enough.
Stages are BORRRIIIING and does not have ANY meaningful athmospheric artisty. Roads are sooooo wide too. Like you had WRC Generations to look at, and this is why what you do?
The tutorial texts are the worse I have ever seen, like you literally had Molly Pettit to read those.
Menus are boring and not very user friendly, why do I have to go click many times to change hybrid power, tyres etc.
Tyre change screen is disgusting, and doesn't have individual tyre changes.
After the tyre change the car in the menu still has old ones, no visual info is given.
no champion ship leagues
xbox game pass ultimates ea play that i have linked to my ea account that i have logged into this game i bought via steam doesn't have the ea play content! (like that's content that i literally pay you for albeit indirectly but locked out!) now i have to install the same game via ea launcher for ea playh content and steam for steam achievements? FIX IT!
graphics are literally garbage tier and most of it feels like PLACE HOLDER! i would expect this game to be like this IN DEVELOPMENT! not in RELEASE!
driving is worse than dirt rally 2.0, the cars has that weird something is pushing the car from behind or pushing the car from the front when braking feeling instead of power coming the tyres gripping to the road.
grip in asphalt is a joke.
snow is literally as hard as concrete!
HDR is only for TV with 1000 nits, HDR400 pc screen? get lost. Even the ea sports its in the game video on the opening has washed up colours on HDR game start. like you GOT YOUR LOGO WRONG! 
lots of bugs about when molly pettit commentary triggers in which is really annoying
the way team engineer talks to you is annoying
co driver calls even on the EARLIEST is VERY LATE! don't tell me about the corner THAT I'M ALREADY IN! if you can't catch up with my speed just jump to the next corner
default in car POV is too low and looks to up that you can't see the road in much of the places, luckily I knew numpad camera setting from older titles.
Audio is mediocre at best
particle effects are very low in number and looks like place holders that interns made.
online clubs do not have a ranking system or an option to set a pertencile target instead of just racing the best time...
did I tell you graphics are garbage? 
FFB on sliding corners is a bit crunchy while steering, seems like its clamping its values at some point but the feeling is gone at that point gravel and snow that is as aspalth is just driving like you are driving on glue
no option to automatically have manual H OR manual sequantial depending on the car!!! YOU HAD THAT ON DR 2.0!!!
windscreen does not get affected by rain or snow, wipers even on manual only works once when you press on the button. yes i tried holding down, double pressing etc. they just straight didnt impelement it, i get maybe fia didn't wanted it to make the game more arcade but why not add these as an option? also with a realistic water splash... 
rain and snow particle are also like place holders that interns made using mobile materials... so bad i can't even fathom.
i think anisotropic filtering setting is straight up broken in this game and temporal aa methods that plagues unreal engine is not helping...
no more your front bumper touching the gravel and throwing sand on your windscreen particle effect.
can't quick play a rally stage, you have to create a full rally to do that.
in time trial you can't try seasons/weather effects only pre-set dry and wet stages...
the wet leaves, or snow outside of the driving line doesn't affect anything physically. its only visuals so the all road is the SAME even though you see the (with disgusting repetitive textures) leaves/snow... 

even more negatives:
not even half of the content that was in wrc generations.
it doesn't have belgium and central eurepean rally, might be missing more didn't check all but you can't even play the full 2023 calendar!
no one shot quick play rally, no co driver mode, no split screen, no ranked leagues, no test area, lackluster unintiueve UI, garbage tier unwanted uninteresting storage wasting ""content"" is behind paywall via seasons and ea play, sounds are boring
no car showroom ffs

stages are just boring wide roads with repetitive low quality textures that has no defining features and seems like all %90 of the roads were created by a tool and no human checked/controlled them as you see the road edges sometimes have empty spaces... 

in night stages car headlight is just a light without the ""cookie"" its called light function in unreal, get a real artist to GO OVER ALL THE GAME PLEASE!, it doesn't have the car headlight visuals that you expect especially from a rally car
night stages the crowd flares has no lighting when you shut the headlights its only an unlit bloom...
the ambient light it wayyyyy tooo high so its not even black out night even with different hdr settings
you can't use the wipers like you would expect (i have manual settings, and they only work for one swipe!)
wmost of the road side objects that are for example basic plastic road marking has no rigidbody physics so it will stay they when you hit it with 1.5 ton car. 
bad pivot car physics since dr1, that just fundamentally broken, like you had a chance to fix it here!!!

also the stutters are not only the shader compiling there are also stutters on async map loads, and thats an unreal engine thing, it will probably never get fixed.

also 
No rally Cross
No Hillclimbing
why not sneak those in like you sneak the regularity that one has ever asked for?
also why does regularity do not have proper mode menus? i mena its a mode you added might as well made a menu panel for it.

edit: 10/11/2023
- the update didn't fix anything about shader compile stutters and took HOURS to complete! (ue4.27 pso caching is not enough you need to render every possible visible material behind a black screen to create caches! even junior game devs know this nowadays)
- you can't get back to your used tyre set!!! so, no, you can't use your softs a bit then take mediums for a longer stage and than well that lightly used soft is no longer available!!! LIKE WHAT? WRC generations HAD MILES BETTER tyre management! 
- games arcade physics merged with low physical interaction around the roads makes everything even worse and i think its also causing stutters when physics is calculating/clamping collision interactions. 
- you can't look at the stages list in the rally you are without going into menus under menus!!!
like it was so easy on wrc generations, why did you have to hide everything under unusuble messy menus? THIS IS NOT A MOBILE GAME!!! Look at the UI of Wrc Generations and how easy it is to navigate and how easy it is go get all the info you need while this game is just nothing, Normally when a UI is unusable and doesn't show any info they tend to be at least beatiful but this isn't beatiful either. so what gives?

edit: they manage the break the games underwhelming career mode just before christmas shutdown with a ""free"" update (as if the game updates would ever come with a price!)
but review score is still going up... this is nothing but a quick cash grab with an underwhelming underdeveloped MVP so they can sell it and get money.

Change of game engine doesn't went well: I have 11700K & 4070Ti OC, and when I play 4K with DLSS it still stuttering, which is very uncomfortable: car loses control for a fraction of a second and it's easily a lose in a race.

There are also a lot of complains for absent of VR support and lack of support for sim-racing rigs in general.

Much anticipated car builder is a fiction: there are like 5-7 parts of each type for internals (which are basicaly ""more expensive - better"") and less then 10 parts for each externals and those look bleak and generic.
And what the point to have a licenced cars then? I play it to drive Quatro, not to get those simpletone generic cars.

A career regime is literally broken and regulary wipes players' progress at the time of patch 1.4.0, and Codemasters fails to fix it in several subsequent patches. A little hope that they will get their ***t together in the future, but the hope is low, again.

Resulting in the mode being unplayable. In an update the developer has suggested a fix was on the way for maybe mid-January, but could not say for sure of the integrity of the careers save information of those current players.

Sad. Though this brought me back to Dirt Rally 2.0.

Both games have their strengths. And I do realize that latter has the benefit of being a mature title, but the driving experience is superior. Yes people like to talk about the graphics, like it's the primary thing. I think some things look better in each game. I do like the lighting and reflection for Dirt Rally 2.0, but they can be unrealistic at times. Pooled water rarely looks like a mirror. Especially when overcast. That said those settings can be turned down to suit the taste of the player.

I do enjoy the selection of locations in WRC and the game as a platform I think is better positioned. From a pure driving experience it's hard to say. I like the road degradation of Dirt Rally 2.0 a lot more, how water pooled mud feels sluggish, slippery and slow. I like the physics and speed of WRC. And I don't mind the graphic compromise with WRC to bring us larger stages. If in fact that is what happened. That said, while the weather conditions in WRC I think look better and have way more options, it definitely shows on the actual track in terms of road degradation. Where snow simply feels like a more slippery version of tarmac, lacking the substance movement characteristics it should have. Without having read so from the developer, I would say this is surely a compromise to allow players to customize the environment of the stages.

And to each there own.

In the end tho it's the launch of an unfinished and buggy product, made worse by trying to keep to development timeline. In the end I think WRC will suffer the same fate as Forza Motorsport or Diablo 4. An unfinished product that managed to upset the user to the point they found something else to enjoy. And seldom do these people come back. Seeing as I cannot return the game I will likely return in the future to see what changes have been made for a more positive experience. Problem is, how many others will?

ORIGINAL: How many people rate this poorly because it is EA? It's got its share of issues, but nothing that 3-6 months of further development during the seasonal content cannot correct or add depth. Dirt 2 was a lot different when it came out compared to what you can buy now with all the seasons included.

I will take 30km over graphics any day. Something I believe was cited by developers as a reason for changing engines. However some of the effects from Dirt 2 just don't happen. Coming from someone that lives in Alberta, Canada, road conditions here at best are dusty. If not mucky. Lots of gravel range roads. Also speaking as someone who used to own a Focus RS, you need to drive 100 of km in crap conditions for that kind of crud to pile up on your car. Unless you're mud bogging. WRC could use a little increase in some weather/road conditions, but it's more realistic to what actually happens to vehicles like this on these roads.",1700636547,1703133853,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But my recommendation for those expecting more of a simulation experience and playing a on wheel is: DO NOT BUY. Or more like: you can buy it, it's not that terrible, but beware of its shortcomings.

Many words have already been said about performance issues, bugs and so on. But frankly speaking, this is not the thing that determines my recommendation or rather the lack of it.   Surprisingly, I'm getting really good performance on my low-budget Intel i3-10100F & GeForce 1650ti - 60-75 fps on medium settings is far better than what I expected. I have not experienced any crashes whatsoever and many bugs will definitely get fixed soon, so for me that's not a biggie. Graphically, yeah, it's a bit disappointing not to see much improvement over DR2 (If any) and the blurry textures are surely a bummer , but it's not the main issue I will complain about. I do admire that the content delivered by EA/Codies is rather vast: the choice of cars is wonderful and the number of stages and their length is also quite immense. So where did it all go wrong? - you might ask.

Well, while I have never thought I might write it, the answer might be: EA. There are two very disappointing aspects of the game: driving physics and quality of the tracks. While it might be difficult to put the whole blame on EA for the latter, I’ve got a feeling that we should blame them for the former.

Ultimately, there’s something acradish about the way the cars drive in this game, as if the developers wanted to make everyone happy: those playing on wheels and those playing on keyboards or pads. But as a result, this way the game lost something which was so wonderful in Dirt Rally 2.0: immersion & sheer fun. I purposefully avoid using the word  “realism”, as I’ve never driven a rally car and while I like being challenged as a player and want as a realistic experience as possible, I can solely speak about my perception & feelings rather than realism. Anyway, the thing is that I made some back-to-back comparisons between EA WRC and DR2 and while playing WRC was somehow bland and boring, as if you don’t even need to focus to drive the cars around the stages flooring the gas pedal (with all assists off), Dirt Rally 2.0 simply brought a smile back on my face. I was again on the edge of my seat, with all my senses sharpened and the feeling of excitement & thrill of driving at high speeds rushing through my veins. My Delta Integrale lived a life of its own on the Greek bumps of DR2,  threatening all the time to go wild, whereas the same car in WRC in Chile was tamed, controllable, superglued to the surface (which is even worse on tarmac). And the track itself...

Yeah, the tracks. That’s the second main problem of this game, as the majority of them is simply boooring (especially in combination with predictable car handling). The Chile track I mentioned earlier was more or less flat with no bumps whatsoever. You just turn left, right, left, right and move on and on. Obviously, I’m not the best driver in the world and people can travel through tracks far faster than me (especially that you can cut the corners and go off-road nearly as much as you want), but again, I’m referring you, dear reader, to the sense of enjoyment. I don’t want to be the fastest, I’ll never be – I want this experience to be enjoyable & immersive. So the lack of roughness, pointed out by many other reviewers is one thing, but the scenery is the other. Some locations are better than others (for example Monte Carlo vs. Japan), the length of tracks is a huge plus and basically you are supposed to be rallying rather than sightseeing. But still, the repetitiveness of the scenery becomes nauseous and the tracks just meander in the woods (usually) like a bloody river going to the Heart of the Darkness. Now and then there are some objects & buildings, but the stage design looks a bit lazy (or the game was rushed). I’ve already accumulated plenty of playtime in WRC Generations and I can wholeheartedly say that the previous WRC-licensed game just blows EA’s product away. It’s not a regular wind, it’s a bloody hurricane propelled by beautifully designed & realistic looking stages that are thoroughly enjoyable & full of details. Even DR2 made a better job here, I believe, as if the designers put more love to their work.

So, all in all, you can buy EA’s WRC for an occasional drive, but if you ask me, just get DR2 and WRC Gen on sale instead, if you like being challenged. Both these games drive far better than EA’s product (although some cars in WRC G are a bit shit), communities are still well alive for online play & both titles deliver a lot of content to have fun with. If you want to go hardcore, you might also try RBR, but as somebody once wrote – despite the seeming realism of the title, this game is like 100 years old and barely working with all the mods on and even if the physics do seem realistic, I personally cannot make myself play it on regular basis due to the fact it feels as if it was put together with zip ties. So yeah, that’s it, there’s no perfect rally game available and there will never be one, probably. But if EA WRC ever wanted to pursue this lost cause , It must have accidently crashed into something solid somewhere along the way, as there are many better games available, despite all the hype the game received. Presumabely, It might have been a road sign - those in the game are made of the strongest material ever known to humankind, what an engineering marvel.

Take in mind that i hold EA and Codemasters to a high standart, and with this, there are some things i am counting on when aquiring a game from a very well known and experienced team, such as these. So it follows: 

-The game released with a large branch of performance issues, due to an engine change from Ego to Unreal 4. This ended up putting a huge strain on even higher end machines, for an underwhelming result in it's entirety. (Dont fall for the photoshoped and cleaned up trailers on the page, as the game itself runs and looks nothing like it.) You will notice very basic lighting, lack of envoirnmental fog and volumetry, and an overall sense of a lack of identity and ""unique look"" to each country. You can also still see a lot of players complaining about visual bugs and stuttering during stages. I am sure these will be cleaned up down the line, tho, maybe in 3 months or 4. 

-The game's UI is pretty odd and basic for a game of this apparent significance and scale. From the basic inability to mirror decals from one side to another on the decal creator, to the absence of details on leaderboards in the career mode like the car that the driver used (You'll know the team, tho, weirdly). The repairs after a stage are also dumbed down and simplified up to a point where you aren't even sure what is broken or heavily damaged, and what a quick fix or a replacement do. There is also a lack of a content share section where you could search for other player's designs or photos, and where you could upload your own. Another odd decision is that for example, to join a new club, you need to alt tab from the game, open your browser and log into race net, and do that there. It just all seems a bit undercooked for a AAA game.

-If you take a look at the latest patch notes, you will see that there is still a large ammount of features that aren't working on the game as of yet. From the single player AI that is bugged to a point where it is impossible to race against it consistently, and that alone ruins the whole career mode in it's entirety.

I think the game will hit it's true potential in half a year, but as of now, it's still more like a beta test. Buy if you are okay with early realease titles, and dont mind the process, but the game that all the youtubers are bragging about and that they advirtised is still a couple of months away.",1703102504,1703102504,False,5,0,0.511097311973571777,0,True,False,False

Due to performance issues and bugs, I regret not being able recommend EA Sports WRC at this time. E-Rallying is fun, and this game really does a good job of immersing you into the role, until it doesn't because of bugs or stutters. I do hope to revisit this review come the ""hotfix patch"" slated for mid-January.

Like most racing games marketed for a more broad user base, EA WRC encourages and rewards going fast above driving with precision and caring for the car. There is no real punishment for hitting a curb at 200km/hr or rolling your car 5 times. I find this encourages behavior that is a detriment to more focused racing simulations. Combined with the more casual approach to vehicle physics (not simulating each part of the vehicle and occupants independently, too high grip levels, no realistic downsides to unrealistic setups), unfortunately, this means that practicing this game will probably make you worse at other racing games/sims. 

The game is fun and immersive, but the overwhelming majority of my time has been frustration.

(Early Access Review)

Excellent product with some issues but overall great gameplay.
Sounds are extremly detailed and may vary based on car or the amount of damage it has.
Stages all look fantastic (atleast if you can afford the graphics to run) and are on a new level.
The other various things, such as car feeling, difficulty etc. you may experience yourself, i do enjoy the game a lot and to me its a pleasure that Codemasters has the WRC license now, because their game quality is vastly superior to KT and their previous WRC Titles.

As of now the Game suffers from:

 Shadercache issues, they do disappear over time and the more you drive but the first stage you'll play will most likely stutter like crazy, its just geting better later on untill you barely ever notice it.
On Twitter they say they are preparing for a patch in order to adress this.

Reflections and Car Mirrors do have a drastic impact on FPS right now.
The DLSS implementation has some smeary effects (most annoying is dirt on windscreen).
There yet still is no GRD Nvidia Driver out.
The base Anti Aliasing looks horrible in the games menue and should just be removed out of the Engine files, cuz its useless anyways and has to be replaced by FSR or DLSS whatsoever.

It may crashes on Rally Monte Carlo unfortunately.
------------

The Game does not fully support Dualsense Controllers (No Vibrations at all, no Triggereffects), you may want Steaminput and use it as a Xbox Controller, which unfortunate will also show the Xbox buttons ingame but you'll get vibrations.

It does Support Fanatec DD PRO (Official PS5 Wheel) but i have not seen any stock setting that you could load up like in DR2.0, so you need to configure the FFB yourself.

I highly recommend to use HDR in this Game, otherwise you may encounter extreme bloom effects, but this is quite normal by now that HDR is more or less mandatory for new games in order to achieve best image quality.

But those stutters... Them stutterings... Damn... I am one of those Dirt Rally fan boys and ive been playing them for a long time but knowing that they have been working for 5 years on this game and this is what we get.... 

From what I have played to date I can say I love the tarmac grip. The way the car bites is very convincing and pushing through a corner is great. I also find it easier at high speeds, where in dirt rally 2 at higher speeds the car would feel floaty. 

Winter stages are also better with a good feel from the car goiing through snow instead on driving on top of slightly slippier gravel. 

I love the added lengths to the stages. Having some 30+km's of track is nice and I have always preferred longer stages in Dirt Rally.

The soundtrack is great. Not as good as dirt 2 and 3 (those games have in my taste the best soundtracks of any game) but still seriously great with variety and tunes that fit nicely with this kind of game.

As for complaining I find that many cars had a better feel in Dirt Rally 2, I imagine lost from the game engine change?

I also miss the daily, weekly and monthly challenges that always kept me hooked on coming back.

And finally the massively huge incomplete disaster that is the optimisation this game lacks of.... This should be an early access or a beta. The stutters everywhere, the very basic graphics, it all ends up making the game practically unplayable! At any moment it just skips frames, slows down... The tearing is insane. 
I run my games well on my gaming PC always +100fps without any problem. I run WRC generations with every option maxed out and the game runs smooth from start to finish. Not the slithest hiccup.... Dirt Rally 2 runs at +150fps maxed out and I don't get any problems and I could swear that the game looks better that this new one!!! But this game, that is supposedly been worked on for 5 years simply runs like crap. There's no other way to put it, It's basically unplayable!

Just wait a few months to see if they fix it

Edit 2: Yeah I dunno if they are ever gonna get this one right, the performance patches haven't really delivered for me and the UI and career modes and kinda a complete mess.

EDIT: They released a patch that was supposed to address the shader related stuttering and results on this seem to be hit or miss honestly. In the patch notes they say they are fixing a number of bugs but I have seen far more bugs since the patch than before it.  Seems they didn't fix most of the biggest bugs that existed before the patch such as restarting an even not actually restarting the timer leading to one screen telling you that you won the stage but the next showing you minutes and minutes behind. Not to mention they seem to have created more UI bugs than they fixed. They really need to get these bugs hammered out and this will be a very solid game. If you aren't a huge rally fan hold off on this for now. Game is good but there are a number of very frustrating bugs currently.

overall the game is good, it has problems for sure but nothing I'm sure won't get worked out fairly quickly.

There are sporadic performance issues ranging from inconvenient to significant problems, most of these are due to loading shaders on the fly, this has been acknowledged by EA/Codies and should be fixed soon. Although it has to be said that it is very silly that in 2023 companies are still trying to compile shaders on the fly, it always causes stuttering, especially in unreal engine games, just increase loading time and pre-load them. The menus are fairly obtuse and some stuff just isn't where you would assume it to be. Also the graphics are not a significant upgrade over DR 2.0 and are overall fairly disappointing, they aren't bad but I was expecting better for sure.

The actual car driving parts is very good, cars feel responsive and terrain feels unique. It was a bit of a struggle for my F4/GT3 iRacing brain to readjust to the type of sim this is but after a bit it felt very good and natural.

It is good in terms of rally feel, but it is an awful still not polished as a game.

Bad things I find really annoying:
    1. Windshield reflects things it shouldn't, obscuring the view and some cars affected more than others. Sometimes i can't even understand what that is, and reflection moves when you turn for some reason like if it was from outside, but it cant be - windshield should reflect things from below, like dash's top view. It strains eyes and brain breaks because, SURPRISE, I've been inside a car and it shouldn't looks like that at all.
    2. TAA is bad in certain scenarios. I'd prefer to have an option to turn it off entirely. Day is not that affected. But if windshield is shaded at top, or if there is dirt or water on a windshield - it becomes a mess.
    3. Right after update that promised to fix that - it is still stuttery. For good 3-4 hours of in-game time you'll  have it a lot until all shaders recompiled while you drive.
    5. Partially fixed, Moments screen is better now, only resets you to the start of the list after event now. [Oh and UI/UX is frustrating at some places, small things that could be tolerated if everything else was good. Scroll right 20+ entries to a specific moment(new weekly thing), enter it, turns out you wanted the one next to it, pressed back - you are at the beginning of a list, scroll 20+ entries again. Want to put on new tyres at service, the action that 99% of time is done at service? It's like 5 actions to do so, also don't forget to press confirm though, just setting tyres and going back would not save your selection and would not warn you that you are going to continue on worn tyres.]
    6. You like driving while it rains or snows? You'll hate it here because they likely time traveled rain and snow shaders from 20+ years ago and then made it worse on top of that.
    8. Did I tell you objects/trees/bushes/etc. do not cast shadows from headlights? Except some objects do but only if within few meters from a car. I do care about looks if it's a AAA price tag. Even Dirt 4 had it.
    9. Optimization. Subpar performance with Ryzen 9 5900X/Radeon 6800XT at 3440x1440. Barely hits 110 FPS on Medium at less demanding locations with GPU utilization < 90%.

Other than that it is wonderful rally experience.
timizations for RDNA2 maybe?

Old fixed annoyances:
    4. Still happens, much rarer though. [Want to enjoy replay? TV style from outside? Every new camera angle - you see naked ground, and in 1/4 of a second bushes, grass pop up.]
    7. Fixed. [You on a wheel and love to use shifting style, sequential or H-pattern, based on  what car should have? Sure, but you gotta go to the assists setting every time you change cars. Like when Dirt Rally 2.0 was released, and people asked for it to be automatic based on a car and it was fixed half a year later. Why not do it at release?]

[b]Overview:[/b]
EA's WRC looks like a game from 2013 while running like a game from 2023. Unfortunately, the game still runs poorly after Patch 1.4.0, and as a bonus, your career saves were corrupted if you played before.

[b]Visuals and Performance:[/b]
WRC's outdated look is worsened by attempts to upscale it using TAA; headlights are especially prone to this, looking worse than a game from the PS3 era. The game still stutters at nearly every turn, especially if you collide with something, even on high-end hardware, undermining the overall game flow.

[b]AI and Racing Dynamics:[/b]
The AI behaves unpredictably, especially at the start, where often, even at max acceleration, they will be a few seconds ahead.

[b]Weather Effects:[/b]
Rain effects fall flat, feeling more like 2D particles inside your FOV, missing the mark on delivering authentic weather dynamics like in Dirt Rally 2.0 for example.

[b]Vehicle Dynamics - Rear Drive:[/b]
The handling of rear drive vehicles is rather frustrating, lacking the consistency that makes for an enjoyable driving experience.

[b]Conclusion:[/b]
Patch 1.4.0 for WRC doesn't deliver the needed improvements. Visually outdated and plagued by performance issues, it struggles to compete even with its ancestors like Dirt Rally 2 or WRC Generation.

The physics are still only above average, they still have the ""Dirt Rally 2.0 car sliding physics"". For tarmac, they just increased grip, so it lowers the effect of this mentioned thing, but it is still really noticeable. 

You can slightly fix the problem by tuning the car, but it exposes other weaknesses as you have to tune the car a certain way to lower this problem's effect on the driving.

Getting there so far. I've found the key for me personally is to turn off all dead zones and leave full saturation, steering sensitivity 50, linearity 6. Then it's easier to focus more on the brake timing and is enjoyable to play.

Before the new patch, I had some performance issues and sluggishness with 13600k and 6750xt, running from samsung nvme. Was getting fps inconsistencies and eventually noticed is was going as low as 30 fps. During night stages, the section of road dead in front of the car (where headlights would normally shine) looked like absolute garbage, as if there was a transition line on the screen where the quality shifted and just looked distracting. Took the handful of ultra settings I had down to high, and 8x filtering, and was seeing 70-90 fps. Things looked a little more natural.

With the new patch/update, I've had a handful of large issues with the game.

Performance is extremely inconsistent and sporadic. Sometimes upon starting a new stage, the game will get really choppy and freeze frame a few times, causing me to crash the car. With the same settings, I can have fps as low as 50 or as high as 150, for seemingly no reason at all. This is with 8x filtering, but a handful of settings turned back up to ultra. Seeing a performance jump overall, but having more issues with the new patch.

There have been times where I went to hit start and reset to track, and upon resetting I spontaneously had terminal damage.

Restarting after the terminal damage bug allowed me to start driving my car before the countdown to start the stage even began.

Biggest issue is calling out the corners and hazards - they are sometimes too early or too late, but mostly they are too vague. I would like at least 3 times more detail than the game gives me. I generally fall out of the map or crash really hard because the game decided not to emphasize that I need to slow down or angle myself correctly. Did not really have that issue in Dirt Rally 2.0 (last rally game I played) and it seems to happen in every location in most stages.

Also with the latest 1.4.0 patch, the game is suddenly laggy, which it was not on 1.3.0.

One more thing that is annoying is that while there are a lot of locations, why are many of the stages reusing the same roads. Do they also do that IRL in WRC, drive the same stages over and over again? It would be logical that they traverse the country right, not replay the same section of the map in 6 different ways. That was very annoying and boring for me, showing laziness from devs part. 

And the way the game gives penalties is dumb. Little slope where I clearly can climb out of - terminal damage. Drive into some people - 30 seconds. When murder is fine, but little slope is not. Also game not allowing to go back on road when missing a corner. I had 25 seconds still on the timer, it did not have to reset me on the road and put a 30 second penalty on my time. Give us more freedom to get back on the road.

Its a pretty half-baked cake this game. Could be so much better, but just is not very good.

The stutters, after all the updates, are still there. They are not as bad as on the launch day, when I had to spend a couple of hours just driving around in 10 fps and waiting for shaders to compile. But they are still noticeable, and definitely negatively affecting the gameplay.

Graphics are impressive, but it's hard to say they are an upgrade over DR2.0. All of the components are nicer and with more fidelity, but they just don't come together as nicely. The magic ingredient is missing. And on top of that, they're so demanding that you'll never run them maxed out. The final mix of medium-low settings that you'll find playable will probably look worse than DR2.0. You'll also have to run DLSS, which makes the in-car displays blurry.

Physics are an evolution and an improvement, but no real effort has been made to address the core issues. Cars are still pivoting around the center, resulting in an artificial 4-wheel steering. This causes tarmac to feel floaty, cars being unpleasantly sensitive at high speeds, and it's annoying to drive right next to walls. Moreover, damage model is forgiving. Wall riding is definitely viable, you can also keep hitting trees and you'll be fine.

Stages are longer, but locations feel less distinctive. 30+ km stages are a welcome surprise, but without the improvements to driving physics, they're a bit... pointless. To enjoy this kind of mini-endurance, the core driving has to be captiving. And right now, it is not.

Career's weird. I've never been into this kind of stuff, but the voice-over gets annoying very quickly. The whole scheme is also getting super repetitive. And the worst part is, the AI's broken. At the max difficulty, they were a nice challenge for me, until they randomly started losing 2+ mins per stage (all of them). Everyone's suffering from this, and this is a complete immersion-breaker.

I've never done any multiplayer, but I've heard it's painful as well. You can reset your car's damage by exiting the game between stages, or something like that.

The pacenotes are way too late, even in the earliest setting. When you're going fast (around current world-record setting pace), this will be the most common reason for crashing out. It doesn't hurt to give more settings in this department, but we probably won't get them.

There are also some audio issues, which happen with higher end headphones (crackling and pops).

Most of the cars are recycled from DR2.0, but there are some very unique and enjoyable, new additions. Some of them are very niche, which shows that some love has been put into this game.

All in all, it is clear that this release has been rushed. Was probably meant to be DR3.0, but when the WRC deal happened, the deadline got a lot shorter.

In the current state, you should only consider this game if you haven't done much virtual rallying before. It'll help you learn the basics, and will keep you entertained for a couple of days. But sinking a significant amount of time in this product, in the current state, is impossible. There are so many issues, which will be getting more and more apparent with experience.
Some of them will be getting fixed, but I'm sure the others never will (late pacenotes, crackling audio, forgiving damage, core physics issues).

If you're familiar with DR2.0 and older WRCs and are looking for a new challenge, it's probably time to move on to RBR (Richard Burns Rally). The most modern version (rallysimfans) is easy to setup, and isn't suffering from any of the EA WRC's flaws, while having much better physics.",1702684828,1702684828,False,7,0,0.568109989166259766,0,True,False,False

Albeit the game might offer that experience, I am not willing to play a game where running everything on ultra low makes my pc stressed like its running 6 separate games at once. It is quite evident that the game is simply poorly optimized, as running dirt 2.0 on ultra I get max 60degrees whilst here on ultra low I get a low low temp of 82 degrees, which somehow even trespasses into the menus.

Instead I can get a stable 165 fps with the price that my pc nearly explodes whenever the game is open, let alone when I am racing.

This game is yet another example of AAA studios being way too comfortable selling unfinished products knowing people will buy it anyways. All we can do it advise people who are looking to potencially buy not to until the game reaches a somewhat respectable level of polish.

The campaign mode it's a great innovation, you have a team, engineers and having to manage money and please your sponsors, so far I like it, but I don't know how well it is balanced compared to the ones like Gran Turismo 3.

haven't experienced any stutter after my initial 3 minutes tweaking of the graphic settings (I usually lower reflections and shadow quality) and remain above 80fps on midrange hardware.

- This game is [b]not a sim[/b], not sure why they market it like one. Tarmac is improved, but still subpar and feels like driving a go-kart. If you are fine with having a sim-cade style game, this is fun. Snow and gravel do feel fine - just not realisitc. But if you care about playing the most realistic rally game possible, you're better playing Richard Burns Rally.

- [strike] There is no option for combined H-Pattern and Sequential based on the car, which Dirt Rally 2.0 HAD.. this means you have to go into the settings and change it yourself per car. Very annoying especially since the options key is F1 and not rebindable to a button on your wheel [/strike] EDIT: This has been added in the latest update!

- Performance is still poor. I've never had it crash on me, but there are lots of stutters and FPS drops. Game arguably looks worse using UE4 compared to Dirt Rally 2.0(looks fuzzy/soft)

- Missing GT cars

- Clutch actuation is [b]HORRIBLE[/b]. Requires 100% clutch depression or you will miss a shift... have the devs never driven a manual car before?? This was an issue since Dirt Rally 2.0

However, the game is overall pretty fun. It's quick to load up and get into a stage. Car sounds are very nice. Calls can be inaccurate sometimes, but are usually adequate. They've recently updated the game to support bass shakers and motion rigs as well.

I would say in its current state, it's not worth it. Physics are only slightly improved from Dirt Rally 2.0 and it's missing features/content from it's predecessor. Arguably looks worse- definitely performs worse and still has unrealistic physics (this is disappointing as they seemed to market it heavy as a sim)

At this moment in time (patch 1.40) this game is still extremely rough around the edges, and unfinished. In my opinion, I think this game needed at least 6 more months to be in a releasable state. This was no doubt rushed out due to EA wanting more money, so pushing it out just before Christmas was their only priority. 
In the 10 or so hours I've played this I've had around 12-15 hard crashes to the desktop, constant stuttering, an enormous amount of graphical glitches, and have noticed things that are glaringly obvious even at a cursory glance that have somehow been missed by Codemasters completely. This truly feels unfinished. It's like playing an early beta at best.
I'm very disappointed in this game as overall its got the bones of a good game, but with all the issues its not something I feel like I want to put anymore time into at the moment. Mostly because I can only play it for maybe 30 minutes before it crashes again.
I've tried high, medium and low settings and nothing fixes the issues.
Also the rain effects in this game are the worst I have ever seen. I have seen PS1 games with more convincing rain effects.
Graphically this game isnt pretty at all. it very much looks like a last gen game. In fact Codemasters own Dirt Rally 2.0 looks much better by some distance. 
The fact that someone actually signed off on this being released in this state is just pathetic money grabbing. Greed will sully this and the future releases.
Also if you wish to progress in the games ""Battle Pass"" you will need to buy separate DLC as well as being signed up to EA's abysmal EA Play service. So that's not 1 but 2 paywalls to progress in this game.

If you like challenging yourself and can have a lot of fun doing that, or maybe playing online time trials (though I haven't tried that myself), then this might be the game for you. Do not expect the AI to challenge you, it is bugged in at least 2 ways that I've noticed. In some races, maybe a quarter of the time, the AI will act normally, and be faster or slower according to the difficulty you selected. On the other hand, about a quarter of the time, they will be very fast, and lowering the difficulty does nothing, they will always be that fast or faster. About half the time, they will be much, much slower than you. Like 2.5 minutes slower in a 5 minute stage. Also, I have never seen a main event where during the last stage, the AI wasn't this slow, meaning that as long as you are less than 2 minutes behind first place, you are guaranteed to win the event. 

Also, some of the UI stuff doesn't feel finished, like the chief engineer skill menu has a bunch of skills that all stay highlighted after you hover your mouse over them, until you leave the menu and open it again, or the fact that after every stage I've ever finished, a bright red SPLIT: +0:00:00 comes up, no matter what time I got on the stage.  It's kind of like that stuff was an afterthought.

So, that annoys me, and I put it in the review first in the hopes that these issues get more exposure and that maybe down the line they get fixed, because I actually love this game, and I want it to be better.

So, let's talk about the good. The driving physics are amazing, the cars feel great, and it is a constant challenge adapting to new cars and road surfaces. I'm constantly learning new driving techniques to stay competitive and I always have a blast sitting down and playing this game. The stages and locations are interesting, and there isn't too much track reused between the stages at a single event. The pace notes are much better than DiRT 4, the last rally game I was playing, and the co-driver always reads them at the perfect time.

There is a reason why Dirt Rally 2.0 consistently has 30% more players on at all times despite being 5 years older. EA sports WRC is less satisfying to complete a stages on. Period. 

Both Dirt Rally 2.0 and EA Sports are ""simcade"" but WRC took out even more of the difficulty curve that players love so much. 

The Loose surface physics are dumbed down on all stages except Scandia. Scandia's loose surface physics is the step-up I would have expected the dirt and snow physics to be as an improvement from Dirt Rally 2.0.

The Tarmac is just weird. I can not for the life of me depend on the predictability of the tarmac physics to really drive on the edge when the tires loose grip unless I use clutch to shift every time. But at that point why not just shoot for a full authentic simulator...? I mean... Its us people who are going to keep this game alive in the end. Not the casual horizon player. Nothing wrong with horizon but you need to cater to who the game is for; enthusiasts.

Maybe most people will all say they love WRC more or its more chill but the human brain's reward systems will always prevail in the end and the player count is obviously evident of that.

People were expecting something on par or a step up from Dirt rally 2.0 in its gameplay. While I can definitely appreciate that now I can feel the car's aerodynamics working with the air at high speeds or that that are many locations, long stages and cars from launch. However, these things just dont make up for the loose surface physics being dumbed down and tarmac slip angles being annoying.

But I think the most depressing thing is the thought that there have been communication about a lot of things from the devs but there is no mention of updates to the physics for the foreseeable future.",1702344943,1702344943,False,1,0,0.502074718475341797,0,True,False,False

The driving is amazing, Unfortunately there are some very bad bugs in the game and some questionable choices:

- The focus is on club racing. Which is great. But not if you have self repairing cars and fresh tires every stage. Also the handling of the leaderboards are a nightmare. How come that the club feature is a downgrade from Dirt 2.0 but yet is the prime mode they want us to play??

- Career - this is so weak. Absolutely no excitement and depth to it.

- Multiplayer - bring back Dirt 3 multiplayer format. That was fun!!

I feel like Codemasters got pressured in by EA releasing a game in such a terrible state. Luckily the driving is so great that we can live with the negatives for a while. Let's hope the devs are busy and patch this game enough to make it decent.

You ever watched Bake Off? Y'know, the baking show, where they end each week on a Showstopper Challenge, where the bakers bring their expertise and their personality into an original design. Every week, there tends to be one contestant that has a brilliant idea, an excellent background, you know they can perform, they know what they're doing, and then they show you the recipe, they show you your pitch, and you feel a pit in your stomach because you immediately know, on this timetable, they cannot make all of that. There are too many things going on. There are too many ingredients, too many things to make, too many separate components, where they could've done one thing perfectly.

I kind of expected when EA was taking over Codemasters that something like this might happen (don't forget, stuff like PitCoin and DR2.0's always-online play came [i]before[/i] EA's involvement), but this is really one big baffling culmination of it.

The stages are perhaps the best in rally video games, ever. I adore them. They are massive, they are sprawling, they are beautiful, they are varied. They truly feel like an adventure in disparate parts of the world, massively distinct and unique. Safari Rally will annihilate your suspension, Mediterraneo brought me back to CMR2.0 in the best way, and Monte Carlo feels like a brand-new beast in non-snowy conditions, a feat I never expected. This is all incredible.

and the only reason I don't recommend this is because that doesn't really matter, unfortunately.

Co-driver calls are dry, listless, uninformative, sometimes outright wrong, and droned with no change in cadence or pronunciation. ""triple caution."" is said with all the emphasis of ""would you like your receipt."" despite meaning ""CHECK UP NOW OR WE DIE"". No matter which voice you pick, the instructions blend together into a mush pretty quickly.

The career mode is underbaked, offering nearly no rewards for performing well unless you meet certain specific criteria, which are always very specific championships, meaning you don't [i]really[/i] have the freedom to do whatever championships you want, because participating in most events means you only [i]lose money and resources[/i] in exchange for [i]nothing.[/i] (...well, can't say that isn't like real racing, though.)

The car builder... I like it quite a bit, I was rather giddy over it. But it DOES feel largely cosmetic, and speaking of cosmetics, dear god this stupid battle pass thing. Levels in the top right corner constantly (very, VERY slowly) amass XP, threatening to permanently lock away suits and liveries if you don't play A Whole Lot Of This Game Non-Stop Right Away Right Now. Perhaps luckily, they are ugly as sin and do not match with any vehicle in the entire game; no matter what you choose to wear, you will be an eyesore. I have never thought about what WRC drivers wear for suits until now. Some rewards are locked away behind VIP tier, which is sold separately or a bonus for pre-orderers (hi! that's me!), and others are locked behind the EA Play subscription service. Specifically, the EA Play subscription service for that platform; if you don't have EA Play through Steam specifically, you will not get anything.

Including the specific locked-away Moments. Moments are supposedly meant to be recreating bits and pieces from WRC history but almost instantly derailed into just ""race this car at this stage."" and a big ol' label of ""FICTIONAL"" with no pretense for justification; can't be helped when they're pumped out [i]one a day[/i] and easy as all hell. Interesting concept, bland execution.

Performance is miserable, with plentiful stuttering and hitching in a game about rhythm. Stages are not visually pleasing to say the least. If you have the countdown timer on when coming back from a pause, in DR2.0 it was a countdown from 5-4-3-2-1 with appropriate timing sounds to hop back in; here, it's muted and off-rhythm and just counts it on screen with each number lingering for, like, a second and a half, proving worse than useless.

And that's kinda what this comes down to, as I find myself just hopping into time trials and having a decent time. There had to be less here. Somebody wanted to impress their new licensee and gave their storied devs no time to work on 16 separate big ol' back of the box features, and in turn, what could have been a supremely satisfying game for a niche audience is now an underbaked buffet for a wider one that I can't imagine will be enticed. I do hope people just hop into a rally game because ""hey, why not"" and end up liking it; CMR2.0 did that for me as a kid and I'd love this to reach a wider market. But the core gameplay's gotta work first before any of this other cruft can be glued on. That singular focus is what made DiRT Rally sing, and it's what WRC struggles horribly with. Hopefully I'm coming back later and swapping this review around to a positive when it performs better, but I really hope this isn't just going to be the design trend going forwards.

Let 'em do what they do best, because they do it better than anybody when they have the time. Here, it really feels like they didn't have much at all.",1702056386,1702056386,False,6,0,0.586840391159057617,0,True,False,False

1 - Reverse is useless. If you hit an object and have to back up to get back on track, you are going to take the penalty, the car will not move and I tried a variety of vehicles, AWD, FWD, RWD, it matters not.

2 - ""Get back on track"" = USELESS. The option to use the Down Pad to get back on track appears also too late and you are going to take a penalty. When it DOES appear on occasion, it has to be hit several times to work - again, penalty.

2 - Snow and Asphalt = Cars are made of paper or tin foil. A slight breeze it seems would lift you into the sky, it is as if the cars weigh 5 pounds total. The tiniest pebble will send the car flying sideways into the ditch, yet when you try to reverse it, it weighs 10 tons. If you go by a turn and overdfrift - car outweighs the earth itself. The only mode I found that seemed to be worth racing in was Dirt. Dirt is awesome, the cars seem to have weight. Snowtires = useless.

3 Rally School - had a great time until the very last Asphalt event, the car all of a sudden weighs again 5 pounds and goes bouncing off hidden things in the road. On the very last stretch, the car goes all over the road for no reason whatsoever like the slight breeze is blowing it around. Stick is perfectly straight, yet the car just decides to weave all over the road until I go off the road to get the time over 1:30. Then it is fine, but it *must* crash on the backstretch. Was having a lot of fun until this time. Who coded this? Who said, "" Hey cars that weigh 0 will be fun to handle here?"" Yet, trying to get it to drift around those hairpins...it is like a semi.

5 - Builder cars = What was the point? Can barely use it in Career mode and now it's filling up a slot. The only events mine was able to be used was in the snow events where it handles like total crap. Is it snow or ice? Because again, the car says it weighs almost a ton but....it does not act like it on the track. Why can't I use it for other events? Why is the only place it seems to have *any* gravity effect is when it is off the track? Why does it not ""sink"" into the track like that and stick? Sure sticks in the ditch REAL well!

6 - Placement errors. I have been penalized up to 60 seconds by having to get put back on the track only to be put on the bank of a cliff or into another area you cannot get past without again, getting stuck, hitting reverse which does not work as your car now weighs the density of a Black Hole and will not budge, the Down Pad option does not show, and then wallah - 2nd Penalty! and you FINALLY get put back in the middle of the road. 60 seconds behind....THEN mysteriously, you finish the race only 2 seconds behind the leader when you were 25th last stage. Huh?!?!?

7 - I almost forgot! How many SCREENS DO I HAVE TO OK AT THE END OF AN EVENT?!?!?! omg, I thought Starfield was bad on nested screens but this one is #1. I counted 6 times I have to say OK just to get back to the dang screen to say ""End Event"" I just want to END THE EVENT, I do not care about trophies and lists and times and kudos and whatever recap you wanna show me. I was there, I saw it firsthand the first time. End the damn event!

I mean, I play ALOT of racing games and for the most part, I like them all. I have loved the Dirt series from the start and the DIRT tracks are awesome here. But the Snow and Asphalt the cars seem to be made of glass but man, you get them to roll or miss a turn and they all of a sudden weigh the Sun.

Audio/Visual is ok, variety of events are good, replayability is good. Dirt is great.

Maybe some patches can fix these issues I have named and I will change my recommendation. But, for now? Stick with FH or the Crew or a past Dirt series or heck, play a flight simulator since these cars want to take off into the sky on a slight breeze.",1702022863,1702023275,False,1,0,0.477775603532791138,0,True,False,False

Thankfully I can say this game is on the same level as the old dirt rally games, with improved graphics, feel, and a couple of extra features. That being said, the game still isn't very well optimized, and the new car builder feature could have had a bit more to it. I'm a little disappointed that rally cross isn't in this game, mainly because it would be a fun way to play live against friends. I also think it's silly that there's a battle pass in a rally sim game, but it's not like anything important is locked behind it so it's not a big complaint. It's nice that for a full, solid game it's only $50 when most are $70 now, and I got it for $35 since I already owned 2.0 and got the bundle. Career mode isn't anything special but it has everything I'd expect from one, though I don't really feel like playing career anymore after playing 3 seasons and climbing from junior to WRC. The AI difficulty seems odd, they suck most of the time at 60/100 difficulty but seem to do a lot better in certain situations, which isn't super common but it happens enough to make me question what to put the difficulty on for certain stages, such as ice on pavement. The club feature is fun, especially if you have friends to play with. The analysis feature on racenet.com that ties into clubs is elite, it creates a detailed video that you can watch to compare your run vs your other club members, and my friend and I cried laughing at some of our big mistakes.

Not sure why people with higher graphics cards than me are complaining about the games performance. I have a regular RTX 2070 (non super) and have no problem running the game on High graphics preset, with a few things turned to ultra that didn't affect my FPS at all. Using DLSS balance (not quality as I can't see a difference when your speeding by everything anyways in a racing game). DLSS Balance gives me about 10 more FPS over quality, I'll take that. My FPS is usually around 80-100 FPS @ 2k resolution and I have a VRR monitor. Everything is buttery smooth.

As far as stuttering, I've seen it a few times here and there, but the stutter is so micro (like 10MS) that I'm not even sure I would have even noticed it if I hadn't been reading all the comments about it. Maybe others are getting larger stutters but I haven't been. 

There are few things I do not like so far:

1. The menus. They slide around by themselves when the mouse gets close to the edge of the next option. Also scrolling your mouse wheel will make the menu rubberband all over the place. Its like the code from the previous thing I mentioned (auto scroll) is conflicting with the movement of the menu from the mouse wheel input. This means you basically have to use the keyboard to navigate some of the menus or when using the mouse wheel you have to do it very slowly, one item at a time and wait a sec. This needs improving.

2. The audio of some of the cars I feel like sounds worse than DR2. Some of them sound like running a vacuum cleaner. Mind you haven't driven any of these in real life, so I'm not sure what they actually sound like in person, but it sounds odd to me. The audio of surfaces (tires digging into the dirt, kicking up rocks, tires sliding around) all sound a bit off as well compared to their clarity in DR2. I don't know how to describe, other than I preferred the surface effects in DR2 more. In DR2 it gave me a really good sense of the terrain I was on, and if I was safely breaking or accelerating. In WRC I am having to question what is happening (am I gripping or sliding?)

3. Time trial results do not show your old vs new personal best. DR2 would should your last best time, so you can directly see how much better you did. Please add this back in!

4. Ghost option - why is this not on by default? You literally have to turn it on at the beginning of each time trial race.  [strike]And you can't turn it on until after you have launched. So you have launch, pause the game, go to the menu and turn it on, and resume.[/strike] DR2 you turn this on once, and it is set forever. Please fix this!
Edit: Looks like you can turn on your ghost and other players ghosts from the service area under event details.

Other than that though, the game is a lot of fun with what I have played so far. Hopefully some of these things will be improved in the future. Haven't played enough to say how the game as whole is.",1699217278,1701912008,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First off, I love rally style sim racers. I have played Dirt Rally 2.0, Dirt 3, and KT Racing WRC 10. Of all the games I've played, I LOVE Dirt Rally 2.0.

When I heard Codemasters were going to get the WRC license, I was excited. While KT Racing's WRC was good, it left much to be desired when compared to Codemasters' Dirt series.

First impressions, I immediately noticed a downgrade in graphics compared to Dirt Rally 2.0. Textures popped in, the humans or people in the track look like androids. With all graphics options set to High, the graphics looked very downgraded compared to DR 2.0, at times, I felt I was playing a previous gen game. 

The game stutters, making it an unpleasant experience and hinders in my ability to gauge or assess which maneuver to anticipate making with upcoming road hazards or obstacles. 

The game has frozen twice. Once, causing a memory leak and the other being stuck in a loading screen.

After that, I decided to put this game down and went back to the DR 2.0 and WRC 10. 

This is not worth what they are asking for with the state that it is in.

EDIT: Patch 1.3 or 1.2

While this patch has done a great job with getting rid of stuttering, the game is still crashing to desktop mid-race in Kenya or Monte Carlo stages (They are the only stages I've played so far.)

Update 12/06/2023
I occasionally come back to this game. It's an enjoyable experience when the game doesn't crash, however, crashes continue to occur.

The force feedback on this game is better than the KT Racing WRC series, but worse than Dirt Rally 2.0. There is hardly any engine rumble and other force feedback feature. Only time I feel the engine rumble is at the beginning of the race in which I'm throttling at Red Line.

Career mode is cool, but sucks at the same time. It's hard to understand when you're competing in multiple races and can't keep up with which races you need to continue on with or skip for the week.

Driving school is okay. It was not what I was expecting it to be. Would be cool the Co-Driver gave you prompts such as, ""Lightly use handbrake here as you turn"" or something of that kind to teach players what they should be doing in order to control or maneuver their vehicles.

Graphics still suck. The NPCs look robotic or on LSD with their eyes bulged out and wide grins. I remember in Dirt Rally 2.0 watching my character grin and squint his eyes when the vehicle hit a bump and the co-driver moving his lips as he gave calls. These two in EA WRC look dumb.

The game is still unoptimized. I am playing on a 3900x, 32 GB DDR4, and RTX 3070 rig and still get stutter and slowdown in certain section meanwhile keeping my anti-aliasing at high, ground covering at high, reflections at high, anistrophic filtering at 8x, and 1440p resolution.

Pros
- Great selection of Cars from new to old. It is great to have official WRC cars.
- Long stages and more variety of locations.

Cons
- Stuttering Performance issues. This sort of goes away after several hours of gameplay but this is bad to have if you initially installed the Game or having to reinstall. This really makes playing the Game frustrating when you need precise input.
- No Daily/Weekly/Monthly Challenges like DR 1.0 and DR 2.0. They have the moments section but it is not as fun as before. You can kind of make up for it by joining Clubs.
- Career Mode is dull and not fun to play. Better off to play in Championship/Time Trial/Clubs.
- EA Play integrations and rewards are hallow and locking some moments away with a EA Play subscription is absurd. 

Overall, I think the Gameplay is fun but the Cons really causes the whole game to look bad. I'll still play it from time to time but do not recommend purchasing it full price as of now.",1701668725,1701668725,False,4,0,0.52230072021484375,0,True,False,False

The core game is very fun, with a decent range of assists which can be modified to different levels (so ABS, Traction Control etc. have a value of 0 to 5 rather than just off or on) so it caters to people of all skill levels.

A very large variety of stages, lots of different environments, and each stage goes from 5km to about 30km on the longer side.

There are definite problems, there's shader compilation stutter (which was improved in a previous patch but not fixed completely yet), AI is wildly inconsistent with the kinds of times it'll post in solo rallies or career, saved tuning setups will bug out, but hopefully all of these are things that can be patched.

WRC fixes every issue I had. The driving is an absolute treat, I don't know if I've ever purely enjoyed driving in a racing game this much. It has some lighting glitches but so did DR2 at launch, and my system is technically just a little below min specs but still running it at 60fps, so I'm not going to complain. I already know I'll be sinking hundreds of hours in here as well, it's just such pure fun, and such an excellent dedicated rally game.
My one complaint is that I miss the wide variety of made up but believable liveries from DR2. They really made it feel like we were our own rally team without having to do all that work ourselves in the livery editor. I miss just having those available, so I hope lots more are added in the future, and not just for the WRC class cars. But I think that's a pretty minor complaint. I can't stop thinking about this game and I always want to play more.
I do wish it had some more assists though, I have no idea why their inclusion is scorned by so many fans when you can just not use them if you don't want. A driving line + auto-braking at the absolute minimum should be standard. On top of being able to introduce rally to more people, sometimes you just want to sit back while learning a stage or do a smooth, low effort run.

I do have some gripes with the game that i imagine will be fixed over the next few months. Some are obvious and should never need a patch, like if i set full manual, don't make a sequential car use a clutch and shifter. It should default to what the real world car would use. Within Moments, EA immediately gets greedy and tries to charge for a subscription to play a couple of stages, which is absolute garbage nonsense. I also sat in a bunch of online lobby's waiting to play and nothing ever happens. I'm assuming a race is in session but it's not letting me know that. A ""Quick Play"" race ends up taking an incredibly long amount of time just to start. 

Otherwise, this is a true successor to Dirt Rally 2.0, even in its early stages. While i've never driven on a rally stage in a rally car in real life, the stages seem true to life. They can be ""boring"" but again, it's a recreation of the actual world. If you drove down any one of these dirt stages in real life, it would be dirt, trees and more dirt... just like in the game. The graphics are very clean, the detail on the surrounding areas makes the game very immersive and the cars feel awesome. I'm rocking a fanatec setup and every bump translates to the wheel in a believable way.

I feel like this is a early access game and we are beta testing it for them , which is not a good feeling. The graphics look great when they work, but the stuttering frames ruin the gameplay of the game, and it is CONSTANT, even after updating it saying they have done fix's.

I like this game but they need to fix a few things before I would recommend it to other people.

Pros:
-Career
-Good/fun Rally game.
-Good easy to navigate menu.
-It doesn't feel soulless like 1.0 and 2.0.
-Voice acting for career immersion (not just co-driver).
-Good variaty with tracks and cars.
-Build your own car (basic).

Cons: (Rant)

-As of now there are issues with slight stuttering, needs a patch.

-Graphical issues, grass clipping through the cockpit interior, sometimes weird lighting reflecting from outta nowhere and the worst rain I think I have ever seen in a game in the last 15 years, it is falling in slowmotion and it almost looks like it is layered on top of the screen, almost like a placeholder.

-EA (You can never know what they will pull so it is always a risk).

-Custom vehicle skin at first glance look like it behaves like in Forza MS (2005) but it actually plays like in NFS Shift meaning you can't mirror layers, see it's coordinates, copy paste nor move the camera while editing so it is near useless.
Also you can't add real brands like Redbull etc. only fake one that look out of place since they look more like IT or womens' clothing. Not car parts or tools. Someone didn't understand the task.

-""SuRpRiSe MeChAnicS"" not much now other than avatar clothing but I saw some missing cars from 2.0 that might become DLC.

-EA Tracks, no not the good ones like in NFS HP2 or Most Wanted. The modern ones that sounds like elevator music mixed with whitegirl feeeelings autotuned into oblivion. VERY out of place for a Rally game. Who ever picked these and thought it was good idea is a disconnected person who not only should be fired but also slip face first into dogshit since it is equally enjoyable to this music, fair is fair.

-Genderbender nonsense, thankfully it is so minor and optional that you can play the game without ever having to see it.
Funny irony: for some reason they named the female voice for the co-driver just ""English #02"". Guess EA think women are not ""equal"" or ""strong on their own"" but instead only second. You nailed it guys gj.

I will play it and enjoy it even though I have to turn off the ""music"". 
If they fix the stuttering, graphical issues and the skin customization then I would give a thumbs up.

If they for some reason fix the rest of the things I listed as cons this would be a 10/10.",1701598310,1701599294,False,12,1,0.553183615207672119,0,True,False,False

The Good:

-The game physics are obviously improved from dirt rally 2.0, and feel much less... floaty?

-The maps are excellent, while maybe a little less detailed that Dirt rally, they are able to me much longer, reaching 30+ km, with a good mix of gravel, asphalt, and snow

-Oh my god there are so many cars, I belive equal to that of Dirt rally (totally could be wrong, I mainly stuck to the '95 suburu

The Bad:

-The elephent in the room is preformance, with a 4060 ti and a Ryzen 7 7800X3D i should not be getting occasional stutters (and even one hard crash out of nowhere) while for the most part the game runs just fine for me, older machines may not be able to run this game great, keep that in mind.

-the little ive played in the campain is... rough, it works on a week by week basis, with you only being able to start championships on the week they start, there is no guerrentee that its for a class that you have a car in, so if you dont have the budget, you have to waste the week on talent scouting or resting crew members, though i havent played it much, there still very well be enjoyment to be had

-The car builder is lackluster, you change internals based off Bad but cheep, mediocre in price and preformance, or good but expensive. costomization visually is pretty meh as well, with only a few body pieces for each costomisable part of the car.

The Ugly:

-The graphics at max settings are... ok? its not the first thing i really care about, but the game dosent look amazing, pretty much up to par with Dirt Rally 2.0, which is fine

-The hud is reminicent of mobile games, while not being as bad (in my opinion) as Dirt rally 2.0, its not the largest improvment

-The battlepass is hilarious, while no cars are behind a paywall (yet) a $6 gamepass in a $50 game that has items locked behind a further $10 a month EA+ subscription... its pretty bad, even just for cosmetics, but expected from EA. There is absolutely no reason to buy the battle pass, and it should be kept that way.

**Edit**

After some digging i have found that letting the game run for a long time seems to smooth things out. It seems to be ur4 issue when loading shaders. i have found letting the intro scenes play out and just running time trails when the game is first booted up can help quite a bit. i still feel i shouldn't have to suffer through the games issues until they sort themselves out isn't very engaging or immersive. my recommendation for those also working through these issues is to run time trials on stages that are more demanding on the system, eg: lots of ground cover and trees, water splashes, weather effects, both day and night. running a few of these types of stages before settling into career makes for a much more enjoyable experience. 

with all of this said not all players have the time to "" warm up the game"" every time they want to play. i am confused as to why the shaders are not compiled when the game is booted. i would rather a loading screen that takes a few minutes then a game that doesn't play well until you have had it running for a half hour or more. 

until these issues are resolved i cannot recommend this game. but please keep in mind i still really love what this game is and could be, it just needs some work.",1699914808,1701435330,False,2,0,0.490539610385894775,0,True,False,False

A good game, but just feels unpolished, a lot of basic UI errors or just things that don't quite make sense?

Quality checking on this game feels skipped. A few examples are:
Wrong Flags for IRL drivers (Elfyn has a British flag even thought the Welsh flag is in game?)
Crew Chief perks remain highlighted after moving off them.
Difficulty does almost nothing, playing at 70 difficulty and leaving a 40 second gap on a stage with multiple mistakes does not feel at all punishing.

Career is cool, but could definitely do with some work. Budgets are pointless, there is almost no reason to not fully upgrade your builder car from the get-go. The crew chief talking to you about literally everything make me want to leave this plane of existence. Could squeeze a co-op career as well to add to the life-time of this game, everything is better with friends.

Damage is very inconsistent, you can drive full speed into a tree and be fine, but hit a wall at the wrong angle and it's terminal damage. Also punctures feel more RNG than a punishment for bad driving. Roll your car 4 times and you're A-OK, clip a stump in the first 20m of track and you're down a tyre. Also 1m30s to change a wheel is a joke, yeah take your time boys not in a rush or anything. The wheels are literally designed to come off when needed. (reduce to 1 minute at least come on).

Other than that it plays alright, EA have obviously kept their leash around Codemasters which is very evident through gameplay.

Also locking content behind EA Play is a joke, we've payed £45 for this game, give us the content we paid for you animals.

TLDR:
Decent game if you just want to drive.
Locking content behind a paywall should be punishable by death.

If I could, I would rate this as 'Mixed'. 
There have been improvements, but a few steps back too, mostly with graphics and lighting. It looks like this release was aimed at performing on consoles, due to the lack of clarity, repeated assets, repeating textures and low quality lighting. The drop in visual quality is massive compared to DR 2.0 or even WRC10 & WRC Generations.

I've waited until the first patch was released to post my review. Now that the patch is out and I've run some tests, I can share my experience so far.

I'm comparing this title to Dirt Rally 2.0 and WRC Generations.

[h3]Pros[/h3]
- Lots of content (Tracks and Cars)
- Slightly improved physics
- Improved asphalt grip
- Improved FFB on Fanatec CSL
- More engaging and varied career mode
- Great car sounds
- Improved stage design
- Improved dust particles
- All devices worked right away
- Upscaling 
- More upbeat/energetic music 

[h3]Cons[/h3]
- Stuttering 
- Frame drops 
- Can't use car reflections without losing 20-30fps
- Lighting is dated, too bright, and flat
- Very few specular highlights; every shader looks like plastic
- Snow and rain effects look basic but functional while stationary. Once travelling at speed they quickly turn into white noise
- Car models look lower quality than DR2.0
- Trees are very low quality and limited in number along the track. Iberia has the same tree repeated countless times on the right, just with small changes in rotation and size. 
- Road textures look like a repeating pattern
- Water interaction is nonexistent. Rain goes through objects and doesn't affect the windscreen much, like in DR2.0
- Ruts and tire marks appear very late
- Crowd makes rally look bad as a sport, small groups doing almost nothing. Rally crowds are large in real rallies. Nighttime races in Monte are crazy with the red flares, in game they look pretty poor. 
- Season Pass (The cosmetics are bad in quality and design aesthetics, I was hoping we would get brand/team outfits rather than simple vector from illustrator.)
- I'm not sold on the car builder yet, I like it but seems very limited. 

I hope Codemasters are able to improve on some of these points, as many others have shared similar opinions.
Since the patch, performance has improved a little but still has some way to go.

I've been looking forward to this release, but my excitement has severely lowered after seeing the drop in graphical fidelity and performance before VR is released. 

I will update this review to positive once we get another couple of patches to address the performance issues and improve the graphics to DR2.0 standards or close. 

EA WRC is a fun rally game hampered by performance and graphics issues, the tracks are great and handling is improved. Career mode and the Moments tracks are really enjoyable. 

Codemasters have built a reputation on quality and this is the only reason I pre-ordered, hopefully they will do their thing and give us a worthy successor to Dirt Rally 2.0.

- The pacenote audio is terrible. It's mixed with the engine sound and can hardly hear what they say. Why?? Why you not at least provide the option that refers to DR2.0??? You think you smart enough to know every player is using fugging nice stereo sound system??
- It's the end of year 2023 and this game is developed using UE4???",1699009418,1701269223,False,3,0,0.516369044780731201,1,True,False,False

Lets start with the good stuff:
- the Handling feels very nice. A huge step up to Dirt Rally 2.0 and the older WRC Games. Might not reach Richard Burns Rally, but it doesnt matter since its better in every other way. This game is just so much fun to drive
- Setting up my Wheel was easy (I use a Fanatec CSL DD) and it feels very nice. I didnt have to change much with the Force Feedback
- Car Sounds are fantastic, like always from Codemasters
- the Soundtrack is pretty nice to listen to and fits the game quiet nicely
- The Car Selection is awesome. I was already pretty happy with the Car Selection in Dirt Rally 2.9, but they added even more cool and interesting cars.

Now the neutral stuff:
- The career mode bring some fresh air into the rally genre but its not perfect. Many things feel weird and are bugging me, like the Stamina of my Staff for example. They have to work like 1-3 Days in a Week to repair my car and are exhausted after 2-3 weeks. wtf?
- The car Builder is also a very unique and cool idea, but needs a lot of adjustment in the next game. First its very dissapointing that you cant use that car except the carrer mode. Secont i wish there would be other car bodys to choose from. You can select from a wide range of bumbers, spoilers etc. but since the body is the same, the car will always look the same too.
- The livery editor ist very very basic. There are many important tools missing and the decals you can select are very few.

No to the bad stuff:
- There is content from the pass looked behind EA Play. This is the typical horrible stuff EA does and alone because of this the game deserves a thumb down in my opinion
- Missing features for Sim Racers. I know the market is smaller then the players who just play with there controllers. But its still a important Part of a Game like this and its growing. Not having triple Screen, VR and Telemetry Data Support from the start was a huuuge let down. Also there are important options missing, like automatic use of H-Shifter or Sequiential if you use different cars.",1701256238,1701256238,False,4,0,0.506172835826873779,0,True,False,False

Pros:

If you're a fan of rally, or looking to get into it, this game is fantastic. The driving physics are very good, an improvement over Dirt Rally 2.0. The tarmac physics are much better now, which I'm a big fan of. One thing I've noticed is that this game has the best co-driver callouts of any game I've played. They're always spot on which gives me a lot of confidence to push myself harder. I play on a wheel but I've heard others say it's great on controller. 

The campaign is pretty fun, it's very driver focused, and isn't going to waste your time saving up money or grinding to advance. If you're a good driver, your budget will increase fast and you'll make it to the WRC in no time. There's a neat teammate option that allows you to hire another driver and buy them a car to drive alongside you in events. This brings your team more points when competing against big teams like Toyota. 

The locations and stages are beautiful. There are seasons, which allow you to drive in completely different conditions on the same stages. Imagine Monte Carlo, except the snow and ice has mostly melted because it's summer time. Beautiful, twisting tarmac roads, with a gorgeous backdrop of rolling orange hills. It's breathtaking.

And, the stages themselves are so fun to drive. There are some stages that are 30+km! Talk about an endurance test. You really need to play with how far you're willing to push yourself and risk a crash. There's a lot of Y axis movement too, I've noticed a lot of these stages have some very steep sections, you'll have a blast trying to control your car heading downhill or push the power heading uphill. I can tell a lot of work went into making the stages memorable. I haven't found a single location I dislike yet, which was NOT the case for me in other rally games. 

Cons:

The game is pretty heavy, you'll want a powerful PC to run this game smoothly. And you'll want to run this game smoothly, because stuttering can cause you to crash or get a headache. 

One thing I'd really like to see is better spectators. I want to see them cheering and moving more, and being overall more 'alive'. This is very Dirt Rally like, where they just stand there lifelessly on the side. From a competitive standpoint though, they're not distracting. In fact, you don't even notice them. 

The AI also seems really poorly balanced. I'm pretty decent at rally games and have been playing them for years. I often land in the top 5% on global leader boards, and my stage times in time trials are typically very consistent. However, sometimes in the campaign I'll land in 10th place after a clean run, while on other stages I'll gap 2nd place by several minutes (on a single stage!). I've seen others complain about this too, and I didn't have this issue in Dirt Rally 2.0 or other rally games. They definitely need to work on it in my opinion.",1699921123,1701232973,True,0,0,0.524969518184661865,0,True,False,False

Especially the involvement of EA made me worry a bit it would be more like Dirt 4 again, but no … to me, this is a real ""Dirt Rally"", albeit with a much bigger budget. This especially shows in the number of stages and their variety - it feels like visually, they crammed 3 or 4 different rallys in the scope they had in Dirt Rally 2.0 into one rally of WRC - meaning, the landscapes have so many different features that they feel more real than ever before. 

So far, I have only two issues - one is that sometimes, freezes are occuring for half a second or so, and this despite me being on a relatively new PC with a 3080ti. I guess this has something to do with Unreal Engine shader loading. Well, and the other thing is of course that the VR mode is still missing.

This is an example where I would say Steam needs a middle ground for review, neither positive or negative.
There is so much to like about the game, its a good successor to DIRT2.0, although a little less sim in my opinion, which is not a terrible thing, but I do wish they would make it a hardcore sim, with sliders so less sim orientated players could enjoy.

But the current problems with the game (and the reason for the thumbs down);
-> Multiplayer is broken, with stutters and not recording timed stages correctly, on one stage it said i took 108mins to complete, when it actually took 4mins.
-> Not having the game auto switch between Sequential and Manual gears depending on the chosen car and its default, this was in DIRT2.0, not sure why its not in this game, when the historical cars are so fun to drive.
-> Camera position is too low in certain cameras and makes stages with lots of elevation more difficult than it should be, just give me the option to raise the camera height, there are options, but they dont work in all camera modes.
-> Pace notes, are way too late for certain stages and in general are pretty late compared to most recent WRC games. Please increase the earliest calls to be 6-8 corners ahead, in some stages I am already past the braking point for hairpins when the co-driver calls them out.
-> Performance issues, the game should not have been released with this many issues.
-> Stage design, it seems to me that certain countries have been given more time than others, Kenya is amazing with ruts and varying road types, I think this should be carried over to other countries which lack the same feel. Understandably some countries do have smooth roads, but not all of them.

In general I think the game is essentially early access and will hopefully be a much better game in about 6-8 months after patches. But there are also some major gameplay elements which would require much more work.

So for now I would recommend any Rally Fan buy the game, but I cant recommend to non Rally fans.

EDIT: 

After the latest patch, the stuttering initially was worse, until I had to spend a few hours tweaking some settings to allow me to play without the huge amount of stutters, now they are very occasional. However this still requires lots of work to fix, so please dont give up Codies.

A couple of other items have been ""fixed"" or ""tweaked"", still some issues.

But on the whole, I would now recommend this game to all.
Once you fight through the menus to make the game playable for your system, it really is an enjoyable sim-cade Rally Game. Richard Burns or even Dirt 3.0 this is not. But for some fun rally with friends the game does what it says it will do.

I am still hopeful that the game will continue to improve and changes will be made.
This experience however has forced to make the decision to NOT pre purchase any Codemasters (EA Sports) games again. I will wait for the inevitable 6-12 months until the game is polished.",1699961950,1701166655,True,0,0,0.712121248245239258,0,True,False,False

One thing the game needs to recapture from Dirt Rally 2.0 is the 'soul' of the stages. Gone are the broken down rally cars on the side of the road, the crazy crowds, the drones and helicopters capturing your run, and the sense that other rally cars have run the course before you.

[h3] Content [/h3]
Lots of maps with some degree of variety
Lots of cars which I am glad for
Different modes to play (Career, regularity)
I miss the daily/weekly/monthly challenges from DR2 using a random car and random location

[h3] Graphics [/h3]
A little disappointed with the lack of crowd in certain areas
Rain was much better in DR2
Environment was pretty dead, especially Finland, but understandable due to performance concerns
Doors, trunks and engine covers can fly off car
BUT rolling a car results in only minor dents and not as evident cracked windshields as DR2
- Understandable prob due to license partners issues
Loading is faster than DR2
Graphics overall are not bad, but DR2 was better slightly

[h3] Replays [/h3]
Love it when a crash is detected and it switches to onboard cam
Transition between cams are a little weird
Would love to have a seperated trackside and heli cam rather than combined
Co driver and driver expressions are pretty dead
- No reaction to crash unlike DR2
- Co driver's voice while reading notes seem really chill compared to DR2
Please add co driver voice to replays
Like it that you can move the cam in all positions and have photo mode
In DR2, as you progress through as stage, the car gets muddier or sandier.
Cars in EA WRC look really clean after a 7km stage.

[h3] Handling [/h3]
Might be my settings, but collisions dont feel as hard as they should be
- Eg I hit a fence/wall but dont feel anything
Definitely better tarmac handling than DR2, but not perfect

[h3] Disclaimer [/h3]
I have not tried wet conditions yet

What I like: 

-Stages: 18 locations with lots of different stages to run in all weather conditions and all seasons. Some stages are over 30km! The detail is phoenomenal throughout every stage I have run so far. So well done.

-Cars: Great selection of cars. I particularly love the historic content. Would love to see a 1970s Porsche 911 though!

-Physics/FFB: As I said, out of the box, this game will feel pretty nasty (at least it did on my Fanatec DD1), but with admittedly hours of tuning and trial and error, I was able to make it feel amazing particularly on gravel and snow. On tarmac, I get a weird grinding feeling in my wheelbase no matter what settings I run. It is not enough to ruin the experience, but it is annoying. I think overall, the physics and handling are on par if not a step up from DR2. Better out of the box settings or settings tailored to a few of the popular wheelbases would be a help to a lot of players I think. 
Update: Grinding FFB effect on tarmac seems to be gone. 

-Clubs: I am enjoying the ""Clubs"" mode very much. It is fun competing against others in this format especially if you find a host that puts together a great lineup of stages.

-Career Mode: Just starting out in career mode, but it has been fun so far. Tons of stuff to do. It has not gotten boring or repetitive yet!


What I don't like / Bugs and Issues I've encountered:

-Hardcore Damage: It isn't hardcore enough. Too forgiving at most instances and unrealistic. I understand that not everyone wants to use this mode, but that is why it is an option to select not a permanent setting. Give us full RBR like damage to please the hardcore rally fans!

-Graphics: Running an Nvidia 2070 Super at 4k on my PC, I am having stuttering issues seemingly no matter how low my quality settings are or what resolution. In general, I don't feel my frame rate is high enough even in low quality settings, at 1440p or even at 1080p. I still have trouble seeing the road ahead in the twisty bits due to the choppiness of the screen. I know lots of updates are being constantly implemented to help this, so I remain hopeful. It is beautiful when you are sitting still however. 
Update: Graphics have been smoothed out a lot it seems with the 1.0.3 Update!

-Shifter Issue: My Fanatec Clubsport 2.5 shifter (plugged in via USB not through the wheelbase)  has occasional issues where Gears R, 1st, and 2nd all register as reverse when driving even though they are mapped correctly (If I try to remap them, however, 1st, and 2nd still register as R). All shifter functions operate fine in Fanatec Control Panel. Usually a computer restart cures this.

-Pacenotes: There should be an edit function. Have come across several corners that just don't fit the provided pacenote. 

-Water splash: Hitting a water crossing is like hitting a brick wall. The car stops so quickly and almost always stalls no matter what speed you enter the water at. The physics of water crossings could use an update I think.

-Soundtrack: This is totally personal opinion, but the music is awful. I had to turn it off almost immediately.

Dirt rally re-ignited that love of rally games when it came out, and Dirt 2.0 built upon it.

So from the creators of those 2 games that i have played on and off for years and enjoyed every minute of it comes ""EA Sports WRC"". To me, this is Dirt 3.0 (with an official license)!

And when it comes to the rubber meets the gravel, its there. Grabbing the wheel and fighting your way thru the various stages this game is so fun you almost, but just almost for a moment forget and forgive the not so great parts of this game. If you played Dirt 2.0, it feels familiar, but better.

So, the driving feeling is there, BUT...?

Personally, i am not the player that cares about Time Trial or stuff like that. The experience i want is basically what i got in 2.0. Singleplayer fun, having close fights with AI times that hit the sweet spot with my skill level, so its competetive in every rally. Dirt 2.0 hit that sweet spot, once far enough up the difficulty ladder there, you hit a ""soft"" wall where you needed to put some effort into getting better to be able to win (based on your skill level ofcourse). Another upside to Rally games is that you do not have to bother with poor AI on the track with you ruining you experience, you only compete with times. And those times could be pulled from a spreadsheet for all i care, as long as it gives me a challenge and goal to chase. I also did not mind being mid-pack when i hit a difficulty level, it just meant i had room to improve, learn and get better.

So, it all sounds kinda dandy, what's the catch, why do i rate this game as negative in my review?

#1 The elephant in the room.. Performance..

I have been ""lucky"" and i have not had any major performance issues besides the famous ""stutter"". Which is bad enough really, when you play a game that practically demands 110% of your focus, a poorly timed stutter can be really annoying, but nothing gamebraking.

#2 AI bugs/inconsistecny

The fact that the AI totally bugs out and randomly set times minutes below what you would expect is the real killer. That is the thing that really ruins my experience. First, it's impossible for me to tune the difficulty to something that is to my liking, since i will never know if these times i see are the cause of a bug or not. Making career and season totally unplayable really. AI also seems to be on steroids when doing part unlock rallies, During my first JWRC career, i practically won most rallies, but did not even come close to unlocking the parts on the same difficulty. How much the bugged AI affected this, i do not know ofcourse.

#3 Season repeats

Finishing the first career season, i did not fill the bar enough to progress (how this worked was poorly explained as well). So i had to do another season in JWRC, no problems, i get to drive more, practice and have fun and then go to WRC2 next season then! At the end of the first Rally, it struck me, i was running an EXACT copy of last season, down to the weather! I mean, come on! DR2.0's randomly generated seasons was at least doing some randomization. I can run any rally with the exact same stages in the same order, but if at the very least the weather was randomized there would be a ""fresh"" feeling to it. You are in the same place, but at a different time, but the challenge is different..

#4 Damage system/immovable objects

The damage system is too forgiving, you can abuse the hell out the of cars on a stage and you get no real damage. Misjudging a corner and slamming the front of the car into a concrete pillar should punish you, here, you just need replace some plastic bodyparts and job done!. I would have to actually TRY to get any kind of terminal damage in this game. Rally is risk vs. reward. You want to push hard for a win? Go for it, but the risk is that you push too hard, and damage the car while doing so, which will leave you with a wounded car until next service.

Another very annoying thing is the small objects that stops you dead in your tracks if you hit them, standard roadsign posts comes to mind. If you were to hit one of those at 80km/h, they would bend, you would run over them and potentially damaging your car. Here, it is like hitting a concrete wall, but you get almost no damage tho. Immersion killer and annoying.

TLDR: The core of the game is good, the driving, Other areas are in need of improvement

This review will be changed when the game is patched up to a state where it works as it should. It feels like a rush job to meet a deadline, the game is not done yet, but we ship it anyway. The EA way. The cynic in me tells me the fixes that will make this game complete and better will be called ""EA sports WRC 2024"" and will come with  a AA price tag. I hope i am wrong of course, but if that is the case, Do not expect me to open up my wallet..

⚙️ [b]PERFORMANCE:[/b]
To start with the worst, performance issues greatly ruin the overall experience of the game. I'm experiencing [u]stuttering and sudden fps drops[/u], even though my GPU and CPU is not fully used. Game is running on [u]Unreal Engine 4[/u] and some elements has impact on engine performance. It took me hours experimenting with the settings (sometimes still trying new combinations) to reach stable 60 - 75 FPS in most tracks. Especially lights during night stages are very laggy, solution is to not use lights at all and tweak brightness. The release was obviously rushed and we need to wait until these issues will be fixed.

🎮 [b]GAMEPLAY/PHYSICS:[/b]
Physics model received mixed feedback, mostly by misunderstanding the game genre. To clarify - people expected Dirt Rally 3.0 or RBR competitor, which is not what WRC franchise was last years. EA WRC follows the [i]arcadish[/i] route, but significantly improves it, I would call it like [u]Medium Semi-Sim[/u]. Although my first impressions were negative and expected something else, I consider it as positive decision. Codies have created an entry point for people, who have never tried rally games. You don't need a steering wheel or experience from other rally games, EA WRC is beginner-friendly rally title.

To characterize the physical model, I completed nearly 85% of available roads. In many cases is better to flatout than try driving at half throttle. The game rewards you when you try to push and that feels great. FWD are understeering, RWD oversteering and AWD is somewhere between, nothing to add here. Faster cars feels more gripy than the slower cars, which confirms my point I mentioned. Tuning could significantly change the car behavior and it's not that hard to understand it. It's mostly consistent across majority of the cars and game tells you what the parts does and why. Surfaces met my expectations, I immediately recognize what am I driving on and it's characteristics are predictable. There's minor difference between dry and wet surfaces, mainly in grip and responsivity, and seasons (except for Winter on some locations) does cosmetics only.

I'm happy to say game is pretty solid with great handling. I can even say handling is pretty controller friendly too which i am really happy about. Even one of my friend plays with a keyboard so it is keyboard friendly too i guess? Asphalt handling feels great and some asphalt stages are a joy to drive on (esp Japan stages are a delight). 

Game's performance is relatively nice too with some stutters here and there. I didn't experience that much stutter in low setting in my gtx 1060 and i3 9100f but some people say it is really bad so beware. I have some problems in car liverys which the rally sticker stretches out or something but its not that big of a problem.

Lastly and i think this is the only critism i can think of right now. I think the career mode is kind of half baked with some basic things like managing the budget, making sponsors happy etc. i have yet to build my own car and competing in it though. That might make things more challenging. Also my friend who also played WRC Generations says the damage system (especially tires) and career mode is much better. So keep those in mind.

Overall great rally game with awesome handling, car roster and stages but not so great in career mode aspect and maybe perfomance in some people.

First of all, I recommend you download a mod to fix auto exposure. Otherwise daytime tracks will keep flashbanging you. The game is a bit of an eyesore when it comes to lighting overall, but overly shiny surfaces, mostly the roads in the Mexico stages are the worst offenders. 
I've seen screenshots people made where the game is all black at night, only the ui and the sky are visible. Something about this game engine is fundamentally broken and will never be fixed. (I've read this has been an issue with previous games already, no improvements were made.)

After that if you're on an AMD card, make sure FSR is disabled. It's supposed to help with performance but it causes massive shuttering and weird pop in errors. My framerate literally doubled once I've disabled it.

Something I'm yet to solve is small flashing black artifacting on the road. The frequency varies between a few times a minute and a few times a second so it's very distracting. 

For reference I play on an RTX 7900XTX, with the latest drivers.

Technical problems aside, the driving is fun. No idea how realistic it is, never driven a rally car in my life. There are countless tracks and cars that handle differently. Damage model is very forgiving, I've hit rocks at 150km/h and got away with a puncture. The visuals would be great if not for the lighting problems listed above. Everything looks too high-contrast.

The game has adjustable abs and traction control sliders, so it's good for beginners as well. I mostly play Assetto Corsa so rallying is far from what I'm familiar with, but this game feels forgiving yet challenging enough to keep me entertained.

So many inconsistencies, from map design like roads being either too perfect, flat or like they were modeled by hand with the editor quickly to raise them and make them in a ruff shapes resambling hill or cliff which looks like cryeditor quick paint bursh thing, to lazy put texture patterns in lowe resolution and pasting and model of trees pasted with slight rotation and size variation, things look like the game is from 2016, as someone else said it feels exactly like procedural generated levels just because how long they are and the work it was going to take them to make them ""believable"" otherwise. 

No to speak about this sky of abomination, static picture of sky with water effect on it, on night sky, it looks there are noise in the sky like taken photo from a poor quality phone in a night time and zoomed in, there like dark watery spots everywhere...

Gameplay is fine, as with keyboard, joystick and a wheel, but car animaitons behaves weird on rotation, the car has like weird auto weight to keep it not turning upside down, like someone phisically holds the car in weird phisic positions and puts it back on track.

So many things that they could have made better... I was looking sooo forward for this ""Next Gen Only"" title.... , some day, maybe someday they will stop pushing devs to do what they need time to do and we will have a great game.

Even after all this rant, I am still optimistic and am recommending this game as VR is coming and I am looking for this to redeem this mix of feeling mess of a game.

The game has improved since release, namely the performance issues and timing of co-driver instructions. Imo, this game expands on the DiRT Rally games and makes the career more engaging. While the benefactor system is a bit annoying in that it limits the cars you can get to a set budget and doesn't allow you to collect like previous games, it does make participating in different events important. Asphalt driving is way better than previous DiRT games which is great since many of the rallies are tarmac focused.

It works as if the traction circle were elongated from front to back on each wheels. It feels like longitudinal grip is artificially enhanced when slip angle is low. It's causing too much force from accelerating/braking in straight (I can hardly feel the wheels locking up.) and excessive over/understeer in corners. 

I mean, there's gotta be something wrong when you your 500hp+ WRC1 monster never having a wheelspin launching or stalls from engaging 1st at rev limit going 60km/h in reverse, ON ANY SURFACES. Where has all the power gone to?

DR2.0 always felt slippy but it were consistent on it's account, EAWRC on the other hand, it is all over the place. When you slide you will lose traction in weird way but even worse the car loves to stall while at it. It doesn't make much sense at this moment.

If this problem is solved, it has a potential of being THE Rally game. It has a good variety of locations, many longer stages and car selection is good. Call out was better in DR2.0 but that is a smaller issue.

Is this game good as long as you don't expect a hardcore sim? YES.
This game feels a bit like Dirt 5's rally track difficulty with Dirt Rally's physics.
Basically the stages feel easier to drive, but the cars still require skill.
In my opinion this is the perfect mix and is exactly what i wanted.
I always felt the Dirt games were a bit too arcade focused on weird stuff. I just wanted to play Dirt but only do the rally stages and ignore the rest of the racing types.
This basically feels exactly like that. Except it does have the Dirt Rally style physics which are a lot more unforgiving compared to the normal Dirt games.
Playing this on a controller is a dream. I play 1st person cockpit view and the steering animations are very good. Usually steering animations for controller players look very jerky and un-natural, but not here. Love it.
Graphics are... okay. Acceptable. Honestly I think the graphics are good EXCEPT the lighting is too bright during the day. It often washes the scene out and turning down the contrast in game doesn't really help the issue. 
Career is so far very fun and engaging. I've really enjoyed playing through the different types of cars and stages and managing my team. 
Making a custom car is a cool idea, though personally i think all of them are ugly and end up just using the real cars instead.
I know a lot of others are dissapointed in the release and i had very little faith when i heard EA was taking over... but honestly? Much better than expected in my opinion.

This review is after a 3 hour play-through so keep that in mind. 


I've personally had some major graphics and framerate issues with this one, on all settings somethings always just not been quite right. 

The game benefits from having the licensing as well as great stages that comes with it. It offers a great selection of cars to choose from. 

While it has customisation options the UI is considerably limited in comparison to previous WRC titles. You can't create a vehicle that its truly and uniquely yours in terms of livery when they dont give you the tools to get creative, its almost like thye dont want you to come up with anything too original.

Visuals are nice but it adds nothing to the experience if the game play is not up to the mark. Whatever EA touches seems to go down the drain very fast. There is no effort in terms of optimization. Does not matter whether you play in low or high setting, there are stutters any which way. The stutters are so frequent that a good drive is easily thrown away. Long stages are good but again has no meaning when the game optimization is so bad that you are sure to crash because of the stutters.

Unfortunately the list what i don't like much longer:
- The game has funny physics, the grip mechanism feels buggy, you can get insane grip while transferring the weight from one side to another. This can be felt most easily with counter steering. With a little practice you can use that to turn hard on ice with slick tires. The grip too much on gravel and snow, the cars should be more ""understeery"" especially when you release the throttle, it behaves like I do trailbraking. When the front tyres are slipping the car shouldn't turn, or at least not that much. The understeer happens only when I step on the throttle at mid corner, where it shouldn't be, due to the differentials in the WRC cars they should do the opposite. The snow piles are too firm, this could be done better in 2023.
Overall the WRC cars feels much better in the game, but the rest of the cars are not even close how they should behave.
- I don't know why, but i can't get over 85 fps, while my gpu is on 60% usage and my cpu core usage under 70% (average core usage 20%) (5800X3D + 3080)
- The default terrible stutter. At least that can be resolved by limiting the fps in the VGA driver.
Edit: Okay i found it at last, the performance problem due to this:
https://answers.ea.com/t5/Bug-Reports/Fanatec-ClubSport-v3-bug/m-p/13182264/highlight/false#M1409
That hurts..

- The co-pilot speaks as if he were talking about the weather, completely ignoring attention-grabbing intonation. It's hard to keep up the focus on the pacenotes like this.

In general, I did not expect much more from the game, if it will be able to use my hardware, then I will be satisfied.

Edit2:
11 days passed after the release, the multiple USB input device bug still not solved, still can't play properly due to low fps... My 20 hours of gameplay passed by FFB configuration, thanks for this beautiful opportunity, but would prefer playing now... Come on EA, get your ""heck"" together!

Edit3:
3 weeks passed after the release, the game is still unplayable on my hardware due to the Fanatec V3 pedals.
Disconnecting the pedals removes the 85FPS limit, but it still bottlenecks one thread on the CPU around 120 fps resulting occasional stutters at the worst moments. The rest of the threads are not used more than 20%.
The worst optimization of the decade, I've never imagined that my X3D CPU will be bottlenecked by a rally game.

A 7/10 at best though. Lots of :/ Dirt Rally went bad after the pleasant surprise of the first one.

Physics are okay on gravel, apart from the somewhat fake loss of all grip at times (and just ploughing straight off the track) when the game decides that you're entering a corner too fast - particularly on tarmac (which is also where the physics seem underdeveloped, like having flashbacks of tarmac stages from really old games). Some cars feel absolutely awful on asphalt - the others just feel poor.

AI is often too weak usually on 100% difficulty - same as Dirt Rally - but sometimes overly strong it seems.. they're inconsistent. AI is also really basic and often has only trashed tyres left several stages before the finish. They aren't immersive. Intentionally and not, pace notes are often of poor accuracy. Like some of the challenge and longevity of the game is about having to memorise and allow for such things; it can get pretty irritating, not being able to trust your co-driver.

Car builder is just 3 different cars with a few very small choices. Seems like an empty feature to me. Livery creator is very limited (and only fictional sponsers allowed), makes me not want to create my own. Career mode is alright (pretty crap in some ways.. like each season championships use like the same 5 events even though the game contains many more) - though even the ""long rally"" career setting doesn't seem to include the longest stages :/ I'm hoping an ""extra long rally"" option appears at some point.

Stages are alright, though with the usual heavy re-usage within events and different stages (I'm not a huge fan of how many stages are a constant twisty mess though). E.g. long stages are shorter stages stuck together. Although degraded stages have an overly exaggerated bumpiness that's a bit clumsy and stupid - and snow banks turn into frozen rocks on degraded snow tracks (where they were very soft before).

Graphics are somewhat underwhelming. The rainfall effect is one of the worst I've ever seen in any generation - as is the snow, it looks glitched. Snow has a ridiculous looking sparkle effect (thankfully not visible when in the cockpit at least) that's not even attached to the snow. Some pauses while driving, which will hopefully be fixed soon (some seem connected to loading sound effects even). Performance is barely acceptable on my 4090 with DLSS enabled and a bunch of settings turned down. Frame rate seems to go down when actually going fast.

Works well at 32:9 with reduced FoV - but replay cameras lack a FoV option, meaning replays look pretty bad with really high distortion.

Not the next gen Dirt Rally many were hoping for, and there are plenty of signs of some clumsy, uninspired and rushed development. I hope the next WRC game is a good improvement. Better physics, graphics, more individual stages and replays - and a lot more polish. So I'm effectively wishing for some of the dev team to be fired and replaced with people who aren't crap at this.

Dirt 2.0 with 2023 rally cars and with the WRC lineup
Wish I had a rally school to start my Rally sim adventure, glad its here for the new players

Eh(dont care about could live with or without)
the pre rally announcers
wish they gave you the preorder liveries for the builder car
 
Cons:
no Rallycross (maybe Wrc had a problem with it but I mean its FIA associated)
Missing the Central Euro rally (they said it will be a free update)
EA Play Exclusive Moments
wish you could make a Sedan in car builder and not just a hatchback

I wish they looked at WRC 9,10,Gen for inspiration when making this game:
Co-driver should of been added, was the best multiplayer experience for any rally game
you cant time attack the Circuit stages like you could in WRC gen
instead of getting tires by the set you can have setups like (I want 6 rain tires and 4 soft and 8 medium tires)
and being able to replace a car that has tires at 60,70,90,90% and only replace the 60 and 70

However, this time I have to be that person.
The game overall is good. You'll have fun when you've played the DiRT Rally games or even the previous WRC games.
Compared to the WRC games it's an absolute upgrade in every aspect.
But compared to DiRT Rally 2.0 there aren't enough upgrades compared to the downgrades. You get a lot what you didn't have in the DiRT Rally series: For example creating your own car, a career, very nice and long challenging stages and many other game modes.
But the typical daily/weekly/monthy online challenges are missing. You have to go the workaround and use the so called 'Clubs'.
Also the physics aren't absolutly bad, but a little worse than DiRT Rally in my opinion.
Same with the performance. It looks worse than DiRT Rally but the performance is worse too. If the game looks worse than an older game I expect at least higher fps. But that's not the case.
[b] And my last point are the immovable objects. Sure, big trees or houses don't move when you crash into them. But the smallest street sign or the thinnest sticks don't break or move when you drive into them. So expect the smallest street sign to wreck your whole car and ruin your stage when hitting it with 200 km/h. You'll come to an absolute hold the second you touch it. When at least the immovable onjects get fixed, I'll change the review to a thumb up. [/b]",1700762168,1700762211,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

More depth in career mode, cars feel better, asphalt handling is definitely improved / more faithful. Main performance issues were fixed a few days after release (annoying, I know, but they're pretty fine now).

I have a RTX 4060 Ti pushing a 3440x1440 monitor and am running with DLSS on, which helps a lot. Like in Dirt Rally 2.0, I have crowds turned entirely off. Usually my frames don't dip below 120 and the game feels relatively smooth, with only a few sections of maps dipping to 60-80fps (which seems to be from the game loading assets more than anything, but that's just a feeling).

If you have an AMD graphics card, you might want to wait for some more optimization updates, but any RTX-anything should be able to run this game just fine.

Hybrid cars are cool. The hybrid system/rules feel really weird to me still, and I am only just starting to feel like I'm figuring out what to do with them / when they can be used. I have no idea how these hybrid cars work in real life / what the race rules are for them, but it's very easy to accidentally lose battery charge while transitioning from gas to braking and vice versa. I have to drive with one foot to avoid doing that or add huge deadzones to my gas and brake pedals, and then it's fine.

Also, it should be a no-brainer, but they seem to have first-class support for the (now somewhat old) Logitech G27 racing wheel I have. I've played racing games that have made it really annoying to configure that wheel / not have a built-in preset for it, but it was ready to go out of the box. Also, I have no idea if this actually happened, but it seems like all my controls presets from Dirt Rally 2.0 got carried over (handbrake button, windshield wipers, lights) automatically, which is really nice if that was actually the case. First racing game I've played where I could plug-and-play my racing wheel.


There have been a few little quality-of-life downgrades from Dirt Rally 2.0 which, while small, are encountered frequently:

First off, you don't get a confirmation box if you try to start a stage from the service area without having swapped tires or done repairs. I have run so many stages on absolutely destroyed soft tires at this point and I still make that mistake. There isn't even a red dot or anything to call attention to that (nested) menu that you most certainly should be checking at every service.

Second (and other reviews have mentioned this) there's no way to have your transmission and clutch mode auto-match the current car. If I'm driving bae (Lancia Stratos), I want to use a stick with normal clutch, but if I'm driving a WRC car, I know it's a sequential grip shifter with a clutch override. I have to change it for every race, which only takes a moment, but it would be so nice to get that setting back.

Third, there just aren't a lot of explainer / infobox things to understand how things are connected in the game, what icons mean what (see: career mode), etc. The rally school is nice for some basic technique, but understanding service area stuff can be a struggle sometimes. For example, on the damage categories, it would be so nice to have some more info on how to reduce that kind of damage. I was confused on why I was constantly getting exhaust damage, even when driving (mostly) clean lines, and someone suggested raising the suspension height. That was a bit of a [duh] moment but also it's not something I've encountered before.

All in all, if you liked Dirt Rally 2.0, this is that but gooder. I'm hoping the seasonal/paid stuff doesn't drive this game into the ground, and instead it becomes something I can enjoy for a long time like Dirt Rally 2.0.

The online/multiplayer feels a bit like an afterthought at the moment, but there is room to add features and polish if the devs are able. The Single Player career however, is well fleshed out and appears to have enough depth to entertain for more than one in-game season of rally. The AI competitors do have their issues (overall pace, getting stuck, etc) however the 1.3 was an improvement from my limited experience so far.

This game is good (once they fix it) if you're looking for a casual rally sim.

But it is NOT Realistic, and anybody that has played Richard Burns Rally ( A far far far superior product, which is free btw), will not like it.  I've played RBR, and therefore this game is not good. Play RBR instead. 

More details:
At the moment, it's borderline unplayable on my 4090 GPU. Also it sounds terrible. Dirt Rally 2.0 is one of the best sounding racing games of all time along with Horizon 5. And yet, the same studio produced this garbage product. Probably wanted to keep the game size down, but still, it sounds terrible.

Force feedback is improved, Tarmac is improved (though still not realistic, just like the whole game in general), and the call-outs are EXCELLENT. I miss the voice that changes depending on your driving from DR2, but my God. The callouts in this game are literal perfection, if you crash, it's your fault. The Co-Driver literally tells you everything, and in my short experience all the turns are accurate. I haven't made up my mind as to refund the game or not, but overall I don't recommend this game. WHY BUY THIS WHEN YOU CAN DOWNLOAD RBR FOR FREE!!?? Like I said at the beginning, it's a casual game, for casuals. Don't try to go rallying in your car after playing this game, cars don't behave like this in real life. The physics don't even simulate the tires actually being on the ground.",1700690403,1700690403,False,3,0,0.519428014755249023,0,True,False,False

Codemasters was purchased by EA for a cool $1.2 billion.

They are not connected in any other way. So, in effect, this is DiRT Rally 3, but officially licensed.

That said, there isn't a ton to say regarding the game as a whole. It has a decent career mode with crew management and benefactor appeasement which will affect your available budget both positively and negatively. The physics are drastically improved, wholesale. The older WRC titles felt floaty, and as though your tires were covered in soap. DiRT Rally 2 had a number of issues where a lot of the surfaces didn't actually feel much different, that isn't the case here.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3090942057

The one issue I have with this game is that EA decided to not include Dailies, Weeklies or Monthlies. Arguably one of the most popular features in DiRT Rally 2. Instead featuring “Moments” — either based on real historical rally races, inspired by, or literal historic races. Some of these moments will have secondary an tertiary objectives to fulfill. And these will run for about 6 weeks (at least at the time of writing this) with a leaderboard. Some are locked behind an EA Play subscription.

I found that the Quick Generate Championship option under quickplay to be a decent supplement for my desire for new dailies/weeklies. It will randomly select a location, stages, a class of car and this, in effect, can satisfy your desire to simply “jump in”.

There will be 'seasons' of content planned, I used to be very against this sort of thing. But it's just a reality of, not only the game industry, but where we are as an entertainment medium. Games cost a lot of money to develop and it seems like people just have less time — in general. The only way companies can keep costs relatively low and approachable for the average consumer is to elongate the “window” where people are playing — which is subsequently why we see the rise of Free to Play models. Very few people would be willing to pay $100 or $120 for a new game. But $60 and then $30 in 2 months for a big expansion, and another $30 for a some random cosmetics a few months after that, that's seems to be fine for the average person. And that's been the paradigm shift.

[h3]The Gist[/h3]
This package feels a bit bare bones right now, but it'll get more added to it over time. I know many don't like EA. However, there are numerous companies that do much worse than them and it really feels like it's just popular to hate on EA without any real reason.

The tracks are great, the physics are great. If you feel apprehensive or don't trust EA, just wait.

Handing is solid, not fully realistic but not arcadey either. In between, could even say that it's closer to simulation handling than to arcade. Basically it has a bit more grip than what it should be, I feel like. Just a bit. I have switched between playing this game and playing Richard Burns Rally (which is considered more of a simulator) and the skills transfer between the two quite smoothly. I play with a wheel, don't have an opinion with a controller.

Game had stuttering at launch but the patches fixed it for me.

Lots of content, plenty of stages. Supposedly the European Central Rally will release in an update. All the rest of the official WRC locations are there, plus 5 unofficial ones. At the time of the review there is no VR support and no true triple screen support (only ultrawide stretched). They did mention they will release those features sometime in the future.

Currently the AI is all over the place. You can run a stage fine without any blunders and be +10 seconds from the rest of the field, and run the next stage with the same performance and be a minute behind everybody else. This makes career more and championship mode frustrating and unplayable in my case. What I currently play are the ""moments"" (which are daily stages) and ""clubs"" (custom tournaments) in which you compete with other players' times. It would be nice if it showed the percentile of where you are at the ranks. If you are rank 400 in the leaderboard out of 5000 players then that's good, but if you are rank 100 out of 150 players then that's not as good. No way to tell currently.
There is also online live play where you play at a lobby and everybody races the same stage at the same time, with live update on positions on the HUD. Quite fun and an interesting way to play rally online.

The graphics are pretty good, not perfect next-gen but next-genish. There are moments where it looks amazing, especially with at dawn/dusk where the sun gives good lighting. The photo mode is very cool and I have seen amazing shots posted at forums. Would be nice if there was some more ""life"" or movement in the stages let's say: birds on the road or a jumping animal, maybe a fan or a photographer is on the road and jumps back up when they see you coming (like in richard burns rally) etc. 

The sound of the cars is phenomenal, so satisfying. The amount of cars is also impressive, it basically has everything from new to kinda new to kinda old to old.

There are a couple of issues with the games performance but you can manage to get decent FPS from the hood cam. I can't have my usb hub plugged in at the same time as playing this game because it drops my FPS by about half. But I do have hopes they manage to sort out the issues with this game.

Singleplayer career can be a bit ruined by the AI at times. Sometimes the AI are just completely and suddenly off the ball on the last stages (I am playing at 95 AI level) and I gain 1-2 minutes per stage.

The game itself runs great on my machine, I don't experience any of the stuttering. It also looks really good and overall feels great. It demands a lot of focus and requires quite some learning I think. It makes me want to play more and try to compete with other players.

However.. as I don't have a wheel + pedals / simrig, I'm playing with a gamepad. The gamepad integration is good I guess, at least in terms of functionality. It feels though as if the game was designed with a simrig in mind as the steering with gamepad becomes _really_ frustrating. Sometimes the joystick inputs make the vehicle steer just perfectly, and other times the slightest input causes an oversteer which you cannot catch and control anymore - on the same vehicle, same stage, same corner.

The Game Play
I'm enjoying it in my sim rig. Would be nice to play it leisurely on my Steam Deck, but that's ok. The tracks are enjoyable and the play modes keep it interesting. I'm happy enough with the physics so far. They had some stuttering bugs at launch but already polished most of that out. It would be nice to have better triple screen support, but most to all the existing rally games don't have great support for it either, so can't really complain to much about that, I guess. 


The Brand
It's pretty wild to think of all the facets put together to give us this one. Dirt, Code Masters, WRC FIA, all roofed under our favorite publisher, EA. That last part leaves a sour taste in my mouth, but we really have to commit towards their own commitment and so far they are asking a fair price for a lot of game.

We are sure to see it repackaged and rebranded next year, but each installment is going to add to the experience. Driving sims need continued support to ever have the chance of becoming decent and so I'm fine with that.",1700668398,1700668398,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Game is an upgrade from Dirt 2.0, something i'd assume was Codemasters goal.
So far i was able to test a few cars, mainly current gen WRC:
First of all, had to max my sens in order for the cars to feel responsive. They felt too heavy with default sensitivity.
Asphalt is kinda weird, might be due to high sens like mentioned previously, cars feel twitchy and grip is very sudden like, you could be mid-corner and feel nothing but then make a small adjustment and get this feeling of the car being on rails and hit a wall.
Gravel and dirt have never felt this good, the hybrid system makes for some crazy moments, it's like you're in an F1 car for 2s.
Over 30km stages are huge for the game, tried Pulperia (Chile, longest stage in the game) and i gotta say, going uphill and downhill for over 25 minutes is something everyone should experience at one point. Can't speak for wheel users but as a controller player i can say my fingers were done after 15-17 minutes.
Game is great, you need a pretty powerfull CPU to run it tho, my GPU (3060Ti) was chilling around 50% usage on high settings. I have a Ryzen 5 5600 and was getting some stutters here and there but nothing game ruining or anything.
Would recommend, kinda similar to Dirt Rally 2.0 but overall better.

* Handling model
* Good stages and seasons for each rally
* Great car list
* Variety of game modes
* Lively Multiplayer
* Plenty of content for the price

Cons:
* Graphics
* Performance
* Load times

Games handling model is easy to pick up yet detailed and it feels right. Cars are controllable, agile and feel powerful. It is easy to steer with throttle. Handling can be modified quite a bit with 5 assists all with 5 stages. All of them turned on will drive closer to WRC9 game, while everything off will feel closer to Dirt Rally 2, but improved. Even with everything off, car will feel very much in control. Car's weight shifting makes sense and is predictable. You won't get many nasty surprises from the car if you know what you are doing. Handling on tarmac stages is improved since DR2.

Game has very good Stages. You will be able to visit not only the rallies, that are on 2023 calendar, but other locations from the past. All rallies you can drive in different seasons as well, providing even more replayability. Where KT's WRC locations shared a lot of assets, each location in this game feels unique and you can immediately tell it apart, by the road, scenery, things around. Locations have similar feel to real WRC onboards. Also, no more 2 minute stages that DR2 had. Now most stages will take 6-15 minutes and will give you more immersive rally experience. 

Car selection is spot on. You will get to drive all the usual suspects and more rare classic cars, you don't encounter much in other games. And if the rich car list is not enough for you, you can build your own. Game allows you to put together your own car models from preset pieces and use them in all game modes, then make your own liveries for them. But considering how many great official cars already are there, I didn't find myself using custom cars much.

Game has many game modes. Career, custom championships, multiplayer, real life WRC moments you can replay in game, time trials and even rally driving lessons. Rally lessons will ease you in off-road racing if you are new to WRC games. Career mode is very similar to KT's games. It has a calendar, where you have to choose which activity to do each week. Manage your engineers, buy cars and upgrade some passive stats.

Performance is not so good. It is not the best looking racing game and it's optimization is pretty bad as well. Which might be down to this being first Unreal Engine game for CM. Stage loading also take a while even on fast SSD.  

Season pass you can ignore. It only contains few driver outfits that you will not see most of the time anyway. EA will try to push their EA access service in your face in season pass and in moments game mode, which can be annoying. Other than that, I haven't found any other MTXs. And for the amount of content you get in this game full price seems fair. 

Overall EA WRC have some Richard Burns Rally vibes. Gameplay wise it is a very good rally game. It falls short technically and knowing EA, there's small chance that it will be fixed. CM probably already are working on next years version. So if that is a dealbraker for you, I would not suggest this game. But if graphics is not a selling point for you, you might find lot's of enjoyment here. This is very good base with room for improvement for upcoming titles. If CM keeps going in the right direction this new rally series could become one of the more popular racing games series, just like CM's F1 games.
Whether you are rallying veteran or new WRC fan, you will find lots of fun content in this game. Cars handle just as they should, handling model is very good. Honestly, it is much better than I expected.",1699017697,1700638447,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Codemasters and EA have shown promise of dedication to the upkeep of the game with a couple of patches that have fixed the game from its Day 1 kinks in less than a week from public launch, and excellent community support.

With over 13 rallies featuring stages up to around 30km long, there is plenty of fun to be had in cars ranging from WRC 1 to Group B monsters to the humble beginnings of the World Rally Championship, paying homage to decades of history in the sport.

There can still be a few hitches on a couple of stages, but as witnessed, in due time, they will be fixed. Apart from that, it is an excellent game to kick off the new era of officially licensed FIA: World Rally Championship games! 9/10",1700632808,1700632808,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

However, I have to say that so far I've been pleasantly surprised. The handling physics feel nice and responsive, building on what they had going with DR2 - asphalt has seen a definite improvement. 
The audio is superb, which is awesome to see carried over from DR2. Always hated the audio quality in previous WRC games.

Performance:
I'm running a R5 7600 and RTX 3070 Ti using DLSS Quality @ 1440p on high settings and no major issues or crashes yet with solid 100+ FPS.
I have been getting occasional stutters, this happens once or twice per track where it seems to stutter for about 5-10ms. I understand the devs are aware of it, so it should be patched soon. Honestly wouldn't be surprised if it was something to do with Denuvo.

Content:
The variety of tracks and complexity is definitely on a different level to DR2. You can really tell the devs put a lot of effort into the tracks. It feels like each object interacts realistically with the car and gives you that sense of immersion.
Personally I'm not impressed with the builder mode or livery editor, however it may appeal to some.
I haven't played the campaign mode much as of writing, but so far it looks to be a promising evolution from previous WRC titles.

Of course, EA had to add some of their cash grabbing schemes into it. There's ""Moments"" tracks that are locked behind an EA Play paywall.
However, this is the only thing (apart from the Season Rally Passes with cosmetics, etc.) that appears to be locked behind a paywall.

There is an annoying bug that causes all saved tuning to be reset with all sliders to the left. For a rally game where this is core functionality, this needs to be addressed ASAP.
We also need Steam Workshop functionality for tunes!

Overall I'd give the gameplay itself a 9/10. Definitely worth it if you are in to sim racing.

[h1]Pros[/h1]
* Large quantity of locations, with long stages, massively increasing the amount of playtime before you memorize all the stages.
* Excellent stage design. Every location feels authentic and real, partially because they're all real roads, and many of them are real WRC stages too. The sections that cut through villages are some of the best parts.
* A large selection of cars from across the eras.
* Amazing sound design.
* Good physics and handling. While not necessarily superior to RBR in terms of gravel, and other traditional racing sims have the advantage in terms of tarmac realism, EA WRC is still close enough and better than all the other modern rally alternatives.

[h1]Cons[/h1]
* Performance is not great. Despite the latest patch that fixed the major stutters, this game is still nowhere near able to take advantage of my GPU. Regardless of the graphics settings I use it is stuck at around 60 to 70 fps on my 4K 144Hz display. GPU usage never approaches 100% even at max settings. There is definitely a CPU bottleneck.
* Lots of bugs. Club repair exploit still exists. Career AI difficulty gets reset if you take a break mid-event.
* Still many places where you can easily go off the road and get DNF'd for the car being unrecoverable, even if you can clearly see a way to drive back onto the road. I'd personally they'd rather just disable the ability to reset to track in those situations, but leave the choice to retire up to you.
* Career is the same calendar of events every season, with the exact same combination of stages for each event. At least spice it up a bit with some randomness!
* No ability to have the game automatically select between H-Pattern and Sequential based on the car. This existed in prior Codemasters rally titles, so this is a clear downgrade.

The physics on all surfaces feel great in my opinion (with absolutely zero knowledge of how a real rally car handles, like 99% of other reviewers), with each providing their own challenge and feel. The stages have decent scenery, but to be honest they're way to hectic and fun to be paying attention. I can't exactly narrow down what it is, but they feel even more fun and engaging than the older Rally titles. The car sounds are decent; I can't say I've noticed that much of a difference from DR2.0, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. I quite like the menu music too, very much giving me Dirt 4 and Dirt Rally vibes which I like.

Of course, it's not perfect. I think it's actually too forgiving, which I am thankful for, but can take away from the experience. I have had quite a few moments where I've tapped a wall or a rock in a way that would probably kill me IRL, but the car just moves slightly on the track and continues as if nothing happened. The damage model also seems quite basic, but that could be partly due to my fairly low graphics settings. There are also definitely some performance issues, which is probably detailed in 90% of the negative reviews, but I haven't found them to be too terrible. I personally think the graphics are a bit lack-lustre when compared to DR2.0 (I'm running a 1070 so fairly old but still DR2.0 looks a lot better on the same card), but these are both issues that can and hopefully will be fixed in the future.

Overall, as a rally fan, I think the game is definitely worth the price, just for the amount of content and gameplay quality alone. It's a shame that it's released in a laggy state, something that is happening way too much with games nowadays, but I'm really excited to see how this game develops, hopefully by first fixing the issues, and then somehow adding even more content (new cars, tracks, rallycross?).",1699030615,1700601827,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First it used to happen when you first go to a track after launching the game and then it didn't happen again. Now it happens even after a longer session.

     While Unreal engine 5 makes this game visually stunning, it seems to have had a couple minor issues at launch concerning some stuttering or flickering (something to deal with compiling shaders). As this is upon release this is expected, and with EA $$$$ behind this game things should get fixed soon. With a powerful enough system, the game is entirely playable right now with only minor hiccups.

WRC is fun out of the box. The physics are good enough and great fun, as is the FFB (on a Fanatec CSL DD 8nm). There is also plenty of game to keep you occupied, with career, championships, time trials, moments, etc. The WRC courses are long, varied and challenging.

I've played quite a bit of dirt rally and dirt rally 2.0 and Codemasters have done well where they should have. Cars feel great, physics feels improved, audio is better, FFB is better. All in all this is an improvement over DiRT Rally 2.0. I bloody love the game, variety of the stages and the customisability.

The game lags like shit. Plain and simple.
I've got a 3070 and an R7 5800x with 32 gigs of RAM. I genuinely believe specs are not the problem. It lags whether you have it on ultra low or ultra or anything in between. Unreal engine sucks dick when it comes to performance and has always stuttered. The stutter will never truly go away purely because its based on Unreal Engine, no matter how much they patch, fix do whatever. Sure they can minimize it after a few months but it will NEVER run as smooth as DiRT Rally 2.0.

That being said if you really like rallying and loved the hell out of DiRT Rally 2.0 like I did then you'll have a lovely time despite the blemishes in the game.

Graphics are great not the best, but i believe they will get more better with further updates.
Handling is great, feels like i'm actually controlling the car and it reacts like I think it would. The things you see in real rally how they tap the breaks before a curve feels and looks the same as pro drivers.
Stages are perfect, but one minus in my opinion is that the co-driver gives wrong calls rarely and might jinx the whole stage and race, that's why you have to really focus in the game which makes it so great.

Dirt Rally 2.0 is now the holy grail for many Rally Sim(cade) fans and it was absolutely awful to release. Much more awful than WRC  is now. 
I played DR2.0 when it became available in Early Access some years ago. Physics were bad, selection of tracks were bad, performance was bad, price was bad. Almost everything there was, the community hated. 

EA WRC 2023 is better in almost every aspect. There are some problems that need to be fixed but for me this are just some little things some patches will fix. But it is worth mentioning that there are many players that have problems with performance and micro stutters. I cant talk about those because i am not having a single problem regarding performance. 
Running an 10900 and a 3090 and it runs just fluid.  
Also some people are ranting about Fanatec shifters and wheels and handbrakes not getting recognized. On my system with all my equipment coming from Fanatec it worked Day 1. It even shows me the buttons in the menu with the right colour and label, so i can navigate the whole ingame menu with my wheel. I read many complaints that menu navigation is awful with a wheel and i just cant see why. To me it is perfect, actually no other Racing Game shows me the buttons in the menu. Most games saying something about ""Button 8"", well yeah great...how am i supposed to know what ""Button 8"" is without trial and error. In WRC it says ""Top Right"" and the symbol is a black button. So i know without thinking or trying which button is meant. Best menu in any racing game if youre sitting in your Rig and want to control everything with your wheel. 
I have mouse and keyboard installed to my Rig but i prefer to navigate with my wheel, if it is possible, especially in VR.

Which brings us to the points i am missing in this game. VR is an absolute must, i know they said its coming after release and i absolutely hope it will. Game will still be awesome without it but if they do it right with VR, this will become an absolute blast. 
One other thing i am really missing from DR2.0 are the Daily/Weekly and Monthly challenges. Please bring them back, Multiplayer is nice and Clubs are very nice too but driving the challenges everyday was better in my opinion. 
Get rid of Regularity Rally and give us back the challenges. No one is seriously playing RR because its just not fun. 

So overall this is the best Rally game on the market right now. Yeah i know RBR and yeah it is very good, im with you there, but setting it up is not fun. Graphics are totally outdated. WRC is not that hardcore in terms of damage and i wish it would be more realistic in that matter. But lets be honest, you crash in RBR and the race is over. 
You crash in EA WRC and you can go on, but your race is also over if were talking about winning or driving a fast time that is comparable to other good drivers. Also you will feel the damage on your car. Pretty heavy depending on the crash. Lost a wheel? Damaged your engine? Cracked your Gearbox? Have fun driving to the finish line. It gets really difficult to stay on track or reach speeds youll need to reach to get somewhere good on the leadberboard. 
If you are in an online championship, its basically over. But yeah in the end i shouldnt be able to hit a tree head on with 150km/h and still be able to drive after that. But that is just how it is and i am okay with that. 

Content is huge btw. You pay 50€ and get the whole game with 17 locations if i am not mistaken and 75 cars and lots of game modes. There is some content behind an EA membership but its laughable, youre not missing out on anything. Its just skins and some challenges in Moments mode.
If you wanted to get near that content in DR2.0 when it released youll needed to pay 100€. 

Absolutely recommend this game to rally fans! If you got a Simrig this is the best you can get in my opinion. Cant talk about Gamepad, as i am only playing with wheel but with the right equipment it is an absolute blast.

Ryzen 7 7800x3d (I actually updated my processor just for this game) + 4060Ti + 32gb ddr5 + normal SSD (theres ""SSD Recommended"" in the requirements for a reason), and I get 130-160fps @fullhd with every setting on Ultra, EXCEPT shadows (they're on high because ultra cuts my fps for 50%). The game looks amazing and I think it's a lot better looking than Dirt Rally 2.0.

First of all, the ""bad"" things in this game:
-If you have Fanatec CSR Forza edition (a museum-tier steering wheel) you have to rebind everything since the wheel's not supported, but rather goes into the ""generic wheel"" category
-You have to change between h-pattern and sequential shifting, which I think isn't that bad since you have to change clutch override as well (if you even want to roleplay driving with different era styles)
-Shadow caching could be done at game start, but it's not really a matter to me since I only get a couple stutters a stage and they're so small that I barely notice

And the good things:
+++++The roads are not 4-lane highways like the ones in Dirt Rally -series AND THERE ARE ACTUAL DITCHES (big for Finnish people)
+++Career mode, you can make your own cars and drive multiple car class championships in one season
++Stages are mostly made from real life ones, so they are interesting to drive since you need to change your driving style mid-stage
+FFB feels really good
+Pretty much everything other than the negative ones I listed before

And to people who say that the game is too grippy since it's not driving-on-ice-simulator like RBR: go find a gravel road, steer when driving 60km/h and tell me if you get understeer or oversteer.

Edit: The performance has gotten even better in every update for this game.

Good:
On a wheel it feels pretty good, decent FFB, the career mode is fun having a variety of events and stuff to do. and it being laid out similar to F1 games is good imo. Plus being able to build and race your own car is fun. The racing can be as challenging as you need/want it. The graphics are pretty good, no real complaints there, the tracks all look good, the cars look great, the audio is really good too.
Meh:
The rally school is interesting and gives a lot of the basics and some driving tricks, but it would be nice if it was more expansive, maybe going more into what the callouts mean, and how to interpret them at least for the newer people to this genre. The physics sometimes do goofy things, sometimes a minor incident will turn into something way worse because the car gets tossed like nothing, or the car stalls for seemingly no reason.
Not Good:
This game would be much better with triples support, not just using Nvidia surround. Nvidia surround isn't terrible but not being able to adjust the angle between monitors makes the outer screens image off angle and squished. The FOV adjustment is trash, not even just for triples but in general, it should be listed in degrees like EVERY OTHER GAME, having it be a slider from 0-100 is pointless for people who actually calculate FOV for sim racing, it makes zero sense.

Definitely worth checking out, if not buying at least on the EA play subscription. Hopefully future patches add triple support, and fix the FOV settings.",1700527857,1700527857,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Several years back, I picked up Dirt Rally 2.0 on a whim.  I had no idea what rally racing even was.  I'm still a beginner.  I know next to nothing about cars in general.  I really enjoyed Dirt 2.0 and it so happened the urge to play a racing game was rising in me around WRC's release so I picked it up.

I've been very happy with this game.  Overall I think it is an improvement over Dirt Rally 2.0, especially for new drivers like me.

The visuals and sound design in the game are absolutely incredible.  The details on the cars and the stages are great.  It looks gorgeous.

The racing itself is amazing.  Everything feels great.  I feel like they did a great job with all the varying racing surfaces, from gravel, tarmac, mud, and ice.  I love the different cars, and I love the new hybrid boosters that are in this game which weren't in Dirt Rally 2.0. 

I have read other players complain about stuttering or performance issues in the game.  I'm running the game on a RTX 2080 at 1440p, and it runs amazing.  Occasionally I see a few graphical glitches.  For example I have noticed some tire tread marks on the pavement in front of me occasionally get ""drawn in"" and I've seen some oddities with ice textures.  This doesn't happen often though and doesn't affect my driving.

I LOVE all the game modes!  I haven't had the time to try out all of them, there are so many!  Career mode is great, Championship is fun, and I love the Moments racing.  I have yet to get into the Clubs but I plan on it sometime soon.  Especially for new players, I find Career mode really nice.  Dirt Rally 2.0 did not guide me enough as a new racer, and this game does.  So far the only thing I am missing from Dirt Rally 2.0 are the Daily and Weekly challenges.  I really hope that EA adds those back in.

The interface is so much improved over Dirt Rally 2.0.  There is much more information that you're given, and everything is so much clearer.  There's a few minor things here and there... like icons that appear on certain races or cars that I had to look up what they meant, but these are small things.  

I am not an expert on racing, so it's hard for me to say, but I feel like the physics in WRC are slightly more forgiving than the physics in Dirt Rally 2.0.  That's not to say the game is easier, it is still a difficult racing game for me, and I feel like I'm still getting the feel for the game and certain classes of cars.

I play the game with a controller.  It is really nice and responsive, but when I first picked up the game I found the default sensitivity was too high, and had to turn it down.  I also saw other players report they had to do this as well.  I have considered purchasing a wheel JUST for this game, but I don't know if I race enough to justify the cost.

In terms of negatives, there are not many, and most of them don't concern this game considered by itself, but rather things I liked about Dirt Rally 2.0 that aren't here.

Your racing co-driver, Phil, was so much more immersive in Dirt Rally 2.0, and I miss him.  The co-drivers in WRC are more robotic.  They're still well done, but it's just not the same.

There are a few specific cars that were in Dirt Rally 2.0 that I really loved driving that i was surprised are missing from this game.  I'm hoping they'll get added... but I'm wary of DLC costs.

I miss the Daily and Weekly challenges.

There are some events and unlocked cosmetics that are only available if you sign up for EA's membership service, EA Play, which costs $5 per month.

It seems like the driving physics are a little better than previous versions as one would expect from a new version.  Dirt Rally 2.0 is still very good though and because the tracks are not the same between the two games, I may be playing both if I feel like driving some of the tracks.

A couple of things I wish I knew, but would not deter me from buying or playing this game.
The menus are harder to navigate and require more clicks to get through them.  This is a bit annoying for me, but not a deal breaker.
There is no way to directly participate in a championship with older cars unless you build a custom one or get lucky to find the one you want in career mode(they are like side championships within career mode).  I like driving a lot of different cars, so this was kind of a disappointment for me.  The game is very much focused on the 2023 Rally season in real life, so the 3 classes they run are the ones that are the focus of the game.  
The rally school is a great idea, but in practice didn't really work for me.  This part of the game introduces the basic concepts of driving, but doesn't teach it in any kind of depth and you need that depth to really get good at driving and at this game.  I found I already knew everything it taught, I just always could use more practice and coaching to get better.
The marketing around this game made it sound like you could pick from several different weather patterns and seasons of the year to race in.  I so far have not found this to be the case, all the tracks I've tried so far have the same wet or dry conditions that were in previous versions.  Seems incomplete.

Now for a couple of things I found were nice features.
The build your own car features are cool, I enjoyed playing around with it in the freestyle mode where you can just put whatever parts you want on the car.  As a gearhead, I would like to see more information on power curves from engines, shift times from fancier parts, and other more technical information on the parts, but it's still fun to do.  
The difficulty settings are finally user adjustable to what you want in career mode or championship mode.  This is really nice because when I switch cars, I typically need some time to get good at that car or car type and need an easier difficulty setting.  I couldn't do that in previous versions, so I'd end up being way behind for a while and getting demoted before being able to climb back up on top and it was kind of annoying.  This fixes this issue for me, so I'm happy with that.
The new tracks are fun and I'm glad there are a lot of them.  In previous versions in longer career or championships, you'd visit every location available every time because there just wasn't enough tracks to make for different championships at that length.

No VR - to be added in future update
No true triple monitor support - to be improved after launch

*EDIT UDP support has been provided, making a great game only better.

Some people are clearly having performance issues but I'm not. I did get some stutter when I first played it (we believe it's shader caching) but after a short time it all evaporated.

90fps AVG @ 3440x1440p everything set to max (apart from anisotropoic filtering, car reflections, upscaling are all off).

As the key features are coming, I recommend the game fully. 

Arguably though, telemetry should have been available at launch. Waiting on VR is normal with Codemasters in the Dirt Rally series & I think they honestly hadn't even thought about triple monitor support until they were confronted by the fan base.

- better co-driver
- WRC cars
- more annoying ""modern"" game menu

Dirt Rally and DR 2.0 to me were (to me) the pinnacle of what Codemasters had achieved at the time. I absolutely dreaded when EA acquired Codemasters. I have been concerned about micro transactions and other bullsh*t that would tarnish a beautifully crafted rally experience. I was worried that the house that Codemasters built would lose its soul (Yes, I understand that Codemasters had cars and tracks as DLC). Alas in some ways I was correct. They added that insipid swag element into the game. Here's some gloves, here's a helmet, how about a driving suit bullsh*t. The core game however still hits those classic beats. It has real WRC stages. It has that twitch reaction driving. It has that grueling, sweat coming out of you, try to master a car and stage feel. However, the game isn't without its problems.

I am running the game on a modest setup with an OC I9-9900k, 64gb ram and an RTX 4070. I am very impressed with the DLSS support. For a system that is well over 5 years old and out of date, it runs smooth as butter (all software related issues aside). The DLSS doesn't have that obvious ghosting and smearing problem that many DLSS titles have as they continue to build on the tech. I'm running with all the settings maxed at Ultra. To me, that is very impressive as it feels like I still have a little more time before having to fully upgrade my PC. 

The caveat to the above is... Well... The game is clearly poorly optimized. I have experience the stutter as everyone else has. You can be cooking down a long stretch ready to hit a hairpin left, and out of nowhere you experience a moment of stutter. It completely messes up your entry to the corner. As frustrating as this is, I say it is a product of the Production System. What does that mean you ask? Well, the developers know that isn't how things should be. They want all the time under the sun to code a game that functions as close to 100% as they can possibly create. The production company (EA) however has licensing contracts and goals in mind. In this case, the 2023 WRC season is winding down. Most other US motorsports have finished their respective seasons. EA wants to get the product out to the Motorsports fans to catch the tail end of the WRC season without any competition, knowing full well that the game needs more time. EA knows that we are not longer bound by CDs and legacy media. We have broadband internet and everything else can be fixed in post. The game will be patched over the next several weeks and it will improve. Was it released in a broken state? No. Was it released in an unready state? Absolutely. I ask you all, not to hate the game but rather the broken system that favors this style of production. We were released a late beta product. There is a lot of quality in this game and fun to be had if you can stick with it. In the 3 weeks since release, it is evident that the developers are working on it. I have faith that this game will only get better as we go. Everyone has a right to be p*ssed off about what was launched. It should be alarming that a game that already weighs in at over 80gb installed, needed and 83gb patch on November 16. That leads me to believe that I basically had to re-download a more polished build of the game! This is unfortunately the trajectory that all games are going nowadays.

Graphically, I don't think there is anything here that is ground breaking. I have watched many reviews saying that the graphics are last gen. Codemasters switched from a proprietary engine of which they had full creative knowledge to Unreal Engine. Does it look bad? No. Is it hitting the full potential of the Unreal Engine? No! Is it fun and immersive? Absolute yes! With that said, I remember the slog of crappy NASCAR titles when they attempted to revive the Heat series. WRC is nowhere at that level. I have also put in a lot of time with Hungarian Rallysim Fans Richard Burns Rally, which is a base game that has been stretched many times beyond its life cycle with limited, albeit impressive results.

My recommendation is that if you're on the fence, give it a bit more time. See where everything shakes out with patches. Maybe wait for a Steam sale if you're really questioning the game. Its your money. I took the plunge and picked it up early, and I am more happy than frustrated. Everyone's mileage may vary.

[h2]11/19/23: My first impressions[/h2]

For context before I actually talk about the game, I'm a pretty big fan of rally sims. I haven't made it so far as to try the ""holy grail"" that is RBR that a bunch of rally sim people online say is good, but I've put hundreds of hours in the dirt franchise, with most of them in Dirt Rally and Dirt Rally 2.0. Other than some time spent in Dirt Rally 1 on gamepad, I also typically only play these games with a racing wheel (Logitech G29).

Broadly, I don't know if this game is good enough that I'm willing to declare it ""Dirt Rally 3.0"", but it's also good enough that I'm still enjoying it, and at least at this time, I'm confident saying that I think you're going to like it if you enjoyed previous Codemasters' games like Dirt Rally, Dirt Rally 2.0, and Dirt 4. Pick it up on sale after all the technical issues are ironed out if you're on the fence on if you'll like it or not. 

Talking about the feeling of driving in the game itself, it feels like there's genuine improvements over DR2.0 when it comes to handling on tarmac, and, at least off the top of my head, the gravel and snow physics feel about on par with what I remember them being in DR2.0. I've heard that there's some improvements in how rwd cars are easier to handle in this compared to what they were in DR2.0, but I've only naturally encountered 4wd and fwd cars in my playthrough so far, so I'll have to cover this in a later review once I run into those cars. 

Speaking of the gameplay that strings along the bits where you're actively in a car rallying, I feel this is also an improvement over previous Dirt Rally games. I like how it gamifies running a rally team, and find that it actually adds some interesting background tasks to rallies you're doing that you otherwise wouldn't get out of DR2.0 (e.g., having to worry about not breaking your repair budget in a provided car in a benefactor event). 

Speaking of the technical issues of the game, I'm running the game on my simracing rig with a Ryzen 5 5600/RX 5700 XT/16GB ram, on a 1080p 144hz monitor, and I'm seeing performance that's fine. I had a bunch of stuttering issues for the first hour or so I had in the game before the 1.3 update went live, but the rest of my time after downloading that update has been ok. [i]Usually[/i] the game seems to run at 144hz, with the occasional framerate drops depending on how much is going on in the background on the rally stage I'm on. Graphically I'm indifferent about it compared to its predecessors, it's good enough that it does what it needs to, and I can live with that. 

Finally, I want to talk about just the backlash of the state of the game this close after release. When it comes to previous Codemasters games, they haven't had particularly good launches either. I remember preordering Dirt Rally 2.0 and having RaceNet issues that locked you out of the single player career mode, remember having bizarre technical issues upon the launch of Dirt 5, etc. All of which have taught me that it's [i]usually[/i] a safe bet to let a new Codemasters rally game sit for a bit, and have them iron out the technical issues before it becomes functional. Now reading some of the other reviews, it sounds like this is extremely arbitrary based on PC specs, but at least on my machine, I feel like it's just barely in the zone where it's now functional. There's probably still work to be done, but at least for now I haven't seen anything so bad that it's stuck with me when writing this review.",1700427444,1700427444,True,4,1,0.561471700668334961,0,True,False,False

fps can range from 30fps to 260fps depending on stage (ultra settings for me)
night is too bright
co-driver is sometimes too slow
rally pass is just stupid but atleast the lock on the content is tiny so far(i dont belive it to stay so since this is EA)
graphics worse than dr2

good:
tarmac physics actually feel solid compared to dr2
physics in general are good
each car has a distinct feel
a lot of content
interesting and new career mode
multiplayer is not dead

Fairly easy to pick up, but hard to master.
Especially when every assist is off and you drive the appropriate gearbox type.

Physics and handling have been improved from Dirt Rally 1.0 & 2.0 but still has some minor issues.
Not as much ""Arcade"" as were the original WRC's but still fun (with some assists when driving on a game pad)

Graphics are good, but demanding of hardware, which I currently don't have, but lower resolution and settings do the job.

Works great with Fanatec Wheels + Pedals & SSH Shifter.

I have only had a few frame drops / stutters since the patch, and honestly the vehicle handling is by far the best I've experienced in any of the rally games I've tried so far (WRC 10, Generations, DR 2.0)

For some reason the force feedback locked up on my first launch of the game, but after a restart it's also great (playing on a G29)

The career mode is also a lot of fun. I really like how I can get the budget (or stay over it) to play around with my good old Impreza '98 in actual rallies

Soundtrack is quite varied in style for being mainstream, but everything is good and fits.

Also a big plus coming from DR 2.0 is that AI times aren't unbeatable at 50%. Quite the opposite actually, I'd say everyone can find themselves a challenge at a certain percentage, but AI skill varies from stage to stage, so I'm not so sure.
Speaking of DR 2.0 I've had orders of magnitudes less punctures here than in that game. They are still definitely possible, but you can have fun driving and not resetting after every scratch.

Stages are a nice mix of the DR series and the WRC series. I loved the old WRC Monte Carlo (not accounting for some of the clipping used on cliff sides, that I'd often hit without touching), and straight up hated the DR one. I'm fine with this one, I'd just love if there was an option to play it with more snow. I guess global warming is everywhere huh...

If you're still on the fence about the game try the EA pass, you can get the first month for 0.80 € and have 5 hours of playtime, which is plenty to decide. On top of that you get 10% off if you buy it while you still have the pass.

Overall for a game that's not even priced at the old standard of 60€ (let alone the ridiculous 70€ price tag they're pushing nowadays) the game is definitely worth it for rally lovers.",1700292884,1700292884,True,0,2,0,0,True,False,False

I wasn't very excited for this game initially but I was still curious, being the first WRC title released since EA's acquisition of Codemasters. When I saw that there was an EA Play trial available for this game, I decided to try it. I remember completing the download at 1AM and thinking ""oh I'll just play it for 30 minutes to get some brief impressions"".

I ended up playing until 3AM.

I honestly can't remember the last time I just loaded into a stage and drove in a racing game. I was just captivated in the moment, negotiating the fast, sweeping turns that Sweden had to offer in a Rally4 Fiesta. I didn't complain about the physics, I didn't complain about the co-driver's voice (not at that moment anyway, I just like DR 2.0's more, sorry), and I just didn't have anything on my mind. I simply drove.

I guess there is something to be said about games that make me feel this way, and perhaps I'm a strange one for even feeling this way at all, but the first ~6 hours I spent in the game were nothing but pure driving bliss for me. When it comes to other racing games, I tend to concentrate on how cars drive, how the game handles car/track interactions (curbs, for instance), and the like - I never thought of such factors during the initial 6 hours, and I don't think much about them even now. Perhaps it's simply that I believe the overall execution of the handling model and car physics fall in line with my expectations, and to be fair, I don't believe this to be a bad thing in the slightest. I expected this to be another installation in the DR franchise, and I got just that in this product.

I won't give a pass to the devs for all the performance issues at launch, though. No shader pre-compilation almost guaranteed frequent and sometimes major stutters (I was lucky not to encounter this issue very much), which is a death sentence in a game where reactions are key. However, it seems that patch 1.2.0 has already addressed this, so this should be more or less a non-issue by now.

Simply put, this release has genuinely surprised me, I did not expect to fall in love with it this much. I ended up liking it so much that I outright bought the game the following day. As of the time of writing this, I'm still repeating the same cycle of load, drive, repeat.

Tarmac feels way more enjoyable in this game than in DR2, and career mode is a big improvement in general over what DR2 offered. I was extremely excited to play career and drive the WRC rally1 cars, but I have a few gripes that make that part of the game very underwhelming.

1) THIS IS BY FAR THE BIGGEST PROBLEM. You have no indication or control over the hybrid activation in the 1st person mode with OSD deactivated beyond a vague sense of how much throttle input you're using. This compounds with another problem here when throttle input below say 70% feels like it does nothing on the cars. As a result, you cant feather the throttle on a hairpin without activating insane boost and just spinning out. PLEASE give me a button I can press to activate and deactivate the hybrid unit at will, this will lead to a higher skill ceiling and a much more enjoyable class.

2) The feeling of progression essentially disappears when you get to the main WRC part of the career. I have difficulty set to 100 and I either totally crush or have no chance against the top opponents. I would love to see these times be more consistent.

3) I know this will be added in DLC, but please more maps, longer maps, and more cars. I'm only 50 or so hours in at this point and most of the maps are familiar. Also, many of the classes have 1-2 cars and make me wonder why the class even exists as a stand-alone thing.",1700238056,1700238819,True,1,1,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

[h2]✅Highly recommended for fans of WRC, Dirt Rally games, immersive simulations, challenging multiplayer experiences, or just epic rally experiences.[/h2]


📋[b]EA WRC is the official video game of the FIA World Rally Championship, delivering all the current WRC, WRC2, and Junior WRC cars, along with 68 legendary cars spanning over 60 years of rallying history.[/b]The advanced Dynamic Handling System ensures a realistic feel on various surfaces, whether dirt, gravel, sand, mud, asphalt, ice or snow. The stages themselves are massive this time along with improved, cutting-edge visuals. With 17 different locations, 5 different game modes, the return of Clubs and the all new Rally School, there's a lot of content packed into this game for under $50 USD. 

🚦Note: While this is an EA game, you'd be hard pressed to believe it with this game. There's a massive amount of content packed into WRC and it cost far less than their other games. Worth mentioning too it [u]currently doesn't have any micro-transactions of any sort![/u] And you can enjoy the bulk of the game without having to be logged into the internet.



[h2]🚙Start your engines, it's time for a shakedown!🚩[/h2]


🔶In WRC, you're not just driving; you're experiencing the heart-pounding world of competitive rally racing, where precision, speed, and control are paramount. The game's meticulous attention to detail and realistic mechanics set the stage for an epic rally adventure as you compete in various locations around the world. Each event presents a unique challenge, from treacherous weather conditions to varied terrains and unpredictable surfaces that change numerous times throughout a single stage, making each rally a distinct and thrilling experience you won't soon forget.

🚧 Note: At launch, many of us, myself included had performance issues but those have since been remedied after the first patch.



[h2]🎮 Gameplay 🕹️[/h2]


🔶WRC supports just about every device known to man in terms of your prefered gamepad controllers, racing wheels, shifters, handbrakes and more.

🔶You [b]no longer need to have a constant internet connection to enjoy the best features the game has to offer this time around.[/b]

🔶There's multiple game modes to play, from Career Mode, Custom Championships, Moments where you relive iconic events in rally history or highlights from the latest season, the return of Clubs, Quick Play and the new Rally School for newcomers and veterans alike to learn and develop new skills and techniques.  

🚦Note: If you really want to feel the car come alive, driving without [i]any[/i] assist is the way to go! 

🔶In career mode, you start with a basic sponsorship and rally car, but as your journey unfolds, you'll be able to recruit engineers, unlock powerful upgrades for your chief engineer, obtain team mates and aquire aditional funds to buy more powerful machines to compete in higher categories and events. Your choices in tuning and upgrades dramatically impact your strategy and how your rally career will develop, especially if you opt into using your own custom built rally cars where you'll be able to research and unlock powerful new components to use. 

🛣️""If in doubt, flat out."" - [i]Colin McRae[/i]🚗

🔶 In WRC, the thrill of competitive rallying comes to life with a variety of authentic rally cars, each with its own unique handling characteristics and performance attributes. From iconic models like the Lancia Delta S4 to the latest WRC Hybrids, the game offers a diverse selection of cars to choose from!

🔶WRC boasts a lot of new customization options like the ability to build your own rally cars from scratch or the new livery editor. Ever wondered what Ferrari would bring to the table if they created a modern day rally car? Now you can with a sprinkle of creativity and imagination! 

🔶What stands out in EA WRC is the attention to detail in the overall rally experience. Each stage feels unique thanks to using real world locations along with the dynamic weather system, stage degradation and seasonal settings. 

🔶Other factors that stand out are the much improved force feedback, super accurate co-driver callouts, revamped physics for gravel & tarmac, improved handling that gives you a better feeling of weight transfer, the revitalized hardcore damage that gives hiring engineers purpose or my personal favorite; the new tire model that is much more dynamic in terms of tire wear rates and the effects of them falling off.

🔶The sound effects for this game are outstanding, with engines roaring, tires screeching, gravel pinging against the floorboard that combined creates an immersive atmosphere and true to life rally soundscape.

💖 [b]WRC is a love letter to rally fans the world over that oozes with passion and love from the developers.[/b] It doesn't just capture the essence of piloting powerful rally cars; it embodies the rally tradition and challenges of mastering different cars, terrains and in different weather conditions. At its essence, it's [u]pure rally bliss.[/u] 

📋EA SPORTS WRC manages to deliver an adrenaline-filled racing experience, complete with a satisfying simcade driving model, a plethora of great stages, and engaging choices to make in terms of progression over your career. The game is not without its flaws however, and the occasional performance hiccups on some PC's is frustrating but the rewards far outweigh any shortcomings this game has.

This might be a great game for you. If the game modes don't put you off and you have no issues with the graphical stuttering, you may well enjoy it. But I strongly recommend driving Dirt Rally 2.0 first, because it's a much better game, in my opinion.

Pros:
[list]
[*] Tarmac handling is better than DR2.
[*]  The car list is good - not incredible, but very strong overall with a good set of cars through history and really nice modelling and detailing, especially compared to the recent Nacon games. Highlights are the Sunbeam and Avenger in H2, the expanded F2 class and the new S2000 and S1600 classes.
[*]  The big one - stages - these are well modelled and epic and there's 600km+ of them over 18 different locales. Great variety and detail and a lot more weather and time options compared to Dirt Rally 2. Very nice and the biggest 'pro' of all, especially with the seasonal variety as a bonus on top.
[*] Sounds are still very good, similar to DR2. They have a bit less 'artistic licence' so feel a bit more muted in some places, but this is more accurate for a driver IMO
[*] Choice of English co-drivers is nice and both options are very well done, especially considering the notes are 'generic' and not done in the Dirt Rally 'motion rig' method, I think both are excellent
[*] Visual effects, such as dust trails, are exceptional - there are also nice graphical details like spectators dressing for the weather.
[/list]

For TLDR, here's my Cons list, but I'll go into more detail below

Cons:
[list]
[*] Performance. I'll go into this below, but even if you are lucky not to experience stuttering, the game doesn't seem to run buttery smooth even on the fastest GPUs. And even then, there's background 'forest fire' smoke/fog on a lot of locations and weathers, to (try to) hide the ferocious pop-in of fauna.
[*] The game modes are awful. Dailies have been removed, replaced with a Moments feature that has none of the jeopardy. The single player Championships only revolve around the official WRC classes. There's no way to run a 'realistic' historic championship with RWD cars because you always run down the road order behind more modern cars. The career mode is a cumbersome joke and removes a lot of the randomisation and variety that the previous games had.
[*] I want to re-emphasise how bad the Career mode is. You're railroaded into certain competitions and drives that you may not want and have no logic. They've removed seasonal calendar variety so there's no difference from one season to the next. Opponents don't change teams and there's no 'game world' at all, unlike Codemasters' F1 games. You can't be hired by works teams. Just to emphasise, it is literally against the WRC1 rules to enter as a privateer, but here it's the ONLY option. It tries to make you care about the staff, despite having no reason as there isn't any personality. There's an awful voice intro to each rally from an 'engineer' until you switch it off. Why was time sunk into making this so much worse?
[*] The Builder mode... did anyone request this? It feels like such a time sink for something that makes no sense - a rear engined WRC car is against the rules of the sport. The wing is something that's defined by the class, but here I can run a Rally1 wing on a Rally2 car for some reason. It's completely gamified nonsense to me.
[*] The livery editor is very limited, no official logos even of mandated WRC partners from real life (eg Pirelli logos for tyres). No share mode, so the nice liveries that people have poured hours into are just for them. It's another waste of time.
[*] The car list is good but has significant failings. Still can't work out a deal with Toyota or Hyundai for any of their historical cars? No Nissans. Why is there a category (H3 RWD) mixing cards from the 70s and 90s in it, when Group B RWD is the 80s? Why is a 1997 Subaru Impreza and a 2010 Citroen C4 WRC in the same class? Why has a 90s Nova been added to the 60s cars in H1? Why have RGT cars (one of my favourites from DR2) been dropped completely? I get there are licence and budgetry concerns, but the decisions on classes are entirely with the devs.
[*] In my opinion, it looks decent and I'm OK with its general looks, but it doesn't look as pretty as Dirt Rally 2.0 does. I get there are compromises to allow longer stages and faster workflow, but from a straight comparison to me, it doesn't look better.
[*] UI is so much worse than DR2. There's avatars, pictures, faces and clutter everywhere instead of information. Changing tyres or setup now takes extra clicks. The homepage... why is it a massive car and a thin strip of clickable options? Animations between screens take extra seconds each click.
[*] There's more, but are you still reading? Game modes and performance are the headlines.
[/list]

Right, that out of the way, let's move on.

I don't like this game. The only reason I didn't refund is that EA mothballed my account and I couldn't log into the game on release day. So I lost one hour there. Then, after making a new email address to make a new account, I tried playing and it was a technical nightmare; stuttering galore. This is on a 7800XT with 16gb memory. I spent another couple of hours changing settings, getting a controller set up and tweaking graphics over and over to address the stutters. Then, 3 and a bit hours in, Steam refused to refund me.

The developer acknowledges these issues, there are many reports from third-party publications about them..... but no, EA say ""should have used EA Play"", Steam say ""we like your money, it's your problem sucker"". EA/Codemasters are patching it and stuttering is reduced, but it more and more feels like UE4 has fundamental problems making it unsuitable for this type of game.

And then there's the game itself. In my personal opinion, it's much worse than Dirt Rally 1 and 2. My two favourite things in those games were the simple career mode, where a calendar was randomly generated and you had to compete for a promotion/relegation system, and the Daily online events. Both of these have been removed from the game and replaced with alternatives that are far more 'gamer' friendly, but much less appealing to me.

This should be the perfect game for me. I loved Dirt Rally 1 and 2 and I'm a huge rally nut who's travel around the continent to spectate modern and historic rally cars. But somehow, 5 years have gone into this and I'm an open goal missed. Or am I? EA and Steam have my money, and they won't give it back despite selling me a broken and poorly designed product. They might be delighted with that outcome.

The only thing I want to be able to do, is pick a rally car to pretend to be a rally driver of various eras. I can't do that in EA WRC.

[list]
[*]Lack of optimization: 60-80 fps depending on stage using RTX 3080 in 1440p on Mid to High settings. I understand that this is the first time devs using Unreal 5, but graphics-wise this game hasn't got much better than Dirt Rally 2.0, and has got even worse in some cases;
[*]Stutters were fixed in single player, but oh boy, in multiplayer you get these long ass stutters that can last up to 2 seconds. I think it could be some kind of synchronization issue between players. Anyway, needless to say, there shouldn't have been any stutters in the first place;
[*]Speaking of multiplayer: it would be great if players could run in order like in DiRT 3 multiplayer;
[*]Most of the objects on stages are not breakable: small trees close to a road, street signs, wooden fences, etc. Even DiRT 2 allowed you to break electricity poles and even stone walls. Here, if you smash into a stop sign full speed, your car will be ruined.
[*]I can be wrong, but RWD cars handling is very strange. You get these ""rear of the car wants to overtake front"" moments while breaking, especially on tarmac stages, and the shorter a car's wheel base is, the more unpredictable under breaking a car is. Renault 5 Turbo is a good example. I understand that rally RWD cars should drive with oversteer, but in this game, it's very hard to predict when car is gonna violently ""snap"" into it.

-= For context, diving on full rig with e brake and shifter, ultra-wide monitor. =-

Career mode, fine bones, no frills, but not put together in a way that makes for an entirely enjoyable experience. (had to do 2 JR WRC seasons because I didn't realize I would lose points for not fulfilling a goal, I thought I just wouldn't gain them.)

Physics/tracks - There's some real good stuff, and some not so good stuff. Some vehicles and tracks way more enjoyable than others. 

Clubs - Again, fine bones, no frills, but you can leave the event and come back fully repaired which means you can cheese the whole thing. Pretty huge hiccup to the entire structure of it.

Customization - Would be good if you could see numerical relationships to transformations on the livery editor, but you can't, and you can't mirror a design to the other side either. Which, is a bit high on my list of current ""how did this get an ok"" list. 

There's more, but I'm trying to be more concise with updating it. I've continued playing this after my initial review, I'm kinda hooked, and really digging some rally right now. But it's all kind of tempered with frustrations with some pretty glaring problems in certain areas. 

Devs seems responsive, so far, which is good, and hopefully they can keep beefing it up. The cynical part of my brain however is expecting that we'll not see a lot of these physics and when/if WRC 24 gets announced we're going to see these fixes marketed as new features. We'll see though. 

So, though I'm enjoying it, I wouldn't exactly recommend it. RBR has better handling, and is free, so it's got  it's ups and downs, but better online component. WRC Generations has a better career mode, and feels a little more bolted together in general. But, I'm here playing this right now because I've already played the other two and this just kinda has my attention ATM.

Instead of bouncing between a too-easy and too-hard (clubmaster) tiers in Dirt 2, you can adjust difficulty at any time from 1-100, which is great. The huge long tracks are awesome, there's way more variety in tracks.

In Mexico you drive through rural towns with pick-up trucks parked on roadsides, through cement plants, past waterfalls, along cliff edges and through varied desert biomes.

In Monaco you start in a little Monacan rustic village with its narrow streets and right-angle turns, onto a highway, then into the forest up the mountain, along cliffs, through a tunnel, into mixed dirt/mud, snow, then patchy ice, and finally all-ice near the summit where you have sweeping vistas of 10-15 mile views of the opposing mountains with forests, and a valley with a river at the bottom.

The scale of this game is conveyed with the huge worlds made possible with long draw-distances and full-range texture of track biomes.

I usually learned my lesson, but hopes were high since dirt rally 2 wasn't that bad, even if I still prefer RallySimFans Richard Burns Rally, which is free with about 500 tracks and superior physics. Which is where I will go back to now again, because it actually HAS a vr mod that really works like a charme. WRC will never get the vr working, if they release the game in that state with stutters and everything which till this day is a big problem for dirt rally 2 vr as well. VR never got really fixed and so will it be with wrc and I am so sick of it!

Nearly forgot about the absolutly rediculous damage model of this game:D In most rally games you touch a fence and your game is over. Here you can slam full speed into a fence and just keep going :D The car is not spinning because of the impact at all. it is beyond rediculous. I play on hardest setting with all assists off and it feels like need for speed..

Will get a refund right now and maybe buy the game on sale again, in a year or so, if they got it fixed and maybe implemented better physics, which I really doubt they will be able to do. FFS!

Racing experience - few hundred hours in Gran Turismo franchise growing up, somewhere under 100 hours in DR 2.0 (VR headset, controller-only, placing anywhere from top 50%-25% in the daily/weekly DR 2.0 challenges).
-----------------------------
Some of the negative reviews say ""stutter on my decent rig"" but don't state their rig specs and target resolution/framerate.

Ryzen 5800x/Radeon 6800XT
1440p on a 75hz monitor.
Most settings on ultra, with shadows/reflections on medium.
FSR on quality settings.
No major stuttering issues (at least none that have completely taken me out of the experience - in a 20km+ mexico rally, got a few dropped frames in one or two corners)
Racing using the Bonnet view, most driving time in group A.
-------------------------------

Racing:
great. feels nice. driving on asphalt doesn't suck.
Not sure if i'm dumb and can't figure it out or what, but playing jWRC career, the tire types are preselected for events, you just get to choose the order in which you select them. you get an extra set for the shakedown still.
Tuning is just a bunch of sliders/arrows with numbers. personally i prefer when gear ratio tuning has a graph, but it is what it is. Not that i'm much of a tuner - i tend to keep default tuning on most cars, and only adjust gear ratios depending on the stage corners/hill climbs.

Rally School:
awesome! it's fun and can definitely help newbies get into the swing of things. just wish they had different courses for Front-wheel/RWD and 4WD vehicles, as learning the differences between the different types can be difficult for beginners. doing nothing but spinning out with RWD is no fun, especially if you're just trying to complete a RWD event for some career bonuses. That being said, i feel like i'm less prone to completely losing control with RWD in WRC than in DR2.0

Music/Sound:
Music is great, awesome. Sound design is very fun. if you blow the doors off your vehicle and are in cockpit view, you WILL hear the outside more on the side you lost your door. Co-drivers don't have the same annoying commentary at the end of a stage that they did in DR2.0 hopefully we'll get more co-driver voices later as they are a little limited. also wish they had an option to ""sample"" the co-driver voice when selecting the voice - as it stands, you have to adjust the voice then run a trial to see what the voice sounds like.

Livery:
You get some options to edit the livery! better than only presets available. the bad - wish there was a way to ""create a livery"" when selecting a car. annoying to jump into a race for career locked to only one car and you haven't set a livery up for it, and the only option is the single default livery.

Stages:
Fun fun fun. lots of choices, and even though they have some of the same roads when in the same country, they change some critical corners to mix it up. nice mix of asphalt and gravel stages.

Waiting for:
daily challenges - but this may be solved by clubs? i don't know and forced social aspects seem annoying to me. It was nice in DR 20.0 to see a daily or weekly to jump into it. especially if i didn't know what to do and just wanted to drive without having to see the same person on the #1 leaderboard for that stage.
VR mode (probably waiting for optimization to improve - but it's on the roadmap if i recall)

With almost 20 hours since release, I'm pretty happy with what my money has gotten me so far, will spend more time and looking forward to seeing what the future holds.

[b]EDIT 2:[/b] As it turns out, that patch was version 1.2, not 1.3. This is in spite of how the patch notes and posts prior to that originally said 1.3, whilst the game itself said 1.2. This is...remarkably silly and it shows an impressive lack of communication here.

[i]The original review follows on from here.[/i]

So...this is a very reluctant thumbs down, because this is a good game — I enjoy playing it, and it's probably the best-playing rallying game we've had since the venerable Richard Burns Rally — but I have one glaring issue with this game.

During night stages in particular (others have reported the effect also happens in rainy conditions), it's impossible to run a stage as the screen is overwhelmed by black visual artifacts, and none of the settings solve the problem.

Now, I should stress: I am running the game on an NVIDIA GTX 980 Ti, which [i]technically[/i] means I'm below specification, generationally. However, the game is still playable at 1080p on the High preset without upscaling (provided that I turn the 'Car Reflections' setting to Ultra Low, because the artifacts also drench car interiors like Anish Kapoor with Vantablack), so [i]really[/i] the game is still playable for me, but not in a state I can consider properly acceptible.

I have posted on the EA Answers forum about this, and I discovered that a number of respondents to my post are in a similar boat to me, in that they are using NVIDIA GPUs that make use of the Maxwell architecture (so basically anything 900-series).

As a result, I would hope that The Powers That Be — be they Codemasters, EA, or NVIDIA — devise a fix that would enable us to be able to play the game without the horrible glitchy situation going on in night stages. I'd have been playing for quite a lot longer than this, but my time in the game is curtailed until a fix for this issue comes about.",1699034455,1700066392,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game features a serviceable campaign mode, though I've had the most fun with just setting up my own custom championships to race through in the car class of my choice, or taking on global leaderboards in the Time Trial and Clubs modes.

There's a lot of arguing whether or not the physics are realistic, but these people were moaning about this before the game came out (how many of them are actually rally drivers anyway?). I believe Codemasters did a tremendous job in making it as realistic and fun as possible. It's not an arcade game. It's also no RBR. Let's just accept that this is EA Sports WRC and that's that.

I haven't been encountering many or any bugs at all after the first patch. For me the game also doesn't stutter, loads very fast and there's a ton of small details that make the game simply great.

I think it's an improvement on Dirt Rally 2.0 in every sense imaginable, the tracks are better the handling and the physics are spot on, cars are wonderful to drive and we can even make our own custom championships now with any (WRC) class imaginable which is just amazing.

I have heard that there is now even a custom car builder as well which is kind of cool because of different philosophies involved with rallying like, engine in the middle, rear or the front and car's design as well but I have to check this feature out. It is cool and I would love to have a track builder as well which would make this game the ULTIMATE rally experience I think and it's all right that people don't like it because of some aspects to me it's really oh so wonderful because the car for instance on ice tarmac stages does exactly what I want it to do and behaves as I would expect it to so in this regard it's just a big bag of wonderful.

Thank you for the game, the features where amongst again the possibility to have for instance unlimited restarts and the option to make our own custom championships as well as for including basically so many rally cars including GroupB as well, this is all amazing and the price is a banger.

Performance wise yeah it's a (system) hog but it's now again up to the hardware developers to cook up some hardware that can run this game and other modern ones smooth as a whistle. Unreal Engine might be the best game engine out there and it shows in different ways I think for instance in regards to graphical fidelity like details and how beautiful the tracks look by design and graphically. I am kind of glad that more and more developers are using this engine for to develop their games in, it's pretty good.

-physics (improved from DR2.0 - in my opinion)

Cons:
-PERFORMANCE (still suffering from low framerates, stuttering still happens occasionally, some locations get a heavy drop in fps)

It still isn't perfect and has occasional stutters, some stages suffer from very near distance plants, grass and bushes drawing. And sadly the game still feels uglier than DR2.0. But at least it is playable.
I am waiting for further performance improvements. After additional 27 hours of gameplay I still believe that some locations (like Monte Carlo) need optimisation as framerates drop drastically.
I still do not understand how this game can look much uglier than Dirt Rally 2.0 and run much worse.

BEFORE Performance Patch:
Oh Codies... What have you done...
I won't be talking about good things in the game because there's much more bad to discuss. Also the bad things make the good things unplayable. But I will focus on the 2 main bad things.
1. Performance is abysmal. Constant stutter and low frame rates make the game unplayable. I tried playing on all graphic presets from Ultra to Ultra low and that didn't help at all. Aaaaand there are some random crashes.
2. Whoever had the idea to switch from EGO to Unreal Engine should get slapped. In the face. With a chair.
The game looks... ugly. Somehow everything feels... not right. Lighting feels artificial, car models just don't look well, everything feels blurry and unfinished and just looks UGLY. Graphics look much much worse than Dirt Rally 2.0.
Until all problems are resolved I would say: DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY (I'm still considering a refund...).
The biggest issue though will not be fixed... So a humble request to Codies... Next Rally game you make... please build it on EGO. At least it will look and run brilliantly.",1699284940,1700036314,False,68,6,0.671348869800567627,0,True,False,False

The tarmac is fantastic and the rear of the car will actually follow the front now until you really push.
The road feel in the FFB is vastly improved with actual weight to it. Road camber, bumps and weight transfer can all be felt clearly in the steering
We have an actual fleshed out campaign mode now which so far feels pretty well structured and has you making choices about events to compete in, manage teams and upgrade certain aspects of your team in a week by week format

Performance was choppy to start with but this was attributed to a common issue with the unreal engine which has since been improved on and is still being further worked on. Other than that a few setting tweaks may be in order for people, especially the DLSS.
The sound, of course, is still industry best and has somehow been made even better since DR2
Scenery and effects all around are gorgeous. Weather effects on the windshield are a bit inconsequential and don't look as good as in previous games though.

The game itself is amazing; the force feedback is excellent, the physics are great, the cars sound amazing and are fun as hell to drive, and the stages are perhaps the strongest part of this game. The design of the stages are much more interesting than previous titles by Codemasters or KT. The roads are thinner and more technical, there is much more variation in elevation (more hills and bumps), and the surface degradation makes it more immersive. The scenery is pretty good, but the level of detail varies by location. Some locations are pretty bland, while others have breathtaking mountains in the distance as well as other terrain/scenery that makes them interesting.

Now, there are many issues with this game as well, and it's disappointing they weren't addressed at launch. The career mode has so much potential, but its so so broken...AI are bugged - I'm either 3 minutes ahead or a minute behind (on max difficulty), and sometimes I will win a stage, but somehow I'm like 5 minutes behind the leader?? There is no surface degradation either, even though it shows your running order! Moments also has bugged AI. The only feeling of competition you can really get from playing this game is against other players, and even then, multiplayer lobbies are poorly designed so you end up waiting 10+ mins to drive because the ""ready"" button is hard to find so there is always someone who forgets to press it. Now despite 2/3 of the game being unplayable, there is a LOT of fun to be had in the clubs mode. But that too, has issues. The UI isn't great - it doesn't show you which clubs you have started stages for, or which ones you have completed. I think surface degradation might be missing here too and I also believe clubs could benefit from having the option to apply an even stricter damage model (like RBR). Another small gripe I have is with co-driver detail - so many instances of naturally occurring chicanes that don't get called out and can end your stage if you are carrying speed, late calls, missing don't cuts, etc. However, considering how MANY stages there are and the length of some of them, its sort of understandable, but I hope it gets improved at some point.

In terms of performance, I don't stutter anymore which is good. But the game looks kinda bad at times. Textures are flat and boring, weather like snow and rain looks not super great, and the lighting can be horrible at times. I'd hope the textures are worked on in continuous updates.

Overall, I recommend this to anyone who enjoys competitive rally against other players. The driving itself is damn near perfect, and I have had so much more fun driving in this game than I did in DR2.0. However, if you are looking for a solid single-player experience exclusively - it's not there yet, sadly.

They will suddenly become experts in car physics, game development, exaggerating or just making up stuff, poisoning everything with their incessant whining (don't visit the Steam forums!).

I dislike EA as much as the next person, but come on - this is a Codemasters game. Compared to other A+ launches, the issues really weren't that big. I for one, almost didn't experience any of those stutters, which many people seemed to have. Performance issues have been addressed within a week and they also patched in UDP support.

Other than that it really is chock-full of content. There's more stages than ever and a large variety of cars and game modes to play with. Easily hundreds of hours of fun. Love it

The Bad: Performance can be so choppy even on low I cant play some stages (13700K, 32GB ddr5 ram and RTX4080)

The Review: I have been, like a lot of you, waiting for this game for many years. Dirt 2.0 was legendary and still today one of the best! This game takes it to a different category!!!

First off, tarmac is weak in all rally games so far and EA-WRC has it the best so far! (not counting RBR because so many mods are needed to make it what it truly is) For once, I feel connected to the road! 

Break down:
     Graphics:
The graphics, as expected, are better even than WRC Generations. The terrain feels more detailed and I can read the road and traction better. I dont know if this is also because of the improved driving model, but what I see is more what I expect to feel in my grip and feedback in the wheel.

Even on lower settings, this game still looks amazing. On its highest settings, everything is crisp and the cinematic anti-aliasing makes the pixels disappear. 

Graphics at night are also improved, contrast feels more believable and the headlights actually cast off into the distance!! It seems games never want to project the light as far as you'd expect in real life. The headlights here actually project down the road and dont immediately look like they have a harsh cut off only a dozen yards in front of your car. 


     Driving:

(I have not driven rally in real life. I am an at home sim guy. I dont have a fancy wheel, I have the TM T-248, some pedals and a hand brake. I have no semblance of how this game handles grip compared to real life, so dont come at me, just educate me :D )

Driving in this game feels so much more visceral. Tires bite the ground, throttle and brake are integral to steering the WRC cars through the bends. Air time finally doesnt feel like you are rolling a dice for how your car reacts on a jump. Changes in  surface type can be felt in the wheel and visually immediately and your inputs to control your car feel like you are being listened to, and not guided. (In dirt 2.0 and even wrc generations, it seemed like even with assists off the game was doing more to help you stay in the road #thearcadefactor)

     Music:
I never expected to say this, but the playlist in this game is fire. A lot of the time between stages or the end of a run I end up unintentionally vibing out to the music. It all fits together so well! And the nice touch of keeping the music playing from the menu into your staging area before you start a stage is awesome. It transitions to sound like the music is playing from a speaker system in the staging area!! Small details mean a lot. 

I dunno. I am not a reviewer, I just am hooked and wanted to share what I like about it. Only thing that has annoyed me so far is the VERY sporadic poor performance, but it seems super fixable and a patch has been announced coming to specifically address this so I will update this review after I play in the patch a couple days and many stages to see if it really has improved! 

TL;DR
If you like Rally, or interested in rally, get this. Just get it. Currently frame drops that are supposed to be patched out. Driving is visceral and you feel connected to the road. Gorgeous graphics. Good FFB feel.

EDIT: After the first patch, performance is MUCH better, very playable in the parts that werent. However still has frame drops  where there shouldn't be. So hopefully another patch will fix all that.

Previous Review With Edits:
As the game stands now it needs work. I will change this to recommend as things are improved. Primarily performance.

- Out of the box it is missing UDP/telemetry support. - Fixed. Simhub upate released as well along with Motion software simracing studio
- Performance is poor with stutters coming and going - Large dips impoved, but microstutters remain.
- AI on the hardest difficulty is all over the place. - Unchanged, on their known list
- Seasons just repeat themselves with the same stage order. - Unchanged
- The simulation is fun but needs further work. Grip could be tweaked a tad down. - Overall enjoying it at this point
- I would like improved camera options. Seat position movement has been limited some from dirt rally 2.0 - unchanged, have adjusted to current camera on dash.
- tire management is not as good as WRC generations. - Unchanged
- Note speed need to be improved - Unchanged and seems more stage dependent. Some really messy timing on estonia for example

I think the game looks better than 2.0 on ultra but it’s not much better. 

I do enjoy the game but it’s frustrating it launched with the issues at hand. Obviously if your rally enthusiast your going to get this game I just think for it to be the next Dirt rally 2.0 it has so time to go. 

Lack of VR out of the box is understandable but disappointing. The marketing around the triple screens was unacceptable and I hope they can deliver on their promise to include true triple screen support.",1699033917,1699848421,True,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

There's still plenty of issues, lots of reports of stuttering not fixed by the initial patch and missing features I would have liked to have seen included (like some form of ranked online similar to wrc generations and some daily stages), but the reason I can give this a recommended rating is the driving experience.
Firing one of the Rally1 cars through a stage has never felt better, and there's a plethora of other vehicles which all (which I have tried) feel unique and offer there own challenges. Group B cars feel like they want you to crash at every opportunity, while the rwd historic cars feel like you need to wrestle just to keep them going straight over the games bumpy stages.

Damage is forgiving (even on hardcore damage) and there's a heap of assists to make the game accessible even to newcomers. 
Controls felt good on the short time I tried with a gamepad, and the FFB on my wheel (Simucube 2) feels pretty good after some tweaking.
Performance on my laptop (5800hx with 6800M) at 1080p is a stable 60fps outside of a few areas of specific stages that continue to suffer a little with stuttering, dropping to an avg of around 50fps.

For a hardcore rally experience I would still recommend richard burns rally (RSF), but for something a little less barebones that you can jump in and drive online or against AI, EA WRC is a big thumbs up.",1699832268,1699832268,True,0,2,0,0,True,False,False

After some tuning I am able to run the game smoothly with minimal hiccups.  There are still some input binding issues with my wheel so I am forced to use a keyboard for menu navigation.  If these small quality of life issues are fixed, I would consider this game to be a complete overhaul and step up from Dirt 2.0.  

It is hard to put into words how good the driving feedback is aside from what you feel through the wheel.  The car, the dirt, and the wind get you as close to a real rally experience as you'll get from a sim.  If EA can bring the whole game up to speed, they will be bumping up the bar for all rally sims.

The good
+ Great variety of rally locations (stages' layouts are a bit flat, less intricate, or narrow than in DR2.0) and car rooster. Although I have been unable to test the Renault 5 Turbo due to CTD on every graphics´ setting. I haven´t tested more than a handful of cars. Unsure if more suffer from similar issues.
+ Amazing realistic and involving engine sounds, as per usual with rally titles from Codemasters (""EA""). Clearly the highlight of the game at this point.

The bad
- Graphics, incredibly demanding, yet not looking any better than DIRT Rally 2.0. I don´t see the benefits of Unreal engine. Seems like a much more inefficient system.
- Physics, tires are as unpolished and dumbed-down as in DIRT Rally 2.0. Load sensitivity is not easy to perceive, so can´t create a powerslide at will. Any slip of the tire is either an unrecoverable spin, or abruptly ended, without any balance in between. This in particular is, where a rally title should shine. But this game continues to respond in a very unnatural manner. There´s no way of being smooth into or out of a hairpin. Let alone quick corners in which loss of traction occurs as if one of the tires lifted off the ground (revs go up). Suspension is hard to tune due to unrealistic load and slip behavior from tires.
- Force Feedback, requires quite a bit of fiddling with settings, yet I still can´t feel what the front tires are doing (especially in the ""grubby but clip-friendly tarmac), or how much grip I have left. I can´t drive only feeling when the rear steps out,... and when it does, force feedback simply ""switches-off"". There´s no point of reference on how much counter-steer is required. This might be also linked to the tires' behavior.

The ugly
It´s a real shame that with the potential this title has, that the graphics aren't any better than a five year old game. Let alone the physics, or the sense of ""being there"" driving a rally car as the previous DIRT Rally 1 and 2.0 were better at, even with their own flaws.
It has a ""gamier"" feel to it. It was to be expected being now an official WRC-licensed title it would be less of a sim, but it´s so clearly focused to cater to a wider, less devoted audience, that wouldn't be able to cope with the narrow technical stages, sometimes constantly racing on second gear than DR2.0 had. 
Even if these are all real stages, some of which I've seen in person, the feel of it is of a wider, more forgiving width and less claustrophobic ambient.
It´s a shame, as the licence with all the amazing vehicles, the rally locations, the sound, the UI design and presentation, call for a much better effort than what´s here.

I haven't had much stutters compared to what others say they have, at least not after the patch that enabled shader caching. However it's UE4, which is notorious for its traversal stutter and shader compilation stutter, so it will probably need a few patches to iron it out.

All in all the gameplay is great, and the amount of stages and cars is amazing. A little wooden acting from the manager in career, but who cares. I mainly skip him anyway :D

I like the addition of rally school which, especially for tards like me and new players, can teach you some tricks.

   The most annoying thing is the unexpected, momentary too much grip. Sometimes you don't feel the centrifugal force in a corner at all, you can brake several times and instead of pushing the front out, the car goes straight through the corner. 

   Driving RWD cars is a nightmare, they are oversteer only in random situations. Most of the time they act like AWD or FWD, then suddenly they decide to spin. 

   I love driving RWD cars in Assetto Corsa, Assetto Corsa Competizione, iRacing, Richard Burns Rally and in each of these games, you feel like you are driving RWD right from the start, but not in WRC23.

  If you are a casual player and you like arcade games with nice graphics and career mode, you will like this game. 

  If you care about realism, want to learn how the car behaves on the road in various grip conditions, learning how physics works, and learning the differences between FWD, RWD and AWD cars, choose modern version of Richard Burns Rally modified over the years, for example from rallysimfans.hu or rbrpro.org
P.S. Even F1 and rally driver Robert Kubica said in an interview that he practices playing RBR - seriously.

   Najbardziej wkurw...ająca jest niespodziewana, chwilowa za duża przyczepność. Czasami w ogóle nie czuć siły odśrodkowej, w zakręcie możesz hamować po kilka razy i zamiast wynosić przód na zewnątrz, samochód idzie równo jak po szynach.

   Prowadzenie samochodów RWD jest koszmarem, są nadsterowne tylko w losowych sytuacjach. Przez większość czasu zachowują się jak AWD albo FWD, a nagle postanawiają obrócić się tyłem do przodu. 

   Uwielbiam prowadzić samochody RWD w Assetto Corsa, Assetto Corsa Competizione, iRacing, Richard Burns Rally i w każdej z tych gier, czuć że prowadzisz RWD od samego startu, ale nie w WRC23.

   Jeśli jesteś casualowym graczem, lubisz gry zręcznościowe z ładną grafiką i trybem kariery, ta gra przypadnie Ci do gustu.

   Jeśli zależy Ci na realizmie, chcesz dowiedzieć się jak samochód zachowuje się na drodze w różnych warunkach przyczepności, poznać jak fizyka działa na samochód oraz poznać różnice pomiędzy samochodami z napędem FWD, RWD i AWD, wybierz odświeżoną, modyfikowaną przez lata wersję Richard Burns Rally od np. rallysimfans.hu lub rbrpro.org

I think this title is very promising and you guys did an awesome job so far, and we understand how rush the release can be and how hard you guys have to work to keep quality at impossible deadlines.

Although the game's wonderful in many ways, one thing that's REALLY annoying is the rain and snow particles. It is so far from being realistic that totally ruined the immersion on rainy/snowy situations. 

Please, consider make an update to the rain/snow particle system for WRC, you guys can even use the Evertt Gunther's ""Ultra Dynamic Sky"" from the Unreal's marketplace, which is super realistic and reminds the FH4 quality, right out of the box, it will certainly bring the realism this game deserves.

Another thing, the car headlights at night is not casting shadows, making the night quite overbrighted and dull. We need the light to be ""movable"", casting shadows dynamically, I know that it is possible, I used to work with UE4 (UE5 today).

The performance is not ""there"" yet, but still fun to play. It barely hit 50fps using around 50% of a RTX4090 at 4k max settings DLSS on quality mode, so still has some performance issues to fix.

You guys made history by creating great games in the past, and I'm sure the WRC will be another big one.

While Dirt Rally 2.0 feels like a love project that has been going on since the original Dirt Rally, EA Sports WRC feels like a rushed, low-budget, unfinished game. Although the variety of tracks is nice, the graphics and especially the lighting look very old and of poor quality. The UI design is likewise very boring and unintuitive. The vehicle models are of acceptable quality and their sounds are quite nice. The career mode seems to offer more options, but the fact that increasing the AI difficulty or turning off driving aids does not bring you any benefits reduces the motivation to try harder. Driving physics also seem to have taken a step back; It's not bad on gravel and snow, but the tarmac physics feel very strange and unpredictable.

It's still sensitive to a number of things, and it's not running as smoothly as other titles. But at least it's now playable, which made me revise my review from a big thumbs down, to a cautious thumb up. For me, disabling Steam overlay was necessary, as well as using DLSS only in quality mode, and lowering the other settings to keep the framerate higher than really necessary. Usually, I'm good as long as the framerate is above 60 fps, but here I need around 80 fps for it to be smooth enough. Shouldn't be that way, but at least it's playable.

It still suffers from occasional stutters, inconsistent framerate and frametimes, and can require a bit of tinkering to run smooth enough. But when it does - its content really comes to its right! It's really too bad that a game of this caliber suffers from things like this, making people hate it from the very beginning.

Some better camera adjustment options and proper triple screen would also be nice for us triple users, but the cockpit cameras are at least better suited for this than in DR2. It doesn't shake as much as in DR2 either, making it a less bumpy ride. Good, as some stages in DR2 were practically undrivable because of the shaking.

The cars drive like expected, better than DR2. Asphalt feels much, MUCH better.  Not like RBR, where keeping the car on the road is a satisfying achievement  by itself, but I'm happy with it. The damage is also upped from DR2. Still not ""realistic"" as in rolling=dnf, driving off a cliff=dnf, driving into a tree=dnf, but the car at least suffers enough damage that you will not be able to fully repair it between stages unless you drive carefully. Old and new cars, pretty much all with proper real life liveries. Some old cars are obviously not given as much time and love as the newer ones, but that's understandable. Big thumbs up for the cars.

The stages are varied - some fast and easy, some twisty and narrow. The stages get an unconditional big thumbs up.

I haven't played the career mode, not my type of fun, but both the ""quick play"" and custom championship modes are very good. Initially a bit of a let-down that time trial doesn't let you change weather and stuff, but very understandable, given that it is actually time trial, which requires equal conditions for it to be relevant. Custom championship is my favourite game mode, by far. Very easy to set up a complete season without the need for team management etc.

Very pleased that the game contains all cars, stages etc. unlocked and included from the beginning, no grinding, cumbersome dlc or other cheap tricks - this is the way to release a game! Big thumb up for this.",1699452511,1699706297,True,0,0,0.586851656436920166,0,True,False,False

[b]About Me:[/b] I am a fan of IRL rallying, including the WRC. I have over 1000 hours in DiRT Rally 2.0. I drive with a wheel and pedals, using in-car camera, no HUD, and sequential shifting (I don't have an H-shifter). I try to make my experience as realistic as possible while keeping perspective that it is a game.

[b]Cons (as of mid-November 2023):[/b]
[list]
 [*]No daily, weekly, monthly events. These seem to have been replaced by clubs it seems and ""moments"", which are scenarios like the challenges that were added late to DR2.0. The community (and AI) events were where I spent a ton of time in DR2.0. Time Trails are fun for a bit (I've briefly held World Record times in both this game and DR2.0), but driving a stage on repeat with endless restarts and a pristine car just isn't rallying for me.
 [*]The Career Mode for me is a disappointment. Others may disagree as it's more nuanced than just a straight-forward, ""here's the event - go out and do well."" I'm playing the game to race, not juggle choices of various factors.
 [*]Graphics are a bit hit or miss. Some areas look great. Evening lighting looks great. Mid-day lighting looks too washed out and grainy. Headlights can give kind of the same effect. Water doesn't look great. the replays could be better and some of the plant textures are pretty low quality (and they clip through the bottom of your car when you happen to venture far off the racing line). A lot of textures seem to lack the variability in reflectiveness and ""softness"". This is one area that I hope will improve with time.
 [*]I can't seem to get rid of a couple UI items (maybe I just haven't found the right menu, so this could totally be on me). Looking to turn off the start light countdown in the middle of the screen during races and the speedometer/tach/guage display in the replays.
 [*]Stages seem to lack something - I feel like part of it is the lack of camber in the roads, big stones, unexpected bumps/potholes, variability, etc. The road surfaces just seem a bit too flat. Some of the stages were just a slog to get through of like 1 after 1 after 1, or seemed to be set up in a way to try to catch you out...like long fast sections with maybe some slight curves or 6s, then a sudden square turn. Sure, that's bound to come up sometimes, but some of these stages just felt excessive. Sweden seems a bit neutered compared with the original DiRT Rally or DR2.0. Maybe this will be updated as well, but I'm less hopeful that stages might be re-worked.
 [*]I want more damage. Even on hardcore mode, it's too easy to just pop back onto the stage after a jaunt into the trees. Aero and body panels get destroyed all the time in WRC. Punctures happen frequently and contribute to that damage. Roadside objects (signs, plants, etc.) should have deform damage. Depending on what I hit, it should stop me completely / slow me down greatly and result in major damage / slow me down a bit and result in possible minor damage / be something i can just drive right over. Currently, this seems to be either ""concrete object that is completely immovable (but strangely might not really damage my car too much)"" or ""this object is only there in visual reference only"" - something to drive right on through (to be exploited by people cutting and turning off visuals). I should have trade-offs with risks/rewards - take this jump full speed and get some style points and maybe a faster stage time but in doing that I damage my suspension for future stages. Or I play it safe and don't drive flat-out and maybe don't set the top stage time on every stage, but keep my car together for the duration of the event.
[/list]

[b]""Nuetral"":[/b] [i]My ""meh"" or sorta-good/sorta-bad category[/i]
[list]
 [*]Stage length is much longer. This tests your endurance and concentration over a longer period of time and gets closer to some actual stage rally lengths. I'm hopeful it cuts down on how much I (and the community) end up memorizing stages too. I should need to still rely on my co-driver's pacenotes even after I've played the game a bunch. I'm hoping the plethora of areas will also help with this. As I mentioned, some of the stage design seems a bit lacking, so these longer stages can be a bit of a chore. However, I like the danger they present - do you really want to go flat-out and risk it all - maybe that works on a 2 minute stage, but a 16 minute stage?
 [*]I have mixed feeling on the art direction in the game. The visual style isn't really my thing. Some people my like it though and since it doesn't really change the gameplay, I didn't want to list it as a con.
 [*]I do not care about the car builder or the livery editor. These seem like gimmicks to me - This comes down to my gameplay style though I guess. I'm looking to drive tried and tested real life cars, not make my own goofy parts mobile. I appreciated the mod work that I went into replicating real-life skins/liveries and used that extensively in DR2.0 (I know I was the only one seeing it, but I still enjoyed it). I'm guessing with the half-baked livery editor, there won't be any mod support, but time will tell. I won't be spending my time with that component of the game.
 [*]I miss RX and Hill Climb - Look, I know this is a WRC game, but it's not like those disciplines have enough content to warrant their own completely separate games. Combining them with the original DiRT Rally and DR2.0 was a good fit. Were they my favorite game modes? No. But I enjoyed them immensely. If we can have regulation rallies (which also aren't a WRC thing), then how about these game modes as DLC? I, and certainly others, would love to have them again.
 [*]Speaking of Regulation Rallies - Not really a game mode that I see myself spending much time with, but...I think they are a great way to get people started with the game and rallying. I'd often tell people with DR2.0, don't drive super fast when you're starting out. Focus on driving smoothly. Listen to the calls. Get a feel for how the car handles. I love the game mode for this - get new players focusing on consistency and smooth driving, listen to the instructions and simplified pace notes from your co-driver, then jump into stage rallies and keep improving.
 [*]Co-driver - English male for me, but I wish I had more than just one option in that category. I tried English female, but she sounded robotic (like tin-y or something). How about some more actual co-drivers (Like Phil in DR2.0). Give us some emotion. Give us some varied audio. Give us some changes in cadence/tempo.
[/list]

[b]Pros:[/b]
[list]
 [*]Rally school - Better than the open area freeplay of DirtFish in DR2.0. These guided lessons should help newer players if they actually use them. However, make some more - Explore rear-wheel drive handling vs front-wheel drive and AWD. Explore rear, mid, and front engine layouts. Explore chicanes, cautions and techniques like Scandinavian flicks/advanced weight transfer.
 [*]Loads of cars/classes - Seriously, stop asking for old Toyotas though - pretty sure they don't want some history to be brought up at this point. Where's the DS1/Citroen from the H1 class though?
 [*]Variable seasons - This is huge. Sometimes Monte is dry. Sometimes there's not a ton of snow in Sweden. Sometimes there's snow in Monza (I know it's not on the calendar this year or in the game, but you get my point). This adds so much variation and re-playability to the game.
 [*]I am hopeful for more content coming soon - Central European Rally (Czech, Germany, Austria) was a thing in WRC this year. Poland is back on the WRC calendar next year. Latvia will be new to WRC in 2024.
 [*]Varying width of stages. Some stages are super narrow, like in real life, and there is no room to go wide and wild.

-The cars dont sound as good as they do in dirt rally 2.they are lacking oomph (the only car i found that really sounds as good seems to be the golf 2) 
-WRC was stuttering like hell and the first few stages i took a look at, where really wide and flat. 
-Theres an issue with the exposure. the road can be blindingly bright. especially in cockpitview. (this is REALLY annoying / distracting and atmosphere killing for me)

So i was ready to bash the game, BUT:

-stuttering is nearly completely gone now, after shaders had time to compile (patch is coming)
-driving gets more fun with every hour i put in. the stages are a really big step up and there are so many cool combinations of track / weather. 

even though the sounds might not be as brutal as in dirt rally and im driving in bonnetcam to atleast kind of fix the exposure-issue that occurs in cockpit....i still highly recommend WRC to anyone that loves dirt rally 2 or wants to get into rally. (i cant talk about career / builder stuff though, since i only care for clubs and time trials)


TLDR: it took me 5-10 hours to really start liking WRC, but now i cant imagine to go back to DR2

Edit: a few things that bother me after 45hours:
-you cant go back to service to save your cars setup after you beat your time/rival in time trial.
-you cant see the remaining time on each club without choosing it first and going back afterwards will take you to the very first club instead of staying on the one you clicked on. 
-clubs are not even in a chronological order.
-you cant change your fov for the dashcam.
-i see reflections of my instruments and even the pedals of my codriver in the windshield when driving the stratos in cockpit view.
-the group a impreza sounds really weird in cockpit.
-the pacenotes seem to be a bit off sometimes. not calling out really important cuts to avoid. another CAUTION, or DONT CUT wouldnt hurt. its rare but it can be a really frustrating run-ender.
-you have to deactivate the ghost every single time you start a time trial by picking a friends time from the main menu. you have to start, then pause, disable the ghost and then you can drive. every. single. time.",1699003717,1699632119,True,2,0,0.49995085597038269,0,True,False,False

This game is not merely an attempt at capturing the spirit of rallying; it is a masterful ode to the artistry and skill required to navigate treacherous terrain at breakneck speeds.

The first thing that strikes one about this title is its sheer breadth of content. With a plethora of cars and tracks to choose from, players are given ample opportunity to hone their skills and explore the limits of their abilities. From the sleek, powerful machines of the World Rally Championship to the more humble yet nimble vehicles of local rallying events, there is something for everyone here.

But it's not just about the quantity; it's also about the quality. Each car handles with a unique blend of power and finesse, requiring players to adapt their driving style accordingly. The tracks themselves are meticulously crafted, each twist and turn designed to test the driver's ability to read the road ahead and make split-second decisions under pressure.

What really sets EA WRC apart from its competitors, however, is its commitment to authenticity. This game isn't just about racing; it's about the culture and spirit of rallying. From the thrill of the finish line to the camaraderie of the pit crew, every aspect of the sport has been painstakingly recreated with a level of detail that is truly impressive.

In short, EA WRC is not just a game; it's an experience. It invites players to step into the shoes of a rally driver and feel the adrenaline rush through their veins as they navigate treacherous terrain at breakneck speeds. And with its wealth of content and commitment to authenticity, it's an experience that won't soon be forgotten.

Just try the wheel setup with a tamarc stage to see that there is no real wheel integration in this game. No matter what you do, the angle of the wheel is not aligned with the direction the front tyres are facing. The steering wheel input is apparently interpreted and scaled like a button. This makes the simulation feel more like a rudder than a steering wheel. This manifests itself in unnaturally low steering angles in long, tight bends.
The stutters are also still there, after the ""1.3.0"" patch, which is displayed in the game as 1.2.0. I also lost my savegame due to the patch because the game says I no longer have the gamepass and therefore the seasons. 
There is no real multi-monitor support in this sim (omg, it's 2023!!), my H-Shifter has to be calibrated after every start of this messy game because it shatters the controller drivers. 
The whole thing is a joke, but not a simulation. Maybe nice with a gamepad if you can stand the average graphics, sound and this grotty user interface, but nothing for hardcore sim fans. As a sim fan, simply don't buy Codemaster games. The German voice-over is unintentionally funny, as the stage introductions were apparently recorded by former German Chancellor Angela Merkel. What a waste of time and money. Shame on you EA and Codemaster, you are worthless!
A word of advice: get rid of a few marketing people and hire real software engineers instead. I mean ones who can really programme, not just stick things together in editors in a rudimentary way.

Update:
I think I can say that I feel some approvements in comparision to Dirt Rally 2.0. So with:
- same ingame and wheelside settings (Fanatec CSL DD)
- graphics Ultra (default, so some are High)

FFB:
- I feel more in connection with the road, but the road itself feels less ""roady""?

Visual:
- graphics look better (more sharp), but color less vivid
- not much sense of speed (could be my own lack of... ;) )
- sometimes minor studder

- force feedback settings do what they should (alreadt found ffb settings for CSL DD)
- Graphically demanding, but with some tweaks I should be ready for the VR update !!
- Rally School is a nice addition
- Official cars all the way (WRC, DR, historical etc)

The game loaded fine and besides the occasional stutter I enjoyed the feel of the physics, Not quite the loose feeling of DiRT, but I was able to play a few races and I do see a huge amount of potential. I owned the game for three hours before refunding. I'd say half of that time was spent trying to figure out why the car builder and livery designer wasn't working. I have a GTX 1070, so not the best GPU, but no matter what settings I chose I still had graphical issues in and out of races. After tabbing to a browser and doing a little research I found this is a common issue for GTX GPU's. Unfortunately Its not a problem I'm OK with purchasing for $49.99. I would not have refunded if the Price was $20-$30, which is usually early access price for similarly ambitious titles. I may repurchase in the future, either when its on sale, or is a polished title. I personally think It needs alot of work in the graphics area, fine tuning to the physics, adjustment of the AI, And complete overhaul of the car builder.

UPDATE 11-9-2023: Telemetry enabled. It is a brand new JSON files based UDP control scheme, Very modular and Simhub now supports EA Sports WRC so setup was a click for me, depends on what software telemetry is going to. Spent a couple of hours dialing it in and it is subtle, granular and awesome.

Driving sits between RBR and DR 2.0, closer to RBR. Way less ""game"" car from DR 2.0 and more real car. Less forgiving. Probably not playing RBR again for a good long time.

Stages. Pretty much Rally fan paradise. 600km, more coming. It never ends and it is what I was waiting for.

Modes. SO many modes. Not dailies though oddly. Maybe later.

Single player has quick play for RANDOM championships as well as create a championship and career and time trial.

Multiplayer has Clubs and championships.

Builder. Build a rally car then see how you do.

Livery designer. Tart up your ride.

Menu and UI, basic and utilitarian as it should be. EA is in the corner and does not distract from rallying and also included one hell of a soundtrack this time.

Still waiting for VR and telemetry and frankly a bit nervous about VR with the new engine, but as a dedicated VR-hole I have played 32 hours in pancake. It's that good. You need at least two or four stages, at least one on each surface type to fully appreciate what this game brings. Yes tarmac feels like tarmac now and not very grippy smooth gravel like before.

SUPER strong launch! This has some bugs and needs a patch or two. However I can say with confidence if you got no other Rally game ever and only this one you chose wisely. Some of the others might still do one or two things ""better"" (subjective) but WRC does so much so right right now and it will only get better with free DLC coming.

The game is not bad, but it is not good either. Therefore I can't recommend it to rally fans.

Apart from the performance and stuttering issues, there are very many other aspects of the game that leave rally fans disappointed.

Handling: all of the cars seems to handle very similarly to the Rally1 cars, but with the speed, grip level adjusted. Very quick to turn in, especially if on the brakes, but then very snappy when sliding sideways.

Stage details: since all of the time is being spent looking at the stage surface, it leaves very much to be desired. Surface lacks real-life looking details.

Codemasters, this game's developer has a long history of making rally games. I played the first Colin McRae Rally on PS One in 1998 and a lot of rally games since then. The two Dirt Rally games have set a high bar that Codemasters had to match or surpass with their new game. In this regard, they failed. That said, I will discuss if EA Sports WRC is a good rally game nontheless.

[h2]Technical state[/h2]

Unfortunately the games optimization leaves to be desired. On a high end system there are, even after the first patch, loading stutters and huge frame rate drops on specific stages and conditions, especially at night. These issues are not game breaking but they hurt the immersion and are hard to justify regarding the mediocre graphics. 

[h2]Driving[/h2]

But the game delivers in the most important aspects. the driving is satisfying and it is a joy to drive the different vehicle types. Anyone who played the Dirt Rally titles knows what to expect of the handling. The driving physics are realistic without loosing accessibility out of sight. Though, it needs to be said that this game is not a hardcore simulation. Those who are looking for that, will have to play Richard Burns Rally.

[h2]Content[/h2]

EA Sports WRC has a lot to offer content wise. 17 locations, 200 stages, 78 Cars and the option to play most of the locations on Spring, summer, autumn and winter. This and the addition of various weather conditions offer a lot of replayability. Then there are the usual modes like Career, Custom Championship, Time Trial, etc.

Trust me, I wasn't. 

I acknowledge that this game isn't perfect. It's not a full blown sim racer, but neither was Dirt Rally. The performance isn't perfect, but more than fine. *

*5700X + 3060 + 32gb of ram = ~80fps on Ultra settings (DLSS on Quality)
If you have genuine performance problems, set foliage (trees, ground cover, etc) down to low or ultra low. Trees specifically seem to have the highest performance impact.

It doesn't have many multiplayer components, but it also really doesn't need it.
On top of all of that, it's not a $70 title either, even though it more than feels like one. 
This game is good, it is a lot of fun, and if you've enjoyed Dirt Rally 2.0 or the previous WRC games, you will love this one.

The driving on a Logitech G29 is very good, responsive and fun. Playing on a controller is great, too. Both of which feel good enough as to not overshadow the other, though a wheel will always be superior out of sheer feedback.

 Older cars feel sluggish and sometimes need to be kicked to turn and whipped to drive straight, newer cars are aggressive and snappy while going through sharp corners in third gear. I can't speak much for enthusiasts wheels, but on consumer grade wheels it works like a charm.

With this out of the way, my actual gameplay experience has been EXTREMELY positive.
There is so much content, so many cars, they all sound INCREDIBLE (with two exceptions)
The stages are fun to drive, the variety is insane, the handling is Dirt Rally 2.5 (with most of it's quirks), the career is super fun.

The fact that the game HAS a career mode in the first place is incredible! In a world where all racing games (Dirt Rally 2.0 included) have a one persistent savegame per account career, this is such a breath of fresh air and will have me back starting over from square 1 many times, just to see what I could do differently, just so I could challenge myself again by maximizing profits or minimizing staff expenses.

The career mode may lack a bit of management depth in comparison to the Kylotonn WRC games, but in comparison to Dirt Rally 1 and 2? Stunning.
This is one of my new favorite racing games, BY FAR. Codemasters have outdone themselves, even going as far as to let you use a livery editor much in the same vein as Forza.

The monetisation aspect is something that surprised me as well. Promising one additional Rally post release, for free, is amazing. I'll happily buy skins or other cosmetic things for this game, if it allows others to enjoy the best racing game to have released this year.

Codemasters have done a fairly good job at emulating how a rally car reacts to road surfaces in this entry despite still using there pivot point centre axis and it generally feels considerably more sim like than dr2, despite this it does have some glaring issues, the vehicles themselves all feel as if they have an unearthly amount of grip at all times, enough that it can occasionally break the immersion, the suspension also feels very numb and lacks the visceral shaking that would be powering a 300hp monster through the dense woodlands that dr2 did so well, I feel like this game is the closest a big budget rally title has ever gotten to Richard burns rally NGP physics  and definitely is superior to dr2.

Games that lean heavily into sim tend to be No Fun. WRC has traditionally been a 50/50 split and this latest release from Codemasters leans slightly more towards sim, but still maintaining that WRC accessibility. Let's be honest, most players will be on a console using a controller. This game is for them and not so much for simrigs.

I'm playing this on the lounge TV with an Xbox controller. It feels polished. It doesn't feel a lot like Dirt to be honest. I'd have thought this was just going to be the next Dirt Rally but that's not the case. This is it's own thing. The distinction is the career and builder features. The game isn't just about the racing, it's also about managing your team and resources to win the most comps. That's WRC in a nutshell and I love it.

Racing is obviously the core of this game and as I said earliier it's arcade-y no denying that, but it's also not casual. You need to use rally-like skills to get around the stages. Things like weight shifting, throttle control, vehicle tuning, suspension and tyres, they all matter. There's also a clear difference in the handling between RWD, FWD and 4WD on the various road surfaces. There's only so much they can do with a controller rather than a proper simrig, but it feels like I'm in control of a real car. Obviously that can't be true, with a controller there must tonnes of auto-help going on, but it's subtle and doesn't takeover.

Level designs are fantastic. The mountains of Croatia with sheer drops over massive cliffs, or the plains of Kenya with barely any vegetation, they really put you in the moment. I play the in-cockpit view which limits your visibility - that's the way I like to play rally games - and sometimes you go over a crest and lose sight of the track, so you're relying on visual cues like the trees to figure out where the road is underneath the car. I love that. It has this roller-coaster feeling. A moment of terror as you put your faith in the co-driver and hope for the best. It's also unforgiving of even the slightest mistakes. Too much throttle on a corner and unbalance the car and next thing you're over the cliff and into the trees. This game rewards practice and skill and more practice.

Negative points for using Unreal Engine because it stutters due to shader compilation. After a while it caches so it's an annoying feature of UE but ultimately doesn't matter. It's a resource hog though. I bought a 7900XT to play this game and it's still not enough for Ultra.

On nov. 8. there was an update to version v1.2.0, which brought in a way better physics, I think better than of Dirt Rally 2.0. Now a small mistake while accelerating or braking and you spin. Powerslides are now suddenly possible, and both tarmac and asphalt feels great. Jumping is also much better, you can feel the weight of the car when in the air, and when landing. Weight transfer also works now and feels realistic. Not sure why, but now it feels alright. If I had to guess, maybe turning off all the assists didn't work in the previous version due to some bug...who knows?? This makes me now having to definitely recommend this game to any sim fan, although there are still many things to fix.


*** ORIGINAL REVIEW ***
Dirt Rally and Dirt Rally 2.0 are much closer to simulation than EA Sports WRC. I can easily drive any car with keyboard with all assists turned off, which was not the case for the Dirt Rallies, or for Richard Burns Rally. The cars are sticking to the road, and it is difficult to make a mistake and fly off the track. The road surface feels uniform; you can safely accelerate or brake for example with the left wheels off the road in the dirt or grass and the right weels on asphalt with good grip, you will not have to do much counter steering. The same goes for snow and wet asphalt on Monte Carlo. The gravel roads for example in Greece look flat like a mirror. This was also much more realistic in DR and DR2 with those uneven bumps (not talking about surface degradation, but the intact surface itself). The game sometimes stutters, even if I set the graphics to low, but at least I could find the optimal settings. On an RTX 3080 Ti in 4K on ultra preset the the frame rate was 50-60 FPS. By setting the car reflection and mirror quality to the lowest values, the frame rate increased by 50-70%, basically without any visual drawback (except that you don't have a reflection in the side view mirrors).

EA Sports WRC looks good, sounds great, but it is arcadey, therefore not challenging for me (and for many people). For this you don't need a steering wheel, a controller is enough. I think it was not fair to advertise it with WRC pilots as so realistic and with improved physics compared to the predecessor, Dirt Rally 2.0. The physics was not improved, only simplified. I expected a better physics than of Dirt Rally 2.0, but this is just a step back. Unfortunately the arcadey physics removes the essence of the game.",1699131451,1699483586,True,0,0,0.52478492259979248,0,True,False,False

In my opinion the most important is that handling and driving in general feels really great I'm playing with an ancient (1999) Microsoft Sidewinder wheel and it works like a charm with force feedback too!

Gameplay wise my biggest complaint is some tracks a bit too long and plain for my liking.
The career mode is alright (don't expect too much) And the car builder and livery editor is a bit basic but a nice addition.

Overall it's a fun rally game with a lot of potential, I hope EA doesn't plan this as a one-shot yearly release and we got long term support with new features, content etc.

Since patch 1.3 the graphical performance is significantly better than it was at launch. 
From 40-50 FPS average now I get 70-80 FPS average. I still have a bit of screen tearing here and there also a few times the game still feels a bit ""laggy"" but overall it's much more enjoyable now!

Great driving experience. Great improvement on tarmac. Highly responsive grip and not ""floaty"". Realistic looking and feeling stands. Rewarding feel and when you crash you know why and it feels logical.

The fps and performance have a long way to go. I run on a 3060ti on medium graphics and it still drops sometimes to the level that makes you crash or make a mistake. The graphics don't even look good for a ""next gen game""  on ultra.

Career mode is fun but lacking a bit in options. You are unable to play as an employed driver. Always liked this in F1 games. Fighting for contracts to move up in series or to better teams.

Also, the benefactor system is made so that you will have to drive a lot of different series to make them happy. I would like to choose to not have to do this.

... to make a better rally game than DR2. Of course, since EA was involved, there was no chance to be any different.
First, in DR2, I almost exclusively drive (classic and GT)  RWD (Rear Wheel Drive) cars with some occasional 4WD/AWD cars, mostly classic. 
All other cars are far too easy to drive and represent no challenge at all. Of course, I only drive on gravel and occasionally snow. So, this review is strictly from the perspective of RWD cars.
So, as you can imagine, when WRC became available, I jumped right into Greece rally with Lancia Stratos, which is very challenging to drive.
I used Technical FFB settings for my CLS DD, which are quite good. Of course, I disabled all the assists.
So, how was a drive? Simply, disappointing. Too much arcade-ish, too much grip, too little understeer or oversteer. No challenge at all. You just point the wheels in required direction and the car more or less follows. On dry track and on wet track, not much difference. Sliding through the corners, very enjoyable in DR2, is very badly simulated in WRC. Playing with diffs dis not make much difference. Car behaviour was simply strange. Fortunately, (some) breaking is still required :).
I tried few other gravel stages, like Sardegna, Mexico, Estonia, Kenia and Oceania, also with other RWD cars, but bad experience did not improve. Some cars are little better, but not much. RWD cars physics is totally off.
Rally school is much worse than one in Dirt 4. If you want to learn driving, try that one instead. There are different surfaces available (in WRC school), but only one car. There is also no coaching or detailed instructions available, how to drive. Also, there is no training ground available, like Dirtfish in DR2. There is no place where you can play with the cars and try differenct settings.  
Graphics is definitely a step forward, I got steady 80+ fps on my 1920x1200 monitor with 3060Ti on High. Stages are nicely done, and some are very long.
Early reviewers on YT mostly praised ""fun factor"". I don't deny, it is fun to drive at the beginning, but challenging, no, it is not. And unfortunately, fun quickly becomes boredom. Endless winding roads, where you just need to do some breaking and turn the wheel. Almost no throttle control, no weight shifting, no counter-steering required. As said, boring.
Fun means arcade, challenge means sim. No, EA WRC is not a sim, not even a simcade, it's a plain arcade, even on hardest settings. Is DR2 a sim? Not, it is not, but it is (much) more sim than an arcade.
I somehow understand EA position, they want to attract as much players as possible, rally fans and also those, who don't care much about rally. But they failed miserably. Real rally fans are already dissapointed or will soon be, the others will quickly become bored and go back to Call of Duty.  
So, after 5+ hours of EA WRC boring disappointment, I will go back to DR2 and start my beloved Te Awanga Wet in Lancia 037.

Firstly: 
If this is your first Rally game and you have not played Dirt Rally 2 then you will likely enjoy it.  It works great with controller, although I would have liked Ps5 controller support on PC as no longer have space for my wheel.
If you are only bothered about the feel of the car and not the bulk of a career, look at DR2.

Pros: 
1. Performance gripes are fixable by spending some time in the settings.  I got solid frame rates and and smooth running game.  Use big picture mode on Steam as for racing games I always get a better experience.
2. Career mode is nicely fleshed out and makes you feel invested.
3. Builder is cool but would like different chasis choices as the stock ones are too short and high.
4. Cars feel fast and the stages look great overall.

Cons:
1. All tracks, without exception are too smooth and are not engaging.  The car is always stable unless you clip an edge, I don't feel the need to tune springs and dampers to help me.
2. Handling feels off.  Tonnes of grip in some sections and snappy behaviour back to centre on an irritating basis ... this was the last straw to me uninstalling.
3. This gave me motion sickness, DR2 does not.

I really wanted to enjoy this but am going back to DR2.

Great that Codemasters are involved with Rally games again, you can feel their impact in a good way.
WRC games for the past few years have been very disappointing.

- The UI is a typical EA/Codemasters mess that doesn't know if it wants to be for consoles or PC and ends up not working well for anything. Some buttons are labelled for keyboard and others for a controller, I'm using a wheel and bound all the relevant buttons yet still get told I need to use F1 on my keyboard or click some inconsistent spot with my mouse. Tabs can't be switched to unless you back out of the tab you are in, meaning things take one or two extra presses than they need to.

- My wheelbase is not detected every time I start the game, yet it says so in the options. When I start a race I have to recalibrate the wheel before it responds and then miraculously whirs into life. Fortunately it manages to remember all my bindings. FFB didn't work until I pasted part of the config file from Dirt 2 into the config file for WRC. (Moza base, but also same issue with a Simcube setup)

- Graphics are a mess. Night stages are nearly impossible to do as the bizarre glare on the road/track is so bad it induces a headache after five minutes. This weirdness is still there in day stages but is not as bad. It looks like a TAA issue, but you can't change that in-game. There's some horrendous pop-in during replays especially.

- Stages are hit and miss, some are really good and fun, Spain for example, but others have obviously had zero Q&A, like the Jungle Rally (Indonesia) and Sweden. Snow acts like a brick wall when in reality you'd plough throw it, there are bushes that are solid blocks - again like a wall - that you'd just drive through or destroy. The game sorely needs even a small amount of destructible objects at the roadside. Outside of Finland, the much hyped road wear and variation is non-existent, you can drive last and the road is as flat and featureless as if you are going first.

- Career mode is a copy and paste job from the F1 games, even down to the fake icons and badges you get. The engineer never shuts up and even tells you to ""take a look"" at stuff you've literally just dealt with - repairs for example. The car designer is okay, but mostly just cosmetic, so unlocking things has very little if any performance benefit - there's no parts tech tree.

- FFB and car physics are again hit and miss. It's better on tarmac than DR2, but snow is really poor, gravel is ok. Some cars are certainly more refined than others, the actual WRC cars have been done quite well, but some of the other cars just seem like quick ports from DR2/1 that haven't been tested. Still feels as if the cars are floating a little on the road surface.

- Audio is pretty good generally. Sound changes if your door falls off for instance, which is nice. The music is really annoying unless you like that ""middle of the road 40-year old uncle wanting to be cool style dance music"". Music is best muted.

- You don't need an EA account, or to use EA Play if you don't want to. Some features are locked behind being logged into it but at the moment none of that is important.

If you're on the fence about this and already have DR2 then wait until this has got a few months of patches behind it before checking it out again. If some of the glaring issues with the gfx, wheelbases, and stages are fixed then it will be ok, but right now it's one to avoid.",1699021895,1699468683,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Rest of the game is okay, feels good with some surfaces still being floaty and grip being crazy snappy on certain areas.

I can now safely say I love this game! DR 2.0 is my favourite rally game overall so I had high hopes for this. EA and Codemasters have done a great job and you have to give props when it's due.
All peripherals are working at launch, tons of rallies, great graphics, good online mp support, all the cars you will need and the amazing sound is there as well to help with that immersion!

I wasn't sure how this was going to go with EA taking over but as I said this games is superb. The most important thing the handling! For me yes it's a little less punishing than DR 2.0 but it still requires good skill and practice to master stages. Oh, and speaking of stages they have some really really long stages if that's your thing. Personally I prefer shorter to medium ones but there is something for everyone!

Finally the stuttering issues for me seem to have gone away completely but EA have confirmed they working on and update which will hopefully fix this for everyone still experiencing it.

And in  the since that it lacks realisam and the good things that came from DR 2.0 (witch in my opinion is a much batter of a game ) . It's not that good.

Good things about the game:
- ther is a great deal of stages to drive
- ther is a selection of cars to drive
- your own team

Bad things about the game :
- it isn't as nice looking as DR 2.0 
- cars feel like thay have to much grip 
- game gliches and it is not good for a game that needs good reflexes
- certain cars sound to week or to silent
- Cars with no assists feel like thay are runing all the assists , wich is like?????

Game Need a lot of live from EA witch im wored about couse EA like money and if the game dose not make money for them , they will leave it .
Fix the game and it will be good , please ;)

please add RPM's to the WRC's couse it is just useful.

Pros: Ton of content. Lots of cars, lots of stages. Loving the long distance stages. Tarmac physics have definitely improved upon Dirt Rally 1.0 and 2.0, but there is still some room for improvement. Career mode is pretty cool, I'm more of a multiplayer kinda simracer so I haven't dove too deep into it, but on the surface I love the idea of how it works. Despite some of drawbacks to the realism/sim aspect of the game, it is still challenging but not punishing. 

Cons: It's not the most realistic, there is a ton of grip which I feel may have been an EA initiative to make the game more appealing to the general audience rather than to please the simracers. The lack of damage is pretty disappointing...but again, WRC License + EA so can't say I'm too surprised. AI is inconsistent. Super slow on some stages, alien pace on others, which really hurts the immersion of a functional rally race. Lastly, definitely some performance issues. There are frame drops and massive stutters, which can be detrimental to your run. Hopefully these issues get ironed out, but I wouldn't call it game breaking.

All in all, I think this is an excellent rally game. If you're looking for something super realistic or even closer to a sim, I wouldn't say this the best title. RBR remains king. But I do think this is an improvement on DR2.0, and what I would call a simcade that is a blast to drive without sweatin' too hard. If you've never played a rally game before and looking to get into it, this is a phenomenal choice, an excellent stepping stone.

I hope there will be performance updates because you simply can't have stutters and low FPS throughout an entire race when you need split-second reactions. There's no excuse for this given the, I assume, bigger budget from EA, and I think some of it may be due to using Unreal Engine, which just wasn't designed for driving/racing games/sims. 

Visually I think so far it's a noticeable and disappointing downgrade from Dirt 2.0, with gaps in the road texture and less track detail than before. Everything besides the cars look kinda shitty for current year, even with all graphics settings on ultra.  

The team management shit is out of place and only serves to take more time away from driving. But of course it's something EA likes to do with it's games, from what I can tell, and they seem to think it will add more to the experience when it really doesn't. We're here to race, not fiddle with team members and worry about a budget or meeting sponsor goals. 

The car building is kinda neat, but all the options are disappointing and you only have one frame to add to.

It also needs options to configure triple-screen setups because the angles between each monitor are wonky, and there's a jump from one screen to the next which makes objects passing by do weird things.

Dirt Rally 2.0 was a great game but it needed an update - and EA's WRC absolutely delivered. 
The game feels exactly like DR2 and it feels like they built WRC off of the DR2 engine.
It does have some performance kinks but nothing that breaks the game (for me at least). 

PROS: 
- New cars (You can find a list somewhere through a google search)
- GROUP B CARS!! 
- So many new maps/locations 
- Updated graphics 
- Time Trial has leaderboards! (DR2 had leaderboards but it was horrible to use) 
- A ""Rally School"" that coaches new players on the various techniques used in rally. 

CONS: 
- Other players have commented on this: there is some lag when playing a map for the first time. It seems like the game loads sections of the map at a time and you'll get some FPS lag for a brief moment. Once the game is loaded up in your cache, it's no longer an issue. Additionally, I found that turning down the graphics reduces the severity of the lag and it's barely noticeable to me now. (Highest -> Medium). I believe the devs also released an update (11/3) to address this issue with limited success.
- No Rallycross (not a big deal for me, I love the traditional rally. Some might care) 
- Career Mode only focuses on modern era cars (Give me the Group B Career mode!!)

Let me clue you guys in: This game needs an SSD (even a cheap one will do, they're about the same price as the game and you should have one anyway in 2023. The reason EA decided not to precompile shaders is because some of these tracks are 10+ km long, and having everything pre-done would mean a hell of a longer loading time (think about triple.) Secondly, if you have problems running the game even off an SSD and have all the most modern hardware out there, please, please, please, make sure you're using the APPROPRIATE upscaling method for your graphics card. I'm on a 3060 and therefore use DLSS. If you use AMD's upscaling on an NVIDIA graphics card chances are you're not gonna get the performance you look for. 

All that aside, the game is stunningly beautiful even on low graphics. The FFB is a bit weak for my liking but that may be because I'm on a belt-fed wheel. The tracks are fun and engaging, and the surfaces feel very well done.

Stuttering from shader compilation that never seems to go away no matter how many times I run the same stage, and bland visuals to rub salt in the wound. No way to bind steering wheel buttons to menu items like pause. The game's menus are a disaster to navigate by mouse, clearly designed around console and buggy as all heck with things like the scroll wheel, but with the added insult of an inability to use any wheel controls to replace the mouse interactions. I'm using my keyboard arrow keys to get around....just...what the heck. Damage and effects like dirt just don't have any visual impact on your car during a stage, like the manufacturers didn't allow Codemasters to implement anything resembling detailed visual damage models. Stage lengths are a plus, and I'm sure I would enjoy them if I ever got the chance to complete one without horrific stuttering that, in a rally game where you need 90+ FPS to be competitive on higher difficulties, is almost an instant crash every time it happens at speed.

This product needed more time in the oven and I hope it will get turned around soon, but why it even had to be this way is a mystery.

Maybe the inexperience from Codemasters with that engine?

Edith No.2: Now that I've played sometime I'm a bit disapointed by the quality of the tracks. It's a hit and miss kinda thing. Not just a little amount of tracks feel rushed and it can't reach the quality of tracks from Dirt Rally 2.0 or the last WRC titles done by Kylotonn Racing.

At least on a controller. I especially like the weightiness of the cars. Getting up on two wheels and coming down again feels as it should, contrary to the floatiness of WRC Generations. 

The graphics are good, although the game won't win any awards for the way it looks. It gets the job done. Some stages really do give you a wide view across larger distances. So you often get the feeling you are driving through a real place. So that's nice to have. Although the stages could use a bit more liveliness in terms of things happening around you. Stuff like moving animals, camera helicopters, and people moving about the places you pass by in your car. The sound design, however, is fantastic. The driving sounds nice and raw in terms of things like the rattling of gravel onto the sump guard, as well as the engine. Co-driver pacenotes are mixed in nicely as well. Big plus that helps a lot with the immersion!
The game has plenty of locations and stages to race through, although the lack of super special stages is a letdown. But I can't complain about the amount of content on offer here. There's even some 30+ km long stages, which is quite rare for a rally game. It also has all the rally cars from all ages you would want, and you can even build your own now!

The AI times needs to be tweaked a little bit to make the campaign difficulty a bit more even across all stages, that's my major gripe with the game. And the game can stutter the first time you are running a new stage on some locations. If necessary you can quit the current stage, or ALT+F4 the game if quitting is not available, to restart without losing any attempts if you are hampered by this issue. 
Another downside is the fact you can't do any real tire management. There's no way to replace tires in between of stages, and actually use your spares like a real rally driver would. You also can't do cross patterns, or take a mix of different tire compounds with you for the loop. This breaks the immersion a bit for me, although non-rally fans probably won't notice this. Still, this was handled much better in WRC Generations.

In any case, this is probably the best driving game of the year. Currently the best way to virtually enjoy the ultimate form of motorsports. Getting some old school Colin McRae Rally vibes from this one.

There were a few issues on day one with stuttering, wierd graphics and bugs, but since its been pretty good with only occasional stutters every now and then on certain stages, nothing major and rarely.
I have a 5800x3d and a 3060 and i just put the game in medium, its running smoothly and looks great now.
It feels like DR2.0 in many ways gameplay wise just with extra cars and stages, with a whole lot of fun to go with it. The ability to choose seasons and change the weather is great. 
The menus im not a fan of personally but that may be just me, it feels more difficult  to get to all the tuning sections for instance.
Force feedback feels good, my wheel just worked straight away, although the menu button binding was a bit wonky. I did have to roll back my wheel driver as i lost force feedback for some reason but now works fine, not sure what the issue was but i do also have to do this for wreckfest so it may be a thrustmaster issue.
Cant really comment on career yet as i have not started it, ive just been doing clubs and time trials, i will update my review once ive given it a try.

Well.... that's too bad, its not here, what you will find here is a dumbed down version of DiRT Rally with a lot of different new things no-one really cares about.

Car builder? Yeah, you can select like 3 engines and some bumpers, that's mostly it.
New stages? Kinda, its 2 or 3 long stages, cut up into 2 smaller stages, drive them back and forth and boom, you got 9 stages (like in DiRT) so it takes about a few hours to get to know all the stages.

Force feedback is designed to give you a feeling about what the car is doing, how the car reacts to the surface below it. They completely butched it up in this game, it feels the same every single corner.

Cars feel like they are floating, as in the other WRC games, i get the feeling the only real input codemasters had on this game was the stages...

The UIs are boring and all look the same, it has this corporate minimalistic look to it, the exact same corporate minimalistic look that all their FiA games have had since F1 2020. Everything is a mess hidden inside a thousand menus, but at least unlike F1, you can skip much of the bs by just mashing A/X.

The character ""creator"", if you can call it that, is the same as it always been, where you pick from a selection of people then a cringy nickname. Here, however, we see a major improvement in past Codemasters games; the women no longer look like inbred troglodites.
Instead, they were replaced with sentient bobbleheads, proving yet again that women are in fact, not real, as seen by modern developers' inability to understand concepts such as ""Sexual dimorphism"" and ""Basic anatomy"".

The graphics are really average for a 2023 game, specially one as demanding as this one. A lot of the stuttering complaints in the reviews is just DirectX 12 generating the shader cache as you play, which is a really poor decision instead of precaching shaders, considering this game is as demanding as it is.
I'm playing on a 5800x3D, a 3080Ti and 1080p resolution, my FPS varies wildly from 80s to 40s depending on stage.

The gameplay is by far the worst part. This game can't keep my attention for a whole minute in a race before my mind wanders off. The driving is boring, the audio is boring and the Co-pilot is actively trying to put me to sleep, probably hoping that if we drive head-on into a tree, all his problems at home will disappear. Seriously, this game should be used as an example of how monotony is a trigger for dangerous driving.

The only good thing about this game is that, after playing Rally games for over a decade and being put into a deep thought by how absolutely bland everything in this game is as I mindlessly drove through stage after stage, finishing a whole minute ahead of my opponents every time, I finally realized, in a moment of quiet reflection brought upon by my depressed Co-pilot, that the single digit numbers in the pacenotes are actually gear numbers.

If you like Dirt Rally 2.0, you'll probably like this. That said, I feel its biggest weaknesses are also related to DR2. The handling is still not quite there. Cars rotate too easily and grip feels awkward because they unnaturally pivot around center mass regardless of the grip at the tires, if you're stuck against a wall or barrier, try and steer away and watch the rear of the car smack it if you don't believe it. Asphalt was always where this showed in DR2 and it's equally true here. That said, on well... dirt, it feels accurate enough to provide a lot of fun. So far, the career mode is fun, the addition of a car builder is really cool, and progressive unlocks for the car builder through completing events is genuinely nice to have and gives reason to take on more challenges. 

Graphically, it's a mixed bag, the car models are good, but parts of the environments, even with settings completely maxed, really don't feel like a big enough step considering a 4 year gap and the move to a new engine. Weather effects (snow in particular) really don't look great for a 2023 release.

Sound, Codemasters has always excelled here, and honestly, it seems like they've reused vehicle sounds from DR2 in many cases, but that's not really a bad thing because they're still some of the best in the industry.

The good of this title is that it does build on previous games in the Dirt series and provides some extremely fun rally. I use a DD1 driving this and it feels great, it's the first rally title that i have actually enjoyed racing the tarmac stages and feeling the grip that should be there when every other game, including previous codemaster titles, feels floaty and vague.
There is plenty of room for improvement however, some minor aspects include the car builder and livery editor, these could be rather exciting aspects but at this stage are just empty.

Now, the main issue. Performance.
I was noticing multiple crashes and couldn't play to start with, after a little bit of playing around and forcing the game to start using DirectX 11 i have managed to get it to a stable state with minimum stutters at around 90FPS during the first run on a map and 120FPS on subsequent run. While this is not ideal and is disappointing, it works, and rather well.

Gameplay wise, pretty great, much better than I expected from EA and Codies. But they have learned to master their single player career with the F1 games I think and it shows here, you can create your own team and even your own car and liveries and the added customization is a huge plus for me. You can get into many invitational events with many different types of cars from the baby kind up to Group B and the likes. 

Driving feels great, and the different kinds of surfaces all feel very satisfyingly different, you really have to consider your driving style for each. I play with a controller and feedback is nice, you can easily tell when you're locking up and losing the tyres. If you're experienced in driving games you can know beforehand what's gonna happen to you (especially if you try to brake the latest in Spain's mountainous roads and crash into rocks)

AI feels nice, tho I had to up difficulty up to 90, still in JRC career mode. Opponents can make mistakes or have trouble considering how their times can fluctuate between stages and some don't even finish the rally events. With hardcore damage on it's not unfairly punishing but you do have to take care not to wreck your car especially when playing the long stages because a full event so far can take up to an hour with realistic/long stages and duration.

The only major downside is the co-driver not being helpful much.

Yeah, thanks chief, eat shit. But that was the case with Dirt 2.0, so, sadly, no changes on that front.

Other than that - car handling is great, major improvement from previous Codemasters rally games. Graphics are great, especially evenings at Estonia track, looks almost photo-realistic. Sounds are chef's kiss, i can feel all the gravel sandblasting my car's bottom. Vehicle selection is good enough, although i'd love to see more of old shit-boxes to entertain my inner Suomi person to the fullest.

- career mode: alot of fun an chooses to make! Done well if you ask me. Accept for 1 big problem. The AI balancing
- wheel support and FFB: Only Fanatec, Thrustmaster and Logitech work out of the box. This need some fixing as well. Also ffb need some patches to be better. But its not bad for the start of a new game.

Looks much much better than Dirt 2, and I have found that it even runs slightly better, although it can be choppy times; notably when running through foliage.

This game took what Dirt 2 had, and made it better (Except for the UI. that could use a little work).

I'll compare WRC to Dirt 2 to give some reference.

Pros
-almost double the amount of maps Dirt 2 has (no dlc)
-better graphics, at reasonable performance (at least on my system)
-the handling of cars is more immersive (with ffb wheal)
-less arcady compared to D2 
-new snow surface
-new training campaign thing
-realistic campaign
-WAY more cars than D2 (no dlc) + great car customization

Cons
-UI takes way to long to navigate, and is in general, a step back from D2
-like D2, game feels very arcady from 3rd person.
-occasional performance dips
-livery editor is missing key features like copy, paste, undo, redo, flip, mirror.
-some car assets reused from older titles 
-voice lines are a little cliche, and co-driver feels very detached from your current situation.
- co-driver calls are very late, which leaves less room to move them forward.

bad parts i for me are:
-the Italian navigator sound bored and just reading something (ignoring jump or how fast i'm going), a big step back from DIRT and DIRT 2.0;
-the shift, instead of being ""blocked"" from the car you drive (like DIRT and DIRT 2.0 - you drive a group a? so it's H shifter w clutch, you drive a R5? so it's sequential), is ""blocked"" by the setting in the menu, just why? - and no, i'm complaing about that, if you put an option to choose, why not put a ""like the car"" so i don't need to remember each time what to select;
-the limitation of the garage (why an event to improve it? why not make me able to buy it?) and engineering (yea, it's a good ""minigame"", but for me that i want to drive and have fun it's just bothering;
-the custom livery - THE BIGGEST PROBLEM - why i need to put to each side a layer instead to have copy or specular? for the love of god, it's the ABC of custom livery, how you can forget about that?! 
-why cut the animation of the start where you see the car in front start/the car behind waiting? being alone in every stage feels kinda lonly, like, i'm alone in the entire game..

 the goods parts for me are:
-i love the career pacing, finally you drive different cars, so you don't have to go on a quick race just to change (even if i repet 2 times the same rally with different cars;

what can i add? it's DIRT 3.0 basically, every thing else is better then the previous one :)

Don't believe all the whiners, but if you have an old video card and cpu, wait till the update to see how it pans out, or upgrade when you can. I see a lot of people in the forums asking for help with graphics cards that are below the minimum requirements, that won't work with this game like it did with the older Dirt games, this one needs more VRam.

I am on an I7 11th gen and RTX 3080 and it runs nearly perfectly, I've capped it at 90fps, which is plenty for me, and it doesn't go below that. I am not running full ultra settings, no reason for me to but a mix of ultra/high/medium, ultra for textures and important things, less for stuff that I hardly see. There are some small issues with performance that I would prefer not to have, but it hasn't affected my play at all, and they are working on an early patch for optimization. Stuttering from shader caching hasn't happened for me since the first day, it stops stuttering from this when you drive more stages. There are minor stutters that are not shader related, I suspect texture streaming, but these don't happen for me on every stage, and usually only 1 or 2 times in a stage if they do. I have not crashed as a result of a stutter. Neither has the game in fact, 37 hours and no crashes.

EA launcher doesn't start when you play the game if that matters to you.

Feels good to drive and the community is strong. I've been playing racing games for too long now, well before FFB and this holds up in my eyes. Graphics are better than DR2 (I think some DR2 stages were a little cartoony), but these games aren't for pixel snipers, so don't expect an over saturated super shiny DoF mess you can claim as a life experience, it's a racing game, and it looks good.

Worth a buy at this price IMHO. Plenty of games for $80 launch with significant problems and many crashes, though the gaming industry in general needs to stop releasing games with major issues at all.

Dirt Rally 2.0 was awesome with this, since you could play the game without any issues and iterruptions from EA. Now you can't even get to the main menu, join a club, look at leaderboards or get the DLC pre-order content that you paid for because your account got deactivated. 

""Just link your account to other EA account duh"" yea sure buddy, EA thought of that. Not to mention the false advertisiment from EA, apparently ""true triple screen support"" or ""huge list of supported wheels and devices"". Hell the game doesn't even register a handbrake, not to mention all the wheelbases and non working force feedback. I hate to compare every rally game to Richard Burns, but holy hell its getting really embarrassing. I wont even mention the bugs that some 4WD cars act like 2WD, if your game installs somehow ""wrong"" and the shitty physics of the car losing grip. There's no continuity, it's just ""hey you have grip and now you just dont"" and if you try to correct you get snap oversteer. ""skill issue"" my ass. The arcade physics aren't even my problem, i often come back to rally games like CMR2 from 2000's and enjoy it's overly top arcade physics, Rally Rush 3 is also an awesome arcade game. But my main issue with this title is how nothing work because EA is involved. Truly the worst company out there, from the games they ruin, to their customer support and overall the worst experience you can get with a company that ""cares about games and their customers"".

Have fun playing anything from EA if you - get banned in other EA title / get your account stolen / get your account diactivated for no reason (and EA support just keeps saying the same AI automated responses and if you try to explain anything they'll just tell you to fuck off and that they ""won't respond"" to your emails anymore).
There are literally people who's accounts worth hundreds get banned because they were killing enemies that were AFK in deatmatch mode in Apex Legends.

Graphics are an improvement, but not by as much as you would think. The new engine allows them to make stages much longer distances than before.

Unfortunately as many have said and the developer itself has acknowledge it, there are some technical issues on PC version, which doesn't affect console versions. 
Another gripe from me is that as Codemaster now is able to create longer stages due to the abandonment of the old Ego engine, gone also most of the short (max 4km) or medium (4-8km) stages. In fact I think the shortest stages are in the range of 6-7km. This might be contrary to what most of the sim racing / rally community has asked for years, but as we get older and have accummulate more responsibilities, we don't always have the time or energy to do a 10-15 minutes or longer stage every time we want to enjoy some rallying.
So I think it's important to keep some short or medium stages in the game. I don't think it will detriment to the enjoyment of the game by all but very few people.

So far I am extremely satisfied with that decision, the game is just fun, feels good, not TOO sim, but enough that you can dial stuff in and see the differences. Gravel remains king, but I also have really enjoyed the snow. Tarmac feels the worst of the 3 honestly.

Graphically it's good, not great. visuals are clean enough to read the road ahead of time with no issues, everything looks sharp and I am getting 90+ FPS on all high settings on my Ryzen 9 / RTX-2070 Super combo @ 1080p.

Sound is good enough, not amazing, get's the job done and is not annoying to listen to.

The car builder is pretty bare bones but cool none-the-less. Livery editor is typical racing game fare, the same as Forza and the other racing games albeit slightly more limited in scope, WRC lacks ""Copy to other Side"" options and has no scaling percentages/sizes anywhere on screen so making things match is all up to eyeballing it and guess work.

I have been playing with a Series X controller because I am too lazy to drag my wheel and stand out of the garage and it plays well on controller out of the box.

Overall for a NEW rally game and for only $45 it's a solid recommend if you enjoy the thrill of racing or especially rallying.",1699235134,1699235134,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Realistic and difficult are not always the same thing, modern day rally cars handle extremely well. If anything DR2 was often unrealistic in how difficult some cars were to handle, tarmac and RWD especially. 

As for the performance, it's not perfect but it's nowhere near unplayable either, at least on a half decent pc. I have a 3060 and AMD 3600x CPU and am able to play at 100fps consistently without issue. Only thing I had to do was turn all the shader related settings to low, but the other settings could stay at high/medium no problem. This should be a relatively easy fix for the devs too as it's just shader related.

As for the game itself, in my opinion it's the best rally game ever made. I don't understand the mixed review score at all. More content (especially steges) than any other rally game by far, the physics feel amazing (both in terms of realism and fun), I've had no issues with playing both on wheel and controller. Stages are by far the best I've ever seen, with an insane amount of content in that regard. Graphics are really nice (for the genre at least), and as usual codemasters have delivered top tier sound design.

The good:
I am having a great time playing this rally simcade (finally after 20+ years my dreams came true as this is a true succesor of CMR 2.0 - many hardcore wheelers will not like it, I myself am an unapologetic dirty gamepad casual).
Tracks are varied, cars are plenty, stage lenght and difficulty can be adjusted to everyone's liking (unlike Dirt 2.0).
Career mode and the ability to assemble your own car appear to be fun so far.

The bad:
Considering all above, I would not recommend buying the game on Steam until some genuine performance fixes are done. 
Playing on RTX 3060ti at 1080p, I still have the UNREAL Engine stutter issues (there is already plenty material on that across several forums) and thermals are pretty high considering the underwhelming graphic presentation.
I force capped the FPS to around 65-72 FPS as I cannot see much difference between that and 75 to 90 FPS when not capped. The stutter dips are not so dramatic and the thermals are down by 10 degrees at times. So yup, I do that in order for the fans making much less noise, reducing it by a couple of FPS, the effect of which I personally cannot see.

The ugly:
Really, the menu makes the PC run hotter than the actual racing? Cmon EA, I had enough of the exact same BS in FIFA 23.
As of now, enabling DLSS IMHO makes the game look ugly, making it worst during night stages, as the line between car lighted area and unlighted parts of the track looks awful (there is a weird grain effect - not as bad during day stages).

Pros:
-The Sound
-The Visuals
-FFB on Logitech G29 is fantastic
-Plenty of cars to choose from.

Cons:
-Some frame stutters even with a reasonably high end PC well beyond recommended specs
-Tarmac physics are better but still don't feel like I would expect
-Career mode takes its sweet time to allow you to drive the car you built, coaxing you into doing invitational events first. (This may not be a con for everyone as it does allow you to get a feel for the game in a slower car first)
-No VR (yet) - Is planned post launch


Overall, I'm super excited to play this game more and more. With EA behind it, I was worried, but to their credit, the things hidden behind DLC/Paywall/EA Pass is nothing worth fretting over. So far, I've only noticed cosmetics and a couple of ""moments"" scenarios behind paywalls. If you were a fan of Dirt Rally 2.0 but really wanted WRC content, then this is the game for you. I highly recommend using headphones if you can as the sound design is so immersive. Little things like the car sounding louder when a door falls off is a great touch. The body panels of the car bouncing around like you would expect on a bumpy road just add to the immersion. The ability to create or join clubs for community focused multiplayer championships is a welcome sight and seems to work very well.",1699202807,1699202807,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Performance is okay some stutters in my first 2 hours but they have all but dissipated. My fps ranges from 60-90 with mostly high settings and dlss quality, where in dirt rally 2.0 i had similar fps with a mix of high ultra settings. The only real exception for this is the dense stages in mexico i have drops down to 50.
the car selection is great and everything i have driven feels unique in its own way some feel more detailed than others.
FFB is also really well done and i have no real complaints 
the stages are definitely the star of the show comfortably the best stages i have experienced out of any of the rally games including RBR RSF. 
asphalt and road surfaces still aren't great but better than dirt 2.0
no UDP support so no motion and simhub support. unless you are using D-box motion. but i have read that is game soon

Believe who you want, 99% of us have never driven one of these cars before and never will. In the end the driving feels great and there is definitely a high skill ceiling, so just enjoy.

As for the performance issues, that will depend from system to system. For me it has been running smoothly, with maybe 2 stutters so far at 2K resolution, 144hz and high/ultra settings on my RTX3070. The devs are already working on further optimization though, so should be fine in the near future.

As for the game itself, it's basically DR3 with a WRC license. A lot more content than DR2 and the career is more fleshed out as well. Sadly no VR support yet, so have to see how that pans out.

I haven't tested it on a steering wheel, but as for the physics, I still don't have a concrete opinion, I often have the impression that the car has too much grip, often I can't skid around a corner, the car stops. 

Some of the stages aren't realistic, Rally Portugal doesn't have the routes identical to reality as in the WRC generations, the stage names are all wrong. 

Another aspect that really annoys me is the fact that EA adds content and you only get it if you pay for a subscription, even if you have all the season passes.

The handling is more like DR2 which is a good thing because I never could enjoy playing previous WRC games - there was always something very ""off"" playing them for me. I tried this game with Fanatec CSL DD and found no big issues with setting it up in game. It does feel a bit more ""arcadey"" but it's still 90% similar to DR2. Every game is different in terms of handling and will have it's pros and cons around how a car ""should"" handle on different roads like gravel, tarmac etc - and most of us haven't really done rally racing in real life so most of us just like to imagine ""how it should be"". As was mentioned by others tarmac has too much grip and even using the e-brake will sometimes not give the expected result.

Force feedback - In my opinion force feedback has been improved and you can better feel the engine and road texture. The wheel feels a bit more responsive and less ""twitchy"". I can have a better feel of where the wheel will return to axis and overall I think it's better than DR2 and WRC games.

Sound is also improved but not by very much and I would say there's really no place for improvement. In my opinion no other auto sim can rival RaceRoom in terms of car engine sound.

Graphics - not really as impressive at it was marketed and I can't really say wow it has amazing visuals. It looks like slightly better version of DR2. There is no raytracing and no VR.

Performance - with a 7900xt I had to lower settings from Ultra to High and also lower the resolution from the Samsung Neo G9 native one because I was getting around 50-60 fps and stutters when everything was maxed out. FSR upscaling doesn't really help (maybe 5-10fps). I am expecting both EA and AMD to improve performance for the game. 

Game content is also good. Lots of races and cars. In my opinion RWD cars are still unusable like in all previous rally games but then again I'm no rally racer or pro auto sim gamer. 

I'm waiting for the telemetry fix so I can enjoy bass shaker rumble through SimHub. 

I can understand the overall disappointment with the game but still it's a solid rally game in my opinion - I don't think it will manage to dethrone DR2 but it's a solid 2nd place in rally games category. 

I also hope that in the future reviewers will mention how they tried the game - I always have to filter for reviews of people who used racing wheels. Maybe Steam can come in the future with a dropdown when reviewing and the user can select the relevant controller.

Because you really have the feeling you're there, you start somewhere in an open field with straight big roads and suddently the landscape changes so do the roads, they become tight with very sharp turns and after that you find yourself on the top of a mountain and then you have to descend it,you somehow end up in a Quarry or a village with amazing scenery. I didn't really have this feeling with Dirt Rally, it's a good sim don't get me wrong but the stages were too tough in my opinion which makes it harder for some people with different skill level to compete, finishing a stage was the biggest challenge whether this game is a little bit more forgivable which just increases the fun and the play-ability. However it's sad we still can't drive with multiple cars physically on the stage, i really loved this multiplayer mode in the old Dirt games. If you're a wheel player, you have to tweak your force feedback a bit to get a better feeling on tarmac, the tarmac physics by codemasters have always been a thing and they will never get it accurate i think, but i didn't buy the game to drive on tarmac, i have other games/sims for that. But you can get a much better feeling in the wheel if you lower the Tyre friction to around 25%, this will give you much more information in my opinion. This was also a common tweak back in Dirt Rally. 

However there are some issues to be resolved, i hope they will manage to fix it. What i'm talking about here are random freezes, mostly happening in Multiplayer lobbies where there are quite a lot of people, i'd say limit the lobbies to 10-12 people and problem solved for the time being. In career mode as any other singleplayer mode i'm not experiencing freezes anymore, some minor fps drops at places with lots of scenery but that's nothing unusual. 

I'd say if you're a real rally enthousiast, buy it. If you're someone that hates experiencing bugs, please wait a few months for all the bugs to be fixed and then buy it. If you're a hardcore sim guy and you want the ultra realistic driving experience where you crash basicly every given corner, please... f... o.. and stay away from this game. People have gone crazy about this game, positively and negatively but in my opinion it's worth your money, the amount of content you get for the price is good and playing this with your friends or even alone is an awesome experience, when you've done a 25km stage without crashing it feels really rewarding. Don't buy the Season pass though, it's just a ripoff now, this was a free thing for early access buyers, it gives you some helmets, suits, gloves...

Pros :
- Pretty much the same game as Dirt Rally 2.0 in term of gameplay, so it's as fun and a good middleground between simcade and hardcore simulation
- Stages are longer which make them more stressfull
- Career mode is alright, takes a lot of inspiration from the myteam mode in the F1 game (as well as a lot of assets for the customisations)
- Having the official WRC license and the modern WRC cars is cool, they are group B cars but on drugs kinda

Cons :
- Visually the game is decent, but I find the stages to be less detailled than DR2.0
- The co-pilot is a robot, DR2.0 felt so natural
- Some options are missing, i'm thinking of the transmission setting where you can only choose sequential or H pattern, while in DR2.0 you could choose both and it would adapt based on the car you would drive
- Rallycross is missing, while I know it's a WRC game and Rallycross wasnt my favorite gamemode in DR2.0, it was a nice changing from time to time to go for a Rallycross event
- The soundtrack is garbage
- Shitty ass EA monetization put into the game

Overall it's a good game, but DR2.0 is better IMHO
Get this game if you really want the official WRC licence, but if you only want a good rally game that's realistic but not richard burn's rally, go for Dirt Rally 2.0 instead",1699187623,1699187700,False,5,0,0.499623984098434448,0,True,False,False

LOTS of Stages, some of them really long and the ones I've played so far seemed really fun and challenging
The car handling feels great both on gravel as well as on asphalt, although i can't really notice a big difference to DR2.0. But i haven't played nearly enough to properly rate the handling aspect.
The Cars look great and there are many to choose from

Now the cons:
I'm definitely not the first to say this but i think the graphics are abysmal for a game from 2023. Way worse than DR2.0 and it honestly looks like a game from 2013. 
I'm playing on 2k resolution, maxed out graphics settings and everything on Ultra and the terrain and landscape is just straight up disapointing. 
And even with these disgusting graphics from 10 years ago the game stutters or has lagspikes sometimes.
My GPU is a RTX 4070 and CPU Ryzen 7 7800X3D 
The NPCs really are NPCs as you'd expect them in a 10 yr old game. Waving and Cheering in totally different directions instead of towards you when you're flying by, their shoes clipping into the terrain and deas expressionless faces (Which is not that big of a deal for me in a rally game but it takes away from the immersion).
And dont even let me get started on the rear view mirror it looks like from assetto corsa with no mods and lowest graphic settings.

The Graphics are such a bummer I'm actually thinking of refunding the game and just sticking with DR2.0

So in conclusion, at least right now i cant recommend this game at all sadly. Lets hope they fix it in the future bc the amount of content and the car handling surely make for a good rally sim

But then slowly all the negative aspects came to light. The first negative thing I noticed was the terrible performance. The game actually looks and runs worse compared to Dirt Rally 2.0. Personally, I wouldn't have a problem with the graphics, but the fact that it also runs worse is just embarrassing.
Then the menu navigation, which is incredibly terrible. I don't understand why you always have to hide everything behind some tablet looking buttons and constantly have to go back and forth in menus. No matter whether it's in the main menu or between stages, the menus just suck. And stuff like the livery editor that just doesn't work properly and it is missing essential features like copy & paste, mirror to other side etc. So in carrer mode I was just driving a grey box the entire time.
And then the gameplay itself. Like I said earlier, handling and the tracks themselves are great and I had fun driving through the stages.
Then I noticed that the AI was 1-2 minutes, yes MINUTES, behind me in one single stage despite the difficulty setting being set to maximum. I was very confused about it and at first thought it was maybe a bug or something. Then I tested several vehicle classes and AI settings in a self created rally. The result was that the difficulty slider had absolutely no effect on the AI's times. Like they always drove about the same time regardless of the AI setting, maybe like 1 or 2 seconds faster/slower.

- It has random frame drops and stutters.
- Rally stages can just stop working and your car is literally falling through the damn road (SWeMX is my youtube channel and you'll see my latest video playing this game).
- Livery editor doesn't work because you can only at the moment change paint of the whole car or the wheels, Not different parts of the car. And the decals/logos doesn't show up at all or they are stretched beyond f***ing recognition. I have no idea why they haven't fix this yet.

Basically Dirt Rally 3 in everything but name, visuals are a bit how ya going but can look pretty nice in certain conditions. Performance is fairly consistent with a few rough spots, I managed to get it running pretty decently on my 1060 on medium/low settings with amd upscaler set to quality. 

Handling is pretty familiar to Dirt Rally 2 with some improvements to tarmac handling. Playing on a gamepad it feels really satisfying attacking corners, and the new hybrid wrc cars are really intense to drive, only rivalled by the group b cars.

The stages are a step up in quality overall from dirt rally 1 / 2, and there are a surprising amount of locations.

The career is pretty nice, letting you build your own car (or just get an existing wrc car) and go through different events on a weekly schedule. Revolves around having to race for a benefactor that gives you a budget to manage different aspects, with goals that can improve relations and increase the budget. Actually makes for a nice change since it lets you just grab any additional cars as long as it's within the budget and garage space. No penalty for removing cars from your garage too, just swap it out with a different one.

As of now the game is a bit rough around the edges, nowhere near broken but definite graphical bugs and a weird bug with the livery editor tanking the frame rate. There is a bit of that classic unreal engine shader stutter but the devs have addressed that they are working on it and additional performance issues, so I expect most of them to be fixed pretty quickly.

The other issue I have is as a new player to driving sims and especially Rally, the Training system they have in game is pathetic. None of it actually explains any rally concepts or walks you through things. It just throws you onto a map and says to complete it within a set time. Then you just have to figure it out yourself. Those two areas for me don't make this game friendly to newer players to this type of driving sim. TrackIR needs to be support immediately at minimum and revamp that Rally training so it actually teaches new drives rally driving concepts step by step.

Is the game perfect? No, however they did an incredible job to get the game out as fast as I did only getting the license from the FIA and WRC only in Februrary this year, the fact they have made this game in 9 months is a testament to their skill and next years game will be even better.
The car models are fantastic.
The handling is fantastic.
I run the game on Ultra for every setting running 32gb ram and a 4070, it runs great!
The fact they manage to even get Molly Petitt to find to do some of the voice overs is incredible.
The car customisation is probably the best it has ever been in any of the Codemaster games! The fact you can place decals wherever you want, reshape, resize and recolour as you wish and with the season pass can unlock paint job patterns which again you can fully customise is fantastic.
The character customisation on the other hand, is lacking, but seeing as you dont really see them all that much, is it really a big deal? I am sure in future patches thesee would be remedied or in the next game. (though it is pretty awesome to be able to name your co-driver!)
The game appears to have been made in UE4 judging by the lighting's bluish tinge. (having used said engine a lot im familiar with its quirks).
But the most important thing is EVERY MAP IS HAND CRAFTED. I raced on one of the stages which is set just up the road from where I live and I recognised every twist and turn, the terrain features from trees and berms even houses arent copy and paste, they are relevant to what you see on that track, every tiny detail, as if you were there in the flesh down to the smallest features such as the forest green rural school bus stops in some areas of the oceania circuit. By the end of that track I was buzzing, I felt I had just rallied just up the road from my home village.

EDIT:
I also see a lot of negative reviews around the cars having a ""central pivot point"" and that its not ""realistic"". This is realistic. The manufacturers, drivers, teams etc, take great pains in centralising the centre of gravity in their vehicles so that they can turn as if the car has a ""central pivot point"". So to see that Codemasters has taken the time to listen to the drivers and other industry experts in regards to rallying is also A+ to me, and would be common knowledge to fans who watch everything in the WRC.

END OF EDIT

Should you expect to see the level of quality thats typical of a codemasters game? No, however with the industry being under scrutiny by empathetic gamers and even governments around the globe about the severe crunch times that was typical in the industry for the longest time, the fact we even got a game at all is astounding!
Give codemasters a break and appreciate the game for what it is! If you cant appreciate it, I strongly suggest you go and make a game like you want in 9 months and see how you go!

driving feel, car models, sounds and stages are better than dr2. stages in particular are much longer and detailed

force feedback feels good but very dampened at times, specialy in tarmac

despite what some people say, graphics are really good and feel a step up from dr2

---- what i didnt like so much ----

i personaly prefered DR2 UI... its not bad but it feels off a little

voice acting is not very engaging, many times your manager/engineer/molly will just repeat the same lines... this addition made little sense to me as it doesnt help with immersion

co-driver just feels dead inside, mechanicaly spiting course notes with zero flavor or interection with the driver's actions or the car's condition

stutters are a problem yes, but its not very frequent i would say... been playing with a 2060 super and it keeps 60-70 fps at 1440p with DLSS enabled

Later However, those who got to play an early version of the game seemed to enjoy it a lot, so I decided to give it a shot when the game came out. Coming from Richard Burns Rally (RBR) I must say, I think codies absolutely hit the mark with this one, so here's my 2 cents.

[h2]Graphics[/h2]
The game definitely looks very good. the stages and weather look quite realistic, although a bit blown out and overly bright at times. It's nice to see how much more there is going on in a stage (fans and marshalls standing by, birds flying up, planes flying over) and is a huge improvement over Dirt: Rally 2.0 (DR2.0) where, in my opinion, the stages always looked and felt quite boring. The way the car gets nasty over time and depending on the surface type is also very nice to see.

[h2]Performance[/h2]
although the game isn't particularly demanding, it still stutters in certain parts of some stages on any system. Codies is, as of the time of writing, working on a fix though. Apart from these stutters I haven't run into any performance issues with the game.

[h2]Physics[/h2]
The physics are decent. The cars generally behave as you'd expect depending on the surface type, tyres, drive type and engine placement. especially the tarmac physics is a huge upgrade form DR2.0 as the car really bites into the asphalt a lot more. The ""pivot point"" physics are still present and noticable though. I've had multiple instances where the rear steps out without sliding and clipping a wall or tree in the process. It's really annoying and can actually ruin a rally if you're unlucky enough.

[h2]Damage model[/h2]
The damage model is actually really in-depth. Sure, it's quite forgiving: Hitting a tree head on will damage the car and slow you down a lot, but it won't be an instant dnf like for example RBR and IRL. I can definitely see why they made the damage model the way it is though and I don't see it as a bad thing at all, though it is something to note. You also have a great level of control over what you repair and what you will save time on in the service area, which is a very good thing.

[h2]User experience[/h2]
I only have good things to say here really. The games is easy to set up (it detected my Fanatec CSL DD instantly and had all the buttons mapped in a way that makes sense automatically), the UI is intuitive, I'm enjoying the career mode a lot, and there is multiplayer present, so hopefully joining a league and doing an online championship in this game will be possible too (haven't tried it yet, but it's my favourite thing to do in RBR).

[h2]Content[/h2]
Although sometimes a bit overlooked in simracing games, the amount of locations, stages and cars available matters a great deal for the ammount of time you'll spend in a game. Luckily enough the game is far from lacking in this front. There is a good mix of historic and modern cars available, from the classics from the 50s , 60s, and 70s, to the lethal beasts of the group B era, to the beautiful cuties from the 90s and early 2000s to the modern WRC machines, where you can also choose to work your way through the ranks or jump straight into the top category. There is also a wide selection of stages available across all locations of the 2023 WRC season. I do however hope codies doesn't stop here and keeps adding tracks, cars and other improvements to the game.

Being negative and upset because this is not your precious Richard Burns Rally only works to undermine possible new games going forward.

At the current moment, I would not recommend the game to any one that loves sim racing. Maybe Codemasters can make wonder and refine the game to a more desirable state.

They fixed the asphalt grip from DR 2.0, the cars are much more planted and behave a lot more like a real vehicle, the FFB seems to have been tuned a lot better with understeer forces in particular feeling a lot better, the graphics are great (I'm running the game at high settings with a few key things either turned off or down to medium), and the amount of content available at launch is outstanding. It really does seem like Codies listened to the community and took the best parts of DR 2.0, mixed them with the best parts of the old WRC series, and worked to fix the known issues from DR 2.0. 

I dare say, this is THE rally title for the masses. It isn't full sim, but at this point I don't think we've really nailed down *exactly* how every car should feel and drive, but it is a far step up from both the existing WRC titles and the DiRT Rally series, and if you're a fan of the genre you should definitely give it a go.

Side note on the decision to use the Unreal Engine, because there are a good few reviews complaining about that decision ... those reviewers are delusional. Yes, the old UE engine was terrible for racing sims/games, for physics and FFB, but the recent revisions have made it more than an acceptable choice.

The main reason is interested in rally, rallyx, dirt 1, dirt 2 player and sim racing as whole.
And also I really wanted to check if is our game industry is full of BS at level like 99%? I've watched tons of youtube reviews about how cool this game is 
and how this will be next dr 2.0 or as someone say dr 3.0.

Anyway, let's get back to the review.

At this stage its unplayable. That is it.
Im getting ~60fps@4k RTX4090 with drops to 20fps and freezes for like 0.1-1 of second. 
Yeah its ultra and in dr2.0 im getting 150-170fps with drops to 140fps with ultra as well.
GPU utilization in the race is around 50%, but in the menu, it's around 90%, and that's where I'm getting my ~140fps. LOL

Note: I'm talking about ""quick race"" mode over there^ for some reason rally school and carrier recces does not suffer for fps issue its much stable, and I was able to get 120-140fps. Seems like its per stage performance issue 

===Graphics===
It's set to ultra by name but looks much worse than DR 2.0. It does not look like next-gen. The cars and levels appear washed out and pixelated.

===Physics===
I don't know, it feels like driving a brick on some curvy roads.

===Sounds===
The music is meh; I turned that off right away. The car sounds are okay, nothing that's noticeably bad or good. But for some reason, DR 2.0 still has a more raw car-like sound, which I prefer. It's nice to have different voices for the co-driver, though (yay, first plus).

===Conclusion===
So... yeah game industry and all those paid promotion sim racers youtube reviewers are BS. 
I love Steam/Valve for they return policy. Cheers!
Lets go RBR!

There's a lot of dialog on the internet that ""this isn't a simulator"" or ""WRC is an arcade racer"". I don't think that's really fair or accurate. Comparing the handling here to arcade racing does it a huge disservice, and anyone who attempts to play this like Need For Speed will quickly find themselves wrapped around a tree, or trying to drive on flat tires. I'm no rally racer IRL, but this does give me an immersive feel of high-speed, off-road driving. The end result is handling that still very much rewards precision and skill, which in the end makes it exactly what I wanted.

Plenty of IRL rally racers that have created some content around it, so if you want a training-level sim before you get in a real rally car, consult them first. If you want a really fun rally game that isn't just the weird insanity that Forza Horizon and Dirt 4 have, or the destruction oriented racing of Wreckfest...WRC is the absolute best entry since Rally 2.0...and honestly I find it a much more complete package than what 2.0 offered. In this instance the EA funding and support has really allowed Codemasters to thrive.

Really I only am left wishing VR support was here at launch, but plenty of fun without also. I'd also like the livery editor to have more ""brands"", or a better way to import them similar to what GT7 offers.

Worth noting that while the game includes the first few seasons of cosmetic passes, there are tiers that have bonus items for EA Play subscribers. Minor loss if you don't want to use EA Play though, still plenty of content to earn and use.

First, the bad: clearly has some optimisation issues - to get it to run smooth on my 7800XT at 1440p I had to drop to mid/high settings. First game I've had to do that so far, pretty much everything else runs on ultra - but at least they're apparently working on it. The car livery designer leaves a lot to be desired too - no option to mirror decals on the left & right sides of the car. I'd also like the ability to import logos, if we're going to run our own rally team in career I want the ability to run my IRL livery in game!

Onto the good - physics. MASSIVE improvement over DR2.0 - they've fixed the car rotation problem that left the cars feeling floaty. Here, they feel like they have real weight and grip. The car behaviour when airborne is a real highlight - flying over crests and feeling the car go light at the top of 5th or 6th gear in Finland now feels *right*, it flows so well. My only complaint is they've implemented the typical video game thing of making the car roll back to its wheels if you roll it onto its side.
I've gotta put it out there... I've seen a lot of comments that the cars are 'glued to the ground' or that 'Scandinavian flicks aren't possible'. I'm guessing these people have never driven a real race/rally car before. I have, and do so regularly. This is what proper rally cars feel like - glued down unless you're actually having a go. If the cars here feel like they have too much grip to you, I'm going to put it very simply: you are not driving fast enough. Git gud.

The stages are absolutely fantastic too - we finally have some actually authentic stages in a game that isn't Richard Burns Rally. Many are proper single-lane width, realistic length (20-30km) and are actually challenging, unlike previous games with superhighway width stages (I'm looking at you, Finland in DR.2.0). The new Croatian and Japanese stages are incredible, there's nothing more fun than blasting up Vrbno in an F2 306. Love the ability to run different seasons too, rather than being stuck with say snow in the same spots on Monte stages.

Honestly this is the game I've been waiting for to replace Richard Burns Rally. Just needs that shader stuttering sorted and some optimisation - and some more cars. Add the Skoda Octavia WRC, Hyundai Accent WRC, Nissan Almera F2, some more Group B cars (e.g. Citroen BX 4TC, 240RS, RX7, Celica, Skodas and Ladas), some RWD Datsuns (510 Bluebird, A10 Violet/Stanza) and maybe some 90's WRC Toyotas and it'll actually be perfect then!",1699111970,1699111970,True,3,0,0.521028876304626465,0,True,False,False

Despite being the most eagerly anticipated of all rally games (ever) if feels like a beta that's so far off being ready for general release.. Utter garbage! Can't make out if its the version you download from Steam or if its a general issue. I will be demanding a refund and won't be revisiting this game for some time to come, despite being a huge fan of rally racing. Never in the history of rally gaming (and I go back as far as Sega Rally) have I seen a game so far off the mark.

Firstly, the game doesn't look at your system and set graphics to an optimum level. I had to go into the game settings to set the resolution of my screen then adjust graphics to high from a paltry low setting. This tidied things up a bit. The home screen I am greeted with a man standing in front of a hybrid rally car. The pic looks awful, which  for a moment led me believe that my graphics setting needed adjusting. After adjustment, as already mentioned, the pic still looks garbage. The mans face even has big black marks (pixelated looking marks) all over it and the suit and car look kind of blurry and very un-detailed.

Feeling somewhat underwhelmed and thinking some kind of future update would probably fix this I went on to have a quick go at Time-Trial mode. When I picked the category and car I wanted to use the image was initially shocking. The car was almost completely black, looking like a silhouette against the backdrop of the garage workshop it was sat in. Clicked race and went into the game. For moment all looked okay. I like to race in 3rd person viewing the car from behind. This looked kind of okay but not a glossy looking production. 5-4-3-2-1 and off we go..! Gameplay was as bad as the game looks I'm afraid to say. Game is juttery and jumpy. Thought I had issues with my refresh rate, but alas it appears its another game issue. I genuinely thought I had problems with my computer so loaded WRC Generations and MotoGP 23 to find all is working okay (Phew!).. During gameplay I noted the cars have absolutely no suspension to speak of. Under cornering or braking the cars do not role or yaw. The cars appear to pivot around a central axis to accommodate the given terrain. Haven't seen that behaviour in a rally game for a very, very long time! One plus point; the cars engines sound amazing. The scenery and tracks look kind off okay in terms of content, albeit a bit boring.. The scenery itself will pop up to greet you when you get there and you will notice when this happens, as alas its always happening! Flicked between 3rd person (behind car view) to cockpit view and wow - the dash is completely black. A lot like the silhouette effect of the car I saw in the showroom / garage. Had similar issues when watching the stage back on replay mode.

Went in to try and customise the look of a Ford Fiesta WRC. Thought the interface and controls to do so were naff and stupidly slow! 

I'm sorry guys, but I could put exclamation marks all over this review. This feels like the publisher (EA Sports) has given the production company (Codemasters) a deadline to get this game out on a given date in whatever state its currently in. Surprising given that I believe EA Sports has bought Codemasters, and both should be absolutely ashamed of themselves as this game (as it currently stands) is an abomination. Out of all the games I have ever purchased from steam, over many years, this is by far the worst and feels months if not years away from being a finished product as it has technical issues and bugs galore.

During the 4-day experience, I have seen multiple times of game crushing for no reason,sudden low frame rate for unknown reason,while my GPU shows only about 40% of it was used for this game.

As for multiplayer mode, I was excited before about a better server than DR2, but everything in this game tells me that I was wrong.I was kicked out of the lobbies for several times because of the ""connection problem"" .The ""Voice Chat Auto Ducking"" option was totally more than useless,because we do not want our co-driver to reduce his volume while doing intense driving,also the frame rate gets even lower and more unpredictable when this option is on.

And the most upsetting problem for me is the LANGUAGE BARRIER.

I'm not an ultra sim racer like many people leaving reviews on this game, i'm playing on a standard xbox controller, nothing special. The only other WRC game i've played on PC is WRC 10, which was developed by a KT, so its nice to see a WRC game getting the treatment from a high-end developer at last. 

My PC specs are:
AMD 3800XT
AMD 6750XT Sapphire Pulse OC
32GB RAM @ 3200MHz
Playing on 1080p 60Hz screen

[h2]Things I like:[/h2]

The sound design, cars sound great and each one has it's own unique sound profile unlike other racing games i've played where all engines really just sound the same.

I'll say I like the graphics, but they're not out of this world stunning, But this is my own personal opinion. On balance i'd day I prefer the graphics in WRC 10. (I'll write more about performance below).

I love the choice of cars, i'm a huge fan of classic WRC and all the way back to the Group B days when the only rules were ""Please don't kill any spectators, otherwise how you arrive at the end of the stage is up to you"", so when previous WRC games locked classic cars out behind DLC paywalls, this was disappointing. But not here! I can now finally bomb around Greece in a Lancia like I've always dreamed of! And nobody can stop me!! 

I like how the cars handle for the most part, especially how the differences between 4WD, FWD, and RWD are modelled. You do have to learn how to drive each one differently.

The learning curve is pretty comfortable for my liking. After all, this is game that is marketed towards a wider audience as possible. I'd say WRC 10 had a steeper learning curve, to provide comparison. 

I like the choice of game modes, especially the ""Moments"" mode, which allows you to relive classic moments in WRC history, which is awesome. 

The career mode is good, but I do have some reservations which i'll get to in the next section. 


[h2]Things I don't like (most of which are with career mode, sadly):[/h2]

The menu design. I find it cluttered and difficult to find information I need, especially in career mode. I simply can't find what tournaments my cars are entered into and from what position i'm in from a single place! 

I get that each week you can only choose a single event to do, but why does this include hiring staff, training staff, or expanding my garage slots? These are admin tasks that I should be allowed to do at any time depending on my budget constraints, not force me into doing instead of taking part in a rally. 

Staff Rest events simply don't work. Rest Events don't recover staff stamina quick enough, so you very quickly find yourself in a vicious cycle of not being able to regain stamina but then this also prevents you from taking part in any tournaments or events, thus not earning progress to any team / sponsor goals. This whole concept just needs ripping out from the roots and starting again.

The calendar menu is also ugly and cluttered. I'd rather just a normal calendar like in WRC 10 please, much simpler to read.

The chief engineer / tutorial guy is annoying, and repeats the same Voice Over clips way to often. Molly's voice over does sound a bit false too, like she's reading too heavily from a script. 

The livery editor is pretty embryonic, you can't even copy a decal from one side of the car to the other so both sides are symmetrical, this is pretty basic is any game that has a livery editor. WRC 10 has this, (Hell, even War Thunder has this!)

I'm not a fan of how Asphalt surfaces have been developed, cars seem to either have chronic under-steer, or sudden catastrophic over-steer, neither of which happen on Gravel or Snow.

[h2]In Summary[/h2]
Overall, yes, I do like this game, and I do recommend it. I acknowledge that most of the things I don't like about the game really are just my opinions, and not massive flaws in the game.

Many are bashing the game over it's performance. While yes, when playing the FPS does drop from 60 down to around 45 especially at high speed and in bad weather conditions, this doesn't shock me. Find me a game that doesn't need a level of post-launch optimisation. EA/Codemasters already acknowledged this before and after launch. Personally, I don't think Unreal Engine 5 was the right choice for this game. While it does allow for some great and beautiful looking games to be made, I don't think its suited to something as niche as a Rally game. Improving Codemaster's existing in-house engine would of been a better move, but this isn't going to change so its not worth crying about. Many others are also leaving bad reviews simply because they don't like EA. Well, it was no secret that EA were developing this game, and nobody forced you to buy it. What? You spent £40 of your own money simply to bash EA? Thats a you problem.

I'd also recommend reading the review from Lovely_Uncle if you're a high-end sim fanatic, I wholeheartedly agree with his review and how he's presents his opinions on the game.

If you're like me and just want to pick up a rally game and have a great time, then this is undoubtedly the game for you. Its marketed towards a wider audience as possible, and I've think they've achieved just that. For the price, you are really getting a lot of game, which for EA, really is a pleasant surprise indeed.

Single player is good, but the AI is too easy, playing on anything under 100 is just silly. Career mode is okay, but you cannot join teams, you have to be the ""boss"", even in Rally1.
The car builder looks all cool, but every car made with it performs the same (depending on class)
In terms of official WRC content, there is an annoying amount of missing things. In Rally1, Suninen, Heller, Munster, Latvala and Fourmaux are just missing. There is missing WRC2 drivers as well, most notably THE CHAMPION - Andreas Mikkelsen, I do not understand why he is not in the game.
Livery editor is bad. You cant even share liveries, and all the brands available are made up.
For whatever reason Rally2 and WRC2 are separate classes, despite running the same car regs. 
There is a fair bit of stuttering, some stages are worse than others - for me it wasnt too bad but others seem to have it worse.
Clubs and multiplayer are as you would expect, similar to DR2.0
Long list of issues there, but once you get into a good stage its just FUN. The sounds are excellent, tarmac handling feels better than DR2.0, still not perfect, but on gravel and snow there is more grip, maybe a little too much. I would not say it is super realistic though. It is still believable enough to be immersed with a wheel. Controller is good to play with too, but not very controllable with RWD cars. (The physics are a lot better than WRC Generations)
Car list is mostly good, but there is a real absence of older Nissan/Datsun and Toyota cars.
Long stages are excellent, stage design overall is better too.

The copilot has the most washed out voice I have ever heard. There is so much static I was imagining a 1980's cell phone giving me directions to their house. It is comparable to the dial up modem sound from the 90's.

Let's start with the beginning of the game. I have a thrust master 300 RS GT with a Th8A shifter. The game could not detect the shifter correctly off the bat and I had to calibrate this. Also when using my handbrake it asked me what this unknown device was and I said ""handbrake"" and it did not set it to a handbrake binding. 

After getting into a real race I realized something was very wrong.

I was getting 109 fps at dlss ultra with medium settings and I was losing frames at critical points. When I would turn. When I was braking. When I turned the wheel around a corner. Jarring. No wonder there is no VR support, there is barely any monitor support. This game has such poor performance even on the newest Geforce experience driver, as of 11/4, that I would not consider it a rally game. 

This game does not just have a long way to go it needs an overhaul and a new set of beta testers who have actually played rally games.

Game is not worth $45. I would not play this game even if it was free. This is a bad rally game. I am going back to Dirt Rally 2, because I can at least play Dirt.

Pros:
1. Dirt Rally has better graphics with no doubt. 
2. With my 6700xt I can play Dirt Rally 2.0 with 100fps on max setting, while in WRC I have only 60fps with worse graphics
3. Design of game menu is also better in Dirt Rally 2.0 
4. Penalty system is completely missed 
5. Sounds from cars are better and more realistic in Dirt Rally 2.0 

Cons: 
EA WRC has newest WRC cars, and more classic cars than Dirt Rally 2.0 
EA WRC has almost all popular stages (With no doubt better than Dirt Rally 2.0) 
Better career mode, multiplayer...  
Car physics is OK, definitely better than WRC Generations

In conclusion, I think that EA WRC have potential to be better than Dirt Rally 2.0. But for this, EA have to make graphics better (WRC Generations has too better graphics)

Some Pro's

- There are plenty of stages and plenty of cars to choose from so I don't imagine you'll get bored of this game quickly. 
- Physics feel great on all surfaces.
- The cars sound fantastic, no FH5 repeat sounds in the vehicles I have driven so far.
- The graphics are great, really good level of detail on both the cars and the stages. I am playing on an out of date PC but still running on high graphics settings and getting a constant 50-70fps (1060 GTX 6GB) so yeah not the graphics card recommended for the game.
- Most importantly the stage callouts seem to be perfect, haven't sped into a 5 right only to find it's more of a 3 right causing me to smash into a snow drift. 
- Playing with hardcore damage adds a fun challenge with managing the things to repair in the service areas with the little time you have. Obviously, you can turn this off if you don't want to worry about damaging you're car.
- So far not run into any bugs but then I haven't played the game massively.

Con's

- Doesnt seem to be a realistic gearbox setting, what I mean by that is if you are driving a sequential gearbox car and you have the setting set to H pattern gearbox then you won't be able to use paddles if you have them on your sim wheel. Think Dirt 2.0 had a realistic setting where the gearbox settings on your wheel were automatically set depending on the car you drove. Not a big deal as you can just change the setting (takes around 10 seconds to do).

- The campaign interface is a little confusing at first when choosing events to do but its not a big deal.

- As said above the realistic damage is a fun challenge but I have noticed that for example, if you crack your radiator, the engine temps don't seem to rise on the dash which I did expect. Again a small feature but it would be nice if the developers added this.

Conclusion

I would recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of rallying or just a fan of Motorsport in general. Seen a lot of people saying not to get this as it's an EA game but so far the launch is good! No Battlefield launch, game works perfectly. 

May add more to this review the more I play but so far its a thumbs up from me!

The game is enjoyable, but there are declines in many aspects. Graphics and performance are inferior to DR2, and the sound quality is also lacking. One thing that bothers me the most is the absence of a sound cue when it fails to shift under a manual clutch. In DR2, you can hear it, but not in this game.

In my opinion, the cars in this game provide too much grip compared to DR2, especially on tarmac. This has made it easier to maneuver the cars and has reduced the significance of weight transfer, ultimately making the game easier and requiring much less concentration.

What I appreciate about DR2 is the perpetual sense of being on the edge while driving through stages, which I don't experience in this game. However, if this is not what you are looking for, then EA WRC is a truly enjoyable game with many longer stages, real-life events, licensed events, and cars.

These are my honest opinions and only reflect my personal perspective. I hope they can update VR compatibility soon and resolve the performance issues. However, as a DR2 player, I don't believe it has yet met my standards.",1699073076,1699073076,False,3,1,0.468001425266265869,0,True,False,False

There is a good amount of content and features here for sure and fun to be had, but what I was expecting was just [i]more[/i] Dirt Rally 2.0 with polish. Instead, it's a slightly better version of Kylotonn's work in terms of handling feel and graphics. 2.0 had a clear attention to detail that is missing here.

[h2] Graphics [/h2]
I have a 3080, I'm not going to complain about the performance (yes there are frame drops). My problem here is how awful the lighting is. On ultra, it is horrifically drowned out by god himself shining a spotlight down on the Earth because apparently the Sun couldn't handle it. The texture pop in of the road detail is incredibly distracting. Lastly, I don't know if it was some dynamic resolution, awful AA, or what, but in spite of adjusting settings, there was a constant screen door effect. Unreal Engine has once again claimed another casualty with its productivity.

[h2] Handling [/h2]
It's hard to put a finger on it, but the handling feels like an imitation of 2.0 that tries to appease two crowds and winds up being a letdown (*cough* Dirt 4). I understand that there was a desire to ""open up"" the game to a wider audience. Frankly though, I'd wager nobody gives a crap about rally, let alone a rally game, unless they are a proper fan. What would a proper fan want, shallow arcade feeling or a detailed simulation that has rewarding depth?

[h2] Summary [/h2]
For $50 and the amount of content on offer, I suppose you could justify the purchase. However, this will not scratch the same itch as 2.0. There are more problems then the two I've listed, uninspired audio being another note of mention, but ultimately I don't feel like this was what it needed to be. Codemasters seems primed to drag WRC down the same path that it was on already with Kylotonn and the same path that they have taken F1 down.

Graphics were somehow downgraded, and it looks worse than Dirt Rally 2's graphics, a game that was released almost 5 years ago.
Career mode is a real pain in the ass, I'm not going to elaborate about it.

Many little things in this game feel unrealistic, and it bothers me, for example:

   Finish a track, and there isn't a single bit of dust on your car. You'll finish it like you just 
   finished driving in the city.

   During the track, there is very minimal debris flying out of the rear of your car.

   1st person camera feels very odd because it's fixed to the car's movements and not the   
   driver's. For example if your car flies over a bump and lands hard, you'll feel FIXED to your   
   car, without any realistic camera shake.



Only good things that this game has are better physics, and better support for Steering Wheels. It feels better, and more realistic.

Dirt Rally 2 is still a much better game.

However, I wouldn't recommend buying this game at it's current state.",1699061980,1699062900,False,7,0,0.503031015396118164,3,True,False,False

What we got: WRC Game with Codemasters physics (mostly).

As a long time player of the CMR, Dirt, Dirt Rally and WRC series It must be said that this is probably the best ""whole game"" to date. But there are some pretty big BUTS.

Physics are a bit less DR and a bit more towards the WRC entries (Very Dirt4-ish). There is just so much grip everywhere now, you wont hold a powerslide on wet gravel/dirt, not even in a 400HP RWD car. I would say Tarmac is an improvement, but still retains some of the float of previous games. Cars still seem to pivot about an invisible centre wheel. Snow feels the best yet, Gravel a bit too grippy and wet gravel WAY too grippy. Room for improvement here. Its no longer an achievement keeping your car in one piece, its almost a given.

Stages, fantastic. Some better than others. Some with pretty bad lack of variation in assets and poor road surfaces, that same tree a billion times. But lengths and overall its good. Weather not so much, rain and snow look bad, like worse than DR and WRC bad. Water splashes and dirt on the car, also bad by comparison.

Car detail. Fantastic. Some feel a bit rushed and missing some authenticity. A few sounds that need work still (VR4 is a shocker). But overall its typical codies greatness. EDIT. I have gone back and compared and they really failed to port the DR2 sounds over. Watch a comparison video, Evo and WRX soudn THE SAME in WRC23. WTaF.

Career, Not really a fan. I feel like WRC Generations did a better job here with just a better example of running the team and using calendars/credits in useful ways.

Car builder. I still dont understand who actually wants to drive a nameless mish mash that doesn't have any pedigree on a rally stage?

Livery editor. Lacking. Clearly to help EA monetise something. Same with character customisation.
Also lack of historic liveries. Probably for monetising reasons as well.

No UDP telemetry. Clearly due to some agreement WRC/EA has in the background. Its possible, and been done with other WRC games through workarounds. Not good enough for a 2023 rally ""sim"".

No in game benchmark. a lack of a few settings previously seen in WRC and in DR, for no apparent reason. This is a bit of a trend. no VR, no support of well known SIM racing gear.

Regularity rally. Another ""who wants this?"" feature where you try not to get your fastest time possible ....... in a rally game.

Technical issues. I have not had the same issues as others. Some minimal stutters, some pop in. 90fps avg 3440x1440. 3080 + 10700KF + 32GB + NVMe. Overall it runs fine for ME.


Overall: It holds great promise if EA can show they are committed and listening and can spit out good patches quickly.
Otherwise it will be ""we fixed this in WRC 2024"" ""we'll fix that in WRC 2025"" ""add the VR DLC for $50"" and to me that is a real worry.",1698995819,1699062407,False,21,1,0.633627057075500488,0,True,False,False

As soon as the game launched I jumped on only to be immediately disappointed to find the state of the game was absolutely unplayable. The performance was abysmal. Constant stutters and freezes even when running over 100fps. I was super close to requesting a refund within the first 30 minutes. However I thought I'd hold on and try again in the morning. For context I have a RTX 3080 and a Ryzen 7 5800x. And the game is installed on a gen 4 M.2 so I was not anticipating any performance issues.

To my surprise when I booted it up the next day the game ran like butter. I could crank the settings up, run at native resolution all while keeping a locked 60 fps and not a single stutter. I can only assume this must have something to do with the game compiling shaders. I've heard people discussing this may be the cause of most stutters. I'm still very disappointed they decided to release the game in this state if this is actually the case. I would have been fine with just a little pop up message to tell you whats going on, but if there was I must have missed it. 

The game itself is a fantastic improvement upon dirt rally 2.0. The stages are wonderful, the quality and quantity is something to behold. The tarmac physics improvements while not perfect make for a complete package now. The career mode is surprisingly in depth. I like how it's not just one event after another. Your team has a budget and you only have limited time to attend events every week meaning you have to make meaningful choices in which event you choose to partake in.

Overall it's a great game, maybe overshadowed by some technical difficulties. Hopefully these just turn out to be teething issues.

The game was released in an unfinished state. Shader compilation stutter is terrible and could have been addressed. I fear that this is only part of a much larger, uglier picture though. I suspect there are deeper frame time issues that will keep the game from feeling smooth even when the shader precompilation step is added in the next patch. 

What's even more sad is that this game is a big step back visually from the almost 4 year old Dirt Rally 2.0. 

- A lot of trees and foliage look like they are made of cardboard
- Water looks like something out of Tomb Raider 2
- Lighting is inconsistent and not very believable
- Lack of AO means shadows are not good and nothing feels grounded
- Reflections (except for car reflections) look terrible (again, little puddles on the road in DR2.0 looked really nice in comparison)
- NPC's look like lifeless ventriloquist dummy's. The co-driver is downright creepy. The marshalls float inches above the ground
- Photomode is broken, after processing image there's weird aliasing
- Terrible groundcover pop-in, especially bad in replays

All this while getting much worse performance on pretty high end gear (4080) than in DR 2.0

The handling fixed everything I hated about Dirt Rally 2.0. The cars have a much more pronounced suspension now, which you can really see now when braking hard, and the surfaces' grips have been highly improved. People who are raving about the cars having ""too much grip"" don't seem to get how efficient these modern rally cars are. The WRC1 cars, even on tarmac, can slip quite easily when putting down too much power. The cars also feel much heavier, which is good.

The switch to Unreal Engine has been a little rough. The game looks worse than DR2 and runs with half as much fps, but the longer stages are a great addition. Hopefully they can patch these performance issues quickly enough.

Biggest issue with the game is performance. Luckily for me, I have a pc that I can run max settings 4k at 60 fps and get minimal stutters. Although, I have one huge performance issue. There is a spot at Monte Carlo(the stage that resembles real life Monte Carlo) where my game crashes no matter what. This has resulted my in being forced to retire from or skip any Monte Carlo event in career mode.

Tarmac physics are better. Cars actually have realisticish feeling grip now, except on the loss grip cars will regain grip very abruptly, it can feel very strange. Overall, the new tarmac physics are still the best of any rally game.

EA leaves it's signature mark on the game, however, nothing very egregious or that affects gameplay.

The real life stages stand out, but the fictional ones are very technical and flowing as well.

I won't be comparing this to RBR or Dirt or even Kylotonn WRC games of past. I'm looking at this game as it is on its own. This game could be someone's first to see what rally is and on that note I cannot recommend this right now.
This is fun to drive, I will play more, but EA cannot get away with this. This needed more time and it severely lacks immersion.

I play on keyboard and it is fun. Driving on tarmac is great and I enjoy the stage variety. In this motorsport, every second and reaction is crucial and this game stutters way too much. Even with the latest NVIDIA drivers, there are hiccups that can cause an unnecessary response and end a stage or rally. 
Whatever game engine they're using, I do not care, these issues had to be ironed out before release. I would have been fine with a delayed game if it means the game will be great. There is a cool game here, I believe in that.

If you bought the VIP reason pass - congrats - you cannot get all the rewards. Some are locked behind 'EA Play'. Some Moments are also locked behind EA Play. EA Play is $30/year. (:
I won't say much more. (:

I mention lacking immersion. This game lacks it to almost an absurd degree from both EA and CodeMasters. 
The trophies in career mode are the exact same for rally wins in JWRC. WRC2. Really? Not even slightly different. The graphic is the exact same too. I've yet to get to WRC since I'm repeating WRC2, but this is just bad worse if the WRC level has identical trophies. In reality, the top WRC level has trophies specific to the location. They did not need to duplicate those trophies, but they could have at least tried to make it different! 
Your driver doesn't even stand outside the car and wave to the crowd. There is [b]no[/b] crowd. When you win the overall championship, JWC or WRC2, there is no celebration. It does not feel like an achievement. Your Chief Engineer is the most excited out of anybody. Your CoDriver doesn't even murmur a congratulations.
Molly Pettit is a cool addition, especially since she's the WRC reporter and commentator. In career mode, she only has 1, maybe 2, lines of dialog when you win a rally? On the last day of a rally, her dialog almost never changes. When you win the JWRC, it sounds so broad that she is congratulating the 'World Champion' which sounds like it is going to be used for the WRC Champion dialog in career mode. 
This is a small detail, but the flags in this game are comically bad. The waving makes no sense, it's always the same. In career mode, you're 'climbing the ranks' to be the best of the world, yet there was no way to put your nationality flag into the crowd when you're getting more wins or 'climbing up'? Sure, you rally and you shouldn't pay attention to flags, but in Regularity Rally you're driving slow and you can see everything and how bad and lacking it is.
Some wooden fences and small trees are made of steel, apparently. The shrubs in Finland and Estonia could stop your car in an instant. There is limited environmental damage which is upsetting because sometimes you do veer off too much but it's just as cool to continue on, flat out.

The livery editor does not have a mirror function for decals. It does not have any indicator of angle, scale, size, or location of decals that you place. Right now, it's all done by eye. You cannot even copy/paste a decal from the same angle, only delete. This seems incredibly primitive.
You also cannot share designs. What a shame.

I like the idea of the Builder Mode in Career, you get to build your own car as if you were Colin. I liked the amount of options in it, including the skull shift knob. I would keep expanding on this mode and keep it because that was a great idea.

The music is awesome. I love the music soundtrack so far. Kudos to getting all the tracks. It's almost 2 hours of music, which helps from music repeating over and over in menus.

The career mode is interesting how you have a 'Benefactor' and you could swap out cars weekly if the cars are not entered in competitions. I don't really like the calendar system fully, but it's been alright to go through.

This game is fun, has a good car variety, but it severely lacks immersion.
EA Play is a roadblock. The livery editor is bland.

I did, and I loved it.

I'm not sure if I like this one better or not...

First of all, the overall driving feeling is very similar to WRC Generations (that's a good thing but when people say ""it's an improvement from Dirt Rally 2"", I'm sorry but that's BS, this is not Dirt Rally 3, it's a new WRC iteration, even if it's made by another company) and it feels great. The rocks and other stuff along the road are a lot more forgiving than in WRCG, most of the time you can hit a rock and still continue and do a great time (in WRCG you would have come to a stop).
Speaking of shifting gears, I believe you can go from 1rst to Reverse and back to 1rst much more quickly in this game. So overall it's less punishing.

The multiplayer part, for now at least, isn't very engaging and you need to use a browser to join or create clubs. That s*cks IMO and I preferred how it was done in WRCG.

I like that we can ""create"" our car but that's not very useful... Right off the bat you have like 3 choices for each part, and 2 of them are used or cheap parts, so you pick the 3rd and best one. I guess there might be other choices to unlock but I haven't played enough yet.

I often go down to fps in the twenties on my laptop with a 3060 in 1080p medium with dlss balanced when I otherwise get over 60. This must be fixed. This game looks worse in almost every way than dirt rally 2.0 which is the last game in the ""series"" while being much worse performance wise. It doesn't matter if they switched engine or that their levels are longer, it is still unacceptable to have worse graphics AND MUCH worse performance than the last game.

The codrivers seem really bored and uninterested. In Dirt Rally 2.0 the codriver got really stressed when you drove really fast and calmer if you drove slowly. The codriver also commented on how the stage went. This all lead to the codriver Phil to have a personality and he felt much more real than the monotone and bored codrivers that we have now. In this game they're often to late or don't emphasize important calls like triple caution when a ton of other calls are being thrown out at the same time. This makes the game harder than it realistically would.

The AI is also really bad. Using the same difficulty as Dirt Rally 2.0 I won a rally with five stages, where my car was trashed through the majority, by over 5 minutes. That is ridiculous as I struggled to be top 5 in the Dirt Rally 2.0.

Well if you like Dirt Rally 2.0 you are going to absolutely love this. It is nice to see a games company actually releasing an almost finished game, I mean honestly what happened? Why do they all release crap & then fix it on the way?

The graphics are bang on & the content is brilliant. So good in fact that I genuinely believe drivers will be able to get genuine stage practice in. Oh btw they have REAL rally stages from the entire WRC calendar & more. The cars are something else. I thought DR2 (Dirt Rally) had a great selection (even though admittedly a lot were DLC), WRC has the cars from the get go. I'm talking S1600,S2K, Group 4, GrpA &of course Grp B. Basically if a car has been rallied & stirred an emotion in you then I will bet my left bollock hair that it is in the game!

Gameplay is also brilliant. If you liked the physics of DR2 then you will feel like you are sitting in your comfy chair (you know the one that has been shaped to you for years). Now thats not to say that it is same old same old because oh no...... The improvements are there to see & feel, there may be a slight learning curve to figure it out but I promise you. The reward you get for mastering this & taming any car on the snow & ice of Sweden is epic.

I can't comment too much on more of the game aspects because I have only had 9 hours at it & being honest.... I am wasting time writing this when I should be on stage! However it is that good of a game it's worth me stopping to tell you fine folk about it.

Yes there are a couple of issues but come on - It's not out yet & I'm sure release day may have a couple of updates (BUT they will be minor....Take note Turn10). The main downside for me after playing DR2 is the distinct lack of any form of head tracking or VR compatibility.

I have read that they are working on it & it will be an added feature by 2024.... Lets be straight though whilst only 2 months away (1st of November as a write this) it is a very vague time frame. Come on Codemasters, finish the year strong & give us VR for Christmas!!!

Bloody brilliant game & if you have read this far then well done you! I just have one question for you though?

WHY AREN'T YOU PLAYING THIS GAME???

A solid 8.5/10 from me but that will go to 9.5 should head tracking & VR appear.
until then & in the immortal words of the great Colin Mcrae ""If in doubt.....Flat out"".

-Really like the new physics/handling and improved audio
-Like that there now is a livery editor
-New maps and cars but that is to expect

Don't like:
-Ship optimization and graphics, I play on 3440x1440 with a GTX1080. DR2 runs at 100+ fps with everything on medium-high which looks nice, WRC only gets me 80-90fps max with everything on very low which looks shit so I turn up some settings to low-mid which gets me somewhat stable 60fps. 
-THEY REMOVED FREE ROAM
-The livery editor is unusable for multiple reasons;
   -anytime you change the colour the game drop down to 15 fps, 4 fps anytime you try to move/add a decal.
   -there is no colour palette, instead you have to move a slider for colour, brightness and saturation separately. 
   -said sliders move at a snails pace
-New menu is ugly, let me remove my ugly avatar or atleast put his helmet on I can't take his soulless stare any longer

I've never been keen on Unreal for sim games, but this has been implemented quite well in WRC's case. However, a few of the usual UE issues present themselves. Namely, stutters will be present for a while whilst shaders are built. After running a stage, these mostly disappear. With a 4080, I get great FPS on Ultra settings. (apart from in Monte Carlo, which desperately needs a performance patch!). My Thrustmaster TX wheel & T-LCM pedals perform well from the outset, with some adjustments needed in the in-game force feedback settings.

Sounds are brilliant, especially with the faster cars. A real step up from Nacon's sounds!

ANYONE SUFFERING WITH FPS ISSUES, TURN DOWN CAR REFLECTIONS. My FPS doubled after turning it down. (If in doubt, turn them down)

So far this feels like a new entry in the dirt series, which is a good thing. Most car models and handling physics seem to be on par with Dirt 2.0, and it is the career mode where we see a step forward in the series with a more real life/calendar based system akin to the previous WRC franchise, but done well, in a way that you actually do feel like you race, instead of playing management mini games. I also take as a positive the fact that it is not mandatory to build your own car (I disliked this since revealed based on the extremely generic looking car models, why would I pick one of these atrocious models over an Impreza?) and you can actually buy real world cars in game. 

Event and track length can be customized according to your preferences as well as AI difficulty.

Graphics are ok, nothing to write home about, however with the inclusion of DLSS for nvidia cards, quality is noticeably reduced, especially in the mirror reflection when using the cockpit view, as these leave a trail common of the DLSS technique, I would rather not use DLSS but the performance does take a big hit. Perhaps optimization is in order here.

Audio seems to be similar to Dirt 2 for the most part, except the mix does not seem to be done quite right. Gravel and rocks hitting the car can be heard if you pay close attention, because that particular sound effect is way too muffled, this definitely needs fixing as it's not just the gravel effects but others feel like they were either panned incorrectly or reduced to the point that you wonder why even leave them there. The product is an uncanny feel when effects play and it feels like a step back from DIrt 2.

Battle pass! I mean...VIP or whatever pass. Of course EA was going to prey on our wallets, and they chose a battle pass system where you earn cosmetic rewards for the driver such as helmet and suit colors, among other rewards that seem to be locked only for those who have EA pass, essenttially it is not enough to purchase the game and the battle passes but you also have to pay up even more for their subscription service to be able to get the full advantage of the pass. I know I know, it is not a surprise but no one likes this and we have to be vocal with this kind of trash.

The one feature I have not been able to find out if it is included or not is world leaderboards ion special events. Dirt 2.0 had events every week where your time competed with others globally however I havent found where if at all this was included. 

Overall I believe the core game is great, I've had fun which is the most important part, however, fun can be diminished when predatory companies such as EA take a hold of otherwise balanced franchises, so in this regard I would say be wary, it's EA after all, but at least this game at the moment is leagues better than the dumpster fire battlefield 2042 was/is.",1699029325,1699029325,True,2,0,0.545954883098602295,0,True,False,False

While the game definitely feels better than Dirt Rally 2, especially on asphalt, the game definitely took several technical steps back. There are some spots where dirt effects from previous runs persist on the course, completely blocking visibility on the track. There's certain tracks where stuttering regularly occurs due to shaders loading in and it throws off whatever rhythm I had built up, completely throwing me off. In replays, this will show up too as well as some random texture popping. Perhaps I'm too used to Dirt Rally 2's floatiness as well but aggressive bumps on the road and some harsh geometry is just enough to send the car flying. Without the EGO engine, the damage models for the cars also seem off where the same harsh geometry that can send a car flying can also inexplicably leave it still looking somewhat new after recovery. 

Graphics wise, the inexperience with Unreal is pretty clear here too. There are clean cars, and then there are cars that just look too clean. It looks like Codemasters used the same metallic texture for all the cars giving them this sterile exterior look. The tracks make me wish that they used a little more lighting here and there as well to at least give the game some mood. Human models on the track, while they're rarely seen aside from the start, also look somewhat underbaked. The game does look pretty in flashes but everything just feels off. 

It's kind of a shame that the game looks this way because it does have the formula to be a better simcade than Dirt Rally 2. The tracks are overall much better to drive through and the driving is tuned a little better. It also released with more vehicles than DR2 did which is such a huge plus.

[h1]A mix of Dirt Rally 2.0 and WRC-games:[/h1]
As for the nonsense-conversation if the car pivits arround this or that pivot point: it doesn't matter. It matters if the [b]handling feels well [/b] and it indeed does feel well.

If you liked the former Rally games you can absolutely buy this game without any fear. It handels like Dirt Rally [i] 2.5 [/i] and is set up like a WRC game. (which means you won't have the intuitive ego engine menu but rather a more ugly UI)
+ Stages are unique and exciting - great
+ cars are great
+ sound is great
+ everything you want
+ they did everything they could with Unreal Engine i am astonished

[h1]A few things to watch out for:[/h1]
- [b]The co-driver[/b] has now more detailed callouts for the corners, but lacks a bit of emersion
THUS having a [u]main problem of calling things way to late![/u] I tripple checked if i have set it to ""earlierst"" and i have. When the co-driver says 1 right you instantly have to brake full time otherwise you will not make the corner. Even worse when he says 6 right into 1. You will crash. I am really stunned why you have no option to have earlier callouts. The co-driver only tells you what you see so therefore you can turn him/her off because there is literal no use to him calling out so late. I havent play much in the fast WRC/GB where it must be even worse i think.

[b]- Music: [/b]every Codies game has insanely good menu soundtrack. A cross the board. This one's different. You really really have to get used to it. I am trying. It is really different.

[b]- AI is way to easy.[/b] On 100 difficulty (max) its not hard to pull 30s on the 2nd driver if you played rally games before and make no mistake. So expect a boring singleplayer and focus on TT oder online events (for now?)

[b] - hardcore damage [/b] is so lush why is it labled with hardcore?

[b] input lag[/b] is so immense when in cockpitcam and having driver arms on. Its more than in NFS Shift 2 (if u know you know) at 120fps 144hz monitor about 0.5s. But i am not sure if it is only cosmetical, because driving in a view where you dont see the wheel you dont notice it (and i say that hating minimal inputlag) so unsure point

- [b]no car dependend automatic switch between h-pattern + clutch and seq shifting [/b] Whyyy??

My own reflection: So the negative points a heavily inflicting the gameplay and dampen the enjoyment, but as they are relatively easy to fix i still recommend as the official release date is not even there.
But i still wonder how they can make a great game - and i even have the feeling we got a complete game released! - but obviously still have not sufficient testers. I don't see how anyone couldn't see the enormous input lag, or the go kart slow AI, or if the testers manually shiftet between h pattern and seq shifter or had no problems with getting corner calls too late, i puzzled how one doesn't see these obvious flaws - aber steckst nicht drin.
But these are point Codies can fix and i am looking forward to it :) Thank you again for the awesome rally experience and i will constructively forward issues via suitable plattforms.

Bye & thanks!

I like the commentator, I love the stages and cars so far, across the board.  I love the format sort of like a cross between Dirt 4, F1 2023, DR2 and old school WRC games I cannot remember the name of, awesome, my own team and career in what looks like a pretty serious format, cool beans, man, I can seriously dig it.

Turned off all the assists from the start, the physics are really good, as good as I can remember since day one with World Circuit, I have driven most of these games at least a little.  I drove the same car in game I drove in real life more than 50 years ago, I swear it felt like the same car.

Zero improvement over the WRC series and perhaps even a step back from WRC generations, with fuzzy graphics and terrible performance stutters combined with low fps.  Very arcadey to play with almost infinite grip.  Feels like a really dumbed down console only game, where unless you physically drive into an obstacle that would stop the car it is almost impossible to crash.  What this also does is make the game boring to the point where you can just plough through the stage without any car or attention for what is coming. The feeling of speed is great but there is no consequence for this if you make a small error of judgement. The tarmac physics are almost laughable it is almost like you are stuck on rails and forget using the handbrake as it feels weird and un-intuitive to use. Definitely not as good as dirt 2 and also doesn't feel as challenging to drive as WRC Generations. 

This combined with a lack of support for motion set ups, triple monitors and the generally poor visuals and stuttering makes this a big miss so far. Disappointing over all when compared to Dirt rally 2. There is a great selection of stages and cars but very little to be said for the difficulty level. This feels like it was made for console and joypad only and is purely an arcade driving game.

Also the performance issues are horrific. I run a Ryzen 5 3600x and RTX 2080 TI and have to run the game on medium settings for smooth performance. At the same time the game doesn't look that good and should definitely not be running as crap as it does now.",1699026055,1699026055,False,2,0,0.518867909908294678,0,True,False,False

Pros:
- Many cars and stages, they put a lot of efforts to the tracks and cars, very long stages
- Car builder is interesting
- WRC Electric powered booster haha
- EA didn't do microtransactions in this game, thanks god.

Cons:
- Bad Dynamics: Car and environment are not as natural as Dirt Rally 2, just doesn't get the feel right. I can't feel like sliding through mud and dirt in this game. It feels like Asseto Corsa with a Rally Mods, lets put it that way.
- Graphics is shit: The raining and snow effect are like jokes, i'd say NFS underground 2 had better rain and water splash effect than this.
- Bad optimization: shutters all the time with my 3080ti

Overall as a game made by Codemasters, which is supposed to be the best racing game studio that made Dirt and Grid series, didn't meet my expectation, they could have just used the same engine as Dirt Rally 2.0, and add in the stages and cars, and make a killing rally game out of it. The game feels like a downgrade from DR and DR2.0, at this point I don't think there can me massive upgrades to the game to fix the dynamics, graphics and performance unfortunately.

Positives:
-Much more content than in DR 2.0 
-Real time multiplayer, where you can see others driving the stage if you finish earlier than them.
-Can make own livery for every car.
-Builder mode is nice little addition, although there aren't so much content.
-Real stages, and them are nice looking and not boring like in DR 2.0
-Now you can't do so big cuts as in DR 2.0, or if you do so you will get time penalty.
-Fairly priced
-Sounds are very good, maybe the overall biggest success in this game.
 
Negatives:
-Many performance issues, should be fixed soon.
-Game crashes such often, should be fixed soon.
-No automatic change between H-manual and sequential shifting modes, so every time you change between cars you have to change it manually in the settings.

I haven't put much hours into Dirt Rally 2 (about 50 hours) but it was a rewarding and somewhat challenging 50 hours. This primarily carries on the fun level of that. The amount of cars and stages in this game are WAY more than DR22 could ever have and each one seems unique and isn't just the same stage rehashed like 5 times unlike DR2.

However, the main cons I have is just simply related to performance. My PC with a 3600x and a 6800 XT on DR2 on average gets around 120 FPS on high running at 1440p. This with the same hardware and graphics settings gets about 70. Don't get me wrong it's not terrible but it can be better. That and sometimes hitting a jump or going into a puddle causes frames to dip a bit which isn't good.

One wish back in the early DiRT Days was the WRC License to be given to Codies and it happened finally.

On this game:
As of early access and release day the game is heavily unoptimized and the AI is incredibly inconsistent. Driving against them competitively even on 100% difficulty is not possible at the moment. This seems to be a bug though as the inconsistency is vastly over the top and usually isn't a problem with a codemasters game. (Speaking of +/- 4 minutes swings depending on stage)

The rest of the game is just perfection. You notice a little dated graphics and the core racing hasn't changed a lot from DiRT Rally 2.0 but this is in no way a bad thing. Every problem about DiRT Rally 2.0 has been fixed here, mainly the tarmac physics which in my opinion are now quite good with the tyres now feeling like they are gripping into the road. The Career mode is very refreshing and focuses on a lot of variety. The game gives you a little push in certain directions but doesn't force you in anyway to follow it's designated path. You can race however you like if you want but can let yourself guide through it too.

And then there is the racing. Oh boyyy I feel like the cars sound even better than before and in terms of difficulty it is as always. Dark Souls on wheels (Shut up Richard Burns rally fan. It's difficult enough this).

If you really need a challenge that melts your brain:

Group B on the Safari Stages (you won't find yourself in control of the car at any moment. The Throttle is basically Hyperdrive and the brakes are worse than that of a train)

or

WRC cars on any tarmac rally (just as fast in a straight line as a Group B car but with actual brakes and blistering speeds through the corners that melt your brain)

EA for now definitely doesn't seem to have killed this franchise so it's a massive plus from me. Absolute dream of a rally game and a must for every masochistic Simracer like myself. As I said: Dark Souls on wheels.

I haven't seen any games with UE5 yet but I'm hoping this isn't how they're all going to look and perform. About the only meaningful improvements over UE4 I could spot was LOD doesn't pop as much and shadows had a much better draw distance but boy is it blurry! Incredibly turning AA down makes it worse. OK, I'll turn off DLSS. Yikes not what I expecting. The game actual NEEDS DLSS or upscaling on to maintain sharpness! Turn it off and it turns into fuzzy, shimmering soup. There's draw-in galore as road detail gets added right in front of the nose of your car and stuttering that goes from minor to ""did I just black out for a minute""? Worst of all, at 4K I don't see anything much above mid 70's FPS on a 4090 (so god help anybody else). It's line ball whether this is an improvement over the old engine and certainly not worth the massive performance hit. 
TrackIR doesn't work as far a I know and I went through the options looking how it might be enabled. This means much of the time your turning in without being able to see the corner. The in-car camera is welded firmly to the car while the outside view jerks around making it difficult to see sometimes. Even with motion blur off the view seems smeared, so likely attributable to the AA.  Handling seems OK; understeers out of the box but I haven't had a chance to try tuning yet. Menu's and presentation are all stock Codemasters, so not bad. Sound is a mixed bag. Again maybe I can fiddle with the options but effects seemed muffled and the snaps and pops of rocks and dirt hitting the car floor pan almost absent. One good thing is all my controls worked straight up with no fiddling. I did have some minor issues with the game not allowing me to select a rez higher than 2560x1440 but seemed to fix itself after restarting a few times. Might add or subtract from this review depending on further use but didn't want to burn too much time as I'm definitely mulling refunding as the game performs badly and isn't as good as DR2 at this time.
-edit: I've done some testing as I'd read posts claiming 120fps 4K at Ultra. I'll call BS on this. Even turning things way down with DLSS yielded no more the 90's on Greece. The graphics at this point look way worse than any WRC game. Not all the stuttering is due to shader compilation either. Tracks have places where they stutter at the same place regardless. Apparently the game isn't UE5 either which is a relief. I was concerned about future games built on UE5 if they ran this bad. I've decided on a refund.

Game overall feels like a one step forward, two steps back. In DR2 you had to master each car, drivetrain, class, event and so on, it was a perfect balance between sim and arcade - here you can just get in any car and finish every stage with ease, it might seem fun but gets stale and boring. Force feedback is lacking, cars seem too easy to drive - you can drive a kit car on the limit and it wont ever slip for a second, no under or oversteer - its like train on tracks or rather all classes drive like rally 1.
Sound is a subjective topic, but i would say cars seem to have ""more"" sounds like some mechanical stuff, not just engines and turbos, but they dont seem as exciting and meaty as in DR 2, especially from the inside, some people say some cars sound horrible, some will say they are great. Id say its mostly ok-ish, possibly its more realistic than DR2, but les exciting none the less.
Graphics look like they are from 2014, i wouldnt mind if i bought the game on sale, but im paying full price so yeah - its bad.
Optimalization will surely improve but on day one its reaaaally bad, lots of freezing and fps drops.
Menu also feels worse than in DR 2 - why the hell car classes are diffrent ""submenus"" ? I cant see what cars are in a specific class.

From friends that put up club events - its a mess and its full of horrible ideas, big step back from DR2, cant set up weather or surfaces degredation for each stage, cant do anything from mobile device and many other cons.
Overall i doubt putting more time into this game will change my mind and most likekly i wont recomment this game at all, unless EA will improve most of the things above, for now Dirt Rally 2.0 is still the king and the Jack of all trades when it comes to rally games, this is still kinda fun but arcade as hell.",1699018893,1699019466,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Disclaimer: This is my first rally game in decades. I faintly remember playing Colin McRae in the 90s, but that's it. So I have no experience with the predecessors of this game.

I really enjoy getting into the zone, listening to the co-driver call outs, and traversing the beautiful and varied countrysides at breakneck speeds. I love the fact that it has all these old cars of the various generations and for a gen-Xer like me there is nothing like pretending to be back in the 80s, for obvious non-Rally related reasons.

I don't disagree with the majority of the criticism levelled at this game, but they all are minor issues for me, far outweighed by how much fun it is to blast down these dirt, snow and paved tracks. 

I am playing with a G923 with the H-shifter with clutch and I enjoy the physics a lot, feels like a car to me and is not as unforgiving as Forza physics, where it's often impossible to recover after a mistake. When driving up the mountain on one of the Rally Monte Carlo stages, the way the change from dry tarmac to increasingly wet and icy conditions is expressed, visually and in car behavior, feels authentic and I've never experienced it like that in a video game.

I think the various camera options are awesome. I always play racing games in some first-person/cockpit mode and there are numerous ones to choose from. The replay camera options are also great, and it's fun to watch your performance with the TV style camera with all HUD elements off.

So far, I actually like the career mode with the calendar and the overlapping events that need to be managed. 

When it comes to the issues, I've encountered the following problems:

I have a reoccurring DX12 crash in career mode as discussed on a forum post here on steam. By using '-Force -DX11' this has been resolved for now. It happens so often, I'm confident it will be fixed rather soon.

I am playing on a 13900K with a 3090 and have no performance issues detrimental to gameplay. I'm running everything Ultra at 4K with DLSS at Auto. But the performance issues others mention are noticeable in that on some stages FPS are in the 40s and in others they are in the 100s.

When using the clutch-manual mode the car does not switch gear unless doing so while the clutch is fully depressed, which is not something natural to do during a heated race. There is some clutch override mode I'm using to alleviate the problem and perhaps this can be fixed by giving the clutch a large dead-zone, but I have not experimented with it more.

Some of the bad/blurry visuals are baffling at times. When you look closely there is great detail in the foliage and textures but I agree with the criticism that sometimes things look blurry. Perhaps LOD issue or something.

Finally, not sure if it is my driving or if there is something wrong with AI difficulty, but, while keeping the same AI difficulty percentage, in one series I can easily win while in another I'm last.

Losing a tire because the game stuttered after going flat-out on a big jump is annoying, and missing so many standard simulator features like triple/VR support, SimHub telemetry and TrackIR on release is just disappointing.

sitting in youre car instead of seeing it from outside gives you a 20fps boost sometimes but not always..

Jumping in here now that the game is fully released.

I don't have valid credentials to discuss stuff like aspects of realism or how the surfaces and cars should feel, but I can say for sure that this is a great game and it has met my expectations when pre-ordering it. 

I do definetly hate when people compare this to games like Richard Burns Rally, when the goal of games like WRC and Dirt Rally is for them to also be accessible to casual players or people not as interested in simulators. I do see people calling this game arcadish in nature but I disagree and still feel its well grounded in reality. 

What I like:
- The cars are really fun on wheel. The basic force-feedback settings are definitely preferable to DR2 in my experience and made just a little bit better by adjusting some settings that may cause clipping.
- Courses are great and look good, though I wish we had a little more unique roads per layout and that graphics more optimised. (3060 sometimes can just make the game look like ass)
- Camera mode finally has a freecam, something that has been severely missing from DR2.
- The game is targeted more toward casual players, but still is fun for us sim players.

What I dislike:
- Rallypass, another game another live-service battlepass system, I am glad atleast it doesn't involve important things like vehicles but still very wack.
- Livery System, the controls are jank, let me just use my mouse and stuff please. Also some sort of custom decals system like in Forza would be cool, or even importing SVGs like in Gran Turismo. Not that big of a deal, but it'd make it a whole lot more fun.
- Lack of transparency regarding if game will remain live-service or will act as a yearly thing. It seems the team is still undecided which annoys me.
- Can't chose season in time trials, have to go quick race for it, not a big deal but just why?
- Optimisation is ass, I was hoping it'd be patched out by now but nooo

Beside that, while I do list alot of negatives I still love the game. Wishful Thinking:

- More cars, there is a great amount of cars and I need to get around to driving them all but I really wish we had some more rare historic cars like the Stratospolonez, hell I'd be up to pay for it if the price is right.
- Rally GT to be brought back, while I understand it's WRC and not Dirt Rally anymore I was sort of hoping they'd also end up in this game like the historic vehicles are, it's not a big deal but I'd love to rip them around the asphalt stages like Japan.",1699009457,1699015677,True,2,0,0.540620088577270508,1,True,False,False

The game is really fun. And yes there are some lags at the moment. But it is still the release patch.
And to be fair, the lags only appear when crashing or splashing through water. And those lags will mostly happen once and then will be fine.

There are also a couple other problems that bother me.

Firstly i cant bind my ""pause"" key to another button. It would be nice if i could decide what button i use to pause the game.

Secondly in ""Hokono Lake"" the is a graphics bug at about halfway through the stage where a white road line shows though a wall on the left.

And lastly and my biggest issue. I am using a Wheel to drive and for navigation through the menu i am using a mouse. But then the issue appears that the game wants to scroll through the menu using the mouse scroll input but then goes back to the original position because it wants me to use my wheel. Also if i move the mouse to the side of the screen it scrolls but sometimes it does not. So i think overall menu navigation could be better.

I think for the navigation issue it would be best that the game checks in menus if the mouse is being moved and if yes then it completely ignores controller input except for maybe buttons if one wants to navigate with the mouse but wants to click on a button using a wheel button

So basically the game is great from a strict gameplay perspective. The biggest issue that remains is the Menu Navigation. If you use anything else but a Controller you will have a terrible experience. So if you can overlook problems like this then this game is awesome. If you will get triggered by stuff like this this will be hard to play ^^

I personally love the game and hate the Navigation issues.",1699014401,1699014401,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

But it is, and frankly is unforgivable to release a game in this state. I'm playing on a RTX 3070, i7 12700k, 16 GB RAM and even if I turn the settings down to the absolute bare minimum to the point it looks like an early to mid 2000's game, it still runs like crap. Playing around with graphics settings didn't change performance much, if at all so you may as well run on high. I also encountered included severe pop in of environments and flickering shadows from trees.

Graphically the game doesn't even look that good, much worse than DR2 and still worse than recent WRC titles from KT Racing. The cars can look good but the track surfaces and environments are very washed out. Lighting is often far too bright making seeing the road near impossible, especially from interior cameras.

So at this point if the physics and game play were at least fun, the game could be still MAYBE be worth a look if you're a die hard Rally fan. But sadly this isn't the case for the most part. The core issue is that the cars have too much grip so you cannot slide around corners (you know the way a rally car is supposed to). You can forget about using the handbrake to try get the nose of the car pointing towards the exit of hairpins to shave off time because cars will stubbornly refuse to break traction. This game plays like a circuit racer taking typical racing lines. Driving is simply not challenging, even in powerful RWD cars. The cars often feel very muted and stale to drive because they lack the visual feedback you would expect when slamming the brake or turning aggressively into a corner. So the driving rarely feels alive and fun which makes the addition of long stages seem a bit of a chore after 10-15 minutes or more on the same stretch of road. This does depend a lot on the stages though which can be a bit of a mixed bag. Some of the new fictional stages like Norway and Indonesia are great additions with a variety of environments and driving situations. On the other end of the spectrum you have Croatia which is essentially long stretches of flat out 5th and 6th gear corners followed up with the same looking hairpins with the same copy pasted trees for most of the stage. Easy to lose your concentration when it all looks the same, and doubly so when the co driver has a very flat monotonous voice, unlike Phil Mills from DR2. 

Lastly, the crash physics have regressed considerably. I crashed into a log pile on Finland at over 150kph and my car bounced right off and kept going. Any other rally game and that would have been terminal damage. Ramming into a wooden fence is similarly disappointing; bouncing right off it and back onto the track rather than crashing through.

This game had potential, and maybe it still does. But they chose to release this game in a poor state with questionable design choices, and so it gets a negative review from me.

Of the pluses:
-Lots of rallies and much longer sections, like 2 of the stages from many long stages: 34 km long and over 20 minutes long.
-Lots of cars and their classes
-A more extensive career mode compared to the DiRT Rally series
-Physics that reflects the behavior of each class of cars, you can feel the difference when you jump from the current Rally 1 Category to, for example, the older Subaru Impreza 98 or later to Group B ""RWD""
-Graphics, it's not perfect next gen, but you can feel the differences on the plus side when you play it yourself rather than watching it on YouTube
-The sound of the cars is amazing, especially in the cockpit, every turbo sound or whistle, the sound characteristics for a given car model are very noticeable and if you watch real videos, you can hardly see the difference.
-Multiplayer for a huge number of people, probably 28 players or more, including the so-called clubs, i.e. ""Leagues in which you can take part in rallies organized by the community""

Of the minuses:
-First of all, optimization > The creators have not yet managed to tame the new graphics engine in time for the premiere, but currently they are 100% focused on improving the situation
-There are some features missing and some bugs that the developers have to deal with and they listen to people on their official Discord with many EA/Codemasters members and their dedicated Forum.

Apart from the minuses regarding the game itself: ""None"". It's been a long time since I've seen such a groundbreaking rally game, since maybe the first parts of DiRT or the Colin McRae Rally series or even the old WRC for PlayStation 2.

Polish: Jestem zadowolony z tej symulacji jaką Codemasters przedstawiło. Można teraz na własnej skórze odczuć jak szybkie i łatwe w prowadzeniu są rajdówki obecnej generacji jakimi są Rally 1, do tego bardzo ciekawy tryb budowania rajdówki, tryb kariery gdzie można zarządzać zespołem czy możliwość zrobienia własnych mistrzostw by reprezentować jednego z kierowców, niestety nie pomyślano jeszcze o tym by dać możliwość pojechania we własnym imieniu ale twórcy na pewno ogarną wiele rzeczy albo w przyszłych aktualizacjach jeśli gra będzie miała wsparcie w kwestii corocznych aktualizacji lub w razie wypuszczenia kolejnej części.

Z plusów:
-Mnóstwo rajdów i znacznie dłuższe odcinki o długości 34km i czasie ponad 20 minut.
-Mnóstwo samochodów oraz ich klas
-W stosunku do serii DiRT Rally bardziej rozbudowany tryb kariery
-Fizyka która oddaje zachowania każdej klasy aut czuć różnicę kiedy się przeskoczy z obecnej Kategorii Rally 1 do np. starszej Subaru Imprezy 98 lub później jeszcze do Grupy B ""RWD""
-Grafika, nie jest to idealny next gen ale czuć różnice na plus kiedy się w to samemu zagra niż poogląda na YouTube
-Dźwięk aut jest niesamowity w szczególności w kokpicie każdy dźwięk turbo czy świst charakterystyka dźwięku dla danego model auta jest bardzo odczuwalna i jak się obejrzy prawdziwe filmiki to prawie nie widać różnicy.
-Multiplayer dla ogromnej liczby osób bodajże 28 graczy albo więcej w tym tzw. kluby czyli ""Ligi w której można brać udział w rajdach organizowanych przez społeczność""

Z minusów:
-Przede wszystkim optymalizacja > Twórcom nie udało się ""jeszcze"" w porę okiełznać nowego silnika graficznego na premierę jednak obecnie są w 100% skupieni na poprawie sytuacji
-Brak niektórych funkcji i nieco błędów z którymi twórcy muszą się uporać i słuchają ludzi na oficjalnym Discordzie ze sporą ilością osób z EA/Codemasters oraz przeznaczonym do tego Forum.

Poza tym z minusów dotyczącej samej gry: ""Brak"" Dawno nie widziałem tak przełomowej gry rajdowej od czasu może tych pierwszych części DiRT lub serii Colin McRae Rally czy nawet starych WRC pod PlayStation 2.",1699013788,1699013942,True,1,0,0.50205761194229126,0,True,False,False

First things first, I'm glad that Codemasters have managed to get the WRC license. The WRC Games by KT Racing were okay, but this blows it out of the water.
The physics are great, similar to 2.0 but cars are grippier and more planted and stable (take that as you will). But to me, they feel fantastic, definitely inspire more driving confidence than 2.0.
The graphics, to me, don't look as good on Unreal Engine than the Codemasters Engine. The game looks a little flatter than 2.0.
So far, the game is fantastic. But one issue, performance and optimization. The game tends to stutter a lot when loading into races for the first time, which may be distracting and throw you off rhythm.

It's incredibly fun, it never feels like you're driving something on rails like in Dirt Rally 2 despite the sim level settings.
There are actually some stutters here and there even with my PC but these are apparently shader issues, because once they've been on a track they disappear completely. So you have to go through it once.
I actually wanted to wait until VR was ready for the game, but after I was allowed to test the game on EA Play because of my Xboxgamepass, I had to have it right after the test.

To start out with, i got a 7900 XTX and a Ryzen 7 5800X3D
I'm not getting the performance i should out of this game, but there was some settings that helped big time:
Reflections, Mirror and crowd, the big killers of FPS in this game.
I went from 50-60fps on max settings 3440x1440p to 110-144fps with only those settings, which are not important at all.
There is some stutters, which is because the shader compilation is not where it should be either, but after a few times it should go away, with the 9 hours i got right now, i dont have anymore stutters.

Now for the positives:
- Stages are amazing compared to DR2.0, they are narrow, sometimes slow, sometimes fast, and they are a lot harder this time around, which for me is a big positive!
- Sound is just 11/10, not heard a bad sounding car yet, and can end up getting distracted by the sound!
- Game modes there is plenty of, mostly only done Career right now, which is giga too, around 8-10 hours just in Rally3, which is amazing, but you dont just drive the Rally3 car, there is other cars you can buy + invitational events, making sure you get to drive a lot of different cars!
Clubs are also great, having done one yesterday, giving you the chance to look it back after on the EA website, where you actually can compare lines and how you did against the others, a big positive towards this game for sure! (also works with Time Trail) 
- physics to me is a big step forward from Dirt Rally 2.0, while yes, it can be said there is a bit too much grip at times, it is fun, which for me is the most important. Dont come here and expect RBR. because its not, its more a Dirt Rally 3.0 with WRC license and way more content then Dirt Rally 2.0

Graphics i think is a bit of a mix bag, sometimes it looks a lot better then DR2.0, and other times the other way. 
dosent help that its not optimized either, but the developers are working on it, from their post.

To me, this is perfect, i have close to 100 hours in DR2.0, and was getting bored by the selections, even tho i love Wales and Scotland stages there.

Everything feels great, the handling of the car, physics and the force feedback.

The stages are a big upgrade aswell, there are lots of stages to drive in various locations and the design of the stages are now way more realistic. The road surface isn't a flat texture anymore there can be massive cracks, potholes, grooves and rocks that you will feel in your handling and force feedback. Also the track surfaces are different and feel different for example like soft gravel, hard gravel and so on, you will feel the difference in grip. Also the new longer stages will definitely test you, trying to survive 20+ minutes of pure focusing.

The list of cars are quite the same compared to DiRT Rally 2.0 but with couple more additions and the whole WRC1 class of cars. Different cars clearly feel different to drive, for example Gr. B cars really do feel like you are in a 80's car trying to just survive.

Now let's talk about performance and graphics. Without tweaking the setting on 2K resolution with RTX 2070 Super the game is a bit laggy and stutters a lot on high preset even the dlss turned on. All the stuttering and lagging dissapeared on medium settings and taking the anti-aliasing a notch down from epic to high made my fps go up a lot. The graphics itself ain't anything mind boggling but good enough. Not a bad looking game at all plus the long lasting dust clouds behind you are really cool looking.

So in a nutshell really good game with some performance issues that probably can and will be fixed eventually.

I actually expected this game to be stuttery on PC as it uses Unreal Engine 4 lol. 

I think the stutters are due to shader compilation and traversal (world loading) stutters.

While there might be a few day one issues, the overall experience is nothing short of exhilarating, making it one of the most enjoyable rally games I've ever had the pleasure of playing.

Gameplay (10/10):
I've always been a fan of rally racing, and WRC takes the excitement to a whole new level. What truly sets it apart is the incredible controller support. Whether you're using a gamepad or a steering wheel, the responsiveness and precision are impeccable. The sense of control you have over your vehicle as you navigate through winding forest tracks or tear down dirt roads is astonishing.

The career mode offers a variety of vehicles, each with its unique handling characteristics, and a progression system that keeps you coming back for more. The attention to detail in recreating real-world rally locations and the inclusion of the official WRC teams and drivers add authenticity and immersion that's second to none. The sense of accomplishment when you conquer a challenging stage or complete an entire rally is incredibly rewarding.

Graphics (10/10):
WRC is a visual feast for the eyes. The graphics are nothing short of stunning. The level of detail in the cars, the environments, and the dynamic weather effects is mind-blowing. Racing through rain-soaked tracks with mud splattering onto the windshield or under the scorching sun with the dust rising from the gravel roads is a sight to behold. The attention to detail in the car models and the various rally locations is truly praiseworthy. It's a game that showcases the power of modern gaming hardware.

Enjoyment (10/10):
This is where WRC truly shines. Despite a few day one issues (which are expected in most game launches), the sheer enjoyment this game provides overshadows any initial hiccups. The thrill of rallying, the adrenaline rush when sliding through corners, and the nail-biting moments as you avoid obstacles are what rally racing is all about. WRC captures these elements perfectly and delivers an experience that is pure joy from start to finish.

The inclusion of a robust multiplayer mode adds even more longevity to the game, allowing you to compete with friends and other players from around the world. The community is vibrant, and there's no shortage of rally enthusiasts to challenge your skills against.

In conclusion, WRC by EA might have had a few teething problems on day one, but it quickly proves itself as one of the most fun and immersive rally games to date. With flawless controller support, breathtaking graphics, and an unparalleled sense of enjoyment, it's a must-play for both rally enthusiasts and racing game fans alike.

The good: smooth gameplay, plenty of stages and cars out of the box and very responsive controls, decent car physics (sans tarmac grip).

The bad: very finicky with hardware, some games in the past hates multiple devices and it seems to be the case with this game as well, I have a separate handbrake that it refused to let me use while using my CSL Elite wheel and for some reason it wants to put my Xbox One controller ahead of all the hardware so I ended up unpairing it for the time being.  There's been a lot of reports of stuttering, it's expected when you first start the game since it's compiling shaders, it's been smooth for me however it also stutters/freezes occasionally when using my wheel (but none when using my Xbox controller).  I also experienced a couple crashes so far during stages.  And if you're having issues with blinding brightness/shimmering or such, look into tweaking engine.ini (you can find posts about it) and drop car reflections to ultra low.  One last thing, WRC Generations was plagued with the auto clutch (or throttle issue) that devs refused to address, and this game has an auto clutch too which causes the >50% throttle issue that WRC Gens has however it can be disabled but requires you to have transmission set to manual (semi-automatic sets clutch to auto).

I really enjoy the new career mode and building your car is something new - I hope they take these features and add them to the upcoming F1 games. 
WRC feels great on a PS5-Controller, although sometimes a bit too grippy; I feel like some cars should slide around a bit more. Tracks have a nice flow and give you that ""claustrophobic"" feeling at times - which adds to the nice sensation of speed.

Make sure to have the latest Nvidia Drivers installed, they specifically aim at improving this game's performance.

After 24 hours of play in early access, I can confirm that this game still has some issues. 
•  Graphical bugs
•  Stuttering (despite having a reasonably good system)
•  The UI and menus are more complex than they need to be
•  The livery studio is still lacking some features (e.g. numerical values, copy/save function, transfer decals to other side, group items, etc)
•  The force-feedback is lacking (especially on the tarmac)
•  The physics feel a bit ""cartoonish""
•  No support to export telemetry at this time, for SimHub, HaptiConnect, etc
•  No genuine multi-screen support - but we knew that was the case
•  Overall, the graphics (even on high) are sub-par 
•  The key-bind process is clunky - some actions cannot be un-bound or modified
•  When will racing ""simulator"" game developers just trust that we know how to start a car - depressing the clutch to start a car is not realistic.  We have cool button boxes to support the requisite key-binds for this.

The good points are:
•  It's kinda fun to drive - it's not very difficult
•  Even on pro-mode with hard-core damage and zero assists, the game is not totally challenging (DR2 is harder) - so it's super easy and fun to go flat-out and have fun
•  The builder system is kinda fun - who doesn't want to own and drive a Forde Minger?
•  It's got an RPG feel about it - you can really get into the ""story"" of being part of a WRC team
•  My wheel and peripherals didn't take too long to set up

I'm sure updates will fix some of the glaring issues.  The stuttering is very noticeable (for me) and has cost me dearly on some high speed maneuvers.

I don't really recommend this game at this time.  I'll play a bit more, but will probably still play DR2 as well.

To put it short, I could just copy&paste most of my old review, because this game suffers from same problems.

Things that piss me off here, is that instead of the promised AAA class WRC experience, it's just a cheap Dirt Rally 2.1 with a ""WRC"" stamp on it.

Each Rally event feels like you're driving the same stage all the time... BECAUSE YOU ARE. They modeled ONLY ONE stage per rally, which you drive back and forth in different lenghts. And they call different sections of the stage by a different name and label them as ""unique stages"". :D What a scam, the game gets repetitive after 30minutes. Somehow even the stages have been modeled in a way that they seem even more unnatural than in Kyloton's WRC title. Modded RBR stages look and feel a lot better than in either of the official WRC games. There is no WRC atmosphere at all in this game. WRC weekend usually starts on thursdays with a special stage or two. Then you move to forest loops, and end the rally with a power stage on Sunday. The rally event in this game is just one stage, back and forth, nine times. Are you serious, for real?

The computer stage times are super inconsistent. With a similar pace (AI set to 100%) I could be 20 seconds faster on some stage, and 20 seconds slower on another. Sometimes the AI is completely broken, I once won a rally because for some reason on the final stage I was 4 minutes faster than anyone else... Changing weather conditions don't affect
the AI times either, once I lost 2 minutes on one stage, because there was heavy snowfall and 0 visibility, but the computer times were like the conditions were perfect.

The career mode is kind of a senseless mess. Not only the UI is confusing, but it's just a porridge of random events with random cars. Seems that they try to make an illusion that there is a lot of content by doing this, hiding the fact that there isn't any content. Barely any WRC content at least. The way the rally weekends were built in Kyloton's WRC game was far from perfect, but even that was better done than this.

The co-driver's pacenotes leave a lot to wish for. They don't give out all the information of obstacles on the stage. Some kind of ""recce"" mode would be nice, where you could add your own calls to the existing pacenotes, if you want to warn yourself about some hazard. On the other hand, the sheer lack of unique stages means you learn the whole route in 15 minutes, which means you don't really even need pacenotes. It sucks, and takes away the feeling and spirit of rallying. This game is more like a hotlap platform for those who want to compete online, instead of a proper WRC experience.

The physics are, well, it is Dirt rally. No surprises here. No need for an analysis, there are much bigger problems than that.

I don't even bother to complain about the performance issues, they will probably be fixed. But the game itself will not be fixed. But it doesn't matter, only money does, right? When the target audience doesn't know better to demand more, trash like this sells. It is sad. Laser scanned stages and dynamic terrain physics should be an industry standard by now. The technology is there, and there are platforms that already use this (f.ex. iRacing). A rally game/sim would really benefit from dynamic terrain, because running order matters a lot.

Richard Burns Rally is still the superior rally platform after 20 years. I'm angry and upset that I fell for this scam and paid the full price for this. Take this review as a huge red flag before you make your decision.",1699006772,1699006989,False,4,2,0.452898591756820679,0,True,False,False

It's a solid 8/10 for me.

TlDr: it's a very good game. Endure the stutters for the first 20/30 minutes and, after that, it rewards your patience. 
But don't trust me, try it for an hour and if you don't like it, refund it. It's that easy.

Physics 9/10: IT IS NOT A SIM. It's a very good sim-cade, very similar to dirt rally 2.0. The physics are fun and realistic enough for me. Only complaint is that maybe the loss and gaining of traction is not as linear and progressive as it could be. It's to rapid imo and not as intuitive as the rest of the handling is. Also the game is very forgiving. But still very challenging. It's a nice balance, I think.

Sounds 9/10: interior sounds are out of this world. The best ever in a racing game, I think. I feel like I'm inside the car. Some cars don't have acurate sounds, like the fabia rs rally 2, but it still sounds very good.

Graphics 7/10: the graphics look fine. Nothing crazy. ""Next gen"" enough for me. Playing on ultra with reflections and mirrors off I'm getting fixed smooth 120fps at 1440p with a Rx 6800xt with fsr balanced. My only qualm is the brightness. Mexico is unplayable for me. I can't see the road, it's so blinding.

Stages: 9/10. Overall the stages are amazing. They look like the real thing, I recognise many roads from rally onboards. Some stages are a bit less than impressive, like the Croatia stages. Those were a bit disappointing, felt really unfinished. But still fun.

Co-drivers 6/10: the co-drivers could be better. The pacenotes are very good in my opinion, but the co-drivers voices are maybe to filtered. It's missing volume on the mid range, so you only hear high end frequencies. Because of that it's hard to hear them and I miss some calls from time to time. The female co-driver is better, but still miss some calls because I can't hear them.

Now, the stutters: for the first 15/20 minutes, there were some terrible stutters for me. After that, I get the occasional stutter every once in a while. Nothing crazy, doesn't make the game unplayable at all. The Devs have acknowledged the issue and said they have been working on it and will release a patch soon. So, at least they're working on it and telling us, unlike the teams working on the previous WRC games. I believe it will be fixed in the near future.",1699006722,1699006722,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

FPS schwanken enorm zwischen 30 und 70 auf hohen bis ultra Settings (34"" ultrawide 3440x1440, System: 5900x / 7900 xtx / 550er Board, 32 GB RAM)

Als ich gehört habe, dass die Unreal Engine genutzt wird, habe ich genau das befürchtet, was hier passiert ist. Gut optimiert kann die Unreal Engine funktionieren (wie bei ACC nach gefühlt 300 Updates). Das tut sie hier aber absolut nicht. Stages müssen ein zweites Mal hintereinander gefahren werden, damit nichts mehr ruckelt und stottert. Ich werde noch einige Updates abwarten, bis ich ins Spiel eintauchen kann. Es scheint sich um die bekannten Ruckler auf Grund der Shader zu handeln, die hier nachgeladen werden müssen bzw. vor der ersten Start einer Stage nicht geladen werden. 
WENN es läuft, erwartet einen ein Update zu Dirt Rally 2.0. In anderen Reviews habe ich gelesen, dass es ""sogar besser sei, als RBR."". Dem kann ich nicht zustimmen. Nicht, weil es besser oder schlechter ist, sondern weil RBR für mich eine Simulation ist, die eben nicht das größtmögliche Publikum erreichen will / wollte. RBR hat meiner Meinung nach eine viel realistischere Physik, als alle Dirt Rally Titel zusammen. In RBR muss man die nächsten Kurven behutsam planen - in Dirt Rally gab es nur Vollgas, bremsen, lenken, Vollgas. Und genau das sehe ich absolut nicht als Kritik von Dirt Rally oder dem neuen WRC game: Es läuft alles schneller als in RBR - was eben den Angstfaktor in DR / WRC ausmacht. Man hat ständig das Gefühl, das Auto am Limit zu fahren, aber irgendwann dann doch einen Baum zu erwischen, weil man es übertreibt, zu spät einlenkt oder eben doch mal die Ansage vom Copiloten falsch verstanden hat. Die Ansagen vom Copiloten finde ich übrigens weitaus genauer als in DR 2.0.

Positives:
- Stage Design ist weitaus besser als in allen DR Teilen davor. Es ist noch ausbaufähig, aber wirklich weitaus besser geworden. (RBR hat durch die ganzen Mods die Messlatte hier aber sehr hoch gelegt)
- Sounds sind weitaus besser geworden.
- Die Auswahl der Fahrzeuge ist genial. Ein oder zwei (z.B. Toyota Celica) würde ich noch gerne sehen.
- Physik macht ""Spaß""

Negatives:
- Performance
- Meine Pedale (Nuo Simulation) werden erkannt, müssen aber nach jedem Neustart neu kalibriert werden. Sie werden als Eingabe, nicht aber als Pedalerie erkannt. Auch, wenn ich sie als Pedale manuell kalibriere, speichert wrc das Profil nicht.
- UI absolut für Konsole optimiert (""Drücke Taste 2 um die Spielerprofile zu sehen"" - Ich habe aber ca. 50 Tasten am Rig und per Maus kann ich es nicht auswählen.)
- FFB im allgemein OK - außer bei einigen der alten Autos. Der Opel Kadett beispielsweise ist eine absolute Katastrophe, was das FFB angeht...

Firstly, they removed every mode except the Rally mode. This may initially seem like a bad thing, until you realise that in the previous games, there was always one mode that was under represented, and if they just focused on one mode, then they could pack that with more content than ever. That's what they finally did with EA Sports WRC.
Secondly, to make the game distinct, the length of the tracks are nuts. The average length of a short stage is around six minutes, the length of two entire stages in the old games, and the average for the long stages hovers around twenty minutes, which is what the lengths of entire RALLIES would be back then.
Thirdly, i love the physics. For me at least this is a really nice blend of simcade and DiRT Rally 2.0 where it still challenges the player, but still enough to make it actually fun to go back to.
Now, if i can address a couple of the really common problems people have with it, yes, the game visually is a downgrade from DR 2.0, but honestly when the hell has that ever mattered? Just because the game looks like a PS4 game doesn't mean that it looks bad, stop comparing it to other games that look phenomenal and holding them up as the standard. It's an unhealthy mindset to have.
Next is the stuttering, but that's literally only a problem for the first ten minutes of the game due to it having to compile the shaders, and then it's NEVER a problem again. I don't get why this is a make and break for so many people.
And finally, the bugs. Most of the bugs i've encountered are of the funny variety, things like the co-driver at the beginning forgetting to count down from 5, and then cramming all the numbers into the last second, that is hilarious. The only real bad bug i've found is a bug where the stage stops rendering every now and then. But there's a fix for this while it's still a bug, just pause your game for a second and it will load completely fine. It's really not that big of an issue.
So yeah if you couldn't tell, i really like this game. And as of me writing this (I'm not entirely sure of the future), the rating for the game right now is ""Mixed"" which if you ask me is criminal, people are really saying that this is as bad as F1 22. Really look at yourself and ASK if this game is even CLOSE to being the thing that killed the F1 franchise. Honestly this feels like the anti-EA game as there's no crazy microtransactions, barely any content blocked off by a paywall, tons of content in the base game, DLC coming down the line that the devs said are likely going to be FREE, and it's own unique thing to set itself apart from other rally games thanks to it's really long stages.

Please, don't let this game go down as another mediocre EA Sports game on their store page that will soon be forgotten, because it REALLY isn't that.

I can tell you first hand that nearly every sim out there is a self maintained play set where you have to make your own fun. This game is actually a finished product that you can open, play, and have fun in without hassle. This game is a direct improvement over Dirt Rally 2 in every way. The stages are infinitely more realistic, the handling is better, and the career mode actually attempts to simulate a career instead of just being a series of events that scale to whatever car you're driving. You will see people in these reviews comparing this game to Richard Burns Rally (RBR), telling you to save your money and play that instead. It's the ((true sim experience)) after all. The true sim experience means spending 2 hours setting up a 10-20 year old game to work with fan mods so you can run time trials over and over again on a program that feels like its barely functioning because it has marginally more realistic physics. I've done it and it's fun, but frankly rally isn't my main choice of motor sport, and I don't want to have to reconfigure wheel and game settings every time I want to do it. Neither does anyone who's new to this hobby, and anyone who hasn't already gotten past the several hundred dollar barrier to entry for a sim setup is going to be scared off by it. This is a sim that is also a video game. It has progression, challenges, pretty good tutorials, and engaging game play. To be completely honest I'm not particularly swayed by these claims that the game isn't realistic, because none of these people have ever driven these cars and this is much more in line with how I would expect them to perform. There's also videos of real rally drivers driving their cars in this game and saying the grip felt correct. Surely sim racers wouldn't argue with actual race car drivers about the characteristics of their cars. That's definitely never happened before right? That would just be absurd now wouldn't it. Now, talking about what the actual game is like, I'll start with the stages.

     I played a decent amount of Dirt Rally 2 (never got the chance to play previous WRC games), and pretty much immediately I realized that they would be the biggest selling point of this game. In the Dirt Rally games (which I will refer to as DR1 and DR2 from now on) the stages were a mish mash of existing real world locations with more exaggerated features, and the roads were also pretty wide. In this game, the locations are closer to their real world counter parts than you will get with pretty much any other game, and the roadways are also mostly 1 car wide, just like the real thing. The lengths of the tracks also match their real world counter parts, although you can select an option to run shorter versions of them if you don't want to spend 20 minutes on a stage. They're fast, they're technical, and they're exhilarating. I've seen some say that they are boring, but I disagree. I think if you could go fast on fictional tracks that were more technically intense due to being shorter, and you play a recreation of a real track and find it easy, you're probably just a better driver than you realize. I think it's a very common occurrence within the sim racing community to mistake difficulty for realism. Racing is hard, but making it harder doesn't automatically make it more realistic.

     Playing DR1 and 2 I rarely ever felt like my car was gripping the surface below me. It felt like I was constantly in a state of 100% wheelspin gliding over the track and guiding my car in the direction I wanted it to go in. This was especially bad on tarmac, it felt like driving over smooth ice. In this game the cars feel like they are really biting into the surface underneath, and its an absolute dream to play. Tarmac is downright addictive in this game, and hitting a well executed handbrake turn never gets old. Paired with the longer, more realistic stages this is the most intensely enjoyable rally experience I've ever had. Everything works out of the box and feels great. RBR had a better damage model and feels marginally more ""realistic"" I guess but the amount of effort it takes to keep it maintained and running isn't worth it to me for the amount of content it actually offers. In terms of wheel feel it's not as good as assetto corsa (nothing ever is), but it does the job and gets the message across well enough. Can't speak to controller as I haven't tried it yet. The actual physics model its self is very satisfying.

     If you've played either of the DR games you'll know that the careers are pretty bare bones. You'd buy a car, race it, earn money, upgrade or buy a new car, repeat infinitely. It worked but it got old quick. This game has a career mode much more akin to the F1 games (which I admittedly have not spent much time playing). When you start a career you can choose between Junior WRC, WRC2, and WRC. From there you sign with a benefactor that gives you a weekly budget for things like cars, engineers, and repairs. From there you complete tasks that raise your benefactors happiness level, which gives you higher budgets and lets you advance between the different levels of WRC. It's a great system that allows players at any skill level to get the experience they want while also getting rid of any kind of currency grind. There's no conventional money system so if you pick a car you don't like, you can just change it and the money comes out of the weekly budget. It's a great system, and I can easily see how it would be further fleshed out in future updates and future games. It can also be completely ignored if you wish. There's nothing pushing you towards it if you just want to do custom championships and time attacks.

     I'd also like to take a short moment to comment on the menus. In my sim racing career I have come to despise them. I put a lot of value in a game that I can open and be in a race within 5 minutes. It's a big reason why I always kind of preferred DR1 to DR2. DR2 had a lot of menu diving and load times, and none of the information was ever conveyed that clearly. I'm happy to say that this game is as good as it gets in this aspect. Within 5 button presses you can be in an event, which makes this game great for long career sessions as well as pick up and play. A highly underrated aspect of game design at the moment in my opinion.

     There's more I didn't touch on because I haven't really played with it yet. I haven't even opened the builder mode that allows you to create your own unique vehicles but it sounds neat. The moments mode sounds cool too, and I haven't looked at the online at all yet. There's a lot to do.

     In conclusion, if you want to play a sim that is also a video game, this is a good buy. It's 50 dollars (30 less than the new average retail price for a game), has a good amount of content, a great career mode, handles beautifully, and is an all round good time. This game is a step in the right direction for the genre, and I hope we see more games as good as this within the near future. It's been very dry for a very long time. I know within a year or two the sim crowd will come around to this for what it is. They're very stubborn and this being published by EA dictated a lot of peoples opinions before it ever even came out.

(P.S. I've seen the complaints about performance issues. On an RTX 3060ti and Ryzen 7 5700 with default settings the games never dropped below 60 for me. Hopefully whatever issues are there get patched out but I haven't been experiencing them.)",1698985390,1699002236,True,337,10,0.882858812808990479,0,True,False,False

First off: yes, it [i]does[/i] have shader stutter, and yes, there's (currently) stages that are [i]known[/i] to have bad optimisation (as per an EA post on this).  First patch is meant to fix most issues, but this would have been obvious in internal testing, therefore I'm leaving this here as a reminder that 'play early' means 'beta test'.  That said, I also suffered from inconsistent frame pacing - which disappeared once I turned v-sync off - and weird issues like while road lines appearing through what should be sight-blocking geometry, so there's obviously work still to be done on the game and that is disappointingly a trend for games released recently.

Handling-wise it's definitely an improvement over DR2.0.  Bear in mind I'm a wheel user (Fanatec DD, Thrustmaster Sparco shifter, Fanatec handbrake - all work great), so I don't know how it controls on a controller (get a wheel!) or a keyboard (repent sinner!).  Slidey stuff feels slidey, and tarmac now has slip where it should.  It's still not a simulation, but it definitely leans more in that direction.  I need to play a [i]bit[/i] more though; stages with mixed surfaces (say, Monty with dry tarmac leading into 'who the bloody hell buttered my tyres') don't feel gradual - it's very A/B ('ice from [i]this exact line[/i] here onwards'), unlike DR2.0 Monty where there were definite ice patches within grippy tarmac sections.  I definitely recommend you play with the force feedback settings though; I used TraxionGG's settings and it went from feeling okay to [i]chef's kiss[/i].

The massive stage selection is [i]very[/i] welcome (larger than DR2.0 [i]with DLC[/i] at launch) - but factor in the changes different seasons and position in the running order brings and it'll keep this game feeling fresh for a good while.  They're still not as 'pretty' as Kylotonn's, but real roads aren't.  I'm not sure where I actually stand on this - I [i]do[/i] want real roads, but Kylotonn's stages were a joy to drive through.  The stages do have more decoration than DR2.0 however, so perhaps it's a decent middle ground.

Audio design is excellent.  Given DR2.0, that shouldn't be a surprise.

I haven't tried Regulation Rally yet, but while I'm glad such a non-mainstream mode has been included and will be playing it, I can't quite work out why it's here.  WRC Promoter (well, its related companies) also look after Rallycross now, so bringing WRX through...makes sense?  And given that the pace-notes sound...not recorded on a per-stage basis as with previous games, why not put some work into something a good chunk of people might really love: a pace-note editor.  [i]Jesus wept,[/i] even on 'earliest', some pace-notes are far too late.  Like, announcing an incoming 'two left' when you're halfway around it too late...

If you're a ""I hate using a third-party launcher in addition to the one I'm already using"", [b]no: you do not (currently) need to use the EA App to launch this[/b].  If your Steam account isn't already bound to your EA account you may need to do this, but that's all.  Also, weirdly, RaceNet (for Clubs, etc.) isn't accessed through the game - you have to do it on the website...?!

None of these are game breaking, as it's mostly customization that I take issue with, the thing that was a major selling point of this game(in my opinion).

Car builder is an awesome feature, but could definitely use a bit more variety in terms of the car class types, since the current builder only applies to WRC Junior, WRC2, and WRC1 disciplines.  Not saying we need a Car Builder for EVERY Discipline, but for some that make more sense in a builder category like F2 Kit Cars. 

Livery Designer is WOEFULLY underappreciated as it currently stands.  Yeah we do get variety in shapes and some unlockables in the Rally Pass, but the logo options are all the bog standard ""sponsors"" you can apply, but not a single Real Life logo.  They're on the default liveries, why not have them as options for the editor?  As for the editor itself, there are STAPLE controls missing that were otherwise in previous EA racing Titles, like NFS Heat, NFS Unbound, and WRC Generations like Mirror, Copy/Paste, Indicated Scaling/Rotation, Custom Decal creation, LETTERS AND NUMBERS; all things that have been done before in the latest racing titles published by EA.

Driver Customization is kinda laughable in it's current state.  I see Racing suit designs from F1 with matching helmets, but NO color changing options.  This was a thing in your recent F1 titles, why leave that out?

Setting aside those points, I do have to say that the game plays very well and feels fantastic.  Where they fell flat in the customization side of things(compared to previous titles published.  And I am aware EA is the publisher and not the producer, but they do make decisions in some fashion), WRC makes up in gameplay, graphics, and sound design.  On the topic of sound design, THANK YOU for putting in music that's more than just some weird hipster trance tracks.

I spent over 100 hours with DR2.0 and booting up WRC felt like coming home. Physics are familiar but they are improved in every respect and force feedback on CSL DD feels way more detailed. 
As is tradition these days, you will hear people complain about the performance and every other aspect of this game from day one, but I had zero issues with performance, stuttering or setting up my wheel (playing on i5 13500 and RTX3070 in 1440p). Of course the loudest complainers are the sim crowd elitists with their triple screens, VR sets and expensive rigs, so basically like 1% of the playerbase, who cares what they think, especially since they are never happy with anything. You will also see plenty of critiques of the driving in this game from the same sim elitists, because of course they know how WRC car should drive better than people who actually drove rally car before and assisted in creating this game's physics. I would recommend anyone with a lick of sense to disregard these chronic complainers and enjoy this banger of a rally game, I feel it will only get better with time.
Back to the actual game and one of the biggest improvements over DR2.0: driving on tarmac finally feels good! Early on in the career I had an event that gave me Volkswagen Polo 2017 to drive in Mediterraneo and right off the start line I was floored at how face-meltingly fast this car felt and how fun it was on asphalt. You no longer feel as if you have no grip and are just floating over the tarmac like in DR2.0, I think they actually matched the great feel of earlier WRC games from KT Racing.
Gravel in DR2.0 was always the best surface to drive on and in WRC they managed to improve it even more. Its overall more detailed and less slippy, but I felt the biggest improvement when driving on wet gravel in Portugal. Instantly it felt very different from dry gravel and required I adjust my driving style, even in less powerful WRC Junior car.
Snow and ice are also improved and they don't feel as light and weightless as they used to. You feel like the studded tires are doing their work and biting into the slippery surface. Wet, sloshy snow feels expectedly slippery and requires a very different approach. 
Another hugely improved aspect are the stages themselves, compared to DR2.0 they are leagues better and more realistic as they are actually based on real life locations and thanks to the new engine they can be much longer than before. The longest stage is whooping 34.79 km long! This is a huge endurance test and a treat to any fan of rally sport. There are also some fictional locations, like Mediterraneo or Iberia, but they are inspired by real world locations and no less enjoyable than real stages. I actually thinks its a great idea to go beyond the locations present in current WRC season.
Cars themselves are rendered beautifully and sound just perfect. Each of them feel very different even when comparing vehicles of the same class, its a good idea to test drive all cars before making a choice. Car selection is surprisingly big, I didn't think there was so much more you could do when it comes to rally cars. Like, we all know the Lancia's and Audi's of old, but this the first time I'm seeing Hillman, Talbot or McRae R4. Overall, there are many more cars then we are used to seeing in rally games.
Overall I can wholeheartedly recommend EA SPORTS WRC to any fan of rally sport. For fans of real world WRC its a dream come true, with all its modes, car selection and even an option to build your own rally car! I haven't experienced any performance issues with the newest GPU drivers and half decent PC, so I'd say most of the complainers only have themselves to blame for their crappy PCs or outdated drivers. We can safely assume any technical issues will be ironed out in the coming weeks, which has become a sad norm in game developments these days. The game itself is everything a rally fan could hope for and a worthy successor to Dirt Rally 2.0. 
This will be THE rally game for the foreseeable future and whether we'll be getting new game every year or just paid expansion to this one remains to be seen, but based on this outing I'd say WRC license is in good hands with Codemasters and they already delivered so much more than Kylotonn ever did.",1699000015,1699000015,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Biggest problems ofcourse are the performance issues, i have quite beefy PC, i run it at 7680 x 1440 but i have to keep the graphics at medium / low and the game runs at 60-70 fps while honestly looking quite bad. And i dont really even care too much about the graphics in games. 
I usually run games without anti aliasing to make them look more sharp, but in this game the graphics makes you eyes almost hurt without it and anti aliasing makes the game look really smudgy. 
Dirt rally 2.0 for sure looked better than this game graphics wise and it ran at around 130 fps.

- Other big problem is that this game DOESN'T have TRIPLE SCREEN SUPPORT, really annoying since going a bit sideways is quite essential part of rally driving. you cant make out anything useful out of the side monitors when the perspective is all Fcked. I really hope they would add this at some point.

- The game also has some problems with wheelbases from some brands, such as Moza for example apparently. cant really comment what since i have fanatec base
Personally i havent had any problems with fanatec products in this game.

- FFB in this game feels kinda muted and quite easy to drive, i would like to see the wheel to be bit more alive.

- amazing physics. Unbelievable good and feels like a real car driving. Car reacts, is responsive for every turn, kick and physical interaction. Its a feel you have to feel, espcially with Simucube 2 pro wheel.
- very long tracks which feels even longer. 34km is the longest if Im not mistaken. Very detailed and realistically made. Even 8km track feels longer than in DR2.
- graphical lightning is very good. Gives realistic atmosphere.
- wheel feedback is very good
- sound is amazing, its honey for my ears
- car design is very good

Now negatives:

- very stuttering if settings are more than medium settings. I have RTX 3080Ti, should be able to run in high 3K resolution with ease but actually its unplayable. In medium settings I can play but still stuttering here and there sometimes. It means its badly optimized..

- Worse graphics than DR 2. Playing on High preset, everything looks bland, foggy, and very blurry. When driving fast, it might not be that noticable, but I can't really enjoy watching the replay now as it sometimes look like a PS3 game tbh.

Other than that, it's a fun rally game. If comparing Dirt rally 2.0 and this at launch, i would say that this is better because of the sheer content you got here compare to Dirt rally 2.0's very low selection of cars and stages in which you have to pay for dlc's to get more cars and stages. Mind you that WRC is probably going to have the same type of additional contents and probably with more aggresive pricing I'm a bit worried for these type of stuff in the long run but for someone who probably won't be going to touch the dlc's you're probably will have fun for the years to come playing this. 

The only thing i'm disappointed about this game is the livery maker. While a lot of people playing this game probably won't touch this feature, it is needed to be known on how abysmal the implementation is. There's no livery mirroring, lack of fine controls, low selection of stickers to use and other things. It is just frustrating that many racing games, no. Any game that has this feature will always have a ""bad"" livery maker. Out of all the games with a livery maker i played, only gran turismo 7 has the utmost best livery maker i have ever get hands on.

but a bit of warning to the people yet to buy the game. as of this review, the game is suffering from stutters. it can be mitigated by reducing some graphical settings. check back after they applied the fix if you're on the fence on your computer's performance.

Pros:
+ Detailed, varied, and hand-crafted track design - some of the best and most interesting tracks in any rally game
+ Number of tracks and activities
+ Physics and handling is very realistic and, most importantly, fun
+ Graphics are pretty good overall, especially on some tracks
+ Great career mode
+ Fantastic and brutal damage models (when enabled in settings)
+ Tons of replayability in Moments, multiplayer, clubs, etc.
+ Great control and force feedback / vibration
+ Good music, not your typical dude-bro stuff most racing games have
+ Good menus, settings, and overall feel of the game's presentation
+ Almost perfect balance of sim realism and video game fun

Cons:
- Some stuttering like others have mentioned. But for me it went away after playing a little while, with the new Nvidia drivers. I get almost 0 stutters now (not quite 0 though)
- The graphics on SOME stages are worse than previous games like DR. Most noticeable in thin and janky looking grass cover and some badly textured hillsides near the road
- They removed daily/weekly challenges, which is the main thing I played on most rally games after going through the career. The new Moments are good, but not good enough to be a complete replacement

Overall it's a great rally game, and all pros and cons considered, I already enjoy it more than I did Dirt Rally 1 or 2, and all of the many KT WRC games I've played.

This is hands down the best racing game i have ever played, the gameplay is excellent, every car feels different and unique requiring completely different driving styles to drive well, the driving feels great, i play the game on the medium difficulty so i have got some assists im not going full sim racer but it feels so satisfying to pull off a perfect turn or powerslide. Gravel, snow and asphalt stages all feel completely different and require you to play the game in completely different ways which is great, it surface is its own unique challenge with different strategies for each. I mentioned before but i do want to highlight just how different each class of car feels, every car feels different from each other and driving a WRC car is so completely different from driving say a JWRC car its insane and i love it, no car is a like and driving a audi quattro will feel completely different from driving say a yaris rally1 that you will feel almost like you are playing a different game. Also minor note but i love how customisable the difficulty is, you can change so much about the difficulty its unreal and i love it, i can personalise my gameplay experience to be just as challenging as i like, want harder ai but shorter events? go for it, easy ai and longer events? sure thing, want it to be just like real life? why not you absolute madman (looking forward to VR being added should be great!)

The career mode is also a highlight, i played some of the original dirt but found i lacked motivation to play since the only thing you got was more money for a different car but in WRC's career mode there is so much more, managing a team, picking your events and satisfying your investors is a really engaging way to keep players coming back wanting to continue to race since there's stuff to do that isnt racing which keeps the game feeling fresh. 

The customisation is pretty decent, building your car is fun but it does kind of wear off since you have got fairly limited options, designing the car livery suffers from the same problem of limited options especially when it comes to decals, im not sure how the licensing would work but there are no real brand logos in the livery editor which stinks, i for sure want to slap some pirelli logos or wolf lubricant logos on my cars but sadly cant since there are only fake logos from made up brands (they do look pretty cool though). I like the added female co driver option its a nice addition.

The graphics are where things kinda fall apart for me, they arent bad at all but they arent really good either, i play on high since for some reason ultra murders my fps and looks about the same, i feel like the game would benefit from some graphical touch ups cause currently it looks kind of cartoonish, especially the people they have a slight fortnite-y feel to them which is really offputting especially since they are supposed (i assume so) to look realistic. Its 2023 i really did expect a bit more but for what it is i can deal with it.

The only other criticism is the microtransactions, which by EA standards are actually really not too bad, my issue is the locking of content behind an ea play subscription, i dont mind losing out on cosmetics or shit like that but locking moments, which are like mini special rally missions, behind an EA play subscription is bullshit unless you will give everyone access eventually, that needs to be changed because i paid 60$ for this game and i reckon i deserve access to all the gameplay for that price, like i said i dont care about skins but keep the moments available to everyone. 

Another little touch i love is the use of real driver names and teams for the AI drivers, winning a rally against Kalle rovanpera and elfyn evans, rally drivers i watch on tv every month, is so much more fun and entertaining than beating John Q. AI and his co driver Brent or some shit.

All in All EA WRC is a really fun racing game that does not disappoint, it comes with plenty of cars and stages to enjoy as well as great gameplay to back it up, the graphics could use a boost and the customisation needs expanding but apart from that the game is absolutely awesome i cannot reccomend it more. Especially if you are a rally fan like me you will get an absolutely massive kick out of this game, ripping up the track in tommi makinen's evo or colin mcraes impreza will never not be awesome, and beating ott tanak and takamoto katsuta at rally japan is so awesome.",1698985764,1698987310,True,0,0,0.499150753021240234,0,True,False,False

There are a few other minor  issues but they don't impact gameplay and not enough for me to leave a negative review.

I'm currently using a TLCM Pedals with a Logitech G29 & Moza R5. 

The clutch has to be pressed at 100% in order for gears to shift which feels incredibly weird. The work around is to decrease the saturation on the pedal so the slightest touch to the clutch makes it go to 100% immediately, but this is dumb and defeats the purpose.

Moza and Sim Magic do not have official support although there are work arounds to getting these wheel bases working by adding a few lines into a XML file that existed in dirt rally 2.0. 

Depending on your cars transmission should be a direct relation with the activated control scheme. For example: if a car is a sequential car, then the only inputs that should work should be your sequential inputs, if the car is an H pattern car, then the car should only be using your H pattern inputs. This was an option in dirt rally 2.0 to have this behavior in game but it is sadly missing in this game. You can go into your settings and manually change your transmission type every time - but its very annoying to do and you will miss starts of races if playing multiplayer.

The career mode has been insanely fun so far as well as the weekly challenges or ""Moments"". The game does feel like an overall upgrade over dirt rally 2.0 and I have been very much enjoying my time with it so far.

Lowering my settings to a mixture of high / mediuim ) is giving me about 140-180 frames using a RTX 3080 and 12600k. I play ona 21x9 monitor at 3440x1440. Performance is honestly very reasonable for a brand new game in 2023. The main issue truly is the stuttering for the first few hours of the game, this is absolutely unacceptable as it makes the game quite literally unplayable and I sort of just pushed my way through it until it stopped, but I shouldn't have had to do this, there should be a shader building portion that every half decent game does to avoid this problem - I've seen many games using unreal engine 4 which pre-cache shaders on launch so its obviously possible.

-Too much grip and highly simplified car reactions make driving boring, especially on tarmac. this causes sudden weird loss of control, and i cannot do a power slide when in a tight corner. This ruined well designed tarmac stages. This is not the ""realistic"" that ea said in its promote videos and is not fun.

Replay:
-Roadside cam with an ultra-wide angle lens and fast-move behavior almost kills me. And heli cam involves too much. DR2 did this far more better than EA WRC.
-when my car crashes into something, the roadside cam will be forced to switch to onboard cam, this sucks.

-No ultra-wide screen perspective-correction
-no telemetry port

Pros:
-Manual clutch control is really good
-Stage design
-Dust particle

Every WRC license game was released with different weird problems(physics and rally experiences) and will not be well fixed, but stage designs are good. I blamed KT racing before, but for now, the same issues have appeared. So maybe the main problem comes from the FIA, not the game studios.

The frame rate is literally way too low for such a not-so-good graphics. To make it worse, there are frequent disgusting frame drops and lag, which is fatal for a racing game that requires quick reaction. Do need optimization before it's actually playable.

In terms of handling, I think it's much easier than DR2.0 because the car has loads of grip on the front axial in this game and is super responsive. You can just throw the car into the corner and the front end will just instantly follow your input. I just cannot feel any weight from the car. This is also reflected in collisions, especially in high-speed crashes, the car sometimes magically stops where it is right away and you don't have any feeling of the impact.

The handling on tarmac is also strange. It seems that this game swings to the opposite extreme compared to DR2.0. In DR2.0 the car could slide unexpectedly on tarmac while now it will just stick to the surface of the road. 

In conclusion, I will even not consider this game as an upgraded version of DR 2.0. This may be due to the fact that CM switch to the unreal engine, but from what they've got now, there's much to be improved.",1698985551,1698985804,False,11,0,0.539861023426055908,1,True,False,False

Other issues I've noticed are graphical ones, namely with the livery system where colors not assigned to my car are being stretched along the side of the car and my windows being blacked out even though I havent even touched window tinting. 

Some more minor notes are really just... level design for one. I understand that these are based off of real locations ver batim in most locations but honestly it just feels bland compared to Dirt Rally 2.0, on top of lighting issues and other minor things.

This definitely has the potential to be a great game, but it feels like yet another rushed EA product not spending enough time to be developed properly and being put out early to get quick cash.

First of all, abysmal performance. 
How on earth is it that this game looks worse than Dirt Rally 2.0 and also perform utterly bad? 
I'm getting between 50-60 fps @3440x1440 on high/ultra settings with no upscaling on an AMD 7900XTX and a R7 5800X with 32GB of RAM. This is not acceptable, also, we get the notorious traversal and shader compilation stutters provided by the lovely (sarcasm) Unreal Engine... Honestly I think the switch from the EGO engine to Unreal was a bad choice. It definitely feels that CodeMasters are noobs using this engine compared to their in-house one.

Second, I own a Moza R12 wheelbase, and I know that there can be some quirks here and there using this brand. However, DR2.0 already supported this wheel wonderfully. I was bummed to see that I had no FFB when I started playing...
What's my surprise? Oh well, you can actually copy some lines from device_list.xml file from DR 2.0 into device_list.xml on WRC and now FFB works... Like, seriously EA/CM? You only had to copy like 4 lines from a config file (not even a file that has to be compiled into the binaries of the game), and you couldn't do that during all these development years?

Also, DR 2.0 had a setting to automatically select H-Pattern or Sequential shifters depending on what the actual car is designed to have. For me that I have both kind of shifters on my rig, this was a godsend. However, now WRC, a 2023 game and supposed evolution from DR 2.0 doesn't have this, you are bound to use only sequential or H-Pattern regardless of what the car has. You want to use H-Pattern? Ok you have to select it manually in settings. Oh, you switched to a sequential car and want to use sequentual shifter, well, you can't unless you go again to settings and manually select sequential shifter. How can you go backwards in what seems to be a simple setting to implement? (Let's remember please, they already had it on the previous game).

Seems like I'm only bashing the game (I do it because I love the franchise and I want it to be good), but there are some positives:
- After FFB can be enabled (Not thanks to you CM), it feels really good, definitely a step up from DR 2.0
- Handling on both Tarmac and Gravel feels miles better than on DR 2.0
- Stage design is on par to the KT WRC games, which always had better stages than the Dirt series.
- Better carreer mode than DR 2.0
- Overall just a better game than Dirt Rally 2.0

Really Codies, fix the graphics, performance, lack of support for wheels and that little shifter setting and you have a gem of a game over here. But really I can't recommend it right now.

In its current state, I recommend getting Dirt Rally 2.0 instead.

In order to improve performance outside the bumper cam, set Car Reflections to Ultra Low and Mirrors to Off or Ultra Low. Putting Crowd on lower settings also helps.

Tarmac physics are vastly improved. Cars in general feel very good.

Everything is way to bright, with no real way to turn it down. Day stages in Winter are undrivable. Visuals in general look straight out of 2014 at some points.

A livery editor exists, but lacks basic features like mirroring from one side to the other or across the center of the car, doesn't allow you to copy/paste, and doesn't have text/ 
letters and numbers.

There is a Photomode, but it's kinda clunky.

There is no way to change colors on the preset suits and helmets, causing a mismatch even with most custom liveries. 
Single color (preferably licensed, i.e. Alpinestars or Sparco) race wear would be a huge quality of life improvement. 
Just give us a damn all black suit.

The car builder feature is a nice addition and should definitely be carried over to the F1 games in some form.

Also, the car builder Junior WRC car looks like it's supposed to be a Rally4 car instead.

You can't customize your co-driver's natinality for some reason, it is tied to the language. I know for the guys at Codemasters it might seem like a crazy concept, but not all English speakers are from the United Kingdom.

The 'campaign' mode is i would say the best we've ever had for a rally game managing your crew and expenses and much more. The track selection is amazing with so many locations and stages at launch and every single one of them feels unique and comes with their own set of challenges. 

The physics feels even better and more realistic than dirt 2.0 on gravel and snow, but the tarmac still feels a bit floaty, again much improved from dirt 2.0 but still needs a bit more work in my opinion.

The rally school in this game is a really nice touch especially for new players and teachers you everything you need to know to be competitively fast in this game.

Now onto the 'bad' things, the graphics are really good up to 2023 standards only downside is the mirrors are not very good nor do they feature ray tracing even though most people wouldn't use it, the option would've been nice. Performance is not very stable some races ill have upwards of 70-90 fps and in other locations especially around towns and complex areas I'll have around 30-45 fps, also doing things for the first time will cause massive stutters like crashing into a sign or splashing through water but then after it seems smooth.

Another thing missing is rally cross, I know that they dont have the RX licence anymore and want to focus all on WRC but still would've been nice to see and hopefully we'll see it added in the future.
