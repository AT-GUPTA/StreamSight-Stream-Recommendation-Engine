The game looks absolutely stunning! The pixel art is beautifully detailed, and the environments are dripping with atmospheric goodness. The smooth gameplay is a real highlight; the controls are tight, and combat feels satisfyingly impactful. And let's not forget that OST – it's a masterpiece. The haunting melodies really set the tone for this dark, twisted world.

Now, onto the not-so-great parts. The bosses – I mean, seriously? They could have cranked up the difficulty a notch. I was expecting more of a challenge, but most of them felt a bit too easy to defeat. A little more complexity and variety in their attack patterns would have been welcome.

And can we talk about those instakill spikes everywhere? I get it, the game wants to be challenging, but sometimes it just feels unfair. I found myself more frustrated by unexpected deaths from spikes than by actual enemies. A bit less of that wouldn't hurt.

Another gripe is the lack of quick travel options. Come on, in a game where backtracking is part of the deal, a quick travel system is almost a necessity. It gets a bit tedious having to traverse the entire map repeatedly, especially when you just want to explore different areas.

Despite these issues, Blasphemous does have its charm. If you can look past the frustration of spikes and wish for tougher bosses, there's a beautifully crafted game with a captivating atmosphere waiting for you. It might not be perfect, but it's worth a playthrough, especially for those who appreciate a visually stunning and smoothly playing experience.",1708889730,1708889730,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is a proper horror at the same time, as it is gruesome and cruel when it comes to the fates of its denizens in this game.

After beating this game on NG+ with unwavering faith and getting the true ending, I think my block button is broken. No, I'm wrong, its my finger, never mind. In any-case, this is for me personally the best 2D side scroller game I have ever played. For horror that is, not going to drag Mario into all this.

Some enemies and attacks you can parry, some you cannot. Sometimes an enemy can be dodged through, other times the same enemy cannot. Some pits are bottomless while some require you to drop down to progress. You're literally flipping a coin first to see whether you're jumping into a pit of death, and some spikes are instant kills while some are not. Sometimes you are able to grab onto a ladder in poison fog, sometimes it doesn't register. 

Even after the major patch and expansion that attempted to address major issues with the game, stun, heal and attack animations continue to lock you in while enemies big and small barely flinch to your assaults. Magic is therefore still moderately useless, as is parrying because they all lock you into vulnerable frames with inconsistent benefits. Even healing yourself is dangerous because you're vulnerable and stationary for many, many frames.

There's no visual cues to let you clue in when any of these mechanics are meant to be used and when not to. Rather than feeling natural, the game is full of artificial difficulty, which is infuriating.",1604738190,1708805564,False,1,1,0.4887218177318573,0,True,False,False

The art style is beautiful, and the combat is fun, but there are some questionable design choices. Namely the ladders are extremely annoying and I often ended up accidentally grabbing them when I was trying to attack upwards, while I failed to grab them when I was actually trying to. There are also a few bosses that can just chain hit you until you die, but that didn't bother me much because it felt like part of the challenge. Certainly takes a lot of inspiration from [i]Hollow Knight[/i]; runes, arena, respawn points, secrets/collection style etc. The world is really large and I was excited that the map kept getting bigger even when it felt like I was approaching the game's ending. Genuinely had a lot of fun, but some of the enemy designs require a lot of patience to take down properly, and the game doesn't give much direction in terms of unlocking new abilities. It's also a pretty short experience– I beat the main story in about 8 hours of gameplay, then spent about 5-6 more getting my file to 100% completion and unlocking another ending. [i]Blasphemous[/i] is good, but the few poor design choices stand out and hurt it a bit. Though artistically it's amazing, and I enjoyed my time with it.

The pixel art is amazing, the over-world is breathtaking, and of course the executions are just flat out beautiful to watch. I do however have three main issues with the game. 

  Number one, I don't like how you have to spend precious tears to unlock fast travel between shrines. I know there are fast travel points, but I feel they should have just stuck with shrine travel in general. 

  Number two is how upgrading flasks work. You have to sacrifice a flask charge in order to make healing stronger. There's ten in total, but upgrading to the max only gives you 5 in the end. I just think that's plain dumb, you shouldn't have to lose flasks to upgrade your healing. 

  Number three is side missions. there are a few missions in the game where if you progress to far in the story you'll miss out on gaining really useful items. None of them are even related to bosses so I don't know why it would matter when I do a mission. 

  Overall I do think this game is well worth the money if you like a good challenge. Since honestly, when it comes to souls-like games. This is one of the better ones out there. 8/10",1708309449,1708402399,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is simply lackluster game design as I had no idea of the order I was supposed to follow in order to get a very good weapon buff (+25% damage) and unlock the 3rd ending.

This game is actually incredible. 
- Parry is satisfying. This alone makes the combat fun. Another proof that EVERY game should have parrying.
- Boss fights are fair and challenging with decent variety. 
- World design is pretty good with bunch of shortcuts and intuitive hidden secrets. Still, maybe cause I'm not a huge fan of metroidvania in general, fast travel should be available by default instead of being gated by some obscure donation event. Backtracking is tedious and anti-fun.

With its haunting visuals, precise combat mechanics, and deep lore, Blasphemous offers an unforgettable experience that beckons players to return time and time again.

Visually, Blasphemous is a dark and atmospheric marvel. The handcrafted pixel art style creates a nightmarish realm filled with grotesque creatures, haunting landscapes, and stunningly detailed animations. Every frame is dripping with macabre beauty, evoking a sense of unease and awe. The attention to detail is remarkable, immersing players in a world that feels both hauntingly familiar and utterly unique.

The gameplay of Blasphemous is challenging but deeply satisfying. As the Penitent One, players engage in precise and skill-based combat, mastering a variety of weapons and abilities to overcome the horrors that lurk in Cvstodia. The combat mechanics are tight and responsive, rewarding well-timed parries, dodges, and devastating counterattacks. Each encounter demands focus and strategy, making victories feel hard-earned and exhilarating.

What sets Blasphemous apart is its rich and enigmatic lore. The game's narrative is intricately woven into every aspect of its design, from the haunting environments to the cryptic item descriptions. Exploring the interconnected world of Cvstodia reveals fragments of a dark and tragic history, inviting players to piece together the truth behind the land's religious fervor and suffering. The lore is deep, engaging, and leaves players hungry for more.

Replayability is where Blasphemous truly shines. The game offers multiple paths, secret areas, and hidden collectibles, ensuring that each playthrough unveils new discoveries. The interconnected nature of the world encourages exploration, as backtracking to previously inaccessible areas with newfound abilities reveals hidden secrets and alternate routes. The sheer amount of content and the desire to uncover every hidden secret make Blasphemous a game worth revisiting.

Furthermore, Blasphemous provides additional replay value through its New Game Plus mode. After completing the game, players can start a new playthrough with their upgraded abilities and equipment, facing even greater challenges and uncovering additional story elements. This mode adds a layer of depth and longevity to the experience, enticing players to test their skills and unravel the mysteries of Cvstodia once more.

However, it's worth noting that Blasphemous may not appeal to everyone. Its difficulty level can be punishing, demanding precise execution and patience. Some players may find the steep learning curve frustrating, but for those willing to persevere, the sense of accomplishment is immensely gratifying.

In conclusion, Blasphemous is a dark and atmospheric masterpiece that combines haunting visuals, challenging gameplay, and a captivating narrative. Its intricate lore and interconnected world draw players into a realm of religious anguish and macabre beauty. With its high level of replayability and New Game Plus mode, Blasphemous offers an experience that keeps players coming back for more, uncovering new secrets with each playthrough. It is a must-play for fans of atmospheric action-platformers seeking a deeply immersive and rewarding journey into darkness.",1707265800,1707265800,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I personally enjoyed it and would recommend it to people who have played souls-like games or metroidvania games like Hollow Knight or Dead Cells, or any other metroidvania game out there.

It has a dark and atmospheric world, with amazing and detailed pixel art. The challenging combat, combined with platforming sections and boss battles, is a highlight. The game draws heavy inspiration from Christianity and Spanish folklore, and while I'm not a Christian, the deep-rooted religious themes might be off-putting to some players. The grotesque elements, though fitting the dark atmosphere, can be intense.

Exploration in this game was really confusing at times, but also very satisfying to explore the map. The soundtrack was alright, I didn't really care much about it. During gameplay, I am more focused on finding the next boss, relic, or loot.

I rate this game 8/10. It was fun, however, it is not without its flaws. For example, it was very confusing to figure out what to do, the map is just so big, there are things not explained to you, and finding certain items can significantly impact exploration or boss battles.

The questing is really confusing, you don't know how or when you are supposed to progress each quest. You don't even know how many items you need to collect, and the absence of a journal in the game is a bummer because questing would have been more efficient.",1707075624,1707075624,True,5,0,0.558823525905609131,0,True,False,False

The gameplay is very challenging, even right from the start, as the game gives you only it's basic tools for you to master: parrying, dodging, aerial attacks, combos...
The progression system is focused on exploration. Don't worry, a basic amount of exploration is needed to play through the game for the first time, but the more you explore the easier it gets... until you realize that the game offers you enough possibilities to properly challenge yourself even with your new upgrades.

What I always didn't like about some other games of the genre is the amount of time used to find ""the next major main part"" but this game doesn't have that problem. The map is digestable enough so that you always know what you didn't explore and the map layout doesn't require much effort to travel to many areas more than you want, which is amazing. I also unlocked like 95% of everything without looking up a guide, but the remaining amount is something completionists will still enjoy as a tough challenge.

The combat is tight and satisfying and it gets enhanced with more possibilities the longer you play. There are some insane builds you can pickup (again based on exploration) along the way. And parrying bosses in this game feels so amazing.

The story and world is a deep dive. At first, everything seems just weird, gory and occult but you will learn to love it eventually. Every item has a huge paragraph  that tells you a little more about the story of the game, but you can also just sit back and take in the environment without reading it all, and it's still good due to the presentation. And the presentation of this game is one of the best aspects! It's a weird blender between 2d and 3d combined with a renaissance-like stylization and is perfect to transfer the medium.

And everything I told you about scales very well, you can have as much as you want in this game. Every person I know that played this game has at least played through it twice, likely even more, made possibility by the depth and satisfaction of everything.

I had some minor bugs when I played it but nothing really awful.

Initially I tried this free on amazon games and I wasn't really feeling it. Then it went on a big steam sale and I wanted a title to play on my Steam Deck. This game fit the bill. The platforming, combat, and everything is really smooth and satisfying.

I would say my main gripes is that we don't get a new weapon at all. We do get some new abilities and spells, but we spend a majority of our time swinging our sword. Apparently in the sequel you can use different weapons which is exciting.

Besides that, the exploration is fairly rewarding and fun. The traversal mechanics give the results you'd expect but are very different than just your normal double jump. Boss fights are all pretty fun and get much better once your sword gets stronger. The first 2 fights it feels like you're slapping pretty weak but it changes over time. Some quests and item drops are a little abstract so you might hit up a guide here and there to make sure you aren't missing something.",1706622797,1706622797,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A estas alturas estoy seguro de que, si me permitieran elegir un solo género o subgénero de video-juegos, lo mas probable es que ""Metroidvania"" sería la respuesta. Y Aquí es donde comienzo con el gran Blasphemous. 

Este juego desarrollado por un estudio español, toma a manos llenas los elementos que hacen grande a un Metroidvania. Entonces, ¿Qué es lo interesante? ¿Por que tanto Hype? ¿En serio requería de una secuela?

Si bien no termina de renovar ni reinventar el género, es notable su increíble apartado gráfico. Ese mundo que crearon los de ""The Game Kitchen"" es sumamente bello. También es único. Finalmente, es horroroso lo que sucede en él, y el viaje al que nos lleva.

Tomamos el control de ""El penitente"" un guerrero silencioso cuya misión es especificada al inicio del juego. Sin embargo el reto que conlleva es mas difícil de lograr que lo esperado. Los personajes que aparecen ante el protagonista (ya sea para ayudarle, o intentar detenerle), están animados de una manera que se siente orgánica en ese lugar.  En serio, solo apreciar lo que está sucediendo en el mundo y sus alrededores vale la pena.

A esto se le suma un increíble soundtrack que fue hecho a la medida para cada zona, enfrentamiento contra jefe, lugar seguro, menús, etc.

Y hablando del ""pequeño"" detalle de los jefes, Blasphemous si que sabe lo que hace. Luchas brutales, victorias pírricas y probablemente muchas derrotas nos esperan a la hora de medirnos contra estos seres, que tienen mecánicas tan particulares y animaciones tan bien hechas que, simplemente son todo un viaje por si solos.

Los diálogos son impresionantes y este es uno de los pocos juegos que recomiendo jugar en Español de España. La narrativa podría no ser la mas extensa y el Lore es un tanto confuso. Si no estamos familiarizados con ciertas referencias católicas es posible que de entrada se sienta raro. Sin embargo conforme te dejas envolver y absorber por el mundo de Cvstodia y su fervor enfermizo, vas comprendiendo que es lo que sucedió y por qué es necesario llegar hasta el final.

Es un juego difícil. Muchos dicen que no se compara con Hollow Knight en este apartado. Sin embargo, subestimar a tus enemigos es un gran error. Pero no hay por qué preocuparse. Ellos estarán contentos de recordarnos eso. Por lo tanto, hay que volverse mas fuerte, y este es otro de los puntos fuertes del juego. Tenemos a nuestra disposición una enorme variedad de poderes, accesorios y técnicas que (por supuesto que las pagamos con fervor) nos ayudaran durante nuestra penitencia.

No hay tantos juegos de un solo jugador a los que le dedique tantas horas. Pero este si se lo merece. Altamente recomendable. Buen valor de re-jugabilidad y mas de un final por desbloquear.

Pros: [list]
[*]Unique, grotesque, excellent art and designs 
[*]Great music and sound
[*] Good, but not excellent, combat gameplay. 
[*]Character and vibe 
[*] Manageable play time for a first game, with the option to NG+ if you're into that. 
[*] Excellent on Steam Deck.
[/list]
Cons: [list]
[*]Finicky platforming combined with instant death spikes and pits. Would often miss a platform for no clear reason, and I felt that some hazards that alternated between foreground and background were easy to misread (the bells in Mother of Mothers). 
[*]I found the balance quite bad - the only boss I really struggled with was Lady of the Charred Visage who I felt was very random. Every other boss I was able to defeat in 1-2 tries, especially after unlocking [spoiler] the spell Debla and the two +100% spell damage items [/spoiler]. That combination trivialized the bosses in the second half of the game. 
[*] In general, too many spells. No reason or easy way to switch between them in combat. 
[*] Sword arts in general were either incredible (dash strike), niche (ranged attack), or useless (charge attack, downstrike)
[*] While the world building was interesting and vibey, the actual plot and directions I found very opaque. Side quests particularly I needed a guide. 
[*] The bone collectibles were meh.

This is a great Metroidvania with great progression, a beautiful art style, and mysterious story telling. 

There's a lot of content here, even when you complete your first run there's more to experience after. The game offers a good amount of challenge but there are really challenging options available if you're looking for something more difficult. 

I played Blasphemous 2 straight after this and having completed that game at nearly 100% (currently sitting at 97% completion banging my head against a wall) I personally think that Blasphemous 1 is a stronger and more enjoyable product.

There are plenty of reasons but mainly B1 feels more mysterious and less linear. B1 also has years worth of extra content whereas at the time of writing, B2 is still a recent release and has no extra content beyond the core game, so it might be worth waiting until there's more if that bothers you. 

Whilst B2 was a great experience, I think B1 is better and I am still tempted to come back and further explore the game.",1706486552,1706486552,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I genuinely wanted to love this game, but it just didn't do it for me. The team that worked on it is obviously very talented, especially in the art department. This game's sprite work is gorgeous and it's aesthetic is inspired. Exploration was good and the game didn't run me ragged with content like Hollow Knight did. But the gameplay was extremely disappointing on several fronts.

1. The parry sucks. It is fine against normal enemies but against most bosses there is little advantage to using it over dodging or jumping. You will be pushed back out range to do a retribution attack or even a regular one. This is despite the fact that parrying attacks requires slightly more skill and planning than jumping over or dodging attacks. 
2. Movement speed is too slow. The penitent one trudges along slowly for most of the game this makes platforming, which there is a considerable amount of in this game, a chore. That is unless you get an optional  rosary bead that increases your speed, at which point movement starts to feel like a dream. 
3. Many of the bosses are mid, especially in the early games. In the later game there are a lot more competently designed fights but I was left with a bad taste in my mouth compared to Hollow Knight's or SotN.
4. The level design is mean spirited at times. I get this game is about ""suffering"" but I can't tell you how many times I jumped to a platform only for an enemy who was previously off screen hit me we with a projectile that sent me flying back into a spike pit or back down the ground causing needless tedium and repetition.

I am not a fan of old school Castlevania games though, only SC4, SOTN and AoS so a lot of my gripes probably ring hollow to fans of the original trilogy. 

I am glad this game did well and I hope improvements have been made in Blasphemous 2.

I'm not too sure what is going on in the story that much or who the pentint one is, nor did I even know that the game's style was influenced by roman Catholicism when I bought it. I know that the miracle did alot to Cvstodia.

It was a trip and it was quite hard to beat. 

The one thing that's really frustrating about this game is that its a pixel-perfect platformer where you have to time and HOLD your jumps just to get across a gap. Sometimes I would also land on a platform over spikes and then phase right through it which is a bit odd.

But a pretty cool game nonetheless. 

The time trials where so hard though and I really wish they added an achievement for completing them in this game.

----------------------------------------------
Also if you want the good ending be sure to:

*Get the immaculate bead
*Die 3 times with the bead equipped (Keep this equipped)
*Destroy all those guilt recovery statues and do the dungeons for each one
*Go along and beat the game normally

Apart from that, it's ok I guess, a pretty average battle-focused metroidvania. I'm not sure it was good enough to warrant buying the sequel, but it's not out of the question at least.
The art and atmosphere are nice. I couldn't get it in me to care about the actual story after the first two hours. Stopped reading the lore dumps in the item descriptions around the same time. 
The platforming clearly isn't a major focus here so it's barely worth mentioning really. It is a bit approximative and buggy, but thankfully it's only very rarely challenging, so you don't notice it much. Combat is ok. Both bosses and normal enemies are quite well-designed and can't be fought efficiently by just mashing the attack button. You'll have to jump, roll and parry. 
The difficulty is adequate. I'd say I died about once per boss and per zone. It's enough to feel somewhat challenging without getting frustrating. After beating the game once you unlock four different NG+, each with slightly different mechanics. Two in particular are tweaked to force you to use magic instead of your sword. I think it's a nice way to add some replayability to the game. I enjoyed doing that magic-only run after basically ignoring this whole aspect of the game during the first one.

Of note, the game has a bad habit of trying to waste your time. Dialogues before bosses that keep getting repeated everytime, that platform that you need to wait on for a whole minute doing mostly nothing during one of the few platforming challenges of the game, the fast travel being locked behind the donation box...

I went for ending C which requires you to beat 2 new bosses and it adds 2 phases to existing bosses.

The game wants to be like Dark Souls in that bosses are epic and challenging, It ends up just implementing annoying gimmicks that you'll have to repeat constantly.

I played this game hoping that the bosses would be worth the pain of the levels. Every main game boss is too easy. The Wounds of Eventide bosses are actually challenging, its just disappointing that its only 2 of them.

The art/aesthetic of this game is its saving grace, The final bosses are jokes, you'll get sick of running through the same area, idk why the Prie Dieus fast travel is locked behind 20k tears.

The gameplay doesnt feel as ""fluid"" because it doesnt have mechanics as down direction attack, double jump, air dashs...

Update 01
They have fixed it and made movement better and not as buggy. They also made the main character faster which is good. You would to play it when the game came out just to know what I talking about movement. It felt a slow just little. But over all it is better and great amount of fun

Change from C- Rank to A+ Rank.

Update 02
Never let the stupid idiots to make challenges of jumping ever again. The developers are wanting to be a hollow knight ripe off with the damn jumping around and bouncing on objects by hitting it. But have no idea how terrible they are with the dlc where ""New Levels"" that for fuck sake are no where near as good as hollow knight or Mega Man Zero. I keep dying a lot. That's fine if it's hollow knight or Mega Man Zero because the characters your play as the those games, even the Mega Man X and Zero have characters that are fast and easy to control. Here however I can't with the guy. He is NOT design the same way for jumping challenges HE IS TOO DAMN STIFF AND SLOW. They have the right idea that fits the slow jumping puzzles and boss fights they do that great it's fun. But not the Jumping challenges. 

In short. NEVER MAKE ANOTHER GAME OF JUMPING CHALLENGES WITH A CHARACTER THAT IS SLOW AND STIFF. This is a great game. But what the fuck is wrong with you guys making these jumping challenges. It would be fine if there were no time limit but I guess you guys that it would be too easy. Well maybe that true or maybe you should use this idea on more faster characters that are design for this. Even crash bandicoot remake did not have this much trouble. He is fast but not fast enough for this.

Although he was immortalized as one of the post-renaissance masters, the Primer Pintor de Camara’s life was anything but happy. It’s almost certain that the tragic death of his children and the turmoil of his country inspired the nightmarish works of his late career. Combine this with his relationship with Catholicism and you have the principal inspiration for Blasphemous.

Blasphemous is not a classical Metroidvania a la Symphony of the Night, and it’s not quite a Souls-like. To define it: it is a hack’n slash platformer with strong presentation. While the combat is rather simple, the visual design is anything but. The world of Cvstodia features some of the finest pixel art in the industry, ranging from grand cathedrals to grotesque abominations. Enemy variety is great and boss designs are reminiscent of the finest from series like Dark Souls. Complimenting this is strong world building and a macabre story dripping with religious symbolism. For el amor de Dios, please play in Spanish with subtitles on.

Not all works are blemish-free. Blasphemous' difficulty curve is bumpy, loot is unexciting, and magic is overtuned. There are also a few bugs, including Guilt Fragments in unreachable areas and the player getting stuck but they are rare. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2934161524 

Like Goya’s works, Blasphemous is uniquely beautiful and disturbing, and while it does not reach the lofty heights of the painter’s career, it is certainly worthwhile.",1678703656,1705881954,True,46,0,0.802279472351074219,0,True,False,False

The game is just insanely easy, most boss fight revolving spamming a health sponge boss which stand still, barely move or teleport. Most boss deal so little damage you can just face tank them, The healing is also instance so you do not need to care about timing at all. 

Normal mob can't pass each other so you end up all way fight mob 1 on 1. Most mob post little to no threat at all because of this. There is one particular mob that have insane amount of heal, stand still, you can not pass if not kill it, spawn projectile which deal insane amount of damage and really hard to dodge. You will end up hit it one time, run far away, go back and repeat. 

Idk why game nowadays just love to add the parry mechanic in when they don't even understand why it work in others game. All mob in this game do 1 time slow attack which is really easy to parry. The active frame of the parry also last for like half a second, so it is too easy to pull off. Mob encounter become boring as hell.

It can't be worse right? Nah it can, you also have a dash attack ability which reach insanely far, deal like 5 time normal attack, have no consequence of using. Fight now become: run away, use dash attack, repeat. I legit forgot the parry mechanic even exist. 

The movement and attack are also feel off, it is just not ""tight"". Idk, if you play many 2d platformer you will know this feeling.

Lever design is ok. I like how region connect to each other. I do not like how they hide key mechanic behind confusing dialogue.

Most equippable are useless. Most sword skill also useless. Most skill you equip on your sword also useless, except for the very first one you get.

The lore feel pretentious. This maybe a me thing though.

I originally bought this game a while back for Steam, but it wasn’t until I picked up the game along with its sequel on disc for the Xbox that I thought I would really give it a go, and I’m so glad I did because it is great.

The game has some stunning Spanish-themed artwork, which I would go as far as to say is the star of the show. Ok, I might be overstating it just a little, but it is truly brilliant artwork. The real star is the brilliant combat system; there is nothing more satisfying than performing a well-timed block, then doing an execution afterwards. 

I think for me, I can find some Metroidvania games a bit difficult. I like to chill, take my time, and just have fun. If the boss fights are too hard, I’m not coming back to play again. But I found I’m a lot better at these types of games than I had previously thought. I would say Blasphemous can be more frustrating than difficult. I think if you get your timing right and learn the enemies' patterns, you will progress through the game; this, for me, was all part of the fun. I would recommend anyone to check it out.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

That said, it was through Blasphemous that I found out I'm more of a fan of the lush art style than I am the gameplay. I don't shy away from difficult games, I've enjoyed and completed Dark Souls, Cuphead, Hollow Knight, and am always looking for similarly difficult games, but never quite got the same kick out of Blasphemous. The game is much more linear (at least in it's early-mid game, I left off at the 18th level/area, [spoiler] the archcathedral ramparts [/spoiler] ) and has a VERY slow beginning. I'm glad I didn't quit then, because once I got a few more upgrades the game loosened up a little and was a somewhat fun challenge. The boss fights and the attention to detail in the art were my biggest incentives to push through the constant death and backtracking through difficult enemies and areas. At a certain point, the multiple times at which I realized I wasn't enjoying myself took over and I've decided to put the game down for now.

I want to emphasize this was my personal experience with Blasphemous, and my level of enjoyment was not reflective of how well made this game really is. It may have been punishing, but the love invested into Blasphemous shines through every aspect of its design. The menus, backgrounds, characters, and effects all are styled with a fantasy Spanish Gothic flair that makes the look and feel of the game REALLY stand out in the best way possible. Another thing I really appreciated having just finished Jedi: Fallen Order is that it was immediately refreshing to have a set of controls that operated responsively and with precision!

Overall, I don't want to give this game a rating because I don't feel like I've gotten the full experience-- the game is objectively well made but my time playing it was mixed emotionally. I always felt like it was just about to click with me but after the better part of ten hours I just think it isn't for me.

This is where the review was going to end but out of curiosity I looked up how far I got into the game. As it turns out, the 18th area is one of the final areas in the game, and I was beating it at a pretty steady pace. Now that I know that I've seen most of what the game has to offer, I can say confidently that everything else I wrote here holds water for at least a majority of the game. 

I still recommend to anyone enticed by the art style, fans of Castlevania, or those diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and paranoia due to their deeply ingrained religious guilt. An objectively-well-made-game-that-didn't-quite-click-for-me/10.",1705026905,1705026905,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In a word: brilliant.

Not since watching Kevin Smith's ""Dogma"" have I beheld such a clear, poetic, and powerful observation of, and commentary about, Christianity in the modern era, specifically Catholicism. The world of Cvstodia is a fully rendered fever dream of Purgatory well-realized in a bleak, bloody fantasy space that closely mirrors certain periods of feudal Europe.

The cup of ""Blasphemous"" runneth over with metaphors: guilt is the game mechanic built around punishing the player for death, because it's a memory of our mistakes; the Penitent One can lose health to gain fervor (the means by which a player can power 'prayers', which are the games spell-effects), because paying in blood is how one demonstrates dedication to the cause; players are largely free to choose their own path through the game, because the workings of the Miracle are inscrutable and unique to each person. Those examples are but a fraction of the ways ""Blaspemous"" explores and in many cases deconstructs the faith it examines. With only the most superficial of understandings regarding the source material, you'll appreciate a great many of the articles. For those more versed in the mythology and practices of the Church of Rome, though... It's quite a feast. Delicious, even.  

You don't need to be religious to enjoy the game, though you may be inspired to a religious fervor once you're a few hours into it. Between the excellent platforming, beautiful art, inspired soundtrack, and Souls-like combat, you might touch upon the sublime during your journey with the Penitent One. But don't take my word for it. Each persons penance is as unique as the sins for which they are born; each persons guilt shapes each persons world. Experience the Miracle in all its grandeur and all its glory; to know its grotesque blessing is to know a path toward absolution.

Recommended for: metroidvania aficionados; those who enjoy their action in pixel-form; fans of 2D Souls-like combat with lots of platforming mixed with their exploration; lovers of art, as the game has some haunting imagery and music. Two thumbs way, way up.

Blasphemous is a platformer souls like with an absolutely beautiful and unique art style. However, it suffers from a number problems that make it fall short of a truly fantastic game. It is however, a very good game if you have the patience for it's quirks.  

First and foremost, this game is filled to the fucking brim with instant death pitfalls and spike traps. There is no way to move the camera to look around at your surroundings; thus, you are going to have a lot of pointless frustrating deaths and resets to these traps. Dying also inflicts a debuff that reduces your mana till you collect your bloodstain (ala dark souls). If you die in a spike trap, that stain will be in the trap and you can't collect it. So you have to farm the currency of the game and go to a shrine to pay to fix it. These shrines are infrequent though not completely irritatingly inaccessible.

Enemy design is also pretty good for the most part. Most enemies are unique and the game does possess the occasional execution which is quite satisfying. Bosses seem very fair and fights are mostly skill based. This category however has a few of its own problems. Among them are enemy placement, and certain magic wielding nastiness. 

in a few places enemies  are placed in ways that pretty much force you to get hit by them; and if not hit by them, you get driven into traps. I understand were trying to be souls like here. But, every souls like game I've ever played (all of them mind you as a fan) do not setup scenarios that force you into damage. the spacing is setup in a manner where there is a learnable and appropriate response that where you can come out on-top unharmed. This is not going to be the case with Blasphemous. You are going to eat the damage, there is nothing you can do. Pick one or the other, and try not get frustrated by it. 

On the topic of certain magic wielding enemies who circumvent the blocking and counter system. I hope you enjoy spam, teleporting out of range, attacks that inconsistently for no reason either miss or hit  you. Furthermore, air borne enemies are difficult to combo, and are given enough health to make them difficult to kill. So far, most magic enemies are airborne. These are going to kill you a lot horribly. They usually show up with other things that also stop you from running past them or being able to carefully engage them.

Next and quite important to mention are controls. I haven't tried the game with a controller, but I assume it is far better than mouse and keyboard, which is what I use. If you decide to use a keyboard, be forewarned:
there is no mouse input. WASD for movement, J for block, and K for attack. Q for prayers (Spells that use this games mana system). Easy enough but the game doesn't tell you that you use Y and H to scroll descriptions on items in the inventory. I actually had to check steam discussions to figure that one out. 

All this being said, if you can tolerate instant death non skill based traps, sometimes poor enemy placement or design, and sometimes miserable map design. Then I fully recommend the game to you. It's worth full price. You are going to die in very non skill based ways. They are going to punish you. You will learn to like it, and adapt to it, or you are going to hate the game.

The general opinion seems to be that the exploration is too unforgiving, with the insta-death spikes and stuff. I don't think that is a problem, I think if you stay cautious it is not that bad, but i did have moments where i sigh as I look at the death screen. 
The art is phenomenon, if you are into this style, the imagery is gruesome but draws me in, I am more fascinated rather than scared. Just incredible.
I got 40/44 bones and 37/38 children of moonlight before i looked at the wiki, it is not that hard to find especially with the map markers. However beads and prayers are harder to find.
The combat is simple yet satisfying, and there with the usage of prayers you can easily defeat bosses, so the difficulty can be adjusted according to your style and build.

There is inconsistensy in how the tools you have been provided with interact with certain enemies, for example sometimes you can roll through an enemy, sometimes you cannot. There is no meaningful character progression to talk about and ""bonefires"" are put on the map without a rhyme or reason to be honest, same as with Hollow Knight it took wrong lessons from souls games. The platforming feels very janky as well.

What the game does well? The art style, execution animations and the lore are all very interesting and very well done, sadly it cannot overcome the fact that the gameplay is horrible.

I feel like most things in this game are rather forgettable. I haven't leveled my guy in so long because it's all stuff I'd never use or maybe forget I even had. I first unlocked a charge up power attack, but the time it takes for it to charge and the damage it does... You're better off just using the time to get like 3 or 4 regular hits in! What's the point?? And the little gains from beads/weapon mods also have so little impact that I find it doesn't really matter which ones you choose. But if it says you'll take extra damage, do believe that one.

The levels are pretty alright I must say and the art is pretty snazzy, but the game lacks shortcuts. It has them, just many aren't practical or very beneficial.

Back to forgettable aspects, the game teaches you how to counter on very counterable enemies. But soon you find one that if you counter, you just get knocked back without damage. Guess which method they chose to move forward with? Most mid to later enemies can't be countered or they just knock you back, so why bother trying to counter if I can just avoid the hit? Another forgotten aspect. And the ability to just dash through some enemies is hit or miss (literally). This is a huge bummer in some areas where you struggle and the walk back is lengthy and dangerous. 

The items you find are so obscure that I never know where anything goes or who is what. I'm swimming in quest items with no idea who wants what. I just roll up to someone, show them me stash, and see if they want anything I've got and if they'll give me something new.

Mechanistically I've found I both enjoy and dislike it. Sometimes you SWEAR you should have made that jump just fine, but here you are falling. Ladders are very finicky and I don't recommend rushing them. Which for a game that has sparse shortcuts... 

The game was fine but I doubt I'll come back. I might or might not play the second... I may just watch a stream. I've played a lot of metroidvanias and this one is just kinda meh on the design. Art is great, delivery is meh.",1703685886,1703685886,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

blasphemous is a metroidvania that takes most of its inspiration from castlevania, even the map is pretty similar, just bigger and more stuff to explore. blasphemous is huge, bigger than most metroidvanias. theres about 44 collectibles, tons of useful items, prayers and relics. these items help you explore the world and also unlock a secret boss thats important to finishing the game if you want to lore correct ending. 
the combat and gameplay is good but there are some inflicting parts that i dont really like. the over reliance on parries makes the game a little bit slower, its like samus returns remake, but a bit more faster and atleast easier to dodge and pass through enemies.  combos are really fun to hit and upgrading skills gives more combos and moves which makes the game a whole much easier and just a ton more fun.
the enemies are also very well designed, some of these enemies may beat your ass pretty bad and most of the time that means its better to explore the other areas first as every part of the game, theres atleast 2 - 3 bosses you can beat in any order so its great to explore. personally, some of these bosses are way more unfair than the other bosses. the secret boss isidiora took me about 2 hours to beat meanwhile the last boss took me less than a hour to beat which was dissapointing but the last boss was pretty fun and mostly required skill instead of just dodging and tanking random projectiles.
TLDR; blasphemous is an amazing game, a few flaws doesnt make this game bad. its really fun and i had my time with it, i might play NG+ if i dont have anything to play. its certainly a must play for everybody who loves metroidvanias and also people who love souls-likes and want to change it up a bit",1703580806,1703580806,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I bought it because I heard it had amazing lore and I like souls/metroidvania games. I wanted to like it so much but at this point I'm not sure it's worth the pain. This game reminds me of Dark Souls 1 but for the worst reasons. This game has combat and platforming but the combat is uninteresting and the platforming is janky as hell. An example is needing to enter an up input on ledges but it seems like if you're off  by 15 degrees with the joystick it decides it wasn't good enough. Then in combat there are situations which just feel silly like when you parry certain enemies their hitbox ends up inside you and you inevitably take damage which just feels weird. The combat is basically that every enemy has a specific way you can kill it and you should stick to that every single time or you usually get punished. Once you learn that parrying that enemy means you take damage for some god damn reason then you have to adapt to something that feels like a silly design mistake or something. That reminds me of souls games but it was not something I think is fun. As far as I saw the game has like two combos you can use, one weapon, no armour, one ranged attack and one slide attack. Then there's these relics which replace movement abilities I assume but one of the ones I got seems just like a lore revealer which is not great. My character feels almost identical to how he was at the start. I'm never excited by an item drop because 85% of them are lore related and speaking of the lore, I am not getting it. I started off reading all the item descriptions and exhausting npc dialogues but it feels like unless you're prepared to have google translate open for spanish to english, got a bible handy and a few essays on the spanish inquisition, you're not getting fucking anywhere. I watched a video after to explain it for me and to be honest it was just ok. Didn't seem as amazing as I had heard. So the character progression elements are non existent and unsatisfying, the platforming is janky and uninteresting, the combat is equally uninteresting (I'd like to add I've first tried every boss after the first couple and I really dislike games with piss easy bosses when you struggle on a little guy with a knife), and the lore is mildly intriguing at best. 

I will say that the art and music is very nice but the actual gameplay has been little but frustrating and if I have to TRY to like a game and still struggle then I can't possibly say good things about it. Additionally I've heard one source that said the reason the game pushes you and tests your patience so often and frustrates you is because the gameplay is meant to be like the suffering and hardship the penitent one is going through but this feels like a weird defense. 

If they want the game to literally feel like a frustrating pilgrimage that you would rather give up on then they succeeded in their weird artistic endeavour, I just don't get why they'd pick that creative hill to die on.

- Some of the quests (Redento's statue) are nearly impossible without looking up the solution, while others I think are pretty fair (like the chalice quest). I wish the game gave adequate clues for all the quests.
- If you don't visit a certain area before a specific boss fight, you can be blocked from a bonus area, requiring a new start. Granted, there is a new game+, but this was discouraging on my first playthrough.
- This game would really benefit from a quest log. Sometimes after taking a break I wouldn't remember what I had done already in specific quest lines.

For one, this game falsely advertises full controller support. In reality, controller support breaks when alt+tabbing, and doesn't work at all on the death screen. Given this is a soulslike, you are going to die a LOT, so controllers not working on this screen is a colossal oversight if you don't want to go through the headache that is playing platformers on keyboard. I guess the devs just never thought people would play a platformer game on devices originally built to play platformer games.

Furthermore, despite being a multiplat game (which the sequel doesn't even bother with, so much for 
the effort lmao), they managed to screw up cloud saves and make them platform-specific, leaving Linux users forced to use Proton which is prone to instability and Mac users just stuck with Mac. I used to have some restraint criticizing games for this until I learned how pathetically easy adding this feature is, ESPECIALLY in games made in Unity, like this one. They just didn't bother. By the way! The Steam Deck verification thing is supposed to have a notice if games don't support cross-plat saves! This game doesn't have that notice despite not having cross-plat saves. Because of this, I expected this game to have cross-plat saves. Thanks for that.

All and all despite great visuals and (I'm assuming) good gameplay, the game feels unfinished. They had THREE content updates to fix ANY of these issues and never did.

- The character's movement and moveset feel restrained. Every move besides the basic attack feels bad to perform as it either locks you into an animation, or takes too long to come out, or has an arbitrary delay at the end where you can't move.
- Enemies' behavior doesnt follow any rules. You sometimes can and sometimes can't go through enemies using a dodge, regardless of their size. You sometimes can and sometimes can't dodge through an attack. Enemies sometimes deal contact damage and sometimes don't. It's horribly inconsistent.

One of the most ghastly examples of religious horror in gaming, the Penitent One is forced to carve a bloody path across a blasted landscape of unending despair as you seek to unravel the origins of the dreadful Grievous Miracle, a quest not for the squeamish. Compared to a lot of other Soulslikes the story is more upfront and open, with multiple cutscenes and expository characters directing you forward, but there's still a great deal of worldbuilding to be learned from item descriptions and conversations with missable NPCs, and the story itself is gripping in its sheer remorseless bleakness. The addition of 3 extensive DLCs, released completely for free, that added vast amounts of extra content to the game (including a new true ending to lead into the upcoming sequel) makes the game (which was initially a bit short) vastly better value and cements my respect for the developers.

The gameplay is sharp and the control precise, with as much of an emphasis on platforming as combat, with a lot of ledge hanging, wall clinging, dodging past traps and bounding across collapsing floors. The combat, by comparison, is a bit streamlined, with only a handful of combat maneuvers at your disposal, some of which are quite unbalanced (the parry and riposte is far too generous and the dash stab is absolutely devastating, while the charged attack is just too slow to be much use), but there's an impressive array of equippable items you can use to help customise your combat style.

Technically, the game is a standout. The pixel art is some of the finest the style has produced in years, with every enemy (and their hideous, gruesome deaths) rendered in fine, bloody detail, particularly some of the gargantuan bosses. The voice acting is surprisingly high quality (although apparently a few poor performances were rerecorded with new actors before I got around to playing the game), and the soundtrack deserves special mention for its quality, variably tense, atmospheric, even beautiful in places.

Blasphemous, while not for everyone (either because of its brutal challenge or its nightmarishly-gruesome appearance) is a standout title in the 2D Soulslike Metroidvania genre which is an easy recommendation for anyone who enjoys exploration, challenging combat, and bleak religious horror.

Mechanically this game is very competent. combat is relatively simple, but well animated (and quite brutal). The world you get to play in is surprisingly vast as it opens up. Backtracking is common, but helped by shortcuts and warp points. The game allows for a fair bit of customization with the use of different rosary beads (similar to hollow knight badges but without different costs), prayers (like spells), and sword cores (usually does makes one thing better and one thing worse). The game isn't easy, but I didn't find it especially challenging either; many bosses I beat on my first try, and most of my deaths were from falls and spikes (which instakill) instead of any combat scenarios.

Aesthetically, the game utilizes amazing pixel art to portray a desolate and depressing Catholicism-inspired world, where everyone seems to be confusing suffering and salvation.

Story-wise...I feel like it's a hot mess. It talks a lot about guilt and suffering and 'miracles' and it doesn't really tie it together very well. The game gives you an early direction on some things to collect, but after you do that, there's the whole other half of the map to go through and I never really understood what the in-game reason was for doing so.

The religious stuff here is kinda weird; it's clearly inspired by Catholicism, but they focus on guilt, punishment, sin, and pain, and ignore almost anything else; you won't see any biblical figures or rituals in the game. It feels like the devs were trying to walk a narrow line between calling out the dark side of how the Catholic church handles resolution of guilt and sin, but keep some plausible deniability about their opinions on the rest of it. This leads to the game having a lot of religious 'window-dressing' (imagery and language), but it doesn't have as much substance as you might expect. It's kind of surprising given the game's title.

The music in this game is a lowlight imo. It's not bad, but it's entirely unmemorable compared to castlevania or metroid. Which is odd because it feels like the perfect venue for some epic chorale and organ stuff. It's mostly either highly atmospheric or variations of Spanish guitar music.

Overall, if you want to play a well-made metroidvania with some clear Souls inspiration and a unique (but hollow) religious theme, this is a good way to spend your time.

But oh my gosh they were wrong!! This game is brilliant. It is a visual feast with an extraordinary soundtrack and great lore & storytelling. It seems like the world is just constantly full of secrets lore- and gameplaywise. And that does not change after finishing the game. The mood is just perfect.
Difficultywise it is also very well done. Challenging but not cheap (maybe the jumping puzzles from the DLC sometimes are).

A fast travel option is somewhat hidden as a reward, and that is a feature you should get as early as possible I think.... that's about the only thing I'd warn people about.",1693168977,1702673852,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Combat was enjoyable, although I imagine some people may find one fixed weapon and a handful of combo's a bit limited (there are prayers/spells and accessories to customise your build).

This game is good. 

Pros/Cons:
Cons: 

1. There is a DLC quest and quest item that you cannot get if you kill a certain boss too early. If you do this, the questline gets locked until your next play-through. Is it important? No, but I wish I had been able to see the quest on my first time through. This only happened to me once.
2. I had to google what to do when the monk reached the statue. I was really confused. 

Pros: 

1. in-game DLC content appears to be free. There is a New Game+ mode that is significantly harder difficulty. I'll be able to experience that single quest during new game plus.

2. NPC character names and storylines are fantastic!

3. Artwork is amazing.

Presentation? One of the greatest in gaming history. It's the main thing this game has going for it. The atmosphere is incredible. Switching to the Spanish dub is highly recommended. Sprites look great, stages are varied and beautiful too, animations are CRISP as hell.

The lore is very interesting but probably too sparse to fully dissect in a single playthrough. There are multiple endings, so replaying the game is encouraged.

Gameplay-wise? Very hit or miss. Combat feels punchy and impactful but basic at times, even after multiple upgrades. Platforming is not bad, just irregular. Some elements, like ladders, are very unreliable and sometimes lead to instant deaths by spikes. It's especially annoying when the game has time-based sections that are not exactly easy.

World design is GREAT. There are shortcuts and hidden passages everywhere. Going back to Albero through an elevator after 3 hours of struggle is awesome.

Bosses in general are decent. They're good enough, and very memorable visually. Some are annoying but nothing too bad.

Level design is good when traversing and exploring, but it has one fatal flaw: The worst aspect of Blasphemous in my opinion. Enemy placement. Some sections are very tolerable. Not easy, but manageable with some thought. Other sections took a page out of Dark Souls 2 and decided to throw around a f*ckton of enemies for no reason other than padding an already decently long game.

It's pretty good! It just feels like it needed a bit more thought put into combat to reach that extra quality. I still highly recommend it for the atmosphere alone.

I don't think the bosses are particularly difficult, but they can definitely become annoying for someone who wants to learn each individual boss mechanic and/or combos in order to learn, practice, and then execute.

Aside from that, I think the combat is fun, the game is aesthetically pleasing, and the music is fantastic.

[h2] Pros [h2]
-Great mechanics
-Good learning curve
-Hard, rewarding, and fair game-play
-Interesting and diverse enemies and bosses
-Cool items and ""spells"" (called prayers in this game)
-Good story
-Great art
-Great music
-At least 20 hours of game-play

[h2] Cons [h2]
-This game forces you to check the internet for guides and tips since some hidden items are essential and some percs and buffs are hidden in secret rooms. Also some important game mechanics (like teleportation for example) are unlocked by doing some arbitrary actions that you won't do unless you check a guide or google some questions. Also, some missions will be locked because of arbitrary reasons of visiting a room in the wrong order. There are some endings, and unless you follow a guide from the start, you will get the worst one.

[h1] Conclusion [h1]
This game is hard, addictive, fun, beautiful and a journey you won't regret and may even play twice. I would recommend asking a friend for a tip or two since it might make the game-play a bit smoother.

A jogabilidade é boa, os graficos meio pixel art são bonitos, e tudo é muito bruto e difícil aqui. Não tem walljump, tem 'estocar a espada na parede e dar um pulo (!!)'. Esse tipo de coisa. 

A fluidez do jogo não é intuitiva, demorei um pouco pra entender que o jogo era de fato um metroidvânia. 
As fases e inimigos em geral são difíceis, então você acaba tendo que ficar bem treinado no jogo pra conseguir se virar. Espinhos no chão, por exemplo são fatais, assim como locais com 'nuvenzinhas' abaixo, indicando um precipício. Volta e meia somos atirados neles por inimigos.

Ainda não terminei o jogo, mas to vendo que tem mta sidequest, sem mta explicação.

A história é o que tem valido pra mim: Um mundo bizarro de sofrimento onde a culpa das pessoas foi materializada na forma de uma realidade severamente distorcida por meio do 'milagre', transmutando ela formas físicas em sofrimento extremo para expiação. 

Interessante lembrar que o jogo foi feito por espanhóis - país tão católico quanto o nosso - então é curioso testemunhar esse mundo distópico, quase uma mistura de céu e inferno cristãos, trabalhando com a tríade 'culpa-dor-redenção'. Quase todas as pessoas viraram monstruosidades horríveis, mas todo mundo diz estar satisfeito e até feliz, porque estaria espiando a própria culpa na forma de penitência. Sua própria espada chama Mea Culpa (minha culpa), isso aqui da um prato cheio pra qualquer psicólogo passar uns bons meses pirando na simbologia.

For those of you undeterred from getting the game by this review (most of you, I'm sure) I know many also dislike the wall statues.

The game is good fun when the only thing your mind is focused on is the challenge of increasing your skill at overcoming the game's many obstacles, but there are many 2D Souls-like MetroidVanias out there, and many in my library.

What a great game this is. I really must write first about the artistic direction of this game as it is one of the most beautiful pixel art there exists in the media. I'm really glad I played Blasphemous in the spanish dub. The voices and accents make so much sense in the context of the game that it becomes literally the intended way to play it.  I'd never imagine a Castilian dub to be this perfect. The animations and sequences are breathtaking, the OST is memorable and I really liked the inspiration in christianity for a lot of the concepts and themes explored in the story, especially around the theme of penitence that is key to understand all the sidestories and world building. 

Blasphemous breaks the model of metroidvania established by Hollow Knight as it's rather a 2D souls-like. You don't get permanent upgrades as your means to access to previously unaccesible terrain is by using relics, objects that have an effect on the environment. You have a wide variety of prayers (powers) that may suit different playstyles. I, however, found useful only 5 or 6 from the entire arsenal you have at your disposal.

Bad stuff first. 

My biggest gripe was the blue rose challenges. It wasn't that they were hard or bad, it was the fact that they highlighted the faults of the game to a blinding degree. Most notably, ladders are evil. Another small problem I had was the sword length. For me personally, it felt like it was just a few pixels too short. I felt like I constantly needed to be inside the enemy to hit them.  Most of the game was pretty straight forward with lore/cutscenes but the beginning cutscenes were so random and it wasn't explained at all (or at least I didn't hear/see an explanation). I wish the children of the moon light was tracked on the painting. Like it would show which one's you've gotten. (no numbers or anything just images of them corresponding to the one's you've gathered). The thimble quest is complete garbage. It should have been fixed and given some kind of explanation of what to do if you missed it. Had to watch a random youtube video after searching for a long time just to find out what to do.  Not really a problem but I would have liked to unlock a different character, kinda like castlevania. It could just be cosmetic and nothing else but it would be cool just for the sake of it. 


Good Stuff

They pretty much nailed like 98% of what makes a good metroidvania. The combat is great, items and powers are interesting and powerful. Exploration feels rewarding.

Once you learn the rhythm of certain enemies and areas, the game becomes so much easier. There are lots of secrets hidden around the map, which encourages you to explore it. I've restarted it twice already because I'm a perfectionist who wants to see how quickly I can get through old areas with the skills and timing I've learned (plus I messed up the Withered Olives quest on my first play through).

Aside from the mechanics, the game itself is absolutely stunning. The cut scenes are testaments to the capabilities of pixel art (which honestly makes the second game's animation look cheap by comparison). Execution animations are as brutal as they are satisfying.

There are merits to be found in most aspects of the game but it doesn't truly excel in most; 

     1.) The combat is above average but not notably so 
     2.) The sound design/soundtrack is above average but again, not amazing
     3.) The aesthetic design is great though (probably it's best merit, solid pixel 
           animations)
     4.) The exploration element is decent but is constantly hindered by questionable design 
           choices (spikes 
           and pits galore, enemies that you can't jump over or dash through, lots of gates 
           blocking paths, plenty

The world of Blasphemous is bizarre and magnificent at the same time, drawing most of its inspiration from the catholic church with Latin-gothic style. Fused with well detailed pixel art which also gives retro/nostalgic vibes.

Unfortunately, there are some badly designed aspects in the game design and level design that denies the full potential of the game's experience and enjoyment.

The combat is slow and heavily relies on parrying and dodging, which is fine since it is a souls-like game. But as the game progresses, the combat becomes repetitive and loses its charm. Same goes for the executions, they are fun to watch at first but eventually you've watch all of them several times and most of them are pretty long, so you'd just prefer to slay your enemies normally to make it faster.

There are items you can collect by exploring the game that will allow you to access new areas by manipulating your environment. One of the items allows you to drop down to 'bottomless pits' and then you can discover new levels and areas that are beneath. If you don't equip the item, you'll die from falling to the abyss. But there is no abyss, it is a path that continues to another section. That is very frustrating when you start the game and learn that pits are your doom, resulting in inconsistency of the game and confusion. Besides, these items have to be equipped in order to use them, but you only have 3 item slots and there are more than 3 items. That results in an annoying and unnecessary inventory management. Just imagine in Hollow Knight that you'd have to choose between an item that let's you dash to an item that let's you double jump because you don't have enough slots to equip them together and use them simultaneously.

Most of the intensity of the game comes from the level design. There are parts where you can walk to the next area and then face a pit and fall to your death. This can make you churn. Because this will happen most of the time when you travel from one area to another, like you mostly do in metroidvanias in order to explore new areas or revisit them. The level design doesn't support navigation from one area to another in a maximum pace, every time there is some obstacle or platforming that you don't want to deal with anymore but you have to do it again, that makes travelling around the game very tedious. Especially during the end game.

It's true that the game suffers some bad executions. But overall, I personally enjoyed the world of Blasphemous. There's some atmosphere that lies heavy on you throughout the game. The twisted world gives you a sense of danger wherever you go, there's something morbid in the air. The strange world building of Cvstodia was... different... and I enjoyed experiencing it.",1701219451,1701219451,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Blasphemous is a Metroidvania:  A very dark and gruesome themed game revolving around Spanish religious folklore.  Its influences can be witnessed through its incredible OST, use of Latin, and its talented and haunting (in a good way) voice actors speaking the word of the miracle.  If you do mulitple play-throughs, do  yourself a favor and switch the voice over language to Spanish.
I'd describe it as a darker version of the marriage between Dark Souls and Castlevania.  The ambiguity presented in this game is similar to Dark souls.  Item quest lines for unlocking access to all areas of the map are also ambiguous, however finding all of them is not necessary for game completion.  Blasphemous is hard, but not ""Dark Souls"" hard.
Mechanics aren't perfect, but they seem fairly tight.  I've read some frustrations over map navigation;  I see merit in that, however if you compare this to a similar game such as Hollow Knight, this game is simpler.

I've previously beat this game on another platform and I'm back for more - and with more content through TWO free DLCs.  If you are into Metroidvania style of games that appreciates good music and a very mature, mysterious presentation, then the developers deserve your money.  You won't be disappointed.  This is one of my favorites.

But it has flaw that makes me cannot recommend it to people who like to squeeze all the achievement and things to do in the game. TLDR: I recommend it to people who just wanna have short fun engaging game and not searching for true ending/achievement hunting.

What this game do well? The combat and the boss battle is quite engaging. Especially the early bosses. It is quite interesting and have really nice attack telegraph, combined with dodge and block that can makes being aggressive/safe gameplay quite interesting to do redo. I first try it in the demo, and the first boss is actually the one that hook me and makes me bought the game. 

What flaw that this game has? The exploring part. The first time you come to an area, it is fun and you won't mind a clunky control because you learn about the map, the enemies, checking secret passage, etc. But when you need to comeback to get missing/previously unobtainable item, you will mind about the slow and clunkiness of the movement set. There is a power up that enhance your movement set, but it feels like a patch and just make it a bit better rather than game changing.

What worse is the wall jump ability. You can only wall jump in certain places and when this places have flying enemies that fly through wall, you cannot attack them. It will makes you cling to the wall and you cannot attack it. But this is perhaps a game design. If it is game design to make enemies seems harder than it should, then I won't critique it too much. Perhaps there's a community that likes it, but certainly it is not for me.

The last part that really feels bad is the DLC. It is free so it should be good, right? There is new area in the DLC that aimed as end game content, but it was placed and can be accessed from mid game. In my first playthrough, I accidentally come in to this end game area with my mid game equipment and they just whoop my ass hard. The difficulty level just spike really hard without notice. It seems that they did not think about the placement/normal progression and just put the new area in the edge of the map and calls it a day.

Also, from the DLC, there is called Miriam's Challenges. It is a time attack quest crossover with Miriam from Bloodstained. It is called time attack quest, you are timed with time limit, but it used moving platform. The quest is hard too, so you are expected to redo it a few times until you can finished it. There is times where I need to open YouTube videos or something while waiting the platform to moves to retry my attempt. No matter how good you are, there will be down time just to wait for the platform to move. Even with the shortcut it there will be a down time to wait for a platform to move.

All in all, It still is a enjoyful experience, but the endgame--which usually when a Metroidvania games is the most fun because all the power and upgrade--feel lackluster and disappointing. The exploration in the end game feels really bad. I hope this is not the way in Blasphemous II, and I cannot bring myself to be interested in buying/playing the next Blasphemous title in near future.",1700907163,1700907163,False,0,0,0.47413790225982666,0,True,False,False

The character feels like it's actively fighting against your inputs. There is no mid air control, momentum, and the platforming just feels bad. There are multiple times where you will want to drop down to attack an enemy to gain a foothold only for your character to grab onto a nearby platform instead and insta death platforming sections to pad out long empty stretches between dungeons and bosses. Compared to recent games like Hollow Knight that do movement and controls 10x better it feels frustrating to play.

Combat is just fine and bosses are varied and cool looking but once you come to terms with the controls the difficulty tapers off fast. If you are somewhat familiar with Soulslikes or 2D hack and slash games you can pretty easily destroy most bosses in 2 or 3 tries which is disappointing since there's only a handful of them.

Overall, Blasphemous has some cool sections with it's world building and aesthetic but the controls and combat fall flat when compared to other modern Metroidvanias that just do those ideas better.

The game is wildly imaginative in its narrative, environments and enemy pool. It’s all a twisted fever dream of Spanish religious and folklore history: that concept of taking something familiar and accentuating certain elements; here, it is the macabre inherent in these themes.

Blasphemous, developed by The Game Kitchen, is a dark and atmospheric action-platformer that plunges players into a nightmarish world inspired by Spanish folklore and religious iconography. Released in 2019, this 2D side-scrolling game has garnered attention for its challenging gameplay, haunting visuals, and a narrative steeped in themes of redemption and penance.

One of the standout features of Blasphemous is its intricate and atmospheric world design. The game unfolds in the nightmarish land of Cvstodia, a place cursed by grotesque creatures and plagued by the echoes of a mysterious, divine calamity. The pixel art is stunning, bringing to life the twisted landscapes, eerie dungeons, and grotesque enemies in a way that is both horrifying and captivating. The attention to detail in the art contributes significantly to the overall immersion, making each area a visual feast for players willing to explore the unsettling depths of Cvstodia.

The gameplay is equally compelling, combining precise combat mechanics with challenging platforming elements. Players take control of The Penitent One, a silent and stoic protagonist on a quest for redemption in a world brimming with macabre adversaries. The combat system is punishing but rewarding, encouraging players to learn enemy patterns and master the use of a variety of weapons and special abilities. The level of difficulty may be a deterrent for some, but for those seeking a true test of skill, Blasphemous delivers an experience that is as unforgiving as the world it portrays.

The narrative is presented through cryptic environmental storytelling, religious symbolism, and haunting NPC interactions. The lore is deep and mysterious, with a narrative that unfolds gradually as players progress through the punishing landscapes. The themes of guilt, redemption, and atonement are woven into the fabric of the game, adding emotional weight to the dark journey of The Penitent One.

While the game has received praise for its atmospheric design and challenging gameplay, some players may find the difficulty level to be a double-edged sword. The unforgiving nature of the combat can be frustrating for those not accustomed to demanding experiences, potentially limiting the game's appeal to a specific audience.

In conclusion, Blasphemous is a masterclass in atmospheric design and challenging gameplay, offering a haunting journey through a nightmarish world. The combination of pixel-perfect art, punishing combat, and a deep narrative make it a standout title for fans of dark and atmospheric action-platformers. However, its high difficulty may be a barrier for some players, making it more suitable for those who relish a challenging and immersive gaming experience.",1700748275,1700748275,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Not my first souls game, but it is my first metroidvania. Finished it after 18 hours with 87% of the content completed, got Ending B (blind playtrough).

The idea of using this old spanish catholic theme for game of this genre its just amazing, specially when the devs have no fear of showing gore or crude themes, it really is amazing. The atmosphere of the levels, the pixel art, the music, its all top notch.

The bosses are just a piece of amazing work one after the other, from the visual design, to the lore they imply and surprisingly... the mechanics, no boss is a copy of another, they all have different mechanics you need to pay attention to. Some are big enough to engulf the whole screen, others use the level/environment for an advantage, others summon minions to help em and others are just a normal sized character like you. They really feel like a piece of art.

The puzzles are varied and actual puzzles you need to figure out how to approach em, tho sometimes can be hard due to the lack of clues. For example, to open certain closed door you needed to use the lever of an elevator 5 times in a row and i literally have no idea from were that came from, i ended up looking at the wiki because there was no dialogue, hint, number on the walls, picture, anything that hints that.

Now the gameplay, i know nothing of metroidvania games and how they are supposed to be, so im gonna give my opinion on this from a souls perspective: the dashing sucks, simple as that.

The parry is good tho you can't use it on like half the bosses or enemies, which i understand since the game forces you to jump around, duck OR dash.... and thats the problem, the game itself tells you the dash has invulnerability frames and it does not feel like that at all. While i do understand that you can't spam it (one dash after another) and there's even dedicated items in the game to help you with that, the i-frames on the dash are either super tiny or they just don't work on some enemies. Plus the response from when you press the button to when it gets executed on the screen is long enough to go to the kitchen and make myself a cup of coffee... well, not that long, but after playing a souls game i think you can understand what i mean.

But oh well, those few cons are not even close to deprive you from enjoying and finishing the game, so give it a try.

I give it a solid 9/10, may the Miracle... keep you? guard you?... not turn you into an abomination? anyways, have a good one sinners.",1696580694,1700637321,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The moment you enter the world of Cvstodia you're confronted with a dark and haunting reality that makes you keep exploring its depths. One of the standout features in Blasphemous is the world design. The landscapes are beautifully crafted, and have an incredible attention to detail, and some very challenging parts. The boss battles are a balance between challenge and fairness. The difficulty seems a bit lower compared to other games in this genre. 
Blasphemous has a unique storytelling approach. It invites the player to piece together the lore and history of Cvstodia through item descriptions and talking to NPCs. What makes Blasphemous truly stand out is its sheer brutality. The game embraces a visceral and bloody aesthetic. The concept of Pain is central to the experience, creating a world that is both disturbing and oddly satisfying. It is, in my opinion, what makes the game most memorable.
Overall, I'd say the game is definitely worth a try and another top game on my Souls-Like list

The controls are SO unresponsive. And they make the platforming and the enemies in ways that dont make it hard, but annoying to play.
You will keep falling to death because the character didn't grab to a ledge out of the blue.
Or because an enemy is put in a location that is annoying to avoid.
And most enemies are so easy, but have some super slow attack animation you have to wait out for, forcing you to stop and slow down the gameplay at every, single, darn, mob.
It is excruciatingly slow paced, and as soon as you get out of the ""first hour"" the platforming and enemies become especially annoying instead of harder.

I got this on a discount and played a few hours in already, so no refund for me anymore. But if I could, I'd still ask for a refund. Pretty sure I wont continue playing this.

1) The last boss was very unticlimatic. Way easier than every other one, with 1 BS move to make it artificially hard.
2) Again on the last boss (and second to last) - it's very poorly designed/implemented. Any enemy that relies on staying out of the screen, or invulnerable while you have nothing to do but wait or dodge his BS is not fun. That sword just sitting outside of the screen while the boss sits there spitting magic at you  when you can't punish is just a waste of time and quickly becomes an unfun test of patience
3) Seriously guys. Fix your bugs. This game crashes too much. Drops too many frames all the time when things get hectic (and you're supposed to be VERY precise at these times). Pixel art games should NOT drop frames. Mario Bros never dropped frames and ran on a toaster with more stuff going on. This is unacceptable.

I know what its trying to do, its trying to be a certain type of vania on a certain type of poorly lit souls, but I refuse to type the proper terms in to give this offering the proper search keywords

it favours difficulty over anything else, and thats not a hole i'm going to go down at all these days, so its a fault right there

The controls, and there are many of them, suffers from the same fault all games have when they have 10 controls, and that is ""what button to press"" If I need to jump, what results is a button press mashing event every 20-30 seconds to find the desired control and play with it. 

It does keep the same ability to 'just run past the enemies', but I dont know what i'm running to

There may be loads of lore and story, but after just under an hour of play, I was not aware of any of it, nor would I care about it, its  just a retro game of uninteresting response from me, which is a shame, as i'm sure its someone tried really hard to make a VGA game for the current 202x age, but just didnt decide to make it fun to play, rather than rely on the meme of difficulty over 'gud'

old gameplay memes like ""the monsters respawn after you rest at the holy bonfire"" just makes my heart sink of another pointless gameplay element intended to lengthen the time taken to get from point A to point B. DS2 had a novel twist on this, which I am not going to explain what this was, as it would alleviate required research, but it was reversed with the bonfire pumpkin. That novel addition made the game at least playable and the grinding was rewarded. I'm not sure if such a mechanic exists in ""BS"" but no information was given, its not going to get found out. 

The same attribute on death also applies to the little sliver of theft to the players ""MP"" bar. I dont know if BS calls it something else, if it did it was forgettable, so its the ""MP"" bar.  Why? why tf does the game have to steal this asset from me when the player dies due to bad gameplay and level concepts? I did not agree to this. it feels so cheap when the game stoops so low to ideas attempted and done and tried before. Why can't the game have something new and novel in it for a new gameplay experience

Blasphemous is a game that seems to revel in its own obscurity and difficulty, [b]often at the expense of player enjoyment[/b]. While the game boasts stunning pixel art and a captivating atmosphere, it's marred by[b] frustrating-level design[/b], [b]unclear objectives[/b], and an [b]excessive amount of backtracking[/b].


From the outset, the game throws you into the depths of its unforgiving world [b]without much explanation or guidance[/b]. The map, while aesthetically pleasing, lacks clarity and often leads to confusion and frustration. The game's reliance on cryptic clues and hidden paths makes it [b]feel more like a punishment[/b] than a rewarding exploration.


The combat system, while initially engaging, quickly [b]becomes repetitive and lacks depth[/b]. [b]Enemies are easily dispatched[/b] with basic attacks, and bosses, while visually impressive, follow predictable patterns that make them more [b]tedious than challenging[/b].


The game's true frustration lies in its [b]excessive amount of backtracking[/b]. Progress often requires collecting scattered items or completing convoluted tasks, forcing players to trudge through the same [b]familiar areas repeatedly[/b]. This repetitive nature makes the game [b]feel like a chore[/b] rather than an enjoyable experience.


While the game's art style is undeniably impressive, its dark and gritty aesthetic can become overwhelming after extended play sessions. The oppressive atmosphere and constant barrage of grotesque imagery can make it [b]difficult to maintain interest and motivation[/b].


Overall, Blasphemous is a game that seems to prioritize difficulty and obscurity over accessibility and enjoyment. While it may appeal to those seeking a punishing challenge, its flaws outweigh its strengths, making it a frustrating and unrewarding experience for many players.

Blasphemous es un metroidvania plataformero de scroll lateral cuya temática y estética, así como su combate meticuloso y relativamente exigente, lo asemejan lo suficiente a un Souls-like como para poder formar parte de dicha categoría.

El trabajo artístico es fabuloso, cada escenario es una belleza, cada jefe es visualmente único y cada track de la banda sonora aportan a la atmósfera de esta fantasía oscura inspirada en el Cristianismo.

Sin contar unas tres o cuatro veces que quedé atrapado en un hilo de ataques consecutivos de los cuales no pude escapar, en su mayoría Blasphemous es una experiencia justa y bien planteada, cuyo diseño de niveles es generalmente demasiado formulario pero completamente efectivo, destacando por cuán bien guía al jugador por el camino correcto y ofreciendo la cantidad suficiente de secretos como para compensar la atención al detalle.

Y aunque el ritmo de su combate denoten un evidente aire a Souls, ni los escenarios ni los jefes son particularmente exigentes hasta el último tercio. 

Quizá hubiera trabajado más en el backtracking, que es demasiado constante y monótono. Mientras que en otros Metroidvania adquirir una nueva habilidad representa una forma completamente distinta de manejarte por el entorno, en Blasphemous el juego empieza y termina prácticamente igual.

Incredible art, unique animations and secrets everywhere, plenty of questlines and rewards for thoroughness, and a lot of great bosses without any real dip to the game's pace. The design team wanted a game that felt like it could've been Symphony of the Night, and I think they far surpassed that goal.

It took me two failed attempts to get into Blasphemous but on the third try it finally clicked.
Although there are still a few things that I don't like about the controls (ladders, ledge grabbing and the slow base movement) once the game opens up and you have a few upgrades to work with (Rosary beads and combat skills) then the game becomes a lot more enjoyable.

The lore and artwork are unique and interesting the bosses are likewise and all feel unique. The soundtrack is immersive too with the sound design also feeling appropriately creepy.

Over all I think Blasphemous is definitely worth your time and I'm glad i finally got into it.
IMO don't play it after a similar game (e.g GRIME) like I did because it will start you off with preconceptions about the controls.
Off to play Blasphemous 2 now.

-has a very simple combat system (which I know can be expanded but for 95% of the game you'll just be using the standard moveset ) which gets boring very quickly
-health and fevor upgrades are few and far between
- two of the most profitable quests require a guide to properly complete
-relics(I only have a complaint about one relics and its the one from the 3-headed creature,like, no casual player would have figured out how to progress their questline without looking up a guide and it is also one of,if not,the most essential relic when exploring cuz a lot of bone part,sword hearts and prayers require it)
-enemies either have infinite hyperarmour or none at all, some enemies  literaly cannot be ignored bc you MUST kill them to pregress further(looking at you humanoid statues in the ice area), the flying wizards can be knocked out of bound but they can still attack making the early game(when you don't have the holy blood throwable) very frustrating
-hit boxes are fine for the most part except for the nuns with the giant bell weapons
-OST's are solid ,nothing catchy but fitting
-early and mid game bosses are fun to fight but the late game ones are just frustrating(I am refering to the bell dude on the bridge ,the fire dude in the prison area,the last two bosses of the base game and the Gravetender lady where the bone collector is )
       -my main complaint about them is that it is near never clear when exactly the attack is going to happen due to the 
        animations being badly telegraphed and you will most certainly mistake one attack animation for another (take 
       a look at hollow knights attack animation and how very well telegraphed they are)
-fast travel locations are few and far between which wouldn't be a problem wasn't the games mobility so slugish
-prayer are either situational , underwelming, or down right busted like the one that creates two circling balls around you and the one that negates ALL DAMAGE for a couple seconds
-the fevor(mana) bar fills up far to slowly(it almost feels like they didnt want you to use it to begin with)
-no i-frames when after getting knocked down by an attack resulting in an easy stunlock
-having to waste a rosary slot just to be able to see the enemies health
-the jumping animation can feel incredibly slow for the fast humanoid bosses
-there are maybe one or two openings when you can safely heal up 
-healing animation is to slow
-i dislike the concept of having to sacrifice some of your currency AND heath to give yourself a chunk of fevor(which is pretty small if you want to use stronger prayers)
-the game is very unclear what you are supposed to do after entering the Mother of mothers
-sword hearts give mediocre buffs but give insane debuffs

These are all the things I can think of at the moment, wasn't really invested in the story but the visuals we stunning

Now,I don't want to make the game seem like it was made by the miracle(ha,get it) but ,taking into accountablilt everything  I have listed here, I really can't recommend this game to the faint hearted, more casual players 
for that I would rather recommend hollow knight",1698595909,1698595909,False,5,1,0.515692174434661865,0,True,False,False

Some of my favorite games are the Souls games, Hollow Knight, Celeste, Dead Cells, every Castlevania game. 

Beautiful & some definite love has gone into Blasphemous. I just feel like the developers lost sight of their goal and embraced ""sadistic outlet"" over ""fun challenge"" for the player at some point.

The gameplay is slow/clunky, the platforming is poorly designed (platform hitboxes are not accurate to their sprites. Among other issues), the enemies encourage bad playstyles to circumvent their bad design (see: ghost aimbotting, shooting through things, & player inability to hit more than once per appearance. Forced combat pacing is LAME and anti-fun)

Player hitbox is awful. Tip of your hat bumps an enemy shield? Say bye to half your health. So immersive.

Enemy projectiles have precedence over your attacks EVERY TIME. You hit an enemy as they are throwing something, even though you are able to hit projectiles? They win. You must sit & wait. No aggressive play for you. Forced combat pacing is LAME and anti-fun.

Dialogue is ye olde flowery but says very very little. Cheesy & goofy all around. Especially coming from some random hermit that's been sitting in the dark for however long, but hot damn does he speak with the eloquence of a medieval academic!! I did enjoy the item lore quite a lot, though, even though things are re-used in some places (looking @ you linen cloth and evolved version), and some descriptions make zero sense on whatever item they were attached to. 

I can see why people would love this game, really, but for me it does not hold a candle to HK, Dead Cells, or literally any of the Souls games. It tries & it pays homage to many of them (loved the window quests), but it just felt like the focus was on making the experience painful rather than challenging. In my time played, I went through the northern area (village?), & the mountains. Both to completion. I had fun for the tutorial area before Albero but the following areas just felt like tech demo slogs. 

At the end of the day, I like this game for what it is, but I'd never recommend it to a friend. I did not have fun playing it. Total slog for me, which sucked because again, thematically, I really really really wanted to love it. I really had expected to honestly & maybe that's why I was so disappointed by some of the design choices made. My $0.02.",1663262961,1698513921,False,8,0,0.511266529560089111,0,True,False,False

That boss is very difficult to be in that area, if it was a final boss, I can say: ""Okay, this is final boss!"", but no.  I have spent some much time upgrading my status and abilities in order to defeat this boss, but with no luck.  I have completed all of the other areas, and not this boss stops my progress.  I think the developers were trying to mimic Dark Souls games, but forgot to keep the fight fare and balance with this boss.

Another thing that I do not like is when the game punishes you for dying; you loss a portion of your magic meter.  And when you re-spawn, you magic meter is depleted.  Making me not want to use it at all for any reason.

The developers decided to copy the stuff that people hated about the Souls games, and add them to this game, instead of copying the good stuff people loved about those games.

Anyway, I will continue to try to fight this middle boss, but I am not having fun with this game, which is the main point of playing games in first place.  Wish me luck!

[I] “I wonder what’s going inside the Art Director’s head when he made this.” [/i] 
[hr][/hr]

[I] Blasphemous [/i] caught my attention when it reminded me of similar games like [I] Castlevania [/i], and how it’s talked along with [I] Bloodstained [/i]. So, I had my expectations high, and it delivered, the world of Blasphemous is horrifying and intriguing that it just makes you want to play more and find out more around this world. Characters, cutscenes, and Voice add more that it can make you play again, and the developers know and gives you more content to play around and achievements to achieve. 

For the base game, it’s an open-world, you are given quest locations that you can do in any order but certain quests can be missable, making you either load your previous save or create a whole new game, choices are permanent and sometimes the smallest actions can create a huge difference to how NPCs will end up, some only impacts the side quests but some can lock you out from achieving a certain ending. 

The choices you make, doing side quests, collecting collectibles reward you. You can see [I] Albedo [/i] improve as you continue to help them, certain NPCs reward and/or improve your character making things easier than the trouble you went through made it easier for later. 

I highly suggest using an interactive map, tracking collectibles and guiding where they are, the map is huge, and you might get lost going where next or lose count on how far you’ve progressed collecting. 

With that said, with such a huge map, every time you enter a new area or approaching a boss, it felt foreboding because the enemies and bosses you’ve went through were horrifying and grim that makes you say [I] “What the fuck” [/i] makes you more intrigued what this new area has in store for you. The music is amazing that you can feel how scary fighting against these enemies. 

[hr][/hr] 
[h2] DLCs / Extra Content [/h2]
[hr][/hr]
For extra content or the DLCs in this game, they are certain DLCs that were more of a hit or miss to me. [I] Wounds of Evertide [/i] is an extra content which adds a lot in the game, and just makes the game all the better, the bosses, the enemies, the music, I couldn’t forget how much fun I had fighting them and how many times I have died fighting them. 

[I] Strife & Ruin [/i] was the most infuriating moment I had in this entire game. Learning there was a collaboration with [I] Bloodstained [/i], I was expecting a playable character, an interesting boss fight but all it gave me was just LADDERS. Well, it’s a Time Trial that mostly consists of ladders and spikes, and thanks the miracle that this is completely optional, that it is not needed to complete on getting 100% of the game because I quit pursuing this quest halfway through because on how much I hated it.  

And the rewards seemed disappointing when I looked it up, all the trouble just to get a Prayer. 

[I] Stir of Dawn [/i] is the extra content I have yet to review, perhaps if I have the extra free time, I can rewrite this review and talk about this, but as far as I know, this is the New Game+ content of the game.

I think the game can do a better job in explaining quests, especially side quests and I hate the fact that they force you to replay from the start to see some things since there are missable checkpoints where if you missed them you lock yourself out of content.

Some early platforming sections aside, Blasphemous really respects the player's time and doesn't wallow in cheap deaths. Small things like enemies can't knock you off platforms if you're not airborne, you can refill magic at a slight health/currency cost whenever, and more really sand off design edges where many other current developers are wallowing in bull***t to make you angry. If you're tired of playing games that are ""Dark Souls-inspired"" (read: a lot of bad difficulty balancing and mean-spirited level design that makes you not want to repeat the same souls run again and again), this is a breath of fresh air.

It's not without its minor issues (fast travel could be better, the way the updates was implemented is jumbled and confusing without Googling, etc) but all-in-all a game that only becomes more fun the further in you get. It's never particularly complicated or difficult at length (you rarely get stuck) and some people might want deeper combat, but the rich art and generous parry system means you're always seeing something new (gorgeous and/or upsetting to gaze upon) and moving at a steady clip.

[h1]Introduction[/h1]
[b]This review is based on playing on the Steam deck.[/b]
[b]Blasphemous[/b] is a brutal 2D metroidvania/souls-like amalgamation about the burdens of devotion and honour and what it takes to achieve your goals despite a world cast against you. With a heavy focus on cerebral combat, precision timing and understanding your skills [b]Blasphemous[/b] attempts to take the mantle of genre classic, but does it have what it takes? So take up your blade, steel yourself with your faith and discover a land that seeks penance or be the one to make it fall to the hungering darkness that awaits the hopeless.

	[td]🟩 There are few means of fighting the vast army of foes that stand in your way. You must become familiar with your limited arsenal and how to best utilise it to succeed.

🟩 The map is large but not overly. There are several biomes to explore, plenty of secrets to uncover and items in abundance to collect.

🟩 Bosses are not only significantly powerful beings. They are also unique experiences to discover, with each being vastly different from the last.

🟩 A wonderfully unique art style that depicts sadness through pixelated forefront and painted background scenery to create an immersive environment.

🟩 And lastly: an immaculate audio selection that accompanies the journey, with excellent sound effects and a song for every situation that captures the moment astoundingly well.

	[td]🟥 Despite how fun the boss fights are, they peak in challenge very early into the game, and the title becomes substantially easier until the end.[/td]

[h1]Story[/h1]
The once prosperous lands of Cvstodia have fallen from on high at the hands of a foul curse that has come to be known as The Miracle.

You take control of the Penitent One as he awakens from the dead to bear witness to the massacre of his brothers and sisters for opposing the church he once served. With the sacred blade Mea Culpa, he must travel across this tainted world, purging it of its corruption and bringing penance to now-dying lands that embody it.

I genuinely adored the story written here. A tragic tale that cradles you from the moment you start the journey to the moment it ends, delivering you an account of betrayal and vengeance, and as the screen goes dark for the last time, you are left to contemplate if the fight was worth the victory.

[h1]Gameplay Analysis[/h1]
[h3]Requiem Aeternam[/h3]
You will spend most of your time in Blasphemous fighting against the people and creatures that call Cvstodia home, so it is best to become acquainted with the mechanics of how to do so effectively as quickly as possible.

🟩 You have very few means of self-defence early into the game, so you will become familiar with dodging, parrying and counter striking at opportune moments. Firstly, evading is the most straightforward and useful tool because completely removing yourself from the path of danger is the safest method to keep living. The alternate approach that is far more critically timed is the parry mechanic, where you remain at risk to perfectly time a block, stun the enemy and allow a window for you to counterstrike.

🟩 You will slowly build an array of magical abilities as you discover them in hidden and secret places that can be useful in giving you an edge in combat. They vary from buffs to more versatile damage spells.

🟩 Lastly, and probably the most important tool on your belt, is the sword you have in your hand. The Mea Culpa is a sacred blade that starts pretty weak despite how it looks but will gradually get stronger until it becomes as feared as it should be. You upgrade its versatility at shrines located across Cvstodia and by spending Tears of Atonement, which serves as the currency in Blasphemous.

🟥 Boss encounters will be your greatest challenge in testing your growing abilities, as they vary from relatively simple in both method and style to far more complex and challenging. My one major bugbear lies here as there is a rather steep difficulty curve early on, but once past that, the rest of the game becomes spectacularly easy.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3014195123

[h3]Detestatio Sacrorum[/h3]
🟩 The remainder of the experience will entail you exploring the world, and there is a literal plethora of secrets across the game to locate, varying from collectibles to story-related key items and lore-related entries, to name a few.

🟩 These items can help you unlock some seriously invaluable powers which will greatly assist you on your travels, and for the truly vigilant, it can deliver you a new ending.

🟩 Thankfully throughout your journey you will have access to an ever updating map that provides a lot of helpful information you can utilise to traverse the world and locate those pesky hidden items you may have missed. The map also marks specific places of interest and allows you to add your own custom markers as points of reference.

[h1]Audio and Visual[/h1]
[b]Blasphemous[/b] is probably one of the more eye-catching Metroidvania games I have ever had the chance to experience as it has a firm grasp on a very classic retro style in both how it looks and plays, but at the same breath, the beautifully drawn backgrounds are astounding to take in. 

It is also extremely graphic despite its style, and I would not recommend anyone drastically underage to play this title as many of the themes are extremely adult in nature.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3014195305

The audio is much the same, and it wasn't till about 5 or 6 hours into the game that I realised how amazingly the sound effects coupled with the sad, down-trodden music that echoes through your ears in each new biome.

[h1]Deck Performance and Specifications[/h1]
The deck delivered the seamless experience I've come to expect of the device whilst playing [b]Blasphemous[/b]. The game had no graphical or technical issues to report whatsoever.

With the game set to default for the deck, the battery consumption was fair, giving about five hours of life from a full charge.

[h1]Final Thoughts - Excellent[/h1]
[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2529084785]Review chart here.[/url]
To say that I have played a lot of Metroidvania games in my life would be a severe understatement, and I am an avid and appreciative fan of the souls and souls-like genre, I wanted this to be clearly known, so when I say that [b]Blasphemous[/b] for me was amongst the best experiences, I've had within either of these genres in the past. The whole formula just worked really well for me, and despite some rather small difficulty issues, this was an exceptionally compelling journey that I hope to re-experience numerous times over the years. A worthwhile purchase at any price.

I think the game is fun, has great metroidvania exploration and collectibles. Elevated by deeply engaging thematic content. 

Despite what an initial look (and the title) might suggest, I would say this is only partially about religion. Far more substantively I believe this is a game concerned with the way we conceptualize pain. Most specifically the virtue of pain, expressed here through the lens of holiness, but more widely applicable in what we find beneficial pain culturally. The idea that someone must be punished with pain or suffering for their wrongdoings, whether it would be best to relieve someone of their pain or if it would be more virtuous to let it continue.

Religion mostly occurs here to convey the idea of a standing dogma that idolizes pain. The language of religion here is partly exaggerated to convey an extreme reverence for pain. Partly though, it is indicative of the idea that religion is often the lens used to justify what pain is good pain and what pain is not. In that way, I think this game has a lot to say about religion. It would be, however, quite short sighted to limit this critique of pain being a means of virtue, when the same narratives are so prevalent in general cultural understandings.

I mean to say this game doesn't merely say ""look at these antiquated religious zealots"" and go ""religion bad,"" the bigger ideas say that suffering is an ugly thing, and relegating the blind worship of suffering to being antiquated practice would only be a way to put off examination of our own ideas about pain and how we feel about the pain of others.

Pretty wild game though, this one is extremely deep. Great fun, with some real wicked art direction.",1697062566,1697062566,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Highly recommended.

Story and Setting: The game's story is deeply rooted in religious themes, with players taking on the role of ""The Penitent One,"" a silent protagonist on a quest to break a curse that has befallen the land of Cvstodia.

Gameplay: ""Blasphemous"" is known for its challenging gameplay, drawing inspiration from games like ""Dark Souls.""

Difficulty: This game is notorious for its high level of difficulty. Some players may find the steep learning curve and punishing combat frustrating, while others will relish the challenge. 

Sound and Music: The soundtrack and audio design in ""Blasphemous"" are hauntingly atmospheric and contribute significantly to the game's overall mood. 

Replayability: ""Blasphemous"" offers some replayability through its multiple endings and New Game+ mode. 

Conclusion: ""Blasphemous"" is a polarizing game. Its dark, atmospheric world and challenging gameplay are its strengths, but they may also be its weaknesses for some players. If you enjoy challenging action-platformers with a heavy dose of religious symbolism and a distinctive art style, ""Blasphemous"" is worth checking out.",1696930415,1696930415,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

So far the game feels pretty good. The visuals and story thus far have been excellent and the sense of progression in terms of finding new upgrades and collectibles is paced well. Combat feels a bit middling and clunky, but it's hard to tell if this was an intentional design choice to make it feel more ""Souls-esque"" or simply a minor failure of design. I hope that the few problems I have with the game so far are improved in the sequel.

Pros:
-Excellent design and setting
-Combat generally feels good with some failings
-Sense of progression and finding new items is good

However, it's important to note some aspects that might not appeal to everyone, as well as my own experiences and what I've heard from others.

Hack and Slash: This game leans towards the hack-and-slash genre, which might not be everyone's cup of tea. If you're not a fan of this style of gameplay, it might not be the best fit for you.

Abundance of Items: The game boasts a vast inventory of items, which can sometimes lead to the need for external resources or guides to understand their full potential and usage.

Early Game Challenges: In the initial stages, the game can be a bit demanding as you work to accumulate currency, explore, and avoid perishing.

Confusing Elements: At times, the game's intricacies and plot can become a bit perplexing, potentially requiring extra attention to fully grasp.

Complex Lore: The game's lore can be intricate, and not everyone may delve into it deeply. Some players might prefer a more straightforward narrative.

Multiple Endings: There are reportedly three different endings in the game, which might not appeal to those who prefer to move on to new experiences once they've completed a game.

Despite these considerations, I personally found these aspects to be engaging rather than off-putting. The hack-and-slash gameplay, adorned with visually stunning gore effects, was right up my alley. The music resonated with me, and the pixel art was truly captivating.

If you share my passion for 2D games, adventurous exploration, metroidvania mechanics, diverse item combinations, and varied combat styles, then I highly recommend giving this game a shot.

On the positive - 
The artwork here is absolutely gorgeous, and the bosses are equally interesting and fun.  I didn't know exactly what I was getting into when I first loaded it up, and quickly realized the game expects you to put some effort into beating it.  It's on the harder end of the spectrum, but the combat is very fun and rewarding.  The enemy variety is tremendous - there's always a new enemy to encounter and nothing gets stale.  The theme and presentation are consistent and immersive.

On the negative - 
I got a little frustrated towards the end-game where a couple sections took me more tries more than I'd have liked, and one of the game's main ways of making things more difficult is by making you complete longer and longer sections between save locations.  Towards the end I forgot where something was on the pretty sizable map and I kinda knew what I needed to do, but wasn't completely sure.  The game does very little to guide you or tell you where to go or what to do.  You're also probably not going to just stumble on to the ""true"" ending unless you look it up.

Overall -

It's pretty good for the most part, the voice acting and writing is amazing and I love the whole setting but the game definitely has its flaws as well.
For example, I fell through the floor at the final boss and sometimes my character would not load when ascending an elevator so I had to go back to the main menu and reload.
Furthermore, I think the combat, while it does work, is the bare minimum required for a game like this.
What bugs me probably the most is the fact that you have to walk everywhere even after you've reached the endboss. Sure, there are portals like in Castlevania, but traversal is just so damn slow and there's only a handful of portals.
So if you want to 100% the game, get ready for a [u]ton[/u] of walking.

The atmosphere is top notch all the way. The writing, the visuals, the music. Everything fits together perfectly. Also, while it's very bloody and somber, it doesn't feel feeling gimmicky nor does it feel like the devs going ""omg look at what we did here!""

Outside that, lots of secrets to find in fairly varied areas. Progress feels meaningful and rewarding.

Difficulty-wise, it's a good ride. It's challenging but not mean. There are a couple of bosses with some nasty attacks, but outside that, it shouldn't be too frustrating - and there are plenty of chances to buff up the character beforehand, if need be.

The game includes free DLC, which is nice. For example, challenging time trial areas, which initially drive one crazy, but feel very fulfilling once you succeed. Nothing too distractring from the main course, but good garnish.

I hadn't realized how much I wanted to play such a well-made metroidvania before I picked this one up.

Of course there are many games you could call similar to souls games, such as Hollow Knight, but that game didn't necessarily contain the spirit of a souls game. Many games take the functional part of those games, without also considering the narrative or artistic style that From Software has achieved during the making of the souls series.  This is what blasphemous does.  Game mechanics wise, it's a competent, smooth 2D metroidvania with sparse checkpoints, perilous platforming and out of this world artistic  style.  But what it incorporates that truly make this game an achievement, is a comprehensive and thought provoking narrative about blind faith.  This pairs up with the art style really nicely to create a brute, unforgiving world where your goal is to do something of meaning.  Whatever ending you choose, in this game, what really matters is the fact that you did it and reached the end.  The confusing story makes it difficult to understand if you had any impact in the world, but that's irrelevant.  You gain purpose because you went through the game.  That I think i the heart of souls narratives, and this game does it better than any 2D metroidvania I've seen (yes, including Hollow Knight).  However, the game play left too much to be desired. It didn't pair up as well as other metroidvanias do with their story.  There is of course a narrative reason for everything that you have at your disposal, but what didn't pair up well is a really important part of these type of games: character growth.  This game has  a leveling system, but it didn't feel as satisfying to actually get to the end in 2 ways:

1. A game like Hollow Knight makes you feel much more powerful if you find specific items in the game, since it almost always means an upgrade.  But specifically, it constantly mixes gameplay styles you can choose from.  Blasphemous has only 1 weapon, and that's it. It has lots of spells, but it takes too long to use one of them, and their effects are not all that different at the end.

2. Typical souls games made by From Software pair up the upgrade system with character growth. A great example of this is Elden Ring, where you feel a bigger sense of achievement because you get materials needed to perform an upgrade.

Of course, Blasphemous is like neither of these games.  It's a 15-20ish hour game which doesn't need such complicated mechanics. The problem is though, that those mechanics are essentially just wishes that were left by me when I finished the game.  I wanted more.  But Blasphemous didn't show that much gameplay. It being short was not a problem, mind you, but the big problem is that the game could have become much braver when it came to the part of conceptually designing gameplay mechanics.  It kind of is already, there are for example many death pits in this game which would confuse and frustrate players, but they were done carefully such as to never be as annoying as platforming sections in Castlevania games.  The real problem for me though, was that it didn't do enough of these things: The gameplay lacked the variety and beautiful color to truly represent the narrative of this game.  Therefore, it's easier for you to struggle understanding why this  this game is entertaining you. I did, but that's only because I came into this game knowing it was going to be a 2d souls game. 


In conclusion, this game is a beautiful, well built game which will likely be very fun for most that play.  However it's arcane narrative may be lost to some players not because they hadn't tried to get the feel of it, but due to the game not having gameplay complex enough to warrant people reading, or caring enough to explore it more.  The thing that truly sets this game apart though is that it successfully reinvents in my opinion the most important aspect of a souls game (narrative-visual-gameplay loop) into a 2D metroidvania. So overall, it was a really great time for me.

OK, this game is a GEM.
it is legitimately fun.
It starts off feeling really easy. Almost too easy. but man oh man does the difficulty level get hard fast. It takes skill, timing, strategy, and a little luck sometimes. The game play and controls are very smooth and responsive especially once you understand the controls.

One thing to note. The default keybindings (mouse & keyboard) are the absolutely worse I have ever seen in a game. I can't think of a dumber way to set the default control scheme. Why the Devs chose this is beyond me. The good thing is you can remap all the controls in options. There are lots of reddi post, steam threads, and other sites with tons of ppl asking for help in re-mapping the keybindings. (seriously the Devs have the worse intuition in assigning keybindings/controls). 
In order to get to the options menu, you have to open the map first and press ""O"". I never would have guessed this, and why the Devs didn't just go with the ""press Esc key"" to get to the main menu is ridiculous. 

ok, so end of negative rant about keybindings. Once I changed all the keybindings my game play is seamless and fun. 
The story is very dark, and I hope the makers of this game can sell the movie or TV rights, because this IP would make a fantastic movie/ series. The voice acting is top notch, and the writing is sooo good. If you love the darker elements of someone like Clive Barker (Hellraiser, Lord of Illusion, Book of Blood, nightbreed etc.)  you will love this story setting. 

For such a simple looking game it is really a pleasant find. I bought it on a whim and do not regret my purchase.

edit: Just to add, if this game came out in the late 90s early 2000s it would be on everyone's list as one of the best games of all time.",1696065359,1696065469,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I had high hopes for the game, especially considering the themes it was going to tackle: religion piety, dedication, mystery, striving for greatness. But after spending 15 hours of play on this game, I just could not bring myself to finish it.
I'll start off with the good - graphics look amazing, and each boss is an artwork deserving of presentation in a church or a monastery as an icon. The map is rich and full of secrets. The enemy variety is enough for its purposes.
That leads to my criticisms: the gameplay is way too simple. Yes, you can unlock many different attacks, spells, upgrades, but for the most part the game consists of Dodge, Spam attack, Dodge, Spam attack, sometimes use Spell etc.. And to be honest, that might've been enough for a recommendation, but the story (or lack there of) is what snuffed out my interest completely.
I was hoping some sort of integration of game mechanics and story themes, where the symbolism, the metaphor is intertwined with the gameplay, but the gameplay and the story seemed to begrudgingly shake hands when absolutely required. The only mechanic I can think of that had any sort of symbolism behind it was 'cutting' yourself to open a locked gate, and then there was no use for it. (I am aware that you can cut yourself to fill your Mana/Penance, but you can easily ignore that).
Honestly, at that point in the game I felt like the developers (who have done a great job of making this game) made a good, but a bit standard, metroidvania, and then chose the setting of near-catholic world, where sin is manifested in real world. And even then, just as so many other storytellers before, came up with the idea of making the church/gods/saints the bad guys/corrupt.

TLDR: a good, if not standard, metroidvania with a fine gameplay loop, but the story-mechanic dissonance kills all interest",1696057846,1696057846,False,2,1,0.515191316604614258,0,True,False,False

The grimy and visceral visions of grimdark catholicism is, beyond the cyclopean richness of Warhammer 40k, pretty much an underused setting. Everywhere we go we are bombarded by gnarled roots and roses, twisted gothic architecture with an overdose of skulls, death, spikes, and holy symbols. On top of that we have a gameplay revolving around the meticulous collection of various anatomical features of dead geezers and crones, prayer beads and suffering to increase our everlasting torment.  

The story takes place in Cvstodia, the epitome of Catholicism gone haywire where we play as the last of a fraternal fellowship of coneheaded penitents sworn to silence. On our quest to topple the chosen one of the miracles we encounter fellow blasphemers, saints, sufferers and dogs. Honestly this game reeks of atmosphere and I guess the artwork and setting is somewhat of an acquired taste. If you find blood, gore and weird pseudo christian symbolism a bit too much, you might want to pick another game.. 

At íts core Blasphemous is a classic Metroidvania, albeit a rather cryptic one. The nonlinearity of the maps are spot on and to traverse the twisted landscapes we need to gather relics to alleviate our mortal forms limitations. Sometimes I found this to be a bit too cryptic, almost to a fault. However the gameplay in large is hugely satisfying and combined with the lovely worldbuilding I would say that this is a fantastic game! The boss fights are a mixed bag, I loved some of them, others were, well, way too harsh or way blander than expected.. All in all the gameplay is a slightly worse Hollow Knight, take it or leave it..   

In the end I highly recommend Blasphemous to anyone into great Metroidvanias. This is an instant classic and I really love when a game dares to not include an obvious double jump in the list of potential upgrades.. Enjoy it for the handcrafted images if nothing else, I never thought i'd be this intrigued by reinvented Catholic liturgy.

I couldn't put the controller down as I wanted to continue to progress through this 2D metroidvania. Most of the game seemed pretty linear in terms of the progression. The story was compelling and, as the protagonist, you wanted to learn more about this world you were immersed in. The combat is simple to pick up and mobs are not egregious. Save locations are placed fairly distant from one another, giving a fair challenge. Variety in buffs allow some semblance of choice within the game as well. 
The longer I played however, was when the flaws started to peak out. This became especially apparent with NG+.

From a completionist stand point, there are achievements that are completely miss-able, which includes the 100% achievement. There are absolutely no indication within the dialogue of NPCs to guide players for certain key items (such as the item for double jump or the wall climbing vine) that halt progression (if I am incorrect with this, I accept the possibility that I may just be an idiot). There were instances where mini bosses, who are in there own rooms, would bug out after parrying (this can be extremely frustrating having to backtrack back to the boss and any semblance of progress is loss. Not to mention these mini bosses can be tough, forcing you to replay the instance several times over). DO NOT GET ME STARTED ON SOME OF THE PARRYING. Call me a bad gamer but I don't know what estranged Spanish saint I have to pray to but Christ theirs some bosses that are absolutely broken. It all just feels some what...clunky? 

Long story short: Not as good as Hollow Knight. Fun game, SHITTY to complete.

The moment to moment gameplay feels great, navigating the world, uncovering its secrets, and fighting bosses is intensely satisfying, with the religious imagery of Spanish Roman Catholicism tying it together. 

A couple poor design decisions mar the experience. There's a fair amount of platforming in the game, all of which features spikes and endless pits that insta-kill the player. This results in a death screen, load screen, and then walking back to the platforming section to try again. This very easily could have been replaced with a quick respawn and some health lost. This is especially apparent in one of the DLC quests with Castlevania crossovers. Being a veteran platformer player, I enjoyed these lengthy speedrun challenges, but they definitely felt out of place. 

The second issue is more deep-seated. Several points in the game lock you out of content and bosses. In order to see everything Blasphemous has to offer, you must do atleast 2 playthroughs. Normally, this would be no issue, but the length of Blasphemous and the nature of its unlockables left me with a sour taste upon seeing this. There are a few other quests that have hidden triggers for progression, which will lock you out of happy endings and Achievements if you are interested in that. 

I didn't have it in me to do a second playthrough of Blasphemous, but for those up for it, it offers plenty of new content, story, secrets, and unlockables. The continued support in the form of small DLC packages helped make Blasphemous into a more complete experience.

Also want to add that, and I'm just reading, but -SPOILER- there is a secret ending, for which you absolutely must read a walkthrough, otherwise you will miss it, because it asks you to play in a very deliberate and stupid way, and no other Metroidvania or Soulslike has ever made you do this kind of shit.

Awesome game, love the theme, the concept the whole thing but it is hard, like Sisyphos hard.
As an old Metroidvania player since the dark ages, I feel familiar and a bit comfortable until I realize this is a game that touches the OG Castlevania level of difficulty. After exploring and poking and smacking around, getting tons of very holy items and equipping myself with everything extremely holy and sacrosanct until I felt extremely saintly with a sword, I managed to delve further into the sins of the inhabitants and remove that said sin with the help of mea culpa and a little bit of force. The creativity of this game and the obvious catholic inspiration is so much fun to explore, everything from visuals to sound and music to the lore.

However, it is a very difficult game, that does get a little bit easier down the road when you get used to it, explore and find power-ups and equip yourself with some of the items you'll find. Still hard despite that, and you better get good with the controllers and enroll in a plat-former boot-camp to improve your reaction time. 

In short, it's a game made by sadists, for masochists.

[h3]Some Good Points[/h3]

[b]Music[/b] - Love it, beautiful iberian themed music, you can feel the Inquisition around the corner.
[b]Sound[/b] - I actually find it well put together - it feels right most of the SFX effects and work with the overall theme.
[b]2D graphic design[/b] - Absolutely fantastic I loved every inch of the game world's graphical design and all the characters as well!
[b]Content[/b] - absolutely enough for the price-tag, for sure. Some of it is good, some is better and some of it should've been thrown into a dumpster fire while in concept stage of their design ... imho (see below)
[b]Difficulty[/b] - It is very difficult and very much so in the beginning until you gradually learn how to play the game and avoid some dangers, handle the controls and how to deal with some enemies. I can say for sure I'm not the best platformer player, and I struggle with some bosses so I won't be able to beat some of them without flasks, for now. I don't know how many times I've died (least hundreds of times for sure) in the game and how many times I simply quit the game in the mid of it and had to do something positive to counterbalance the frustration.
[b]Creativity[/b] - I'd say it is exceptional, it is so fun to take it all in visually and audio-visually the whole game, the story is absurd as well but the fun part is that people really were nuts back then when it came to the whole sin-concept going into overdrive in Catholicism (especially).

[h3]Some Less Good Points[/h3]

[b]Quest Design[/b] - Really convoluted and obscure. I ending up checking a guide because I got stuck and it took too much time to keep running around and around not understanding the triggers of some of the quests, and yes I was right they were really convoluted.

[b]Glitches & Bugs[/b] - There are some moments albeit very rare the player char is stuck for some reason or can't dodge (end-game areas), thought my controller was bad but no it was an in-game glitch. There are also icons not displaying properly in the map, particularly the blood fountain in the second last area.

[b]Genre Content[/b] The Strife & Ruin content is something I'm not happy about since it is a type of a genre that I don't like playing, it wasn't what i wanted when I bought the game but it isn't game breaking to skip it, however it annoys the hell out of me since it locks me out from getting a full completion of the game. If I want to elevate my stress levels and enjoy masochism then I work double-shift while being screamed at, then play Meatboy while blindfolded and have my bare feet pressed on sharp glass shards while playing a recording with someone hating you non-stop on 150% volume after work, and no food or water. 
Not sit through another 2-3 hours TRYING to get the two last pieces by clearing the death-trap courses within given time. I hope it isn't in the sequel, seriously I pray to the Miracle it isn't, otherwise I'll skip buying it.

= = = = = =

[h2]Summary[/h2]

Buy it without a doubt, but be mentally prepared, have a sturdy controller of at least Nokia quality and an anger-management tool ready beside you and be ready to accept you'll have to skip content so you don't lose sanity.

Game made by the Inquisition on steroids - I give this game 38 out of 38 Cherubs

Blasphemous is a game I got enough out of I'd feel bad giving a thumbs down for, but I'd give a thumbs in the middle if I could.

I really enjoyed the games combat, especially the parry system made dodging and timings for boss fights and enemies fun. I typically find enemies in games more annoying than fun, so the fact that Blasphemous made me enjoy fighting and learning them is a huge plus. (Though some enemies were really annoying to fight)
There were 3 bosses I really liked, 2 I thought were good, and then the rest were kinda forgettable/mid (Final boss kinda sucks). This was the highlight of the game, though even with the bosses I thought were really good I felt like I was put into situations I just couldn't dodge. But for the most part I really liked the difficulty.

I really wasn't a fan of the exploration of the game. I went 15 hours not finding a single ability, just waiting to find the one ability that clearly every single path was locked behind, just for it to be locked behind some weird convoluted quest I had to be told how to do AFTER I already beat the game. Making the majority of the game just feel like I was just mapping out dead ends with no real reward the entire game. Because I was locked out of most of the map until after finishing the game and had to look up every single ability, everything just felt like some clean up fetch quest that just took all the fun out of the metroidvania exploration for me, that eventually I just gave up trying to find most of the stuff because it was basically meaningless at that point. The map is also really big and most areas just felt kinda pointless to fight your way through because bosses were so spread out and you rarely find something useful.

Unlike most metroidvania's the abilities are also not anything the player can actually use like a movement ability or something, they just spawn platforms and walls, or just immunity to some hazard so you can go through an area. Basically just keys to a door with lack of player interaction. Which makes it especially confusing as to why you can only have 3 equipped at a time? Just made it so when I saw something I could interact with I had to go into the menu and change what I was wearing for that room to interact with it. 

Spikes and pits killing you instantly (which you usually fall into because you just walked into a room or they're off screen) are extremely annoying and made exploration especially tedious at some points. 

Fast travel in the game is very tedious with how spread out it is. You do get an upgrade for this hidden behind some random donation that doesn't tell you what it does or how much it takes, or even how much you've put in. This is where the most important upgrades in the game are hidden behind. 

There are many side quests you can get locked out of if you don't follow the very strict requirements and look up exactly what to do before ever progressing which can lock you out of certain upgrades which is really lame. 

There's also an INSANE amount of money grinding if you want to get all the upgrades, because stuff costs way too much for how much money you get by just playing casually.

There are 5 dedicated platforming segments and they are horrendously awful. They're speed challenges with no control over how fast you can go due to just waiting for really slow cycles to carry you over to the next platform. On top of which the last couple are really long, and an attempt is over in an instant because falling into spikes 1 shots you.

I encountered a bunch of small little bugs here and there, mostly graphical, a couple that just made me fall through the ground and died when I shouldn't have, or where I lost horizontal control of my character, or just fell through a platform I clearly landed on. Only really effected game-play during the already awful platform sections. 

Though it clearly had a lot of work into it, which I appreciate, I gave up pretty quickly trying to understand the story, there was just wayyy too much reading that's in old English, that was too difficult for me to really decipher, and would have just taken too much time away from actually playing the game. I also don't like this kind of setting, but that's just me. This is by no means a bad thing, I know some people love super cryptic hard to understand story; I do to some extent but not on this level. 

The Art and Music are both incredible, clearly a lot of work was put into the atmosphere of this game.

Apparently the best parts of the game are locked behind a new game plus cycle but I seriously don't feel like replaying the whole game.

Overall: the systems and progression in the game were just way too confusing and hidden, there were some fun bosses and enemies. Looking forward to how the next game improves.",1695194779,1695196262,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

But it's also quick to put you right back into the action. It's got lots of good music, the I love the whole atmosphere of the game, and unlocking more abilities to become even more badass. 

I picked up this game mostly because of a trailer I saw with Miriam from Ritual of the Night: Bloodstained in it, and then that had me looking up details of this game. I was excited to see it's exactly what I was after in a metroid-vania type game. Custom style for combat, hidden areas and plenty of backtracking. It's not incredibly long, but that's fine. I'm about to try new game plus, which I hear has additional content not accessible in the first playthrough.

Edit: 2023

Glad I put the game down instead of playing through NG+ right away! They added a final DLC with the ""true"" ending and I was glad to get a bunch of things completed all at once! ...Though I did lock myself out of conditions for the true ending a few times, and had to start over on a fresh playthrough. That was annoying, but also mostly my fault as I was just having fun exploring and did things a little eagerly. 

The game's so solid, the gameplay feels so good, the whole reason I even picked it up again was because I wanted to see the latest ending before I even looked at anything for the sequel! And now that's done, I've got my eyes on it >.>",1615320367,1695168222,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Blasphemous. The game that I bought and immediately forgot about a thousand years ago. The game that I didn't expect much from upon my return, but ended up having a whole lot of fun. 

I never considered myself a hardcore fan of the Metroidvania genre: for various reasons, I couldn't beat Hollow Knight and Ori, and the more ""classic"" games like Bloodstained didn't click with me at all. However, this game sucked me in literally an hour after starting, and didn't let go until the very (true) ending.

🟢 [b]Well-Paced Exploration[/b]
Amazingly smooth difficulty curve combined with the non-linearity of the world and abundance of secrets, from items to entire locations, provides an extremely enjoyable gaming experience. 

Character stat progression is absent in the game at all, and currency is spent on rare weapon upgrades and potions. In the case of potions, there is a permanent loss of one for each upgrade. Cool decision, design-wise. 

The meta elements here are quite interesting, as the most useful upgrade the player receives is obtained through donating currency at a local church, which, upon reaching a certain threshold, grants the most convenient fast travel in the game. Although initially, it may seem that these donations are pure flavor.

🟢 [b]Awesome Combat[/b]
The combat system is simple and quite intuitive. In most cases, opponents — regular mobs and bosses alike — are perfectly readable. Their animations are clear and well-optimized, with precise timing that allows the player to parry or dodge in time. 

I would also like to mention the boss fights. In the worst cases, they are... pretty standard. In the best cases, they are astonishing. I swear, I will remember Sierpes and Crisanta for a long time. Especially the latter’s second phase which is mostly based on perfect parrying.

🟢 [b]Lore & Aesthetics[/b]
The reason for my return to Blasphemous was its absolutely unique style, which is emphasized by an intricate and complex story with Spanish cultural and religious references. The imagery is so cool that it stays in my mind long after I close the game. And it will stay, I’m certain of it.

All of this is conveyed through pixel art. As a simple human being, I love pixel art. I draw pixel art. I am inspired by it. Here it is of high quality only. Some backgrounds are begging to be used as wallpapers. And certain music tracks will definitely make it into my playlist and serve as background music for role-playing games.

🟡 [b]Well, Platforming[/b]
To me, the only problem this game has. And it is highly subjective. The only thing to ever compete with the bosses is… iron spikes. Carefully placed literally everywhere, they are ready to annihilate you the moment your reflexes go numb for a single second. And considering how much jumping this game offers… 

However, suffering is the way. The Souls series told us.",1695159948,1695159948,True,2,0,0.519685029983520508,0,True,False,False

The story is the usual having to read item descriptions and the like but you get enough from cutscenes and dialogue to get the basic gist of it.

I would advise to take a peak at the wiki before leaving an area to make sure you haven't missed anything and to save you the hassle of trial and error for NPC quests. New Game+ is in this game which has a new quest (leading to a third ending), new bosses and three challenges you can enable which each give a unique reward.

All in all it got multiple free DLCs after the initial release with the final one adding the ending which leads into it's sequel. I couldn't have asked more for my money and am very happy with this game, it's not perfect and can be frustrating at times but it's a solid 8/10 and a great time.

The pixel art and animations are incredibly detailed and excellent and the voice acting is also very good. A lot of effort went into making this a pretty fun game.

However, I can think of a few things I'd like to see changed for improved QoL:

  - Some of the relics should be equipped by default. There's no reason to have to waste a 
    slot/pause and switch just to be able to talk to the dead or be immune to poison.

  - Names and descriptions should be simplified. Extreme verbosity is part of the world but it's 
    a pain to have to sift through so much cruft to find out an item gives you increased health.

  - Checkpoints in the Miriam platforming sections would be nice because falling into instant 
    death spikes feels unfair considering how awful the ladder hit boxes can be here.

The Pros:
-The environment and art design is pretty cool, with some unique character concepts. 
-Thematic music and character voice acting
-A cool-looking level up and upgrade system that seems to naturally scale. 
-Some fun bosses each with unique mechanics

The cons:
-The platforming just sucks. It is absolutely atrocious. The wall-jumping mechanics are the weirdest I've ever experienced. In order to jump ""up"" the wall, you have to jump up, out, and back in in a crazy arc. Jumping from ladder to ladder is brutal; there's an almost full second delay from where you press 'up' and your character actually grabs on to the ladder. 

-Level design is pretty poor. There're either no save points anywhere or three save points all clustered together in one spot, making each one kind of useless. So when you inevitably die far away from one when doing some exploring, it's just absolutely brutal to have to go all the way back through trap-valley to try and collect your dead body. 

-The traps placed, while unique, are often brutal with janky hit frames. The spikes in this game are the absolute worst. If even your pinkie toe touches the spikes, your character suddenly teleports to an impaled state. 


I'll probably finish the game if I get the time, just because I spent the money on it. But yeah, wouldn't recommend. The gameplay mechanics just suck. They're clunky and obviously need refinement.

Update: My above review stands as is. I'm reaching the end and the platforming is just the worst. They're not trying to make it difficult, they're just trying to be annoying and kill you. Floors crumble out of nowhere and lead to spike pits, every improper jump is punished with an insta-kill spike pit.

The story of the game was very mysterious and interesting and pulled me to the end of the game to unravel the mysteries, the art design and pixel art graphics are really well done, the characters and modeling may not be to everyone's taste, But I loved them, the music and voice acting fits the world and atmosphere of the game well and is enjoyable.

As for the gameplay, the creators have done well and made the movements and animations very good. For me, who had little experience in this genre of games, the game had a fairly balanced degree of difficulty, which, of course, became easier by upgrading and finding useful items, and I did not see any annoying problems in this regard.

Overall Blasphemus is a worthy game in this genre and I suggest you give it a try.

I take my hat off to everyone in The Game Kitchen, they achieved something that even big companies cannot reach. Blasphemous is not just another Souls Like or another 2D platform game, it offers a unique story with great voice acting which delivers the best experience one can imagine.
I bought the game about 1 or 2 years ago and I couldn't give it time cause it is really hard and unforgiving, but when you upgrade your sword and your health then the game becomes fun, so give it time and love. all in all, 20/10.

Story: Magnificent,,[spoiler] There are 3 endings, ending A and B and also a true ending. [/spoiler]

Music: Immersive, loving and horrifying at the same time.
Game Play: Hard and Unforgiving, even if you are a seasoned Blasphemous player you will struggle at the beginning of the game.
Voice Acting: The Best, I always thought to myself that these 2D games, need soul, and The Game Kitchen found it and did it.

Though the game felt frustrating at the start of it all, once you get to learn to understand the mechanics and the importance of backtracking, you will be well on your way to being the ultimate Penitent One. 

[h2] The Story & World [/h2]

The story was quite solid in it's execution, going for a more dark souls like way of telling the story rather than telling you exactly what happens. In a way, it kept me well engaged. Many metroidvania games exceed at creating such unique worlds and Blasphemous doesn't disappoint in this regard, being heavily inspired by Spanish Religion, you will be going through many churches that all feel unique, in addition to snowy mountain plains, desolate hellish undergrounds, a toxic sewerage system or a ghastly Library. This is all accompanied by an amazing OST to represent the world/boss. Connected level design is also another positive thing about these types of games, providing ease of access to the player as a reward to prevent tedious linear backtracking. 

[h2] Gameplay & Progression [/h2]

How does the gamplay hold up? well as I mentioned before, it is truly a challenging game, every enemy you encounter after the Holy Line is unique with it's own attack patterns and behaviour with a total of 37 unique encounters (not including the bosses). Some enemies are stronger variants of each other (such as Acolytes) but all in all are unique to the area you are fighting them in. You will die a lot if you do not learn about the encounter or study the attack patterns of the enemies. By learning about what each enemy does within the encounter, you will have a better chance at succeeding and dying less. That being said, there is going to be a time where certain rooms filled with certain enemies can frustrate you and perseverance is the only answer.

The Penitent One has a decent array of movesets with his sword the Mea Culpa from a uppercut slash, a slow but powerful ground twirl, a plunge attack, a charged attack, ranged blood projectiles and a powerful dash lunge which can setup for perfect executions which are all satisfying to pull off. Along with upgrading your moveset, you can upgrade your healing items (as in the amount you can obtain/amount you can heal). Parrying and Dashing are your defence mechanics but iframes are not that frequent especially in boss fights, relying on reading the patterns of the boss you are fighting. All the bosses are unique to fight and range from powerful warriors to abominations. 

Progressing the game in order to become more powerful is tied to the world itself and exploring it deeply for secrets. You can obtain tears of atonement which is currency earned through killing mobs/bosses and progressing quest lines. By unlocking relics, they can help open new paths to explore and further expand your arsenal, such as and is not limited too: health upgrades, fervour upgrades, rosary knots/beads to give buffs/defences for certain scenarios, Hearts for your sword which will provide a huge buff along with a debuff, prayers and consume fervour to unleash powerful buffs, defences or attacks, collecting bones that unlock a new boss and cosmetic and finally finding Children of Moonlight to track down. 

[h2] Replayability [/h2]

After I was able to 100% my New Game file, the only thing left to do was play True Torment (NG+) which resets all of your progress while retaining most of the stuff you found already in that file. In NG+ as expected, you will fight enemies that are stronger and deal more damage but in return you earn more tears to make the grind less tedious and elongated. In addition you get 3 traits to choose from. Red turns the game into an old school side platformer where instead of a health bar, you get health orbs, which can help with annoying boss fights/traps/enemies. The Blue one weakens your sword attacks by half but allow your fervour to regenerate passively rather than having to earn it through attacks only. Finally the black one turns the game into dark souls in a sense where if you die, you lose all of your currency, cant use prayers and have to collect the guilt where you died and your flasks no longer heal health but fervour, making for a more punishing playthough but a good challenge nonetheless. by beating the game with each trait, you will unlock a new bead/skin. 

In addition to NG+, there is new content to play, such as fighting 4 skeletal bosses each with a unique weapon that has a unique attack pattern all to progress to a final boss that uses all 4, testing your skills and knowledge on the bosses you fought prior. A new ending is also unlocked where you have to explore the new areas to find it, as well as paying attention to the NPCs you encounter. Thee there is content is one I personally dislike as they are platforming challenges and that is the Strife and Ruin which was a collaboration with the Bloodstained series protagonist Miriam, as I found it to show a lot of the frustrating parts of the platforming in this game when presented as a challenge but thankfully that is just optional and you get a decent prayer as a reward so up to you.

Once you are done exploring all of the base game, you can challenge the bosses again in a progressive style known as Sacred Sorrows which will rank you based on many things and serves as a challenge.

Overall, I enjoyed my time with Blasphemous, so much to the point I wanted to 100% this games achievements and I'm glad I did, It provides a satisfying gameplay loop, allowing the player to discover a unique world where they are rewarded for paying attention to the little details and explore every nook and cranny to further progress the penitent one to become stronger than ever. A vast array of beads, prayers and hearts allow for extensive customisation and variety, all wrapped together with a story that is mysterious but extensive. Awelcome addition to action metroidvania games.

There are some video games that can be easily said that they go beyond being the source of entertainment. That they reach further, into the field of a fine work of art. One of those games is definitely Blasphemous. Astounding atmosphere and lore, coated with totally beautiful and detailed pixel-art graphic and climatic music, both fitting the in-game world they represent and portray.

This could be enough to classify Blasphemous as a work of art, but one mustn't forget about something equally important as the things I mentioned earlier, which is gameplay and everything surrounding it. It is as polished as the audiovisual side of this game, meaning that we have a lot of abilities and combos to perform, challenging bosses to defeat, various platforming sequences to go through. Level design is superb and, combined with a minimap allowing to put markers etc. on it, makes a player accustomed to the whole area they are currently in.

Cherry on the top are achievements. They are fair, rewarding, and definitely doable. Some of them are easier to get, some are harder, but with enough practice getting 100% achievements doesn't seem like an impossible task at all.

Any cons? Sometimes it's not clear, at least on a first glance, what to do exactly to reach a particular ending or finish a quest, often bound to an achievement. It's a minor inconvenience, in my opinion. It might seem annoying at times, but doesn't take the joy of playing this game. At least it did not in my case.

I definitely recommend Blasphemous. As a fan of the metroidvania genre, playing it was truly a gaming feast and pure pleasure.",1694330770,1694424613,True,14,0,0.677870333194732666,0,True,False,False

This game is soo good, but it does a HORRIBLE job at telling you where to go and where to get absolutely crucial items from. I'm so mad that after spending 20 hours and already on the NG+ I still hadnt got the bloody sand. Like I was so mad cause I got so stuck with nowhere to go that I figured ""well, maybe after I kill the final boss the new zones unlock and he gives me the thing to activate the red dots and the golden roots"" well no my dude, after spending 10+ hours on the huge map it turns out you have to go to the tutorial part of the game to open a door which inside is the thing you will yell at for the entire game if you dont have it. So yeah, I had to look up a guide to find the last statue to destroy for the good ending, which needs the bloody sand, which made me want to look out for it in the ENTIRE map, just for it to be in the tutorial part of the game. Also you need to destroy statues for an ending and thats really not apparent either.
Other thing that ruined my experience was being able to just not see Redento in the second part of the garden, like, I only found him and could end his quest because I started jumping from every cliff possible looking for the blood sand, turns out he gave the item thats needed for jumping on slimy floor.
As you can see im so angry for wasting so much time looking for that one stupid thing, doing all side quests by proxy, getting stuck having looked at *literally* every room, found the arcade and most oil mana things before the blood sand and even got to NG+ getting stuck again.

[h1] Disclaimer for those in India [/h1]
DO NOT BUY THIS GAME at its current price. If you check steam's price history, Blasphemous saw a roughly 350% increase in its price, putting it at just about on par with the American USD rate. This is ridiculous as far as regional pricing goes and the game most definitely is NOT worth the current amount of Rs. 1999 (as of Sept. 2023). Buy this game when it's on heavy discount, if at all. Otherwise, just go for something else.

[h3] Ok, game review [/h3]
I could not bring myself to finish this game, there just was not enough of a motive for me to keep playing. I got to around the final boss and though I did have some late game stuff left to explore, I couldn't muster the enthusiasm to invest time into it.

[h3] The Good Stuff [/h3]
The art style is beautiful, especially the creature and character designs. If you're someone who is a fan of gore and just super weird shit, then you're gonna at least have a good time staring at your screen. The environment design ranges from fine to amazing, but the creature designs are definitely what stands out the most. Blasphemous's art is heavily rooted in religious iconography most notably taken from Christianity and it plays around with that concept in some extremely gruesome ways.

The sound design is what really carried the experience for me. It is so good. The OS, combat sounds, creature sounds, and just about everything is top-notch and really helps to immerse in Blasphemous' weird universe.

[h3] The Bad [/h3]
The game tries too damn hard to be edgy, it's gory, gruesome, biblical, and weird, and it'll beat you over the head with it. 

Also why would you use a Blackletter font for a pixel art game?? I get why it was used thematically, but it just made reading item descriptions such a chore, especially considering a lot of the terms are very specific to just Blasphemous. I often misread many words and mostly could not be bothered with reading more than two lines or until I understood what the item did in-game.

The combat and platforming were by far the weakest aspects of the game for me, the combat is just fine when it comes to the regular enemies, other than a few of the enemies which just bring the gameplay down to a halt and sometimes require you to simply tank hits. The boss fights were just okay, I think it took me only about 2-3 tries for most bosses, though some of the late-game boss fights were A LOT better than those in the early to mid-game.

The platforming is my main gripe with this game as the tools given offer such a poor experience while traversing the levels and a majority of this game requires you to traverse large distances to get anywhere. I don't think I enjoyed even a single instance of platforming. A lot of the ledges you need to jump to are also this 2.5D thing which made it confusing to know when you've actually landed on something. There is no flow to the character's movement.

[h1] In Conclusion [/h1]
I had a little bit of fun playing Blasphemous, it would have been an okay experience were it not for the awful platforming. The game progression is also way too obscure and half the time you don't even know where you're supposed to go. It's somehow like Dark Souls 1 but without the beautiful world, lore, and characters. If you're looking for a similar experience to this then I'd suggest Ender Lilies, Ori, Hollow Knight, Dead Cells, Salt and Sanctuary, Shovel Knight, Furi, Katana Zero. Though Blasphemous is a competently made game, I had a lot more of an enjoyable experience playing these other game.",1694342786,1694343273,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While difficulty is the name of the game for soulslike and exploration/world connection is the same for metroidvanias this one falls short in that the difficulty is placed almost completely on the clunkiness of the character. The dash most of the time places you into the hitbox of the enemy you are trying to dash stab, and to not attempt a dash stab and get a execute is essentially wasting time. The obstacles are almost unavoidable at certain points in the game so you are bound to get damaged from SOMETHING. Getting hit from an enemy that walks into you is absolutely frustrating, and you cant dash past most enemies that you feel like you should be able to. A handful of the boss fights are ok, but ok at best. There is no flow, and many times the obstacles require you to wait an excruciatingly long time (looking at the fog clouds in the tower). The parry is ok, but parrying larger enemies leaves you staggered, knocks you back a bit, and does not reward you in the slightest, so whats the point?

The story the story some how makes Fromsoftware's video game stories as coherent as a children's book. You'll have NPCs spouting terms and events that make no sense in what your'e trying to do in the game, so if story telling is your thing, and you're not into figuring out what the heck went down, this game isn't for you. Also brief aside of the story, ending C, the game's canon ending that apparently leads into the events of the sequel, is missable and missing it requires you to start over or play New Game Plus, but the latter is recommended due to a few bosses in the game are exclusive to New Game Plus. 

Too many of the upgrades are too far off the beaten path and require the usual affair of not being able to access them until you get a tool to reach them, but you get these tools so late that you'll forget about them unless you remember to mark them on your map to come back later. If you expect the game to hand you upgrades, the ones that the game naturally gives you, or the ones that you can immediately get as soon as you stray off the beaten path is minimal. I ended the game with like two magical abilities (Prayers) and one or two passive abilities (Hearts). So don't expect to have that many toys to play with unless you either take the time to go back every now and then to look for them when you get a new traversal tool, look them up, or play New Game Plus since all traversal tools that you unlock (some are optional, but required to get certain items and abilities) are carried over, so you can just go to every side path and get nearly everything in the game.

FInally, the movement and platforming is a bit clunky, not the most terrible thing I've played, but it feels a little jank at times. 

With all those caveats out of the way, the combat is fun, parrying feels very good, and presents a fair challenge. The design of the enemies are cool especially the bosses. Environments are cool as well, even though a bit boring sometimes (looking at you Jundo).

Blasphemous is rough around the edges in terms of story, upgrade progression, and movement, but if you can get passed that, then I recommend you give it a try.",1694200409,1694200409,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is awfully badly paced, the easiest bosses come last, you have to use viridiana for an achievement so just use her as soon as possible. Final boss has no telegraphs.

Achievement for 100% is locked behind also completing some random DLC sidequest which is just about the dumbest thing... You can tell a lot of love went into this game, just not in the areas that matter.

Today was the last drop. I wanted to like this game, really did. But these beginner game developer/designer mistakes are simply intolerable.

1) Not all the controls are taught to you through-out the course of the game. When you pick up and item and want to read the description of it to determine whether it's worth equiping or not, sometimes the part of the description that's important is off-screen. If you want to read that part, you'll have to know how to scroll that description. Hint: scroll-wheel does NOT work. Oh and if you wanted to check the controls mid-game?

2) There is no pause menu, no settings menu, you have no ability to adjust anything regarding the game while you're in-game, only in the start-up screen. Want to adjust the audio? Restart the game. Video settings? Restart the game. Check or change controls? Re. Start. The. Game. Alternatively you have to alt-tab out of the game to google the controls.

3) Speaking of alt-tabbing, don't. The game does NOT care whether it's in focus or not. It will continue to accept input even if another application is in the foreground and focused. This means that if you alt-tab to write a message to your friend or type anything anywhere, some of those letters you're typing may be accepted by the game as input. In my case, which is today's last drop, I started up the game, and while waiting for it to load (which takes absolute ages given the relatively tiny size of the game) I was chatting. The game accepted those inputs, navigated to the game save menu AND DELETED MY ENTIRE PROGRESS.

Aside from the meta problems above, the gameplay is okay for the most part. I'll just point out a couple of them that negatively stood out.

4) Mechanics seems to be misnamed or just poorly implemented sometimes, specifically parry. It's not really a parry, it's a block. For all the encounters I've had in the game (about 25% in) there were only 2 enemies against which there was an actual parry response, everywhere else it's just a block. Misnomer at best but still slightly annoying.

4.1) More nails in the coffin for parry, it has basically no place in this game. The timing window for some attacks seem intuitive but when you use that same intuition for other attacks, it just let's the attack through either before you even take the parry stance. You simply have to get hit or die a couple of times to memorize the timing window for each parriable attack, but still annoying. In any case, there's almost no point in using this instead of dashing behind the enemy whenever possible, you'll probably forget you even have this ability.

5) Sluggish controls in general. There's no chaining or cancelling actions. There seems to be a cooldown a little bit after almost every action you can take during which you may not start another action. Pacing of the game strongly focuses on the platforming, for which the deficiencies the controls have are most apparent (and abhorent). For some this might be the ""real"" experience, to me this is just annoying.

6) The hitboxes are completely broken. There's just no regard to what is shown to you on screen. Oh a projectile flew 2 player character heights above you? Yea that hit you. A lazer passes through you? Nah you're good fam.

But it's okay guys, the dev included like 4 completely redundant CRT shaders taken from their first course on how to write shaders or stolen from shadertoy! No seriously, some good things about this game: The bosses and puzzles are fun, the pixel art is lovely, sound design is good and the story is enjoyable. I'll keep playing the game for those reasons alone, despite all the issues I listed, simply because it's a good enough experience to be worth the trouble (once you've been made aware of the broken-ness and can effectively avoid it, that is). It is however NOT anywhere near worth 25 USD or EUR. At most this could be a 10 dollar game, and that's pushing it. I got it for 6.50 that's the only reason this game didn't immediately get refunded. It's not just unpolished, it's unfinished. This should be a private alpha, not a release for 25 bucks.",1693033240,1694144341,False,1,0,0.486432552337646484,1,True,False,False

Combat never felt unfair. There are many tools at your disposal to use against the variety of common enemies - equipment, prayers (basically spells), plus the different ways to use your sword. All the boss fights felt unique which is a plus. They really test your understanding of the combat and movement system.

Only complaint I have is with the jumping puzzles as the hitboxes of the spike pits are a bit wider than they should be. Dying just by being next to them was a major source of frustration.

[list][*]Good level design.

The Profane: 
[list][*]A couple of important progression items require very convoluted steps to find.
[*]Some encounters trigger during very specific windows of opportunity that can be missed. There are at least two situations where accepting or equipping an item is irreversible, which locks you out of completing certain objectives.
[*]Some objects have weird hit boxes. Ladders can be tricky to grab while jumping and to avoid grabbing during combat.[/list]

Final Judgement: 

Blasphemous is worthy of its positive ratings. Like any successful Metroidvania its level progression is fun and complex, with plenty of secrets to uncover. Boss fights are simple but challenging, though not as punishing as Hollow Knight or Souls games, which I personally appreciate. Combat is pretty standard: mostly hack n' slash with some semi-useful prayer spells that I frequently forgot to use.

The OST is quite wonderful, as is the voice acting. The difficulty is considerable, but not too unreasonable if you have some experience with games like this.

The storytelling/worldbuilding is so incredibly souls-esque which could be good or bad depending on your taste -- while the world is immersive, the narrative can get a bit confusing at times, especially if you don't pay attention to all the details.

This is by far my favorite metroidvania and one of my favorite games of all time. It easily has the best integration of dark souls elements with a 2d metroidvania. It hits the right spot of atmosphere, difficulty, and no hand holding. The art style is iconic and foreboding. The difficulty is high at times but often gives you other challenges so you can later return where you're struggling. There is no quest log telling you what to do but the game allows you to mark out your map so you can figure out quests for yourself. NG+ also adds ""penances"" which change how you approach playing the game.

Overall I completely recommend this game and would say to not play the sequel as it feels like a watered down experience that lacks the atmosphere and difficulty that makes this game great",1693824233,1693824233,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Actually it's pretty good. 
Art direction is amazing.
Sound design and music is great.
Level design feels a little disjointed.  Go through a door and your in a whole different zone. No lead up to so it can be a little jarring. 
So why am I giving it a negative review?
The controls are terrible.
Everything feels clunky. Movement feels sluggish, jumping has no real momentum and ledge grabbing is a 50/50 chance of grabbing when you want and a 100% chance of grabbing when you don't.
And ladders... wow. Ladders are the most frustrating thing in this game.
I got to this point where I spent 45 minutes trying to get past the same spot since you have to jump from one ladder to another and since it's so janky I just fall into a spike trap and die.
Now the first few times I can blame myself. User error.
But again and again and again I would die in the exact same spot and at some  point you have to start thinking that it's the game.
After looking it up too see if I was just bad it turns out that this is a complaint from many people going back two years.
If Team17 tightened the controls and fixed the issues with the ladders I could recommend Blasphemous but right now it's more frustrating then fun.

Edit*
Decided to give it another go since the second game has just been released and man this game really annoyed me to no end.
Controls have been worked on it seems and I didn't have a lot of issues with ladders and ledges even though it's still janky sometimes.
My issues is with items and quests.
There is no direction with these ""quest"" items and it's so convoluted for no reason. 
It doesn't make the developers smart and it just comes off as try hard.
I got so annoyed I just alt+F4'ed and took it off my hard drive.
Even looking at the wiki it's convoluted.
For example.

There are these vines around the world so obviously I need an item to activate them.
To get said item these are the steps.
Get the Black Grieving Veil.
Get the Torn Bridal Ribbon.
Get the Melted Golden Coins.
Then find the the big hairy egg. (Not a joke it's an actual big hairy egg)
Place the items and get the Egg of Deformity.
Then go to a tree where you fought Perpetva and place the egg.
Leave the area and come back to get the Hatched Egg of Deformity.
Then take the egg to the statue in the lake of silence to bless it and get the item to grow the vines.
What the actual eff...
If I didn't look it up I would never have figured this out. 

The place with the black egg just has plates on the floor with no clear indication as to what goes there. Am I supposed to go back when ever I pick up an item?
The only thing I think I would have pieced together would be the actual egg.

Look I don't like hand holding in games and can figure most things out on my own but when it's something like this I just can't wrap my head around how this was approved.
Obviously Blasphemous is not for me but I still don't recommend this to anyone.",1627564814,1693797409,False,2,0,0.495412856340408325,0,True,False,False

This game has great lore and worldbuilding, and a significant number of glaring fundamental issues. The combat is pretty decent, but it is hampered by mediocre hitboxes and gameplay issues. This game heavily relies on artificial difficulty, where they increase the number of enemies or the number of environmental hazards in an area to make it harder. There are also enemies in a later area that spawn out of thin air and can spawn directly on your character, making you take free damage from an enemy that you cannot even see. Similarly, the boss encounters are incredibly weak imo. Most bosses have a very small moveset of 3-4 moves that they relentlessly spam and later in the encounter, the bosses will just increase how quickly they use this repetitive moveset. It makes most fights very boring and while most bosses are very well-designed, their fights don't have the same effect. One simple gameplay mechanic that frustrated me to hell was the fact that your character is knocked down when taking damage in most cases. The bosses take advantage of this knockdown by spamming more of their attacks while you're knocked down, which in most cases would be fine, but it seems like the knockdown is an animation lock causing you to not be able to move or parry while you're down. You also will likely need a guide for this game because all of the item descriptions or questlines are incredibly cryptic and its often near impossible to determine what to do with specific quest items. Finally, while lorewise the final boss of the game is interesting, the actual encounter is a massive letdown due to the fight being terribly boring/uninteresting in phase 1 and gimmicky to an extent that it becomes frustrating in phase 2. Overall, I still enjoyed my time with this game, but I think that there are many gameplay aspects that don't feel right and I hope that they are fixed in Blasphemous 2.",1693775359,1693775406,False,4,2,0.536921083927154541,0,True,False,False

Edit: After going back and actually completing the game, I wanted to go over this review again as I felt I was a bit harsh at first. While I do still agree with my original points, I still think this game is worth playing. I think what initially deterred me was that It took me some initial time to get used to the game's mechanics/controls. Your attacks and overall speed are slow, meaning you have to really find these moments inbetween enemy attacks where you can get some hits off. While you can probably get away with not using it, the block/parry is also a large part of combat. If you can time these correct you can get in large amounts of damage by mitigating the amount of time youre trying to dodge things.

Skip forward to the list for the TL;DR

Before making a pros/cons list, I have to express that Blasphemous isn't nor a lot of Dark Souls nor Metroidvania, but it's clearly inspired by either. As I mentioned, the Souls-like vibes are mostly given by the dark fantasy setting, the which is inspired by the Spanish obscurantism (more on that in the digital art book. Highly recommended a read by the way!) and the way we are given no more than a setting and an brief introduction to the land of Custodia, all the other lore is printed on the items for you, it is up to you to have a read or not, the same way you'll have to pay attention to the NPCs quest lines.
It's Metroidvania vibes on the other hand come from the good share of platforming that is the whole game and the wide variety of areas you visit, with that precious background design that truly submerges you into a room despite being printed behind platforms and enemies in a 2D setting, and the numerous secrets you can find with a little intuition, observation and the use of the skills that let you move around the world, although here they are relics that will give you access to those secrets and aren't precisely mandatory for the game.
With those two in mind is where Blasphemous makes its own soul: A wide world of platforms that feels naturally connected between areas, hardcore and rightfully frustrating platforming, combat that requires you to be deliberate and accurate, and a ""two phase story"" that gives you some freedom on how to tackle the game; although it does misses the ""being stuck in a room, find skill to get you unstuck after exploring and finding your way"" that Metroidvanias demand, this is reserved for secrets, and I think it does for the better.

There are plenty of enemies, with one or two attacks each, something I think could be improved but that isn't precisely out of the formulas it takes inspiration from, boss fights are all distinct and unique (Fuck that baby you saw on the trailer though, I hate that thing) and you get a decent amount of techniques to fight with, skills become extensions and upgrades of those but the feeling of repetiveness is scarce, also akin to the games it was inspired by. I'll stop here and go on with the list, what I had to put in words has been said.

Edit DLC-3:
Fuck it, no cons worth even mentioning.

Every upgrade in this game is gated by secrets that can be missed. If you play this game mark your map so you know where to go back from.  The dlc content can be convoluted and it all requires back tracking. Also very little is explained which is ok if the mechanics are intuitive. For the life of me I dont understand why Dark souls like games don't adopt the same system of if you unlock a shrine you can port over there. Stop making porting to shrines something you have to earn! Good grief! PS tithe at the church because it provides considerable upgrades. 

The end bosses/dlc bosses that provide the hardest content are can be a bit cheap and shows the developers honest attempt to recreate dark souls like bosses but what they miss is that in dark souls those bosses have many ways to be beaten. In the game that dynamic is missing and most likely to be said bosses will require you to find secrets to upgrade your character like certain prayers or beads. Or of course you can just git gud and became a no hit player. 

Ultimately I dont like that power level of the character is gated by discovery more than combat and challenging battles. Hopefully they struck a better balance in the sequel. 

In conclusion, a solid game that misses being truly great due to the above design issues. However if you fight the DLC bosses and the ending C bosses and put the work in to discover your power level you will have a great time.  The developers are close to making something special.

The mechanic of sticking to certain walls by your shoving your sword in is great; until you have to do it in combat where you either jump off to hit the enemy and cannot cling back on, or jump off to hit the enemy and your swing sticks you back onto the wall. It is very unintuitive and poorly implemented.

The platforming challenges might as well be ripped straight out of a kaizo Mario hack, only you don't have anything close to the solid Mario mechanics.

 -Art design and animation
-Convincing retro feel to controls. 
- Filters in options for increased authentic retro feel. 

Cons:
 -Poorly Placed Warp points
 -Floor Spikes...ugh
 -Retrieving guilt.... super ugh
 -Healing animation time
 -Knock-back distance and duration from enemy attacks

Overall, an extremely satisfying visual treat. It almost makes up for all the other annoying aspects of the game.... almost.

Instead of inviting me into the world with intriguing descriptions and interesting writing, I'm able to press the ""Lore"" button to read the lore, which is hardly immersive. The world itself isn't bad, and I like the concept of Christian pain and suffering being virtuous; it's great as an aesthetic, but Blasphemous seems to go a step further and make me actually suffer the longer I play.

The art style and animations are beautiful, but the deeper I get into the game, the more tedious it becomes. From the overly methodical combat and wait-move-wait platforming, backtracking quickly becomes a chore. When your inspiration comes from games like Dark Souls, Castlevania and Metroid, replaying the same areas should be engaging every time, or at least less tedious.

Calling the protagonist the Penitent One, will only ever remind me of the Negative One from the Countdown episode of I.T. Crowd, it's spoken with the same tone and cadence. I know a lot of effort went into creating this game, and I remember looking forward to it for at least a year prior to its release, but so much about it seems to have missed the mark for me, and I always come back in an attempt to change my mind, because it does have a lot going for it. But the long-winded npc speeches soon have my eyes glazing over.

Also, prompting me to press any button to continue when I die should include the buttons on the controller I'm using; Needing to press a key on the keyboard while I have a controller in-hand is just one more thing to frustrate me with tedium.

Not gonna lie, the first 1 hour didn't really impress me well. But the more I played (and getting good), it's actually a great game. The combat is quite satisfying once you're used to it. The enemies and environment style is also very great looking. If I'm gonna rate just the content for the main game, it's a solid 7.5/10.

If I have to nitpick something that's not implemented well enough, I would say it's the platforming side quest (or just platforming in general). Although it's not a problem for most of the game because you can probably cheese it with some technique. BUT it's a different matter when talking about the Miriam's side quest. Simply put it's a timed platform challenge. And some levels had actually a moving platform that made you sit on it for a damn long time while it delivers you to a shooting fireballs. At that point it's not even a bullet hell anymore, it's just an HP endurance challenge. Why bother with a timer when you can't avoid a moving platform with 40 seconds of linear path (I don't actually counted it but feels like it). The platform foothold is also very weird, you can clip through the moving platform if you got hit by a fireball. Lastly is probably the lantern dash strike thing (idk what to call it) where the game never gave a tutorial on how to do it, and if you hit the lantern at exactly the handle of the sword it won't even register and you'll just fall to your death. I completed all of it, but didn't get the same sense of accomplishment like other platformers (give me achievement please).

The story is a bit confusing but it kinda reminds me of Dark Souls, telling the lore through item descriptions and such. I really haven't played many Metroidvania games before this one and it honestly didn't disappoint. The progression was challenging but rewarding, the enemies were difficult yet balanced, and the secrets were very well hidden (sometimes so well I needed the wiki). 

But the parkour. Oh my God the parkour. Don't get me started on the platforming. Spike pits that are insta-kill if you even look at them funny. Map hazards with so much knockback it makes it seem like the beatings I get from my drunken father are no more than gusts of wind. Ladders that sometimes just don't even let you climb on them, leading to many, many painfully simple deaths. And sometimes the game just decides that you can't move anymore, so that's fun.

I have more to say but I'll sum up: Do I recommend the game? Yes. Do I like the game's mechanics? Definitely yes. Is exploration fun? See the above paragraph.

Combat has a lot left to be desired, after meeting most enemies and bosses, they're all pretty straight forward and easy to beat. The DLC-boss content added a lot of difficulty to the game which is super nice.

An extremely solid Metroidvania with a beautiful art style, great music, and fluid gameplay. Tons of side quests and extra things on the side to keep you entertained throughout. New game plus and boss rush mode also help extend the play time. If I could describe the gameplay in one word it would be satisfying. The executions are brutal and fun to pull off. The combat is fluid and great. The enemies have great designs and all have different patterns to memorize. The bosses are incredible and are a blast to adapt and conquer. Their designs have a great warped monster feel that intimidate you. All areas of the combat and abilities have great depth and multitudes of options. Barely any complaints other than the game itself being somewhat vague in terms of gameplay and story. Be prepared to look up certain things  as there are a decent amount of stuff that gets overlooked in a first play through, but maybe that’s where the beauty of multiple play throughs  come in. The bosses do seem to come out of nowhere to me and I would’ve liked a little more build up, but that’s just me. The atmosphere and world it tries to build up is intriguing and breathtaking  but they seem to give a lot of questions and it leaves a good bit up to the player for interpretation.  I wanted to know the backstory how everything happened and there was just times I felt I was not being shown as much as I wanted. And while the final boss is great both endings felt slightly underwhelming and too cryptic, which is a fitting word for the story in general. Overall, I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys metroidvanias or a challenging video game with a great style. And while the story is a little too vague for my liking, the pros EASILY outweigh the cons. What’s great is REALLY GREAT and the cons are really just tiny nitpicks that don’t really dampen the experience a lot at all. For the price this game is a no-brainer for the enjoyment you’ll get. I cannot recommend enough.

Art is absolutely stunning. It fits the vibe they were going for perfectly. All monsters I've seen so far are all aesthetically pleasing to the eye and are scaled well difficulty wise. Difficulty scaling of my play through this far has been a breath of fresh air. It's hard, but not so hard that you can't get past it. It isn't too harsh on deaths either which was nice. The bosses I've fought so far have been difficult but not to where I had to give up the game. I'm currently stuck on an optional boss, but if I push myself I can beat her. I honestly think my favorite part about this game has to be the secrets and puzzles. While not being super ground breaking, I loved that some puzzles where placed in earlier areas of the game so then you come back to them, making many areas in the game re-playable which I really enjoyed.

If you don't have any though, it will simply tell you, ""You are rid of guilt."" 

And it just... clicked. The statue in question is in the pose of forgiving you, and somehow my weird brain internalized that. I bowed before the statue, and I am rid of my guilt. You have no idea how good that feels.. Now when I start to feel bad, I close my eyes, and I bow. And I am rid of guilt. 

No more hating myself for stupid little things, no more constant pain in my head. My heart feels so good right now. I can't even describe how amazing and life changing this is. And all from some random little in game moment out of nowhere my weird stupid brain decided to just, keep.

Nice game.

I really liked the design of bosses. As a huge fan of pixels, this game really nailed it. This is a good game don't get me wrong but there are just things that are too frustrating like some of the quest items are too cryptic, the backtracking is awful, 90% of my deaths came from dying to a fucking spikes, the teleport areas are too far. It's impossible to 100% this game without a guide. I wanna love this game but... :3 game is frustratingly hard and not satisfying.

It's a dark and twisted action-platformer that's a feast for fans of challenging gameplay and atmospheric storytelling. Developed by The Game Kitchen, this game immerses you in a macabre world inspired by Spanish folklore and religious imagery.

The first thing that strikes you is the stunning pixel art style. The visuals are incredibly detailed, with intricate animations and beautifully designed environments. Every corner of the game is dripping with grotesque and haunting art that adds to the eerie atmosphere.

Gameplay-wise, Blasphemous delivers tight and responsive controls, which are crucial for a game that demands precision platforming and combat. The combat system offers a satisfying variety of weapons and abilities that can be upgraded and customized to suit your playstyle. The boss battles are particularly noteworthy, offering challenging encounters that require strategy and skill to overcome.

One of the game's strongest aspects is its narrative. Blasphemous tells a cryptic and disturbing story through its world, characters, and collectibles. Every interaction and discovery adds to the lore, leaving players intrigued and hungry for more insight into the game's dark universe.

However, keep in mind that the difficulty level might be a turnoff for some players. The game doesn't hold back in challenging you, often requiring precise timing and execution. This can lead to moments of frustration, but the feeling of accomplishment when you finally conquer a tough section is worth it.

In a nutshell, if you're a fan of challenging action-platformers with a captivating and grim narrative, Blasphemous is right up your alley. The game's stunning art style, tight gameplay, and haunting atmosphere create an experience that's both visually striking and emotionally engaging.

Since the first days of release, when I played it for the first time. The game surprised me too much for its art, atmosphere, soundtrack and especially for the emphasis on the suffering that the characters are in such a complete story.

The game's story comes in bits and pieces. Every NPC you meet gives you something to think about and relate to others who live in the same world. Its conclusion is satisfying as well as the beginning of the game.

The artistic part of the game is impeccable. I recommend everyone who likes pixel art and game direction to acquire the art book for this game. The shorts in which the story is heavier make you imagine how the vision of this world is different from 2D. The in-game combat animations, such as executions and interactions with objects, are one of the best I've ever seen.

The work of the voice actors is good and creates an atmosphere that refers to the story. Of people's suffering.

The combat and movement of the characters is very fluid and that's what made me want to play more than twice and complete the game 100%. Very challenging to beat the second time with the DLC content.

Speaking of them. The game's DLCs are proof that the work with love still exists in some production companies. Especially the Independents who value the quality of the product. Surely the team listened to several players to put more content in the game and in a way that it fits perfectly. The additional content motivates you to put at least ten more hours into the game.

As I haven't had the opportunity to play many Metroidvanias, I can't fully compare it with others. But this one really deserves it and is worth your time and money.",1692328829,1692328829,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

the only flaw i found was that the map is not that good to pinpoynt what area is what. if you take a month of the game and come back you need to disifer the map and scrambled memory to find where that one place was that you need to go. but the map is the only little nitpick i found in the game. and thats becase the world is bigger than you would think.

The enemies disfigured, maimed but somehow still retained beauty. Not to mention Angels. The bosses are a highlight too. Not only are the designs good, but the telegraphs and feel of them was amazing. For this world alone, this game is worth playing. The voice acting is brilliant too. Not one actor stood out as being worse. It feels like the team that made this poured everything they could to make it stand out from its peers, but sadly, I think they could have done more.

Platforming really stands out as being undercooked. You never really get any upgrades except for QoLs like being faster or dashing faster. You don't get a double jump, inversion, speed or something more unique. The gates of this game are mostly held in the Relics. When you obtain one it helps in areas by revealing secret paths. 

Weapon variety is nonexistent. By itself. that isn't a problem, but even the upgrade system leaves a lot to be desired with most upgrades not providing much to the sword except more damage and some basic moves. The 2nd game will remedy this, as has been seen in trailers. 

Puzzles and hints can be insanely hard to figure out at times. Usually context is given and you can figure it out, but for things like why you should invest in the Church for no apparent reason or painting puzzles, it was really confusing and hard to know without a guide. Most of the time I didn't need a guide at all, but for those few specific times, it kills the enjoyment. I never use wikis or guides in games and I avoid them like the plague.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

Apart from the problems listed this game shines. Trust me, those problems go by the wayside once you're in the loop of exploring and connecting paths.

The artstyle is gorgeous, the world is dark and brutal, seriously, you brutally kill the enemies, OST is perfect as well, it fits the tone, going from calm, to unnerving to epic.

The gameplay is solid, specially the combat, its fair for the most part, you will struggle a lot at the start, but has you acquire more abilities and upgrades, you'll truly see the full potential of the combat system, your main method of dmg is your sword Mea Culpa, which you can upgrade and unlock several abilities for, like plunge or lunge attack or stronger combos, you also obtain Prayers which are essentially spells, and theres a lot of them that can be either offensive or defensive, fitting the situation. 

Bosses are well done and balanced, with some really creepy designs as well, they're challenging and you can use your many tools to approach each encounter.

The DLC bosses are far harder than the base ones, so anyone looking for a challenge has that to look for.

Speaking of, once you complete the game youre allowed into NG+, which increases the difficulty, you get to keep your abilities and items, but you lose all your HP and Fervor (magic) upgrades, as well as your healing Flasks, near the start of the run you can also choose a specific challenge, which changes how the run will play, such has halving your melee dmg but increasing your Fervor potential, making you a spellcaster essentially.

General difficulty of the game, not too challenging, its a lot easier than the similar game Hollow Knight, having played both i can say this for sure, buts its not easy by any means, this game will pull no punches for mistakes. 

One particular complain i have to mention is that i often ran into bugs that hindered my progress and forced me to reload the game, the most common one was related to an enemy that resembles a naked ghost woman with a rapier bugging out and becoming unkillable, and shes sometimes used in rooms where youre forced to kill all enemies, so you can guess what happens there. 

Also yeah, this game has quite a bit of nudity. 

Final thoughts, its an excellent game, you can see the devs put a lot of passion into it, specially with the world building which from my understanding was heavily inspired by religions from Spain, i think there was a guide on steam that went into detail in that regard.

The gameplay, the lore, the stylistic choices, the nuance and love put into this title... Near flawless, even when you are in the sections where the developers are clearly trying to induce rage. It's all worth it.


But just don't move your save file or anything or it will become corrupted. I was 99.5% done the entire game and I tried to get cheeky and put a 100% save file in so I could start the NG+ on that one instead of the one I was unable to get the 100% on (because I missed one single live event and an NPC died) and that was enough to corrupt my file and make it so NO FILE was readable in the game anymore.  I contacted The Game Kitchen/Team 17 and they really tried to help but to no avail.  Just play this and hope your save file does not get corrupted. 

And for The Miracle's sake; if you're going in blind like I did - just look up how to do Tirso's quest because you're going to be able to get 99.5% like me and want to rip your eyeballs out of their sockets when you can't get that last 5%.",1692059576,1692059576,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[i]Finding equal parts redemption and frustration in this pixelated purgatory[/i]

[b]Blasphemous[/b], developed by The Game Kitchen, offers players a visually striking and deeply atmospheric journey into a twisted world of religious fervour, grotesque monsters, and unforgiving challenges. While it excels in certain areas, it falters in others, resulting in an experience that is both captivating and equally frustrating.

[u][b]Visual Splendour[/b][/u]: [b]Blasphemous[/b] immediately captures players' attention with its hauntingly beautiful pixel art style. Every frame is meticulously crafted, portraying a macabre world that is equal parts unsettling and captivating. From the grotesque enemies to the intricate level designs, the game's visuals are undoubtedly its strongest asset, creating an immersive atmosphere that draws players into its dark narrative.

[u][b]Devout Combat[/b][/u]: The combat in [b]Blasphemous[/b] is a double-edged sword. On one hand, the game offers a diverse array of weapons and abilities that allow players to customise their approach to combat. The brutal and visceral animations make each encounter feel impactful. However, the combat can often feel clunky and imprecise, leading to frustrating deaths that feel more due to the game's mechanics rather than the player's skill. The difficulty curve can also be uneven, swinging from manageable to downright punishing in a matter of moments.

[u][b]Penitent Progression[/b][/u]: [b]Blasphemous[/b] introduces a unique progression system that ties into its grim narrative. Players accrue ""Mea Culpa"" points to unlock new abilities and improve stats, allowing for a sense of character growth. Exploration is rewarded with hidden secrets and challenging platforming sections that test players' dexterity and problem-solving skills. However, the lack of a clear map and navigation system can lead to confusion and endless backtracking, especially towards the end of the game where it's not clear where the player is supposed to go which really dampened my enthusiasm for it.

[u][b]Narrative Ambiguity[/b][/u]: While [b]Blasphemous[/b] boasts a captivating world and intriguing lore, the storytelling can be frustratingly opaque. Much of the narrative is left to interpretation, and important plot points are often obscured behind cryptic symbolism. While this approach can create an air of mystery, it can also leave players feeling disconnected from the overarching narrative, especially if they are seeking a more concrete understanding of the world they are navigating.

[u][b]Soundscapes of Suffering[/b][/u]: The audio design in [b]Blasphemous[/b] enhances the eerie atmosphere, with hauntingly beautiful music and eerie sound effects that contribute to the game's sense of foreboding. The sombre melodies and chilling ambient sounds combine to create an auditory experience that complements the game's visual aesthetics.

[u][b]Conclusion[/b][/u]:

[b]Blasphemous[/b] is an ambitious endeavour that brings players into a dark and twisted world brimming with religious iconography and brutal challenges. Its mesmerising visuals and unique progression system are definite highlights, but the occasionally clunky combat mechanics and narrative ambiguity hold it back from achieving true metroidvania greatness. If you can weather the storm of frustration, and trust me it gets incredibly frustrating towards the end of the game, and embrace the game's haunting atmosphere, [b]Blasphemous[/b] offers a rewarding experience that will stick with you long after the credits roll despite its many shortcomings.

[u][b]Pros[/b][/u]:

- Captivating pixel art visuals
- Unique progression system
- Atmospheric audio design

[u][b]Cons[/b][/u]:

- Clunky combat mechanics
- Narrative ambiguity
- Lack of clear navigation tools

Pros:

I love the art style. I did enjoy that it's a metroidvania game that is full of secrets and the voice acting was good. You're definitely getting your moneys worth.

Cons:

I didnt feel like the fun was there. I would defeat a boss and wouldn't get rewarded. The hitboxes also didn't make sense to me because my sword swing animations looked like they are hitting the enemy but wouldn't register as hits. I also think it that getting locked with the down button and not being able to jump was a terrible design mechanic.

I did like hollow knight but I didnt like momodora. (Fun fact, Momodora was the first PC game I ever played and finish.)",1691199923,1691629374,False,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

Blasphemous is a game that I was aware even before it came out, due to the marketing, and have been played the game almost since its release. It might not be the best metroidvania out there, but it's almost everything that I'm looking for in a game of the genre: a game that I can have fun playing and exploring fully without the need of becoming a pro at it.

The combat is engaging, although you only have one weapon, you can also parry (with a perfect parry option), dodge, and you also have a ranged attack and a special move, called Prayer, that you can choose from over 20, counting the ones that were added with the expansions. One of the biggest selling points when the game came out was the violence, which can be seen through the executions of the enemies, with almost everyone having their own animation.

The graphics are not gonna make your PC explode, but it's very well done, everything looks like a work of art, and I really felt that they were getting better with time, as the last expansion has some absolutely beautiful imagery. I didn't find the soundtracks as remarkable as the visuals, and never really felt the need to listen to it after the first time I beat the game (with the exception of the new stages and bosses that are fought in subsequent playthroughs). It's definitely good and matches the game perfectly, but experiencing it one time was enough for me.

The story is... certainly one of the parts of this game. It can be very confusing, trying to understand everything that is happening, as the information is presented very cryptically at first, at least Ionly felt like I really understood the story after playing the final expasion. But the gist of it is easy to get, just the details that take a little more time to wrap your head around. It's very much like dark souls in that aspect.

As for the difficulty, it was easy in the first playthrough, but hard after. So, here is how the game goes: you have that first time you play through it, then you can start a new game plus, in which you will have the content of both of the expansions available, as well as the option to impose certain 1 out of 3 restrictions on your character, that after being beaten, will grant you some equipment that'll give you positive effects, some really good, some kinda worthless. The first time is kinda ok, you might die, but it's hard to get stuck, as for the ng+ stuff, you might get hard stuck on some of it, but the method of hitting your head against the wall till you break it works every time.

After having beaten everything, with the exception of the boss rush mode, I can say that the game is one of the best and most accessible metroidvania out there, although the sudden increase in its price makes it hard to recommend buying it out of a sale.",1691602187,1691602187,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

updated review: I still believe the gameplay is janky, but I didn't realize I missed key npc's really early on and had a MUCH harder time than I would've otherwise. ended up fighting two of the much harder bosses in the game as my first bosses without any upgrades, which probably didn't help anything. 

but still, many attacks are poorly telegraphed, some attacks are only parryable when you are a certain distance away from bosses, they almost all deal *contact* damage which is a mechanic I despise, and there is seemingly no indication what can and cannot be dodged with iframes. An enemy later does a roll to reposition but it is also an attack, and unlike its original counterpart encountered very early in the game your only option is to jump it with no ingame language communicating this.

Finished the game and though it has a spike in quality near the end it plummets back down to hell with the ending and true ending.

Its hard to say how this game with pretty simple mechanics captivates you in such a religious way.. but it simply does! 
I have no positive feelings about religious themes when they are too serious, but this game and the setting and the perverse way it takes catholic religion and its old old icons, and makes it a really cool feel.
The bleak and depressing setting actually makes the game feel really bad, but the design and placement of everything works perfectly, and honestly i feel everytime i die, its my fault for not bringing my best to the game. 
I cant wait to see more titles like this in the future and thanks team 17 for making this amazing game.

I finally beat the last boss, after a gruesomely long time, but gosh, the release and proud feeling it got after clearing this game is just the best, i cant wait for part 2 and i hope everybody plays this first before going into 2, this is really a solid start of this franchise or series.",1573953431,1691018500,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The world and level design is superb, with huge enemy and bosses variety and tons of content and secret pathways, which usually contain meaningful upgrades and fantastic NPCs. This game does not waste your time in exploring aspect and makes it very enjoyable to go through the world of Custodia.

Combat feels fantastic. Plethora of moves, powerful chants that annihilate enemies and executions with very gory finishers that are never a bore to watch.

I cannot stress enough how good visuals of this game are. I think that The Game Kitchen is one of the (if not the best) Pixel-Art game developers who understand what makes pixel art games a joy to watch and play. Every level, enemy encountered even cinematics are a sight to behold. It's like Fromsoftware art design put through the pixel beam, it's just so good. 

The music score is great and memorable. Each song for different areas and boss encounters. Not only it elevates a fantastic game underneath it but also makes it an absolute spectacle to behold.

I've spent something around 40 hours  in the game as of making this review and I still have got so much to discover: new endings, questlines and bosses and game modes which are absolutely brutal but bring out a lot of fun. I just can't stress enough how good this game is and can't wait for the sequel.

First, the good. The art style is fairly standout, it's not something everyone will like, seeing guys junk, old bloody disfigured corpses, and everything in the older style that they use, but it's different from most games, and generally most will probably find it interesting.
The world is fairly big and the game decently long, there's some replay ability as well. It's not too short or anything.
Some interesting lore and story, not personally my cup of tea as much, but still present and for many it may be good.

Now the bad...
The bugs, first and foremost OH GOD THE BUGS! Dropping from a ledge or platforming, or jumping in a fight? Well I hope you don't mind losing controls on your character, getting stuck in mid air randomly unable to move, having all inputs locked, or countles other things. I've had these happen in boss battles, or while exploring over half a dozen times, some requiring game restarts and losing progress.
Never alt tab out during jumping, or elevators, or various other conditions, it wont end well, if it ever ends...
Or just the simple ones like not being able to press a button to respawn on the gamepad when you die, and needing to go tap it on the keyboard instead for some reason (when you were using gamepad to play, only ever was able to respawn with gamepad once my entire 30 hours so far).

Next, input queuing, and combat. It's bad. They only seem to really queue inputs on the sword. So slash, slash... you'll double slash. Slash, jump, slash... you'll just stand there double slashing, no slash then jumping to air slash. No slash then sprint to slash, only attacks queue so if you ever want to do anything other than stand still, learn to never spam the attack button. That said, it's outright bugged here in areas, multiple cases I've input other commands before, or done other things and it ignores them, seeming to prefer having my character stand still and just swing out of range of the enemy but readily dying. Overall this is my biggest complaint of the game, the controls are just insanely unreliable feeling for a game where you're trying to not take a single hit, or do perfect actions. I loved challenging myself in hollow knight, and even did some dumber challenge runs in dark souls or Sekiro, but no way I'm ever trying that in this game. 

The platforming, it's also kind of odd. Sometimes you'll walk near the edge of a ledge, but not fall good, you weren't over the edge yet), but walk back away from the edge and suddenly fall/slip down through the ground? Or the air jump via attacks thing, seems very inconsistent and unreliable, overall a number of problems here on the movement side, but not too bad since there's not much of real platforming challenges in this game that use these all, so constantly annoying, but not a game breaker.
That said, it adds to frusteration early on when falling in some places is instant death, and for a sometimes long run back.
Later on there's the bloodstained ritual of the night co lap and challenges... that's the real problem, that's where it hurts, and I just gave up on the last challenge because the movement/platforming was just not reliable/consistent. At least in Hollow Knights house of blades, I just failed a ton because I still sucked, eventually got gud... here... changing controllers or trying mouse and keyboard just in case my main one was failing... nope, it's just their input and control system having issues and bugs and stuff.

Bosses, some are good, overall mostly towards the easy side. Though also again with the bugs or oddities and lack of polish. One got stuck, another crashed the game, another got locked and I couldn't hurt him once, others just jump/get outside the visible screen and make it very hard to really deal with that when you can't see their tells or stuff, and then some attacks do seem rather... lacking for consistent ways to evade them, but honestly that might just be me not having found them yet, again, not like I was retrying these all 10 or 20 times to learn all their details, nor did I ever look online for guides, most I beat first time, others generally less than three tries until the final two of sorts, took a few more on them. At least on my first play through.

So overall... so many problems that keep it from really being one I can highly recommend, but the world and core stuff is there, so if you've dealt with the other main games and want a new decent metroidvania... it's still worth it to try at least I'd say. Despite it's issues better than some other ones, but again because of them still held back. Given how long it's been out, don't expect these issues to get bug fixed. Heck, they just released a new update today, and I immediately noticed it had broken some more things with it.

Blasphemous kept me engaged much longer than I expected. The gameplay is great with the right amount of challenge (for me) that really feels fulfilling when overcome. I played it on my Steam Deck, which is just perfect for metroidvanias like this, and it runs great! Encountered slight bugs here and there, but nothing major. I LOVE the art style, it has really good world-building that sucks you right in. I also really liked the music, but some areas did not have any which is a bit of a bummer.

---{ The Not So Good }---
I'm really not a fan of missable achievements and blasphemous has multiple of them that are also associated with story lines. It's really easy to miss these as the steps required are quite obscure and I have no idea how I should've known these without looking them up. I also missed a lot of main unlockables, [spoiler] called relics in this game [/spoiler], for the gated progression while finishing the story and gaining those can also be obscure, which I wasn't a fan of. After ending the story there was a lot of backtracking that I felt I wanted to ""finish off"" as the story had already ended. There are also different endings, but I've read that you would be able to get all endings in one run. If you want to get all achievements, be prepared to play the game 2.5 times WITH GUIDES. Finally I'm not a fan of how the pogo mechanic works in blasphemous.

First one, it has a lot of missables and requires a guide or constant googling to avoid ruining quest lines. Even the ""true"" ending is missable if things aren't done in certain order (at least what can be consider the true ending with what the trailer of blasphemous 2 showed).

Second reason, and maybe it won't happen to everyone, the bugs. I encountered many minor bugs during my playthrough, things like getting hit makes you go through thin walls in certain moments, phasing through platforms when landing near the edge (even when the animation indicated that I landed), or having weird interactions with ladders.

The best part is by far the visuals and theming. It is BEYOND phenomenal, especially from a small team. Combined with the stellar voice acting and immersive music, Cvstovia will stick with you long after you put the controller down.

Although the controls are tight, precise and fun to master, you will get tired eventually as there are only 1 or 2 ways you go about any situation, and there are many situations that will infuriate you (looking at you, Mourning and Havoc).

I can only recommend this game to people who are fans of Metroidvanias and/or souls-likes because while it's presentation is worth staying until the end for, the gameplay is a tall hurtle that won't work for everyone.",1689912861,1689912861,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

i've played through this game during its release, and while it was overall a good experience, back in launch it definitely felt like it needed some more baking. and that's what the devs did, they went silent for 9 months-ish before coming back with an overhaul the form of a free dlc, the stir of dawn. 

and my god, this update changed my initial 7/10 feeling to a solid 9/10. map clarity, rest point teleportation, absolutely LEGENDARY spanish dub, bonus bosses in ng+, penitences that changes your playstyle in ng+... and they could've just stopped there and it'd still be an amazing game, but no they went beyond. the true ending got me super hyped for the sequel and i can't wait to go back in and sin even harder.

[b][u]positives:[/u][/b]
+ gothic gruesome catholicism is lit
+ extremely high quality pixel art
+ OST with great boss music (also on spotify)
+ highly replayable with ng+ penitences, different prayer/rosary builds
+ bonus round: penitence of true guilt is the correct way to experience the game. no healing, one health bar and that's it, makes you really think of your approach to fights. shame that it's ng+ only
+ game length is just enough to where it doesn't feel like it's padding your game time
+ able to inherit relics that allows for some sequence skipping in ng+
+ spanish dub is god tier

[b][u]negatives:[/u][/b]
- backtracking can feel really awful early on until you invest 20k into unlocking rest point teleportation
- some prayers are simply better and stronger than the rest. debla of the light and tiento to your thorned hairs can breeze you through the game
- having to rediscover the map upon ng+, not a problem for me personally but might be for some
- collectible tracking is kinda awful unless you abuse map markers. i wish there's an easier way that isn't ""run through every possible spot to see if you've missed one""
- true ending has two(!) points of no return and if you miss it you have to go through a playthrough again
- when i tried the ""requiem aeternam"" achievement back in 2020 i needed to start a fresh playthrough, ng+ didn't count, found out the hard way, seems like they fixed it upon some googling, sadge

[b][u]tldr: [/u][/b]
to put it bluntly, the game isn't really doing anything 'new' or groundbreaking, but i ended up doing 6 playthroughs and getting all achievements, so i will go with ""yes it is pretty heckin' good"".

play this game if you liked metroidvanias that is challenging without being ridiculous, imo everything in this game is fair, most of my deaths were classic skill issue™. [b]verdict: 9/10[/b].",1689851859,1689852145,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Both the lore and gameplay try to hint at a level of depth that they lack. Many attacks give no indication that they hit through your parry or dodge, making these critical tools unreliable, and even simply evading attacks is inconsistent due to awful hitboxes. Additionally, enemies have colossal health pools, needlessly slowing down the simple movement from area to area. Furthermore, the game's fundamentals are lacking. Level design ranges from inoffensive to atrocious, and combat is much the same. Most secrets are either out in the open or behind an undisguised progression gate, or else behind the game's various breakable walls, many of which lack any sort of indication and are simply discovered by luck.

In conclusion, Blasphemous takes a lot from its inspirations, but fails in its own additions and furthermore fails to replicate their strengths.

My complaints are minor. Firstly, there are a handful of advanced movement mechanics that feel really finnicky to pull off. Normally, I would classify this as a skill issue, but the game doesn't tutorialize them very well, and doesn't give you anywhere to practice them. And when I'm inputting the proper combo for said techniques, and it only works *some* of the time, it's hard to feel like it's my fault when I die.

I bought this on sale in 2023 and it was phenomenal.

The game is like most metroidvania games. Sidescrolling fighting action and exploration. You return to areas after unlocking new abilities to visit previously inaccessible areas. 

The game has great replay value as it also has 3 different endings

And it has NG+ with three different penetances to choose from each time. 

This allows for at least six playthroughs if you would like to be thorough. 

The game features many unlockable skins and a mix of easy and difficult boss fights. 

The game also features a boss rush mode where you can fight through the bosses in an attempt to earn a fast completion time. 

The story is kind of reminiscent of dark souls in a way.

Overall I would highly recommend this game. If you enjoyed any of the Metroid or Castlevania games or hollow Knight you will love this game. 

Can't wait for the second one, which releases on August 23rd 2023

The cruel/horror aspects of European christianity is something that has appealed to me since i was a kid playing Diablo 1 and Hexen, which despite not having as obvious references as Blasphemous, still have churches filled with torment, and touch on aspects like penitence, sins and guilt to some extent.
Being that i am a fanatic of metroidvanias, that i adore soulslikes, and that some of the things i mainly seek when traveling are ancient churches/cathedrals and reliquaries...i cant even put into words how much this game's aesthetics appeal to me, and the symbology behind the lore is undescribable.
-----
Gameplay wise this game is super solid. Controls are smooth most of the time (tho there are some animation locks when in combat that can be quite unintuitive and annoying, like not being able to attack left and then right without first stopping to attack, redirect yourself, and then start attacking again)
The platform is very solid, tho in later parts it can be pretty frustrating, with enemy projectiles coming out of nowhere and knocking you off platforms (lookin at you Library of negated words....)
The highlight of the game are definitely the bosses. While none of them are incredibly challenging, they are very fun to learn and simply perfect aesthetically.

Thematic, visuals, sprite work, music, voice acting, and story all get a resounding 5/5. Genuinely some of the most interesting concepts I've seen in a video game and very well executed might I add. However all these factors simply cannot pull this game together for an enjoyable experience.

While the movement and platforming in this game feels pretty good for the most part, the combat is some of my least favorite I've experienced. For starters you are forced to stay still for string attacks while grounded, meaning that once you swing your sword if you're character is on the ground, you are forced to stay there until the attack or combo is over. This makes positioning against enemies absolutely atrocious, not to mention that your attacks will push some enemies backwards out of your attack radius so you can't even land a full damage combo on them. The spacing and positioning against a lot of enemies is horrible due to this so you're usually forced to use jump attacks or the high damage plunging attack. Another factor that greatly affects your boss fights is that your character and enemies all have a hitbox which means if you get too close to an enemy/boss you will take damage. This would almost be forgiveable if it didn't also stagger your character and completely interrupt your movement and attacks. Keep in mind that a lot of these bosses are either very large and take up a big portion of the screen or are constantly on top of your character attacking you so you're not only getting attacked but you're being staggered by their model's hitbox. The parry function works effectively on maybe 4 enemies in the whole game and is genuinely unintuitive to use if not entirely ineffective and a waste of a combat tool. After successfully parrying most attacks you're usually unable to attack in time afterwards our you're just sent backwards away from the enemy you parried. There is almost never a reward for a properly timed parry even though you're forced to use it in certain fights even when it's clearly disadvantageous. Your recovery time for a lot of attacks and or dodges is egregiously long and leaves you open far too often as well.
Straying away from combat a little bit I'll mention that some of the boss fights are just genuinely horrible. They do not strike any balance between difficult and just outright unfair. Half of the bosses are just out of reach and don't allow you to do any meaningful damage with a combo so you're instead getting one aerial attack in every minute or so. The bosses do not have very meaningful ""patterns"", where you do not feel like you're actively learning a better way to fight them. Instead you slowly realize that strategy is futile and you have to resort to getting single hits in when you can. I want to mention that the second to last boss was far more difficult (unintuitive) than the actual final boss, which granted isn't a cardinal sin in the gaming community but after spending upwards of 30 minutes on one boss only to have the final boss be over in 5 seems a bit ludicrous.
To sum up combat I would say that there is absolutely no flow to it and it feels clunky and unrewarding. Upgrading your combat skills really doesn't feel impactful except for when you first unlock them. Every upgrade after that seems trivial and doesn't impact gameplay whatsoever.
Onto the world/map layout I want to say that the first hour of the game can feel a bit frustrating to explore and understand but after clearing a few areas it all starts to connect really well. I think the teleporting function could've been introduced earlier or just in a better way as the backtracking can feel very exhausting. You should be able to teleport more directly to where you need to go but I'll be forgiving since at least there is a teleporting function at all. The map however is next to useless if you're looking for any specific thing. Sure it shows you the rooms and ways to get into them but none of the npc's that are crucial are actually marked with a name. They simply have a vague icon and do not give any context when you hover over them making it a bit of a guessing game the first time around.
Lastly I'd like to say that the upgrades to your characters stats (health, mana, etc.)  All seem pretty substantial. HOWEVER, there is almost no reason to upgrade your bile flask as it forces you into a certain play style. When upgrading your flask it will increase the amount of health replenished but in turn will reduce your amount of flasks with no option. This means that instead of healing when you can you have to heal when you're close to death. You don't get to pick and choose when you heal to avoid high damage attacks just to top your health off, you have to either waste half your flask topping off or wait until you're very low health. It's a blatantly horrible trade off with no advantage nor do they mention that upgrading your flask will permanently change it.
Overall I did not have a good time playing this game and would've sooner refunded it had I known how it would play out. I don't think the story and visuals made up for the experience at all and I ended up forcing myself to beat the game in the hopes that the final boss and ending would've been incredible and redeemed the whole game. They did not. 
Don't buy this game for a good time OR for a challenge as it does neither. Instead I would read up on the lore and such and check out the awesome artwork via pictures and videos instead of forcing yourself to play it.",1689199226,1689199226,False,8,0,0.522754967212677002,0,True,False,False

I've  found myself both annoyed by the repetitive strategies (approach, slash, retreat/parry, rinse and repeat every time you need to go somewhere) needed to defeat most enemies and underwhelmed by the tools the game put a my disposal. Unavoidable and space filling attacks don't make me feel tested, they make me feel cheated and lied to.  
After getting to the final boss and losing all my will to proceed, I can now complete the review.
Though the themes remain interesting, the game did not stimulate me enough to try and complete it fully. the feeling to increasing distrust and annoyance (especially the 3 part combo near the end) just made the whole experience feel undercooked and in need of more time to mature. Grandiose words and dialog, promise of great things to come and, in the end, great disappointment with some good-ish experiences in the middle.

Summary:
Things I enjoyed:

- the themes and their visual representations. Though they could use a bit more relation between visual and verbal references;

- about half the mechanics. The prayers and, especially, the relics, were very interesting, flavourful and I felt they were decently used in the exploration of the map (though the free falling veil could become more of a nuisance when trying to overcome an enemy that would propel me 2 floors down);

- the music. Apart form the track used in the Silent Path (it evoked too much the track used in the area Deepnest in ""Hollow Knight"".

Tings I was not so happy about:

- the slight hitches, such as: getting perma-stunned by an enemy, the way the platforms would at times not respond to the character being on top of them, especially when jumping onto them,;

- the way the different teleportation systems in the game felt disjointed and not complimentary;",1617587506,1689186625,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I was never really a big metroidvania guy. I haven't played one in a decade and a half. After giving this game a shot, I bought 7 more soulslike-metroidvania games. 

It's really fun. That being said, it's not Dark Souls. I would not go in with the expectation of building your own class or having weapon variety. I think of this game as more of a slight nod to the Souls series while doing its own thing with its own spin. It's only really comparable to Dark Souls in the vague sense that parry and dodge are core combat mechanics, has a fragmented story with lore in the item descriptions, no hand holding side quests, and rest spots. 

The gameplay is dodging and parrying in a 2D Metroidvania. Blasphemous has a nice twist on the Dark Souls 2 death mechanic. In DS2, when you died you lost bits of your max health bar until 50% max health. In Blasphemous, it's your skill bar/magic that will lose up to 50% depending on how many times you die. I say it's nice because losing your skill/magic bar is not even remotely detrimental like DS2 half health was.

Another twist Blasphemous does for the soulslike genre is instead of chasing after your souls when you die like in DS, you chase after bits of your skill/magic bar.

It’s time to brush up on your Latin, polish that statue of St. Bartholomew, and bust out the cat-o-nine-tails for some self-flagellation, Blasphemous is here to remind you of what Catholics have known for nearly 2,000 years: suffering is not only a part of life, it’s the entire point.

Developer The Game Kitchen teamed up with Team 17 to release what can only be described as a Medieval Catholicism-inspired metroidvania, and the themes, setting, and general atmosphere hit the nail on the cross…I mean head. Oozing with brutal, grotesque, and ultra-gory visuals and lore, Blasphemous is also a tight, fluid, side-scrolling ARPG that plays incredibly well. While mechanically the game doesn’t do much to break the mould, thematically it’s like nothing out there, and I am actually shocked that this type of setting has never really been fully explored in a video game before. Catholicism, especially in the Middle Ages, was, quite literally, all about guilt and suffering, and Blasphemous takes this theme and brilliantly merges it with a game formula that perfectly suits the idea: die in violent and vicious ways, get resurrected, and do it again.

Players take on the role of “The Penitent One”, allegedly the survivor of the “Silent Sorrow” wreaked by “The Miracle” who must collect (and suffer) through various humiliations and deaths in order to save the land. Similar to games like Dark Souls, the lore in Blasphemous is handed out in vague, obfuscating methods like item descriptions and cryptic conversations with NPCs. The Game Kitchen went all out with committing to the themes of the game, and if you didn’t spend your whole childhood going to church or Catholic school, you may need to brush up on your terminology and history. The dedication to this idea, from the writing and level design to the enemies, weapons, items, and menus, is staggering and I loved every second of it. Your abilities come from customizable a customizable rosary with slots that can be unlocked to fit rosary beads that grant bonuses like extra health, stronger attacks, better dodging etc. and all come with thematically appropriate lore and reasoning. Collectibles come in the form of relics, AKA bits and pieces of the bodies of Saints that have been martyred in various savage and sadistic ways—another point for historical accuracy—and your “magic” spells/abilities are found in various prayers that can also be equipped. You can even essentially buy indulgences to remove the levels of “guilt” that are obtained during each death that lower your health and fervour (power meter for prayers). I can’t gush enough about how each and every gameplay mechanic is built to fit with the themes and setting of the game. Sure, the mechanics are similar to other titles, but the manner in which they’re implemented and the style choices make Blasphemous a truly unique creature.

As far as gameplay goes, it’s a 2D side-scrolling action platformer with non-linear levels full of branching paths and secrets. You’ll spend ages exploring the levels, especially once you begin to unlock new traversal abilities that allow you to backtrack and access areas previously locked or inaccessible. Combat focuses mainly on Mea Culpa, the giant thorny sword wielded by our hero, which has its own tree of upgrades and unlocks with more complex and powerful movesets. Combat itself is both challenging and satisfying, with a solid sense of progression and visceral impacts and executions. Did I mention how gory this game is? Right from the get-go in the tutorial when the Penitent one fills up his conical helmet with blood from a vanquished foe and slaps it onto his head, you know this game is going to be brutally violent and messy. Players can jump, dodge, and parry enemy attacks, and the slow-drip stream of upgrades and gradually increasing difficulty keeps things interesting but never overwhelming or stagnant. From low-level goons to boss fights, you’ll be using every tool at your disposal to hack and slash your way to the end of the game.

Now while the level layouts are excellent, and combat feels great, what truly makes Blasphemous stand out from the crowd is, again, the focus on (or inspiration from) Medieval Catholicism. Enemy design is top notch, including self-flagellating monks that heal by whipping themselves, women chained to angelic statues that are used to smack the player, floating bishops in gaudy golden chairs that stab downwards, and so much more. Suffering, guilt, and blood coat the game from top to bottom, and almost every major character in the game has been through some form of mental and physical torment that then becomes the stylistic choice for their movesets and attacks. One of the characters is notorious for being so beautiful she melted her own face off with hot oil because people were paying too much attention to her and not enough to worshipping The Miracle. The level design also mirrors this, ranging from standard snow mountains and dungeons to gothic churches and sewers rife with floating miasma. This game also has my favourite achievement ever in a game, awarded after killing 666 enemies—how perfect.
 
I enjoy studying history and theology, and I went to Catholic school for most of my life. I also love metal and gory horror flicks, and this combination of bias led to me appreciate Blasphemous on multiple levels while also being consistently impressed with the amount of research that went into the game. I am in love with the aesthetic of this game, and it’s honestly a bonus that it plays as well it does. The level design, the various little details squeezed into each enemy and character, the visuals, the music, the lore…it all adds up to being a game that will be fun for any fan of the genre, but even better for players who are familiar with the history and iconography of the Catholic church. This game wasn’t on my radar until my Editor send the code my way because he thought I’d like it (and I did), but I am super grateful it found its way into my living room. Blasphemous is an excellent metroidvania with a fantastically realized setting and gorgeous, albeit barbaric, aesthetic.

Everything good about the game is 11/10 for me. But since Steam only lets you rate games one way or the other and not in a more forgiving way I'd have to put it to ""not recommend"" unfortunately.
 
My gripes with this game, it has a very good base going on and executes what it sets out to do, but only on a simple basic when it comes to using the things you are given in a regular playthrough.

First time playing this, with no context what I'm necessarily getting into made the game very fun for a while, until it felt like my progress with the stuff I got; key items, abilities, mainly. Making my playthrough more confusing with what to do with all these items I have, at one point felt pointless to venture out for stuff nearing the end of the game.

- Key items, felt like a unnecessary maze trying to figure out what some of them are used for. Ended up finishing the game not knowing what 15 something key items in my inventory was for, felt like my efforts were for nothing since I had to guess almost everything. That and the fact that you're going to have to memorize where everything is on this gigantic map with annoying backtracking parts just to interact with something for 2 seconds. Even with fast travel points it still felt like a hike everytime I wanted to try to find what my key items were supposed to be used for.

- Abilities, felt impossible to apply in my gameplay except for one or two, (I only managed to find ~7 in my playthrough) that themselves some very niche uses.

Another thing that bothered me a bit is that there were a lot of parts of the game that were locked out because you'd have to find a few abilities that grants you access to these areas, I thought it would be something I'd find eventually by completing certain bosses in the game, but it is completely optional. Not sure if that is a metroidvania thing but I'm more used to you unlocking stuff like that through a regular playthrough progression.

There are a few amounts of QOL things that could be improved but feel like I was able to go through the game fine enough where it didn't bother me too much.

Amazing game, great visuals, and overall a great experience but with a few things that made my experience hampered.

Guilt fragments are also annoying, but not as much as I thought they would be like in the Souls games. I don't know why they need to put those things in the game other than to try and kill you, which i guess kind of fits the theme of the game.

At first I was introduced to this game through the music which had popped up in my playlist. For the summer sale the price of $25 down to $6.24, it seemed like a great deal. I had played Hollow Knight, all the big From Soft games, so I was looking for something challenging and I had heard good things about this so I figured why not. I blew through a lot of the game, and have like 45% completion after 6.6 hours. It was going good until it became abhorrent shit. I reached the Archcathedral Rooftops and found the worst shit I had ever seen in any game. Enemies that blocked my attacks while standing in idle. Becoming a penitent plinko as I would just get chained by attacks, all from one enemy who is just a reskin of Esdras.

Now, I would be willing to go explore more in case I was missing something, but moving around is so god awful, I would be able to make better progress walking around outside in real life. The lack of mobility is one of the worse parts about this game. The fastest way to move is spam the dodge, which I'm pretty sure doesn't even give immunity since of all the times I've used it I've found 0 immunity. This would be fine if I had some other form of movement, but nope, just a left, right, and jump. Anything like a constant sprint or just faster movement would make me want to backtrack and find new things, but one running pace through an entire area is my definition of tedious for the sake of being tedious.

Now I don't completely hate everything. The music, story, setting, artstyle, all masterpieces. The only catch is since everything is pixelated, telegraphs become so hard to read, you can't tell if you need to parry or dodge before your ass is already blasted in. An hour of my playtime is easily attributed to the hammer wielding fucks in the rooftops just spamming shit so I can't do anything.

I know my opinion will mean nothing given the very positive reputation this game has, I'm hoping to have new people who want to play this before the sequel comes out see what this game truly is. If you were wanting a fun, challenging game that puts a neat twist on the genre of 2D platformers, just play Hollow Knight. If you already have played Hollow Knight, play it again. I got this for 75% off and still feel ripped off. 

Also, why does it say ""skilled hack'n slash""? Hack and slash is the worst strategy to have since enemies can just ping pong you to death, so you can't just go in and fight. Your best bet is turning to God and praying that you don't have a reskined enemy chain attack you until you die.

Edit: Well, 14 hours and 19 minutes, 81.5% completion later and I finished the game. Now I am legally able to criticize all I want. The major issues I had still remain, spammy enemies just kind of thrown together at times to make up for the lack of difficulty were very much present in the archcathedral rooftops, but I didn't know that was almost the end so it could have been worse. Still lazy design. I did more side stuff which made my main issue very clear, that being one dimensional combat. The lack of effective vertical attacks makes it so your best bet is parry and dodge and swing. Granted this comes at the cost of when the game lets you do it. I experienced several times my attacks would just not hit, most often on the Esdras ripoffs in rooftops just walking past my prayer spells attacks. This brings me to my next major issue, the lack of telegraphs. This mainly applies to Esdras and Crisanta who I found to be really hard to tell what attack they were doing, so I would just either parry or dodge and hope something good happens. Speaking of combat, hope you don't have anything like ladders or climbable walls near you, or you'll grab them involuntary and be open to get knocked off. Again, very present in archcathedral rooftops.

Again, I want to say I don't hate everything. They did good since the final boss was probably my favorite. Despite taking only 3 tries, it had neat pacing, cool visuals, and a puzzle aspect that didn't feel overused. It's a shame the rest of the game couldn't be like that. If you have never played any games like this, it may be worth your time. But if you've played Hollow Knight or similar games, maybe pass since there is a larger reliance on artificial difficulty.",1688414733,1688868579,False,0,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False

This game is pretty incredible. The pixel art is a mix of the best from squaresoft and metal slug, with a more mature theme. It kind of ruins other pixel art games, no other game comes close. The gameplay mechanics are great, and there's a lot of content to be consumed and discovered in the form of items, areas, secret passages, etc.

An absolute must play for anyone who grew up playing platforms in the 80s and 90s.

How lucky of me for having found this game recently (and playing it a ton on the Deck), because now that I finished it, it is close to the release of Blasphemous II.

The enemies in this game for the most part are annoying over quality or engaging. 90% of the monsters in the game are put in places that more of like make them environmental hazards than anything which is super annoying. The DREAD BACK TRACKING IS INSANE IN THIS GAME. PERIOD. While I don't find this in games normally, the annoyance of backtracking rears its head so much due to the enemies being awful quality. Now I may have been overpowered but most bosses I basically felt like I tanked with healing over actually caring for their attacks. The Boss are the highlight of the game but during my play through there was a huge lull where there were none until I fought many of them back to back after of course backtracking. Now I went in blind but 90% of the time I had no idea where to go but the fact that places are kept away from the player with little or no explanation via items and relics is extremely annoying. The fact that a ton of the game is gated by a key you can just pass up if you don't have the money and forget about is mind boggling. Another extremely annoying feature I hate in all metros that have it, insta kill spikes and collision damage. Hollow knight is the best metro in the world and guess what.. no insta kills. Wanna know why? Insta kill hazards and the most annoying time wasting things i despise in all games. I have no idea why games include ""spike insta kills"" like who even likes these? I have never had someone die to spikes full hp with full health pot or fall of a cliff and be like "" yup I'd prefer to die than just tp back 5 seconds before missing a quarter to half my hp for the whoopsie daisy i just did."" Now let's talk collision damage. This game shouldn't have it at all. While this would make the game far easier as I swear most of the damage I take is collision and not actually getting hit, it's just super annoying to have an enemies knock you back with their attack and sit on you with collision damage. It also makes small area fights feel the worse. 

All in all I'm very mixed on the game but I'm sticking with a 5/10 with a negative. The game's annoying game play qualities and backtracking with little automated map marker make this game really rough to play blind and actually finish.",1688608846,1688608846,False,8,0,0.532907187938690186,0,True,False,False

The relics are you Metroidvania upgrades but much lamer they are really only used as a lock and key more then anything else for those who don't know a ''lock and key'' is when in game design you lock a item, weapon anything behind a item you need like needing a grappling hook in a Zelda game but those items should be MORE then just a key they should spice up the game in super Metroid the bomb is for breaking walls, attacking and scaling tall ledges. It is MORE then: you can't break this wall come back later. What does blasphemous have make platforms appear in set locations, you can make a climbable vine and move normally in swamps. for those relics they have NO other purpose and i think if they did they could have made the platforming much better. the platforming isn't bad per Se but the game does try to make up for it by making a gimmick for each area but i just wonder how much better it could all be if the relics were interesting and unique. also for anyone worried the game isn't too difficult (i beat most bosses 5 tries of less). moving on the games story is very cryptic and vague. too much so for me. I just couldn't understand it mainly though for the writing being kinda pretentious. about what though? I don't know. also i hate the hidden walls that's just lousy game design. like a important NPC. though surprisingly I found almost every bone and cherub except one which impressed me that i won't harp on. speaking of harps I just ADORE the music in the game the composer did a excellent job and encapsulating the vibe and atmosphere of the game. some minor nitpicks left: why can you only have 3 relics at a time it is stupid, some of the puzzles suck like have these items then use the attack the deals damage to you to open the door( the hint for those was that there is a small bit of blood on the floor which is easily overlooked), in the ice area the when the wind blows it can be hard to tell which direction, the  wall climbing is very finicky, the quests are almost impossible to know what to do ( like one of the endings you need to find a hidden wall luckily i found it).Overall though i did like the game but it does have some archaic elements but it still a fun game to play (probably not a good idea to 100 percent it I imagine). my final verdict is a 8.3/10.

Blasphemous seems to take a much more open approach to it's world map than other games in the genre gating off not progression but mostly [i]optional[/i] content and items. So with the tools you start with you can go where you want when you want to. Another thing I really appreciated was the placement of some of the more important powerups, with the item to make a level less of an obstacle usually found within the area itself instead of halfway across the giganto-maze-world! The areas standout from eachother and if you're a fan of the Souls game, grimdark, or Spanish Catholicism aesthetics you're gonna love this pixel art.

Only real negatives that stood out to me was teleporters for faster world travel seem few and far between, maybe a couple more sprinkled in would have made long treks back to levels less of a slog(although even then there's usually some side content or secrets you'll inevitably find along the way). Another thing I didn't like was how the free update content was added to the original game's map. This might be a niche problem since players who played day one wouldn't have experienced this, but the worst time I had with the game was entering the post-launch content area unbeknownst and getting my shit kicked in by a boss that was clearly meant for players more late game. In a game where you can tackle the available bosses in any order and still do decent damage to them regardless of where you are in the game this boss felt like a brick wall the game had promised never to construct. Another thing that came up a bit too often were odd bugs usually caused by colliding with an enemy while doing another action. I had bugs as annoying as not being able to jump, zooming down ladders 4x faster than possible, and even one where all of the breakable items on the levels turned invisible! Even with these complaints they were minor moments for me and only slightly fudged up my time with an otherwise fantastic game!",1688267642,1688267808,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

To be honest the religous themes in blasphemous really captivated me 
the combat is really fluid and I didn't really like it at first glance cuz of the  contact damage but 
got my way arround it and eventually learn to approach it diffrently than other soulslike/metroïdvania.
The story and lore is really great if you pay attention to item description and npc dialogue. The level design is pretty good but found it really punising at the start of the game when you don't have alot of bile flask prayers unlocked and upgrades but if you explore the nook and cranny in the levels you can find at least one upgrade for your health and flask  in every level.  The pixel artstyle for the background ,enemies and bosses is really good and I liked it. The bosses have one of the most cool looking desing and attacks that Ive seen in a game and their apperance really tells their story witout having to dug deep into item description same with the enviromental storytelling that I really enjoyed. I really reommend this game to anybody that is remoutely into soulslike/metroidvania genre or are into religion as a subject and their symbolism ,meaning and mythos  behind it.

And with the announcement of Blasphemous 2, it was a sign that it was finally time to take the plunge into the world of Blasphemous. 

I can say for sure that the presentation was easily the strongest part of Blasphemous. The visuals, the music, the symbolism, the lore, everything is absolutely flawless. The environments and characters are all beautiful with gothic, religious themes, and despite a somewhat dreary and de-saturated color palette, it makes everything in the game look hauntingly beautiful... and also really bizarre at times, but in a good way. The music perfectly fits every moment, from the ominous treks through the levels to the clashes with the game's bosses. Every visual, every theme, it all is crafted beautifully to create a very unique feeling that few games could hope to replicate. 

In standard Metroidvania fare, the game has deep lore that really isn't spelled out for you, but if you're willing to do a deep dive you can definitely get lost in the expansive lore. Perhaps what most intrigues me is the fact that everything in the game feels very deliberate. Every name, every image, every symbol, all of it was designed with purpose. If something seems like a coincidence in the game... it definitely isn't. 

However, somewhat ironically... I actually found the gameplay to be the weakest part of Blasphemous. Now, don't mistake my words; Blasphemous's gameplay is by no means bad. It's just that the gameplay is fairly standard compared to the excellent aesthetics. Combat has a somewhat ""heavy"" feel to it, being a bit slow but methodical with standard attack, jump, parry, and dodge mechanics. While I appreciate that it's a slower speed by design, i will say that it sometimes made the combat not flow as well as it could have, as it can be very stop-and-go at times and lacks a bit of oomph. The one thing that I do think is a little BS though is that knockbacks and knockdowns are a major issue in this game, as lack of recovery iframes and a very slow getting up animation can result in stunlocks from certain groups of enemies and even certain bosses. This wasn't game-breaking, but it was a frequent annoyance. 

Level design is excellent, as you'd expect in a Metroidvania, with plenty of inter-connected areas and secrets to discover, and your character progression is rewarded by exploration. That said, it does feel like environmental hazards are more of an issue than the enemies, as by far the most damage I took while discovering came from environment rather than combat. This isn't necessarily a bad thing as it does create tension, but I'd be lying if I said certain areas weren't a slog to go through at times due to the game's slower pace causing platforming to be a little clumsy at times, especially since climbing up ledges takes a bit longer than I'd like. And yes, I have to mention; insta-death spike pits are a pain, but not an insurmountable one. 

Most of the bosses in the game were... fairly average, honestly. I found the bosses more memorable for their bizarre designs than for their mechanical value. Out of the 10 bosses I fought, only about 2 of them were ones I'd say I thoroughly enjoyed for their mechanics. A lot of the bosses felt very RNG-dependent, or too basic from having very repetitive AI. And without spoiling too much... I can definitely say the final boss was the one I enjoyed the least. I'm all for a fair challenge, but sometimes the bosses either felt too simple or felt difficult for the wrong reasons, and there weren't many bosses who reached that desired middle ground. That said, I didn't outright hate any boss (except the final one), but they just felt like a somewhat flat note at times. 

However, despite the criticisms I found myself excited for Blasphemous 2 after playing this game. The mechanics of this game are solid, and with a bit of fine tuning they could reach even greater heights. The presentation of the game was already top notch, so I'm immensely curious to see how the devs can improve the sequel to follow up on this game. Blasphemous definitely feels like a work of art, and while some mechanics could use some refining, it's still a fun game throughout.",1687450144,1687450710,True,5,0,0.583420038223266602,0,True,False,False

The controls feel sluggish and unresponsive. You can get animation locked, and the game does not allow overrides or cancels to change them. You can get used to it, but it needed more polish.
The bosses are sadly the WORST part of this game. While they look great, the fights often feel a lot more luck than skill based, with a number being truly rage inducing, made more so by the obvious potential this game fails to grasp.
The menu is absolute dogwater. It feels like this was a game made for consoles that was poorly ported to PC.  To this day, I find it easier to just alt f4 than navigate the menu to quit.

The ugly-
The game has REEEEEAALLY bad coding for handling multiple monitors or handling focus. If you have more than one, prepare to constantly click outside of the game. Apparently fucking around with UAC might fix it, but so far no dice.",1687366576,1687366576,False,0,1,0.437956184148788452,0,True,False,False

Unfortunately I've been asking myself at literally every point in the game ""why would they make this the way it is?!?!?!"". I think the platforming in the game has some really cool ideas! But it's hindered by the fact that it feels HORRIBLE. There have been so many times in the game where I die because my guy just doesn't want to grab onto a ladder, and several times where I need to redo a platforming section just because he didn't want to grab a ledge. 

This is also just a personal thing but I HATE the idea of taking damage when laying a finger on the boss, it makes me have to worry about touching them instead of playing the game and doing damage and y'know, PLAYING THE GAME. And the boss philosophy is really bad.

Rant over, I'll probably change this to a thumbs up later but rn there's a lot of dumb design choices that make the game feel """"Hard"""".

EDIT:
Nope, can't do it. I really wanna love it but nope. The game is only held up in high regard because of its story, art-style, and music. Everything else however is (imo) not worth it. 

The platforming feels horrible, I always had a death grip on my controller and the game would read my inputs 50% of the time. The ledge grabbing is also bad, after almost 30 hours of play I still don't know how you preforming on purpose. It just kinda does its own thing.
And the air attack, or whatever it's called, it sucks. A LOT of my deaths in the platforming for this game is because it just doesn't let me air jump.

Combat is eh, I liked the Prayers and how many uses the had in exploration, The dodging mechanic felt bad however and looking back on it... A lot of the bosses in the game would still hit you ever if you dodge perfectly. Worst of all you can be stun-locked by bosses, and mannnnnnnnnnnnnn, the feeling of rage I got when I was one bar away from winning, only to receive a 7 hit combo from a boss, and btw the bosses do a lot of damage to you, you'll die within at least 5-7 hits. and this was max hp with every defense-up buds In the game.

One criticism though, I disliked how during certain parts of the game you could get locked out of % that you needed in order to get a complete 150% save file. For example for Gemino's quest you might miss 100% map completion if you don't do it in the correct order. Also if you go for ending C first and get the fourth wound from Crisanta you can no longer get ending A, and ending A contributes towards completion % while ending C and B do not. Luckily you do not need a 150% save file to get all the achievements on steam.

To summarize, the game itself is a masterpiece however getting a full 150% save file is an awful experience and not doable unless following a guide. (to avoid soft-locks essentially)",1679780985,1687071468,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Every other aspect of the game is tormented by its miserable control and unpolished mechanics, the game is trying to mimic Souls games no doubt, but the 2D nature of the game limited its combat system's complexity, so the developer turned to add in mindless platform jumps and quirky gameplay mechanics in the hopes to drag out the play-through. The storytelling aspect of the game fell off in the second half as well. those big words they threw around sometime even add to the frustration build up from the gameplay. 

I wanted to love this game, and in some aspect I do, the game even shine at times, but those unpolished gameplay pushed me away from giving this game a positive review,

After 3.2 hours of trying to enjoy the game, 95% of my deaths are to platforming puzzles rather than enemies.

I bought it simply out of curiosity and I have never been happier with a decision. The art is beautiful, the story is amazing, and the combat, to me, is awesome and rewarding to learn. The game is hard, yes, but what better way to make you invest time and really sink in to this masterpiece. I have seen a lot of reviews talking about the hitboxes and bugs but I personally never had any negative experiences with hitboxes, nor did I experience any bugs at all. Some may find the hitboxes clunky but I feel it adds to the arcade feel of the game if you know what I mean. I do not want to sound like I'm praising this game while it has no flaws because that is just not true. 

Pros:
- visuals
- controls
- boss fights
- skill tree
- items that improve powers and skill (again showing that playing the game makes you more powerful
- fun and atmospheric platforming
- hidden quests
- get better as you progress (meaning health and overall skill)
- lots of content and paths after beating the game the first time
- amazing voice acting
- fun puzzles and parkour
- fun collectibles
- multiple + secret endings

Cons:
- poor map makes it kind of hard to know where you are in the first playthrough
- some mechanics can go unexplained which requires some tinkering on your end
- (some may consider difficulty a con) but it really gets easier as you play
- lack of any new weapons throughout the game
- while enemies differentiate per area they stay in the exact same spot

Off the top of my head, those are the main cons that I feel should be addressed, however, I MUST EMPHASIZE that this game is amazing and you should really give it a shot if you are curious just like I was. The game is very addictive and you will definitely be surprised by how deep the game actually is with its themes and takes on religion and identity. Do not worry about any offense given toward certain races, genders, or religions. This has nothing to do with that.

But the combat breaks it in half. This ship sunk so hard. In 3 hours I experienced what is probably only an iota of the buggy, terribly developed hit boxes, AoE, dodging, and general wonkyness of the attacks and movement. Great art, terrible game. And to quote another steam user: ""If you want to create a difficult and unforgiving platformer you need to provide the player with pixel perfect movement.""

Getting hit off a platform into instant death spikes so I could walk across the map (yet again) because the AoE of the enemy extends behind it by half a foot is not fun. I can stare at the back of an enemy's head from a foot away and I'll still get hit by it. The lack of any sensible control mapout at the start of the game also SUCKS. Like I didn't know I needed to check the tutorial thing in game startup, because I assumed it'd be annoying and constant.

Movement in general feels awful. The game must be based in Canada because the character is practically swimming in syrup with every action. Jumping, dodging, swinging, finishing, magic is all SO SLOW and you get hit constantly when you try to do magic and just stand there for 5 seconds getting wailed on. I fought two bosses with magic and it just... sucked. Why even include magic if it's just a gateway to getting half my health taken off by the 6 dudes you've pitted on me. Unlocking downward attacks was like a big eureka moment because I thought they'd be useful. No. Every enemy simply dodges your strike or isn't even hit despite being RIGHT UNDER IT. Don't give an attack a buttass massive animation and windup if it has an AoE smaller than the Player Character himself.

Most enemies can simply be staggered and the ones that can't are ""easy"" to dodge. Supposedly. They, like mentioned above, just hit you with their massive AoE that is arbitrarily placed a foot behind their backs when their attack faces the other direction. There's variety, but only just. Most every enemy is one of four things: big, charges or swings slowly; shield, has a shield; range, moves around a ton and throws crap; flying, flies... that's it.

But later on the difficulty will become manageable once you upgraded a lot of things, especially if you get a certain upgrade that heals you when ever you kill an enemy.
Managing health and not getting hit is the hardest thing in this game, your healing is very limited an to refill them you need to reach some altars which also acts as a checkpoint and re-spawn point. Accessing said altar will also re-spawn enemies though.

I really wanted to like this game but the gameplay is just so awful.  Don't get me wrong, the art and aesthetic is incredible, which is why its so upsetting that it's wasted on a game that plays like this.  

The main gameplay is combat and platforming.

Platforming:
The platforming is boring and unoriginal, its been done so many times before and most of the time, much better.  The movement is stiff and joyless, it feels like someone just tried to program the most generic basic jump, dodge, and walk physics possible.  
Obviously a game like Celeste has masterpiece platforming so I don't expect it to be on that level.  But even a game like Hollow Knight which focuses more on combat and exploration has way better platforming than this game.  That being said, Hollow Knight's platforming is still great, but not only is Blasphemous's platforming not great, it isn't even mediocre.  Hell, most flash games I've played have better platforming than this.

Combat:
The hitboxes make no sense and your dodge is janky and inconsistent.  You can't move while attacking unless you're in air, so you're either going to be jumping around swinging over your opponent's head or stuck on the ground locking into an attack animation.  Your parry is generic and lame, just hit the parry button a second before getting hit and you do a block and counter attack animation.  This part is definitely a nitpick but even the parry and counter attack animation feels like it takes too long to finish, made me want to avoid even parry because of how tedious it felt.  That wouldn't be that bad except for the fact that everything else feels slow in this game too, the attack, the dodge, casting a spell, healing, your walk and jump speed.  Having slower paced combat can be fine if done well, for example maybe if you compensate for the lack of speed with more complexity in the combat system.  But the combat is very surface level and plain, there's very little you can do to get better, so from the start you've pretty much ""mastered"" it since you can't get much better at such a shallow system.  And as I mentioned a ton of hitboxes make no sense, one enemy drags a bell behind them and swings it at you.  If you dodge behind them when they swing, then they just immediately go back to dragging the bell behind them.  And since you're also behind them, you get hit by the bell, even though it's not an attack.  It's the enemy going back to a neutral position from an attack.   Also even after the attack, when the bell sits on the ground, if you touch it youre taking full damage.  Thats only one example of course but that rough, unpolished, feel fills the entire game.  So all the difficulty is super artificial and due to simple jank, inconvenience, and tedium. 

Misc:
Other than that, the game is missing a ton of basic quality of life settings.  You can't customize much, like the controls and unless you're on controller, you're going to struggle to even read the description of items.  You also can't access settings while in game.

Overall just a very disappointing game.  Sucks to see so much amazing art wasted on such a dumpsterfire of a game",1686625862,1686628481,False,1,1,0.419962316751480103,0,True,False,False

This game quickly went from being something i was having a hard time getting into to one of my favorite games of all time, and i haven't even finished it yet. I was initially intrigued by the art style and pixel art, and the fact that its a 'vania with souls-like death mechanics, but then became so immersed in the world and characters and my curiosity in the lore has since not been quenched. Not only is it an impressive and challenging game but it is built around a setting that is equal parts haunting and beautiful.

The platforming controls well, combat is tight. New enemies constantly make you rethink your approach and suggest you use different skills.

Level design is smart and creative, puzzles are difficult enough to feel challenging but never impossible.

The Metroid/Vania influence is apparent, yet it is obvious this game was made in admiration of those games and never feels like it ripped them off. That being said your Super Metroid play experience will transfer practically 1:1.

The setting of Blasphemous is where the Dark Souls influence takes shape. The world has been plagued by something referred to as the miracle, tearing society apart and some people believe it to be an act of God. The main character is known as the Penitent One, meaning if you die in-game you break your state of penitence and are therefore guilty. The more you die the more guilt you accumulate (which reduces your mana bar) until you can find a means to cleanse it. 

I think what really blows my mind about this game is how the developers worked the themes and symbolism of religion into the mechanics and overall game-play of the project, really solidifying the art direction into its core. Rosary beads and relics function as perks and abilities and every item you collect has its own page where you read about its lore, leading you to piece together the story as you collect. Collectibles never feel tacked on or felt like an after thought, and you will always be rewarded for putting in the work to find them.

The feeling i get when i play this game is the same one i got when i first played Metroid as a kid and really cant get enough of it.

But why? Well, almost every aspect of the game is at least at S tier for me, and I'm not an avid metroidvania fan. 3-4 hours flew by easily when I sat down to play with this gem.

The strongest aspect of the game for me are the visual design and athmosphere. The pixel art is very well done by any standards. The game itself is heavily rooted in chatolicism and it doesn't even try to hide it, which really appeals for me. In my opinion, the creators managed well to carve their on niche/place among soulslike games and 2d sidescrollers/metroidvanias.

The enemy design and the design of the bosses are sublime aswell. The combat doesn't revolutionize anything, but with the variety of the enemies it manages to stay somewhat interesting until the end of the game. Finishing the main campaign withouth touching any of the DLC bosses and finishing only 1 of Miriam's challenges took me a little bit more than 14 hours.

I tried to string the story together by watching some youtube videos, after watching them, i can state that the story is superb aswell.

Also I really like how the managed the 'estus system' and its upgrades in this game.

What I kinda' didn't like was the ""Son of the Miracle"" bossfight, it was gimmicky.

Encountering a new enemy can be frustrating at first, but it makes it more rewarding when you learn to handle them easily later on.

I could count the flaws in this game on one hand. One enemy is tedious, an early boss is unusually difficult, and getting any ending besides the bad one requires looking up a guide online. 

The game provides a fair challenge, and dying feels like I made a mistake instead of the game being unfair (usually, anyway). Most of the difficult parts feel possible and dying is just part of learning how to get by (except that part with all of the broken ships, that part just sucked. But it isn't needed for the good ending, only the cannon ending).

The game starts with a cutscene where Mr. Blasphemer says to himself ""Just another bad day to be blasphemous..."" before killing a fairly large man.

He then goes out of his way to enter a town, pet a dog and explores an area with poison and all that. He encounters many ""bosses"" on his journey to the store which he may or may not find at the end. 

Mr. Blasphemer's signature catchphrases consist of but aren't limited to:
""Eek! Blasphemy time!""
""That's a big head, but mine is pointy!""
""My name is Mr. Blasphemer, and you will taste the wrath of my blasphemous blade!""

The gameplay (combat and platforming) is very punishing, but rewards patience, perseverance and (some) creativity. It does a good job of making it clear that your failure is your fault (although sometimes it will feel like a boss' attack pattern is bullshit, but that's few and far between, IMO). Exploration in this game is very rewarding, as is proper for a metroidvania. Progression also feels great because you get stronger and enemies that you've had more trouble dealing with in the past become much easier eventually.

As an aside, if you are a fan of Shin Megami Tensei games, then the narrative in this game is probably a good fit for you. It's not the same, but its a good flavor. Blasphemous is like Catholicism fan fiction taken up to 11.

One tip:
* If you find yourself having difficulty with a boss, try to spend some time looking for more things that will make you stronger. There are items that [spoiler]will give you resistances to certain types damage[/spoiler].
* [spoiler]Aim for the true ending. It's much more challenging, but sticking with it is going to be worth your while![/spoiler]",1685949782,1685950523,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Excellent setting and art. Quite a sight to behold.

Cons:
- Sub-par gameplay. Character is so slow it feels like it is moving through mud. Thought I was missing the 'run' button. Pick ups and items are seldom explained, and even some gameplay mechanics have been confused in general.
- Poor enemy variety and placement. Each enemy is very simple and telegraphs clearly. The game likes to throw dozens of them at you at once which is more inconvenient than anything, and doesn't feel like it rewards skill. This quickly grows very boring.
- Piss-poor story and lore. Font is borderline unreadable on Steam Deck, and I'm so tired of intentionally obtuse Dark Souls-esque plots (or lack thereof) as a replacement for decent writing. I can't be bothered to care.

The setting has a wonderful grim vibe and the gameplay is tightly designed and feels great. Layout, art, music... everything is done well and integrates thoughtfully with everything else.

Pros:
-Exploration, like most Metroidvanias (i.e. Hollow Knight), is the heart and soul of this game
-Beautiful level design and artistic style. Anyone with a Christian background will find this game especially interesting (or blasphemous [lol])
-Large amount of enemy variety, Each enemy type has different optimal ways to approach and beat them (parrying, dodging, etc.) keeping things fresh
- Good combat system
-Fun boss fights

Cons:
- The main con, is that near the end of the game, things can become a slog. Meaning you have to take X Item to Y Person, but it is not obvious at all, and there is a lot of backtracking.
-  The lore and messaging is cryptic (they were clearly inspire by Dark Souls). To some, this is a good thing, but I can find it somewhat tedious, To avoid wandering around aimlessly trying to figure out where to go or what item you need next, would recommend looking up some guides near the end if you ever feel stuck.
- Similar to the above point, there are fast travel rooms, but they are not everywhere, meaning you often have to traverse large distances to get from Point A to Point B

Pros:
-amazing artstyle, something i definitely found really nice in this game is its artistic vision
-the bosses are definitely this game's unique selling point (besides escribar which was utter dogshit not bc he was hard but bc it's plain shit as for the game's vanilla final boss), though i think you should play blasphemous for the bosses ngl
-collectibles are nice, but im on a 50/50 here bc no clear incentives, or that it's just not interesting
-the execution animations are badass

Cons:
-lore, though as interesting and as cryptic as it tries to present it, falls flat and boring and uninteresting
-combat, though fun at first, is clunky and uninspired, the parry system is alright but the enemy attacks are so flat that the game sets you to basically just memorize a single pattern rather than having to think quick on your feet (if this game's inspiration is dark souls, it's totally different from that). This alone, makes me shake my head after defeating an enemy bc once youve seen the enemy once, there's nothing else the game has to offer but reskins
-Puzzles, platforming challenges are so damn basic


Final verdict:

6/10
It has its goods and the bads, but the game utterly shifts too hard on the bad side. The game had so much potential but I think was wasted by its overbearing lore and its fanaticism to it that it forgets its essence as a game. (bad combat mechanics, clunky controls, uninspired mapping, etc.). Clearly it tries to be novel at that, but utterly fails.

It's pacing is outright horrendous, either some areas feel too long or too short and there's never really a reason to go back once it's finished and it feels just like a chore (which fails as a metroidvania). The environment feels dead despite looking so gorgeous (and not dead lore-wise dead, but like, dead as if it was just there for the sake of it). Enemy variety good at first, then falls off super hard later in the game. Boss fights are great. Fuck the spikes.",1652156110,1685170625,True,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

This game was pretty good but initially there were a lot of things that turned me off, especially the snow area. Before I was complaining about the controls being finicky, but you just gotta get used to them. One of my favorite things in this game was the parry feature because it just feels insanely satisfying to land whenever you get it. The annoying part about it though, is that some enemies and bosses knock you back way too far, and it really messes with the fluidity of combat I'm afraid. Maybe there's something I missed that decreases knockback, idk. The fast travel system was good, but why use a completely separate screen for it? Having the names helps but it would have been better if you could select a portal from the map. My last complaint is that a lot of the collectibles you obtain blend in together, and it wouldn't be a problem but there's so many things you can equip. The only thing you can do to mitigate this is immediately checking your inventory because the game puts you in the section the item is supposed to be. Okay now for the good parts. The world was really fun to explore, and finding all the shortcuts was very rewarding. I enjoyed most of the boss designs and fights, especially the bridge boss. I think the bridge sequence was when my mind about the game changed. This is a very lore heavy game and I liked reading all the cool item descriptions and talking to NPCs. And lastly the difficulty of the game as a whole was good, but like I said, the beginning was kinda lame. The soundtrack is very solid too. Overall, I think Blasphemous was a good title.

But the gameplay just doesn't feel good. After playing other 2D combat platformers like Dead Cells and even Salt & Sanctuary, Blasphemous feels... clunky. I never got the hang of rolling, or even really figured out how it was supposed to work. Sometimes I would roll through an enemy, other times I would get stuck on them and take damage. Air combat, which is normally one of my favorite parts of 2D combat platformers, just didn't feel smooth at all.

Blasphemous has a great aesthetic and I'll applaud the devs for that, but the gameplay just didn't hook me like I thought it would.

It's A brilliant metroidvania but with flaws. I Finished the base game over 2 days with 15 hours in total, 80% completion. 

My 3 main gripes are in its sometimes questionable level design and often noticeable control unresponsiveness. Enemies are placed in certain environments that just made me think ""how on earth did they think this would be a good idea?"" And you'll often find yourself getting annoyed at hitting buttons and nothing happening or responding due to strange recovery times and hitbox collision, sometimes consequently putting you in stun-lock situations which is never enjoyable. Thirdly, there is a game mechanic that is horribly implemented. It's never stated at or hinted at, and involves getting to out of reach places that you would normally expect to access with a double-jump power up that doesn't exist. There is also a well known glitch that forced me to quit the game which still has not been fixed.

Despite these issues, man what a world they built. It is incredibly intense. It's very grim. In the world of Blasphemous, self punishment is virtuous. The themes and the aesthetic and the music all combine to draw you into this abyss that you just want to keep playing so you can get the hell out of there. It really sticks with you. 

When the aforementioned criticisms don't horribly present themselves, it's a tight and beautiful game that will leave you in contemplation for a while. 
It's probably on the high A tier below S tier metroidvanias such as Hollow Knight, Symphony of the Night and Ori 2. I imagine Blasphemous 2 will be up there if they figure out these imperfections and clean it up.

Highly recommended if you're into metroidvanias, for casual players try it out with the 2 hour refund window and if you like it then get it on sale as there are spikes in difficulty where the criticisms really begin to show that will be very frustrating to get through unless youre experienced with the metroidvania genre.

*Update*

Art Direction/Story/World - This game is honestly worth a buy just for the art direction.  The world, players, npcs, animations are all incredibly well done.  Music is solid.  Story is very abstract and hard to follow, some will like it some won't.  The world is compelling to explore but gets stale with backtracking.  I had a good twenty hours but the back tracking to get items / finish quests / corpse runs just kill the mood for me.   Corpse running is a thing and it's sometimes ok and sometimes not.

Combat - Solid 2D souls like combat which is mostly good.  Relies on basic attacks.  Parrying/Dodging/Jumping is required to win.  No Unga Bunga.   Few gripes about combat:  as the game progresses landing combo's becomes a bigger and bigger part of your damage profile and poke damage gets weaker.  many enemies seem coded to punish you for going for combo's with attack windows that always seem just shorter then your combo animation.  at times ranged combat and platforming mix and it can be very cheap.    your parry always protects you from damage but many strong attacks will knock you and it feels bad as you can't counterattack and sometimes will get knocked off a cliff and die.  Unlike other games you can't dodge through projectiles.

Progression is bad.   You use the same weapon the whole game, it does more damage but there's no visual changes and enemies just die in 1 hits instead of 2.  Most items are weak passives that are not interesting.  ie you take less fire dmg.  they cant be used to create fun 'builds'.   opening the UI to tinker is immersion breaking and tedious.  magic spells are so expensive they might as well not exist, they mostly useless except to 1 shot trash.   Too late for a redesign now, hopefully the sequel gets it right.

Let me get one thing clear: the game's pretty damn rough. In my personal experience, the game started off impossibly difficult and felt really unrewarding, I was being reintegrated into the soil every 5 minutes, later though, after getting the hang of controls, it started getting pretty fun. Just keep in mind the fact, that it's my personal experience, and I might have a skill issue.
The gameplay feels really good and the attacks are diverse and actually useful. There are some bugs here and there, which made me reset the game because I, or an enemy got stuck in the wall for some unknown reason. The lore of this game is very deep, but let me tell you: it does an awful job at telling you what's going on or how to finish a side quest, so I feel like some sort of in-game list would be something very helpful. I love the variety of enemies, bosses, said quests and especially stunning graphics. The soundtrack is great, though to be honest, I have not paid a lot of attention to it. In terms of replay value, the game will blast you into the shadow realm again and offer way more content after you already finish the game, so you are rewarded for going for it again.

-SO MANY small bugs riddle this game, I can't begin to describe all of them out of frustration.
the controls are very buggy and frustrating. just awful.
the frame rate is stuttery and is capped at 60
the screen shakes up and down upon entering new rooms.
dropping down into lower sections [spoiler]using Abyss-Traversing item[/spoiler] does NOT work because the VINES bug out and don't extend in time, and you can't steer Penitent-One while dropping through those specific sections, but you can steer him in other sections that don't have vines and stuff?? it makes those sections of the map LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE... Unless [spoiler]you send the elevator down, go all the way around and up to the Prie Dieu, go to the elevator room left of the Prie Dieu and drop down from there[/spoiler]. seems pretty forced, doesn't it :/
in certain boss fights, you CANNOT get hit. If you get his, the Penitent-One gets knocked down and takes much longer time to get up than it takes the boss to go wailing on the Penitent-One, preventing him from doing anything.
A LOT OF WALKING! So much walking that it made me quit the game many, many times because of how boring it was.
unlike Dark Souls(which this Blasphemous is obviously inspired by. Blasphemous has a lot of walking and going around areas just to open shortcuts. now, that is similar to Dark Souls, isn't it? Well, in here, the journey to open the shortcut is empty and boring and the only objective is to open the shortcut. you might find a thing or two along the way but, it's still really, really boring and feels pointless and remain trivial throughout the game.

Furthermore, checkpoints are so few and far in between, most of my experience was running for a couple of minutes to the place where I died, only to die again and start over.

With its dark and atmospheric world, the game manages to strike a delicate balance between reverence and blasphemy, offering a unique exploration of faith and redemption.

One of the standout features of Blasphemous is its impeccable attention to detail in depicting the intricate religious imagery. From ornate cathedrals to haunting statues and somber rituals, every element of the game's environment contributes to the overall sense of religious mystique. The symbolism is deeply ingrained in the gameplay mechanics, story, and character design, enhancing the thematic depth and immersing players in a world filled with spiritual connotations.

Beyond its aesthetic appeal, Blasphemous excels in gameplay mechanics and level design. The combat is satisfyingly challenging, requiring precise timing and strategic thinking. As players progress through the game, they uncover a meticulously crafted narrative, gradually unraveling the mysteries of the world and their character's role in it. The lore is engrossing, blending elements of religion, mythology, and dark fantasy, keeping players invested in the unfolding story.

Blasphemous is not only visually stunning but also succeeds in creating an atmosphere of contemplation and introspection. It prompts players to question their own beliefs and assumptions, as well as the nature of faith itself. The game's ability to provoke deep thought while providing an engaging gameplay experience is a testament to its excellence.

In conclusion, Blasphemous stands as a remarkable achievement in the world of video games. Its skillful incorporation of Christian-esque symbolism, captivating aesthetics, and thought-provoking themes make it an unforgettable journey for players seeking an immersive and intellectually stimulating experience.

The pixel art is stunning, every back drop is a painting and every character is bursting with lore.

The music by Carlos Viola is beautiful, crafted to capture the mood of every area and boss - and is super relaxing to boot!

Aesthetics aside, the combat is the star of the show; far weightier and complex than any other 2d Metroidvania. The game has some great areas to explore, and backtracking.

Even a wise penitent like me knows nothing of what lies beyond those high walls.

However, what I do know is that, according to The Rule, one must carry out the Three Humiliations to gain access to what they guard.

One of them must be performed in the high mountains, covered in thick blankets of snow and ice.

Another in the depths of a dark, entombed church, where the sleeper lies.

The game's graphics are utterly terrific and it's dedication to style and form are incredible. The enemy character design (especially of the bosses) is so artistic and gruesome that it's impossible not to feel immersed. I really don't hate the combat, although it is definitely meant to challenge you are force you to adapt most of the time it doesn't feel unreasonably difficult, once you understand how the combat runs it is very rewarding to be challenged by seemingly impossible odds that force you to cleverly apply the skills you've learned. 
My problem is entirely with the progression and recovery after deaths. Progression in the game is so obscure and difficult that it will seem at times like it is utterly stagnant. You don't level up by winning battles with enemies and gaining experience; you level up by exploring. Which would not be a huge problem if the game didn't make exploration so hard. There is no practical fast travel system for one, and the map which you are given is hieroglyphically difficult to understand because entire rooms are represented by boxes, which means you could have a room with a thousand enemies and inescapable traps look the same as a perfectly innocent room with an item you want. If you want to level up you have to find hidden Mea Culpa alters strewn throughout the map in increasingly obscure locations. If you want more healing potions you've got to discover more blood alters which are incredibly hard to find. 
As far as recovering from successive deaths the penalties for dying in the game not only stack but alleviating the penalties will require you to hunt out each individual location at which you died and recover all of your corpses. This may result (as it did for me) in you dying in the poison gas and not being able to recover your body until much later in the game or in your body somehow ending up on the other side of a wall which you won't be able to access until much later in the game. 
I would recommend this game only to the incredibly patient or immensely masochistic because it certainly has redeeming qualities, I just don't think I could describe it as a 'fun game' in good conscience.",1684467013,1684467013,False,2,0,0.511945366859436035,0,True,False,False

There was some point that I didn't know what is the goal of my main character. 
5/10

Game-play: I think this is the part where this game shines (until you start playing for achievements) - 
everything was feeling so smooth, every mechanics - everything had good impact in the game - 
from the basic attack, to special mechanics, which were dependable on relics. 
But for the achievements there were a lot of bugs, like big head of wax - you actually have all ingredients, 
but you still don't have a big head of wax. And this is just a simple example.
9/10

Difficulty: For me, this was bad - as a veteran Souls player, the bosses were pretty easy. 
For non-souls players, I think this will be sweet difficulty.

There are some enemies that just feel way too tanky, regardless of how many upgrades you have which makes backtracking to do quests a bit of a slog. 

Another save point or two in certain areas would be really beneficial. 

It's easy to get into areas you really shouldn't be in yet and run up against a huge difficulty spike. 

The platforming can be....hit or miss with insta-kill spikes and bottomless pits like we're suddenly playing Megaman again which doesn't feel great in a game with long run-backs and some tanky enemies. 

The quests, the items, the triggers for stages of certain NPC quests, and what you have to do can be really incredibly cryptic. I usually try to avoid using a wiki the first time through a game but I couldn't avoid it this time to figure out what certain items or for or what certain NPCs are asking me to do.

Powerups are kind of a mess with lots of weird limitations like: why so many types? you've got sword skills that are different from sword hearts which is different still from sword level. Magic Spells. Combat relics, which are different from exploration relics. The latter have no combat impact but we can only ever equip three so you constantly have to juggle them - why not let us equip them all at once? The combat relics sometimes have cryptic or poorly written descriptions and it's hard to know which are good or worthwhile. 

THAT SAID, I am enjoying it quite a lot. The challenge is there. The enjoyment is there. The music is wonderful - I feel like you don't hear many games that rely heavily on spanish guitar. The visuals are excellent. The boss design is creative and astounding (even if the actual difficulty of them is all over the place).

That's not to say that Blasphemous doesn't have anything going for it. The art direction is incredible. The music is great. It's overall a fun and satisfying experience. 

But this game has some problems. 

The biggest issue I had with this game was my inputs getting eaten constantly. I can't tell you how many times I tried to jump,  attack, or use a prayer, and the game refused to register it. This got me killed quite a few times, and it never felt fair. 

The platforming in this game is pretty bad. For me, that's mainly because the player character automatically grabs ledges instead of requiring an input be held to trigger this interaction. This takes away player agency and results in your character grabbing ledges when you want to fall or grabbing ledges with poor timing. I hate it. The platforming really stands out as frustrating during the (optional) Miriam challenge rooms. These rooms are poorly designed and frustrating messes. The reward you get for completing them isn't very good either, so I recommend skipping them if you value your sanity (I wish I had done so).

Playing this game after Hollow Knight, the combat feels really lacking, especially in the boss fights. Most of the boss fights are focused on spectacle, so you end up fighting a lot of things that are much bigger than you where it's just about surviving attack hell type phases long enough to land a few hits in when the boss becomes vulnerable for a couple seconds.

I won't elaborate on the positives, because a lot of people here have added very positive reviews that I agree with, but I can't get past how some things are just plain badly designed. I really liked one comment on Reddit that the game is designed to suffer, but that doesn't mean it should be specifically ""badly"" designed, well, unless that was 100% the goal.

Fighting mobs:

- when you deal the final blow to a mob, and at that moment the mob jumps/does an animation/attack, the mob will only die when the animation ends

- some mobs can not be dodged at all, I totally do not understand why, some mobs can be dodged by dodge, and some can not. I understand that some of them can be jumped over, but there are mobs, impossible to bypass

- sometimes I had the impression that the AI is sensitive to the moment when I finally press the button, which makes it impossible to avoid the attack (I may be wrong here)

- it often happened to me that mobs would shoot from off-screen

Character movement/attack:

- I don't know if it's just with me, but it often happened to me that the dodge + attack didn't work at all, it seems to me that when the dodge animation ends it no longer catches the attack for that, which is strange because the dodge animation is still going on

- if I did a dodge + attack on a mob that was on a ridge and you sat special then usually your character's animation was off the ridge and after the animation was over you would drop down

- when you get damage that knocks you down and you are lying on the ground then when you get up you don't have that momentary immortality, so if you fell somewhere where there are mobs you will be eaten

- I had the impression that the hit box on some mobs was much bigger and on others it was small and you had to get close to the mobs

- I don't remember the name of the boss, but it was a skeleton that was held by the hands, a few times it happened to me that half of the boss went beyond the screen which made it impossible to beat the hands so that the boss could fall down

Map design:

- personally, I'm not a fan of returning to the same location several times each, and I love to collect everything, here I had the impression that I really returned to the same locations several times each (this is my personal feeling, I know that a lot of people like this kind of map)

- some traps can not be avoided without receiving damage, as is the case in the map Mourning and Havoc, no matter how long I calculated and counted, there were moments that electric balls could not be skipped without damage

I really feel bad issuing a negative comment and frustration is certainly speaking through me. I love this type of game, ""souls-like"" 2D, but some of the things designed in this game are, in my opinion, bad, which led me to great frustration and dislike of the game. I felt completely different when I tried to progress some map or boss state in other games and knew what I needed to improve. Despite my negative attitude, I'm still very eager to make an approach to the second part, because the game is beautiful and made with a really cool idea.",1684281739,1684281739,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'll play it to say I beat it, but after that, I'll never play it again.
 I get being hard and punishing, but being badly designed with artificial difficulty based around blind jumps into insta-kill spikes and pits, having multiple enemies on screen that can stunlock you to death, and a dodge that is all but useless because if you happen to touch something after you take damage is different than hard.

This becomes especially apparent for the later collaborative Bloodstained game challenges. The three challenges I've done so far aren't even bad considering prior experience with Path of Pain for Hollow Knight, but there's consistent spotty input for ladders when you're jumping onto them. This will ruin some of the later Bloodstained challenges. Ladder input is extremely exacerbated when you're required to jump from one ladder to another. You press UP on the ladder when Penitente's helmet/torso (both don't improve outcome for grabbing it) are in the same space, and it takes 5-6 times to register even after dying during each attempt. The best examples are early on during the ladder jump prior to Where Olive Trees Whither, and the initially locked climb to the Walls of Holy Prohibitions. I hope its resolved for the release of the second game if they desire to implement more platforming environments. A lot of people have complaints about the combat that I understand. I've done all existing boss fights without any real issues, until one of the final fights (Crisanta) that jacks up combat speed for the first time. The fight is one of the most poorly designed fights in the game so far (haven't done NG+) because while it's not difficult to parry the attacks, you very frequently end up auto riposting after a parry even when you're not pressing the attack button. The bug is very noticeable, and was honestly tempted to give up the game since I really doubt it's going to get fixed. The auto riposte on paper sounds alright. However, every time the bug happens Penitente's attack swings out of reach of Crisanta, in one of the few openings to attack after the constant parrying of attacks. The glaring issues from this fight alone make me reluctant to try the second game if their intention is to add more fast, challenging fights like Crisanta to the mix, without rectifying control responsiveness. It's definitely worth trying on sale for the art and story, albeit the plot draws many similarities to Elden Ring and Bloodborne.

PROS
====
- Incredible, dynamic music.
- Amazing voice acting, it's just perfect for every character and for the story.
- Great lore and story. The whole ""reason"" behind what happens and why in Cvstodia is both interesting and shocking.
- Mechanics are smooth, easy to learn, evolving, and most important of all... fun!
- Environment and background are superb! Great thematic and scenery, which merges seamlessly with the music and the gameplay.
- Character design is super interesting! There's a little bit of everything and each level area (called districts) has its own set of unique enemies and bosses.
- Tons of content for us completionists! You can just chill and beat the game, or go for broke and collect every single thing you can! (rewards really help with tougher areas).
- Gameplay is enticing and challenging! A combination of Metroidvania + Dark Souls makes the game punishing but very satisfying to beat.

CONS
====
- Some of the quests can be tough to figure out w/o a guide.
- One of the quests is ""timed"" (kinda).
- The game CAN be a bit tough for certain players, since as you make progress the enemies/obstacles/mechanics become more challenging.
- The whole ""retro"" look and feel, VFX, cinematics and pixel-style can be off-putting for players who value realistic/modern graphics over gameplay.
- That stupid speedrun that one of the DLCs add (fu Miriam level 5!!!)

Conclusion

Once I saw the amazing pixel art and goriness of the game, I knew I had to try it. I'm happy to say this is probably one of my new favorite games now, I had so much fun.

In a world full of strife and self harm (trigger warning), you awaken simply known as the Penitent One of Silence. Awakening in a mass of other penitent bodies, you fight off the warden, take his blood, and begin your journey on finding the next Miracle and breaking the curse over the land.

Blasphemous is a metroidvania that looks like the Castlevania and Dark Souls universes had a baby. While the pixel art and graphics look like Castlevania, the story and feel are akin to playing a Dark Souls game. You have good array of abilities once you start: Attack, Dodge, and Parry. Each of these moves are crucial if you're going to survive this game because it's tough...but fun.

Exploration in this game is so much fun and just like Castlevania, there are hidden rooms and paths for you to find. Tons of collectables, equipment that gives you active and passive abilities, and so much more. This was one of the few games where I actually looked forward to backtracking because you never know where a hidden wall was, or what new maps you can access now that you have new abilities.

Enemies are quite varied which was a cool thing in my book. You rarely see the same enemy in different areas as they each have their own theme. It's always fascinating to go into a new place and go like ""Okay, how does this one fight?"". It keeps the game fresh and exciting. Also, this game is quite bloody and gory. So another thing to look forward to is how does it look when I crush these enemies with my sword *grin*

The highlight for me was definitely the bosses. Every boss was memorable and so much fun. Upon first seeing them, they seem imposing and super hard. But after taking your time, learning their attack patterns, and LEARNING TO PARRY *hint* some of their attacks, it become some of the most rewarding parts of the game for me. Even when I found myself stuck on a boss for a few tries, I never felt mad at the boss, I was mad at myself. I never blamed the game and that always feels good to say. 

Lastly, the death system is really good in my opinion as well. When you die in the game, you gain guilt which makes your magic bar (fervor) gets smaller and it becomes harder for you to gain money to buy things and upgrade. You can go back to wear you died and absorb the guilt to get your fervor fixed, or you can find certain rooms in the game that will fix your guilt for a cost. Your money is never affected by death which made it so much better for me as a player. It gives you a Dark Souls like experience without the rough punishment. I know more hardcore gamers wanted it tougher upon death, but I personally thought this was fine for players who may have found it unplayable. Perhaps there can be an option they add later for players who want a challenge?

I personally had no gripes with the game. It was hard at points, but it was never so hard that I wanted to quit. It was just the right amount of challenge to keep me going. Even boss fights that had me sweating at first had me take my time and really play more patient and then I got the hang of it. Aside from a graphical glitch I had on an elevator in one area and sometimes my character clipping when grabbing a ledge during a challenge run, everything was perfect!

Final verdict? If you love Metroidvanias, you are doing yourself a disservice by not playing this game. This was the perfect game from beginning to end. Plus at the time of this review, it is spooky season. So it's an even better time to pick this up and enjoy all the gory and crazy action in this game. You won't regret it, I promise!

The gameplay is serviceable, it just feels like a less smooth Hollow Knight with way less combat depth. The story is nonsensical bullshit, an attempt at creating world lore that falls short when you realize everybody is speaking in riddles with no clear distinction who they're even talking about. People want to compare this to Dark Souls NPC questlines but that's a stretch. This game does absolutely nothing to clue you in on any of the multiple sidequests or item progressions. Even when you do come across an NPC and manage to give them something the follow-up dialogue is always cryptic bullshit. ""Take this egg with you, go see the tree, be with the father etc."" it's all flavor text trash that serves no purpose for the actual game progression. Eventually I started skipping all the dialogue because I realized absolutely none of it was helpful or even mattered, Not to mention one of the VAs couldn't even pronounce pious correctly (come on if you're going this heavy with the biblical themes at least get your shit straight).

The game is rife with secrets and hidden items/questlines but fuck you if you think you're gonna stumble across one and actually finish it correctly. A lot of these boil down to ""meet with X before Y but NOT BEFORE fighting boss Z, then take item A to NPC B then leave and come back, take new item A to random ass tree in early game area, receive new relic, re-explore the whole map looking for random blood platforms or vines, and finally oh look you found a wack ass bead that is totally obsolete by this point. If that wasn't enough I would later find that I fucked myself out of the ""true"" ending and that I'd have to do a whole other run for completion's sake. This all on top of the game crashing on me a couple times and also being wonky with Steam Deck cloud saves; I'm just soured on this whole game and I'm gonna leave it at 90% completion because I can't be fucked to care about it anymore, it stopped being fun and I don't care about a sequel.",1682888257,1682888257,False,5,4,0.519264757633209229,0,True,False,False

It's one of the better metroidvanias even if it does feel a little sluggish at times but it's good, give it ago if you're into 2D classic Souls like games cos this is awesome.

I got it on Steam and it is as great as I remember it being, so I felt inclined to write a review. The best parts of this game, in my opinion, is the controls, gameplay and the lore. The controls are very tight an are very responsive, especially when the game asks you to pull off difficult platforming and maneuvers throughout the game. The gameplay loop is actually really fun because not only the combat very mechanically simple, but slowly gets more complex, the game acts like a Metroidvania at some points, asking you to come back later with a specific item or ability. However, it's only for collectibles and such, not progression, so it's not forceful with getting these items and abilities. Finally, the lore and the artsyle, which I want to pair together, is easily the best part of the game. Now, I love Dark Souls and the lore that you can choose to slowly unravel, learning about the world and the NPCs and characters in the game, absent or not. The way that Blaspehemous handles lore is that they give you a lot of information about your character and the world around you in the very beginning that you have to interpret for yourself and the NPCs you meet along the way add more to that lore and somehow feeling very interesting and complex after meeting them one time. Now, the artstyle is baffling. The way they portray gore, the intricate details of the NPC's designs and the many locations you encounter is crazy. You'll understand what I mean when you play it, hopefully. There isn't really any cons I would say about this game. The one thing I could say could be improved would be the bosses as they are pretty easy once you get used to the patterns and the gameplay, but that's not really a bad thing. Also, a few areas are kind of difficult in a way they are sometimes unfair, but these are just nitpicks. They're designed really well, so it's not a huge flaw. Before I finish this review, I want to give a disclaimer. This game is really graphic, like blood, guts, nudity and adult themes. It might not seem like it would be bad because of the pixelated artstyle, but it's really bad. I know Steam says this already, but you might not want to play this in public or around other people.

It's been a long time since a game has made me more annoyed so consistently for such a long period of time. It's not even that the game is difficult, it's that the game just throws dozens of enemies at you in a straight line while platforming above 1 hit kill spikes and has some of the most basic 2D sword based combat i've ever experienced.
When there is a decent enemy encounter that requires you to git gud it just goes back to the same old stupid bs that it's been doing for the previous 4 hours right afterward.
The platforming is pretty awful, the jumping feels slow and laggy and the platforms are so inconsistent when you connect, sometimes i'm standing right on top but i fall right through and the constant barrage of flying enemies and projectiles towards the end is so insufferable I want to break my controller. I'm gonna see it through to the end purely out of spite and the fact that I'm probably almost done. The area I'm in right now is essentially just Tower of Latria from Demon's Souls with even worse enemy design and level design.
Update: Christana might be one of the worst designed bosses I have ever fought. Why is she allowed to start the animation of her overhead swing then change direction 180 when you slide through her body to hit you? Is it a way of saying ""you're supposed to parry?"" why would that be a good idea, there should be multiple ways of dodging each attack, the boss literally punishes you for dodging her blow. Why is it that when I slide beneath her as she does her dive-bomb attack, she can cancel it before she hits the ground then immediately start it back up again and hit me with it the second time? Why is it that I can run to the other side of the arena wait for 3 seconds see her do nothing, drink my bile flask and then after I've regained the health but before I'm out of the animation lock of drinking the flask she can charge across the entire arena to hit me? Why make the bile flask heal you instantly but still animation lock you for an extra second and a half anyway if not to make it so that you take unavoidable damage by enemies when you have downtime in a fight but only after you heal? Why is it that I need to sacrifice my number of healing charges to barely increase the amount of healing that I get from those charges? It seems like everything in this game is meant to be an imitation of what Dark Souls difficulty is supposed to be like while missing the entire point of what makes those games challenging to begin with. Maybe I just don't understand the genre and will never like metroidvanias, I'm fine with that. But this game is one of the most poorly designed and balanced experiences I've ever had with a game in my life. The only things it has going for it are a great art style, beautiful music, and somewhat engaging lore.

First thing first, Blasphemous is a pixel-art masterpiece. Game looks awfully gorgeous, all the visual aspects of this game are blowing my mind.
 
Second, after all the DLC's, the game has a more complete story and lore than in 2020, when I played this game for the first time. Bunch of religious themes with amaj to the history, made the game story more interesting, to me at list. 

Third, the gameplay of this game, after a lot of patches, is really good. Blasphemous can provide the players battle system with nice progression and variety. Cool bosses, ofcourse, included.

Fourth. World exploration. If you like the metroidvania genre with a bunch of secrets that you need to find, this game is for you. Blasphemous has a lot of interesting secret stuff.

My gripes are that the game is super slow for an action platformer, the secrets are hidden behind just hitting random walls until you get the relic that tells you when there's a secret in the room. I think the game needed more movement options as the restrictive moveset was boring or agitating at many times. The game is a bit too punishing with platforming as well, the instant-kill pitfalls and spikes really made this game longer than it needed to be, especially when the stage design intended for enemies to hit you into instant-kill spikes. This game's relic system shouldn't even exist, all relics active all the time. There is no downside to only having 3 active at all, it just means that its less menu navigating, all the relics are passive abilities that are more or less required to progress or find secrets within the world. The combat feels good when it works, but oftentimes enemies won't let you finish your combo, so it's only really used in bossfights or on certain enemies. The combo should go off regardless if the attack hits or not. I also believe there should be more ways to view collectables within the map, scouring the map for them with no helpful indication of where they could be late game makes finishing up all the sidequests a very annoying ordeal. 

I do like the game's music and artstyle, it is a very pretty game, and the spritework is absurdly good. the world is interesting enough to keep me playing despite all of my gripes with it. The bossfights do feel good, and the map is quite large so there's a lot to do. I hope blasphemous 2 addresses alot of the core issues I had with this game since its a pretty good game already, with a few QoL tweaks and some more movement (which blasphemous 2 seems to address) the game could be extremely good. 
 
6/10 game for me personally, I enjoyed it and hated it at the same time.

Steam doesn't have that, but I want to say it either way. I'm not recommending it mainly because of my own experience with the game.

I also wanna say that this game has an amazing story when you actually understand shit (thanks youtube) but a game can't be carried solely by its story.

Blasphemous is a great game that suffers from poor design choices. It's a good game but a bad metroidvania. You can play the game normally, finish the first ending and stop there and the experience will be pretty good. There are some issues here and there like annoying platforming but it's not that bad. The game is fairly quick with an average playtime of 14 hours (if you stop at the first ending), but it has a lot of good going for it. The art is disgustingly gorgeous, and the sound design doesn't disappoint. The music is very good and the pixel art works great. The voice acting is pretty good too.
Now, the story is complicated. The concept is great but I feel like it gets way more confusing than it should. I only realized a crucial part of the story after watching (not playing, btw) the true ending. And the whole ""silent protagonist"" thing doesn't really work because you can't really tell what is really happening or if it is good or bad.

The gameplay is pretty simple and again, I'm neutral towards this. The combat never really evolves, it's just ""hit enemy, wait for parry, sometimes use spell when enemy is too annoying, heal after a few hits"". The bosses are just very simple and all very similar, even if their designs would make you think otherwise. Upgrades don't really matter too, I barely touched my upgrades and I was fine through the whole game. Same goes for charms/rosary beads and spells/prayers. You're only ever gonna use a few that you find good and not change them much. 
One thing that is very annoying is how the map works. It's awful. It is good that you don't need to unlock anything to actually use it, but there is basically no information on where the stuff you need is. Every part of the map is composed of little squares, so important things that can be remembered because of how they look are impossible to identify just by looking at the map. The most it shows you is checkpoints and a few places where you can upgrade things like bile flasks or rosary beads. There are some babies in cages that you have to save and a place where you can get rewards for doing so and I genuinely forgot that it EXISTED or where it even was. It's like grubs from HK but done badly. You NEED to mark everything otherwise you're not gonna find what you want.

One thing that I personally find negative is that the game doesn't have any ACTUAL character upgrades like a metroidvania usually does. In Control, you can fly, throw objects and create shields out of thin air. In Hollow Knight you have Monarch Wings and Shadow Cloak and Crystal Dash. In Fallen Order you have Double Jump, Force Push and Wall Run. but here, you have nothing. Instead, the game gives you collectible (also optional) items that not only need to be equipped but just change the world around you, not really evolving the character in any way. And the worst part is that they are only useful for a handful of collectibles. Again, I'm not totally against this because it is very unique but it's also not very fun.

Also, and this connects with the map being shit, unlocking things here is VERY HARD without a wiki. I spent a good 4 hours just trying to get the vine relic (which again, I barely fucking used) and eventually I did but not after sweeping the ENTIRE map after it. Worst part is it was hidden in a remote part of the map which I didn't notice because the indication that there are access points in any given part of the map is a little hole inside the wall that is VERY easy to ignore. I could've done that in 10 minutes tops but the lack of information made it THE chore.

And then we have the endings. There are 3 in total, only the first 2 are actual achievements and while I LOVE the idea of following a different plot that absolutely changes the story and sets up a better ending for the game, the execution here is awful. Not only do you need to completely redo the game (which would be fine if the game played better) to get the true ending but everything is so specific I don't think I could've done any of that even after months of trying without online help. I get that it's big and it matters, but there is hardly any challenge here other than following specific steps from the wiki. You don't even get an achievement for it, so you can just look it up on YT and be done with it. And that's not the only thing that suffers from ""restart syndrome"", there are quests that can only be finished by playing the game's NG+ which just sucks. I'm fine with NG+ being different, I really like that, but you can't start something in one mode and the force the player to redo the whole thing because you can only finish it in a different one. And to top it all off, NG+ replaces your main save, essentially forcing you to redo anything you left undone on that save.

Also, platforming. Stop with the fatal damage pits and spikes, it's fucking annoying. There's this endgame room with a prie dieu on the middle surrounded by platforms and pits and it's intentionally made to trigger players. It doesn't make the game harder, and breaks the flow of gameplay by making you restart and die just because you mistimed a jump

Overall, I was able to enjoy the game at first even with a lacking combat system but trying to explore it and find secrets was very annoying. I'm leaving the review as not recommended because of my experience, but honestly it wasn't that bad and I'm fairly neutral towards it. 5/10",1664240905,1681981109,False,10,0,0.570127665996551514,0,True,False,False

Edit: I first made this review when I didn't really have the words to describe this game, and how I enjoyed it. So I shall do this now. 
Pros: oh my god, this is glorious. The entire game has this specific vibe that is just wonderful and Gothic and lowkey horrific. Honestly, Prophecies by Philip Glass (song on YouTube) can describe the vibe pretty good. And the art...THE ART MY GUYS. As an artist, I tend to look at other art closely, and I ADORE the art in this game. The use colours, the character design, how the main character's colour palette subtlety changes depending on the area you are in, the boss design, the level design, I go on. Honestly, I would also recommend perching the Art Book as well if you're interested in that sort of thing. And the story, it's wonderful. The NPCs, interesting. I could praise the writing of this game for the rest of my life too. But as for the game game, the game itself. It honestly has this similar feeling to Dark Souls. You get this feeling of progressing with the more bosses you over come to beat the game. At least when I defeated a really challenging boss, I felt accomplished. Like I can do this, I will do this. And also, some abilities you get in the game 1. look really cool (the art is amazing) and 2. are really useful imo. Also x2, there is this feeling in combat that I would describe as smooth. Like, for me at least it was pretty easy to get the hang of it when I started because so how clean it was. 
And now I do want to share some cons about the game so that if someone is interested in playing they can be informed before hand. And to start, I personally don't like some of the enemy mechanics. Some enemies have the ability to stun lock you in areas. it's not fun. And I personally don't like how when you fall into spikes/the void you instantly die, it's not fun in the early game. But that's all that I would see as a con in this game.
this review is very long oh dear.

Criticism: The game has a ton of backtracking, which wouldn't be a huge deal if the game told you how to unlock the better fast travel. It's bearable without it, but for the love of god please donate to the church if you want to spare yourselves the pain.  Also, there are several DLC bosses that are only unlocked after NG+.

[b] The Metroidvania that dare to ask: How can we out-Catholic the entire Castlevania franchise? [/b]

The objectively great thing about this game is the visuals, the gnarly hellish imagery sculpted as high quality pixel artwork. The visual theming is [b] strong. [/b] Almost everything in this game is beautiful [b] and [/b] ugly in all the right ways. Some enemies and bosses will make you ask yourself: what the flying seraphim inspired this? 

Now, the rest of the game.

The combat: it's good enough. The parrying/execution mechanic is fun. Melee attacks have impact to them. The blood projectile is okay. Didn't really utilize all the magic skills tho.

Boss fights: I won't say they're all fun per se. They're ""manageable."" They're Metroidvania bosses, they can be mindless to deal with, some of them. Brute forcing through some of them is possible. There's like one difficult ""Artorias"" rival boss because of course, everyone's a Dark Souls fan. 

Mobility's alrite. Exploration's pretty standard. Side quests are okay. 
The story's probably great but I don't care.
The amount of collectibles are laboriously criminal.
Some neat secrets to find.

Oh, and the devs played Hollow Knight's Path of Pain and it shows.

Above all, I really like the extra costumes. I appreciate that for real.

Eh, the game's fun.
It's better than Valfaris, that's for sure.

[hr][/hr]
Lets start with the good:
- Artistically speaking, the presentation of this game is absolutely gorgeous. It takes an extremely unique setting and renders it beautifully. Every area, enemy, and NPC adds to the brutal atmosphere that encompasses the entire game.
- Adding to the above, the music. The OST is mostly atmospheric, with few tracks I would listen to on their own, but overall it perfectly complements the vibe each area is going for.
- With a couple exceptions, the bosses stand out as highlights. Each one feels different enough that they're each able to provide a unique challenge. I enjoyed optimizing my setup for each encounter and trying new things for some of the extra difficult DLC bosses. 

Asides from the above, standard enemy combat in this game feels OK. Some ranged enemies can be pretty BS, and certain enemies feel like they take ages to die, but overall the hack and slash combat is decent most of the time. When it [i]isn't[/i] decent, is typically when it overlaps with the platforming.

The bad really boils down to two major issues:
- The platforming. The Penitent One controls like he has stepped in molasses, and he basically stays covered in molasses the whole game. At best, the platforming is slow. When unimpeded, it's mostly just a lot of sluggish wall jumps and short hops over spikes. However when also fighting enemies at the same time, the slow platforming quickly turns frustrating, overshadowing the otherwise solid action gameplay. 
- Trying to figure out what anything does. Look, I get it. Dark Souls does it so why don't we do it here. NPCS speak in catholic riddles, key item descriptions often have [i]zero[/i] words describing what the item is actually used for, and questlines are easily failable by accident. I failed an npc questline before I ever met them, because I had the absolute [i]gall[/i] to walk into an area, then immediately leave that area because I wanted to complete it later. I quickly resolved myself to just looking stuff up, which sucks because this game has a lot of things that go best unspoiled.

Overall, Blasphemous is great when it's great, but it can be an obtuse, frustrating experience too. I have several friends who bounced off of the first few hours of Blasphemous and never came back, and I don't really blame them for doing so.",1680679043,1680679295,False,1,1,0.5,0,True,False,False

[list]
[*] The controls feel like utter garbage. A game that's three parts platformer, metroidvania, and Souls-like [i]needs[/i] to have fluid, tight, responsive controls. Blasphemous fails to get anywhere near close to that for me and playing it was an act of frustration, exasperated by what felt like pure RNG on whether the PC would properly latch onto a platform or plunge into an insta-kill abyss and/or insta-kill set of spikes, or properly execute an ability.
    
[*] Speaking of insta-kill traps, why? In this style of game? In any style of game past the NES era, 37 years ago? This isn't an arcade game, the developers don't get a quarter every time a player falls victim to OHKO traps, there's no reason to have them other than to infuriate the player as they fight against the controls trying not to die to them. They don't even have the good graces to disable once you clear an area, so all the backtracking you're going to do? Have fun navigating that tedious padding [i]every, single, time.[/i] 

[*] Areas seem designed with how frustrating they can be first and foremost. From trap and enemy placement to simple navigation, it wasn't satisfying, fun, or rewarding for me to explore the world. The bare-bones map exasperated this, especially since if I didn't neurotically cover the map in icons (that you can't label) when there were items I couldn't reach yet or if I found an NPC, off I'd go ALT-TABing to make sure I was limiting my exposure to the pure, condensed extract of misery that is playing this game.

[*] The font style sapped my usual passion for delving into a setting's lore and world building. It's painful-looking and hard to read, bordering on illegible. Low-res, pixelated art can be great, and a lot of Blasphemous [i]does[/i] look good, but committing to that bit to the point you make reading as arduous as possible, which you're going to be doing a [i]ton[/i] of in this game, is baffling to me.
[/list]

I don't know whether to be impressed or disappointed a game inspired by and exemplifying the self-hatred and self-flagellation brought on by religious fanaticism manages to emulate those concepts with every fiber of its being, but I do know that there's an innumerable amount of other platformers/metroidvanias/Souls-likes out there that are [i]actually[/i] fun to play, and I recommend spending your time with them instead.

I *want* to like this game.  It's a Metroidvania with some challenging combat, voice acted lore bits, and subversive christian aesthetic.  However, three aspects of the game teamed up to make sure that it resulted in an unfun experience.
1) your character is not a good platformer and is not speedy.  More NES Belmont, less Ori/Hollow Knight.
2) the world is full of platforming mechanics with instant-death like pits and spikes.
3) every death requires a backtrack from a save point, and remember, your character is not speedy.

This turned exploration into a trudge.  At best you make it a little further each time and eventually get to another save point.  At worse, you backtrack just to fail the jump again because, remember, your character is clunky.

I went from invested and interested in the art, lore, and combat to deciding it wasn't worth the backtrack.  This game needs either a sands of time rewind or the ability to restart at the screen you died on in the event of a platforming issue.  The combat being hard is just fine.  It feels fair, it feels good.  But your character is not built well for the navigation it is being asked to do.",1680464210,1680464210,False,0,4,0.436507940292358398,0,True,False,False

My main gripe about the game is just how disappointed I am in it. As someone who is a fan of both the metriodvania like games and dark fantasy genre, I had hoped that it would be just a little more fulfilling. And while Blasphemous definitely meets that expectation, if you plan on getting this game, prepare for a noticeable difficulty spike in the midgame and lategame areas.

Gameplay for the exploration and mob fighting is fairly rhythmic and slower paced than that of the bosses, which are far faster.
Speaking of bosses, all of them are unique, for better or for worse. The early game bosses are as to be expected, large monsters, slow attacks, making sure to dodge, and midgame bosses are probably the better fights of the game.
Endgame bosses [spoiler] - or boss - i suppose, is attrocious. A cluster**** of a fight consisting of nonstop dodging and RNG reliant platforms used to attack one specific part of the boss. Little skill is required for this as most of the fight is random.[/spoiler]  

Another thing to keep in mind is the amount of pitfalls, spikes, and other assorted deathtraps that seem as if they were designed only to torment the player rather than adding any kind of reasonable platforming challenge. At the very least, I can applaud the game on enemy placement. I cannot think of a single instance in my (currently) sleep deprived brain of mobs that seem to be placed to gank the player. Devs get an ""A"" on that.

All in all, I would get this game if I were a fan of the metroidvania genre and/or a fan of dark fantasy. Also wait until it is on sale like I did. But keep in mind that is is a pretty solid experience up till the end.

The flexibility it has on letting you choose when to throw it out can kinda get you to sometimes just miss the timing. But that's really the only issue.

Exploration is masterfully done thanks to the map being color coded and able to handle markers so if you find something odd, just open the map and throw a marker at a location.

The absolute real winner here is the Audio. Amazing Music coupled with AAA level voice talent and craftmanship. To get the most out of this game, play it in English first, and for the 2nd Playthrough that unlocks the Additional bosses, (can only be done there so, just play it again, trust me), for the love of god play in Spanish Audio and English subs (if you need them) the Spaniard Voice talent is just simply amazing, and the character related to the extra bosses has an absolutely amazing performance.

At 25$ you will get your money's worth in 2 playthroughs easily with all the DLC they've added for free. The kicker is there is incentive for 3 NG+ runs though so 4 runs in total.

I'm the kind of guy who loves FromSoftware games (specially those directed by Miyazaki) but let me tell you: I've never found a ""souls-like"" game that really made me feel like the real thing (not even Ni-Oh, had to force myself through that crap tbh) but then I played Blasphemous and holy shit, it blew my mind.

Blasphemous ain't just some Dark Souls clone. No, sir. It takes some of the most iconic elements of that series and combines them with a game design inspired by Symphony of the Night. It's a bold game that truly understands the metroidvania genre. Unlike many other games this one here doesn't rely on standard mechanics like wall jumping or double jumping INSTEAD it introduces a lot of interesting alternatives that keep the experience fresh even for veterans in this genre.

The game's art is fucking beautiful, the world they've created is some next-level catholic nightmare, the gameplay is immersive and responsive, the exploration is rewarding, the bosses are some of the best designed fuckers I've ever seen... and the animations? The execution animations are the coolest violent shit ever, they NEVER get old. 

All in all Blasphemous is probably the best game I've played that's inspired by Dark Souls/Sekiro/Bloodborne... and I gotta say: it's easily one of the best ""metroidvania"" since Symphony of the Night.

Obviously this is meant for use on a keyboard, but I'm not using a keyboard and using a controller is going to give me a stroke if I try it much longer.  It wouldn't be so bad if the default controls were in the ballpark of the THOUSANDS of other metroidvania games that use the exact same control layout, but nooooo, they needed to make sure that not a single control was the same as the standard layout.

Combat is unforgiving if you press inputs in the wrong order (causing delays in your intended actions, leading to unnecessary knockbacks/damage taken/etc.) but gets into a rhythm after some time. LEARN TO PARRY, it's extremely good (and important).

Combat and traversal aren't even remotely as smooth as in either Super Metroid or Symphony of the Night, which defeats the purpose of aping that style of experience.

Regardless, you will feel compelled to push forward due to the morbid themes, gruesome aesthetics and puzzling lore. Play with Spanish VOs and keep an open mind. 

I have to confess I was going to give this a thumbs down, but the style presented, these bizarre and gory christian motiffs, is rare and unique, which helps a lot.

The game Blasphemous is brilliantly made, and it is well worth the money. The game tackles the concepts of faith, sacrifice, and atonement in a universe that draws inspiration from the Spanish Inquisition.

The game's eye-catching visuals are highlighted by gorgeous hand-drawn animations and intricate backgrounds. The game appears to be a piece of art because of its stunning aesthetics. The soundtrack, with its ominous and atmospheric music that perfectly complements the game, is similarly impressive.

Blasphemous provides a challenging and enjoyable gaming experience. Fast-paced battle calls for ability and planning to beat adversaries. As they advance in the game, the player can unlock a variety of weapons and skills, allowing for several play styles and fighting strategies.

The game's narrative is captivating and contains a rich lore that is discovered through exploration and the finding of undiscovered mysteries. The player is submerged in a sinister and dangerous world full of intrigue and amazing world-building.

Blasphemous's usage of the Spanish Inquisition as a setting for the narrative sets it unique from other games. The game creates a distinctive and unforgettable universe that is both fascinating and horrifying by drawing inspiration from the history of the Inquisition, religious traditions, and mythology of the time.

Blasphemous is, all things considered, a must-play game for fans of difficult action-platformers with a creative flair. The tale is given depth by the usage of Spanish Inquisition themes and legend, and the game's gorgeous visual design produces an unforgettable, immersive experience that you'll remember long after you've finished playing.

Nitroglycerine is an explosive liquid which was first made by Ascanio Sobrero in 1846 by treating glycerol with a mixture of nitric and sulphuric acid. The reaction which follows is highly exothermic, i.e. it generates heat and will result in an explosion of nitroglycerine, unless the mixture is cooled while the reaction is taking place. Liquid nitroglycerine is colorless if pure. It is soluble in alcohols but insoluble in water. Nitroglycerine is extremely sensitive to shock and in the early days, when impure nitroglycerine was used, it was very difficult to predict under which conditions nitroglycerine would explode. Alfred Nobel studied these problems in detail, and was the first to produce nitroglycerine on an industrial scale. His first major invention was a blasting cap (igniter), a wooden plug filled with black gunpowder, which could be detonated by lighting a fuse. This in turn, caused an explosion of the surrounding nitroglycerine.

Alfred Nobel worked hard to improve nitroglycerine as an explosive that could be used in blasting rock and in mining. He made one of his most important discoveries when he found that by mixing nitroglycerine, an oily fluid, with kieselguhr, the mixture could be turned into a paste. This material could be kneaded and shaped into rods suitable for insertion into drilling holes. He called his paste dynamite and went on to develop a blasting cap which could be used to detonate dynamite under controlled conditions.",1679237459,1679237459,True,0,0,0.450819671154022217,0,True,False,False

It deserve an iconic spot alongside Super Metroid and Castlevania in my opinion.

Everything about it is unique. 

-The artstyle and color palets is some of the best out there. 
-The action is quick and reflects oriented. 
-Exploring the maps is easy due to a couple ways of teleporting. 
-100%ing the game is challenging yet possible without guides. Some puzzles are challenging.
-The lore is captivating. 
-Sounds and musics are a great part of the thrill.
-Length of a first playthrough hits the sweet spot.
-Replayability is motivating and engaging. You have a ng+ with the possibility of 3 differents 'handicaps'.
-Enemy variety is huge
-Boss diversity is great and progressively challenging, assuming you encounter them in order. Some bosses are very challenging and will take you 10+ attempts, if not more. 

My only critics is that the majority of spells/items in the game aren't useful compared to others so the lack of versatility is present. More often than not you'll be using the same set up except if you do ng+ with the spells option.

I've noticed a few bugs but nothing that affected my enjoyment of the game play except that my button configuration does not allow me to teleport so I had to reconfigure them every time...

In other word, it's a must play.

Platforming is just terrible - hitboxes of the platforms / walls are actually not where you expect them to be because there is slight ""isometric"" distortion for environments sprites. 
Hitboxes are weird, especially when it comes to wall jumps where you have to hit button to stick to the wall (which is another bad game design decision really for metroidvania) and when the character is in the animation state. 
Controls... are just bad. If the game aims to be relatively precision-based platformer, controls have to satisfy the following 3 rules (they are not set by me of course): 
1. There should not be similar inputs for opposite actions
2. There should not be enforced actions
3. If the game wants to seem fair, it should forgive small mistakes made by player
All 3 of the above rules are broken in Blasphemous, unfortunately

The backgrounds, character designs, story telling, and level visuals are the best I have seen in a long time, and to say that the music is great would be an understatement. 

Unfortunately, the Platforming is extremely inconsistent, buggy, and with the side quest of trying to parkour through these levels, they are absolutely infuriating. Instant death awaits any kind of mistake, and the last one is by far the worst offender. Mixing in fire spamming, and the absolutely horrendous inclusion of the bladed pendulums. Unless if you feel like having the worst time playing this game over and over, play the parkour levels once, and leave it where it belongs, untouched and in the trash.

I rarely ever endorse DLC, but the digital concept artbook (which seems to have many blank pages for some reason), comic, and the soundtrack are great additions and to help these developers make something else that is equally as wonderful as this game.

It reminded me of my first playthrough of the original Dark Souls and that's when everything ""clicked"". I just had to take everything a little bit slower, learn first and act second. And because of that, I really enjoyed my time with Blasphemous (I have beaten all the bosses, got all the achievements, etc.).
The game has that Dark Souls 1 styled reverse difficulty curve, where everything seems awful at first but after you observe and play around a bit, you start to ""know"" and things get pretty easy. For comparison: on my first save file I died about 15 times to one of the first bosses before finally barely beating him with sliver of my health. On my second, ""no healing flasks"" save I beat him first try in about 30 seconds without losing any health. And it's not like my reflexes got better, no, I simply learned what to do. I really liked that.
The thing that stands out even more is the audio/visual side of the game. Simply astonishing. Blasphemous bases a lot of it's influences from Spanish Catholicism, Christianity inspired art and it really shines through, making an unforgettable atmosphere, boosted even more by the moody soundtrack. It might have been the first time I said ""Hey look, it's 'Pietà'!"" while playing a video game. I loved the enemy designs (except the last boss, kinda underwhelming), the backgrounds and the imagery. Pretty unique stuff.
As always, there are some caveats. The platforming... is there. It's not Boshy difficulty but it feels a bit janky at times, especially the wall climb move. The hitboxes suffer sometimes, noticable the most near enemies that shoot thin laser projectiles and when jumping over things. The bosses can rarely overlay their attacks in a way where you just get stun-locked to death, especially when in a corner and that sucked. And my biggest complaint - contact damage and the dodge move. I still don't know why it's in the game (I mean I do but I just think it's unnecessary). I still don't understand the rules for when you're allowed to dodge through enemies. The dodge should either have i-frames or should disable contact damage but for every instance, not just randomly for some enemies.
Those things were a bit frustrating but overall I had an awesome time with the game. The combat feels good, especially after mastering the parry and spell usage. The exploration was enjoyable, the collectibles, the secret rooms, the puzzle rooms, etc. There's a lot to do and see.

Everything is carefully and armonically set to absorb you into this dark and oppressive atmosphere: the music is so good that it never turns repetitive, the visual art is breathtaking and the character design is top notch (plus, some cameos by famous architecture like the Cathedral of Córdoba... which also appears in Berserk, to which Blasphemous also has some loving homages, so double whammy easter egg there). I can't properly describe how every aspect of this game plays together in a symphony of good taste and a very well achieved story. Every piece of lore that you find, every creature you encounter, are just so rich in storytelling that you just want to know more about everything. I also appreciate that the game is challenging and sometimes unforgiving, the game design is great. Plus, as native Spanish speaker, I am super happy that there is a Spanish speaking game in the market, and I'm only writing this review in English so that I can say: English speakers!

I think the art style is the prominent thing in this game. If you like these themes and designs, you’ll probably love it. If not, you may not be into it.

The music is ..eeh. I think there are good tracks, even one of them is among my favourite game soundtracks. But when I think of my whole playthrough (please note that I haven’t played the DLCs) I had a mixed feeling about the music. Sometimes it felt right, sometimes it felt wrong.

So, as I mentioned above, I haven’t played the DLCs, because there was none at my time of playing. But I played after they fixed some movement and controlling clunkyness. It still felt clunky, way clunky than many other side scrollers I’ve played. Especially platforming, which isn’t the main focus of this game. 
Combat was nice I guess.
I liked the world design, and the map was pretty big (though it kinda became a standard for a metroidvania to have a huge world), but the metroidvania aspects had some flaws imo.
First of all, iirc, in very early game, we have an option to go three different ways, directly accessible. But one is way harder than other two, and of course somehow I found myself going there and had some hard times.
Secondly, there wasn’t really any upgrades. I mean for the movement or metroidvania side. It’s been awhile since I played Blasphemous, but I remember that instead of getting upgrades or abilities to access to another place, you got items? instead which helped you getting somewhere you weren’t able to before by adding a perk when equipped, or give an access directly. I’m not exactly sure.
I heard good things about its DLCs, except for Strife & Ruin, I haven’t played them, but it was nice to see Miriam from Bloodstained. The thing is, DLCs came some time after I finished my playthrough in which I got multiple endings(two or three I guess?) and I didn’t really wanted to come back to it for the first DLC. I actually downloaded the game, and started for the DLC, but the clunkyness discouraged me from playing it again. If in my time of playing there were DLCs, then I would probably do all the content I could because I got used to its controls and clunkyness. After not touching it for a while, I didn’t want another shot at it.

Lastly, please don’t make insta death spikes or insta death falls, OR any way of insta death a thing. I don’t like it, I’ll never like it. And in a game which I have mostly concerns of fluidity, please don’t.",1673421860,1677479238,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Pros:
- Great art
- Fantastic Music
- Some of boss fights are good

Cons:
- Slow hit recovery that can leave you getting stunlocked
- Enemies that feel Intentionally annoying instead of challenging
- Levels that are a slog to navigate

My main gripe with the game is that everything in between the bosses feels like something I just have to get through to access the next big fight, and that's not to say the bosses are perfect either but they're still engaging enough to be enjoyed.. It's like the levels of quality in this game are all over the place. It's kind of jarring to go from a boss fight that feels pretty good to something like a hallway full of 5 random enemy types that serve no other purpose than to get in your way or an obstacle course sprinkled with death traps you have to slowly move through, and sometimes you get both of these combined. This is a big deal throughout the game since metroidvanias require a fair bit of backtracking and item collecting, and it's still just as tedious and annoying to go through older areas even after getting more movement options later in the game.

If you want to see how anti-fun this game can be at times just look up what you have to do to get the 7th mea culpa (sword) upgrade, it kinda sums up this game as a whole.

I see people comparing this game to Hollow Knight and if that's the kind of game you're expecting going into this then you're being mislead (as I was). Hollow Knight is charming, has great bosses that feel fair, respects your time, and has levels that are actually enjoyable to traverse and this game doesn't has much to offer that can stack up against that.",1677345713,1677345713,False,6,0,0.491088360548019409,0,True,False,False

what im trying to say is this game IS PURE DOG SHl.T... the upgrades you get are so lame and idiotic and boring with no real noticeable or cool change... you search desperately to find an upgrade (which im very far in the game AND STILL HAVENT FOUND IT) to allow you to move higher or further in the air....

some of the boss fights are overpowered and annoying, there are upgrades that dont even tell you what the f.k the upgrade actually does... there is one that DOES tell you but still leaves you scratching your head on wtf it actually does as nothing changes with your character

there is this one section with a lion who throws axes at you that do 1000000 damage and he takes 100000000000000000000000000000 damage to kill, this entire area is pure bullcr@p overpoweredness, there is a tower that spawns in this joke of a level that throws orbs at you that do 1000000000000000 damage, and from all i've seen the only way to survive this f.king idiotic crap is to glitch the game by sliding into the tower to make you invulnerable and take 0 damage, but then you have to deal with annoying lazers and endless speedster running guys that never f.k off

im literally at the point where i cant even be fed to beat this dog sh.lt game and cant wait to uninstall this joke of a mess... f this game and f the makers of this game who are so dumb they ruined a game with so much potential with dumb cr@p...

You need to be holding straight up (not diagonally) and be right in the middle of the ladder or you'll fall right past it. The grab window in incredibly tight for no reason.

Janky ladders wouldn't normally be a problem if it wasn't for the third rose door challenge having a section with three moving ladders above a spike pit and a fireball launcher shooting at you from offscreen that knocks you off the ladders and into the pit.
You have to jump from ladder to ladder while moving out of the fireballs' way in between the ladder jumps. This would be easy if it wasn't for the half second grab window. 
Almost every death I've had here has been due to the penitent cunt ignoring the ladders and taking a nap in the spike pit because i held diagonally up to get closer to the ladder and grab it at the same time instead of forward then straight up once I was withing its very small grabbing range.

QoL unbeknownst to the player-

 After spending 30 hours getting every upgrade I could and every collectible possible I was left in distaste after realizing I was locked out of 100% my first playthrough because I missed certain npcs. For a game that focuses so heavily on its secrets and making them incredibly hard to this degree the #1 rule I would assume is to make every secret accessible no matter what point in the game you are. I was also expecting to be able to find the dlc by myself but had to look it up and realized I needed to be in ng+. Their choice of stripping you of your most important upgrades when you go into ng+ is brutal and not in a good way. You can probably understand some of my hate here. I get this far into the game and now have to replay everything just for the dlc? All of the upgrades I had just gotten destroyed and I'm told to get them all again? Clearly these devs take inspiration from other games in the genre so why did they make some parts so insufferable? There is literally a shovel knight easter egg in this game and it's comical because shovel knight does so many more things right. The art of this game is so charming, the boss design is fantastic, the world is incredible, yet they make such crippling design choices that almost ruined it for me personally. Everything around and about the secrets in this game are just yuck. You have to be like god damn Indiana Jones to figure out some of these secrets. ""Oh sorry you didn't hear that the ground in this tiny square was slightly louder? Guess you will be missing out on something important"" I wish I was joking about this. Most of the secrets in this game require some other relic (like key basically) in order to actually get to and funnily enough the way you get these ""relics"" is through very easily missed npcs/secrets. In my playthrough I hadn't even unlocked these relics that let me access so many important secrets till I was nearing the final boss. Again, I wish I was joking. It's really sad given the potential this game had but the secrets just KILLED it for me. Being told to enter the dlc and reset most of my progress was basically the nail in the coffin for me. This game has honestly taken too much of my energy towards and I don't care enough to critique it any longer.

774361,133251790,76561199157887772,0,5,5788,0,5788,1676915976,"A beautiful and ruthless adventure in a world dominated by a distorted religion.

Blasphemous's most vital characteristic is its pixel art, which blends gothic art and the brutal style of the game. The scenes, although simple, are captivating. They are beautiful and often frightening, showing entities with a macabre appearance and other mysterious creatures whose appearance can be uncomfortable. Spanish culture inspires blasphemous's settings, the Middle Ages and Catholicism, represented by locations, enemies, symbols and more. These elements create a disconcerting but exciting universe.

""For twisted are, were, and will be, the paths of the miracle."" 

The world is fascinating to explore, with its stone cathedrals, its leprosy-stricken village and its lost mountain-top convent. The artist's gory and morbid imagery considers violent Catholic iconography and Dolorism, a doctrine that exhorts to ""suffer to atone for one's sins.""
Just like waking hallucinations, some moments are so striking and unique; they're almost enough to motivate the continuation of your journey, to see what crazy visions are in store for you next.

""Make my chest hurt with regret. Forge your punishment and nail it deep."" 

The level design is well-developed, with several shortcuts and secret passages. Something that might be a bother is the platforming sections, which often become tedious and frustrating because of instant-death thorns or bottomless abysses, forcing you back to the latest save point and requiring a lot of back-and-forth travel; it gets tiring after a while. Most of the time, exploration is a well-balanced challenge. The distance from save points forces you to progress step by step, concentrating on each confrontation to avoid fatal errors. From these moments comes a sense of achievement commensurate with the effort made and great satisfaction at opening shortcuts, which are plentiful throughout the levels; these mark coherent design thought as whole and intelligently connected parts; the game knows how to change things up by alternating between vertical rooms that focus on combat and horizontal areas more conducive to platforming. Exploration is an absolute pleasure in most of the game.

""Go fearlessly, Penitent One."" 

As for combat, it is functional. Its action palette remains simple and is in its entirety from the start (only a few special moves remain to be unlocked). Besides a simple sword strike, you can parry (in the right tempo), dodge and jump over inevitable blows. Giving three responses to opposing attacks to each enemy corresponds to an ideal response, which will be learned through experience. However, some bosses' battles offer natural resistance and can only be defeated by learning their attack patterns. 

The game's combat and exploration mechanics are simple in their execution. It is complex regarding its inventory system - with several options that affect gameplay. An excellent example is the passive skill items that can be gained, called Rosary Beads. Some objects protect against poisoning, and things that allow them to deal more damage or gain energy by breaking items in the scenario. There are also Relics, which grant the ability to see hidden platforms and hear voices from specific statues; Prayers are spells within this game; Hearts of Mea culpa add buffs to the sword through items found during our journey; Quest Items are abundant because of the several side quests available throughout the game; finally, there are Key Items which serve specific purposes like opening doors or unlocking treasure chests.

 ""Sorrowful be the heart, Penitent One, full of clemency.""

Death is inevitable, but luckily the penalty is forgiving. Your Fervour bar, which is used for special techniques, will become capped more and more with each death. You will also receive a penalty to gain Tears (In-game currency). This can be undone by returning to the place of death or visiting a particular location.",1676922043,1676922043,True,34,0,0.769885540008544922,0,True,False,False

You can actually miss content if you don't talk to NPCs before you've defeated specific Bosses.

I enjoyed the atmosphere with the religious symbols & spanish aesthetics. By the way, the spanish voice acting was incredible. It totally fits the game and was high quality.

I liked how threatening some Bosses were with their design, music and sound effects.
I recall Bosses like Our Lady of the Charred Visage and Exposito. Some NPCs were also really striking, I especially remember the dude with an old man coming out of his belly, and the siamese sisters.

Gameplay-wise, my favorite Boss fights are:
- Our lady of the Charred Visage: It was the first Boss that made me struggle a lot. The second phase where he throws fire balls with both hands really made me sweat! Challenging & fun fight
- Quirce: The boss wasn't hard, but his patterns were just really engaging
- Crisanta: This fight relied heavyly on parrying, which I always love in Metroidvanias
- Isidora: Hardest boss in the game, and it also relies a lot on parrying. Hearing her chants during the fight was dope, and she has a cool design.

The exploration wasn't that fun and I barely remember any area theme. It's the third Metroidvania that I play, and I realize that I enjoy combat a lot more than platforming.
While I was playing Blasphemous, I was always looking forward to the next Boss fight, but I was often losing my patience during the exploration between each Boss. And the same can be said about Grime,
which I played a few months ago.

Just a nitpick, but some hitboxes were a bit clunky. There were weird ladders & spikes hitboxes in Miriam's platforming challenges.

It is worth mentioning that the game has a very low graphic requirement and that you will hardly have problems in this regard.",1665676349,1676645645,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
774361,133033508,76561198029011512,1460,55,962,0,962,1676638313,"Blasphemous is not a Souls-like despite popular belief, it's a Metroidvania through and through. And it's another one of those games I really wanted to love, but I just can't. It's a game with a really gorgeous aesthetic, with so much love and talent poured into its world and art, but I feel the gameplay falls so incredibly short compared to its surface elements that I honestly don't understand how the game itself got so much praise.

It's not all bad though, because when it's at its best it can be a ton of fun and most of the bosses are incredibly creative and really fun to fight that I didn't mind attempting them over and over again. But its issues permeate the entire experience  and thus severely hurts the game for me to the point I can confidently say I don't like Blasphemous very much. As usual I break things down:

Pros:
- Incredible artwork with a gorgeous dark fantasy aesthetic
- Excellent music, which really adds to the atmosphere
- Fantastic boss fights that all felt unique with interesting quirks and methods to beat them
- Highly explorable world, with tons of branching paths and secrets to discover and shortcuts going back to previous areas
- Interesting magic system. with a unique way of gaining more magic by damaging yourself
- Lore seems quite interesting and very in-depth
- Parry mechanic has a ton of usage compared to most other games
- A wealth of content, being reasonably lengthy with extra modes, difficulties and secret activities to find
- Sliding stab attack is pretty damn great

Cons:
- Combat is extremely basic and anaemic and takes a bit too long to get the interesting abilities
- Unresponsive controls where my inputs were actively ignored, especially in combat when I want to slash upwards but Penitent One continues to attack horizontally, or sometimes he doesn't jump when I clearly pressed jump
- Enemies can have attacks that are insanely difficult to avoid and have absurd damage outputs, made even worse when you have extremely limited healing compared to most games
- Terrible hitboxes; there have been many times where I was clearly out of range of many melee attacks but somehow I still  get caught and suffer huge damage
- Contact damage; in a game where you're learning attack patterns, dodging past enemies and trying to exploit their openings, this mechanic is incredibly dumb, runs counter to flow of combat and feels needlessly cheap, especially when the contact damage hitbox lingers after certain enemies and bosses teleport away
- The vast majority of even the most basic enemies will never stagger from your attacks even with your most powerful attacks, yet you're staggered and thrown off of ledges with every single attack which again feels dumb and cheap
- Not enough opportunities to use special attacks and combos that you unlock, with enemies having countermeasures against them or by simply being a bad idea to use as they open you up to damage and knockback
- Certain enemies have combos that are timed perfectly to hit you after getting knocked down, meaning you'll suffer multiple hits and unable to dodge away - this is especially prevalent with bosses that use lightning attacks
- A certain section of a game has you getting locked in arenas to deal with enemies, however one enemy type regularly bugs out and stops you from killing it, meaning you have to reset the game to continue and hope it doesn't bug out again
- Platforming can feel very wonky and inconsistent, sometimes you jump up to a platform high enough to clearly land on it but you just fall right through, and sometimes Penitent One will grab onto a ledge and sometimes he won't
- Certain ranged enemies and traps are deliberately placed to knock you off ledges and into instant death spikes, which itself isn't a problem but Blasphemous overuses this trope in many areas and is just irritating
- Teleporters are rather poorly placed, sometimes you go through huge swathes of the world map without a single teleporter to previous areas, while other parts of the map have two teleporters very close together

So yeah Blasphemous has some really great moments but it's so bogged down by all of the issues I've mentioned, so much so to the point that I can comfortably say that it just isn't a very good game at all. I cannot fathom why people love it so much unless they're a glutton for punishment, which is fitting for the themes of the game, I guess? So maybe it's doing something right.

It's a real shame because it has everything it needs to be a great game, fantastic even, maybe a full on indie classic. But I can't ignore the incredibly sloppy execution and terrible inconsistencies that actively plague the entire game from start to finish. So many issues that I am amazed that so many people either completely ignore or have just forgotten even exist. I'm one of those people who thinks ""Surely a game this beloved must be loved for a reason and I just don't get it"", but after beating the game my scepticism was proven true and I think it's just overhyped fluff and a great big disappointment. There are Metroidvanias out there that are so much better and far more considered than Blasphemous. Not to knock the developers as they clearly poured a lot of love into it but sadly that effort didn't translate into a fun game, I wish them all the best on their next project though.

If you're looking for a similar game to Blasphemous and want to support Team 17 then pick up Thymesia instead, that game has some absolutely stellar combat with very interesting and unique mechanics, and is just a much better use of your time.",1676643680,1676645094,False,32,1,0.613497018814086914,0,True,False,False

Wish I could get a refund, even at $6 it's a steep rental for a few hours of playing to realize this game isn't for me.

Edit: After putting in 50 hours to beat it to near 100%, I still don't recommend this game to anyone except to fans of 2d games that like moderately challenging platforming/combat. This is probably the most unbalanced game I've ever played. For 4/5ths of the game, you barely get any upgrades, so you're weak for most of the game. All of a sudden you get 3 sword upgrades at the very end of the game, when it's practically useless, and then you are over powered except for 1 cheap boss that spams attacks and for the cheap DLC.

[b]Biggest draw:[/b]
The main interest for me was the visuals and lore. 
The dark fantasy elements easily kept my attention. Exploring is my main interest in games like these. It's gorgeous to look at. I loved the way everything was designed, especially the characters and bosses. Visually I think it brought a lot of fun to the table and not once did I think the designs in this game were ""trying too hard"" or being disingenuous. I personally wasn't crazy about most of the skins, but I appreciate the playful nostalgia they have.
To me the world feels small but very alive and VERY worth the exploration! The dialogue is pretty heavy handed with its wide vocabulary, which made it hard for me to keep up with sometimes, but still kept me interested and wondering about the in's and out's of the world!

I only wish there were more cutscenes!


[b]Biggest gripes:[/b]
[list]
    [*]The backtracking was rough and made game progression feel like a chore at times. And what's worse is that the backtracking and grinding in this game just doesn't mesh very well. I like grinding in games, but when it comes to making expensive purchases (items, upgrades, etc.) the amount of work put in doesn't seem worth what you'll get in return. However, I found that for the most part if you play smart, you shouldn't have to grind too much.
    [*]Miriam's challenges overall felt really out of place and took away some of the game's magic for me. I know she is from another game but she just does not fit with the game's aesthetics nor the game's lore in general. The difficulty and reward (and lack of lantern jump explanation) in this DLC made it the most infuriating part of the entire game. I gotta say I've never felt like I wasted time playing a video game before... until I ran into this DLC. If its your first time playing I would completely skip past Miriam's challenges.
    [*][i]IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE LANTERN JUMPS THEN PLEASE EXPLAIN LANTERN JUMPS IN THE TIPS SECTION!!![/i] I spent hours doing them wrong and it caused a tremendous amount of grief when it came to Miriam's challenges. This is an issue many other players have had!

[b] Pros+ [/b] 
+Challenging but fair combat.
+Incredible pixel art graphics.
+Beautiful animations.
+Aesthetically unique and original.
+Interesting spells.
+Doesn't lose currency upon death, instead lose some use of fervour bar (magic).
+Huge map to explore.
+Parrying mechanic that feels like it works.

[b] Cons- [/b] 
-The lack of item/collectable tracking on the map.
(Simple fix = copy Metroid - place a small dot on the map where items have already been gathered.)
-Inconsistent mechanic for using lamps to jump, sometimes works as expected often does not.
-Some bugs: e.g. enemy killed then take a repeated damage animation from an invisible enemy until you leave the room.
-Guilt dropped on spikes unable to retrieve.
- dlc messes up pacing quite a bit.
-Being unable to equip all traversal abilities at once. Limited to 3 and have to keep switching between via menus.
-Major traversal items are gained through ridiculously convoluted means: talk to x npc then give item, then return to room then go to y npc then  go half way across the map inside fountain talk to z npc.
(Instead of a specific boss drop it was like the devs played dark souls and said, ""Oh, you think you're cryptic and confusing? Hold my beer."")
-Cryptic.

Games like Blasphemous, Hollow Knight, Olija, etc. make me enjoy the souls-like genre more, and I think that has to do with the fact that they have fun, simple movement abilities and attacks blended seamlessly into the metroidvania backbone that it makes them simultaneously frustrating but so dripping with incredible art and details that it keeps me playing for hours at a time. Where Elden Ring felt overwhelmingly long and unnecessarily difficult in even the tamest of areas (hence feeling like a waste of time and, funnily enough, feels like it has more empty space than the anti BoTW people would have you believe) Blasphemous has another secret area with some neat little trinket that has noteworthy impact in the way you play the game.

 I really enjoyed the art, atmosphere, soundtracks and boss fights, I am not really fan of platformer games, so platforming section were a bit annoyance but not enough to quit the game. I also didn't have much trouble navigating through most of the game, and didn't had to look up online how to clear this area, and that for finishing the game(Not 100%).

The first thing that will likely draw you to Blasphemous is its macabre aesthetics that will transport you into this nightmarish land where suffering is the status quo. The boss and enemy design is one of the most intricate and interesting I've seen in a long time. Yes, the inspiration is mostly taken from catholic iconography but this game takes that further and molds it into grotesque pitiable creatures. The OST also deserves praise because it perfectly complements the game but it's great on its own as well. There's no cheesy epic choir boss fights with faux latin lyrics. Every track fits the area and the boss, every track is distinct like the acoustic and electric spanish guitars, the flowing piano arpeggios, the unsettling ambient parts, the playful flamenco all of it suits the story it's trying to tell. 

Gameplay-wise you've got your sword and your prayers. Prayers are basically your magical abilities and with your sword you have a decent number of moves considering the 2D medium. You can also improve your character build with rosary beads and mea culpa hearts which you'll find scattered throughout your journey and also relics which will be crucial to traversing some areas and spots. Parrying and dodging are extremely important to master and my favorite out of the combat are the execution animations. They're so well done. So there's a decent amount of gameplay mechanics to customize your playstyle and I would suggest playing with them because they do make a difference. The locations are also diverse and there's a certain charm in navigating those labyrinthine areas although the platforming can get frustrating at times. There's going to be a small number of puzzles to solve and taking hints from your environment and reading descriptions is a good habit to have.

As for its story, you get fed bits and pieces of the lore in a souls style through sparse enigmatic dialogues, item description and visual storytelling. And while the game obviously derives inspiration from dark souls the game is entirely its own thing but those who enjoy souls (like) games will probably enjoy Blasphemous too.

All in all, this is now one of my favorite games even though I haven't played metroidvanias that much before. I'm greatly looking forward to Blasphemous 2 one of my most anticipated games at the moment.",1675727863,1675728126,True,10,0,0.644091665744781494,0,True,False,False

The score/music is off the charts amazing. The setting is bizarre and surreal, and of course dark and twisted. It's like playing a 2D pixelated nightmare. I recommend using a controller, but if you're a keyboard god then get after it. Exploration combined with the music is a 10/10 experience. I don't want to get more specific because I think it's better if experienced without knowing specifics. Boss fights are all pretty memorable with a few being great and one being absolutely pulse pounding epic. Story isn't treading any new ground, but it's well done and again it's weird. Weird is a compliment here in case that isn't clear. 

Every artistic element in Blasphemous is incredibly well done. Needed a bit more boobs but everything does so that's not a real complaint or critique, just a half-joke cause I'm also half serious lol. Conversely, the combat isn't the best, but Blasphemous does everything else so intensely well that it doesn't matter. The combat is good enough. A game with combat can't be good if the combat is bad, and the combat is definitely not bad. It's just not the game's strongest part. I did the fist pump f yeah thing when I got it right, so it's still very satisfying to defeat whatever it is you need to defeat throughout the game. On the other hand, I did love the platforming.

the most grievous one is....

...claiming that it's a Metroidvania.

I'd flog and Y-button whoever thought to put that tag up there....

It's a 2D Souls game (and a beautiful one), that's it. 

Your mobility doesn't change all game long (no, portals don't count) and backtracking is painful..also because...
Upgrades are very boring (make invisible platforms appear); items increase your strength only marginally; even at the end of the game you don't feel particularly powerful or different than in the beginning;  you still need to stay careful around enemies and they will keep slowing you down; the game speed never picks up, even for the most basic enemy from the beginning your pimped out pope-slapping buffed up endgame main will still need to wait for the attack animation...parry..counter...move on..

Item management sucks - some upgrades can only be changed at check points, but virtually all items feel so marginal/not powerful at all, that it feels random, how you can change some anytime you want and others only at save points. The truly game relevant items, that open new pathways eg., shouldn't be optionally equippable by the way..you have three 'special' slots for them, there's more than three in the game...and you can switch them in and out anytime. Why? What's the point? Just keep them activated all the time.

Now having played (and finished) a so-called 'souls-like Metroidvania' I'm convinced that these formulas don't match. The fun of getting ever crazier mobility, speed and combat ability runs counter to a souls game, which is supposed to remain challenging all the time and where you're supposed to play slowly and carefully.

Minor complaints: 
[list]
    [*]The religious/Christian/inquisition theme I wasn't a big fan of...but it gives license for the devs to come up with some crazy boss art. 
    [*]As much as I love pixelart, the pixelated interface/lore text was rather annoying and hard to read, I think it's fine to keep text ...you know..HD..readable..
    [*]Just like Souls games, even though Hollow Knight is guilty of this as well, the story seems to be an afterthought, or something that you need to piece together by finding items to read the lore...I'd prefer it when the story unfolds as you play it. One of the better/exciting parts of the game, was [spoiler] in the beginning, when you were followed by the red dude and there seemed to be multiple 'actors' involved in the story, After you kill him and his sister, you feel pretty much alone again in the world.[/spoiler]   
[/list]

So..I actually wouldn't recommend the game for a pure Metroidvania fan, in that regard the game is truly disappointing...but if you're just looking for a beautiful challenging 2D platformer with an open world, a crazy Christian theme and some gore, go ahead. The [spoiler]giant snake[/spoiler] fight alone is worth the money.",1674957650,1674957851,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Jump momentum is static the entire game regardless of if you dash into it

Exploration is damn fun and they do a good job connecting places back to each other in a similar way that the souls games do the ""door does not open from this side"" kind of deal. Visually the game looks really good and there is also a ton of detail in the animations. They even have a specific execution animation for each of the enemy types for which there are a pretty large amount of which is always fun to see when you try it on a new enemy. Music is also pretty solid and really adds to the fun of exploring the game. Ok, now the negatives. One major downside that nearly made me drop this game was the bosses which throughout most of the game, are pretty damn lame. Out of the ones I've fought (which I think is nearly all of them except for some endgame ones) the most enjoyable was probably Isidora, but other than that and maybe the big snake boss thing they all lack a wide move set and are just pretty boring. I think there are other endgame bosses which are probably pretty good based on Isidora being a fun and challenging boss, but I think I'd need to do an entire other play through to get to them cause I think I locked myself out of it. Speaking of which, there are a couple of endings to this game and they require the player to perform specific actions before others so if you do something like kill a boss you find without knowing that you were supposed to do something else beforehand you just lock yourself out of more content which is pretty annoying. Another thing which I found somewhat frustrating was the spikes would insta kill you, I know its a soulslike and all and its supposed to be unforgiving but I've had too many scenarios where I don't remember a room layout exactly and just fall into spikes that I couldn't see previously. Overall the game was still enjoyable for the most part. There are fun puzzles sometimes and the context clues they give are just enough to help you figure it all out. However, sometimes the quests are not so easy to figure out and I won't lie, I had to look some stuff up cause I was too damn confused. I don't think I will be getting all of the achievements for this game but if you really enjoy it then it looks like there is a good amount of content to get through. 7/10",1674794596,1674794596,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[*] Climate and setting.
This game has an amazing atmosphere. You really feel immersed in the world. Each location is very distinctive, with its own feel.

[*] Intricate story that you need a video explanation for to truly appreciate.
The story of Cvstodia and The Miracle is a simple, yet very effective one. Most questions are answered, but others aren't. Blasphemous really succeeds in making you want more of it. The worldbuilding is great, giving you tidbits of lore about everything, the only downside being that most of it is through text that you might not want to read through.

[*] The animation and OST
The art direction in the game is amazing. It gives out a retro vibe, while being mostly fluid and is very detailed. Character designs are very memorable and leave a lasting impresssion. The soundtrack only accents it, keeping you immersed through the whole playthrough. 

[*] The exploration
It pulls of the main appeal of metroidvanias really well. Exploring leads to rewards, as well as lore about the world. The map is very accessible, allowing you to mark locations from the start, which helps if you get a movement item later than you should.

[*] The combat.
Don't get me wrong, the combat in this game can be rewarding, but sometimes it can be frustrating. If you're looking for Hollow Knight depth of combat, you're in the wrong place. It's possible for bosses to feel underwhelming or a bit unfair, and the flow is easily disrupted.

[*] The relics/movement items.
You can only equip 3 of them at a time, but you can change them anytime, so... what's the point? They're quite unique for your average metroidvania, and so is the way of getting them. It's usually not so obvious, meaning you might miss out on them and play half the game without a movement item, which might get a bit annoying. It ties well into the next point, being...

[*] The difficulty.
I'm not the one to complain about difficulty, but some might be turned away, especially since it isn't just the combat that is hard. Finding secrets, even the ones relevant to the story, is hard. It's not obvious what you have to do to progress through the story. This includes unlocking different endings. You work for them through the whole game, unknowingly. You will very likely [spoiler]get the worst ending[/spoiler] the first time you play.
[/list]
[h2]The bad[/h2]
[list]
[*]Some design decisions
It's possible for ingame sidequests to break, rendering you unable to complete them. If you hunt for achievements, this will be annoying. You also get locked out of alternate endings upon finishing a playthrough or if you kill a boss too early. One such occurence is the inability to complete an alternate ending sidequest after fighting a boss, but it's so vague that you might think it's a bug. The NPC will straight up refuse to talk to you for no reason, making you start a new save, if you want to attempt it again.

[*]The movement, or rather, one of the (free) DLCs.
The movement's clunky. Most of the time it won't matter, but a DLC added parkour sections to the game. They range from mediocre to atrocious. What's the point of a timed trial if there are cycles in it? Couldn't you just replace them with actual obstacles? It gets to a point where sometimes skipping a part will not start the further part of the course, meaning you have to wait for the game to catch up, standing in one place. And getting hit on a ladder will send you into freefall, most likely into a pit of spikes, but not if you are jumping? The movement system could've really used some polish.

The first 20 minutes was okay. Then the platforming and constant walking became annoying (why is there no fast travel if the map is huge?!). Near the end of my gameplay it felt like a chore. I really disliked the combat as it felt less like ""git gud"" and more like ""let's throw several enemies at you in small spaces while you try to not die from falling or spikes"". I couldn't lower the difficulty so I just had to repeat several areas over and over again...while accruing guilt which is a punishment system set in place for dying too often. Why am I being punished for dying? That's so stupid.

Apparently the beginning is super difficult while the end-game is a joke but I'm too fed up with the game and don't think I'll return to finish it. It's a shame too because the visuals and story seemed interesting enough. Gameplay always comes before story and art for me though.

EDIT (original was 2h at playtime)

So I was bored and had nothing else to play so I ended up continuing. The game does (mostly) get easier with the final bosses being a joke. Thing is, I didn't feel powerful because all of that stuff is offset by insta-death from spikes and (if you don't have an item equipped) falling into pits. That's such a dumb mechanic imo. I can kill huge bosses, obliterate several enemies at once, even get incinerated and still come out okay, but a single touch from a spike and I'm straight up dead. This becomes even more annoying when you start doing time challenges as they are always filled with spikes. There aren't really check points so you end up being teleported back to the beginning of the time challenge. This can get extremely annoying when the challenges can be a few minutes long, meaning you have to repeat certain sections over and over again.

Which leads to the next issue, bugs. The game is generally pretty good at not being buggy but sometimes you can get glitched which requires a reload. This becomes especially apparent if you become frustrated enough with the time challenges that you enable invincibility (not gonna go into detail how to do this). I get that the game wasn't designed for invincibility in mind...I also don't think there should ever be a situation where dying would revive you in a pit of spikes, forcing a reload. Seems pretty simple to me to code a condition where dying teleports you to the last-visited prayer dieu or the beginning of the time challenge/checkpoint (I was fed up enough that I enabled invincibility for almost all of the time challenges so I don't know if the check points are intrinsic).

What can be incredibly frustrating is that this is supposed to be a platformer game yet you have to be very precise to grab the edge of a platform. It ruins the immersion when I'm playing with a controller and I slightly overshot the ledge. There should be some wiggle room, I don't think being overly precise was a good design decision. If the main focus was platforming then I guess I could sort of understand it, yet this is also a souls-like game so I don't know what's up. Even more annoying however are the possible stunlocks that can arise with no ability to escape once started. At least certain souls-like games have a poise stat, instead you can get hit by swinging axes that drop you into a pit of spikes with no hope of aerial recovery, or get hit by certain enemies that do follow-ups and take off a chunk of health, get mobbed to death if you're unlucky, etc.

Fast travel does become an option after a certain point, it doesn't seem like a good idea to put that mechanic behind a wall of progress though. First you have to deal with zero fast travel for a while, then you get access to a limited fast travel option that requires you to be in certain areas, then you need to pay a good chunk of money to access a new fast travel option (20k total which is a lot in the beginning) which is more accessible than the first but requires you to be at a shrine, and FINALLY you can stumble upon a prayer that teleports you to the last-visited shrine. Unfortunately this can make it annoying to reach your desired location since the method is 1) equip the prayer, 2) activate the prayer, 3) rest at the shrine, and 4) fast travel to your shrine of choice (with probably unequipping the prayer). The time wasted adds up if you fast travel a lot which you probably will at some point. Keep in mind that you can only reach this point after you've invested several hours into the game. QoL would be vastly improved if this was just implemented from the very beginning of the game, I don't see the value otherwise as it feels the game doesn't respect my time.

I have some other issues with the game but those were my main ones. I still think the art is great and the lore is genuinely interesting. I also appreciate the narrative direction to scatter the story among items, dialogue, and npc quests as it creates an incentive to read stuff over, increasing immersion. This was the main reason why I kept playing even though everything else started to feel like a chore to me. I'm probably going to watch a youtube video or two that goes over the different endings and lore since I don't have it in me to start ng+ in order to find out all the details of the in-game universe.

Overall I think the game mechanics are frustrating and unfair while the game's saving grace is its art and story, soundtrack wasn't bad either.

1. This is mainly a metroidvania, you won't see super cool combos, also you don't loose your currency by dying and the combat is significantly slower to Hollow Knight or Dark Souls
2. Exploration can be deadly and have you dying on the same spot several times, make it a habit to run past enemies if beating them all doesn't seem worth it. 
3. There's no hand holding, the story is non linear, the combat doesn't scale, you will reach areas where they will body you alive, also items do a poor job explaining what the hell they do (excellent lore though)

I believe I enjoyed to game overall, but my feelings are carried mostly by the game's atmosphere, characters, story, and art style. The core game play constantly annoyed and bored me. I enjoyed the game the most when exploring new areas. The areas and scenery are amazing. The story is interesting to follow, although I found myself getting bored near the end with constant backtracking. Metroidvania's are supposed to excel with backtracking, but this game makes it feel like a chore. You will run all the way to the beginning of the game, just to open a door and have a single platform section while your expectations were much higher. The enemies are very well designed, but some become annoying walls that force you to stop and fight each time you want to pass. However my biggest gripe is with the bosses. I have played my share of souls-like games and I understand the importance of the bosses.  The bosses in this game are amazing visually, but the fight itself is very unsatisfying. You are basically fighting meat bags that  take hit after hit while you only have a few choices of attacks. Most of the late game bosses turn into hit-and-run strategies. You get very small opening of attacks and they punish you for going for a full combo. When it comes to the final hit that kills the boss, I felt more satisfied that it was over rather than satisfied that I killed a ""hard boss."" The worst thing about this was how contrast the final boss was to the rest. It was a literal pushover. After I fought it, I was staring at the screen saying ""that's it?"" The true ending at least adds on to the fight, but it only helps so much.

[h1]Story[/h1]
The story is set in a deeply religious world known as [b]Cvstodia[/b], a recent event known as the [b]Miracle[/b] that manifested itself to those who were pious or sinful. All the pain that a soul has is tangible with everyone everywhere, it could be a form of blessing for some, for others, a punishment. With a divine and unfathomable will, all a person can do is make penance.

Does the story for [b]Blasphemous[/b] make sense? No, did I explain it in any way that would make sense? No, will you enjoy the story anyway without really knowing anything? Yes. It’s a bit of an interesting take, as you won’t know what the story is even telling you, yet you may like it for its mystery in what the game may throw at you next. There isn’t really a whole lot to say about the story, so I’ll have to just leave it at that for the most part.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
[b]Blasphemous[/b] has some really fun combat that I for the most part enjoyed very much, there are a wide variety of enemies to fight throughout the game. You can block and parry enemy attacks to stun them and then attack, sometimes you may even be able to perform an execution move on rare occasions. There are also a few upgrades for you to get and they have a variety of uses for you in combat or in movement. Some abilities you get allow you to access other areas in the game that you may have not been able to get to previously. It adds a reason to go back and get certain things if you strive to get 100% completion. They all have their own unique uses and I like how the game has a bunch of different options for you to try out. You can only equip a few abilities at a time, so make sure to try out different things to get the best benefits.

There is also a skill tree that will allow you to get permanent upgrades, like increasing your combo, or giving you access to different attacks for you to use. There isn’t a whole lot of stuff you can get but there may be something in the skill tree that catches your interest.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2918925804
The boss fights are really fun to challenge and can be gruesome at times, they can be a bit hard to fight and that’s what makes a boss a boss. They had their own attack patterns and ways to beat them. There are also a ton of secrets for you to go out and find, like extra flask bottles, getting extra health, or other power-ups that can aid your journey.

Now despite me saying good things about [b]Blasphemous’s[/b] gameplay, I have a ton of issues with it. [b]Blasphemous[/b] says that it’s a hard game but despite it just throwing the worst aspects of a 2D platformer at you, this game is surprisingly easy. Now, the difficulty is subjective to each person, but I have experience with these types of games. The platforming in this game has to be one of the biggest issues, yes you read that right, a platformer has issues with its platforming. When it comes to wall climbing, I will press the button at the right moment, for it to not register and I end up falling to my death. It starts to be more of a problem when enemies who fire projectiles come into play as well. Climbing ladders have an issue as well because when it comes to jumping from one ladder to the next it may not register either. This too has led to me dying a few times as well and it really starts to get annoying when I keep dying from things beyond my control.

Some of the upgrades I got from the skill tree I never used once, there is one where you can turn your blood into a projectile to help take out enemies, but I never used it. There is also one where you can use it to strike your enemies when going down in mid-air, which I only used for one secret. The only skill tree upgrades that I actually found useful, were the ones that increased the combo that I could pull off since that actually had an impact on enemies and bosses. There are also ones that you may find scattered throughout the game and even those ones may feel useless too.

Then there is an issue with the backtracking. Now, backtracking in [b]Mertiodvenias[/b] is common but [b]Blasphemous’s[/b] method of doing it is an issue - here, I’ll talk about an example. So, at some point in the game, you will need to get your hands on the [b]Key of the Inquisitor[/b] from the [b]Sleeping Canvases[/b], to get access to the [b]Jaw of Ashgan[/b]. To get this key, you need to buy it from this shop with 9999 of the game’s currency. These shops are not marked on the map, [b]Candelaria[/b], the shopkeeper does have multiple shops in the game but sells different things in each shop. So, you have to get it from that one area, these two areas I mentioned, aren’t really connected to each other so you have to go through other areas as well. 

On top of that, there isn’t really a way to fast-travel, except through these mirrors that are scattered throughout the game, or this one special move that will bring you back to your last spawn point. Suffice to say, that’s quite a tall order to get to that one area.

However, that’s not all either, as I have issues with the bosses. I did say they are challenging but some of them are actually quite easy. You may die a few times, but all you have to do is memorize the attack patterns and you have beaten the boss. Enemy placement is also an issue, sometimes, this is more of a minor issue but when it does come up, it’s an issue. Some enemies are obstacles that you can’t hit but have to avoid and let me tell you, avoiding some of them is not easy. Sliding away from enemies also sometimes does not work, there are some where you can slide but with big boss enemies, you can’t and are forced to fight them.

I also came across a point where an enemy got stuck on a platform and I had to restart from my last checkpoint.

[h1]Graphics and Performance[/h1]
[b]Blasphemous[/b] is very beautiful in a disturbing way, I love how the pixel art style was done and it made the game have a somewhat creepy feel to it with some of the enemies. The game should be able to be run on low-end PCs without issue. I tested the game on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB, AMD Ryzen 5 1500X Quad-Core Processor 3.50, and 16 GB of RAM. I should also give a small mention of the soundtrack, as I enjoyed that as well.

[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]
Now, despite all of my complaints with [b]Blasphemous[/b], I still had a fun time playing it and I think that’s the most important part of the game. For some, it may be a challenge but for others, it won’t be as hard as some people make it out to be. However, there is still enjoyment to be found and I think it’s a good game, nonetheless, although I’d maybe wait for a sale before buying.

-Game relies heavily on platforming for its challenge yet the controls and platforming detection isn't very tight

-Most of the mobs you fight aren't all that difficult to deal with outside of a few exceptions and usually as i mentioned above, it relies mainly on putting bad platforming around to make enemies a challenge.

-Boss fight vary from too easy to being kinda broken and poorly done, some bosses re-use animations for different kinds of attacks with very minor differences making it annoying to guess if this is the variant of the attack you can parry or if it's the one you're suppose to jump over/dodge through, so sometimes with some fights it just boils down to dying a couple of times trying to spot the minute differences as to what to parry, what to dodge and what to jump over. 

-Speaking of dodging, it's also a trial by error to figure out often at which animation intervals you can dodge through some enemies or their attacks. Some are obvious, yet some leave you confused as to why you couldn't dodge through it.

-Combat is not really satisfying, something is missing from it, it just feels very bland and average to play. Maybe cause there's not enough interesting moves or the fact you're locked to just one weapon and all you got mainly is just some trinkets to add some % modifiers, there are spells to find but they have limited uses and aren't all that earth shattering.

I wanted to like it, i love Souls games and i like Metroidvanias but this just didn't do it.

I like the graphics and the presentation, but Blasphemous is straight up just an infuriating or eye-rolling chore most of the time as the 'gotcha!' moments and enemies pour forth in abundance. Which is the point, and I should have taken that point from the demo, which fairly presented these gameplay factors.

Got far enough in to say its just not for me. Everything is subjective and you can't please everyone.
This game to me felt more like work than fun, nothing felt rewarding. Most of the time I kept asking myself why am I playing this game. I love these types of games, I like a challenge, riddles, puzzles, difficult battles. Though the game it self don't feel hard. To me it feels very monotonous and breaks many logical brain cells.

All the upgrades I had gained, didn't feel like they added to helping me in anyway. Gained 5 different sword hilts and was still using the one from the beginning. Charge sword I used once or twice, some sort of dive attack maybe once. Never saw a battle where either could be useful. Why dive into a enemy, when I might touch the enemy and take damage. Why would I charge up an attack that doesn't do more damage than if I just spammed my regular attack. Also why in general would you take damage if the enemy just touches you. You are wearing armor of some kind. can fall from real high up and take no fall damage but an enemy brushes your shoulder and bam you fked up and die. On top of all that the controls felt very touchy, like almost unresponsive. I had to use my d-pad cause my analog had serious issues understanding I was holding down. Never experienced that in any game before. unless I was right on point it would not register that my analog was pointing down.

I am glad they made the game and that others are enjoying it, and I have no regrets buying and supporting the devs.

in my opinion this game is not overwhelmingly positive or even positive. 
the combat and movement is lacking  ( and there is  a lot of parkour where one hit and you have to restart ) 
the exploration is meh and the metroidvenia element where you get new abilities to explore new areas is none existent.
the boss design is horrible where all bosses have about 3 attack that they spam with almost no place for punish or heal 
that means the half of the bosses are  cheesed easly and half of tham are slogs to get through 
if you are looking for a metroidvenia buy bloodstain ritual 
the pixel art is great tho

The exploration is rewarding, with every item you find providing you with more lore that fills out the picture of this unique and intimidating world. It's commitment to its theme is just sublime to witness. This is what drags you forward until the end, even if the game is fighting you every step of the way.

The gameplay, especially in comparison to the other recent metroidvanias, is shit. It lacks precision, which leads to combat and platforming just feeling a little off. Furthermore, the instant deaths from falling into a pit of spikes (as apposed to games like hollow knight and grime, which teleport you to the last stable ground with some health lost) just make platforming challenges a nightmare of attrition. 

I understand difficulty is the point, but fair difficulty is clearly a challenge and you as a developer should brainstorm that properly before trying to develop a difficult game, instead of just relying on cheap shit that just ends up frustrating the player. I've spent entire days fighting Soulsborne bosses, because they are fair and I know the only thing lacking is my skill. In Hollow Knight, its hardest platforming challenges were a joy to overcome because, due to very precise controls, once again the only thing holding me back was skill. With Blasphemous, every success just feels cheap and almost unearned because the gameplay feel is just to lacking.

Yet, when you suffer through and find a nice juicy bit of lore, or a wonderfully grotesque looking boss or awe inspiring location, is all somehow feels worth it.

I enjoyed this game so much I got the True Ending on my first ever playthrough and cannot wait to play NG+ for 100% completion of the other endings. I also am very stoked for the second installment of the series and can't wait to see where they bring the story next!

After having spent 40-ish hours getting all the achievements on this game i can confidently recommend it. It's highest selling point is the captivating atmosphere that leaves such a strong and lasting impression that I got nostalgic of it just mere months after finishing it for the first time.

I have however a few criticisms to mention however. The beads (this game's charm system) feel uninfluencial on a first playthrough while completely breaking it once you know how to combine them. I beat all of the amanecidas on second or first tries just because I couldn't die on NG+. My biggest gripe with this game has to be how poorly combat and movement mix together. Often times I felt my own character's movements were working against me, the biggest offenders being the ledge climbing mechanic (which only lets you climb on a ledge if you are on the designated spot of it despite the platform being a ""wooden"" platform) and the wall ""jump"" which has you attack the wall to cling on to it if its the kind of wall that allows it.

Disclaimer: I haven't 150% the game because I found it way too tedious to fight the same bosses a total of 4 times (5 for me because my NG+ didn't have any bindings) only to then have to 100% the game again and I haven't achieved ending C.

Blasphemous follows the traditional metroidvania style formula with many of the beloved tropes of the genre: branching paths, hidden content, equipment builds, time trials, etc. But where blasphemous really puts itself in the limelight is in the presentation of these timeless traditions of its genre. For example, your way of increasing your max HP is by taking on the sins of a naked female saint as she removes swords from her body which represent her own sins upon this earth. In other words, a high mediaeval interpretation of period cramps.

The game presents itself with the best pixel art I've ever seen in animation and general designs. All the characters both major and minor, friend and foe have received gorgeous animations with clear inspiration from Catholicism, Iberian culture and Francisco Goya’s works. The fact that with a firm knowledge of the time period and the culture it was pulling from, I was able to go “Wow! That is such a cool detail/interpretation” is both a joy to my inner history nerd and art nerd. It’s also just plain fascinating to see how such complex ideas can be turned into the forms of pixels, such as how one boss has each of it’s bejewelled hands gleam in the light of it’s magic (with the benefit that the outfit the boss wears is accurate to its position in the church). Overall the game would easily get a recommendation even if it was just an art book.

A fond highlight I found whilst playing was the combat. Whilst not on par with sole combat games like Sekiro, it consistently felt clean and responsive to inputs which is certainly a nice benchmark to have when starting the game. Loathe be the times when you have to think “I’ve got to exploit the combat to do this” rather than “I need to get better at the combat to do this”. In addition, I found particular enjoyment out of the parrying mechanic, or more accurately the portrayal of parrying. It’s become a joke across gaming that these little characters can counter giants without even budging an inch, but in Blasphemous your character slides across the floor and has to recover after parrying a colossal attack. You are still at the advantage in this situation, but it's certainly an appreciated detail.

The soundtrack was enjoyable, nothing too noteworthy I found but certainly not a game where I mute the music volume and load up spotify, so take that as you will. The main musical highlights are naturally the boss fights which range from grand orchestras to latin choirs, an interesting range of sound but all on brand for this zealous journey against the true miracle.

In conclusion, Blasphemous is a very strong playthrough with a good run length to match. Your average run will probably take around 6 to 7 hours with a fair bit of guide usage, raise that up to around 9 hours if you want to grab all the trinkets and upgrades. It has some flaws natural to the genre, such as backtracking for important items or how certain aspects/features can be missed due to either the wrong sequence of events occurring or just if the player doesn't pay enough attention. In short, a good purchase at regular £20  pricing and practically a must have at its sale price of £5.

I went in expecting a great game combining both genres but ended up getting a disapointment. Game is frustratingly hard, but not in the typical soulsborne fashion. The hitbox are atrocious, the enemy design can range from passable to making the game unplayable. Boss design is unfair (at least the few that I encountered) and on top of all that, the story (granted I did not finish the game) is just an attempt at copying the vague storytelling of Dark Souls. This ends up appearing as Dark Souls' wannabe edgy cousin. This cryptic storytelling bleeds into the gameplay, to the point where I have no idea where to go or if the areas I visited are designed for the late-game. I also felt that all the enemies had beefed up health and beefed up damage, making traversal of the metroidvanian landscape very slow, boring, and tedious. 

This all being said, keep in mind I obviously didn't play the whole game, so if you want to play it, go for it. Personally I witnessed enough to completely deter me, and judging by other reviews I've read, I'm glad I stopped so early because the game only gets more cryptic. I went in expecting Hollow Knight with Dark Souls but ended up getting NES Metroid with Dark Souls 2

I still despise the platform in this game.  It isn't satisfying, it feels clunky.  The worst moments I had in this game where I just wanted to alt f4 were doing the platforming challenges for the Bloodstained collab.  It's even worse when I have to fight and platform at the same time.
The combat in the game is very satisfying.  You have a very simple skill tree for your sword where no upgrade feels useless or like a novelty. 
While I rarely found prayers to be necessary, there are a large amount of them to find and use and almost all of them are very fun.  I would relate them to the powers in Bioshock Infinite, where you could pretty much go the whole game without using them, but they're there for you to have fun with.
I originally found the bosses in this game to be very lackluster and boring, and that still holds true for the original cast.  However, the bossfights added in Wounds of Eventide and the NG+ Amanecida bosses are really good.  Very challenging, and very fun to fight.  
The art direction in this game is fantastic.  The pixel art is beautiful, and drawing inspiration from Christianity to create a dreary, souls-like world was a good call.  Sometimes it feels like characters are just saying words that mean nothing, but that's not a big deal.  
It being a metroidvania, there is a lot of backtracking.  When I first played the game in 2019, the only form of fast travel was from using specific portals located throughout the world, of which there were about five.  This made backtracking incredibly tedious.  Since then though, one of the content updates introduced a way for you to fast travel between the bonfire shrines, which makes the game much less of an awful trek.
NG+ in this game is a lot more compelling than in others.  To go into NG+ you need to take on a gameplay challenge that will persist for the whole run.  There is also the secret NG+ bosses for you to find and fight.  Most games don't provide a good motivation for you to play again, this one does.

Seeing as a lot of things I had problems with were fixed or addressed in content updates, I felt it right to change my harsh review.  My second playthrough of this game was wonderful (save the platforming...) and I expect I'll play it a third time in the future.  7.5/10",1568339319,1672688744,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It supports cloud saving, but you cannot seamlessly switch from deck to PC and back again, as they are separate save files.  Looking into this, this is something the developer has to handle on their end.  So be aware that if you buy this game, your Deck saves and local/PC saves will be separate... unless you're running Linux on your PC, I guess.  It's really something that oughta be in the damned ""great on deck!"" info box... not a deal-breaker, but it was frustrating to learn about this the hard way.

ADDITIONALLY: This is NOT a ""Souls-like"" game.  It has some similarities to Dark Souls, most notably in the setting and how it tells stories, but in terms of gameplay mechanics it has a lot more in common with Hollow Knight than Dark Souls.  There IS a New Game+ mode that replicates a lot of Dark Souls concepts, however.

That out of the way, Blasphemous is pretty great.  Fantastic and weird art and aesthetics, excellent music and sound design, and while I would say the controls and gameplay aren't as refined as some of the finest examples in the Metroidvania genre like Super Metroid or Hollow Knight, they get the job done most of the time.

There are certainly frustrations to be found, but given that the game doesn't much punish you for failure other than being sent back to spawn/loading from save, they're not especially cumbersome.  There ARE some areas added in the DLC that are clearly intended to be tackled in New Game+ or otherwise very close to the end of the game when you're fully powered up, and they're very frustrating before that point... so that's something to keep in mind.  If you're seeing pirate ships, you might want to explore elsewhere until you're close to the end of the game.  I didn't learn about this until I buckled and decided to check guides/information on what to do about this seemingly ""Nintendo hard"" section.

Overall, the game's difficulty tends to be oversold, as these things often are.  Most bosses can be face-tanked through and through, once you recognize enough of their pattern to avoid at least SOME of the damage incoming.  There's plenty of space for challenge runs and one of the achievements does indeed require you to kill all of the core bosses without healing, so you can certainly make things tougher on yourself if you desire... but don't shy away from this game thinking it's ""too hard for average players.""

Character progression is quite a lot similar to Hollow Knight, with items and upgrades largely adding new abilities or gimmicks, rather than straight stat upgrades as in Castlevania-style games.  You do have a rosary that you can attach beads to that provide stat boosts or other adjustments to your parameters, and this functions much like the charms from Hollow Knight... although, sadly, you cannot over-charm in this game for extra risk-reward.  Also like Hollow Knight, your spells are fueled by damaging enemies, although you have a set number of heals rather than healing being one of your spells.  Similar to Dark Souls, you can find more empty flasks and pay an NPC of sorts to increase your stocks.  Another NPC, added via DLC, can increase the potency of your flasks in exchange for reducing your total number of flasks.

Side note - you can press and hold B (or whatever button you bind to your ranged attack) to cut yourself, sacrificing HP to gain mana (called Fervour in this game.)  I don't remember seeing this mentioned ANYWHERE in tutorial pop-ups, but it's a very useful ability and is required to access a few hidden items, so... yeah, weird it's not mentioned anywhere.

The (free) DLCs added a few new areas, a completely new ""golden ending"" route, and apparently numerous improvements to NPCs, so the game is quite good now.  There's also a crossover event with the excellent Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night (another Metroidvania that I'd highly recommend!  It's also got quite a nice selection of mods!), where you'll encounter Miriam in a mid-game area and unlock access to some challenge rooms.  These rooms are all pure platforming and, while challenging, aren't quite on the level of the ultimate White Palace runs in Hollow Knight... which is probably a good thing, as while Blasphemous' platforming is enjoyable, it's not the most precise.

Definitely recommend this game if you're into Metroid/Hollow Knight-style Metroidvanias.  Definitely one of the best entries into that subgenre I've played, and even at full price it's a great value.",1672645956,1672645956,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The sounds overall are amazing, from the soundtrack to enemy sounds. Paired with the BEAUTIFULL aesthetic, it makes for incredible ambience.

The reason why I don't recommend the game is because it has bugs and inconsistencies. Which I usually overlook - hell, I played a shit ton of Skyrim - but in a difficulty-focused game, that has punishing consequences for dying and all, can really make you get that kind of rage where it truly feels like it's the game's fault for your last death, and not yours, which you NEVER wanna make your players feel.

(For concrete example: i've been trying to progress through an area, and there's this one enemy that sometimes glitches out and becomes untargetable. I mostly didn't care, but then I got to a section that locks you in there and makes you kill three of them. And happened 3 times already, I go the very long way to get to that part, try to get there with good enough health, and then the enemy glitches and I have to do it all over again. That's frustration. And on the topic of inconsistency, I mainly think the parry mechanic simply DECIDES not to work sometimes, and I take full damage, and that's bad.)",1672594341,1672594341,False,1,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

You will die, a lot, but thats kinda the only way to get better. You will have to learn what attacks you can parry and what attacks you can only dodge. Some can be parried, some can be parried but you will not get to counter due to knock back, and most ranged attacks cannot be parried, most. Success through trial and error is the only way to go. 

The art is amazing, abilities and enemies are original, and the best part of all, the voice acting. Blasphemous has amazing voices for its characters. The story is good too, at the start you'll have no clue what's going on but things will make sense later. 

Blasphemous is challenging too, while I wouldn't say it's as difficult as Souls games the platforming can get annoying. Spikes insta kill, you can only get onto platforms from the sides or if you land on top of them. You can take quite a bit of damage from just one hit, and some attacks make you go flying into the air, often knocking you off a platform, or worse, into spikes. 

Some bosses are hard, some are surprisingly easy. 4 out of the 17 bosses I beat the first try, those being Lady of the Charred Visage, Perpetva, Esdras, and Ten Piedad. The rest took me some more tries.

One of the few things I don't like about the game is that if you literally touch any enemy, you take damage, I think this feature should be removed and only kept on bosses and certain enemies. Something else that has made me quit is the portal system. I actually think the system used is unique and good, what I don't like is how there are so few portals. I think they should just be removed and idk, add a purchasable item or one that can be found somewhere well hidden that allows you to teleport anywhere. Not literally anywhere, the same locations as the portals.

[i]Blasphemous[/i] is for the most part a good game. It is pretty consistent in its themes, motifs, you name it. And though I would have liked it better to have it accessible in the first playthrough, NG+ offers amazing bonus content. The Amanecidas are simply *chefskiss*. The soundtrack has a couple bangers and is otherwise very decent. Although I was not fond of the English voices, the Spanish ones are superb. It is unsurprising that people enjoy and like the game so much.
And that is precisely it, not bad, but disappointing. The entire time I could not help but think that [i]Blasphemous[/i] never quite manages to shake off the influence of [i]Dark Souls[/i]. There are plenty of 2D attempts at copying the formula, [i]Salt and Sanctuary[/i] comes to mind, for example. Ultimately, I found that [i]Blasphemous[/i] disappoints exactly there, just “another one”. It is [i]Dark Souls[/i], but 2D, with a big helping of Catholicism.
I often kept wondering “Why?” about so many things. Certainly, the pixel art is good, as in well-made, but should that not be our base expectation? Sure, the Lady of the Six Sorrows is inspired by Mater Dolorosa and a certain painting, but now what? Mere reproduction does not make a point at all. And that is what I ended up with, realizing that maybe I get it and hey, I can feel clever about it now, but then what? Everything seems absurdly gratuitous, not just the general Catholic angst, for lack of a better word, just [i]everything[/i]. Mountains shaped like weeping women, for instance, could be good, because this gives the setting a very surreal, dream-like atmosphere (quite fitting all things considered), but on the other hand, it feels like just another thing that is in there just for its own sake. “Here, have another, have we reminded you yet that this is angsty self-flagellating Catholic land where no one is ever happy and everybody bleeds all the time?” Yes, you literally have a couple seconds ago, but thanks for the reminder anyhow. I found this to be not a decaying world of undead with the odd sentient being on the verge of hollowing, but instead a severe case of “Why does anyone even live there?”. Just look at the map with its depressing barren landscape of brown-greyish jagged rocks. I cannot find it inspiring and sad rather than simply trying way too hard.
Venture into another area and here we go again, everything is crucified, burning, impaled, or otherwise bleeding all over the place, maybe some mournful monster is bashing their head against a wall or whatever. As mentioned, gratuitous. And hopelessly edgy. Hell, the setting is called “Cvstodia” with a v, as not only is it more like a Latin inscription, but also very cvlt and black metal. Play on and I can only roll my eyes at yet another “brutal” custom execution animation for some enemy. “Eat your guts, come on, eat them!” Yeah, [i]whatever[/i], can I move on now, please? I really do not care.
The very first enemy had me sighing during the cutscene. Yes, I get it, he baptizes himself with the blood and it seeps from a wound just like the one of Christ on the cross. But it never improved from there. Instead, I found myself bombarded with imagery that was if nothing else consistent, yet seemed more like an infantile fantasy of how “mature” games work than anything else. It must be brutal, because so is [i]Dark Souls[/i], yes? Let us add some more anguish, why not. There is merit in holding back, if only to make the suffering we see that much more impactful.
On the flipside, we have platforming sections with dripping snot obstacles and breaking platforms that reform a second later much like a 90s platformer, but in a bad way, for these severely undercut the angsty suffering overload, as I could not help but imagine the character with a cartoon animal mascot skin. Petty it may be, but I had similar feelings about the Catholic laser magic. On a technical level, it all works, but when I am arduously climbing up inches at a time by ramming my sword into the wall only to get hurt by rancid pipe snot a moment later, I cannot help but become conflicted about the game’s direction.
I would wager the biggest offender to me was a severe lack of identity. This seems odd, as identity might be the one thing [i]Blasphemous[/i] is truly good at, if you look at people’s reactions. And I can relate, as I see the potential. The issue lies in the execution. Do not just bombard the player with angsty Catholic imagery and call it a day, do something with it instead. Yes, this is a gorgeous re-creation in pixel art, but then what? Gwyn is kind of like Zeus, but this is not what makes him interesting. Another “Ah, this is X in Catholicism/painting Y, you see!” moment adds precious little to the game if this is all we ever get. Meaning is function in context.
Why do we have a currency we lose and can retrieve upon death? [i]Dark Souls[/i]. Why are there “meaningful” item descriptions (even entire short stories of dubious literary merit hidden behind a confidently named “lore” button)? [i]Dark Souls[/i].

Now the aftertaste of the game became sour and I regret playing it further.

It started out so cool!! The graphics were awesome, the world felt mysterious and deep, and you wanted to learn all about the (in hindsight, overly) intricate lore and see all the skills and weapons you could unlock for your character. But +40 hours in and I still barely understand the lore at all (why do I have to kill the pope again?), you get zero information or even hints for the quests and literally HAVE to rely on guides and tutorials. God forbid you miss something, or you’ll be locked out of a questline or ending, even though there are zero hints to this. It’s like they don’t bother trying to bring the player into the world at all, no effort to make us understand and feel part of it. It’s just force feeding lore that is so obviously written to feel like Dark Souls but desperately tries to be edgier and deeper. This gets especially annoying when you have to read through a lot of text on every item just to decipher that the item gives +1 defense or damage, but you're never truly sure because of how vague it is. And the clunky movements have reeeaaally gotten on my nerve now, especially when the world is filled with instant death spikes and strategically placed groups of enemies. Also, the skills you unlock are not nearly as satisfying or useful as I was hoping for compared to the games that it’s inspired by either, you barely ever feel ""upgraded"". I can go on...

Anyway, the game is basically a mix between the Dark Souls series and Hollow Knight, but they haven't understood what made those games good and instead focused all their effort on drowning the the player in confusing lore. In short, it leans towards ""all show and no substance"" once you’ve experienced the entire game unfortunately. The game so badly wants to be Dark Souls with a retro feel, but it’s like they didn't truly understand what made the DS-series good to begin with.

Sorry for sounding so salty, trust me when I say that I really wanted to like this game because I adore the art style and worldbuilding they went for. It had incredible potential! If you want to give this game a try, stick to just one playthrough...

Okay, I don't want to be this harsh with an indie game but damn is this game the bazaar of bug fck fest. Enemies will go off screen and suddenly teleport in the middle and attack you, even the final boss goes off screen so you can't do anything about him until he comes back on the screen. There are multiple instances where characters will just disappear during cutscenes. Enemy AI that just stands there in a daze or sometimes gets stuck in the ladder. There was even one time when an enemy spawned twice even though I had just kill it. There are glitches where projectiles hit you even though you are outside the hitbox. 

The levels are raggedly designed, platforming are f tier at its best. This game will try so much to waste a lot of your time by adding a bunch of nonsense. There are multiple times wherein an enemy will just stand in the ladder or in the ledge and you can't do anything about it because the moment that you leap or try to climb the ladder, these enemies will throw projectiles at you that goes through anything and you fall and die by the spikes.

Now, let's talk about the save points, the save points are not thought so well, throughout the game I had to backtrack a hundred kilometers just to turn in a quest, or if I die from an enemy that I can't see that is firing projectiles from like 4 screens below, horrible placement. Even the fight with the second to the last boss, my guy had to run a marathon in order to get killed again over and over again. And not to mention, this is the boss that suddenly changed its pattern when it is about to die.

This game tried so hard to be dark souls and failed in so many levels. Probably the one thing that this game copied right is that the damage scaling are ridiculous, A lot of enemies here can kill you with two to three hits, and in some cases, flurries you with a bunch of combos and you get hit once and you die because the knock back on this game is unreal. Damn, the knockback, specially in boss fights, one hit and you would be lying in the ground for what seems like a lifetime, enough for enemies to finish you off, and if you are fighting multiple enemies and you get hit once, then goodbye hallelujah lullaby. see you tomorrow cause you die. 

And man, the healing mechanics of this game, it takes like 5 seconds for the animation to be done. Like come on, is it really necessary for the avatar to break the fourth wall and wink at the player every time he heals? And the hearts are totally useless, gives a little bit of bonus and twice the problem.

The story lines are all over the place with names of levels that are very easy to forget. I will not consider this a metroidvania. The only thing you backtrack to is a couple of collectibles and that's about it.

The music slaps though and the voice acting are on point. Characters are interesting and the mobs are very diverse. It's just that it didn't align that much with this game.

this game is 5/10 at its best. 2/10 at its worst. If you are even thinking of playing this game because it is souls like, don't. If there are any souls like game left in the market, then I suggest you played this as the last one. It's that terrible.",1672382294,1672382294,False,1,0,0.48598131537437439,0,True,False,False

The overall theme is just cool as fuck: Becoming the Pyramid Head equivalent of a Roman-Catholic executioner is seriously badass. The world itself is built really neat as there is a lot to dive into story-wise as well as level discovery. The gameplay itself is pretty cool in of itself as well. The different relics and augments that you can use to change how you approach gameplay is in my opinion done really well, and the riposte mechanic is A+++. I love it. A couple things to note though as far as some downside potential goes:

Platforming in certain places will absolutely piss you off. It definitely had me raging here and there. There's a certain set of trials that pop up later in portal sections that, unless you look up or discover by accident how to actually interact with, are godawful to deal with. Once you get the platforming down though this game becomes infinitely more fun. Some of the enemy encounters are also irritating however I have found that less annoying than the previously-mentioned platforming things.

Another thing to praise real quick: The soundtrack. Absolutely to die for. It's definitely good, however Strife & Ruin is one of the greatest pieces of OST to ever grace the ears. That song alone is easily a valid sole reason to buy the OST even by itself.

Overall I say this game is well worth both your time and money. Even without a sale I say it is well worth the asking price.

I am happy to say that the developers put some work in and fixed most of my gripes, so much so that I would now highly recommend this game.

As you likely noticed, Blasphemous is one in a sea of souls like titles that flood the steam marketplace today. However, Blasphemous is the real deal and I believe is to date the best 2D iteration of souls like game play available. The difficulty is tuned (for better or for worse) to be right up to the line between rewarding and frustrating, and dances there for the entire game. While If you like Dark Souls, you might dig this game, if you don't like Dark Souls you will likely despise it.

Game play aside, the game does a fantastic job creating an unsettling and bizarre atmosphere that is carried through the entire game. The player is given just enough information to create intrigue but never enough that it feels our questions have been answered. Quests in this game are often cryptic and with multiple outcomes derived from actions that are less than obvious (or not obvious at all), and usually end in tragedy. The player will never feel at home in this world, and that is exactly what I enjoy about it.

For those who are interested and have never delved into ""souls"" difficulty, the game is not by any means insanely difficult and is instead designed to intimidate the player. Once you accept that death is part of the experience and push through your comfort zone, you will likely find conquering the many challenges in this game to be very rewarding.",1575420232,1672041446,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Im gonna start off with this, I am not opposed to the git gud mentality to a certain extend. I sl1 dark souls 1 and have done a couple Elden Ring challenges. I also understand that comparing to dark souls or a pure platformer is unfair but its really hard not too when it wears its inspiration on its sleeve that much. The platform is terrible even in its style, it was unresponsive, I dont think there any coyote time and it leads to a very clunk design that is only made worse by enemy placement. With some upgrades the combat gained depth but never to the point I would call it entertaining or engaging. I personally dont think the spikes should be insta kills, but if the game had better movement I would actually understand that. Bosses are generally speaking so far, although I am only in Jondo. Extremely dis interesting and tedious. This is more of a problem with the movement and combat than boss design. I guess you could say this a metroidvania in the same way dark souls 1 is a metroidvania. Despite it still being done worse here, a staple of metroidvanias is unlocking new movement abilities that make future combat encounters and platforming more intersting. I understand the grounded approach here however with how stale the gameplay is it is not for its benefit. even just a double jump or wall jump would have made combat and platforming so much more interesting. Some pros are I enjoy the lore somewhat although I find the story itself to not be engaging yet at least. The art is great, the executions are awesome although not frequent enough or I havent figured out how to get them more often yet. The background pixel art is quite good and its overall a pretty game. Back to it, ""bonfire"" placements are a little too far apart especially when you factor in everything else. A big tell for blasphemous is from the first boss to the second there is 40% drop for players. While there is nothing wrong with a game not being for everyone that is a substantial number that not only shows its niche audience which I considered myself to be in before actually playing it, but it also outlines that there are inherent game flaws there. Despite what I said I don't think it is a completely awful game I just think it could have been significantly better. Sorry but one last comparison here, blasphemous was what I thought Dark Souls 1 was going to be like, and not in a good way. I went into ds1 expecting absolute bullshit like spending my first hour in lordran running into the catacombs, but once I found my way and realized for the most part it is a fantastic and fair game. I was waiting for that here and while sure I don't have much playtime, it has not done anything to pull me in mechanically, and for the most part the narrative as well. If you like this array of genres you could 100% enjoy this game and I do recommend you try it, however don't go in expecting a 90% game. By doing that you are setting your expectations too high and undermining the game by setting expectations too high. Also in the description call this a skilled hack and slash is comical, it does not take all that much skill, and its sure as hell not a hack and slash. Still think the lore and setting is very cool though, just wish the game would've done it justice, at least in the beginning maybe it gets better.

As promised, I finished the game or at least one of the endings, mine is likely considered the bad ending but it was still quite great and I think it ties in with the themes of the game very well. Now that I am done I will keep this shorter. The story is very good, the art is quite good, I actually like the map design quite a bit although I feel it is brought down still with dis interesting and tedious level design. This mostly has to do with enemy placement in my opinion and some of the features the enemy has. There are lots of charms and relics I didn't play with I only found one and I actually believe that on may be necessary to actually complete a later part of them. The combat towards the end game does fell better however I feel it may take too long to get to that point and even then it ends up very repetitive, but it does get better and I feel that towards the end game it is actually a serviceable and sometimes engaging system. Out of all the bosses I fought which was probably just all the required ones not sure tbh, I think I found one or two both mechanically engaging and fun. Other bosses would either be mechanically engaging and tedious, or just tedious. This isn't a spoiler, just my opinion. The final boss is quite bad, definitely a huge letdown. Luckily it didn't place a stain on the story for me, but It really isn't great. The overall difficulty throughout the entire game varies greatly sometimes going from extremely easy to a little bullshit in minutes. After finishing the game I do actually have a more positive view of it over all. I think I would actually recommend this game if it is on sale, I think for the money on sale you are getting a lot of content and if you feel similar flaws that I do, well it was 6$ and there is still some great stuff in there so it is worth it. If i had bought this game at full price though it would be a much different story. Similar to what I said before Blasphemous is a game that needs to be judged alone on its own merit and not compared to other games (for the most part) however even in a vaccum, it is no 9/10 for me. Probably closer to 7, which still isnt bad at all for how miserable I was at the 3 or so hour mark.",1671874784,1672021639,True,0,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False

However, instead of making a fun game, the devs decided to take the worst out of every game it tried so hard to copy, just to fk with the players by making their life difficult for no reason. Before writing this review, I took a quick look at the reviews by other players to make sure that I am not the only one feeling this way. 

[b]Artstyle[/b] 
- High quality pixel art which is the main selling point. Love the pixelated ultra violence. 

[b]SFX/BGM[/b]
- Sound effect is okay, but background music is literally the same few notes on loop. Voice acting is garbage.

[b]Story/Lore[/b]
 - Tried way too hard to be DarkSouls. Everything is unnecessarily mysterious to the extend that I skip almost every dialogue since it would make no sense nor difference whether I read them or otherwise.

[b]Gameplay[/b] - Absolute garbage. Let's go through in detail:
- Controls - Clunky, unresponsive and buggy. There are a few occasions where my character would charge a strong attack for no reason, which I am pretty sure I did not long hold the attack button; Clinging on to ledges requires you to hold the attack button and the direction button at the same time, however when you attempt to jump on a ladder from a ledge, you need to release the attack button [u]before[/u] hitting the up button, else your character would just fall into oblivion.
- Stages - Incredibly unreasonable amount of insta-kill pitfalls all over the map. Most jumps require you to be extremely precise, whereby a 0.01mm difference can cost you your life. With the horrible controls, I would say that more than 50% of the deaths felt unfair, cheap and frustrating. 
- Enemies - Some enemies telegraph their attacks so badly that it's almost impossible to react to them while having to observe your surrounding to ensure you don't dodge into a insta-kill pitfall. Enemies are also very inconsistent, in the sense that you can't tell which attack you can dodge through, which can parry, which can interrupt etc. That is not the worst. There is this particular enemy's laser beam that is blocked by walls sometimes, and on other times it will pass through walls and peg you before you know it.
- Bosses - I have not met any yet in my 3 hours of gameplay. Why? Because the developers decided to artificially lengthen the game by making the players traverse uninteresting platforms while fighting the same enemies over and over again. Oh you died? Congratulations, now you have to repeat the entire process until you find the next bonfire. 

[b]Conclusion[/b]
- Punishing games are fun, simply because players feel a sense of achievement when they beat a certain stage/ boss. Every single death adds to the learning curve, allowing the player to ""improvise adapt overcome"" the situation and not to repeat the same mistake. This is what make games like DarkSouls, Hollow Knight etc successful to begin with.
- For the case of Blasphemous, the gameplay is just blasphemy. The game punishes you for deaths that are not entirely your fault. When you respawn and attempting to try again, the game punishes you for doing so, by shoving the sheer amount of repetitiveness in your face. When I finally clear a stage, instead of feeling a sense of achievement, I felt a sense of relief, which is the similar feeling I get when I manage to squeeze out a turd after stuck in me for days. In short, the whole experience simply left a sour aftertaste. 
- I won't recommend this game even with current deep sales of 75% off. For the same price range, you can get better and more fun games of similar genre such as Ori, Hollow Knight, or Ender Lilies. Just don't waste your time and money on this garbage.",1671976587,1671976776,False,1,0,0.412132024765014648,0,True,False,False

I thought the Souls-like aspect would make this game much harder than the other Metroidvanias I have played (Which is kind of a lot), but surprisingly in some parts it made it much easier, like enemies not respawning until you die, unlike, for example, Symphony of the night in which the enemies would respawn everytime you left the room. The parry system was useful too, you can just parry most enemies instead of tanking the damage and relying on healing items.

Tried playing on my Surface Book 2 originally. The performance was absolutely terrible no matter how much I fiddled with resolution and other graphics settings. This was a laptop that could comfortably play a bunch of relatively modern 3D games in 1080p. It was unplayable.

Tried playing on my Macbook M1 Pro. Controllers don't work. At all, as far as I can tell. Saw a person with the same issue in the Community asking for help and they were told to contact Valve or Apple for a fix. I mean: it's not like controllers aren't working with other games: just this one!

I got the game on sale and quite a lot of time after the release. I've heard quite negative reviews when it first came out, but it seems either situation has changed or those people were wrong in the first place. Visuals are gorgeous, combat so far feels good (needed some time to get used to) and enough fluid, even though I clearly didn't get even close to all of the updates and moves. Atmosphere is nice. Platforming is good enough for my tastes, BUT! INSTAKILL SPIKES! ARE! BULLSHIT!

It's not very clear how exactly map is spaced - why one location has a clear sky, but right above it there is another location with a mountain, and there's an elevator that can bring you back to said location STRAIGHT DOWN FROM THE SKY. Similarly, when I traverse some of underground tunnels, while still being clearly underground, I come out to the clear sky again. Fast-travel map partly clears up the situation: those are supposed to be different parts of the overworld with their own underground rooms, but it sometimes throw me out of immersion.

I'm currently at 41% of uncovered map, and so far I was only given slight general direction - get three things to open the door. Not sure how much more plot is going to evolve, lore so far is kinda vague, but I'm not a good judge. If my opinion significantly changes after the completion, I'll update the review.

Did I say how great is the visual style?

UPD with 62.6 hours: Most of my opinions are there, but NG+ is there just to slow everything down without any additional power progress. You're at the top of your abilities and enemies have more health and attack with greater strength. Maybe that's the souls-like bit biting me in the ass, but I'd enjoy the hard mode way more if I could upgrade further.

This game really doesn't have good first impressions. The first area looks fairly unimpressive, but if you give it just some time you'll see some very well done pixel art with a very unique aesthetic through its art direction and setting. I can't think of any game with a similar 'vibe'. One thing I noted here was how it used multiple layers of 2D backgrounds which moved around to give depth to environments, like how Castlevania Symphony of the Night.

The music is phenomenal. Like with the visuals, the game really holds itself back at the start but as you keep playing, you will see a lot of amazing tracks that lend to the atmosphere or create memorable boss fights. The DLC specific tracks are particularly memorable.

[h1]Gameplay [/h1] 
I like the combat. As you progress and make your sword stronger, you get some combos and moves, though it's fairly simple. The game takes a methodical approach with your timing of when to commit to a combo or special move to gain the right position, which makes figuring out a bosses pattern a fun experience. Through various items, there's enough variety for builds and playstyle.

I don't think the bosses in general are particularly hard, but some stand out, especially towards the end.

The areas are very well-designed for traversal. This game probably has my favorite implementation of the interconnected design that is found in metroidvanias. It is a massive map and seeing it all come together so well is an experience.

I see a lot of people comparing it to a souls-like and while there are some elements to it that seem that way, I would argue that the game borrows more from Castlevania Symphony of the Night in its movement, locations, bosses etc though it polishes up on it and removes superfluous elements.

[h1]Story and Worldbuilding[/h1]
Yeah, I do not know what happened here, but I am intrigued. There is a fair bit of dialogue in this game combined with a bunch of text you can read or find, but it is still a very baffling setting. Steeped in religious imagery, this is a world where the supernatural seems to be deified and venerated, while leading to seemingly negative effects too.

There is a lot I will not mention for spoilers and even more that I do not comprehend, but what I did get was an imaginative setting paired with some stellar art direction.",1671131647,1671131647,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

I finished the game before reviewing.
EDIT: 100% completion review in comments below.

[h1]TL;DR[/h1]
""Hey, this game looks great, nice pixel art, let me buy it!""

*several hours later*

Oh...

... it's bad...

Beautiful pixel-art and visual design, but also slogfest in jank-city. This game is a bit ass. It's biggest sin is seemingly deliberate inconsistency in mechanics.

It's probably the worst metroidvania that I still semi-enjoyed for at least some parts.

Not recommended, because 2D metroidvania genre is saturated with much better games. For some recommendations scroll down to the end.

[h1]Description[/h1]
Blasphemous is a 2D metroidvania. You play as a knight who's penance is not speaking. In order to repent he needs to defeat a bunch of baddies. That's about what you can get out of the story of this game unless you dive deep into analysis and interpretation.

You mainly run, jump, climb, slide and slash your way through the game in search of items to collect and bosses to kill.

Combat is simple, you have a sword, witch which you can slash. Hitting an enemy multiple times performs a combo, which can be extended through leveling. You can also parry attack and riposte some attacks after parrying. On top of that you get some magic spells, which are charged by hitting and killing enemies. You also have a dodge, which can pass through some enemies in some instances.

Kills give you points which can be spent on unlocking/upgrading skills like downward slash or charged slash.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
[b]+ Pixel art[/b]
From characters to backgrounds - everything has a lot of quality. There are some nice animations like finishers, which you can trigger sometimes when lowering enemy HP enough and pressing Y.

[b]+ Atmosphere/world design[/b]
It's interesting. The world is weird, but pretty original, although Dark Souls influence is obvious.

[b]+ Control customization[/b]
Wasn't planned, added post-launch. I appreciate it.

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[b]- Inconsistent[/b]
Game does not react in a predictable manner.

Some enemies can be dodged through, others can't. Others let you pass through only during specific animations. Yet other can be passed but only from the back, while yet others can only be passed from the front. Game does not communicate this possibilites. So, fuck you, you have to try and risk getting hit by every scenario.

Likewise, some attacks can be parried, others cannot. Wanna know which ones? Fuck you.

Some enemies deal damage on contact. Some don't. Wanna figure out which ones? Do it by trial and error. Also, fuck you.

And a cherry on top - same enemies taking different amounts of hits from the same ability to kill, from as little as 1 hit to 5+.

Because. Fuck. You.

[b]- Unresponsive[/b]
There is some weirdness to the controls. For example: stopping to duck and attack takes more time than just ducking and attacking from stand-still. Trying to get on a ladder mid-air is strangely specific in which moment you need to press up to start climbing and the game puts 1-shot-kill spikes below in case you miss.

Hollow Knight dealt with this much better by just taking some HP on spikes/pits and letting you retry as long as you still had some left.

[b]- Slogfest[/b]
Many enemies require slow, parry and riposte playstyle. Some enemies take 20+ hits, can't be avoided or dodged through and are placed in multiple places along certain pathways that makes you slog through them for a long time. And if you get careless - you lose a lot of HP, so you have to take your time. Yawn.

[b]- Contact damage/unreliable dodge[/b]
I begin to hate lazy games having enemies do contact damage, especially when the game is also trying to be ""difficult"" first. But Hollow Knight also had contact damage and it didn't bother me too much there, so what's different here?

The difference is that Blasphemous's dodge is short, your hitbox is big and enemy sprites are also big. Unless you are perfectly close to an enemy when you dodge trough them - you will get caught by their hitbox as you leave your immunity frames from the dodge. The other, more important difference is that Blasphemous wants to be more focused on combat, but it simply doesn't have the variety of moveset to deal with defending/high-HP enemies well, unlike some proper combat-focused metroidvanias like Dust.

[b]- Non-story[/b]
Dark Souls style of storytelling and worldbuilding, but without the gameplay to back it up and motivate you.

Blasphemous has some story, but the context and goals of your actions are confusing to say the least. The game barely explains why is the world in the state that it's in or why you are supposed to do things that you do. The explanation is there if you put together all the conversations and item descriptions, but the problem is that it's not complex or interesting enough to warrant such obfuscation. Most conversations will feel like gibberish unless you reference a bunch of them together, because they use weird terminology and different names in a way that assumes protagonist's familiarity with them. I was not motivated to uncover the story, unlike games like Dust.

Proper story would be appreciated and you can still have worldbuilding on top of that.

[b]- Bad tutorials[/b]
One of the first tutorials in the game ""teaches"" you how to extend your jump by hitting an enemy mid-air. It says you have to press X+RT after hitting the enemy (X being the attack button).

This is simply wrong.

You are not supposed to hit the enemy and then perform the X+RT, just hold RT the whole time while hitting the enemy.

The game gives you 1 enemy to test this on, said enemy dies in 1 hit and doesn't return, so you can't even properly practice what the game just told you. AND you can't review past tutorials in any menu on top of all that.

This is stupidity of game design at it's finest. If you are going to teach a mechanic to the player, especially when the input method isn't immediately obvious, then let them practice it, better yet - keep the explanation on the screen and create an obstacle that can only be passed by using the mechanic correctly.

There are more examples of misleading skill descriptions, like downward slam, which says press down+X while falling, when the real input is HOLD down+X in the air.

[h1]Lowdown[/h1]
This review just turned out to be a lot of comparisons to the objectively better Hollow Knight. Both games are metroidvanias, but Hollow Knight focuses on being a good platformer, while Blasphemous tries to be more combat-centric, but ends up being too shallow to compete with proper 2D combat platformers like Dust or Odin's Sphere Leifthrasir.

Plus all the inconsistency.

It's difficulty comes solely from not motivating you enough to keep trying at it. I finished it, but I can't say I loved it at all.

I'd give Blasphemous a mediocre score of
[h1]5/10[/h1]

Here's a list of games I recommend instead of Blasphemous (with my steam review links for some):
[b]Hollow Knight[/b] - obviously
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197998873734/recommended/367520/
[b]Infernax[/b] - small, modern-feeling metroidvania with crisp, NES-style graphics
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197998873734/recommended/374190/
[b]Dust: An Elysian Tail[/b] - almost a 2D brawler, very flashy
[b]Shantae[/b] series - easier than most metroidvanias, but full of charm
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197998873734/recommended/1191630/
If you have a PS4 or a PS5 - [b]Odin's Sphere Leifthrasir[/b] - not a metroidvania, but a great 2D brawler with great story and voice acting as well as amazing, hand-drawn graphics.

And something that has far less attention than it deserves:
[b]Dark Devotion[/b] - bold, combat-heavy dungeon-crawler-platformer that succeeds in what Blasphemous doesn't - creating an interesting, fun and demanding 2D combat system. And it has NO lazy-ass contact damage to boot!

I beat Sierpes and Isidora. the DLC content had more interesting boss fights, the bosses however felt too tanky, which is never a good way to make a boss fight harder. the mechanics were pretty good, and could be easily countered with the right tools. very disappointed i could not get to the Traitor, and so to the True Ending on the same run.

Its primarily a Metroidvania with a little bit of souls-like elements. The artwork is beautiful to look at and the level design is really good with a high emphasis on exploration.(Exploration which is both rewarding and ease the difficulty of the game).

Now for the combat, we use the same weapon for the entire playthrough, with upgrade to its damage and to unlock few special moves. The game also has magic which is called prayers in game, and few extra wearables that will lend its helpfulness for both some tough areas and bosses.

Since we are using a single weapon for the entire game, the gameplay feels more linear than it should have. The best example is all the boss fights, there are about a dozen in the base game , and are really creative, unique, and have interesting attack patterns but you deal with all of them pretty much the same way.
>dodge their bullshit attacks.
>do as much damage as possible when you got a chance.
>rinse and repeat until the boss has bean defeated.
I know dark souls pretty much has the same gameplay loop but you get more variety in playstyle and builds and it is way more rewarding when you defeat the bosses in them like you can get the boss weapons for yourself.

In This game some bosses yield cool weapons but you dont get any oppurtinity to get them so in my opinion boss fights are not really rewarding.
Evenhough bosses are well designed,but due to having a really similar gameplay loop coupled with way too much health bar(or you do so little damage to them),makes the boss fights longer, frustating and more of a tedious chore to complete.Platforming can also be frustating fuck in few levels.

Despite the few setbacks the game has, it is still an addictive game if Im being honest, if not I wouldn't have played for 30+ hours in last few days.

For starters, everything is hidden. Everything. No quest items have any description on what they do, your only way to finding out is a) randomly stumbling on something, b) trial and error every NPC to see if they accept the item (doesn't even work most of the time) or c) going to the internet, but even then you realize you had to have used the item before killing boss X, so good luck next playthrough.

If you expect a good metroidvania, as in getting new exploration abilities and backtracking, forget it. There's only a couple of those skills, and you get them basically at the end of the game. They are hidden bonuses not required to finish the game in any way.

I didn't even do any of the ""expansion"" bits, because they are so hidden I never found them.

As for combat, enemies can one-shot you. Any fall is fatal, which is fine, but being hit will knock you half the screen away, and very often levels are designed in a way that this will kill you. Dodging is inconsistent, you never know if you can slide through an enemy or not. For example in the first boss [spoiler]you can't slide through, until he does an specific attack that requires you do so, it's very confusing[/spoiler]. There's no immunity frames, when you get hit you lose control for a significant amount of time, leading to stunlocks (rare but can happen). Another inconsistency is that you can reflect some projectiles, and some you can't (no indication). There's an upgrade that supposedly lets you reflect more stuff, but even then it dosn't work a lot of the time, so it's total trial and error.

Platforming is inconsistent. You can't grab most ledges, and again falling is instant death, leading to a lot of frustration.",1670502353,1670679143,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Too bad for the story.Too bad for the artwork
I REGRET PAYING even 5$ for it on sale
As is the case with MOST INDI GAMES the studio that is creating the game is small and the end product is not as thought out & as tested as other big games. 
Its indi for a reason


THE GOOD PARTS
The art looks really good 10/10
The story must be interesting 10/10


THE BAD PARTS
1.Its made in these simple frames like that old Prince of Persia shit its not linear & doesn't flow like HUNTDOWN for example 
2.You get caught.snagged on pixels
Games like these with the pixelated 2D graphics shouldn't be that ""strict"" when it comes to gameplay.
They should relax a little.Make the gameplay more fun.But here even from the beginning when you meet the first opponents some stone cross carrying lady when you jump over her you can see that your character flies over her completely only to get snagged and drawn back
Then again its stupid that you get damaged when you just bump into opponents,not when they hit you,just when you bump into them ... and already the field of play is small.The game is just too strict when it comes to the ""invisible couture"" of your character & your opponents.There should be some pixel overlapping possible ... or if you don't want that then make the playing field much bigger
3.THE GAME IS TOO HARD ... even from the beginning and it resets you way back 
I wanted to say that I like that the character has dash,jump,parry ... it makes you feel really in control of your character ... but then when you get attacked ""diagonally"" or by multiple opponents at once or that you get damage even by them bumping into you or that the play field is so small ... then all that control options of your character don't amount to much shit

Also why the ledge grab ???? ... make a fucking platform that you can jump on between levels of terrain anywhere
Fuck your ""just corners existing & the middle is hollow dumb shit"" 
If you want to be creative be creative smart ... not dumb

And the last thing ... make the hit or parry intervals wider ... in this game you miss a parry just because you don't hit parry in the same exact microsecond the opponent attacks ... HEY FUCKFACES ITS A FUCKING FUN GAME TO PLAY MAKE IT LIKE THAT YOU STRICT DUMB SHITS FOR NOTHING  


CONCLUSION
All in all becautiful Artwork & probably beautiful story ... i don't know ill never get to finish 
Unfortunately i played more than 2 hours and can't refund it now
Maybe in its 10 iteration like BALSPHEOMUS 10 will be great but this one just looks great but the gameplay is bulky remind me of not even the arcade games but like the very old 2d pc games

The world and lore is so immersive. Secrets are everywhere and so rewarding to uncover and fully explore zones. Story is very cool. Room for a lot of build diversity and approaches. Lots of side content and missions to complete.

platforming can be a little poor at times with controls that are slightly slow and unresponsive.

If slowly, methodically, and even a bit stressfully venturing through a wild, fallen world of Catholic themes and Gothic imagery appeals to you: go on. It will take a lot of time to master the timing and idiosyncrasies of the combat, lots of reading through lore and items; figuring out which prayers and upgrades to utilize for different chunks of the game.

Deaths to environmental hazards (bottomless pits, spike traps etc) could have been punished a little bit less?

Pros:
Style: Art, Music, and General atmosphere of this game is impeccable. Beautiful looking sprites that are so detailed its hard to think how much time, and creativity went into each animation and background. The music follows this, and is fantastic, from Spanish influenced instrumental pieces, to religious chants, to more ambient sounding tracks, the games music composer(s) did a really great job at painting a picture of a cruel, but whimsical world. 
Progression: Blasphemous does a fantastic job at making your progression feel earned. Facing down bosses, and reaching new areas is all part of the journey, expectations of a reward are common for this genre, but Blasphemous has a real nice way of giving meaning to those rewards. 
Environment/Setting: This category has to stand out from style in my opinion. Their is just something so right about the places you go in this game. A giant dirt embedded inverted bell, to beautiful snowy monasteries, to downright standard but pleasant looking villages. Setting is a core part of this game, and this game actually feels consistent in that compared to many other in its genre. 

Neutrals: 
Story: As a souls inspired metroidvania looking at this game for rich story is a misstep. It is serviceable to get the character to progress, but know what you are playing. 
Difficulty: It's pretty hard. Not back breakingly difficult, but it asks a lot of its players.

Cons:
Combat/Movement: This is a soft con, some people might like the way kinetics feels in this game, I didn't prefer it. It feels just as stiff as Super Castlevania. Maybe that's the point, the PC isn't some floaty little bugman bouncing around, he is a revenant but still it can be a chore to move and that never feels fun for players, no matter how justified it is in universe. 
Backtracking: This is a staple of metroidvanias, it typically sucks, but it makes sense to pad out gameplay. I can't blame it too much, the spritework and enemy death animations are a treat to watch over and over but backtracking really is one of the worst sins of the genre and this game is guilty of it as well.
 
Overall I give Blasphemous an 8/10. It's beautiful and deserves much love, and despite my problems with it, it absolutely pushes the genre forward in a good direction.

I love the artwork and atmosphere in this game and it is stunningly crafted. But I guess the budget went all into that and just a minor part into development itself.

Some gameplay mechanics, which are really stupid, just make the game harder for no reason. The character cannot walk while attacking for example. It is simply very annoying and it doesn't even make sense. Why would you do that?
Hitboxes of enemies are very unprecise, especially when dodging. Fighting while climbing is completely useless because your attack is also used to climb. Many little things that could have been done better so easily.
I also upgraded my potions to a better version and all of a sudden I have only 1 potion instead of 2. Explanation? Nope. I rather have my two 50% potions back instead of one 100% heal. I even had to farm and pay for that crappy ""upgrade"".
No effort on animations of the character which you look at all the time. Would have been a good idea to give some variability but I guess that's too innovative and fun.

Also technically the game is limited to 60FPS, Vsync is an absolute catastrophe and the game has microstuttering in some areas and in some it doesn't. The game ran smoother in 4k than it did in 1440p which makes absolutely no sense. You don't even see a difference with this kind of pixelart. No borderless fullscreen and the rendering options: LOL (adds big fat horizontal stripes to imitate old TV-screens but basically just cuts out 30% of the imagery. Worst stuff I have ever seen)

It's disappointing in gameplay and programming due to some annoying decisions that really put me off. 
The artwork is much better than the gameplay unfortunately, so I would not recommend buying it, even on sale.
If I was one of the artists I would be so angry at the devs! They messed up big time and dumped a lot of potential.

Props to the artists, shame on the developers.",1669861920,1669861920,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

TL;DR, clipping into the ground, getting softlocked, and some other things towards the 2nd half of the game make it apparent that a majority of this game wasn't playtested as much as it should have been. No player just experiencing your game should have to figure out themselves that if you press a controller button to activate the game at the title screen you no longer can ""press any button to continue"" on the death screen and instead must click your mouse/keyboard. LOL.

There's plenty of small problems I had with this game especially towards the end of it, and more specifically being a completionist. You can't 100% the game without NG+, so don't try. I got 99.11% completion doing *everything* the game could let me do on my first playthrough in 22hrs of running around painstakingly WITHOUT Google, and I don't think I care enough to even consider playing through a second time. I enjoyed the game, but why are you locking content behind NG+ again? I didn't enjoy the game enough to want to play the entire game again, especially because I'm the type of player that *has* to get every single item and tile of the map.

Good art, good sprites, good lore, good gameplay, atmospheric music. I really liked the Bloodstained cross-over and it's challenges, I enjoyed the little 8-bit Castlevania/Ghouls & Ghosts arcade game you could find. However, lots of small things added up towards the end that made me not want to play the game anymore than I had to, and that's not a good sign whatsoever.",1669847803,1669847803,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Blasphemous is probably one of the legendary games that I've ever played, it has a Dark Story which is really well written, the controls are smooth and crispy and killing the enemies by parrying them or killing them by giving brutal executions is really satisfying. I've played this game non-stop since the day I've bought it, already beat the game 2 times and still playing it. I rarely feel that I want to fully complete a game after beating it but in case of Blasphemous, I want to really 100% the achievements and stuff like that! Yes, The game is hard but after you learn the patterns of the boss and be patient, you'll get through the bosses, trust me! I really hate hard games since I know I can't finish them but here, I completed it two times, like I said before. I can't wait for the sequel of the game because the developers of this game are really creative! The sprites of the enemies and bosses is so perfectly made, But the guy who made it needs psychological help lol. The Music in this game is also really well made, The Patio of The Silent Steps area's soundtrack really made me feel kind of weird and disturbed? It was a weird feeling... That's all I am gonna say which explains that this game is an absolute gem of a game, I bought the game when it was on sale but I can say that Blasphemous is worth the full price!

The Catholic-Gothic setting is awe-inspiring while shockingly grotesque and hauntingly beautiful. I feared this game would be a 1-dimensional gore-fest with chip-tunes metal, but this couldn't be further from the fact. The score, which includes classical Spanish guitar and piano pieces, is perfectly measured. The retro, low-res art style perfectly fits the subject and transported me to a place of joy from my childhood. 

The game does have detractors too. The most significant, I found, was the quality of the voice-acting. At least, until I changed the language to the original Spanish with English subtitles. This is a Spanish game and the Spanish voice-acting is great - play it no other way!

The story can be hard to follow at times, with a lack of quest information in the inventory screen, having me resort to online guides. The game's world is not as expansive as Hollow Knight, yet there is a lot to remember and understand. I did become lost in the Gothic technobabble, some of which is story-critical. The overall plot is fairly simple but filled with complicated, interesting ideas.

The platforming mechanics are good, but not seamless. The main flaw is that there’s no dedicated grab action, leading to much frustration with ladders and ledges, especially in the vicinity of enemies. The game was clearly designed to be played with a d-pad controller. I would have appreciated proper support for an analogue stick. These are fairly minor issues, though.

The player's casting and recovery times can be much longer than enemies' random attack cycles, leading to much frustration when you cannot respond quickly enough. Some of the controls would lead to a frustrating cascade of incorrectly executed moves. It's more fun if you can be nimble and react quickly without feeling like you're fighting the controller.

Personally, I was a disappointed that the game doesn’t let itself become properly blasphemous, avoiding all mention of Jesus, God the Father and Catholicism. The setting is a fantasy world, but I think the setting would be far more interesting as a biblical Apocrypha. It would have been an interesting push-of-the-envelope and a small joke on the Satanic Panic of the 80s and 90s.

Blasphemous is a pretty good game, if only you know what to expect, or if you don't expect anything at all. Still, there's quite a few problems that detract from the experience that I feel should be addressed:

-For a game that focuses so much on platforming, there's not much imagination to it. I get what they were going for and I had fun with it, but the only thing that changes from area to area is a new unique-looking hazard that does essentially the same thing as the last, and how much it can screw your game by either just damaging you or throwing you into insta-death pits/spikes. Other than that, it's jumping and ledge-grabbing your way through the game. Because of this, I get why people were underwhelmed by this aspect of the game.

-Unbalanced difficulty. Early game is pretty easy, even too much so, then there's a sudden difficulty spike mid-game in both combat and platforming, but soon you can become so overpowered that both combat and bosses become harmless. Anyone going for the true ending in the late game will be disappointed by how easy it is to attain it.

-Some really terrible bosses. I don't know who had the idea for Expósito, but as much as that giant baby creeped the hell out of me, it just wasn't a fun nor very challenging boss.

-The story. The game throws a lot of information at you through cryptic dialogues and a huge amount of collectables with 'lore' attached to them, but frankly, it never gives us any reason to care about any of it. There were only a few moments where I felt interested in what was going on in the story and even fewer with the lore items.

-The voice acting. I know it was supposed to sound like this, but that kinda makes it worse. Jocinero and Crisanta were probably the worst offenders for me.

-The world design makes no sense. This is a nitpick, I get it's hard to make a game that's spatially sensible without sacrificing gameplay, but an elevator that goes down from a mountain cavern to a village that has a clear vision of the open sky is forcing my suspension of disbelief.

I know it sounds like I hated the game, but I genuinely liked it. I just don't think it survived the hype, but since I wasn't really sure what to expect, it was all a nice surprise for me.

If you enjoy Castlevania-esque games then Blasphemous should immediately jump out to you as a game to check out. It has fairly simplistic combat that still has a good challenge to it. The lore and story of this game are phenomenal if you enjoy a medieval biblical gothic aesthetic. Every fine detail of the writing helps set a tone that is completely unique to this game. Every character design in this game has so much thought and detail put into it that I would recommend getting the art book just to see the concepts. The bosses are challenging and sometimes quite frustrating but are unique from one another and provide unique challenges whilst still playing into the set combat rules of the game. I have not played any of the penance runs yet because I'm afraid it will be simply too hard for me but the option is always there for players that think that the game was just too easy.

I feel like steam would benefit from a more robust review system, as I feel like this game is in-between a 7-8 out of ten rather than a ten out ten. There are a lot of really good things going for this game, the visuals are strong, the atmosphere is really incredible, and the movement/combat system on the players end is really fun to play. The enemies are varied not only in appearance, but also how they attack and operate, and the same could be said for the bosses as well.

For the negatives, I feel like the pacing and balance are a bit off in this game. The game is setup so that you need to beat 3 areas to progress, but it seems like no matter how you tackle the areas, the last one is guaranteed to be way less of a challenge than the other ones due to you the character being a little bit too overleveled. Some attacks that you have are questionable, the slide attack that you unlock later seems a tad bit overpowered. It does a ton of damage and is relatively easy to pull off, which allows you to melt through bosses that are stuck to the ground. The mana system that you have seems to be a little bit underdeveloped, and I rarely if ever used it since it never seemed to do that much damage. 
I also thought that the optional timed platforming gauntlets were kinda crap .
my final criticism is on the final boss: [spoiler] The final boss felt like the game ended on a slightly sour note. The main problems were that sometimes the platforms more often than not made it impossible to damage the boss, the sword often would go offscreen for 5+ seconds which feels like a slight bug, and also unskipable cutscenes (which is a criticism that I could levy against a lot of other bosses) made the fight a little bit frustrating [/spoiler]

Overall, I think it's a great game that's held back a tiny bit by some small issues. I would recommend this too most people who are into this kinda genre, and I think it's a slight shame that this game doesn't have a huge audience behind it, as I think that this game has a ton going for it.",1668923539,1668923683,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

That said, I like my challenges more like hollow knight, and less like the first demon souls. I loved how it felt to control your character in hollow knight, and while the game absolutely kicked my butt it I never felt like I took a hit because of unresponsive controls, or clunky feeling interface. I always knew it was my fault, and figured I had to get better.
Demon Souls felt challenging, but not in a good way. Like the difficulty was largely dependent on incredibly deliberate and often incredibly clunky controls. It was fine for its time, but there's no excuse for that nowadays.

This feels more like you're controlling a derpy, slow, mannequin trundling along. While the controls themselves are responsive enough, you have to be very deliberate, but at the same time you have to be very reactive. It's like this game straddles somewhere between wanting the fluidity of hollow knight, but wanting to feel deliberate like the first demon souls. All in all, it makes the game largely a chore for me.

While I understand that a lot of people love that, I find that the most charitable review I can leave is that it's lackluster at best. 

Pros:
Looks decent. 
Enemy design is good.

Cons:
No skipping pre-boss cut scenes. 
REALLY clunky controls.

The game takes place in your typical unwelcoming brash world, this time with strong themes of sin, punishment, pain, and the likes. Its early game is structured much like the first Dark Souls, with you having the complete specific objectives in any order to open the path to a major area.

These first 3 objectives were off to a pretty good start, save for one that was (in my experience) significantly harder to find than the others. Speaking of difficult to find, this game's progression can vary from steadily straightforward to cryptically unreasonable. I found myself fearing what I would get stuck at next once I started progressing after hours of figuring out where to go. I believe this was partially due to the sheer confusion induced by speech in this game. While I'm already used to Souls games having remarkably more complicated and vague dialog, this game exceeded my expectations. Almost all of the dialog in this game felt like reading an actual bible passage, which, while charming, really did not help with understanding the story or what i was supposed to do next. It gets even worse once you finish the 3 objectives, as you get at most 12 lines of dialog, those being only lore dumps and no direction whatsoever.

I'd say the game falls off the most progression wise during the halfway/end game point, as there's a specific puzzle where you need 3 masks to progressively go higher in an elevator, and the first two are very well placed and feel like you're progressing while finding them. but for some god forsaken reason the last one of them is so incredibly far away from the other two that it makes the puzzle incredibly frustrating, and made me resort to looking up what to do after 4 hours of searching, which i hate.

Atmosphere wise, that's one of the places where this game shines the most. The pixel art in this game has such an insane amount of detail that makes you feel truly immersed. Much of the imagery in this game is inspired by Spanish Christianity, and the religious imagery in this game really captures the idea of some sort of twisted divine punishment. Not to mention, the music perfectly blends with the style, having this melancholic desolate sound to it. The areas in the game are also quite varied, going from snow mountains up above to toxic sewers down below, though a few underground areas do look rather similar.

Combat wise, it's hard to judge the quality. Sliding felt painfully inconsistent with larger bosses and a few melee bosses, and i found myself many times sliding through attacks that many other times managed to damage me when i slid with almost the same timing. The hitboxes are also quite questionable, with many times me being hit while jumping over a spinning enemy and getting hit while clearly not being even close to being in contact with them, and somehow, the bad hitboxes were also beneficial, with attacks phasing through me while i healed for some unexplainable reason. But when the combat works, it really does shine. Learning parry windows can lead to a very fluid experience with some bosses, and slicing through them feels as impactful as you'd expect. There's also the option for magic attacks, which i didn't use quite often, but it helps add more variety to the combat from the few times i tried. There are also brutally delightful finishers you can perform when you damage an enemy enough, which were always a joy to watch every time.

Speaking of bosses, they were also rather inconsistent. I found most bosses where you had to either wait for them to expose themselves after dodging a flurry of attacks / hit them until they're exposed to be the most boring and frustrating, and there were a few beast bosses that felt impossible to parry or dodge through, and ended up feeling like a dps race. On the other hand, there are some remarkably good bosses, 2 of my favorites being near the end of the game. This game does one-on-one duels very well, and you both feel like equals. What you can't say about this game is that the bosses don't have variety, as all of them have a specific twist or gimmick that would keep me on my toes as i never knew what to expect.

Personally, i would say this game had a few minor highs, and some major lows, especially exploration wise. but i can absolutely see the passion and care put into this game, and im sure they'll expand on it once the sequel comes out. The word that best describes this game is [b] Potential. [/b]

I could not have imagined what an intelligent game awaited though, from its excellent gameplay and phenomenal art direction, to the genius, searing critique of Catholicism which the plot levies. Anyone who was raised Catholic should play this game. It does not level a weak critique of God isn't real the church is corrupt etc. which we are used to from video games, but rather, it builds a laser-focused, idiosyncratic critique of Catholicism which anyone raised Catholic would understand. The game, developed by Spaniards, is interwoven with Spanish and Catholic culture in a way that allows it to express a certain grievance and angst which anyone who was ever dissatisfied by the Catholic Church will understand at once.

Intellectual in its takedown, Blasphemous focuses on critiquing the concept of ""God's plan"", and the guilt complex of Catholicism in a way which is cathartic to anyone who has ever doubted, as well as those who are still believers. In a manner which is neither hateful nor caricaturing, Blasphemous dissects these issues until the plot and the gameplay itself arrives at the final conclusion, the titular Blasphemy is the recognition that there doesn't need to be a Plan, that the arbitrary rules of the Church can be rejected, and that that is okay.

(This review contains minor spoilers in regards to game mechanics)


Now, I'm fine with more slow-paced movement and combat systems that require more of a wait-and-strike approach than expecting you to quickly zig-zag around - but the one in this game isn't slow, it's outright clunky and bug-laden.
Sliding over ladders, auto-clinging to edges that works best when you don't need or want it to (especially in combat situations), a dodge and block/parry system that sometimes eats your inputs (furthermore, some enemies seem to hit you through a ""successful"" blocking animation by the very same attack that was supposed to be blocked).
Add to that the occasional rather game-breaking bug (like being trapped in an ""enemy arena"" room with an invincible enemy getting stuck in the floor on repeated tries, each time forcing you to die and respawn; or retrieval ""gravestones"" - the thingies that appear after dying - being generated in spike floors, essentially locking down part of your fervor/""energy"" bar semi-permanently).

The boss fights on the other hand look like the game doesn't quite know what it's up to.
During most of them the attack patterns fit the player's movement really well, I genuinely enjoyed those; but in others attack signaling is too short to react with the input delay, homing projectile attacks sometimes mingle with subsequent moves by dispersing after a seemingly random amount of time (making one of those impossible to avoid since you can only choose between blocking or movement/jumping)... generally playing like they were built for a game with a more fluid movement system (see ""quickly zig-zag around"").
Getting sufficiently unlucky with a boss's move selection can lead to a failed attempt on its own - which doesn't prevent you from beating the boss eventually with a more lucky try, but it made it unnecessarily frustrating for me and significantly reduced the feeling of success once I was done (there's no accomplishment in getting lucky).


But doesn't the mix of said flaws fit Blasphemous's overall theme? Well, yeah, it does - but at least for me, what makes metroidvanias fun and worth playing is [i] challenging [/i] gameplay, not being [i] punished [/i] by clunkyness, bugs and other random aspects. And it makes me sad, because the game feels like it could've been way more than it turned out to be, with proper polish (especially after multiple years of, essentially, post-release community ""testing"").",1668294531,1668294531,False,7,2,0.538196861743927002,0,True,False,False

Many things in the game are not explained properly and its all mashed up saying some words it might be just me who doesn't like this hefty talking that you don't understand a word.

Combat: 
Combat wise has some flaws it gets a janky sometimes and its slow in a tedious way, the doge/dash is not flued and it dose not feel good to use it feels something that is forced to the player, the dash dose not work always it works on some enemy's and it doesn't on other's.

Traversing:
 The back tracking gets tedious but it could be solved, for example hollow knight which you can travel at an okay speed by dashing plus you have a lot of fast travels for every biome which they all sync together but in Blasphemous the movement speed is not enough for this scale of a map, maybe an smaller map could've solved this problem, although it gives you the ability to travel between save points but its after like 5 hours in the game.

Visual:
 gotta say the 16 bit aesthetic is perfect with every enemy you encounter has a unique and detailed model and the environment of every biome is greatly detailed too, plus the voice acting fits perfect so the combination of these made a great atmosphere, one of the best pixel art styles that I've seen.

Story:
 the story is good with a  mid evil setting about religious. if your those stuff you'll have a good time listening to the npc's cuz the voice acting fits the setting perfectly but, the game doesn't explain many story related thing and (as i said before) when it dose you won't understand a fucking word of it cuz it's monotonous. 

Rewards and Items:
Well just like any souls like you kill enemy's and gain currency but, with the currency you ether buy skills or item's. most of the items you find are USELESS AS FUCK, there are buncha lore which they too are written monotonously and the other items are utilizable.

The only advantage: the art of some scenes is really eye-catching.

A whole bunch of disadvantages:

The traces of deliberate torture are too obvious, and other games will at most let you get stuck, jumping/chopping/solving puzzles over and over again. The biggest feature of this game is that a considerable part of the difficulty lies in the platform jumping; Make a mistake once, die on the spot, and possibly start again from a distant rebirth point;

Traps are a one-hit for players, and the game production team has designed traps in front of almost every seemingly important item;

The character operation is too stiff and weird, and the climbing judgment is also very strange, resulting in the inability to dodge the difficulties of various maps, many times you see that the character's feet have been significantly higher than the floor of the scene but just can't go up, go to the edge of the floor The character will automatically hang on the edge, in this case, the game production team actually did a lot of map traps, very disappointed, I really feel that the game production team did this to deliberately extend the player's play time;

If you don't donate 20,000 to the church and you're going somewhere, there's a good chance you'll have to walk for minutes to get there after leaving the teleportation point, and don't forget the character operation I just mentioned, you may have to spend more time.

This game has linkage content with Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night, but this linkage content has no combat content, its content is actually platform jumping, as I said before, the character operation is too stiff and weird, and the climbing judgment is also very strange, it actually uses platform jumping as the content, with the game production team designed the trap and strange map design that will die at the first contact, you will find that the game production team is a group of psychopaths.

Try your best to torture you, and the few items that you have painstakingly obtained are useless, the battle has an upper limit and no lower limit, 35 hours completely do not appreciate what this game has to play, what is interesting, what excites you, blindly imitating the difficulty of DARK SOULS but not learning the rich combat system of others, this game is full of malice, difficult for the sake of difficulty, disgusting your valleys and spikes everywhere and the terrain that will die if you make a mistake, The damage received by the character when colliding with the enemy is equivalent to receiving complete damage, the miscellaneous soldiers who will hide after a fight are still fucking high in health and take multiple attacks, and skills that are unnecessary but cost a lot of fucking money to buy, and skill upgrades are also monotonous and tedious.",1668186028,1668186028,False,2,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

The Pixel Art of Blasphemous is beautiful, the world and story the devs have created is quite interesting. Unfortunately the mechanics feel like any other Metroidvania. The dodge, ledge Grand and ladder climbing is all a bit fickle and can sometimes be awkward. I also wish there was some sort of intro skip for bosses, its quite tedious and boring having to spam a button to go through the same bosses paragraph of dialogue over and over, it makes me feel like the true boss is carpal tunnel.

The World is big and there is a lot to explore but there is a lot of platforming and with the current control scheme it can be a pain. By the end I found myself mostly avoiding enemies since they're no longer a threat and is a waste of time.

If you're not a completionist and just want to play, you'll have a great time.  If you try to max out stats, get 100% map cleared, or in general like to do the things the game tells you to, you'll have to look things up.

Blasphemous is a game I wish I could love more.  I -want- to love it more.  If you could know one thing going in, it's this: don't be ashamed to look things up.  The game is just too cryptic to stand on its own without using internet help.  Once you do, however, the game changes into a series of challenges to complete, rather than one whole picture.

All this said, the game is beautiful- the art, the music, the bosses, the environments.  Everything.  The game should be played just to witness it all.  There's a LOT of backtracking, but it's not as bad because the areas are so often so marvelous to look at and listen to while traveling through the game.

However, you'll also see many paths you'll simply miss.  Basic upgrades and basic items are locked behind several series of chains of quests you can easily miss.  If you play the game blind, you will likely never reach max level on your weapon, health, fervor... ANYthing.  You probably won't even see half of the map, because you won't know how to get key mobility items.  To make matters worse, a lot of key items that are necessary upgrades have to be swapped out on the fly.  I don't know why they thought limiting the player to swapping out these key items would be ""fun"" or ""challenging.""  It becomes tedious quickly in the late game.

The game is a Metroidvania, but its difficulty comes from how cryptic it is.  Rather than combat being unfair, it's almost too easy, meanwhile the difficulty of the game boils down to the fact that you'll never get stronger or discover half of what the game has to offer without looking everything up.  If you have to use a guide for 50% of the game, it's just not as fun.

I do recommend the game, but know that most of the game will be hidden to you without guides.  This isn't like Dark Souls or Sekiro; Blasphemous is the most esoteric game I've played, where the core concepts of the game get muddled by trying to make it too many things and letting the ""puzzle"" aspect detract from the experience if you're a completionist.",1667859082,1667859082,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First and foremost, there is an issue wherein you can 'ruin' your save file and lock yourself out of the proper ending 95%+ of the way through the game. This occurs without warning, explanation, or (most importantly) confirmation. You still have and can continue to collect the quest items related to the proper ending, but the relevant NPC simply stops talking to you, leaving you wondering if you're missing something.

Secondly, there are some problematic rough edges with the controls and combat mechanics. Many of them are somewhat minor on their own. 
For one example, when you push down to go from standing to crouch, there's a transition animation that plays for a few frames during which you arbitrarily can't swing your weapon. If you tap the attack button during this time the input is just dropped. 
As a second example, the mantling and platform mechanics are a bit sloppy (which, for a side scrolling platformer, is pretty alarming!). You can only mantle if you contact the edge of a platform at about head height, but jumping won't land you on a platform unless your feet are completely above its plane (there is no 'step height' affordance at all). This means you can jump high enough to be too high to latch onto the mantle, but too low to land on the platform, so you just sort of go through the platform and miss the jump. 

There are roughly a couple dozen of these kinds of design issues / bugs / control ambiguities that intrude into the play experience, muddying it and distracting from the proper souls-like core of an execution challenge that demands from the player thoughtful, precise control inputs and reactions.",1667695410,1667695410,False,3,0,0.503882467746734619,0,True,False,False

The places you need to visit for necessary progression are incredibly easy to miss; they are often, in fact, hidden at the edge of the map in rooms identical to lore and ""inconsequential unsellable item pickup"" rooms. Following a guide is a must, especially because there is no distinction between what is vague flavour text and actual information. Places give no indication when they have been changed by your actions, even when you are within those places at that time; you will often find yourself needing to leave and return to a room in order to refresh it (which would not bee too much of a problem if you, say, moved faster and *were given any clue that you needed to reload the area or that the area had changed at all.* This game suffers from a plethora of bad design choices from the combat to the terrible and omnipresent platforming to that *wind direction is a central mechanic in a certain platforming zone, a la Celeste, but unlike Celeste it is nearly impossible to see it*. Thus, I am saddened to say that while I desperately wanted to love this game, I could not find it in me to keep needlessly frustrating myself with the instant-death pits and attack, wait-for-parry, attack, wait-for-parry...

Everything is colorful and emotional; it's a wonder that 18th century Spanish artwork hasn't been plumbed for more content in video games. Do yourself a favor and listen to the Spanish dub, as it's much more pleasing to the ears than the English one.

Take that away though and [i]Blasphemous[/i] really doesn't have anything else going for it. I found most of the upgrades pointless (I can count on one hand the amount of times I used a Prayer powerup and you get, like, ten of them); the [i]Mea Culpa[/i] standard sword attacks are the most effective use of your weapon as upgrades are subpar and the ranged attack is functionally worthless; it's entirely possible to complete the game without using the advanced movement powerups (these aren't even that special anyway as they are only needed to avoid certain traps to grab pickups; there is nothing on par with a super run from [i]Super Metroid[/i] or any type of item to help you get around quicker); there are long stretches of terrain that are in desperate need of more warp points to avoid lengthy backtracking.

Movement as a whole is irksome: I found the dodge mechanic to be incredibly inconsistent, and with how long you're stunned-locked when hit you'll often find yourself hit two or three times more because you can't jump or dodge out of it when you have multiple enemies or attacks converging on you. There's a great deal of clunkiness felt in jumping, especially from ladders or when attached to walls. I often found that the Penitent One just wouldn't grab onto ladders consistently when he had to jump to them, or the momentum would be halted when attempting to jump from a wall he was attached to.

I don't want to say a lot because I have so much respect for this game. One thing I will say is there are 3 endings to this game (there were 2 originally, however the devs at Blasphemous were very kind to drop a free dlc which will unfortunately probably be the last content added to this game) and I haven't even beat ending C which most players would consider the true and canon ending.

It all starts out very solid but after the first few areas I started running into both really obnoxious intended things, like doorways that spit you out a pixel away from falling into a death hole to kill you if you forget to stop holding forward during the room transition, and somehow slightly less obnoxious unintended things, like lingering or disjointed hitboxes on enemies. I had one instance of what I think was an enemies contact damage hitbox completely detaching from them when I panned the camera to make them offscreen, causing me to continuously get hit every second or so with no visible enemies or attacks anywhere on screen until I panned the camera back over to where the enemy was and killed them. There's an area with some electric orb traps where the traps cause damage long before and after the visual for their activation is present making passing by them safely basically impossible. There was another area where in one room the camera just started going crazy like there was an earthquake going on even though every room around it was fine and nothing in that room made it seem like that should have been happening. That same area has enemies who shoot bouncing projectiles except sometimes their projectiles would just skip straight to their despawning animation the instant they were fired for no discernable reason. It's baffling just how many weird bugs like these I was running into in the second half of the game considering how well polished the first half had been.

Going back to intended things I don't like, there's a whole lot of waiting built into the game. Desynchronized platforms that force you to wait for their movement to line up for you to proceed, slow elevators operated by slow levers that need to be operated many times in a short period, enemies that will guaranteed trade hits with you unless you wait to parry them or that disappear or run away to force you to wait for them to be reachable. Almost every boss has a sizeable amount of that last kind of forced waiting while they run away or wind up something you need to parry, if you're generous you could say it's to give you time to use the lengthy healing move but some of the bosses force waits after every single one of their attacks, the game is generally on the harder side so I think I'd be fine with a few less healing opportunities making it a little bit harder if it meant less waiting when you're playing well. 

The second half of the game has a lot of fights that lean very heavily into projectile spam in ways that really aren't enjoyable to deal with considering how the player character controls. Your movement is pretty limited with a fairly slow walking and jumping speed and a very rigid feeling dodge that has very little invincibility if any at all and yet some of the projectile spam feels like it's designed around a much faster character with a much stronger dodge move. There are a lot of bosses who feel very fair and fun in their first phases who in phase two just start spraying semi-random projectiles on top of their previously fair moves and you end up in situations where avoiding a move from the boss would force you into a projectile which would juggle you back into the bosses followup attack into another projectile and then one hit that felt out of your control ends up taking away almost all of your health. There's a particularly egregious example of this right at the halfway point of the game with a boss who already has some awkward projectile spam in the first phase who summons a second enemy to spam pseudo-projectile moves in phase two, who then comes back three more times as a miniboss with a mostly unchanged moveset and random basic enemies thrown in on the side.

If the game had either just the intended stuff I don't like or just the bugs I think I'd give it a thumbs up, or maybe even if they were both spread out throughout the whole thing, but the fact that I got four or five hours into it and was starting to think it was going to all be great and then ran into an endless parade of both buggy and obnoxiously designed encounters makes it a thumbs down.",1667359290,1667359290,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

GOOD:
- I love the ""corrupted Catholic"" aesthetic, and the world-building work was excellent. At least one boss is connected to a real-world historical figure, and not one you would have ever heard of (maybe if you're Spanish?) A lot of the background art is also based on real-world objects and locations. The designers did their homework.
- Enemy and boss art is very good, with fluid and expressive animations.
- Good boss fights in general. I especially liked the Exhumed Archbishop fight.
- The Rosary Beads system is well-developed.

BAD:
- Enemy variety could have been better. Many late-game enemies are just early-game enemies with new sprites and more hit points. In some cases, the enemy's behavior changes, but the strategy for defeating them doesn't. This is especially bad in Mother of Mothers, which doesn't have a single enemy you hadn't encountered in some form before.
- I'm not a fan of the music for the areas. (The only exception is in Mother of Mothers, where the music fits very well with the area theme.)
- There's only one place where it's ever necessary to take off two of the early Relics (Blood Perpetuated in Sand and Three Gnarled Tongues). You can equip up to three Relics, and you often need those two in combination, but except for this one place you never need a combination of any of the other Relics. I'm somewhat confused about why these are even Relics, as opposed to permanent abilities, and it points to an oversight in the Relic system or the level design.
- I unlocked the whole Mea Culpa skill tree, but found no use for some of the abilities. You could beat the game without using any of them, which seems... off? That's a legitimate design decision, sure - you can beat Hollow Knight without ever using a Nail Art, for instance. But Blasphemous puts so much emphasis on combat that not finding ways to get the player to use the Mea Culpa skills feels like a missed opportunity.",1667082801,1667336475,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game can get hard, yes, but is almost never patience testing or downright unfair, save for one boss or one (optional) platforming section. It has the environmental and item description-told lore of Dark Souls, the exploration and secrets of a Metroid game, and the platforming and combat of most Metroidvanias you can find out there, with possibly a bit more depth to it with regards to equippable charms/runes and ""prayers"", AKA abilities (think Hollow Knight). 

The best thing going for this game by far it its art style and atmosphere, which is apparent right out of the gate with the first cutscene, and the gameplay is enjoyable and tight enough to where it can supplement the 15-20 hours you'll spend beating it the first time around. The bosses are unique enough and challenging enough to keep you for a bit, but not annoyingly long amounts of time, which I can appreciate, but some might find it too easy for their tastes. I personally did not. Story wise, that's up to how much you care to look into it, though if you do it's interesting enough although not super unique.

The music is nothing I would personally write home about, it's your typical dark fantasy affair, though some songs do stand out among others, if only just by a little.

The thing that sucks the most and that I find annoying is that some quests and DLC content is event-gated, as in if you do some specific things (which are not warned about prior) before trying to do those quests/DLC, you'll be locked out of it until your next run. That is just plain stupid. Be sure to look at the wiki or on forums for what to temporarily avoid before doing that content.

TLDR: Amazing art style and fluid pixel animations, solid Metroidvania-Soulslike combat and platforming, semi-difficult and unique bosses, serviceable soundtrack, and some annoying gates regarding specific quests and DLC content. I would recommend giving it a shot if you're into games like these, or at the very least wait for a sale.",1666665783,1666665783,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The art and the soundtrack are absolutely amazing and give character to this game and make the world feel alive. The pixel art is also great and some scenes are absolutely stunning. When it comes to the enemies and their designs they are all great, all of the bosses look amazing and are challenging in their own way. I suggest you leave the DLC bosses for the end since they are the most challenging in the game and probably the most fun. Bugs are pretty much nonexistant and I have encountered 1 through all 3 of my playthroughs and even that was easily dealt with. New game plus is pretty neat as it gives us a way to make the game even more challenging. The story, maybe a bit confusing at times, is also great and the lore is very rich. Keep in mind that the game doesn't explain ANYTHING to you so you'll have to figure out everything yourself, that's why I recommend you use the wiki for some quests or puzzles (especially when it comes to getting all the endings, there are a total of 3 of them). The only complaint I have is the amount of enemy health in the new game plus, some basic enemies are harder to beat than some bosses which just doesn't make sense. The prayers could also do some work since some of them are borderline useless or aren't worth their fervour cost and I only used 3 in my entire playthrough.

I would say that describing this game as a ""souls-like"" is not really true to it's nature.
Even though it is obvious that the gameplay and some elements were heavily inspired by Dark Souls, for me the religious context and theme of the game as a whole are approached a lot better here.

In Dark Souls I often felt like the designers did not really understand the objects they were trying to capture - the gothic architecture, the style and culture of medieval Europe. 
It was as though they were explorers in an uncharted land, making drawing of things they encountered along the way.
Really beautiful and complex drawings, sure, but with little deeper meaning.

In Blasphemous, the context of religion is approached on a more cynical, but still very mature level.
There are no jokes, but I often felt that the absurdity of some situations was so sad, that it felt almost humorous.

As a person who was raised in a very religious country, Blasphemous spoke to me a lot louder and clearer than Dark Souls or Elden Ring ever did.

I'll use dark souls as a comparison for ease of explanation, since people should be largely familiar with that franchise and its mechanics. 

1. How is it similar to Dark Souls?
You have shrines that act like bonfires, which save your progression, refill your flasks and reset enemies. 
You collect ""Tears of atonement"" (souls) to upgrade your moveset, your flasks and to buy items. 
Upon death you don't lose your souls but you leave behind 'regret' which limits your ""fervor"" (mana) bar and how much you gain. You can have your 'regret' forgiven at certain points instead of retrieving it where you died.
You have a dodge button (roll) but rather than make you invincible you need to time it to pass through enemies and their attacks. You have a parry button which only works on light attacks.
The game has literal traps and inconveniently placed enemies that will either knock back your progression or push you off an edge to your death. 
Enemies attack in inconvenient ways that are timed to be inopportune as often as possible.
The game is vague in what things do/where you do them and choices have consequences that are not obvious.
You interact with NPC's multiple times in order to give them things (or not) which causes things to happen (or not). 

2. How does it differ from Dark Souls, mechanically?
Your progression regarding what you buy with the souls equivalent currency is nowhere as complex or openended. 
There are no classes and no meaningful choices, what you buy are minor upgrades and move unlocks.
You can buy beads for exorbitant prices that give you minor resistances or you can unlock moves that are hard to use or not that useful/powerful. 

Two examples: 
Plunge Attack - Fairly straightforward, you attack downwards while falling. While the game tells you what to do, it doesn't explain how to do it. Rather than just pressing down and attack while falling, you have to wait until you are at your zenith and then hold both buttons down and it only works when  you've fallen a certain distances. This is not a ""hard to use"" attack as much as it's a frustratingly useless one.
Charge-up attack: Stand still and hold down the attack button until you've gone through two visual queues to unleash an attack that's as good as just attacking twice. While it's not useless, it's only useful against predictable enemies that walk towards you. Anything quicker and you'll be hit before you do your attack. 

While not all moves are as bad, they don't feel useful and they're all clunky to use. 

3. What's wrong with it, why am I not recommending it?
It's not a fun game and it's challenging in the sense that you don't need to just do the right thing, but you need to do it pixel perfect, hampered by how the game plays. 

While it's not terrible, there are some quality issues and poor design, such as having to be in the near exact center of a ladder to grab it in midair. If this is intended, it's a built in annoyance meant to screw over the player for no other reason than the developer going ""because I said so"".

Enemies have too much health/take too many hits. A consistent theme throughout is that you need to avoid things repeatedly, which is not a challenge as much as it's just having players jumping through hoops until they fail. 

You have to have your vocabulary on point and know a large array of religious terms and words for objects in order to understand their significance. 
A lot of what you actually have to do is very vague, as are descriptions of items and what they do or what you do with them. 

Having to go outside the game to understand is rarely a good thing, yet it's increasingly necessary with games like this one.

After three hours of this, I gave up and just used a trainer to fix the damage I took in unfair places, which makes the game bearable. At this point I just want to see what happens and couldn't care less about playing it on the developer's premises. It's one thing to play hard games, it's another when it's all about restricting what the player does and hmapering them in unfair ways repeatedly for a miserable experience that leaves you wondering why you bothered in the first place, once you beat the current challenge.

One could fairly accuse that the game just isn't for me, but reality is that if it had half the BS design I'd be plenty happy with it and have an enjoyable experience, but this is way too much, especially when I've already gone through similar games like Hollow Knight, Dark Souls and so on. It's gotten tedious and the mechanics mimicked in 'Blasphemous' are used poorly.

----------

Update:

I've now beaten the game with a nearly 100% (I'm locked out of one part due to an item being unequippable). I've gone on and off of using cheats and I still find it intolerably poorly tuned.
There are a few bugs that are horrible, the worst one being that you will lose your ability to dodge and move in the air. You fix it by exiting the area, but I got this bug during a long boss fight and thought it was a part of it.

There are parkour parts to the game towards the end ala the white palace in Hollow Knight.
These are exceptionally poorly tuned and several factors will work against you, out of your control, such as fireballs sometimes staggering you and sometimes not, ladders not being hung on to, platforms that you land on and then fall through, ledges that your character arbitrarily will or won't grab on to, lamps that will shoot away from you that you need to sword jump on and many other issues.

You can still beat these parts, but they are not fun to play and you are unlikely to feel accomplished doing them, I certainly did not. 

I can't recommend this game in good faith, it's just not a good comprehensive experience, it's far too set on being frustrating for frustration's sake. There's a difference between learning how to play a game and then trial and error gameplay where you'll have to go through a set of 'I wanna be the guy, gaiden' annoyances until you get the sequence right and reach the next checkpoint.

The fact that anyone will defend this on the developer's behalf speaks volumes of the low quality gameplay that people are used to.

Both the platforming and the gameplay generally feel good. Movement is simple but precise, and while the required platform isn’t too punishing, getting optional items can often be very challenging. Combat requires good timing to dodge and attack, but also rewards players for utilizing the more challenging parry mechanic.

The pixel art is extremely detailed and the animations are often quite complex. The designs of enemies and the world are steeped in the darkest parts of Catholicism, including a great deal of torture and self-flagellation, complete with the blood and gore that accompanies that. It’s not for the faint of heart or the squeamish.

My biggest problem with the game lies in the signposting for the sidequests. While the main quest is easy to follow, the sidequests required for the true ending often require some convoluted leaps of logic or sequencing that most wouldn’t reach without a guide.

If you are a part of the niche that enjoys the aesthetic and challenge of the game, I’d highly recommend picking it up. It delivers on what it promises.

+ Awesome 16-bit visuals that lend themselves perfectly to the classic metroidvania genre.

+ Eerie, religion-based horrors pervade the world and its many characters; a beautiful mix of Catholic themes/icons and Spanish Gothic aesthetics. Each character faces their own trials in the form of punishment or penance for their sins; as the Penitent One, you can choose to help these characters be rid of their sins (in exchange for rewards) or ignore them completely. The world building is fantastically done through interacting with these characters and is optional in most cases for those without the time or patience.

+ The game puts equal emphasis on combat, platforming, and exploration, all of which are really fleshed out and can be developed upon with mechanical skill and a bit of creativity. The various items, equipment, passives, and powers you find throughout your journey can/will help you in the other aspects of the game.

+ Plenty of enemy variation and unique bosses keep the game challenging and fresh; there's never a dull moment. For those that like a good platforming section, there are even timed jumping puzzles tied to a side quest that offer a nice change of pace.

+ Map design is well-done with varied regions, each with their own environmental challenges and themes. Furthermore, there are many points of added interconnectivity hidden away that allow for easier/faster traversal, as well as a balanced fast travel system.

+ The game offers NG+, as well as a boss rush mode, to add some replayability.

+ The soundtrack helps sell the religious tones with scores consisting of angelic choirs, booming organs, and tingling chimes mixed with lovely strings clearly influenced by Spanish tones.

+ You can pet the dog.


[h1]Negatives[/h1]
- Since you are able to pause and change prayers (powers) mid-combat, it would be nice to instead have a menu to cycle between a subset of pre-selected prayers to eliminate some pausing. The combat would keep flowing, and the player could feel more inclined to switch between prayers to suit their needs.

- Occasionally, ladders can be finicky; either you will get stuck on one mid-combat when trying to attack upwards or you will seemingly miss the ladder completely and fall to your death when trying to jump to it. It's not a huge problem, but it happened enough to be a point of frustration in certain sections of the game.

This however is build upon metroidvenia structure, mobility and abilities to travers the world is a hall mark of such games. In Blasphemous abilites to travers the world is easily missable, since it is not obtained through following the story.

There certainly are some anoying enemies, some of them do chain attacks. With the first one stunning you and the next attack coming before you got control over your character. This leads to you just watching your death while spamming the dodge button to try and move away.

Ledge grab detection does not feel right, many times i was certain i would grab a ledge but fell to my death.

I cant put my finger on it, maybe it is not that greatly outlined where you actually have to position to grab. Also plenty of platforms you can not grab. By the end of the game i was able to fairly regularly grab ledges however it did not feel right somehow.

+

1)Amazing atmosphere and the worlds feel. The world feels Filled, full of detail and sovl. everything feels meaningful: from UI and to little details in the world. [spoiler] who would've thought that stepping on the books is what made the ghosts appear in the library [/spoiler]

2)Sound design. self explanatory. music sounds amazing. FX just [b]feels[/b] good.
3)Enemy and NPC designs. they feel different and very unique, and that's [strike]always[/strike] mostly a good thing. Archbishops design is absolutely incredible. Sierpes and Exposito are great too! MC design is impeccable! that idle animation is exceptional. The design also reminds me of the Glass Looking Knight from Dark Souls II
4)World is interesting. it feels interesting to explore. i never felt like it was too annoying to investigate, and always tried to find everything and fully explore the map. also backtracking didn't feel very tedious. [spoiler]although i've donoed to church early, and unlocked the teleport.[/spoiler]


- 

1)Instadeaths. Don't get me wrong, backtracking is alright for me, but visiting a familiar location with new powers to find more secret, but doing the exact same thing you've did just now cause you've died to a spike/regular pit is tedious. the fact that the look around option barely works amplifies that to a reasonable extent too.
2)Gameplay. overall its okay, but over the course of the whole game little things add up: 1)the delay between pressing down and being able to do a crouching swing 2)not being able to 100% distinguish what enemy/attack will you parry and what you'll block 3)getting hit on 1st frame of the wakeup 4)some attacks/projectiles you can NOT dodge 5)Air impulse. [spoiler]i wished there was a air jump/ down swing mechanic in this game. after i've found out about how to perform it, i wished it was never added. in main game it was needed only ONCE, i've only found out about it after like 15 hours, when playing Time trials. hate it so much its unbelievable[/spoiler] note for anyone. to perform it (in air) hold your dodge button, and hit something. To make a second one, let go of the dodge button, and press it again, hit only after that. also, you can ONLY DO TWO PER JUMP.
4)time trials. FVCK TIME TRIALS. hate it. i've spent like 4 hours on them (i've beaten the game in 19 hours). waiting for a cycle to finish in a time based mode is a horrendous game design. sometimes, in some games i wonder who hired some of the level designers.
5)DLCs. its more of a personal complaint, but not being able to distinguish DLC areas from the base game (well, you DO deal little to nothing damage in there. that might be considered a warning, but still) is really irritating. though the benefits from these are quite good (the Waterlady prayer saved me soooo much time.forever grateful to the Waterlady.)",1656528871,1665248904,True,2,0,0.524321138858795166,0,True,False,False

Just came in from trying the update, its really really good, great music, artwork and concept.

After finishing the game almost 4 times i have a pretty good idea of how to describe my feelings about this game, its great, almost all boss battles are fun, theres just one that isnt very enjoyable/fun for me, The Lady of the Charred Visage  after repeating countless times this fight, i can say that this one battle is just not enjoyable, not even a bit of fun fighting her, thats the only bad  thing this game has in my opinion, i absolutely recommend this.

After playing the game 2 times after my last update (august 2020), ive been growing particualrly fond of the ""Boss Rush"" mode with the amanecidas. After completing it various times, ive found some bugs and glitches with the third fight, The Amanecida of the Golden Edges (the one with the sword), ive found that she sometimes regenerates her barrier (the pruple crystal) quicker than usual, as well as teleporting from one side of the arena to directly be on top of me and hit me with an almost unreactable attack, she sometimes also bugs out and doesnt attack or do anything on the whole arena, and your only option is to kill her while she is standing still, or directly leave the game.

The Wounds of Eventide DLC is also something i should talk about. This might be te best game expansion ive played in any game, EVER. The new boss encounters are absolutely thrilling and always gives me a rush of adrenaline when i fight them, every one of them is really unique as well as difficult on their own manner, plus the new ending left me with a really sweet taste on my mouth. This game is absolutely one of the best expiriences ive had in my years of gaming, it really excells at everything it tries to do, be it world exploring, side quests, bosses and world building.

+) Environment is insanely well designed.
+) Music goes incredibly well with the in-game mood.
+) Optimized character control. It is perfect for the intended difficulty.
+) Battles are highly thrilling. Not the fan of core gameplay though.
+) No crashes and no major bugs(I only experienced two tiny ones- being pushed back 3 steps).

-) Metrodavinyavanyavonyavunya! Manghal! I hate this genre. Up up down left down right right up up down left left up up right down and then back to up left down down right right up down down left left up right up down down! Is this genre supposed to be fun?

-) Why so much secrecy? Why so vague with the information? If one is forced to get it over the internet, why make it secret in the first place? It's counter-intuitive! Especially if you consider the fact that you need to know all that in order to get the worthy ending. I say worthy because your time and effort deserves to be rewarded accordingly.
 Nowhere in-game you'll find out you need to break all those statues, no where in-game you'll find out you need to die 3 times with this bead, no where in game you are going to know all those secret locations that holds very important items for you to progress.

I also did enjoy the gameplay. Some of the bosses felt very hard to read, but others were amazing, and beating them was liberating. Especially the free DLC bosses. Isadora, Voice of the Dead is such an amazing boss. 

The general gameplay felt great, movement, if a bit slow (actually, very slow) at the beginning, felt meaningful, each hit has great impact, spells are just amazing.

The two annoyance I have is with how little teleporters there were, and difficulty to read what was a choice that could affect the story. 

Highly recommended.

I enjoy metroidvania games, I enjoy souls like games, I hate the way THIS game ends.

I spent 29 hours playing through the story, got through to the end, finished the game, found I'd gotten the bad ending. So I loaded up my save and spent the next hour fighting Isidora the voice of the dead to finally beat her. I get her golden eye and go to return it to the visage in the tree. THE TREE WON'T EVEN TALK TO ME ANYMORE. Apparently when you finish the game it is impossible to simply go back and get the necessary  pieces to instead get the good ending, because IDK programmers couldn't figure out how to make the Crisanta fight be repeatable? Despite the fact in the bad ending you get a ""finish her"" sort of state that EVEN IF YOU DO IT she doesn't die and instead runs off before a finishing blow... which oh idk... KINDA HINTS THAT THE FIGHT WILL BE REPEATABLE IF YOU WANT TO TRY FOR THE GOOD ENDING. But no. They couldn't make the fight repeatable and they block you from communicating with the visage in the roots of the tree. So the ONLY option at this point is to try and do the new game plus of true torment mode (there is no option to do a new game plus at the same difficulty either) or to restart the ENTIRE 29hrs worth of game from scratch in order to attempt the good ending. I am NOT letting some lazy developer trick me into doubling my play time for a single cutscene or even an alternate boss battle. I'll just watch it on youtube and forever have a sour taste in my mouth over your game, probably never to return to it. I LOVE the types of games this game is based off but this blatant inability to attempt a different ending on the same play through is just plain rude.

I do not recommend this game. I don't care that it was fun, when you rip away my ability to get the good ending by punishing me for wanting to see the bad ending too, you have punished me for the last time.

And don't even get me STARTED on how in NG+ the block which was a fundamental mechanic through the whole previous playthrough suddenly does seemingly nothing to block attacks anymore, taking full damage every time and getting stunned regardless of what timing you try.

I'm not letting you time suck my life away and I am hoping others don't get sucked in by the charm the aesthetics give off because this game is just going to unjustly punish you in the end game and make you start over either with 4 times as hard difficulty or from scratch if you want to see both endings, and I'm NOT here for that and you shouldn't be either.

After getting 2 endings , beating NG+ and getting all achivements i decided to write a review. edit: now i got  all 3 endings.

[h1]Short version[/h1]
If you like games like Hollow Knight and you are not scared of blood, then you should definitely buy this game, you will like it.

[h1]Longer version[/h1]
I have to tell, this game is not for everyone, there is lots of blood and twisted bodies. 

[b]Gameplay[/b]: Gameplay feels very similar to Hollow Knight but i really like it. But unlike Hollow Knight where you could dodge enemies attacks, here you can dodge OR parry attacks. In Blasphemous you can collect colectibles (bones) to get money [spoiler]and unlock secret boss[/spoiler]. I liked the amount of hidden things in this game, hidden items or just even bones. The game also has NG+ that makes the game harder and adds few optional bosses.

[b]Graphic[/b]: I really liked it, this game from the start shows you how bloody it is. All enemies look unique and have thair own attacks. And of course bosses really look like bosses. In blasphemous you can also unlock skins for your character.

[b]Music[/b]: Climatic and always perfectly matched to the situation. And my favourite [spoiler]when on NG+ you talk with NPC and they make the bronze sing[/spoiler].

[b]Story[/b]: The amount of lore in this game is amazing. Every item has it's own story, if you want, you can read it but if you don't want, it doesn't stop you from enjoying the game. You will meet lots of NPCs. Some will ask you for help and will give you rewards. Blasphemous has 3 endings from which 2 will give you achievement.

[b]Difficulty[/b]: Blasphemous at first looked like difficult game but you will quickly get the hang of it. Once you learn how to use parry, all enemies will be easy to beat (even bosses). Sometimes parkour will be harder than some enemies.

[h1]Overall[/h1]
Blasphemous is worth buying, mechanics are fun to learn and the amount of lore will satisfy everyone.

I'd say the most frustrating part is how little recovery time you get from an enemy knocks you back, and it's not always clear which enemies can knock you on your ass; which leads to them standing right on top you only to get hit when you stand up.

The story it's about a religious country that believed so much that pain could cleanse their sins, that it caught the attention of some eldritch...thing that turned them in all kind of monsters, giving them all the pain they asked for. It has a deeper meaning than that, but you have the experience it to understand.
The voice acting is really good, and coupled with the well written dialogs, make for cutscenes you will not want to skip.
The difficulty is, for me, well balanced: it never felt like a chore or a walk in the park. Parring is easy, but not all attacks can be riposted. You only have one weapon, but combat was never boring because of the enemy diversity and sound effects.

It has the ""Souls-like"" system, where the enemies only respawn when you use shrines to recover health, but instead of losing money/xp, a part of your fevor bar (used for magic) gets locked every time you die. You need to go back to the place you died or pay to some statues to recover it.

The game starts really hard but gets easier as you find the upgrades. It has a lot of collectibles, a new game + with a ""true ending"", new challenges and boss-rush. It also has skins for the character that you can unlock.

The teleport system starts with only a few points, but by donating tears to the church you can teleport from/to save spots.

9/10 Story. I feel like it can use а bit more side quests.
8/10 Controls. There is some getting used to the controls like if you're using a keyboard and mouse you can't rebind the item description scroll. Also the ladders feel weird to hit but overall controls are OK.
9/10 Replay value. NG+ is actually a whole different experience the first time, which I recommend, but doing all of the different penitence options looks a bit grindy as the only thing that changes is character mechanics. I've done all of them and the key is to speed run with some of them instead of doing full playthroughs otherwise it gets repetitive. The game also encourages you to use different builds for different occasions by swapping prayers, beads and hearts but some of them you would probably never use as they have little impact compared to others. There is also a good feel for progression as you actually feel more powerful the more your character gets upgraded but you still need to learn to use all of the new mechanics to fully unlock your potential. The true nature of the game is in NG+ where everything seems like a challenge.

8/10 Overall score. It's a really good game with amazing art style and I strongly recommend it but have in mind that there some minor issues that you might find irritating like the wonky mechanics of some platforming parts and sometimes glitches.

It was enjoyable enough for me to beat it, but my impression of the game is that it’s just decent to good. It has been likened to both a Metroidvania and to being a Soulslike. And I wouldn’t really describe it as either. 

I do not think it is all that much of a Metroidvania. It is much more akin to an early Castlevania, like Super Castlevania, than it is anything like a Metroid or any of the post Symphony of the Night entries. You do not get any new abilities that alter the way you traverse the world. Instead, you get relics that alter the environment. Frustratingly, you have a limited amount of slots to equip these relics and must constantly switch between them. I have no idea why they thought this was a good idea, but it wasn’t and only added tedium. There are no abilities  that offer new dimensions to how you play as you might expect in a Metroidvania. You won’t get any new abilities that make getting around faster (with the exception of a tiny, tiny buff to movement speed) or more enjoyable The game pretty much plays the same in the beginning as it does at the end, except for the addition of some new combat techniques. These things don’t really fundamentally change the game or alter the flow. It isn’t Hollow Knight where you are continually getting new abilities that greatly alter how you get around and how you interact with the world. 

As far as the Soulslike comparison, I am not sure how apt that is. The combat simply doesn’t have the depth to be on par with any Soulslike. It’s okay at best. It is very floaty and lacks any weight at all. And the hitboxes can be atrocious at times. You will get hit by things that are nowhere near your character’s sprite, particularly environmentally. The enemies are largely just obstacles in your way that you casually swat aside. And this includes the bosses. You are not going to walk away from this game thinking about a battle you had with some enemy or boss. They’re completely forgettable. As I said before, it is much more akin to an old Castlevania in this regard. 

The game’s platforming is very finicky. I cannot count the amount of times the game screwed me over in combat or jumping around by either inexplicably grabbing onto a ledge or not grabbing onto a ledge when I wanted it to. Thankfully, it isn’t a constant issue, but it will be an issue you face and you will get frustrated when your character dies because they inexplicably fell through a platform. 

Visually, the game is gorgeous. Most of the time. The world and its characters are generally really well done. And that is the part of the game in which I have the highest praise. On occasion, you will encounter cutscenes of the characters and at times they look abysmal in comparison to the world around them. It was as if two entirely different people did them. On the whole, though, the game is a visual treat with some gorgeous vistas in particular.

I ignored the story because it didn’t interest me at all. I’m not into religious mumbo jumbo. And I’m an idiot, so maybe take everything I say with a grain of salt. Some people really enjoy the story, from what I’ve read, so give it a shot. You may end up with a deeper connection to the game than I did.

It was a decent enough game. It is not something I will ever replay or really think about ever again, but I’m happy to have played it. It is definitely worth a playthrough and I would recommend it. Just don’t expect it to be the next great game.",1663791426,1663791426,True,2,0,0.524538516998291016,0,True,False,False

The combat felt stiff and the movement wasn't nearly as crisp as it is tends to be in the best metroidvanias. Even after multiple playthroughs and almost 50 hours, those criticisms  still remain to an extent, but I very quickly found that Blasphemous has it's unique strengths that more than make up for any shortcomings.

The enemy and boss designs are nearly all outstanding, which eventually made it easy to overlook the mechanics themselves being perhaps a bit undercooked. The game is also filled to the brim with secrets, and does a fantastic job of rewarding those who are curious and investigate every corner of it's brilliantly designed areas. There's also a significant amount of quality content that is only accessible in NG+ cycles, giving a great incentive to play through the game a second time. Also have to commend how much post launch support this game has recieved in the form of numerous free updates and some excellent DLC content.

I suspect that many who start off this game will have some of the same reservations as I, especially if you've played other games in this genre, but Blasphemous does more than enough to stand out on its own as a memorable metroidvania experience that is well worth enduring  a bit of jank for.",1663554384,1663554384,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Like a mix of Dark Souls and a Metroidvania in all the best ways
Gameplay is tight, where if a mistake is made it's almost invariably your own fault
Makes you fear minor enemies at the start, but has great payoff once you master their movements
Bosses are fun, usually well designed (see below), and are tough but fair 
World is interesting and lore is solid, albeit kind of hard to follow sometimes (Can be the same when initially getting into dark souls so whatever)
Good variety of powerups, each with advantages and disadvantages 

Cons:
I've played through many metroidvanias and this one has had a few moments (either for plot progression or powerups) that definitely didn't make any sense to me to do, to the point where I looked up what I had to do in order to progress, and even afterwards I didn't feel like I was missing some obvious hint or logical line of thinking.

Lack of payoff for some of the challenges: Like for the speedrun sections in the stained glass rooms, the reward for completing these very difficult challenges is a VERY underwhelming power that get's outshined by 5 other powers in the base game. The same can be said for the extra boss in the ossuary, which didn't give much of a reward at all (besides a skin I think), despite again being very difficult. 

The penultimate boss on the bridge is really unfun. Like ""EXTREMELY boring"" unfun. From what i've seen they changed her up from her old version which was more exploitable, and it seems their solution was to not allow you get more than a single hit in (maybe) after a successful parry due to the new knockback and attack patterns, where in past bosses your risk of going for a parry was strongly rewarded with good damage. What this leads to is a very dull boss where you dodge for a very long time before getting a number of chances to do damage you can count on one disfigured hand, before again waiting and dodging for what feels like an eternity (Imagine if the moonlight butterfly from DS1 required extreme focus to dodge and you could only hit it once every cycle). *This boss straight up ruined the game for me and made me stop playing due to boredom before i got to the final boss, which I bet would have been fun.* 

It just feels like they patched this boss to be less exploitable, but absolutely destroyed its balance and fun in the process, and I beat every other boss in this game barring the final one (including the extra bosses) so it's not a ""git gud"" skill issue, it was legitimately just that boring of a fight.",1662559641,1662559641,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've always enjoyed playing them on a number of different systems, and the metroidvania subgenre became particularly appealing to me. The perspective works nicely, in my opinion — it allows for ample exploration and engaging combat mechanics, and it rarely poses difficulties for camera framing and movement. Even with all the positive reviews, I bought this one alongside a few other titles while not expecting much of it, and I'm glad to say that my experience playing it was satisfying, despite a few minor flaws. If you share the same predilection for simple platformers, Blasphemous certainly warrants at least one playthrough. Let's talk a bit about it.

The visuals of this game are probably its most striking feature. I'm not an expert on art, but it's obvious to me that the artists made a marvelous job here, given the task at hand. The portrayal of a grim, violent and downtrodden world marked by suffering and despair necessitaded the creation of a pixel art that is rich in details, animations and colors. Blasphemous is inspired by catholic dogmas and gothic architecture, and its graphics effectively depict buildings, characters and creatures with a distinct, imponent and morbid quality that resembles the stuff you'd see in surrealistic paintings. All assets came together to form a unique world that constantly defied my expectations, and I have to applaud the artists for their imagination.

Not delving into specific details, the story of Blasphemous occurs in Cvstodia, a world cursed and punished by the presence and will of a supernatural entity named The Miracle. This force has warped the inhabitants of the land, transforming them into hideous creatures, each according to a specific sin or penance. The protagonist is a warrior of some religious order who embarks on a pilgrimage to hunt and kill the papal figure of a church. The storyline is kept vague and obscure, but can be pieced together somewhat by talking to friendly NPCs and reading the descriptions of most itens and collectibles found in the game. To complete the main objective, the player will face a horde of minions and battle numerous grotesque and giant bosses. I gotta say that I wasn't bored by the enemy department — there's no lack of variety here. Moreover, optional sidequests can also be pursued for additional story bits.

Given that this is a metroidvania, exploration is a significant element of gameplay. Most areas of the game are connected to at least two others, forming a sprawling maze of rooms, paths and corridors. The player has a certain level of freedom to visit these places in the order they prefer, and beating a set of levels eventually gives access to a new set of locations. Secrets and collectibles abound in all areas and serve as good reasons for backtracking because they can actually provide useful boons for the player. Many of these secondary places are initially inaccessible and require special itens to be reached, so checking and marking the worldmap with waypoints may quickly become a frequent procedure. Exploration is not straightforward, however, which brings us to the issue of traversal.

Movement in Blasphemous is rather slow and the game's environments are heavily structured as platforming segments. To arrive at your intended destination, you'll have to cross multiple rooms at a slow pace, jumping over numerous platforms, avoiding countless pits, while also fighting pesky foes. I felt that the occasional shortcuts found between certain areas didn't help much in this endeavor. There is a fast travel system in place, but it doesn't offer many portals, so one will still have to walk quite a bit after teleporting. Some vertical levels can be frustrating if the player screws up — get hit by an enemy or a gust of wind at the wrong time and you'll fall all the way down to the bottom of the mountain. Traveling through the lands of Cvstodia is a penance, indeed. You will visit varied locations, though, which is quite nice.

Combat is rather simplistic, but it does work reasonably well. Players have access to a sword as the primary means of killing foes, alongside a number of spells that either inflict damage or provide temporary buffs. The sword can be improved in terms of damage potential and variety of techniques by finding large altars in the world, while the spells may be looted from specific rooms. There are no wearable armor pieces, but the player may discover and insert into a rosary magical beads which confer small bonuses. The health and mana bars can be improved by certain upgrades, and a few relics will activate special abilities required to reach elusive places. Don't expect to find a deep customization system here a la Dark Souls, as there is no way to construct elaborate builds in Blasphemous. Action revolves around hacking and slashing with your sword and casting some spells for added effect, with the occasional parry and slide to avoid enemy attacks. Completing sidequests is important because they offer many of the upgrades, itens and spells used to fortify the protagonist.

While most common enemies are nothing but a minor hassle to deal with, the bosses battled in this game can be moderately challenging, especially if you refrain from improving your sword and health bar. I have some experience with platformers, so it didn't take long for me to dispatch them. With a bit of practice and preparation, spells become unnecessary and the sword is all you'll need to beat Blasphemous. This might be disappointing for those seeking some variety of gameplay, but I found the swinging and killing to be visceral and satisfying. I must commend the developers again for their creativity in designing their bosses. You'll find a bunch of weirdly entertaining creatures in Cvstodia, and they'll all demand some degree of adaptation. A NG+ playthrough is required to face them all, though.

To end my text, I guess the sound effects were decent enough, but I'm no audio expert to provide an educated opinion about them. I didn't notice anything major missing, at least. The voice acting seemed fitting for the game's setting and tone, with characters using archaic grammar and vocabulary. I did enjoy some of the soundtracks, but most of the songs were forgettable. Finally, if you are a completionist, Blasphemous may offer some tricky achievements to unlock, but none of them are time consuming. With some practice, however, they're perfectly feasible for the average player.",1662532142,1662532142,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It's a Metroidvania-Soulslike fusion, with a stronger emphasis on the vania part. It is a difficult game that will test your patience and reaction. However, I found the gameplay fun, especially after you get over the initial learning curve. The platforming is slow but precise, which fits well with how the levels are designed. 

The biggest strongpoint however, is how good the game looks, the atmosphere, the music, and the world building. It is definitely not for everyone, as it does contain some graphic imagery. Amongst those themes, some are potentially triggering. The one that disturbs me the most is [spoiler] Suicide [/spoiler]. Definitely not for every age. 

Other than that it has a lot of replayability, a lot of secrets, cool but ambiguous lore, multiple endings based on your playthrough, challenging but fair bosses [spoiler](Except you Tres Angustias, you have no right being so difficult that early in the game)[/spoiler]. 

Some of the downsides:
- The game is not very intuitive with many quests and items, it's almost imposible to get/understand everything without checking the wiki. 
- Some quests are missable and will force you to do multiple playthroughs. Don't expect to get everything in a single run.
-Progression is relatively weird, it's hyperbolic, meaning that once your character starts to get upgrades, most bosses won't be as challenging as the earlier ones with very few items. But more importantly, movement won't get many significant upgrades, don't expect Super Metroid levels of movement as you go through it. (There are collevtibles that you will need to backtrack to get, but they'll open up through items rather than movement.)
-Some enemies can stun-lock you with abilities, leading to deaths that feel rather unfair. 
-Occasional bug, not often but some of them can force you to reload your save.

All in all, the game is really fun.

[b]Blasphemous is one of the games I wish Steam had a ""Middle Thumb"" for.[/b] I did not enjoy it that much as the platforming straight up annoyed me.

[b]The platforming annoyed me the most[/b]: Some enemies in combination with some obstacles where placed in a manner that made some passages too frustrating to navigate imo. This is crucial especially when you have to backtrack some sections in true metroidvania fashion.

I especially disliked the platforming in these parts:
[spoiler]-The desecrated Cistern and its venomous drops. You get hit? Take a good amount of damage, fall to the ground and try again.
-The Sleeping Canvases and the platforming part with the scythes. Christ that was most likely the worst part of the game. The platforming was sure difficult but in conjunction with the instant death spikes? Horrible, if not frustrating and certainly not fun.[/spoiler]

[b]The combat however was fun 👌[/b]
It gets somewhat repetitive towards the end, however overall I dug it and really liked fighting the different monsters around Cvstodia 😎 A additional different melee weapon would have been nice to get more varied combat, but due to the story I get why the penitent one only carries the Mea Culpa.

[b]The artstyle and story is magnificent and without any doubt the most far-reaching strength of the game![/b]The monster design, the pixel art, the mysterious story about the penitent one, the miracle and the visages and it's quirky characters placed throughout the game were amazing! The artstyle was a huge part why I bought the game and boi, did it deliver in that regard.

[b]This is the reason why I'm giving Blasphemous a thumbs up despite not enjoying it that much.[/b] I don't have a reference, however Blasphemous is the first 2D Metroidvania game that I've played since a couple of years. And as the platforming was the worst part of the game imo this will be my last 2D Metroidvania for a good while. I hardly touched the DLC the comes along with the game and I am sure that I missed a lot of cool content. Nonetheless I don't see myself playing blasphemous anymore.

Nevertheless I hope for the best for Blasphemous 2 which is announced to come in 2023 according to google. The lore that the devs created is wonderful and I would love to see it return accompanied with excellent pixel art in another installment of blasphemous🙌 Maybe I will give it another try, maybe not👀",1661801872,1661801872,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The religious element in the story offer a haunting, yet beautiful, story as the game unfolds. I almost exclusively play metroidvania style games, but I find the pixel art tiresome. If the player is going to have to traverse the same caverns repeatedly, at least the developers could make the game visually enjoyable. Unfortunately, this game is not artistically striking and borders on boring. Moreover, a few hours in, I found exploration to be tedious and not enjoyable. It certainly does not have the qualities of the more artistic metrodvania games (e.g., Ori, Ender Lilies, or Hollow Knight), nor is the game play particularly fast paced (e.g., Metroid Dread or Guacamele 2). I simply could not get lost in the beauty of the game as I explored. I do, however, enjoy the dark story line, which is what kept me playing. For those players who enjoy metroidvania games with a dark story, I would turn to Grime before I played this game. If you are looking for pixel art games, and are new to this genre, I would turn to the classics first (e.g., Super Metroid). 

Those players that enjoy pixel art may find this game enjoyable. But, for players who are looking for a contemporary metroidvania that combines story telling and more visually captivating art, this game may not be for you. If you like pixel art, and are looking for a similar game, I would suggest Dead Cells before this game. Dead Cells requires less time investment, and the rogue like aspect makes Dead Cells repeatedly playable. I cannot make the same argument for Blasphemous.

It has an amazing story that leaves a lot for the player to figure out. Some wouldn't like that, but the world pulls you in. It's unlike any other metroidvania I've played. The combat is simple, yet effective. Bosses are where the game shines, though. All of them have their special quirks and interesting things. Specifically fighting the Amanecidas were incredibly fun for me. If you love learning patterns of bosses and getting good at something, this game rocks.

It isn't perfect, much like every other game. I've run into few glitches like falling through the world and dying, or enemies getting stuck in rooms that unlock on their death, essentially trapping you. I don't have a problem with them, but they still peer their head in. Furthermore, the bosses are very wildly different in difficulty and fun fighting. Some specific bosses just suck, man.

Couldn't beat Hornet in Hollow Knight, for example, but I don't have that issue with this game.  It's not EASY per say, but it's certainly doable for me.

It's an absolutely stunning game.  Intensely gorgeous.  They went hard on the art for it.

I do have one piece of criticism, however, and that is the platforming is unreliable and janky.  The boss I had the most frustration on was because the ledge grab is unreliable.  Ladder grabbing is intensely difficult if you don't use the D-pad, but it is mostly reliable if you do.  But the ledge grab has been my worst enemy in this entire game.  Still beat the boss, but almost every rage quit has been from the platforming.

IF THERE'S SOME TRICK TO THE LEDGE GRAB LET ME KNOW because the Penitent One seems to do just whatever he feels like at the moment, and lately that's been uselessly smacking his face into a ledge then falling to his spiky death.

The pixel art is gorgeous. The enemies are grotesque but look like a lot of creativity has been implemented while designing them. The animation is fluid, the movement is smooth and the action, brutal. When enemies are stunned, you can execute an even more devastating, visceral finisher, with blood and guts spilling everywhere, heads split open. The environments look good, and some of the bosses are just horribly good looking. 

The sound design is excellent. Carlos Viola is the second person after Christopher Larkin that has become one of my favourites after experiencing his music for the first time. The boss music that plays during the four Amanecidas, is just sublime. What a tremendous job. Kudos!

Exploration is rewarding. There are characters that you meet throughout the game, riddled with guilt, trying to achieve penitence in their own way. The rosary beads work well when you customise them based on your requirement. While not all the prayers are useful, some of them are, and they really helped me in dire situations.

I can't talk about Blasphemous without talking about the boss fights. The game is tough, but some of the boss fights are something else. They are so well rendered, with the punishment of the Miracle creating these absolute monstrosities. While a few of them might not be challenging on the initial run, on NG+ they become enemies that will kill you over and over. I had my heart racing by the time I killed them after multiple deaths, and only a bit of my life remaining. But the rush that came was amazing.

A con or two. When enemies hit you and you fall or stagger, they can hit you over and over, which makes it difficult for you to recover, and can be a bit frustrating. The story is scattered throughout the game, and can be a bit obscure. The idea of sin feels heavy handed sometimes, though the people in the game being fanatics,  it's kind of believable.

This game will stay with me, the way Silent Hill 4: The Room stayed with me after it ended. The imagery, the memorable boss fights, the atmosphere, the idea of guilt and sin, and the way it takes different shapes and forms for different people, the music, the artwork. I could go on and on. It's a difficult game when you start, and it remains difficult till the end, with all you upgrades and stats maxed out, but it doesn't feel unfair, most of the time.

I highly recommend anyone to play it, and then play it again.

                                 I am neither a metroidvania veteran nor a souls fan. This game got my attention with it's gritty art and gore and also reminded me of an old game called [i]'Claw'[/i]. Downloaded the Demo and loved it, controls were on point and level & enemy design were great for me. So I purchased the game.
                                
                                 I have put 35hrs into the game as of writing the review and I can fairly say that I had enjoyed every moment of it from art, music, lore and the gameplay itself. I suck ass in fighting games and souls games so even for me the game was very enjoyable and winnable. When I got the nuances of the game it became easy even at some points, but that didn't remove the joy from playing the game. Something to keep in mind. 

                                 I personally didn't encounter any bugs so far(knock on wood) but some people seem to get them now and then. As for the negatives...well ladders suck big time. They are super jank and ladder platforming sections sometimes make me wanna shove Mea Culpa up my fluffy arse.

Brilliant game, thought it would be short but there's tons of areas and things to collect and do. I got it yesterday and have been playing for 12 hours straight already, I got sucked in and I really enjoy it. The bosses are cool and well-designed (for the most part), the pixel art is gorgeous, the executions are stylish, etc. If you like Soulsborne you'll most likely appreciate this, even though it's not the standard graphics that comes with FromSoftware games and those similar.

But it's not merely that the developers couldn't execute the level of gameplay required, it's that they made many baffling design decisions which take away from the game. 
A huge problem I was constantly bouncing off of is that a majority of enemies are huge hit sponges, unlike in Dark Souls where special parry mechanics and backstabs are available but not necessary, your regular attack in Blasphemous is not powerful enough to kill most of the enemies without hitting them 8 or 9 times. While the parrying in this game is pretty forgiving and fun to do, it's in my opinion a very bad decision to make your regular attack do so little damage. In addition, this really slows down the pace of the game by forcing the player to use special attacks instead of allowing them to approach encounters the way they desire. 
At the same time, I realize that I do like Blasphemous but I wish the designers had slightly different ideas of what a good game was.

The game's combat is centered around managing your equipment, using the apropriate sword technique, using a spell that suits your loadout and fighting style, and complex movement/dodging. Not only does this make the combat very challenging, but it also offers you a lot of way to approach a fight. And so fighting your average fodder enemies will always be fun and challenging, but always fair.  And the boss fight uses all of these mechanic fully and combined with their creepy/gothic aesthethic makes fighting them really thrilling.

Platforming is challenging and sometime punishing but it is very fun, and the game highly encourages exploration because there is many hidden path that leads to important upgrade and interesting tools. 

But the best part of this game is easily it univers , it arts and it characters: it makes each encounter ( especially with boss fight ) , friendly or not, really memorable : this is definitely one of those game that you will think about for a week after finishing it. 

After finishing it, my only complain of this game is that it has many ending, and aside from the ""basic"" ending route, figuring out by yourself the step to take to achieve a different can be really criptic : which isn't a good thing when the lore is complex and scattered across many items description.

But overall, a very good game. And the game has a very nice lenght, so go for it.

This is a challenging Metroidvania incorporating Souls-like elements both in gameplay (learning boss patterns, attack timing) and story development (abstract themes, worlds, and characters). There are Spanish culture and Christianism influences in the game. 

The game is on the harder side but with enough patience, it can be conquered. There is a decent amount of backtracking especially if you are trying to get all the collectibles and quest items that reward the player with more skills. 

Graphics are great for being an indie game, offering variety in terms of environments, backgrounds and even enemies and NPCs. Really enjoyed the theme of the game and the character/boss design, as well as the limited voice acting which was very well done and added a shroud of mystery to the characters.

The art style is amazing. The way enemies look, the small cutscenes they made, the animations for executions, the overall visuals during gameplay, they are all great.
But speaking of gameplay:


[olist]
[*] Sometimes the controls are a bit janky which is frustrating because it punishes you for a mistake you didn't make.
[*] The hitboxes are [i] way [/i] too unprecise. You frequently take hits or miss a jump because of this.
[*] As a result the platforming sucks. Especially jumping from one ladder to another with a spike pit below is really annoying. Elements like these are used too often in the level design.
[*] The movement is a bit lacking. Double jumps or mid air dashing would have been really nice things that could have improved the flow of gameplay by a lot. But they don't exist.
[*] Someone decided that waiting should be a gameplay mechanic. This doesn't happen often but it's just extra aggravating. You don't just waste time trying to regain progress which was lost due to poor hitboxes. Sometimes you just sit there and get to do nothing.
[*] Some boss fights are nothing but projectile spam. Combine this with shitty hitboxes, sometimes weird controls and the lack in movement and it becomes [i] very [/i] annoying [i] very [/i] quickly.
[*] Being stun locked to death is a thing. Everything that hits you will shortly stun you. However, you become vulnverable again [i] before [/i] you can move again. With bosses spamming stuff at you or multiple enemies at once this means you can die with no chance left to do anything about it.
[*] The game is very secretive when it comes to information about anything. As a result you can either waste a lot of time just screwing around with stuff until something works or you end up playing with the wiki open. This sucks. It doesn't have to shove everything into your face right away but it doesn't even bother telling you the stats of an item. The super cryptic story doesn't make it much better. 

Overall the gameplay is just too unpolished. For a game which has been out for 3 years this must not be a thing. It frustrates you too often which sucks the fun out of the game. I assume this is also why only half of all players obtained the achievement for killing the second boss. 
I only paid a bit over 6€ and even for that it is ... meh. It's surely not worth the full price of 25€.

Most areas are large and some have gimmicks that make them annoying, as are the one-note enemies which are both made worse by the backtracking you have to do; these lead to you running past enemies and trying to get through areas as quickly as possible after your first encounters. Combat is decent but you feel really vulnerable until you get a couple upgrades, after which old enemies can barely tickle you while new enemies take big chunks out of your health bar. I haven't finished the game but the [spoiler]church area, especially the churchtop[/spoiler] is just a slog with a lot of spongy enemies you have to fight through to progress with few rest areas, which made me put down the game. I did like the bosses but I ended up running through them pretty fast and returning to the annoying exploration and non-boss combat phases too quickly.

The story was hard to follow and it didn't seem like there would be anything to spice up the game's narrative, and that kind of bleeds into the gameplay what with it being really repetitive and the upgraded abilities not changing that, especially since most of them aren't that practical. Some items you find do change how you fight or traverse but given most world items are useless and almost all require backtracking to get I just stopped caring about them halfway through my playtime.

The platforming is easily the worst part of the game, especially given how many death pits and spike traps are put into the map. I thought the worst offenders were the [spoiler]painting and icy mountain areas[/spoiler], and ladder puzzles were always a pain. Especially on the blood platforms, I would seemingly fall right through them unless I made sure the jump was perfectly set up. 

I didn't really encounter any bugs save for a fight in a locked room with the [spoiler]floating death ghost and lance lady[/spoiler] enemies with temporary platforms: the fight was hard but right as I was about to clear the room one of the enemies bugged out on two separate occasions which was insanely annoying.

Ultimately I think the game is alright, it just requires a really specific taste and the understanding that it's not 2D Dark Souls, which initially drew me in, but its own thing that has a lot less nuance and polish but some unique elements as well.

The combat is so well done, enemies all have their own way to deal with them effectively, yet this doesn't make fights drag at. Not only that, but the some of the boss fights are the best fun I've had in a game for a while.
Hidden rooms, fake walls and ability upgrades feel interspersed just right in a way that makes scouring previous zones feel more like rediscovery with fresh eyes and less like busy work done to pad for time.
It should probably go without saying, but the art for every part of this game is gorgeous, really solid pixel art, and the soundtrack really helps capture the feeling of travelling and fighting through Cvstodia.

The one complaint I have is that at times the platforming can feel a little hit-or-miss. Thankfully it doesn't have too much of an impact, but in an optional quest you have to work your way through a number of agility courses, complete with insta-kill spikes and a timer.
For me, these rooms were the only truly frustrating part of an otherwise brilliant game, and despite this I honestly can't recommend this game enough.",1660874281,1660874281,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

And as amazing this game is, I feel like that, in the end, such awesomeness could be better executed.

In the artbook, you can see how some arts were a bit too greedy, full of details and symbols, and applying them into a pixel-art game didnt work very well. 

I also saw some badly done graphic patterns, felt like a lazy design decision.

Also, I have a bad feeling that such vast place as Cvstodia is just so... empty, with so many repetitive enemies. 

The gameplay is also very nice, but also a bit too clunky at some parts (unecessarily difficult parts, useless items and powers, some things are never explained etc.).

The art style is pretty unique and forms a strong picture with the accompanying music. It manages to invoke and balance a strong grimdark tone and it lays the foundation for an outstanding setting.
That being said, the most important key component, the gameplay, crumbles. The combat is basic and restrictive, platforming feels unresponsive and ends up being more like a chore. Everything gameplay-wise just feels artificially slowed down by a lot. Even the level design suffers from many annoying hoops the player has to jump through.

I can't believe i put off playing this absolute masterpiece of a game for so long... I'm always a bit nervous when it comes to soulslikes because i'm not the best at games (not horrible either), so when i heard that blasphemous was REALLY hard i thought i'd get my ass whooped. Suprisingly i found the game to be the most fair soulslike i've ever played. NONE of the enemies or bosses feel unfair, once you got their strategies down it's really quite doable. This is thanks to the quick, snappy and responsive combat and movement controls. I don't know what it is in this game but it just feels so good to play. From platforming to combat it was just a joy to navigate this dark and desolate world throughout the entirety of my 25 hours with it. The flow of the entire game is just so good, you're making constant progress and it's just awesome.

The biggest reason i had such fun, apart from the good controls is the absolute masterclass in map/level design. This is the textbook definition of a metroidvania map, with TONS of shortcuts, secrets and landmarks. The map is absolutely massive and filled to the brink with tons of different and more importantly meaningfull collectibles. From health, mana and flask upgrades to charms, quest items and prayers. There's so much to find and do in this game that it'll keep you occupied for atleast 20 hours if not more. I could not stop playing as my mind was racing with all the things i could still do or explore.

Combat apart from being responsive and fair is also super varied. There's a ton of enemy variety and different attacks that you can use to take them down. Regular enemies are very well balanced, striking that golden line of health & damage. It's a shame that the bosses are not quite as perfect (still very good though!) They're suprisingly easy because they don't hit very hard/don't have that much health but their attacks are relentless so if you want a real challenge you could try to do them hitless. Longest i got stuck on a boss was 30 minutes but much of that was me not understanding their mechanics at first. So while i would have loved the bossfights to be just that little bit better designed i'm glad that the game flow never came to a halt due a boss acting as a roadblock. 

The setting/worldbuilding and narrative is also all around awesome. This game has such a unique atmosphere to it, that really can't be found anywhere else. A lot of games try to show a desolate and melancholy world, but blasphemous does it better than anyone. The whole mood is just hopeless, but in a good way. Even the small acts of kindness that you do by helping npc's have this feeling of not making a difference because the world is doomed. The story also sells this very well. The overal narative is just a masterclass with some of the greatest voice acting in the scene. It's a consistent, immersive and believable package that just draws you in. This is complemented by the best pixel art to have ever graced gaming. The background and designs of everything in this game, down to the smallest detail, is just perfect. Add to that the a score that just fits the game perfectly and you've got the most well rounded package of worldbuilding in recent memory.

Lastly performance and polish are stellar, i did not encounter a single crash or framedrop in 25 hours of playing, while bugs were only few and barely noticable. The game is really polished and just al around one of the best games i've ever had the luxury of experiencing. So i'd recommend it to anyone, even those that feel like they're not that good at soulslikes, just because everyone should experience the world of blasphemous, at least once! I'd give it a 9.5/10. Could've been a ten had the bossfights been a smidge better but still a super solid game! Needless to say i'm super excited for the sequal in 2023, which means you still have some time to play this masterpiece ;)

Maybe i missed something but without looking it up i wouldve had no clue what to do. A game like Hollow Knight handles its endings much better.

That said, the music and the combat is excellent. The build options (prayer and rosary system especially) is actually enjoyable. Not every one is a winner but i appreciated the options they gave and trying out different builds for different zones and bosses. Adjusting your build feels like your better prepared for the challenges without trivializing them. I'm sure its possible to cheese some bosses if you really want to though.

And of course the art is spectacular. One of the best i've ever seen in any game. The world they are presenting to us is so well realized. The pixel graphics works so well with the desolation and despair of the world. It feels like they chose it because it was the best option for the game.

It is a dark and gritty game, where you platform through a huge land cursed by an event known as the miracle. Combat is very crispy, where each slash and kill feels very satisfying. There are also executions, which act very much like mortal combat fatalities, and are just as gruesome. The platorming is not the best, especially with all the insta-death spikes and constant projectiles in the world. 
There's a lot of lore to be found in all the items, collectibles, and people.

That said, the game kind of controls terribly. More often than not, you end up making mistakes simply due to how the game sluggishly controls or simply doesn't respond to inputs at all. While running through areas you'll grab onto ledges despite not attempting to, jump back up to levels you were just at when trying to drop/jump off of ladders, descending ladders when just trying to crouch, getting stuck in an enemy attack loop because it takes so long to recover and hitboxes are often not very well represented on the sprites.

(Also, there seems to be some bugs in the current build. Having returned to the game after a few months, many enemies are now getting caught on ladders or gaseous clouds, completely changing how they are meant to act.)

Avoiding modern controllers and using one with a decent D-Pad helps alleviate some issues, but sadly the problems are build inherently into the design they've created. So I doubt there is much hope in fixing them. Worth a try if you like old school, more challenging games and Souls titles etc, but it's got a lot of problems that sadly hold it back and stop me from recommending it.",1659618059,1659618059,False,1,0,0.452176272869110107,0,True,False,False

Longer thoughts: I bought this game soon after it came out due to its striking aesthetic, but didn't do a full playthrough until shortly before the last DLC update came out. That has given me an appreciation for how much has been added to this game (all for free) to truly make it something worth experiencing.

Despite the clearly Dark Souls inspired vibe, the game actually is not that difficult outside of the bosses and the instant death spikes. So that makes it more accessible for those who enjoy a dark, interpretive world rich with lore. The art style borrows a lot from Spanish religion and gives the game a distinct look. And the soundtrack is top notch as well.

Some of my only sticking points with the game are that the combat is a bit basic for a game where you're taking out monsters with big health bars. The moves you can do look cool, I just wish there more of them to give the game more strategy options. This is also hampered by abilities that can only be changed by going into a menu whenever you want to try something different. Having to constantly stop and pause breaks the flow of the game, and I wish they had streamlined it more so you could cycle through your special abilities using the shoulder buttons.

That aside, I still love this game and will absolutely be playing more of it. Every boss fight is a fun spectacle. And the free updates improved the game tremendously, giving it a much more satisfying ending. You have multiple endings to find, secret bosses, hidden items, and a world that can often be explored in nonlinear fashion. if you're looking for a Metroid or Hollow Knight style game with darker world tones, you will probably enjoy Blasphemous a lot.",1659507951,1659507951,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If that is enough for you to like a game - please skip this review, you'll have loads of aesthetic fun with Blasphemous. This review is for those who play games and not watch/listen/read them.

Gameplay-wise, Blasphemous tries to combine Castlevania: Symphony of the Night with elements from Dark Souls. About 80% of it consists of SotN elements, and 20% - of DS elements. It is a metroidvania - an explorative platforming genre, which was perfected back in the 90s with games like Super Metroid and, well, SotN, was polished even more with Aria of Sorrow and Cave Story, and then perfected again with Hollow Knight, which blended Metroid and Castlevania principles into something completely unique. Souls, on the other hand, was blended into 2D platformers before with games like Salt & Sanctuary, and it was done well, too. What I'm getting at is, [b]there should be no excuse for blending SotN and DS poorly[/b].

But Blasphemous does just that. Developers didn't think enough about what elements from SotN and DS actually make these games awesome and how would they combine. They just mixed whatever they saw. The worst offender is, of course, bottomless pits, that are in DS, but not in SotN. Why weren't they in SotN? Because that was the whole point of the game: in classic Castlevanias, pits would bring you death; in SotN, pits would lead you to new locations, and it made the game so much more fun and rewarding. The whole genre works this way, and there is no good reason change that. But Blasphemous does it: there are so many bottomless pits and instant death spikes, that half of your deaths will be from them. Granted, there is a relic that allows you to turn bottomless pits into new passages, but you will probably get it close to finishing the game.

Ah, yes, let's talk about relics. Remember how in any metroidvania you find spells that allow you to access new locations and it is how game progression is structured? Well, not in Blasphemous, because here these spells (called relics) are [b]secrets[/b]! And the only reason for you to collect them is to find [b]new secrets[/b]! And they are far from being as good and impactful as in... Well, again, any other good metroidvania - [b]you don't even have a double jump here[/b]!!! In SotN, you could fly as a frickin' bat - and it was far from the strongest upgrade in the game! What happened here? Why is here not even a double jump - because Dark Souls had no double jump? Well Dark Souls isn't a platformer!

Most of the items in the game, that upgrade your character in any way, are useless, and you can equip limited amounts of them too - yes, even relics are limited to 3, whilst in ""any other metroidvania""© you can equip as much of new abilities as you want! You could say ""well its just different, it doesn't mean it's bad"" - but when you have a game that is designed as a metroidvania, looks and feels like metroidvania, but it twists and breaks every single principle on which this genre is based on just to be ""like Dark Souls"", it [b]does[/b] conclude in a game that is at the very least not good.

Again, I can understand people who fell in love with this game for artstyle, atmosphere and setting alone - it's [b]that[/b] good. But when people write stuff like ""the best metroidvania after SotN"", I just have to wonder: how much did standarts fall over the years? Buy yourself Castlevania Advance Collection, see how SotN's ideas developed in future titles of the series; try Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night (which you can actually buy in the bundle with Blasphemous), see how the creator of SotN himself developed the idea even further; look at similair games, like Dead Cells, Record of the Lodoss War or Touhou Luna Nights; at the end of the day, beat Hollow Knight if you haven't already: it's one of the best metroidvanias ever released, and it, while being very unique, resembles everything - from Metroid and Castlevania to Zelda and Dark Souls.",1659505742,1659505742,False,2,0,0.48271295428276062,4,True,False,False

I think the reason why is because this game is filled to the brim with fake difficulty by a designer that wants to waste your time.  Which is too bad because the world building is intriguing, the music understated but elegant, and the quality of the art is superb.  

The game-play itself is obsessed with sticking to all the worst hallmarks of a GIT GUD Souls-like experience with enemies designed to annoy you, surprise you and thousands of pits designed send you back to your save point over and over again if you can't proceed through screen after screen after screen near perfectly.

The only negative thing I can see about Blasphemous are some minor glitches and rarely bad made enemies and bosses. 
Most off the bosses are very enjoyable and unique.
The game is pretty challenging (especially in late late endgame).
I also really liked how the game was structured. Just like Dark souls 1 the world is structered so that you can open shortcuts and make it easier to go through the world.

[b]Gameplay[/b] was pretty good and crisp. The parry is slightly OP but it doesn't ruin the game. There is a wide variety of prayers to try out. 

[b]Map design[/b] was phenomenal. Discovering shortcuts, NPCs, and items was always rewarding. The world was really well interconnected.

[b]Level design[/b] was horrible. By my first 8-9 hours of my game, I had only fought like 2 bosses (of which one is the tutorial boss). The levels are way too big with way too many enemies. Now I admit I was exploring every bit of the map before progressing to the next area, and clearing levels IS fun, but it becomes really tedious due to the sheer size of the map.

The items in the world should have been distinguished at least to some extent. For example, the ""bones"" that you collect have little short-term rewards and the long-term reward is [spoiler] unlocking a skin and a boss fight [/spoiler]. I would have preferred avoiding spending time on collecting bones in the game.


[b]Enemy designs[/b] were interesting and fun. There was some repetition in enemy types but for the most part it wasn't a problem. 

[b]Boss designs[/b] were really good. Though, I felt many boss fights were dragged on for too long. That wouldn't be an issue if the boss had a large moveset but that wasn't the case. If you didn't clear the boss in your first attempt, the following attempts felt a bit like a chore.

I loved the [b]art style[/b]. I'm not much of a lore guy so I didn't explore much of lore but I've heard people say that the lore is very interesting..

Overall I would give this game a 6.5/10 (taking 5 as an average/mediocre rating, so it is a positive score).

The missing half point I leave purely for the purpose of allowing the opportunity to maintain dialogue about the game, as we all know not everyone enjoyed the title as much as the next person. The upgrade system is very straightforward; lots of unique and interesting attacks available that follow a standard platformer formula. The story itself is pretty straightforward. I was a big fan of the grim, dogmatic atmosphere the game cultivated, with each enemy seeming to follow that style.

The art direction paints a horrifically grim world that intrigues you at every corner, making exploration throughout the world to be quite captivating. The music is also fantastic. Every area and boss has their own distinct theme, each making terrific use of various instruments. I would've liked to see a few more moments in the game that make you gasp in awe and wonder, but that could just be because I played this after Elden Ring (which has an enormous amount of ""wow"" moments). Nonetheless, the world of Blasphemous is still incredibly memorable with its disturbingly dark and heavily Catholic undertones.

The combat is heavily focused on parrying, for most enemies, and thus is immensely satisfying. Each enemy has their own Execution animation (essentially a parry-triggered riposte) that is always cool to see, rendered in the pixelated artstyle of this game. Barring a few exceptions, boss fights always felt very calculated, requiring a lot of focus and skill to get right so that once you managed to beat them, the victory would feel incredibly rewarding.",1658772019,1658772019,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The art for this game is extremely good as well to accompany the exploration, it's honestly the prettiest pixel art I've seen recently, so it works well this exploration stuff.

Even the music works with it, because it goes hard. It perfectly goes with the themes of the game, which are to say; catholic, and horrifying. 
Oh yeah and the enemies also follow this theme.

I personally managed to beat the game in an overall span of 23-some hours. But there's still stuff for me to do, and honestly, there is a lot of content here. But don't take my word for it, there's a demo, and that gives a pretty decent idea of what the game is actually like.

It's hard to say what to enjoy about the game at first sight when starting it up. It gives off gothic vibes and tones that let you know its got the high potential for edginess. Yet every time I opened the game and played it never felt truly edgy or off putting by the atmosphere it created. In fact it made me appreciate the tiny details of the environment, the characters small little actions as you walk through hubs, and the NPC sprinkled throughout the map. These details are a far cry from current games of its time. The style and the care in detail is there for a 2D side scrolling platform. 9/10

The gameplay...Oddly frustrating at times with some of the platforming and actions. At times you want the game to be as quickly response to your inputs and it punishes you for attempting to act quickly through attacks and platforming. Perhaps though it may be exactly as the game creators intended to replicate a game from the NES days of platforming. A simple reminder that just because you want something immediately does not mean you get it right away because you were the first to respond to your opponents moves. Honestly, that can and has gotten tiring for me. If you can get past that type of game play and control scheme you will find that this game is incredibly fun to spend time exploring.7/10 

TL;DR Great environment, Amazing story and details, clanky game play mechanics intentional by design, and expansive map.

Presentation   9/10

The art style is gorgeous pixel art, some set pieces just let you sit on that screen for a while and take it all in. Warning though: This game is intensely graphic and morbid, lots of blood and mutilation. Boss design in particular is very good, in some of those you will die because you still try to grasp what you are actually seeing on the screen. 
The Soundtrack is very catchy though it's basically x variations of the same theme. A few more themes wouldn't have hurt, though it never gets on your nerves.
I highly recommend turning on the Spanish voices with subtitles. The English voice-over is lacks a lot and feels almost phoned in. The original voices carry a lot of the dark and oppressive atmosphere.

Gameplay   8/10

It's basically a metroidvania with a key difference. Progression is not limited by items found but by bosses overcome. That's why it also often called a soulslike. You have a little choice of way in the beginning, where you can basically tackle the first bosses in any order you like before there is a chokepoint and then again a bite of choice where to go before the final part of the game. That said, the damage and health pools of enemies in different areas do direct you a bit in a linear way, except if you choose to overcome the higher difficulty for certain rewards. So it is a bit similar in structure to the first Dark Souls.

Combat is simple but challenging, though you can get a bunch of abilities through exploration and quests, these are more of an optional way to ease up on the difficulty. Basic gameplay is very much that of an action platformer and works very well. I think Hollow Knight's core gameplay is comparable.
Most enemies are very well to read after a couple of encounters, most bosses are very hard but also well to read and won't take hours to overcome if you are used to these kind of games.

Exploration is the key mechanic and really fun. There are only two areas that can be a bit frustrating. Mostly this comes from the controls that are a bit too imprecise for a few jump passages in the game. My main issue with the gameplay is that the game does very little to explain certain elements of it to you, so it is easy to feel lost in the beginning.

Story   7/10

The story is quite vague though not as much as in other soulslikes. It's all based in spanish catholicism though it leans heavily towards Miura's Berserk, as From Software did with Dark Souls. NPCs are well designed and interesting the overarching story though won't be the main thing that pushes you through the game. There are some interesting questlines though, some of them easy to miss. There are 3 endings (which you can all get in one game, if you know how) ranging from vague and rather anticlimactic to ""WTF did I just see?"" It hasn't quite the same immersion and feeling of dread that the original Dark Souls had though.

Overall an absolute recommendation for everyone who enjoys games like Hollow Knight or From Software games which lean towards a glum and dark setting, challenging but rewarding combat and exploration without an openly linear path to follow. A bit of frustration resistance is needed though I guess that is obvious seeing what games it get's compared to.",1658586294,1658586294,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I think 'Slain (Back from the dead)' left such a sour taste in the mouth for pixel-arty style metroidvanias that I predicted just another 'almost good but no fun to play control-wise = give it a miss' game trying not to be an utter mess.

Like all GOOD metroidvanias, the tone of the game changes as you get stronger and can breeze through and not worry so much about taking damage anymore, but certainly in the early stages you've got to navigate carefully - I still think the controls aren't as responsive as they could be (the dash attack is great but doesn't always execute 100% of the time I want it to).
Music is very good (not quite excellent but the OST as a whole is extremely harmonious which shows real craftsmanship) and the atmosphere overall is great. 

I love exploring the zones and the game rewards you for it - so much so that I ended up bypassing a boss accidentally and will have to replay to do it properly lol The better levels are in the middle of the game, so I do think players starting out might find the pace a bit unbalanced at the start until they get stronger/better loot. By far the best thing you can do is donate 20000 tears to the Albero church and get the teleport ability, it saves HOURS of backtracking vs the standard teleports and it's instantaneous!

With the right equipment setup and getting better at knowing when to block/parry, the majority of bosses are a lot of fun. Isidora and Quirce were highlights (screw Sierpes!) and there is a good spread of in-game collectibles and secret rooms to keep you achievement-hunting.

Overall, not the best metroidvania, but very very good and the slow-paced, somber voice acting (though sometimes mispronounced i.e. ""betrothed"") set a great and CONSISTENT tone throughout the whole game, it's just very well put together and challenging but not impossible (spike traps are an instant 1 hit KO btw!).

Art: The game overall oozes style, the high gothic/Catholic mixed with horrific elements really creates a wonderfully unique look for this game. Most of the bosses and zones felt unique from each other and set their respective atmospheres well.

Difficulty: I don't consider myself overly good at souls-like/metroid style games like this, but with that being said I found the game pretty ""easy"", meaning that for all but maybe 2 or 3 bosses I was able to beat them in 3 tries or less. I haven't started the True Suffering new game+, which I imagine will be harder, but for the base game it was pretty easy to beat boss wise. The more difficult element was often navigating to the boss as a lot of the room obstacles posed more of a challenge for me.

 Story: Overall I enjoyed the story, it's obviously very religious in nature and focuses around the central theme of suffering and atoning for sin. I rather enjoyed the somewhat mysterious way things unfolded through the game, very much in keeping with it's Catholic inspirations. There are several areas in the game with shrines and religious sites which reveal new elements of the world and help to enrich the lore experience. Through the game you also encounter a wide variety of characters, most of them suffering from some sort of extraordinary affliction, these characters help you in a variety of ways with side quests, upgrades, and items. Pretty standard. A few of the characters stood out to me, I won't spoil anything for the review, but overall I wouldn't say the characterization was the strongest point of the game.


Mechanics: (Slight spoiler warning for relics in the game) The mechanics of the game I would say are simple but effective. You can unlock a number of moves and improve them as the game goes on, which combo in with the jump, dash, and attack you start with. I found that the combat with these simple mechanics flowed nicely and allowed a nice flow in combat. I thought the use of relics to reveal new ways of moving around the map rather than introducing a traditional double jump was a fun innovation and allows for some unique game play experiences not found in other similar games I've played. 

On the negative side there are some occasions were things got a little wonky, mostly around hit boxes. Sometimes I would dodge a projectile visually, but I would get hit. Sometimes I would definitely get hit by something visually, but would not actually take the hit. Overall I'd say this is a minor complaint though.

Overall: 9/10
I would have liked things to be more challenging first time around, but overall I really enjoyed the game.

Blasphemous is a 2D Platformer in the Metroidvania genre with an absolutely stunning art style and very solid gameplay, it's sort of like Metroid mixed with Dark Souls in that it takes cues from both games and uses them to great effect. The map is vast and darkly beautiful, filled with numerous NPCs, enemies and environments that culminate in thrilling boss battles; I enjoyed almost every moment of this game from start to finish!

The country of Custodia is one of hopelessness, fruitless penance and constant violence. The entirety of the remaining populace has been thoroughly indoctrinated into worshipping a being known as ""The High Wills"", which bestows those who hold guilt in their hearts with ""miracles"" that almost exclusively result in perpetual torment in some form or another; to receive such a horrible punishment is considered the utmost of blessings and a sign of divine favour. The world is filled with these Penitents who are nearly all visibly marked by their penance, deformities and conversion into self sustaining biological torture devices being the norm; many of Custodia's citizens willingly live in a state of eternal torment that they themselves asked to receive in order to punish them for their misdeeds. There are many parallels to Catholicism both in the lore (which is very good) and in the architecture, but the faith of Custodia is utterly without redemption and their God knows no mercy.

The art direction of this game is nothing short of phenomenal! Every single area of the map is beautiful to look upon with heavy Gothic inspiration and stunning enemy design, many of the Penitents have disturbingly well thought out designs that left me saying ""wow"" way more than I expected to. The punishments that afflict them are really cool and the excess of gore only furthers the initial shock of seeing a new enemy for the first time, there are some truly awesome enemy and NPC designs! There's tons of satisfying and gory deaths for enemies and even their designs incorporate violence in very imaginative ways. This is easily one of the best looking games I've ever played, the pixelated graphics don't hold it back at all and everything looks incredible.

The gameplay is pretty similar to other games in the genre, with a dodge, basic attacks that can be turned into combos, upward and downward strikes and stabs, a ranged attack and spells that are called Prayers which have various effects that range from damaging enemies to returning to your last rest point. The checkpoint system is essentially the same as in Dark Souls, although the Prie Dieus are typically far more scarce than Bonfires. Blasphemous also uses a death system that's very similar to Dark Souls, in that you drop a mark wherever you die that you need to return to in order to recover fully; but you don't lose currency, you lose maximum Fervour (mana) each time you die instead. There are also several statues located around the map that can remove your built up ""guilt"" for a price. Personally I like this system a lot and never felt the need to use the statues, dying and reclaiming my mark rarely felt like a chore and you aren't severely punished for dying unless you leave a ton of marks unclaimed. The enemies are quite varied and require different strategies and moves to take on, many of them reward experimentation and proper timing which makes the combat much more interesting.

The bosses of this game are really cool, if a bit easy; I beat every single boss in the game in a single try except for the second one due to sloppy play and the DLC bosses which I will talk more about later. They provide a challenge but never an insurmountable one, there were several fights where I was left with no healing flasks and a tiny bit of health but none of them were extremely difficult to beat despite me being pretty bad at platformers. I don't consider this a negative however, because all of the bosses are visually amazing and the difficulty was just right for me to enjoy a harder fight while still being able to appreciate their design. There are seventeen of them scattered across the world and I enjoyed all of them with the exception of one from the DLC area.

The map is very well designed and really large, with many varied locations that are a joy to look at and countless hidden walls and floors that lead to shortcuts and loot. Every area had a ton of secrets to find with short puzzles mixed in to break up the action, making exploration of the map really fun; I'm not an observant person but I found lots of cool stuff just by being thorough. Fast travel locations are few and far between but rarely take a long time to reach and can take you wherever you want to go within a few minutes. Backtracking is present but not to a massive degree, I went back to old areas a handful of times to use new items and abilities to find loot but it wasn't a constant thing that I had to do. I never felt lost and the areas connect to each other pretty seamlessly, despite the size of the map it's very easy to traverse once you have an idea of where things are.

The story is very interesting and the lore is pretty deep, much like Dark Souls you'll get most of your knowledge of the world from item descriptions and conversations with NPCs. There are quests that require you to think outside of the box to complete and almost none of them have a happy ending. This is a very dark setting but it never feels edgy for the sake of being edgy, it's a mature and well written tale of religious extremism and humanity's need for retribution and punishment. I won't spoil the details but I enjoyed this aspect of the game a lot, this is a great setting and I've love to have it expanded upon.

Now for the bad parts, thankfully most of these aren't major. The biggest issue with this game is that Rosary Beads (think Rings from Dark Souls) don't have a noticeable effect most of the time, outside of quest related Beads most of them are tiny bonuses that you'll barely notice; there are no stats shown in game so you just have to test them for a while to see if they're worth using and most of them aren't. Some are far better than others, they give things like better dodging and big resistance or damage boosts while the ones you find by exploring are usually very minor effects that you wouldn't notice if you weren't specifically looking for them. Mechanically, there are some very annoying instances where you'll be trying to drop down a platform or climb up a ledge and nearby enemies will prevent this from working properly, sometimes it'll work just fine and other times you'll get stuck getting hit until they move away or die. Sometimes the controls can feel a bit clunky, they usually work very well but I've had several times where it felt like my inputs weren't going through and it can be frustrating to die when you know you hit the button to dodge or block but it didn't happen on screen.

I realise that I've written a rather lengthy section of negatives (check my comments for more), but don't let those issues prevent you from playing this game because it's really fun and a real gem! Overall the postives far outweigh the negatives and Blasphemous is an incredible game, it's my second favourite game in the entire Metroidvania genre and in my opinion it's only surpassed by Super Metroid; this game is far more visually and thematically interesting to me though so it's a very close choice. The world is vast and beautiful, the enemies are very macabre and mechanically engaging, the lore is grim and melancholic, the bosses are really cool and the exploration is very satisfying. That checks all the boxes for me and I wholeheartedly recommend this game! I'm looking forward to seeing what The Game Kitchen has for us next as this game was a truly fantastic first impression!",1657972864,1657975817,True,1,0,0,4,True,False,False

Beaten the game 1 time with about 90% map exploration. This game is unforgiving if you're platforming is weak.

This game has a wonderful blend of breathtaking artwork paired with a cryptic narrative both of which promote a thirst for uncovering more of what this game and story has to offer. If you love piecing together the story versus having it force-fed to you then this game is right up your alley. 

The gameplay, however, could use some polishing and as a result, affect the score overall (could have been an 8!) Clearly the devs were inspired by the early Castlevania titles and it seems they have inherited some of the shortcomings from that series that effect the gameplay quality of life. 

Let's take a look at some examples: 

1. This game does not respect your time: You need to un-equip and re-equip ""relics"" that will grant you map exploration benefits such as immunity to poison or hidden climbable walls, most games in this genre (uhh like Symphony of the Night that released on the PlayStation decades earlier?) will have these relics equipped at all times but in Blasphemous you will find yourself toggling these relics on and off in your equipment window which needlessly interrupts your gameplay.

Another time waster: Roadblocks will appear in your way, in order to get around it you have to go through a door that is in the SAME ROOM, go through a jumping puzzle maze and pop out on the other side of said obstacle only to destroy it and create a shortcut, why?

2. You have enemies that will stunlock you to death if 1 happens to smack you into a group, huge unfair LINGERING hitboxes that betrays the animations on screen (looking at you sniper ghosts), and outdated enemy ai design such as flier types of enemies that will zip off the screen into the invincible void and stay there until you move away. 

All those complaints aside I had a lot of fun and thoroughly enjoyed the pixel artwork and exploring the world of CVSTODIA. If you love metroidvanias in the same vein as Bloodstained, Castlevania, and the like then you will enjoy this.

Ok...im a huge fan of Castlevania, being Symphony of the Night my favourite platform game.
The thing is, for my sadness, i never saw that classic honoured the way it should. 
Until now, that is. 
Bear with me for a minute...

If you put Symphony of the Night on a level, you can put Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night as a its spiritual successor (its from the same mastermind of a creator, Koji Igarashi) what game do you choose to be on par with SotN? In my opinion its...[b]Blasphemous. Its bloody, its dark, its gritty, what more can you ask for? [/b]

Made in all its pixel art goodness, Blasphemous is a visual work of art, although i admit, for the religious and conservative type of players out there, this title can be a huge ""No No"". The important thing is not to take things as you see it. Its a different world with different beliefs and morals. And in this case, being good is worse that choosing the lesser evil, and some choices will affect the endings you get. [b]Be warned!![/b] 

On the sound department i have nothing to say apart from the fact that the music and sound effects are simply marvelous.

Gameplay wise, its has a neat feature (common these days on similar games), to make sure you stay alert, like the fact that everytime you die your ""ghost"" stays on the place you fell, and until you recover it you will be debuffed...oh...and it adds up. But, ""to ease the agony"", you got the good old weapon upgrades that make the game a bit more easy but not that much (gotta find them first though). Other features come straight from the classic i mentioned earlier like the map layout with various ""biomes"" and portal rooms that let you travel instantly to anywhere on the map (if you unlocked portal rooms through the world that is). There´s also a number of challenging bosses to be fought and armies of different mobs, each one with its own attack routine and ocasional defensive ones.

As for its difficulty, its not Dark Souls difficult but its not Super Mario easy. Its challenging...true, but its fair, you just need to keep in mind not to rush into a fight, thats suicide, and remember the old saying...""Know thy enemy"".
Its even harder if you play on keyboard, believe me. [b]A controller is highly recomended.[/b]

Incidently, The Game Kitchen made a crossover with Bloodstained which resulted in a welcome addition to the game map, with a number of new rooms to discover, each one containing a frenetic level in a obstacle course type of run or a cage type of match. Bragging rights included if you can clear them all. [b]Note that this doesnt have any impact of the core story.[/b]

If you are looking for a great and atmospheric Metroidvania type of game with a rich story and good challenges, give Blasphemous a try.

This is the first time i put some time writing a review, but i need to express my disappointment.

The review leave by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198318695218/recommended/774361/] November17 [/url] summarize my opinion of this game. But a really big red flag its that this is [b] NOT a metroidvania [/b], has some hidden optional abilities (true optional, you can complete the game with the same mechanics that you learn in the first 15 minutes of the tutorial) that can be taken as a metroidvania approach but only serve as a key to explore a few optional areas and has 0 impact in the way you play or that could be useful in other way that is not ""getting access to a secret"".

I really try hard to enjoy this game, i love the artstyle, the music, the complex and dark christian inspired story, what could be a solid 8/10 falls into 3/10 by the platforming, unfair collisions, a misconception of what makes a game a metroidvania and the difference between a hard game and a unfair one.

I follow this game on twitter since it was announce via kickstarter, i was really excited when i start playing but that only led me to a big deception. My first intention was to get all achievements, i even do that for fun with mediocre games, but thinking about playing more of this game make me sick, sadly i can not recommend this game.

Holy f. This game is unrelenting and unforgiving very nearly from the get go. It began with a boss that quickly killed me. At first I thought I was fighting a Ridley style tough boss who was meant to kill me, but no, he's just the first thing you fight and have to kill. The enemies get hard fast, you can barely heal, and you are pretty guaranteed to take hits. The skill floor is high and I'm not confident mastering fighting some of these minions without taking hits is possible. In other words, I felt like the mistakes I was making were not really preventable errors on my part.

The storytelling is difficult to understand, I've played half an hour and been told quite a lot and have no idea what is going on. The atmosphere it puts you in is very good, this is a dark dark world and the game does a good job of putting you in it. The items I've picked up make absolutely no sense. One of the first item you get is called a ""thorn"" and the game explains hat it is in a way that doesn't make any sense at all. If you pause and look at your inventory for a better explanation, it gives you a similarly bad description, and you can press Y to read lore. Hang on, wasn't what I just read the lore? No, there is more lore behind the lore-based description, and I still have no idea what it does. 

Every item I came across was like this. At one point it showed me I had a bunch of stuff in my inventory that I didn't even realise I'd picked up. And there are so many menus that I couldn't find where all of them were. And when you come across all of these items that the game doesn't want to tell you how to use, especially so early in the game, you stop caring.

Now I didn't play very much of this. But even 30 minutes in, even after accidentally finding a secret passage by hitting a random wall that led to a very very open area, I just wasn't having any fun. I bought this at 75% off thinking even if I don't really want to play this game I'll hang onto it anyway, but the experience was so poor and I was having absolutely no fun with it that I've changed my mind.

Regarding the good aspects, I can list some such as 
-Really meaty and satisfying combat, that, at least during early game, is slow and metodical, with every enemy having a different approach
-The artstyle is beautiful, with a lot of detail in both characters, enemies and backgrounds
-Level design is interesting, and will have you backtracking a lot descovering new stuff in every zone
-(At least in spanish) The voice acting is absolutlely stellar, and increases the immersion of the game.
-A lot of the bosses have really cool and interesting designs and approaches, bosses like Tres Angustias, Melequíades and Crisanta come to mind.
-You can specialize in different playstyle approaches by changing your rosary beads, sword hearts and prayers, and while the game core remains the same, you will notice a difference and min max your build to fit your preferences. 

The game is not perfect, however, and regarding the bad aspects of it I can say things such as:
-Insta death traps can get frustrating, specially in enemy heavy zones like Jondo or the Archcathedral rooftops
-Some bosses (and even some enemies) can stunlock you, dealing a considerable amount of damage. Bosses like Esdras and Our Lady of the Charred Visage come to mind.
-By starting with the wrong zone, you can make the game stupidly hard, I made that mistake and almost dropped it
-The way to obtain some of the hearts and relics is really unintuitive, making this game a ""wiki heavy"" one if you care about getting everything

To new players, I can give you some recommendations that will make your gameplay much smoother:
-DON'T start by going up to the snowy zone in the wasteland of the buried churches, instead, go foward until you find the entrance to a church to enter a zone called Mercy Dreams, that path has a really organic progression that will give you a better introduction to the game.
-Don't try to rush the game, you will get yourself killed and end up frustrated. take your time to learn the enemies' attack patterns and learn the games movement mechanics and you will be dying a lot less
-Pay attention to items' descriptions and NPC's dialogues, a lot of really relevant information can be found on those.
-Always mark on your map the location of items out of your reach, so you can retrieve them once you've aquired the tools to do so
-Once you have the money to spare, donate 20,000 tears to the church, you won't regret it! :)

I love a good hard boss fight but when the save point is so far from each boss that you spend 30 seconds getting mushed into a rich creamy pate by an interesting new monstrosity and then two minutes trudging all the way back to said monstrosity through samey irritating mobs, it rather kills the pacing. Spikes being an insta kill only adds to this problem, especially with how clunky the platforming can feel.

I was going for the true ending on my run and (without wishing to spoil) there was a point where my ghost glitched to where it was literally impossible to reach and I had no way of getting it back. This would be fine if it reset when I died without collecting it but, alas, no such luck.

That being said, most of the time Blasphemous plays exceptionally well and I would highly recommend you pick it up, but if you get easily frustrated by back tracking, maybe give this one a miss.",1657255556,1657255556,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

 It's the exploration of Metroidvania meets the punishing difficulty of Soulsbourne.

The first boss you meet(well, first enemy, period) is a giantic thing wielding a humongous cross.  That should set the scene for the rest of this game.

The art style?  It's a gorgeous game.  Can be a bit disturbing at times, but what do you expect from a game called ""Blasphemous""?  The environments really send you.  Enemy variety is nice; some can be a bit obnoxious, but they're few and far between.

Controls aren't bad, but they can be a bit clunky at times.  You'll jump to a ladder and it's 90% land your jump and 10% ""Whoops!"" instant death on spikes.  Jump to a moving platform?  Oops, you're a ghost and you'll fall right through oh wait you're not a ghost WHAM instant death on spikes.  Then it's backtrack 14 screens because the save points are few and far between.  Things I would change...falls and spikes shouldn't be instant death(as in, land on spikes?  it takes a chunk of health, and sends you back to the entrance you used to the room you're in.  Same thing with bottomless pits.  Will make this game MUCH less frustrating).

1 word...patience.  If you don't have a lot of patience, I would not recommend this game. It can be punishingly(even frustratingly) difficult at times(well, most of the time); instant death is everywhere.  Some insane(almost unnecessary) difficulty spikes with a few mid- and endgame bosses can frustrate someone enough to deter them from wanting to finish the game.  It was months(literal months) in between when the midgame boss defeated me 200 times and me picking up the game again.  Learn how to use your parry really early on.  It will be the literal difference between life and death.

All of this being said, and as hard as this game is, I've put over 50 hours into it.  It's an incredibly well-done piece of art, and incredibly fun and rewarding when you finally do defeat a boss you've been working on forever.  It has to be; There is no other way one would want to see it through to the end.

Again, highly recommended, but beware...this game can be very very hard at times.

UPDATE: I have finally defeated this game.  The Wounds of Eventide DLC is awesome.  2 new bosses(which are quite a healthy challenge), new ending.
ADDENDUM TO UPDATE: DO NOT PLAY NEW GAME+ UNLESS YOU ARE A MASOCHISTIC GLUTTON FOR PUNISHMENT.  You keep all your rosary beads, abilities, prayers...your sword is the same level it was when you beat the game, and it's still a huge slog.  NG+ makes all enemies and bosses needlessly tanky, damage-spongey, and they do 14 times the damage.  So be prepared to hate yourself.",1599272222,1657161089,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You have consumable healing items that are recharged at rest spots, enemies drop currency, and you lose said currency when you die. The combat is fine - fluid and customizable through different special attacks and items.

What really sets Blasphemous apart from other games in the genre is the incessant dark tone. The game has a very ""Dark Souls"" story, taking place in a dying/decaying world, but there is a very religious angle to everything that makes it unique. Beyond this, everything is BRUTAL. Combat has you executing enemies. The bosses are Gothic abominations from the Pope's nightmares. Cutscenes are traumatizing. To top it all off, the pixel art is absolutely stunning, enhancing the grotesqueness of the world around you. Blasphemous has succeeded in taking this very dark, oppressive religious tone and making it very cohesive and captivating. 

Overall, There isn't anything in Blasphemous's combat or exploration that is going to blow you away, but it is still fun. What Blasphemous does succeed in, however, is creating a fully realized world wrought with religious death and decay that is riveting to experience.

Feedback animations from enemies getting hit felt really satisfying. Enemy telegraphs and attacks felt very fair. Fighting non-bosses was mostly about figuring out what tools you have to deal with which enemies.
Boss fights were all a lot of fun.
There are a lot of people warning about how hard the game is. I can honestly say, as far as the base game: it's challenging, but if you're exploring and finding the upgrades, it's far from impossible. I'm not to proud to admit, I'm dogshit at these types of games, and I could do it.

I mean the bosses are a big disappointment, they're not even hard or interesting in any way. The game runs out of steam halfway and starts reusing enemies and giving you enemies with really lazy attack patterns, usually just awkwardly lunging at you. Though the pixel art is very nice, I don't get a sense of atmosphere from the levels the way I do from, say, Super Metroid or Hollow Knight. They just feel like random backdrops. Part of the reason is because the music is not all that interesting or memorable. The other issue I have to bring up is the story and lore, and usually I can ignore this in an action game, but there's so much put into it here thats I just have to comment out how negatively it impacts the experience when I cannot follow what is actually going on--and a lot of it is supposed to contextualize the enemies and NPCs, but it doesn't do a good job of it at all, so you lose out on a lot. Like there's this guy in the library level who tells you he wants you to ""stop the noise"". Ok; what noise? what is making it? how do I stop it? I just don't get why they went with the ""let's not tell the player what's going on"" approach. The combat is super simple, you have some moves like parries as well as magic that you will quickly forget exist because the most reliable thing to do is just jump to avoid enemies and swing until they're dead or use your OP slide attack.

Another issue is design as a Metroidvania. You meet all sorts of NPCs who will tell you they need stuff, and unless you are playing the game with a wiki open, you will not remember who needs what, and many of the quests are time sensitive. A walkthrough is mandatory if you want to see the true ending. Unlike most Metroidvanias, you do not receive any real mobility upgrades, just a few optional ones that come from the aforementioned NPC quests that let you access other areas. These are basically just keycards that let you access new areas, rather than changing the mechanics of the game in any interesting way. This means the backtracking will be super tedious because there is no way to change the default speed or rush through an area. Yeah you get stronger physically but more or less you're still approaching the areas the same way and killing the enemies the same way.

The level design is ok. Overall I think this should have just been a linear game like the older Castlevania games. There is almost nothing Metroidvania about this game and the few elements that are, make the game worse by having to use a wiki to figure out what to do because of the time sensitivity and large number of NPCs, coupled with the tedious backtracking. Oh and here's the really funny thing, there is actually a way to make the backtracking super trivial via teleporting but it's obscure and you will not realize how to do it unless you read the wiki. How about instead of waxing poetic about guilt and miracles, the game's NPCs tell me how to use save points as teleporters? Just wtf-tier design. 6/10",1655920603,1656732768,True,1,0,0.156220942735671997,0,True,False,False

I really want to like the gameplay mechanics but the core gameplay is too bad and sluggish for me to keep playing. Maybe I will keep on playing... Its a very beautiful game but that cannot make up for how time consuming the game is with a lot of too long cutscenes and deaths that does not make scense. I get that the game is suposed to be ''hard'' but its not in a fun way.  There is a lot of bad hitboxes in the game and the combat feels like moving in butter. The gameplay feels old, like the first of the castlevania games. You dont get to use a lot of buttons to defend myself. Instead the game wants me to time the attacks of enemies to counter and get around. Most of my death is actually falling down from not hitting the right hitbox from the platform. The music is nothing special and dont keep you wanna keep walking the same path after you die far away from the spawnpoint.

TLDR- I dont like to die in this game cause of mechanics and walk to all the way back to just get hit and fall down the pit again. :'(",1656363126,1656363126,False,1,0,0.496240615844726563,0,True,False,False

- Level design: The first few dungeons are okay, not great but passable. Then the dev pretty much drops the ball and stops designing levels and instead start designing ""boring walks to the boss""
- Combat: It's serviceable, but considering it has neither extensive customization nor advanced movement mechanics, it's not great. Boss designs become a lot simpler to acommodate these limitations too.
- Exploration: not rewarding/metroidvania enough, feels more like level select approach.
The game is more or less only carried by its artstyle and nothing else. Don't get me wrong, there are so many more worse ""metroidvanias"" on steam that this might just be worth picking up during a sale ... but I don't recommend this if you haven't played the best ones (which are imo Hollow Knight/Ender Lilies which hit all the marks above) or the better ones, like Salt and Sanctuary (offers real customization and a lot more contents), Astalon (offers real level design and platforming), Dark Devotion (offers a fun curse/blessing system that makes exploring fun).

Blasphemous's tone is serious, dark and religious as the title implies. If you've played Souls series before, you will notice lots of similar element in this game; from upgradable healing flasks, grotesque enemy designs, something drops when you dies, obscure ways of storytelling etc. Despite those similarities, the game managed to shine on its own and i had a great experience playing.

The greatest strength of this game lies within [b]combat and exploration[/b] just like Souls series. The combat is challenging yet very enjoyable. Every hits felt impactful and satisfying. You can also perform executions, which look totally brutal yet ridiculous sometimes, on some enemies. There are many aspects which enhance the gameplay such as character upgrades, beads, relics and sword hearts which can be found throughout the vast world making exploration worthwhile. Some of these upgrades are also required in order to progress to some areas.

It's not possible to not mention about the game [b]design[/b]. Many enemies and NPCs look absolutely grotesque and disturbing yet they are very cool and artistic. I felt like many of them is based on beliefs and religion in some ways. The designer(s) made sure to have them stuck in your head. 

I will not talk about the [b]lore/story[/b] since it was too complicated for me to understand. The game has a way of telling story through NPCs and items just like Dark Souls and i'm quite unfamiliar with the vocabulary used. You have to piece things together to get the whole idea of what was going on. It's not mandatory to understand the lore to enjoy this game, however, i'm sure you will have a better experience if you do.

[b]In conclusion[/b], Blasphemous is the game i recommend for anyone looking for a Souls-like Castlevania game with strong combat, exploration and beautiful bizarre design. [b]Final score : 8.8/10[/b]",1656159620,1656160237,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You are in a world touched by the Grievous Miracle, an event that has turned the land into a decaying body kept in the ideal stage of suffering where it is just alive enough to feel the worst effects of its sickness and dead enough where it cannot do anything about it. It's a violent, rotten, and religiously fanatic world. Everyone self-punishes in some way or worships at the feet of disgusting alters of bloated flesh, all gifts and consequences of the Grievous Miracle. Your sword is wrapped in a rose vine that pushes a thorn into your hand. You heal with bile flasks that you rub onto your metal face plate. You die and die and die in horrifically violent ways. It's bleak, as God intended.

As for a plot you are given practically no sense of what is going on, the best you get is that you may or may not be the last member of some order of monks or pilgrims as everyone recognizes you on sight as the Penitent One and that you woke up and chose violence. You kill sewer monsters, knights, cherubs, angels, and abominations taken directly from the dreams of a early-Medieval Christian peasants on a quest to kill the Pope. Or, at least that's what you end up doing.

But don't let the player protagonists' implied guilt, monastic vow of silence, and willingness to help those who suffer from the worst effects of the Grievous Miracle make it seem as if he'll shy away from violence because the combat is brutal and unforgiving. You carry a sword which has a standard attack, a charge attack, and a parry mechanic that if timed correctly on certain enemies will allow you to unleash a plethora of over-the-top finishing moves as the Penitent One rips heads from spines, cuts limbs, and curb stomps enemies with violent rage. You also get access to a few magic spells, or blessings, that let you attack from a distance. There's also equippables that buff certain aspects of your character, giving you more damage or increasing resistances. It's a Dark Souls style affair in its gameplay: you'll go from room to room killing enemies and avoiding damage where you can and healing with a limited supply of items that refill upon resting at a save point. Bosses are tough as nails and liable to kick your ass the first time you fight them but the real challenge comes from having to balance the combat with the surprisingly difficult platforming. It's a Metroid-vania in its level design, having you traverse and backtrack across a large map as you discover new items that make you groan as you think about all the possible places it could open up for you.

To summarize: the game is good. Get it if you like hard platformers and want a setting inspired by a period of history that nobody seems to remember or want to talk about. It's a breath of fresh, bloodied, pus-filled air. Praise be to the Grievous Miracle.",1643965933,1655758641,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Gameplay really good and flawless many enemies as you progress interesting bosses but not that hard.

Level design and connection between areas are one of the best Story is forgettable but an excellent OST.

The one negative thing in my opinion and break that gameplay experience is the lantern jump it's a good idea but poorly executed sometimes you could stuck trying to perfection.

In the end it's a good game if you like that gory dark setting ez souls like game with brutal smooth gameplay.

Blasphemous is an absolutely stunning game everyone should see in motion. I loved it for the first 10 or so hours, but then it just continues to stay the course throughout.

I played through this long enough now to get to the first ending and open up challenges and a harder difficulty playthrough.  This game is a brutal treat, a gem really, that will have you simultaneously praising the gorgeous art and visceral gore while pulling your hair out as you try to fight the same boss for the 15th time.  It almost feels like a 2d Dark Souls game.  When you finally do figure out how to beat a boss though it's very rewarding and each one has an awesome death animation. 

Gameplay is engaging and fun. with a traditional 2d side scroller fighting game feel to it.  Timing matters and blocking an attack to perform an execution is rewarded with sick as fuck animation and guts and blood.  This game is gorey in all the right ways.  As the game goes on you'll unlock new move sets and grow your character and yourself into a more effective fighter.

The story is captivating but it is quite odd, twisted and not linear as most of the story has to deal with what brought about the world your character inhabits.  All of the voice work is superb and hits the right notes.  There are multiple endings and you can make choices in the game that will lock you out of stuff.  The choices and their consequences are subtle, perhaps only story related at times, and you may not even know you're making one at the time. 

The ""rogue-like"" elements do appear, you can use items to build your character and gain power ups in an order of your choosing but usually you'll find some items of particular use to the boss or area you are in.  I don't believe the levels are randomly generated, though I haven't played enough yet to generate a second world, but I'll try to correct this if I am wrong.

The areas become better, the combat becomes more solid with new abilities and better enemies, and the overall experience ends up being pretty good.
