I get my ass kicked by pretty much every end game monster. HOWEVER, the horrific lack of quality of life features in this game is astounding, and makes the overall experience more pain than joy.

You can't skip these god forsaken cringe worthy cut scenes. The story in this game is not interesting, and it doesn't have to be. I just wanna kill big monsters with cool weapons.

At the end of the base game, it forces you through nearly 10 minutes of just credits. Why?

You can't play through the story with friends. All players must have started the mission solo and discovered the monsters UNSKIPPABLE CUTSCENE, then everyone has to join someones game. 

The monsters hitboxes are just awful. Sometimes I get knocked over by them, sometimes I don't. Sometimes I can roll out of the way of attacks, sometimes I can't. Probably a skill issue, but it still feels clunky and lazily designed.

Animations need to be 120% done in order for you to do anything else, with no animation queue system similar to Dark Souls or Elden Ring. Sometimes I click to start any animation like drinking a potion or using a whetstone, it just didn't do it and with no indication. Clunky and lazy.

I played this stupid game through because it gave me the occasional dopamine hit when I smacked the monsters dumb face with a big fucking sword.

I've never played a Monster Hunter game before, but when I saw this I knew I was about to fall in: MHW is a game where you fight and kill/capture big ol dinosaur monsters, cut em up, turn em into gear, and kill bigger dinosaurs. Choose from a wide assortment of strange weapons, melee and projectile, and use traps and equipment to make your job easier. Overall, a fun but very complex game for friends to get down on. Highly recommended with some caveats:

The game design is sometimes oblique and most of the games information is imparted in either a constant barrage of tutorial text, requiring you to stop gameplay and read a combination of ""basic shit everyone knows about videogames"" and ""actual information you need to understand this game"", or *not at all* (for example, affinity is not explained ingame). It doesn't seem to know who it's catering to so it instead covers most of the bases, resulting in more confusion for experienced players (the person who had the least trouble with anything in this game in my group was the one who understood the least about games in general). It at least stores this info in a guidebook for you, but seriously guys, try some audiovisual cues and congruous design and you wouldn't have to impart paragraphs of info to the player like a fucking text adventure.

The story is the weakest part of the game and basically only exists to give you some context on how to progress. The actual writing is boring, the characters are hyper 2-dimensional, the cutscenes are forgettable at best, and the whole goal and plot is literally ""kill dinosaur, make gear, kill bigger dinosaur, make better gear"". That's ok though, it works. Switching the voice language to ""Monster Hunter Language"" improves the immersion though, as the writing can be forgiven if you consider these are literally cavemen.

This is the biggest problem in this game by far: Creatures can do status effects like roaring to interrupt your attacks, but the game doesn't explicitly tell you this is happening, and unlike any other game in history it doesn't apply a status effect: you only know it's happening when you're mashing keys and your character is standing in place jerking himself off. This results in one of the most frustrating combat systems I've ever played. Be prepared to be mid-fight when your character will stop what they are doing to comically roll their head around like they're confused as you FURIOUSLY mash keys. This is easily the worst part of the gameplay, knowing how to avoid it doesn't help that it's clunky as fuck. I get that I've been BLINDED but in what fucking universe does that mean I can't use my fucking legs? Just white out my screen and let me flail around like the monsters do when they've been blinded, or like any real thing does in real life. I get it for the paralysis, when you get shocked you're pretty immobile, but fucking blinded or roared at? Are you fucking joking? Holy fuck nuggets.
>>Like what if someone threw a flashbang in Counter-Strike, but instead of blinding you it made your character wipe his eyes and stand stationary while you watch other players kill you? That's the system at play here and it's fucking retarded. Shit ass fuck I could go on and on about how badly this part of the combat loop is designed. Everything else is fine but this is just so bad it feels like a game mechanic from an N64 game was hamfisted into a modern game. It breaks immersion, disconnects you from your character, and all around these mechanics have been done better in worse games.

We constantly found ourselves wishing for features only to find them, later, in weird places. Like at the start of a mission you can access a supply box that looks a lot like the one you use to equip weapons, so for the longest time we thought you couldn't modify your loadout while out on expedition; but you can, you instead *turn around* in the campsite and walk into the tent. Cool, okay, but why get me used to accessing a fucking crate if you're gonna make it into a tent in the game?

The main area you spawn in looks like a hub, but no players are here. I thought I was disconnected but no, the main area is a singleplayer zone for some reason, and the gathering hub is a seperate place, a small area, that nobody ever uses. It is empty 100% of the time because it's just a waste of time to go there - you can't really do anything there other than see other players in the lobby...? The fuck is the point of this?

BUT I digress, these issues are never enough to make the game bad because the gameplay and gameplay loop is so tight, and once you figure out what they (the game designers) intended, the issues are forgotten. Except in the case of being blinded/roared at, someone dropped the fucking ball there. I love seeing my buster-sword wielding barbarian stumble around after getting yelled at like a toddler.

Very fun, insane learning curve. You build a relationship with your weapon and playstyle, and once you get past being knocked down every 5 seconds you start to feel cool and aesthetic. Some of the best, long term progression of any game ever. Endgame has a lot of grinding and farming, but since the skill curve is so large you're still engaged with repeatedly throwing yourself at certain monsters, getting better at reading them each time and things not feeling like a slog. 

Third party resources like the wiki are pretty much required. You're gonna be googling how to target farm specific things you need, or farm decorations. 

Get Iceborne. The extended movesets and clutch claw are VITAL.

No regrets buying or playing this game, even if the Monster Hunter community has moved on to other more recent titles in the franchise. The graphics, the gameplay mechanics, even by today's standards hold up very well. Where it falls short for me is in the story line. It's a bit short (though I plan on buying Iceborne soon to ""complete"" the game). The boss battles are also very underwhelming; Zorah Magdaros, Zeno Jiiva, and even a couple of the other Elder Dragon fights fail to put pressure on the player to use dodging attacks and pivots to the best of their abilities because the primary targets move way too slow, so reacting to their attacks is a sinche. After beating the main story line, the rest of the game becomes a grind fest for shiny gear and clout (trying to look cooler than the other players). There's really no point in playing the game beyond the story line, or once you've acquired a few desired armor sets and loadouts that you enjoy playing.

Visually the game is really good from what I see on game-plays online (Running this one on lowest possible option as my System specs is low LMAO). Now that's out of the way here is my opinion on the game besides the Visuals.

[h2] Monster Designs [/h2]
From old to new monsters in the game, chef's kiss. It's really good to see the old monsters getting that update ([spoiler] Deviljho [/spoiler] ~ my beloved). As for the new monsters I liked the overall designs, specifically the [spoiler] Xeno'Jiiva [/spoiler], it reminds me of the battle with Shagaru Magala from MH4U. Btw this is my opinion only but [spoiler] Kushala Daora can succ da pp with its wind pressure BS [/spoiler].

[h2] Maps/Maps Design [/h2]
The environment changes (i.e day and night system and weather change on ancient forest), the design of each map, and also THANK GOODNESS, NO MORE LOADING SCREEN EVERY SECTION CHANGE ON THE MAP! So when chasing down your prey, it is more engaging and fun since no loading screens cut off your actions, cause on the older series the monsters can be saved by literally the borders of the map. 

[h2] Gameplay and Game Mechanics [/h2]
Let me start on the best mechanic of the game in my humble opinion. THE MONSTER CLASHES/ TURF WAR. IT IS LIKE WATCHING WRESTLING MATCHES, BUT WITH MONSTERS. [spoiler] Deviljho [/spoiler] once again my beloved~  suddenly shows up when I was hunting a [spoiler] Rathalos [/spoiler], they roared at each other like The Undertaker facing up with Ray Mysterio talking ""cheese"" before getting it on. My beloved grabbed that Flying Wyvern off the sky and slammed it down to the ground, and as I was watching like a Judge in the mushroom corner, My beloved suddenly faced on my direction and then JUST DRAGGED, THEN THREW [spoiler] Rathalos [/spoiler] IN MY WAY, HITTING ME. (sorry for the narration can't help it). It gives you a challenge especially when [spoiler] Bazelgeuse starts to carpet bomb your area [/spoiler].  Now throughout the map, there are stationary traps, which gives the player the advantage when the monster gets baited. [spoiler] Then when mounting monsters it now gives you an option to choose the part you can weaken and also finish it with a finisher move [/spoiler]. The clunky controls from the past series is gone, the movement is really smooth. No more stopping when consuming items (except for whetstones, which make sense) and the overall movement animation had really improved after Generations. Add to that the grappling mechanics as the cherry on top.

The weapons mechanic and game-play also slaps, the additional move sets and special abilities gives new players more chances of survival and for old players to basically exploit and break the monsters even more. The attack transitions are now really fast and smooth and makes the timing of your attacks even more accurate. My only bad take is that they removed oils for the Sword and Shield. 

[h2] Gameplay and Game Mechanics [/h2]
The sounds makes the hunts more immersive but also gives you an easier time with the specific monster sound cues, the ambience of each map is great, you can sometimes just relax, fish, or spitroast meat, and just listen on the ambience of the [spoiler] Ancient Forest [/spoiler]. As for the music, it suits the situations you are in really well.

[h1] Overall [/h1]
Monster Hunter: World not only lives up to the series, it is an evolution, as a monster hunter fan I can't wait what comes after world and Iceborne (which I will get on the next sale).",1705667641,1708590586,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You play as a member of the Fifth Fleet who got waylaid by the Zorah Magdross, a lumbering Elder Dragon trying to reach the Everstream so that it can die. Your job is to divert the Elder Dragon so that it won't reach the Everstream and cause a massive explosion.

Gameplay-wise, mouse and keyboard.

Gameloop. Kill the list of monsters. Then, go through the loop with +,++,+++ versions of the monsters. Feels repetitive. While you can hunt them in different zones, it's a small plus and not as exciting. It feels like a core Barroth model is used for all bipedals e.g. Anjanath, Gastodon, Kestodon. Then, a Barroth with rolling for Uragaan. Dragon model for Rathian, Rathalos, flying.

Size Feel. Personally, I feel the boss battles are small. Not because of the damage or difficulty but because of the number of players. In MMOs, up to 25 players (or bots) hunt a big boss monster. In MHW, it just feels small.

Conclusion, MHW is okay. Was the dung beetle a hint? It's playable but it's not fantastic. It feels strange when you compare it to other AAA games e.g. Camera-lock works in other games. MWH feels like Final Fantasy 15 minus a whole lot of features.

If MWH follows the movie, there should be a massive desert to sail across. There should be a giant tower. A spider-boss monster. 

[h1][b]PROS[/b][/h1]
1. Fishing 
Feels good to see the fish that I'm fishing. It's significantly better than World of Warcraft fishing as you can see the fish. You can't just fish in any puddle of water.

2. Monster vs Monster combat
Quite cool to watch. I like the monsters feeding on smaller creatures as well.

3. Multiplayer SOS Flare
Yes, this is interesting. Though my experience felt like killing monsters with bots.

4. Monster Riding
Yes, I like that a lot. Jump/Glide into the air and press Attack on the back/tail. If you're lucky, you get to stab it.

5. Food
I like the food art. Though I felt that skipping to the platter was too fast.

6. Scoutflies
At the beginning, meh. But when you changed the colour of scoutflies into green and blue, that made me realise there's potential. The normal version is silly, all green and you can't differentiate between quest and item.

[h1][b]CONS[/b][/h1]
1. Combat
I do not like pressing multiple buttons only to see my character perform kata and not hit anything. Having to sheathe and unsheathe your weapon is a major pain in the ass.

I really hate having to draw your weapon. The delay is so annoying.

2. Parallel Weapons Upgrading
Why parallel upgrades? I was hoping to stack multiple buffs onto 1 weapon. Instead, I got Bone, Ore, Monster, Defender, etc Is there really any difference? I didn't feel it. Maybe you need a tutorial to show the benefits of each type?

3. Life Bar
Honestly, I don't understand the heartbeat meter at the bottom of the screen. The player has a lifebar and stamina bar. Why doesn't the monster have one?

4. Ugly Icons
How in the world do you differentiate between yellow mushroom and pale yellow mushroom? Could someone make nice icons? Use images of Lingzhi vs Enoki. That's fine. Just make it discernible.

5. Confusing Controls Ranged Weapons
Why does mouse scroll work differently when you use a ranged weapon? You can't scroll between items.

6. Claustrophobic
The bases are so small. Even though you think there's a whole base, there's actually only a limited zone to move in.

The hunting zones. So tiny. It takes minutes to complete a whole run. 

7. Hunting
Quite dull. Touch some poop/footprint and use the scoutflies to find the monster. 

8. Quicksand in the Wildspire Wastes
It did not work like quicksand. I was expecting it to suck you and the Monster down.Then, you would fight in the cave with the Diablos.

9. Heavy Bowgun + Long List of Ammo
I felt that there was a really long list of ammo to scroll through. 

[h1][b]SUGGESTIONS[/b][/h1]
1. Combat
Less kata, less flashy, more hits.

2. Swimming
I would like to hunt water creatures i.e. Assassin's Creed Black Flag.

3. Hints
Shoot the stalactite? Where? Hint, please. Make it glow.

4. Body Parts Highlighter
Refer to Horizon Zero. Highlight certain strong and weak points, so players know what to aim for. Turn off the highlighter until the Researcher gives you knowledge about the strong/weak points and timings. E.g. Don't hit the scaled back. Hit the glowing belly.

5. Monster-ily Functions
Do the monsters poop? More immersive to see the monster relieving itself and then you take the moment to ambush it. Disgusting, yes. But not being able to poop is abnormal. If normal body functions don't make sense, then how about feeling sick?

6. Request For Monster
How about big Snake-like monsters? Giant cobra that spits venom. Giant python that wraps around you and strangles you to death.

7. Monster Taming
Natural progression. I want to ride a Barroth. Even better, I want to ride Negrigante.

Monster Taming at the max level? Only when you're a Master Hunter, can you move onto taming the Monsters.

8. Hunting 
I prefer the hunting style in Evolve. I felt Evolve is a good fit for Monster Hunter. Instead of +,++,+++ monsters, ""evolved"" versions of the Monster, like Pokemon's Abra, Kadabra, Alakazam. Different because their size and skin changes and they have access to more powerful skills.

I like the harpoon trap gun. It fires single traps onto the ground that will ensnare the monster when it runs by one. The monster has to attack the leash/snare to get free.

9. Evolution and Babies
What does a Baby Barroth look like? I mean, Barroths are not Elder Dragons so they should have a baby form, adolescent form, adult form. Wyverns have eggs. It's sensible to have the 3 stages of a Wyvern. 

If there's a Rathalos and a Rathian, there should be a baby Rath. Where is it?

10. Capture Harvest
If you can turn a Bitterbug into medicine, why can't you capture (not hunt) Vespoids/Hornetaurs and turn them into items? 

11. Timed Zones
So, I noticed there's water and mud. How about tides? High tide and low tide? At high tide, the zone is flooded and you're swimming a lot. At low tide, mud and no water.

13. Ammo
I felt that it could be simplified into bullets with upgrades. E.g. Bullet adds Paralysis II + Stun I + Burn V. Limited to the effects and its level. So, you could craft ultra powerful bullets by stacking the effects. However, the cost would go up exponentially and you would need a lot of resources to make really powerful bullets.

That way, you only choose 1 set of bullets and you don't scroll through the list. Slow ammo with its slow charge, like Wyvern ammo, could easily be upgraded to fire faster.

14. Food
As you complete quests and collect more ingredients, more dishes appear on your platter. Instead of platters, you combine Appetiser + Main + Dessert (AMD) into a meal. You can mix and match e.g. 
Clam Chowder + Anjath Steak + Honeyed Fruits. 
Bug Salad + Grilled Gunpowderfish + Honeyed Fruits


15. World-level Improvements
MH World feels small. It feels like it should be in an open world with various Monsters roaming all over the place. It feels like there should be Monster Territories where you have to be careful in. You can pass through but if you get caught by a Diablos, it will actively hunt you down by sniffing for your scent and tracking you (The Boss Monster should hunt you down). You have to find ways to stealth; hide, swim, crawl, find secret paths, set up bait to feed the Boss Monster, lure it to its favourite food to distract it, smear dung on yourself to make it ignore you, camouflage, choose the time of day when the Boss Monster is sleeping to move in (nocturnals are active at night, sleep in the day).

Combine Research Base with the Main Base
Put a fishing jetty in the Main Base to teach newbies the basics of fishing. The Main Base is a convenient spot for players to relax and fish. Maybe sometimes players want to play a fishing minigame instead?",1675546051,1708545787,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Start off with one of my main annoyances that hasn't changed. A monster being on the verge of dying with no clear sign that's their current state. You can have their research maxed out and still, it doesn't show the skull on the minimap straight away, if you just staggered or mount them or whatever, they won't roar and go to limp away straight away and so on so on. The amount of times i've killed shit because i've had zero indication of it about to die because i've been slamming it and staggered it so it doesn't end up trying to leave is annoying. The 2 red slinger ammo drops is not a realiable option either when some monsters drop more then 2. 

Then the hitboxes are still absolute dogshit on half the monsters, you can slow-mo a clip of yourself getting hit and clear as day see nothing touch you, but you still get fully slapped. Yet on other the other half of monsters, you can have an attack go right next to you and nothing at all and no, im not mistaking the attacks for wind pressure or explosions or whatever.

Then you got this mastermode bs, it's honestly just a boring annoying mode where most bosses just spam the same stupid move over and over, there is no fun in this. Take darkveil val hazak for example, i had that prick do his downward breath ability 5 times in a row. How the fk am i meant to do the fight if he is just gonna keep spamming it. shara ishvalda is the same with his frontal beam bullshit when im not even infront of him half the time, but at least i can still attack him while he spams it.

Then there's the fucking palico, one of the most dogshit ai i have ever seen for a teammate. The amount of times this rat will decide to bring a heal right as you healed is just stupid, no headsup, just gonna waste a heal. Then he constantly just stands there and does nothing any time you get slept or stunned, instead of knocking you over like he use to, doesn't seem to do it anymore.

Then there's stupid shit like his deployable heal on the ground, half the time i go to line up an attack on a sleeping monster, he will deploy it right infront of me mid attack, again, wasting a heal, for no reason other then bad ai.

And then the worst thing, on the odd chance i do actually die, the cats revival thing is just beyond annoying and a waste of time, might as well just turn it off, because majority of the time you get revived by him, the moment you're standing, before you can roll or block or anything, you get slammed with an attack and die again, no invulnerability for a second to let you actually react. Happened earlier on shara ishvalda, had an unlucky death and i get revived into his frontal beam. Like why even waste my fucking time.

The cooking is still just a nuisance for doing custom platters.

Armor that has resist to for example, thunder but also has thunder attack skill on it, still exist which is just stupid because you're not gonna use thunder attack against something you want thunder resist against. It's a complete waste of an armor, also got the poor optimization of the B version gear, for example, shara ishvaldas a+ boots have part breaker +2 and defense boost +2. Instead of the B version lose 2 points of defense boost, it just loses 1 point of part breaker and defense boost. Shit like this is just a waste of a piece of gear, no-one is gonna use that. Legit woulda been awesome to have 2 partbreaker but nope, ruined by poor optimization on the gear, this isn't me just wanting gear to be super convenient and broken. This is just wanting the gear to actually look like a viable option to use.

Also, wish i had the option to customize the item pouch wheel to cluster heals and traps together. Don't care too much for the radial wheel.

Oh and another massive gripe i have with the game that still exist. Using mantles, the mantle expires but when you sheathe your weapon, it doesn't auto take it off, making you have to stop and use it again. I want my tools going on cooldown as soon as im done with them, not having to find manually plop that shit off when ive already gone and sheathed my weapon.

And also the manage investigations menu, why is there no multiselect for deleting investigations??? Only options are to delete all of them or, to remove them one at a time with a prompt each time. Super slow and annoying.

It's just simple shit that makes all the difference. It really is.

Honestly, the more i play these late game bosses, the more i see just how bad and lazy these devs are. I'm fighting the furious rajang and he just uses his jump spray breath attack 4 times in a row on me, legit no didn't move or anything, he just kept jumping and spraying over and over. This is just fucking boring.

How is it, 6 years this game has been out and this is the best they can do to increase difficulty. Just make the monsters spam the same attack, over and over. Give them follow up moves to their moves and what not. Not bad ai that use same shit over and over.

Oh and one more big fucking thing. Why the hell the stupidly small amount of time at the end of a mission after killing the monster. You got shit like kulve where 60 seconds is literally not enough time sometimes, cunt has so much loot. Capture missions are annoying too, maybe you got a tail to loot, maybe you need the ore in the room. And so on so on, it just isn't needed, i will leave the fking mission when i am done. Absolute clownery

Yknow whats also fucking fun? Breath attacks that go through the floor and walls. How the fuck is that a thing. These devs are a joke.

Also, another loot related thing, why the fk would you add guiding lands, with all the loot they drop from smashing them into walls and breaking their shit and still only have a 2 minute loot despawn timer. They drop so much shit and im busy kicking their ass and loot ends up despawning time to time.

Let's add a bit more onto this. The guiding lands, cool place, bit glitchy which can be annoying, but a decent idea overall. That said, completely ruined by whatever idiot decided we can't just level all the zones to lvl 7. What a ridiculous grind that is, because for example, let's say i grind 15 tempered stygian zingores from lvl 7 hoarfrost zone, if i eventually run out of his resource and hoarfrost is at lvl 1 because i went and grinded the other stuff, i would then have to grind a shit ton of monsters i don't need a single thing from, all because of this augmentation stuff which is extremely worth getting. This really is just killing any fun or motivation, its stupidly slow, i've already done all the tempered stuff in wildspire, forest, tundra a shit ton so i dont have to relvl them again, now im just spamming non tempered monsters i dont even need, it just all feels like a total waste of time.

There is legit no reason for other zones to de-level when leveling up other zones. It's a dogshit system, if we want every zone at lvl 7, then we should be able to have it with a normal grind speed, we still have to bloody grind our way up then grind the mobs at that zone level. Absolute muppets made this shit.",1706709313,1708350830,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

But I am here to provide input for potential purchasers who are like me.  I can see how others can really enjoy this game, but it is most definitely not for me.  This game is written with a view that is different from the games I normally play.  I could be wrong, but I attribute it to being designed and developed by people from a different culture.  And while different is OFTEN good in my experience, in this case I found the differences are keeping me from enjoying it.  I suspect I'm just too old a dog to appreciate new tricks. As far as specifics (and some of these matter and others, well, are just personal disappointments):   I have never, in my 30+ year gaming experience had so much information presented to me to, ostensibly, help me, while at he same time feeling more lost than I ever have in a game.   The games continuous popups to explain were really appreciated when I first saw them.  But later, I realized, my eyes had glazed over and I was no longer reading them.  Basically, if you have to present that many popups to explain things, then your stuff's a wee bit too complicated imho.  Next, we tried to do multiplayer and have given up.  It's not that we couldn't make it happen, it's just too complicated to do!  All we wanted was to play together, and it is so friggin' complicated that we've now shelved the game.  Oh, and the complicated game play is way out of proportion to the complicated nature of the play.  In other words, I have really complicated games in my library, but the story and consequences merit that complexity.   Here, it feels like the game concept is simple, whereas the game mechanics and interface and hugely complicated.  In short, I don't care enough about the game to deal with all this complexity.  Or said another way, we though we were going to pop into a game where we'd have some fun playing together, developing our characters and slaying some monsters.  But the complexity of the interface and understanding how the game works, just sapped us of any desire to play it.  If I wanted this much complexity in my life, I'd play a strategy game (Stellaris) or a 'reallife' shooter (Escape from Tarkov), or pick up a simulator (flight or racing).  I don't want or need this kind of complexity for slashing dinosaurs.  My daughter (and adult gamer) and I got two copies of this to play, and we were thinking we'd maybe invite my wife to play if we had fun.  There is no way I would invite a non- or quasi- gamer to play this game.  It's way too complex for such a person.  The reward versus the investment of time to understand this game is just way out of whack for us.  Again, I see many people love this game.  I am not here to rain on their parade.  All I am saying is that this game was a major mismatch with me (60 yrs of age) and my adult daughter (25 yrs of age).  Now, to be fair, she seems to enjoy the game itself, but was completely washing her hands of the multiplayer aspect.  Way too complicated to figure out when you could and could not play with another and under what circumstances and only after you started your mission, but only after you watched this cutscene, blah blah blah blah.  complete insanity as far as we were concerned.  And i know there many MANY out there who will read this and go ""but it's simple, just do..""  I am a software developer who has been coding UIs and playing games since the late 1980s.  I was there for DOOMs launch.  I have played complicated games.  I networked back when we'd have net-meets and had to create LANs to get multiplayer.  I have spent hundreds, if not thousands of hours in Falcon 4.0, one of the most complicated sims ever released.  I know complicated.  But since the 2000s we have, thankfully, existed in world where developers have increasingly created UI-friendly games (I mean, when was the last time you have even seen a manual for game?)   This game REQUIRES a manual.  They didn't create one in favor of putting in all this help inline, but the fact that it is so needed is only proof that the UI is overly complicated.

So, as you contemplate acquiring this game, you may just never know.  Will it click with you?  Will the complicated UI be easily understandable?  No way to know really.  If you can, play a friend's copy, or see if you can find a demo.  I'd give you my copy but no-can-do I'm afraid.",1708347365,1708347365,False,3,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Good modernization(besides guardian), solid connection to the ancestry, a few hiccups

Recently started again on ps5 before wilds cuz of a certain stupid trend that i caved to. Still fun on my 3rd go around. Graphics are great, gameplay is good, maybe a little less complex than og system (besides clutch claw shenanigans). Music is fuckin awesome as usual. On clutch claw, I don't mind it too much, if a little tedious even with the extended tenderize time. However, the Guardian set is a mistake thanks to the modernization efforts seen much more in rise. Whoever at capcom thought it was a good idea to have new people learn how to actually use clutch claw after their nuclear sword and mega healing armor are finally outclassed is a cheeky prankster. lol who am I kidding, apathy and greed while looking at the issue of new people and dlc. Base game is still as solid as it was to hold a lot of people before dlc and you're missing out on a million little intricacies with your trainer holy sword, that you might catch in iceborne.",1708316288,1708316471,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

TL;DR
What I liked:
- Dungeon based game (can do small session of 10-20 mins and quit for the day).
- Can play Solo the entire game (HP scales based on number of players).
- Got co-op, with randoms too, mostly nice people.
- Lots of quests and story to progress.
- Many different mechanics - both monsters and weapons.
- Grinding is unnecessary, mostly a few kills of each monster is enough to gain full set + weapon.
- Easy to farm big amount of decorations (status jewels for weapon/armor)
- Graphics not bad at all.
- The scenery is very pretty and has nice interactions like swim in water, walk in snow, swing on ropes.
- Can customize the character appearance very easily (with some difficult monsters to beat to look the coolest!)
- DLC made the game trice if not longer than the base game.
- Have some nice events for full session (16 people) that change every 2 weeks, lots of players doing that content, easy to find and join (2 special raid bosses).
- 1-2 Weekly seasonal events very often!

What I didn't like:
- Hard to start co-op at first, its not very intuitive until you figure it out and get used to it.
- A bit bothersome to play story line with a friend - both have to solo watch cut-scenes before joining the other's quest.
- A disconnect from game completely kicks you out of the mission without way back (quest char slot wasted).
- Some decoration (status jewels) are extremely rare - still don't understand why.

Play Summery: 
Looked for a game to play with a friend (duo) for casuals, adults don't have 5+ hours straight of free time to play. world+Ice borne was very recommended. 
We started with base only, we almost dropped it at the very first few days because the co-op took a while to understand and setup, was very frustrating until we got the hang of it.
We got kind of pissed that we couldn't do story together from the first sec. each one has to start the story, see the cut-scene, then one has to quit his quest and join the others quest.
Game was still fun overall, lots of mechanics and some challenging monsters.
Decided we had fun, and bought DLC ice borne.
DLC has about twice as much content as base if not more - very pleasantly surprising.
Much less cut-scenes and we also figured all the co-op by now.
Played a month alone when friend was on vacation - very late but discovered the amazing SOS co-op system they have. very fun thing to help/fight with others that want to do the same quest you do.
Started getting to end-game builds and finishing most of the content.
Farmed some decorations, not the rarest thought (with my playing time only had 3 of Expert+4 and Challenger+4, not a single Attack+4!!!! why so hard?!)
Had some tough monsters to fight at the end, that took more than 1 try to learn most of the mechanics (like alatreon and fatalis - fatalis took us the longest to beat, i think we tried for about 5+ adult's days for a lucky 1st win)
Beat all the hardest bosses, got the best gear and best weapon/armor improvements including layered armor (only for looks).
Finished all optional content possible to have 100% complete quests and colored-title (about 80% achievements done).
after my 639 hours invested (MR 400~) and friends 500+ hours (MR 300~), we happily quit a fun game.",1708291481,1708291481,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There's only a couple major issues I have with it, but it's so close to a masterpiece that it's certainly worth looking past. The quest cutscenes are antithetical to the multiplayer experience, the controls are unintuitive and the tutorials don't explain very well how things work and leaves you hanging if you do things right without realizing, so it takes some research, experimentation, and a lot of input remapping (or just using a controller for some folks) to get to a point where you can be comfortable. There's a bit of friction with the smithy cutscenes and forge/upgrade UI, and I would just love if they took the new approach in Rise and stuck it in there.

You must eliminate them. Whether done by a swift slash, a great BONK or some pew pews, the choice is yours. There are 14 weapons to choose. You can just main a single weapon, use all 14 or anything in between.

As a new player, as per recommendations from older players, I suggest picking the leather/chainmail gear at the beginning and avoiding the DEFENDER and GUARDIAN weapons/armor. unless you want to play on easy/free mode. With these tools you will basically one shot every monster and not learn how to play the game properly. I am happy I listened to this advice for my first playthrough so I can enjoy the process of learning the base game. Also download the HD texture pack DLC if your rig can run it.

Finished my third full playthrough of the base game, and it's still holding up really well. This time around, I decided to explore the Great Sword after previously diving into the Switch Axe and Charge Blade/Gun Lance. Each weapon feels distinct, offering a lot of content for those looking to master them all.

I managed to rush through the base game in about 30 hours this time, eager to dive into Iceborne without rushing so much that I sacrificed my enjoyment.

However, there were a few gripes that dampened my experience. The unskippable cutscenes, the presence of the handler (being one of the most annoying characters ever created), and the moments when the gameplay holds your hand a bit too much, disrupting the flow, were particularly bothersome.

Despite these complaints, I still found plenty to enjoy, even after sinking 250 hours into the game three years ago. I'd wholeheartedly recommend it, even at full price, but it's worth waiting for a sale if you can snag it cheaper.",1535663083,1708110348,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Time to go back playing DJ Max.

Good game with good dlc. I like the gameplay, despite that the hookclaws can get old over time. The grounded combat combined with tactical awareness I need to deploy to hunt the monsters is what makes this game worth it. I do recommend people to get the Iceborne expansion as well, cause there are more monsters to hunt and the endboss of the Iceborne story line + the endboss of the endgame content are both better than the endgame boss of World proper. Only actual downside of this expansion I experienced are the copy-paste monsters in the first half of the Iceborne expansion, but it gets better later on. This game also doesn't have the 2 weeb waifus maidens from Rise/Sunbreak, which is also a plus in my book. You can also play Co-op if you want, but against Fatalis and Alatreon, you are better off doing them solo.


Favorite thing to do in Iceborne: Eating
Favorite Monsters to kill:

- Super Angry Rajang
- Ruiner Nergigante
- Fatalis
- Alatreon
- Raging Bracchy
- Stygian Zinogre
- Savage Jho
- Shara Isvalda
- Velkhana
- Namielle

Favorite horsey to ride on: Kirin

[h2] Cool stuff [/h2]
The game revolves around the idea of a monster being so significant that it takes 10-20 minutes to defeat, and makes that exciting by making monster attacks significant. You have to play around the monster behavior, time your attacks and your positioning properly. That is fun and sometimes successful read of the monster makes it satisfying. The world is also immersive, the monster behavior and how they react to the player actions.

[h2] But, [/h2] there are many problems that make the whole ordeal irritating and boring.

[h3]1) Monster combat is supposed to be the highlight of the game, but some times it's extremely irritating and feels unfair[/h3] Sometimes attacks are not telegraphed properly. It's just walking and it hits with a huge hitbox. If you're unlucky enough, enemy might chain attack you and since the hitboxes are so huge and you don't have much of a choice, you get back up and get hit. I had a powerful armor set with health up stuff when I got chain attacked and died. This doesn't really leave you much of a choice but to play extremely defensively, maybe learn the enemy for a long time before you feel confident. That process extends the already long combat. Not to mention the mounting mechanic where you try to get on top of the monster, but if it decides to attack after attack you just get baited into getting hit. With a melee weapon, you are kind of left out of choice, you just wait for the monster to land.

[h3]2) Most of time is spent running[/h3] Especially if the monster can fly. You run for 2 minutes, right as you approach the monster it flies away. This happened to me in succession where I spent about 10 minutes running and 10 minutes fighting in a single hunt. Running isn't fun.

[h3]3) Extremely grindy[/h3] I think a single upgrade takes about 1 hour of grinding, and you have about 6 equipment and about 4 layers of upgrades, at like the middle point of the game. 30 hours in-ish. That's I suspect 24 hours of grinding. I didn't go for the last layer, so yea.

[h3]Verdict or something[/h3] I've played games that revolve around enemies in similar ways, so I'm not stranger to the concept. But it became a big chore at some point, and sometimes it didn't feel like I played bad but died anyways so I quit.",1708040522,1708040746,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In the mean while this is not a cloud save, login account based game, they put the critical game save data locally to make cheating possible and there is no such thing like VAC ban to prevent you from do that.

Although some of these elements are series traditional retrospectively to ancient days like Monster Hunter portable 3rd, but the online part are very similar to mobile gacha game in recent years - - make the game doesn't experienced like a typically single play game if you ever considered something like The Witcher Enhanced Edition (Witcher 1), and more like Genshin Impact.

In the end, Capcom indeed doesn't force you to have save data on the cloud - - only have account permission like Genshin Impact to prevent you from cheating, you also get RNG chance for free instead of paying 100$ to play slot machine (also Genshin Impact), Capcom didn't receive anything from you for those rare in game items. However these game design still just make gamers to contribute online hours for unknown reason, instead of selling experience in good old days.

O co-op do Monster Hunter ***não é*** como vocês pensam que é. Vocês não podem simplesmente abrir party e progredir na campanha juntos. Se você comprar o jogo com essa intenção, vai se frustrar muito, já que apesar de ser possível, é um pé no saco. [spoiler] O player principal precisa entrar na missão, jogar a intro, assistir a cutscene, pra só então o player ""convidado"" (que obrigatoriamente precisa já ter feito a mesma coisa sozinho no singleplayer) poder se juntar. Se o convidado estiver algumas missões atrás, ele não vai poder participar. [/spoiler]

O jogo foi pensado pra que a campanha (missões principais) sejam feitas singleplayer, e no multiplayer vocês enfrentem eventos ou missões específicas. Saiba disso, jogue MH desse jeito, e ele brilha.

Mechanics are clunky when you first start however once you get into it, it becomes a lot more fluid. Exploring the world is a breathtaking sight! Of course i recommend getting the Iceborne DLC along with the game since it expands the game and allows you to unlock more weapons and armors that you can't get in the regular monster hunter world game.

the dlc iceborne adds from what i remember 2 extra moves for the longsword which is a counter and an attack that adds passive longsword energy buildup, and the counter together with the spirit thrust and helmbreaker makes u look really cool if u manage to pull it off.

While it is grindy, the level of detail sets this game apart and keeps the game play loop fun. In every hunt, you notice new details of the monsters' behavior and physiology. Like you may notice the monster's carapace protects its head and leaves the chest vulnerable to crits, or how it interacts with its surroundings— sharpening its claws on a wall or stealing eggs from smaller monsters in the habitat.

Another layer of fascination for me is the gear design. It's so interesting to see monster parts that you gathered intricately added back into your equipment. That tail that kept KOing you is now your weapon. The monster's fur used to withstand freezing temperatures is now a 50 inch lace wig. 10/10",1707772401,1707772401,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

To be blunt, the story and handler are pretty bad. The beginning is also a bit overwhelming... It can be difficult to know where to go, what to do, etc. But if you can get past that overwhelming phase, there's really something special. 

It's difficult to summarize everything that makes this game so great. The combat is obviously excellent, and the hunts all very enjoyable. Some of the monsters definitely kicked my face in, but with enough patience and the right preparation, you can overcome them... eventually! But what puts MHW above other games, in my opinion, is how alive and detailed the world is. They're all very beautiful. Really feels like you could get lost in the different areas for ages, just exploring and discovering everything they have to offer. I know I did, haha.

Even after playing so much, I still can't wait to go back and see what else the game has to offer. My review only scratches the surface of it, but I really recommend giving this a shot -- especially with Monster Hunter Wilds coming out in the near future. Anyways, back to bonking monsters and catching critters..ヾ(｡･ω･｡)

I'd never played Monster Hunter in my life. The first thing I'd seen about this series was in a video mentioning it in passing and showing a picture of Xeno'Jiiva or Velkhana.
Starting in October of 2023, I started playing this game, and am I ever glad that I did. This community is so strong and now that I'm apart of it. I don't ever want to leave.
I've already accumulated over 400 hours in this game. And I don't regret a moment of it, it made getting through college so much easier. Getting out of my tiring and boring ass classes I'd get home and hop on World w/ my buddy and whoop some monster ass. 
To anyone who is considering buying this game, do it. This is one hell of an experience, and if you play the whole thing, DLC and all, I bet you'll come back for another hunt someday, and when the servers shut down, let me tell you, it was an honour to hunt with you all. (Even you, ""Guy who brought blast weapons to Alatreon!"".)
To the rest of you, may the Sapphire Star guide you, and may you hunt on!

This game is a great starting point for beginners, but has the depth fans of the series like myself are looking for to keep playing for thousands of hours.

As far as your singleplayer games go.
Granted I don't mod your games and yes a majority of Mods are softcore p*rn, so I understand the developers position.
I as well as you don't want nude mods at public events.
Just pull a Nintendo, cancel and punish those sweaty e-sports events and players that allow nude characters of yours publicly.
Release Street Fighter games, and Dragons Dogma 2 on GOG without DRM so your games can be enjoyed forever.

This series just cost me more than 1k hours to play in entire my childhood. Just around a couple of years, i did not spend time on game anymore. I knew MHW just released one or two years ago but still not have time to play with it, until just last week, despite very high rate review, i eager to purchase this game with extremely high hope. 

But after that ...... disappointed. Controlling just too bad. I heard people say there're a lot of new moves, but i even can not control my great sword. Sometimes it works, but sometimes it didn't work. 

I thought it because of my old broken controller, it needs to be replaced. So i buy a new one, sadly new controller has the same problem. The next theory of mine is that because this game is now on PC so controller seems not right to play with it. So i try to learn new way to play in keyboard and mouse. This time, it even worse than using with handheld controller, very hard to control everything than using with controller. Try another weapon, but nothing change!

I can't believe how people can play on this game with this control. I can see this game is rate 'very positive' ..... but i wonder howwwww, it impossible for me to play with this kind of difficulty. This game seems very hard for beginner but i already play this game for a long time before, for me with this difficulty is becoming ANNOYING.

Sorry CAPCOM, i love to upvote this game, but i hope someone in CAPCOM should read this review and update control. Compare to your first MH game more than a decade ago, you had a huge drawback. With technology nowadays I don't know why you can not make a game had control at least the same as your own first game? And i really don't know how people can play and upvote for a product that not complete like this. And it even exists for two years !!!

But I have to say it: I don't like the combat in this game, and it doesn't matter what weapon I'm using. I get the idea behind making the player commit to their actions so that there's more risk, but your attacks have basically no effect on top of that. I'll have a monster down to its most pathetic state, where it's wounded and just runs away from you between random desperate attacks to push you away, and I'll still have to use five-ish combos or big attacks before it finally goes down. The total lack of any effect behind your attacks makes it unsatisfying. Your attacks are weighty in every way except what they actually do, so Monster Hunter World just feels slow.

If you manage to overcome this hurdle, after you've gotten used to how things work the game is amazing.  It's great to play a game and just enjoying the process of playing it without caring about pushing through the story or speed running.  This game has good graphics, fun fighting, good replay ability and co op which more games should focus on instead of trying to make everything a micro transaction MMO.  It feels like games like this are fewer and fewer which is why I stopped buying all the newer games released.  I'm excited for wilds consider this company is similar to From Software and Larian in not wasting the gamer's time and producing a good full featured product.

1. Graphics- beautiful creatures and battlefields at a decent GPU cost.
2. Controls- Finally consistent.
3. Monster Animations- Awesome now. I've tested every fight I had issues with the broken mechanics, and everything except the elder dragons are fixed and the elders I think is more of an intended mechanic to make solo fights more unpalatable.
4. Deco's- Finally seem balanced, I still haven't tested all the decos, but it's looking great so far.

I think i can finally put to words what i feel about Monster Hunter World. After a long confusion, frustrations, and triumphs, i must say this game is one of the games of all time. And by that i mean, i have found this game to be something but can't figure it out on whether to like this game or not.

Allow me to explain.

I have some share of experience in regards on playing acion games, whether it's ARPG or just plain action games. I found the pattern of those games are like this; Action games are divided to 2 types of games, singleplayer and multiplayer. Singleplayer games usually have a linear progression, the more time you spend, the more games you played, the more stuff you'll get and thus the more ""powerful"" you'll become. I put quotation marks with ""powerful"" because it's in the sense you're getting better items to easy up your fights or encounters. It's not that you're really becoming powerful, it's your character becoming powerful. Multiplayer games usually are not bound with that trend of progression. You could play a game for 1000 hours and yet you are still stuck in 2nd Dan (Tekken reference). The progression of a player becoming powerful isn't inherently coming from how much things you get or even you don't get anything at all besides some ""progression"" points. You're becoming more ""powerful"" because you're getting better at the game by learning a bunch of stuff related to the game or a certain point in the game or you're just better in doing some executions related things in the gameplay. Knowledge, motoric skills, and intuition. Those are three things that i think are important in a multiplayer game type to become ""powerful"". Instead of just your character, you (the player) also becoming more powerful as well in a way. 

Now granted, there are outliers from these categorizations and also there are other factors that determined a game is singleplayer or multiplayer but i wanna focus on the ""powerful"" part on this instance because i think this is pivotal on my feelings for the game.

As far as my expectation of the game, i thought this game would fall into the singleplayer category. You become more powerful by the gears that you will acquire per progression in the game. For the first 50 hours of the game, i felt that way. I acquired gears that deals more and tanks more damage. With that, i expected the later i'll get in game, the more ""powerful"" i'll become and these monsters will become just mere mob monsters. Ez 5 min runs on these monsters, i thought naively. Until i unlocked the High Rank missions and oh boy. Let me tell you, it felt like i was slapped by Baki Hanma himself. 

I was...kinda hating the game. Because the difficulty curve had gone so steep, it was painful. I called attacks cheap, i called the movement's fucking utterly shit, i called the fact there's barely any i-frames in animations is fucking garbage, safe to say it wasn't a good time. Granted, i just wanted to open up the game at the moment. I finally got it when people say the endgame is when the real game begins so i just wanna get through the story and learning about the actual game later on. 

This is where i'll say about the game, that this game is HARD AS GODDAMN IT HAS ANY RIGHT TO BE. Some of the monsters just can't be done with in solo and even if you do, it either requires patience, commitment, time, or some videogame knowledge like AI exploits and whatnot. I did not expect this AT ALL. I thought because it relies on gears, i just wanted to get through with it so i can finally get the ""powerful"" gears and learn more in-depth about the monsters later (in solo ofc, just to be clear here). 

After approximately 300 hours and still counting in game, i can safely say this is not the actual case at all with the game. Gears can only bring you so far in the actual game itself but the most important thing is how well you know about the game and the monsters. The little tidbits about the monsters, the environment, the pickables, and the timing of when to do what. Those are the things that you'll actually need to have to get better in the game. Even with the worst gear possible, with those things in your pocket already enough to beat a monster. Also you'll need a good hardware such as decent GPU, decent CPU, decent monitor, a comfy pad or KBM with the mouse particularly have at least 5 buttons on it. 

And this is where i realised that i might have perceived this game wrong this whole time. The multiplayer isn't a part of the endgame. It's not just there as a good novelty for the players to enjoy with their friends or some randos to prolong the longevity of the game. The game IS mainly a multiplayer game. The story is just a guide or an introduction to you to get to know the monsters better before jumping online and they have to force you to do so because again, it's mainly a multiplayer game. No compensations for you in the story because the game doesn't wanna be an irresponsible parent for letting you play with other higher rank players without knowing what the game is first and being a dead weight as a result. 

You're not getting good by just getting good gears, you're getting good by learning the game thoroghly. Every encounter is a battle to the death, even with a Jagras later on. Every monster's attack is a cry for help, your every attacks always have death peeking on you, every monster's flinch is a breather moment. Every single thing you do is a matter of life and death. It will all come down to your knowledge and intuition and hell there's nothing more primal than that.

And i think now i understand why people hail this game so much. There's so little game that offer this kind of experience and even if they remotely do, it's been muddied with some toxicity of some dick measuring contest or hell even some toxicity in multiplayer in general. Monster Hunter World isn't innocent on that front either, which is why it's kinda sad and upsetting whenever someone got carted there'll be one ""git gud nub lol"" auto chat. They missed the point of the game. The game is all about camaraderie, about bonding with other people within the game. There's little benefit to be had for being a god solo runner in the game and so what if you are master in this game? Girls will wet knowing you beat Fatalis solo with 4 player health on? Or you'll get a head or something? Hell no. Ranks aren't important even, so why bother with the shittalk. People will just see you got small dick and needing praise for being good at a videogame, A PVE VIDEOGAME THAT IS WHICH EVEN MORE OF A LAUGHING STO-*ehem*

I personally can't say that i love the game as a whole but i also can't say i dislike the game at all. If i was in a healthier mindset, i would enjoy the hell out of this game with its all punishing difficulty glory. It's just unfortunate that because i'm not, i can't enjoy it to the fullest. 

However, if you're looking for a good long 40 minute time killer, or a game that you can bond with someone, or a game that awakens your primal instinct for some life or death encounters, this game is totally for you.

Pros: 
- Easy to pick-up but hard to master type game
- its armor/weapon based build system
- some compare it as just a ""bosh rush Dark souls"", but you spent less time rolling around dodging attack and it's more fair boss battle as the boss can get staggered through attacking instead of needing an ultra instinct level parry

cons:
- open-world / stage but not really (make sense since its pre-MH:Rise) there's part of environmental in the map that you can't get through
- it have its frustrating moment (hardcore fan who never came out of their parents basement called it as ""the wall"") but nothing frustrating more than fighting one monster named ""Kushala Daora"" 
- If the main aspect is feeling the combat and defeating monster, 100 hours is enough to feel satisfied. the rest of 1000+ or 10000+ play time of MH player, its either they are hardcore fan, or they stuck in the grind to find that one Attack jewel deco that login and play MHW for few hours each day is necessary just like smoker need to smoke 2 packs of Cigarette everyday 
- there's gacha aspect of the game in rarity drop rate of monster parts, and in additional skill (Deco) drop-rate, and the gacha system is build in pre ""pity"" system, and made by a country with gambling addiction that even their own-made religion have a lottery of ""how fortunate are you"" so get ready for 10000+ hours of trying to get that one piece of attack boost Deco",1707353330,1707353330,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

With all my praise, it's not a perfect game. Here are my complaints that you should be aware of:
Unskipable cut scene 
If you play with a friend, why can't we both watch the cut scene

Decoration system is annoying and is not like this in other games
Flying monsters are annoying to fight with melee weapons (This is made much worse in iceborne)

1st: The fauna is way more diverse and really feels lived in and a real echo system. Rise maps feels like a bunch of open area connected by little corridor.

2nd: World maps feels so much bigger, because you are allowed to fast travel with you dog in Rise the map feels smaller.

3rd: The wire bug in Rise breaks the game a little, you can bug out in case of danger.

It might sound like I'm shitting on Rise, but I'm not, I'm just pointing out what I prefer in World and why. I loved my time with Rise and don't regret it, but World is now my new addiction.

After slogging through a few hours of the black dragon endgame grind and the VERY apparent elitism around these fights. I can definitively say these fights are probably the worst fights in the entire game. These two black dragons are the first time I ever saw players drop a hunt before it finishes. They are gatekept and punishment adverse fights. They require more specific builds, and do not allow for environmental advantages. You fight fatalis and altreon on their turf.


The game took me around 85 hours to lazily meander through. The difficulty curve is a bit weird with the clutch claw in base world. The clutch claw and defender set have no reason to be in base mhw.

So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, created my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join.

I'm very glad I gave it a second glance and am kicking myself for not sticking with it sooner. I've since put in over 550 hours into World and have taken a 4th new character to endgame.

Fantastic gameplay, excellent music, and a ""cavepunk"" or ""primalpunk"" aesthetic that has grown on me. It's not the typical fantasy with elves and magic like I assumed it was. There rally is no magic. There is technology that just works, like the Dragonator - a steam-powered pneumatic ship-mounted battering ram\harpoon\drill designed to pierce the hide of an Elder Dragon (""Elder Dragon"" being less of a reference to mythical creatures and more a phylogenetic classification - like ""Leviathan"" from Subnautica.)

The game has a detailed ecology simulation that would make Sir David Attenburough proud. Some of the most superlative enemy AI that I've encountered in a videogame. Each monster has their own personality, you can almost see it in their eyes when they look your way, and you realize that this is the moment that they've decided to ruin your day. It's great.

Capcom's ""Return to World"" campaign along with the announcement of Monster Hunter: Wilds has lead to a resurgence in player numbers.

On Playstation people helped out one another but apparently on PC nobody helps and if they do they faint more than they should like they never played this game before, I assume they lack skill from playing with to many mods in their games which id rather not call for sos in serious hunts.

I also feel alone when I play the story? I do every single thing there is to do but my teammates do F all? nothing...I see a hunter with a big green rathian sword, the Chiefs son, the handler and they do 0. Why not have them come on quests with me or do something so I do feel like the story isnt inclusive to the cut scenes. I see everyone doing the one for all and all for one but when in game its all for one and good luck bymyself!? THEN when I do everything and everyone is celebrating at the end like we been through some flippin unknown adventure that I never saw, idk what they a celebrating when I did everything.

You do have to add story to the gameplay and not just the cutscenes and add something else other than just hunting, you cant just make that the whole game, it needs like another element to the game. Maybe add being on a ship and battling pirates or monsters from the deep, underwater levels would have been nice, maybe even base building and not on a large scale but maybe a small village you can customize. 

Other than that its a 9 out of 10 game for me, buy it and play it. I wouldnt recommend to players who use mods cause you are not good at helping, thank.

For new players, if you enjoy games where you fight monsters and grow stronger eventually then definitely play this game. They have introduced a defender armor so that returning players can finish main story at GOD level equipment and start playing the DLC. I personally will recommend you to not use this armor/weapons. They are stat inflated for the early level and it will take away the experience of the game, let's be honest that's why we buy these games and not for multiplayer. Multiplayer is a added bonus, not the MSP ( main selling point ). 

Game is welcoming for casual players and rewarding for players aiming to hit the maximum skill cap. No idea why you will skip this one, unless you do not like genre then it is completely fine.

- no 16:10 support

- checking the options and getting through the character creation and to/through the tutorial with its super long cutscenes goes way beyond 2 hours. so the refund period will be over before you can even actually try the game. it's a scam so it's better to read online or know the other games before buying/running this one

- npcs can't shut up and talk all day long

- recycling, grindign meager content of a few mobs copy/pasted and recolored

- controls are very unintuitive and erratic, they are just awful overall. the autolock system has to be ignored and unbound, with a mouse it will swap between targets super fast from any movement input and disable itself but stick long enough to make the camera annoyingly spin around, and even if remaining locked, be completely useless as it can't really reliably help the character face the right directions, and yet it can't easily be canceled once activated. useless.

the weapons are frustrating to use. i don't know how ""many"" people can play this trash. i had played some previous mh game and it was not so bad. the control schemes for any weapon make little sense. and sometimes things work, sometimes they don't, and others simply never do anything, i don't know if it's because they fucked up the keys display from the tutorial which happens a lot with shitty developers (they don't know that non-qwerty keyboards exist either apparently, or are just too shitty to add proper support), or something else. the game will bind the same functions over multiple keys and have somewhat conflicting and confusing keys and functions, and this is generally true for the whole game with menus navigation making absolutely no sense with no ergonomy and requiring loads of different keys and time just to do one thing. have fun being stuck in a ""yes/no"" window with no escape because your character tried to grab a resource while already having full inventory while a boss just keeps running. also being supposed to use menus in real time for items. place a trap ? use a dozen different keys throught 4-5 different menus and sub-menus in real time, then pray for the trap to not be bugged, because it usually does and can't be placed, just for the boss to not be captured when walking on it and it being thrown 4 tranquilizers at it and then 4 more and then a few more hits just in case even though since the beginning it was limping and with a skull icon and the game said it would guarantee a catch (and with only 1 or 2 tranquilizers) and you have to start all over again with no success on this single stupid early quest in 5 hours (one of the worst i have ever played in a game) and somehow this time the trap can be used from one of the two ""quick"" scroll/radial menus back again

again, the weapons are not fun to use. it's clunky, the character is slow as fuck and can't be readjusted in a logical manner, the player has to wait long times to do so and even from the point of view of the character it makes no sense. wait a long time before throwing a second attack in a different direction to change the direction and push the attack button or the character will stick with the previous direction. no, holding the new direction and waiting to push the attack buttons won't work. to use items like grinding stone to re-apply boost to the weapon, the character sheathes its weapon away... then fucking draws it back and then uses the stone, and all that takes animation time over several different sequences. SMART. the hitboxes are all over the place as well. you can dodge an attack 3 seconds before a boss does it or reaches you and it still hits. you can be BEHIND OR TO THE SIDE of a boss when it charges forward with a wide gap between it and the player character, and it hits. they can also run through the ground and the walls and hit from the ground while the player character is out of range around cliffs above it or hit through layers of the map through non-destructible walls. and this is in SINGLEPLAYER. i don't know if it still connects online but either way it's just plain dumb. and the player weapons can't hit anything. too low of a reach, and ridiculously slow speeds that don't match how the mobs are designed. or they can simply combo and stunlock your character until it dies and you have no input in the game, or one shot it with instant-cast attacks that are completely unavoidable. the game just decides that the player has to lose and nothing can be done about it. then even if you manage to hit, if you don't hit on their weak spots (you can't always/can't hit them on their weak spot depending of weapon and mob), it's mostly weak all bland ""resist"" damages to make sure you can't have fun with this $600 dlc fest of a fake game

it's like black desert's combat except they managed to make it convoluted, unintuitive, clunky, frustrating to use and buggy, all while having a much slower pacing and with a lot less abilities.

- the game is completely unbalanced. armors and weapon upgrades are useless, and they can't even be done anyway. no matter how many bosses i kill, in 15 active hours played i got enough to craft a weapon and give it slight upgrades twice. the game throws more craft choices but they all suck and are worse than the 1-2 first new crafts we discover from the first bosses. reading up online it appears to be ""normal"" (lol) and that players should ignore all the armors and weapons except the endgame ones. picking armor parts for their passive upgrades almost always means having a very dumb looking mis-matched armor. nice game design

- no respect for player's time. outside of glitches, the game unfairly punishes the player for no valid reason. you want to go roam mode instead of being tied to quests ? the bosses simply run away after you spent 15-20 minutes hitting them and you get NOTHING. you want bosses at all ? lol nope, try and run around the map for several minutes at a time just to see if any of them at once is spawning so you can play the fucking game. killed a boss after a 30 minutes fight ? GG preybirds come and steal the loot away from you. TRY AGAIN. you don't pick your hard-earned loot within 60 seconds ? THE GAME DESPAWNS IT. TRY AGAIN. you spent AN HOUR chasing a boss that always flies away and you have to hold foward + shift for 2 minutes straight every time and you run out of time because it's a health sponge and the game only lets you have weak garbage weapon that does no damages but still manage to almost kill the boss and the game just times out like that ? YOU GET NOTHING. TRY AGAIN.

- peer to peer online game with steam drm but requires online drm checks from capcom to be used and periodic checks to be used offline

- all content is downloaded (and payed for). have to pay more to access all of it. it's exactly the same as on-disk dlc (with the bonus of taking 50GB of space more for stuff you are prevented from using) but people are too stupid to complain about it and will even defend it

- around $600 ""worth"" of paywall dlc. it's 0 and should be priced as such. they also try to force you to throw money at them to change your character's name and looks with ""tickets"" that are one-time use. ""anti-piracy"" is great

- predatory ""expansion"" (which is the same as a dlc despite what shills and stupid people would claim) that not only adds a paywall that splits the playerbase, but negatively affects the base game by changing it by buffing the monsters and creating huge player gear powercreep so that players who don't buy the expansion were rendered weaker. buying iceborne also gives access to an overpowered starting armor set that trivializes the content of the original game and is selectable right from the start (character creation even), without informing the player about its real impact on the game

- like nintendo, capcom abuses copyright ""laws"" to delete mod-related content (videos etc.)",1704146516,1707029801,False,1,6,0.321947991847991943,0,True,False,False

This game manages to combine the MMO feel of these games with the difficulty of a souls game at times. Unlike the souls games, you get a slap on the wrist for failure, and can just try again quickly. This makes every monster a practice in trial and error, to the point where it feels like you're dancing with them.

Every mission is unique in a way that makes the grind feel refreshing. Maybe this time you'll see a turf war between a monke and a t-rex. Maybe this time you'll get that firecell stone or novacrystal you've been missing. Maybe this time you'll fight a monster in a completely different biome than usual. Maybe this time you'll get that DAMN chaos emerald you've been grinding for the last few hours. Maybe this time you'll sever the tail. The gameplay loop is beautiful, and always keeps you coming back for more. There's always more materials you need, and there's always new experiences to be had.

The base story actually made me tear up near the end. Everything in the world feels hopeful, and captures the feeling of noblebright while not feeling cheesy. You're not on a quest to kill the big bad guy, just to act as a deterrent against monsters who, if left unchecked, would cause havoc and death. This isn't a story about good triumphing over evil, it's about  humanity protecting the world from invasive species and monsters that need to be checked. The stakes are high, but it never feels hopeless.

The music, good god the music. The rotten vale battle theme will probably get me through a physical fitness test I'll need to take soon. From teostra and the elder's recess to the big monke and raging brachydios, monsters each have thematically appropriate and menacing music to make everything feel like a boss fight.

The graphics are pretty good, especially for 2018. My only complaint there is that certain monsters' abilities can blend in with the environment and make dodging and evading more difficult. Looking at you, iceborne. Combat has an incredible level of variety, with 12 weapons to choose from that each have completely different playstyles. Each one has a niche in both solo and multiplayer hunts, from supporting your comrades with the bowguns or being an agile fighter with dual blades or the insect glave, to being a one man wrecking machine with a hammer or greatsword. The depth increases replayability even more.

My biggest complaint is the subspecies, with a few exceptions. It's just the same monster with entirely different materials to pad out the grind while not feeling like you're just fighting the same monster again. It could be worse, but I don't like all the variations of rathalos or rathian, nor the jyuratodus variants. The exceptions are, unfortunately, near the end of the DLC.

9/10, made me love gaming again. I'm a police officer in training so I don't have a ton of time to play outside of the weekend, but I can just pound out a few hours responding to SOS flares or grinding for another piece of gear. Get the DLC too, it changes the game and adds probably another 400 hours of playtime to it.

...I'm barely more than 10 hours in the game and I'm really bored.

First of all the game is not a roleplaying game, it's a hack 'n' slash with some rpg elements. Most stat increases come from gear, but it doesn't get too crazy. You won't be able to one hit the first boss enemy type no matter how good your stuff is.

The combat is really polished and it looks amazing + there's some cool combos and mechanics, but it's always the same loop. You find the monster, you hit it till it runs away, you follow after it, you hit the monster till it runs away and so on until it's finally dead. The combat feels more tedious than fun.

It's not really an open world to explore, it's rather a series of tunnels that lead to the same points. It's filled with a wild variety of enemies and plants, but it somehow still feels empty. There's not really anything to explore.

I just have a hard time finding something to keep me coming back here. It doesn't really do exploration, I can't level up my character, the gear won't get much stronger, the story is painfully boring and the combat tedious.

[The game runs somewhat good on Steam Deck, but it will drain your batterie in 1,5 hours. You really have to lower the settings to have an efficiant, rather than good experience. I don't think it deserves the verified status though.]",1699392009,1706955900,False,1,0,0.35772356390953064,2,True,False,False

The combat is solid, monsters are excellent, hunting is fun and all optional side activities are non-intrusive enough to let the core gameplay shine. I can easily see how Monster Hunter (W) can be the favorite game/genre of many people, and I would certainly reccomend it to anyone to try at least once! 

Personally however, I don't think I will be playing much longer. Though (most of) the monsters so far are fun to fight, they don't require unique strategies, the fights usually play out the exact same way every time. Sure, every monster has some kind of weak point or weakness, however exploiting that (usually elemental) weakness requires grinding many different weapons, which I simply don't find fun. The monsters themselves also get old relatively quickly, and with how long many fights last and how few random rewards they give, fighting them also feels grindy after two or three kills. I know that this is the basic premise of the game (hunt, grind and master bosses), and I guess it's not for me.",1706890415,1706890516,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, I suddenly changed my mind after playing this game since the first step, and there is no doubt why most players love this game so much. 

Pros
- If you are the one who loves detailed game design, this game is your answer.
- Not too much grinding.
- Pleasant graphic design.
- Cross game events.
- Double fun if play with your friends.
- Good overall gameplay performance.

Cons
- It could be a bit exhausting if you need to hunt the same monster over and over for a material.
- Online session disconnect. (Rarely)
- Chasing down the monster is too far sometimes.

Ingredients:

1 cup plain flour
2 tablespoons caster sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon bicarbonate of soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup buttermilk
1/4 cup milk
1 large egg
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup fresh blueberries (or frozen, thawed)
Butter or oil for cooking
For the Maple Drizzle:

1/2 cup pure maple syrup
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
Instructions:

Mix the Dry Ingredients:
In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda, and salt.

Prepare the Wet Ingredients:
In a separate bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract.

Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:
Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and gently fold them together until just combined. Be careful not to overmix; a few lumps are okay.

Fold in Blueberries:
Gently fold in the blueberries, distributing them evenly throughout the batter.

Heat the Griddle or Pan:
Preheat a griddle or non-stick pan over medium heat. Add a small amount of butter or oil to coat the surface.

Cook the Pancakes:
Pour 1/4 cup portions of batter onto the griddle for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface, then flip and cook until the other side is golden brown.

Make the Maple Drizzle:
In a small saucepan, melt the butter for the maple drizzle over low heat. Add the maple syrup and stir until well combined. Remove from heat.

Serve and Drizzle:
Stack the pancakes on a plate, and drizzle the warm maple sauce over the top.

Optional Toppings:
Customize your pancakes with additional toppings like whipped cream, more fresh blueberries, or a sprinkle of icing sugar.

1. Better Graphics.
Rise was made exclusively for the Nintendo Switch. By default it's graphics are gonna be sub-par.
World, and ESPECIALLY Iceborne, look and sound far better than Rise could.
Especially the particle effects.

2. Immersion.
Rise is too much like your traditional ""Anime-with-filler-somehow-worse-than-bleach's-filler"".
From the stupid noises when your cooking raw meat, to having an unbearably catchy bunny-dango song whenever you wanna eat at the dango shop.
Can't get immersed in it myself.
World does it for me tho. More properly-done realism, less in-your-face fantasy.

3. Harder monsters + Wirebug cheesing.
Anjanath is a nightmare in World. In Rise he's a little baby. But only cause you can use wirebugs.
Wirebug abilities and Switch Skills are cool. But they give too much of a bonus to the point where the game becomes easier the more decorations you get.
The switch skills and weapon abilities should've been part of World + Iceborne, but been dumbed down HEAVILY to not do so much damage.
I say as even with Wirebugs I couldn't beat a 6 star Zinogre without fainting twice with a Magnamalo Longsword.
Speaking of which.
4. Weapons.
Every weapon feels so much more impactful with each hit - without being absolutely broken.
Insect Glaive was my main in World, but I do variety now.
In RISE it's one of the most broken weapons in the whole game thanks to wirebugs, switch skills and double air-dashing.
The Hammer's Flip-Jumps are less rare and more common thanks to wirebugs, which I was bothered by at first but came to love after replaying world.
The Long Sword's Sephiroth Omni Slash wirebug skill was satisfying, I'll admit. But wirebug countering? Now you're just pushing it.
The Dual Blades are what got me through most of the beginning game cuz of wirebugs.
And the Sword and Shield are what got me through first-time Magnamalo.
Monster Hunter is supposed to be hard enough to make you scream ""YEASS! SCREW YOU ZINOGRE!!"" At the top of your lungs and do a bully maguire arm-rolling dance like I did in 6 star. 
With Wirebugs I was just ""Yes! Screw you..!""

Only Wind Serpent Ibushi got me to do that ... without the happy dancing.

But come Zinogre in World - Master Rank and I'll be doing that.

See you on the hunt. May the Sapphire Star light your way.

The monster's AI is very good and it has vast complex biomes that feel natural and full of life.
It is very beautiful, but... that's all it has going for it.

It feels dated, it feels clunky.
All of the monsters feel very weak and easy to kill. Even the Elder Dragons feel dated in comparisons to Rise's versions of them, which have better animations and more showy attacks.
You will spend 15 minutes on a map trying to find the monster & kill it in under 5 minutes, unless it runs away, so you can spend another 5 minutes tracking it again.
Making weapons, upgrading weapons, is an absolute nightmare to navigate.
Joining friends early game is a terrible experience, but it gets better once you hit high rank missions.
The Handler is constantly talking, I can not stand her.
You can not skip cutscenes.
The forced Expeditions are very annoying to deal with, but they seem to be early game only.
The camera jerking to look in a direction is awful. This happens when you find prints or walking into the targets zone. It's disorienting. If you are in the middle of fighting something and your target shows up, the camera zooms towards your target. It can get you hit, or even killed.

If you have experience with Monster Hunter games and know the clunky feel of the older games, you will like this game.
I personally prefer the Quality of Life improvements that Rise brought - even if that means sacrificing the beautiful alive environments that World has.

If you're someone who just wants to drop in, kill monsters, drop out - get Rise.
I would highly recommend Rise to someone who is new to the Monster Hunter series. It is incredibly beginner friendly with some very hard late game monsters.",1704254841,1706726028,False,1,4,0.450227618217468262,0,True,False,False

[h3] Pros [/h3]

[list]
    [*][b]The World:[/b] The games maps are very densly designed and thriving with live. Almost everywhere you can find bigger friendly herbivores, small critters and bugs as well as small animals you can use to help you hunt such as poison toads and the likes. This leads to the atmosphere being really great.
    [*][b]The Combat:[/b] The combat feels very satisfying. Every hit feels meaty without the weapon being clunky. There are many combos and monsters to learn. Positioning and knowing the monster is as important as knowing your weapon just like in every monster hunter before. For reverence: I mostly played Gunlance and Hunting Horn in World. Gunlance especially felt really satisfying with just perfect soundeffects and enough hitlag after every hit. Hunting horn also had a really great system for its notes where you can chain multiple notes and play an encore after that strenghtens the before applied buffs.
    [*][b]Immersion:[/b] The game really immerses you in its game world. You really feel like a hunter tracking your prey with your scoutflies
    [*][b]Scoutflies:[/b] These are a method to track the monster that has been the best one yet. You find footprints and other tracks of the monster. These lead you to other tracks until eventually the monster's location gets revealed to you. After you hunted the monster enough times the amount of tracks you have to collect before this happens gets reduced more and more. Scoutflies are not perfect, but definitely a step in the right direction.
    [*][b]Investigations:[/b] Investigations are randomly generated quests you get by breaking monster parts and collecting tracks. They can be multi-monster-hunts and can have different time limits or amount of carts. The more difficult the quest the better the reward. 
This leads to a system that makes farming for monster parts more interesting than just spamming the same quests over and over. 
The only thing I don't like is the random player cap. Sometimes you get quests just 2 player can join. This is bad when you want to play coop with friends and I can't wrap my head around this decision.
    [*][b]Gorgeous armor:[/b] The armor designs in world are really good and are all quite different. Some of the best imo are [spoiler] Pukei Pukei, Kulu Yaku and Anjanath [/spoiler]
    [*][b]Good Monsters:[/b] World has pretty good monsters across the board. A majority of MHW's roster is new and well designed. The game even threw in multiple new elder dragons.
[/list]

[h3] Cons [/h3]

[list]
    [*][b]The infinite restock:[/b] In MHW you can always go to the camp during a hunt and restock all your health potions and other items. After playing some of the older games I am sad to see the ressource managment side of the games go away. You lose out on all the decisions that go into preparing for a hunt with limited inventory space like: 
Are 10 mega potions enough? Should I take stuff with me to craft more during the hunt? Do I want a trap and tranq bombs? Do I need max potions and an ancient potions? Do I also need ressources to craft those if they run out? Do I need cold/hot drinks?
This may sound tedious to some, but it really added something. This could have fitted world really well especially with the faster gathering of herbs and the like, but the presence of these infinite restocks takes this and the ""war of attrition against the monster"" away. This also leads to the engame having quite a few monsters with ""nuke-moves"", because chipping damage won't kill you, but those moves were actually more a problem in the DLC Iceborne and especially the DLC of MHW's sequel.
    [*][b]Cutscenes:[/b] The cutscenes are good the first time you see them. They become a problem on second playthroughs as you cannot skip them. The worst thing about them is how they make playing through the game with a friend tedious as you both have to watch them in singleplayer and just then you can join the other persons mission. In the DLC's engame are even some missions where you both go in the same mission and then both watch the same cutscene where both of your hunters are present, so they showed that the games cinematic approach can work! Why not do it like this from the start?! 
    [*][b]Weapon Designs:[/b] To be honest, most of worlds new weapon designs suck. They are just the base weapon with some monster parts slapped on.
    [*][b]Monster Variety:[/b] While I think the majority of MHW's roster is great by themselves, sadly most of them use the same skeletons. You will fight Lizards, T-Rex-ish monsters, flying monster and 4 legged dragons. Older games had simply more variety with spiders, snakes, leviathans and insects. This is not a huge problem for me, but still sad to see.
    [*][b]Gathering Hub:[/b] Now we are in the small nit-picks territory. The gathering hub is not really great. It lacks most of the shops a hunter needs like the gardener, smithy and Argosy. This leads to having to leave the hub frequently or just playing from the main hub without seeing your friends in the base, which is sad to see, especially because the gathering hub itself looks really beautiful.
[/list]

Overall World is really good despite its flaws and definitely worth your time. I really love this game even though I ranted quite a bit about its shortcomings, but this is just because I learned to love the franchise from the point I played World as my first Monster Hunter game in 2021 and want it to improve. 

The Iceborne DLC brings a lot - and I really mean a lot, it doubles the amount of content the game has - of new content to the game and is a must have in my opinion.",1706714310,1706722414,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Choosing your elegance in the realm of weapons has been a dance of power and finesse. In the symphony of strikes, your continuous DPS prowess is a testament to the beauty of continual damage, a ballet with the titans. The artistry in your moves, like the descending thrust and jumping advancing slash, transforms each encounter into a dance. The way you allow me to follow monsters, dealing substantial damage thus, creates a sensation of dominance, making me feel truly formidable. Insect Glaive, you are not just a weapon. you are a masterpiece, a captivating partner in the dance of hunting.

its alot of fun at first, but as you progress even if you have all the top gear maxed out, you're using all the boost, and items and the correct ailments and elements for the monster it still doesn't matter. it gets to a point where its harder then a dark souls game. at least in those games you have a chance, or there's something to learn. here the monsters dont follow any pattern, and get so strong that you are basically stun locked until you die. no chance to dodge or block. you just get to sit there for a few mins and watch as your guy frustratingly just stumbles around , or gets stunned or gets pushed to the ground repeatedly. it even feels like the i-frames for a dodge become non-existent. and the monsters attack radius will extend well beyond the swing of its tail or bite.

Play with friends! Don't have those? Its okay I don't either You can play with strangers! Don't like strangers You can play alone!  You're a eight limbed space demon from mars?

For example: Stun, attacks have a random chance to stun you and that basically means death, so your life depends on chance. I understand that some attacks do that, but sometimes you just get hit by an inch of a foot from a monster and still get stunned -> Dead if it doesnt lose focus on you
Also if you dont have any friends you can totally forget to accomplish anything in late game and trying to hunt the last monsters inevitiably ends with whole party dead after 5 mins. It has good graphics and nice designed levels, but thats about the only thing. Also you will need to buy the expansion for the same price, cause the base game consist of 20% of the gameplay and that expansion will just make everything worse I have just stated. Introducing the Clutch Claw, if you like it or not doesnt really matter, some do some dont, but even if you do, like me, its mechanic is totally unfinished and makes no sense at all. You need to push monsters into a wall and sometimes they just run by, even when facing it turn around and just kill you, that means DEATH btw... Its more frustrating than anything else, even if you get used to the mechanics, which are not at all beginner oriented, you´ll still keep dying to random chances or a different monster just comes up, doesnt get repelled by dung pods and then have fun getting your combos done. If you want a monster hunter experience, just play some of the copies theyre way more thought through and playerbased.

it's amazing, what got me was the ""world"", the enviroment, the many ways you can proceed with a hunt, traps, and endemic life, although I don't like the ""scout flies"" system the other parts are realy good, like the highligt of tracks and things you can take, because sometimes those things are really hard to see without some type of highlight.
The clutch claw coould be beter, still the new moves are amazing, adds fluidity to te combat overall.
still with the things that need polish, the game is really good, i recomend it completly

There is a learning curve and plenty of grind, so if you like that sort of thing this game is a good fit. There are tons of monsters to hunt and countless hours to spend in this title. Hundreds of weapons, armor, collectibles, cat armors and cat weapons, house decorations, and more to explore. I'd give it a 9 in terms of content, gameplay, and graphics. The story is lackluster, but that's not the appeal of this series anyways. You're not missing much if you just skip through dialogue. The game is best when grinding and hunting with friends.

Lavish & deathly exciting at practically all times - varied and expressive social MMO tissue connecting its numerous multi-layered terrariums of gorgeous arenas and silly monsties.

I do have some background with the series, with much history on Freedom Unite, and far less with the fantranslation of Portable 3rd + 3Ultimate at various points through highschool, and hit the credits of Rise. Freedom Unite came packed with FMV cutscenes that demonstrate how the monsters lived in their downtime - characterising the monsters to assure the player that they weren't merely thoughtless models with movesets to memorise, but individual links in the food chain with roles that keep the world biodiverse & strong.
It was always my favourite part of the game, and what felt like the series' missing hook to really sell me on the core conceit was in how this aspect is somewhat downplayed or unexplored.

By God's grace this was the kind of ecological focus MH:W absolutely relishes in. An interlinking tapestry of ecosystems ticking away, living & interacting in countless ways to make the New World feel so gd raw. And it's not just pageantry either, it plays into behaviours and environment interactions from traps to turf wars. So so so good to head out for a simple hunt to watch it blossom into a scrappy mess of tooth & claw, so so so good to go on aimless expedition to a zone and notice a new handful of behaviours from their endemic life. I’d not be able to sleep at night if I didn’t compliment the chefs on all of this, every monster in every zone is given so much purpose it’s inspiring.

One thing this series has always been great at is its environment design - the world of Monster Hunter is a land of plenty, and everything is blown out of proportion to match. You're eating sirloin steaks the size of your head, oyster side dishes that can feed an army. The tooth you built your hammer out of can sink a ship. Zones and skyboxes that coil across different unique biomes rich in visual stimuli, adding heaps of context for the world and how things are as they are. Pan the camera up at any point and you can assuredly see a spire of choral, ice or crystal towering over you from what appears to be a mile away. Hoarfrost Reach is gorgeous I need to live there NOW.

Moment to moment combat is of course good as hell. I love that it’s slow and weighty enough to separate it from a more typical Capcom character action affair. Even with the amassing layers of QoL the series has glazed itself with, World still focuses on hefty player move commitment and punishment. Every weapon here feels great and each individually recontextualises your approach to any fight, but I found a home with the Dual Blades I’m afraid. I love these stupid ale blades man!!! Basically adored the progression right up until the Furious Rajang, where the game takes a very steep swerve into grind and Raid-like Design territory I find catatonic & diagnostic.

Every time I make a review I give a TL:DR so here it is.

You are fighting Monsters. Then you use the materials to craft stronger monsters. So far so good. This game is kind of an action RPG but you don't gain level. Your character does not increase in strenght or HP or otherwise. Your progression is A: your weapon & armor but also B: your skill. 
One thing new players often misunderstand is how armor works in this game. 
You have skills on your armor. Like for example higher damage. 
You can upgrade the armor and slot gems in that also provide skill improvement. 
But upgrading the armor does not give more skills, it only increases armor value. 
More on that at *(1)
If you played Dark Sould you know what I mean. 
If you liked Dark Souls you might like this game. If DS was too hard for you, you still might like this game. It is much more forgiving. If you hate challenge in games at all, don't want to improve and just get a happy joyride easymode then this game is absolutely not for you. 

You can play and enjoy this game perfectly fine in single player. However it is a Multiplayer game. There is an issue here though more on that at*(2)

Unfortunately this game uses Denuvo.

World is one of, of not my favorite game of all times. The expansion is even better IMO except for the clutch claw. More about the clutch claw in my Iceborn review.

The Long review.

World is the 5th game in the series. 
The previous entries where slower and more methotical. However in this game they went for a more actiony approach. 
Therefore monster move much faster. But you do too. 

The game is also more story driven and more catered the a western audience than previous games in the series. 

(1) In this game you need to figure out what kind of skill you want to use that works well with your playstyle. 
For example, if you use weapons that can block attacks, you might want to use skill that decrease damage when blocking. 
If you want to play glass cannon you want to use skills that improve your damage.
There are many different sets of skills.
You can play as a healer by using the skills wide range for example, what it does is that if you heal yourself by drinking a potion, all other hunters in your team get healed as well.

(2) If you want to play with a friend through the story missions, you can do that. 
But when you meet a new monster during the story missions you get a cutscene. 
The problem is that someone at Capcom thought it is a good idea to not let anyone join in on the hunt before the cutscene has played.
So if you and your friend both start together, you must each seperately start a solo hunt, then both of you have to find the place where the cutscene triggers, then one of you has to abandon his hunt in order to join the other players hunt. 
This is annoying af. I played like this with a new player, I had to wait in the Guild hub until he watched his cutscene every time. 

Let's talk about bugs. 
And here we have an elephant in the room so to speak. 
The game is mostly pretty bug free. Yes some do occur, here and there.
However. There is one bug that is a serious problem and has never been fixed as far as I know.
And that is the ""you get kicked from your party when you faint/cart"" bug. (Carting is Monster Hunter lingo for fainting)
Sometimes when you or a teammate carts (in online multiplayer), the game freezes for a short 1-2 seconds or so and you or that teammate will be removed from the team.
This is not a teammate kicking you for fainting. I think this is a problem with some denuvo anti cheat but not sure about that.
When that happens to you it puts you into offline mode for whatever reason.
You are still in the hunt, just now alone. You can rejoin online play after finishing the hunte or abandoning it. 
However. If you were in a 4 player hunt, or the hunt was only for 2 player to begin with, you will not be able to join back on that hunt. 

Lets talk about performance on PC.
You should have a decent pc. 
If you have to tune down the graphics with the very limited options for graphics available, monsters look like shit. 
The character models look fine, the enviroment looks fine. But Monster textures look terrible. 
Aside from that, I with my 7 year old budget PC was able to play in 60fps most of the time.",1542831270,1706493161,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

I never played more clunky and awfuly designed game before( maybe the first Witcher is close), the controls and animations are clumsy as heck. The battle mechanics are so emty,  its seems that your actions and attacks are totaly separated from the monsters you are hiting, no weight in the battle at all. Transactions between the scripted cinematics and when you gain control over your character are so unnatural, even the forced restrictions  of your contols in some scripted transactions are worst than to not have any control over your character. It's feels so forced and unnatural. The UI is nice, but not frendly for new players at all and that may be only my problem, but the stutering in the menues for me was beyond anyoing.  One other thing that i didn't like was the character of your ""handler"" (this term is all another issue), i get that Capcom wanat to make it mor anime feel. but she is just ayoing and stupid. And before someone jump and say i don't like female characters, just look how is done right in FF games or DMC or plenty of other games. Back to the battle mechanics - can't say enoght how dull they fill, ffs the mostly free to play GW2 have better mechanics than this  highly prased game.
Conclusion - it's not for me. End of the rant. 
issued refund after only 2 hr of play.

Also, there needs to be a weight slider. How do these people jump?

1. Steam only lets you return a game if you haven't played past the 2 hour mark. You'll spend half of that getting out of the tutorial.
2. Fat. Your characters are so heavy set it is distracting. I guess it fits the theme of ""I jump on big monsters with big things and go smash,"" but there's no athletic characters?
3. Did I mention it won't shut up? It won't shut up. You want to play a game, but you're stuck with story. Then more story. Did you move an inch? Story.
- Mind you, the story and animations and really the whole world is great, but at some point get your hands off me and let me touch it please.

I bought Dragon's Dogma years ago. Then ever played it. Exactly the same reasons. It just wouldn't shut up. It wouldn't get out of your face. And it wouldn't just let you play it. The only saving grace for that game is Bitterblack Isle. You can go there at level 1. THERE at least it will shut up, let you play, and leave you the heck alone. ALSO, you can be you. This game is super pretty, the animations are good, the art direction is excellent, but it won't leave you the heck alone. It won't get the story out of your face. And it won't shut up. Also, you can't be yourself in another world. You've got to be brunhilda the masher. 

Capcom really needs to get a grip on the openings. If you want to open a game this way do something like ""tutorial world"" and make it really clear ""this direction to the tutorial"". Otherwise ""this direction"" (in the environment) to get to the game. To get to my character. I know this is a game about monsters, but really I want to try some armor on first. To see what weapons are out there. To just... you know... GAME and BE in this other world. 

Argh.. First impressions of this game are ""no"". I'm sure there's something about 8 or 10 hours past the ""please let me return this game for a refund"" point, but this... is the ""Chimera Experience"" of Dragon's Dogma without as much character design choice.",1706375510,1706375510,False,0,3,0.403205513954162598,0,True,False,False

-) Very good optimizisation, This game run on a smooth 30fps on my core 8 generation i7, with 16 Gb ddr4 ram, without Dedicated graphic card
-) Very good online (It is very stable)
-) The combat is very good (it is very smooth even on 30fps)
-) The monster designed and the collaboration is very cool
-) The armor costumization for your player character and your cat is very good
-) The best ost for your room ( Private Lounge room)
-) You can capture small animal to put it in your room (very good)
Cons :
-) Astera (It is too big) and it doesn't feel like a monster hunter village
-) The ost of astera ( It is not a relaxing village music)
-) You cannot sleep on your bed (very bad)
-) The weapon designed is kinda lacking

Every hunt is like a boss battle that lasts a maximum of 50 minutes, but is more likely to last about 20-30 minutes. These fights revolve around learning to read the attack patterns of the monsters and playing around them. There is a large number of different weapon that have different playstyles and you can get skills from your equipment that can further influence your playstyle. Whether you want to deal a lot of damage, want to be a tank, someone who is fast and can easily dodge everything, want to support your team, use status effects to deal with your enemy or take them out from a distance it's all possible. 

Since most of the gameplay is max 50 minutes boss battles it is a great game for people who are looking for a game that they can play for short periods of time.

There is nothing quite like it.  I will attempt to cover the various aspects of this game that make it the perfect game for me, but to quickly summarize: meticulous worldbuilding, fantasy-zoology, the back-and-forth nature of the fights themselves, weapon specialization and skill expression, and the overall feeling of the “hunt” combine together to create an experience that is truly unmatched by any I’ve ever had in all my years of playing games.

1) Wordbuilding
Monster Hunter as a series has always done worldbuilding in what I consider to be the only correct way to do it in a video game: you must experience the world to understand it.  This is exemplified in looking at monster behaviors and their interactions with the world.  Monsters behave as real animals in this game, oftentimes ignoring you if they do not perceive you as a threat to their territory and engaging in activities that reveal more about the nature of their biology and their fights.  Watching Nergigante preen his spikes by violently rubbing them on the ground or Velkhana strut about knowing she is the ruler of the Hoarfrost Reach does more to relay to the player what they can expect of their fights and personalities than any amount of explaining can do.  The monsters and their respective environments tell you a lot about how they fight and their places in the food chain well before you fight them.

2) Fantasy-Zoology
Branching off of the monster behavior topic, this series hits a particular niche I have yet to find a good alternative to, something I like to call “Fantasy-Zoology”.  While many games in the action-RPG and Medieval (in terms of weaponry) genre lean fully into either realism or fantasy, this game creates a world that is decidedly fantastical but implores you to accept the rules of its world through self-imposed limitations.  There are the occasional god-like monsters to be sure – Kirin summoning lightening from the sky or Kushala spitting tornados come to mind – but in relation to the heights of fantasy other games might reach even these feel grounded.  The world is one in which the natural history of the planet is that of monsters, and many aspects of these beasts reflect those of animals in our own world.  You don’t need to wonder how Namielle spits water and electricity at the same time, you see it in the jellyfish-shape of her wings and the bioluminescence in her veins that reflects those of animals in our own world.  The monster live and behave by the very instincts animals in our own world do, carving out their own territories and niches and competing for resources even outside the watchful eye of the player characters.  It is a world that is lived in, and it scratches an itch that a child who grew up obsessed with dinosaurs and natural history spends a life-time trying to rekindle.

3) The Fights
I came primarily into this series from a background in Dark Souls and other FromSoftware games.  After coming off the initial high those games offer, I found it difficult to find a series that pushes the 3rd-person action RPG genre to the same heights.  Boss fights in those games are about observation and execution, not simply attaining the highest stats possible.  Spending time learning the enemy movesets in-and-out, mastering your own moveset, and responding in turn with a bit of personal flavor on the battle gives way to a unique combat experience that is tough but very satisfying to master.  Monster Hunter expands on that in ways even I never anticipated.  Every fight is a dance, one that is meticulously designed so that you must use the knowledge you’ve gained from the previous two points, i.e. observing the monster’s behavior and place in the natural environment to determine how you must approach each battle.  You are rewarding for identifying Diablos’ weakness to Screamer Pods when it is underground, for identifying Rathalos’ tail sitting closely to the ground when it flies allowing for a quick cut into a dunk, and for noticing that Deviljho cannot resist the urge to fight other monsters that come into its territory.  You can make use of environmental hazards, traps, consumable buffs, and even the divisive clutch claw to turn every disadvantage into an advantage, and this is even more pronounced when you have a full team of hunters with various skillsets and specializations.  All of this allows for a level of personal expression that takes an already fantastic fight into a phenomenal experience.

4) Weapon Specialization and Skill Expression
Speaking of skill expression, Monster Hunter uses the Golden Rule of good game design: less is more.  It understands there is beauty in simplicity.  Fourteen weapons may not seem like much, but in using a similar design philosophy to fighting games, each one provides such a unique and deep experience that picking up a new weapon feels like picking up a new game.  Using mobile weapons like Dual Blades or Sword and Shield allows one to dip in-and-out of battle, utilizing i-frames to dive through monster attacks rather than away, providing an experience similar to that of Dark Souls.  Conversely, some weapons like Greatsword and Lance require you to stand your ground, identifying safe-zones in monster attacks and positioning yourself for an incredibly satisfying punish.  There are ranged weapons for the run-and-gunners out there, weapons that fly, and weapons that have the mechanical complexity to their combos that fighting game enthusiasts will enjoy.  In short, there is something for everyone in this game, and it’s difficult to play it “wrong” when there are so many “right” options.

5) The Hunt
The mark of a great game is something I like to call the “Experience”.  This is a combination of the mechanics, the story, the music, the tone, the art design and everything else that goes into a game to create the “experience” or “feel” of a game.  Going back to Dark Souls, I fell in love with that series because of the experience of being a lone soldier in a dying world.  The games relish themselves in the feelings of the morose and the macabre, and you can feel the sad state of the crumbling kingdoms and fallen knights around you as you struggle to not simply be another Hollow in the great web of failure the world is spun from.  The game feels oppressive in every aspect from its mechanics to its music.  And while this is not a review focused on gushing about Dark Souls, it is necessary to understand this concept to understand why Monster Hunter’s actual “hunting experience” is so damn good.  Every point I’ve talked about thus far as well as those more artistic ones that I have not (namely color scheme and music) all work together to create an experience of a “hunt” that no other game series can match.  I understand many veterans believe the “hunt” feeling of the game has been lost from previous titles, as pre-quest preparation is not as big a focus in this game, but I believe the overall experience is alive, well, and thriving in this game.  When you observe a monster’s features, relate it to real world animals, use that to infer something about its natural place in the world, watch it interact with its environment and other monsters to see how it fights, then put your own knowledge and skillset with your chosen weapon into battle against that monster, using all the tools and resources you’ve gathered from your time in the wild, all of that feels like a true “hunt”.  You are the hunter, this is your prey, and the more time you spend studying it and its environment the more success you will have.

In conclusion, I’ve spent 1000 hours playing this game over the past two years and I’ll spend 1000 more engaging with its colorful cast of crazy crocodilian carnivores just to experience the joy of the hunt.  I hope to see all you hunters out there and in the Wilds when next we meet.

Happy Hunting!

Decorations farming is horrid but its not really necessary, just a min-max thing, so its not THAT RNG heavy.

The New World is an untamed wilderness where many powerful monsters roam free, and where researchers have been drawn to uncover new mysteries. The player takes the role of a Hunter, tasked to hunt down and either kill or trap monsters that roam in one of several environmental spaces.  [/h1]

[b]Enjoyable Hunting, Grinding, and the Community is Great. 

Gameplay - Great because it has many weapons and weapon movesets you can learn, several monsters to hunt, monster movesets to learn, tons of side contents, expeditions, multiplayer if u want to play with your friends but solo is preferable too if u want a challenge, and more. 

Difficulty - Challenging especially Iceborne (DLC) and the True Final Boss or Final Title Update will gonna beat the hell out of you until you lose your sanity but it's a relief and very satisfying if u defeated it.

Graphics - You'll forget what reality is.

Length - This game is long in Story but the length of what u can do in this game is 
""To infinity and beyond""

Sound Effects, Music, and Voice Acting - Eargasm except for ""The Handler"" because I want to punch my monitor every I hear her voice. (no pun intended)

Plot - Average but here's the example: A particular focus of the Expedition is to study Elder Dragons, powerful beasts that can affect entire ecosystems, and why they migrate to the New World every ten years in an event known as the Elder Crossing.

MHW is one of the best games I've ever played and is now My Favorite Game of All Time.

This is the first time I created a long-ass review because I love this game and of course MH Series as well.

MY RATING: 
Plot - 6/10           
Gameplay - 10/10                       
Enjoyment - 10/10
Overall - 10/10 for me [/b]

It really sucks to get constant framedrops no matter the texture setting or other graphics settings, whenever these things appear on my screen.

Otherwise the game is perfect.

Edit: I bought a good PC finally, so the above issue is no longer relevant with current hardware prices. But not only does this game not have proper graphic settings still, it also doesn't have controller mapping, which I have noticed now that I can actually play the game properly. Why? Could have at least gone the mile considering it has keyboard binds. Why is the attack button circle, literally every game I played thus far, Hades, Hollow Knight, MGRR, etc. all use square. Now I have to go through the painful experience of fiddling around with steams software to map it manually to my keyboard bindings. And that would not be too much of a hassle, if the cancel button wasn't on circle too and can't be switched to another controller button.

In my opinion, World/Iceborne remain the gold standard best Monster Hunter game. 
Pros: The maps are visually stunning, the monster variety and design is great (especially with the Iceborne expansion), and the combat system is engaging even after 1000 hours (on console). With 14 weapons that all function completely differently, there is a playstyle for nearly everyone. Even the minigames, like tracking down rare endemic life that you can then keep as pets, are engaging.
Cons: There is a learning curve to the game, some interactions are poorly explained, and the game does require a bit of grinding; but persevere and this is a top tier gem worth the time players can put into it.",1706213752,1706213752,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-Monster Hunter: World is my first ever Monster Hunter series that i play, it's fun and annoying at the same time, the story is really nice but at the same time the world is just beautiful, its very different from other open world games that i play.

-I have played 100 hours of base game and 200 hours of iceborne dlc (after 100 hours of base game, i decide to buy iceborne dlc) and i'll tell you, ice borne dlc is super buff game play for this game. Don't get me wrong, even without dlc i still play this game for 100 hours until i decide to adding dlc iceborne into the game.

-The mechanic is really fun, battle with monster that just massive is got me goose bump with some bangers music that playing on the background makes the battle just out of this world. 


-To beat the monster, you forced to use your surrounding things like stone to lure the monster to precies area for you and your party easier to fight the monster, grab some thunderbug and craft it into flashpod to make monster blind for a second, climbing the root to get to the top, even we got some raider ride to make the exploration easy.

-With so many mechanic on this game, on my first hour playing this game i just wanna quit and just call it a day, because it so much work and i don't even have another goal after beating one monster, but with some good story and some tips from my friends, i decide to continuing the game for few hours.

-With no experience of this game, i feel like you just confused because the fighting style is so slow and the mechanic is really something else, but i tell you, this game is so much fun if you playing with 2 to 4 people. You can learn from them how the game work, how the mechanic game that you never see make the game easy, and for some people with just present one person can never make this game boring, even with your silly friend that died every time or even you died evey time (well in my case died every time is extremely frustrating, but at the same time, it's makes me wonder what is wrong with that, it is because my lack of experience? is it because i got too close to the monster? or is it because i don't bring proper weapon? etc. With that much though's in my mind, it's make me want to become the better hunter and beat the monster even harder that before.

-If you can't handle the monster preasure, there's mechanic called SOS Flares, it will make your quest appears on SOS quest, but to use SOS Flare you have to Online and got connection to internet. When you launch SOS Flare, wait for some time and some people will come to help you finish the quest.

-For people that isn't used to grind on their gaming, this game isn't for you, BUT with dlc include on every begining of the game, you got set named ""Defender SET"" that will make your base game much easier until you can grind some decent. (this is plus point for me cause mos of the game that grind really hard almost didn't care about newbie that just got into the game, yet they really trying hard to beat the game, most of scenario they stay until finish the game, and the rest just gave up and leave the game).

 After buying Iceborne dlc, my playing experience has changed. i can't put all of my iceborne dlc experience in this review cause it's too much, but i'll write some big changes of my Monster Hunter: World experience so far:

-Clutch claw is really powerful tool that make your hunting so much easy that you cant get feel it on base game
-You can wounded the monster to get much easier big damage, makes your hunting faster to clear because monster have been wounded
-Some weapon got new stance, like Long sword got Iai stance make it so much better game play cause you can infinitely attacking without putting your sword down.
-More story and more maps that make your gaming experiences never end (this where end game begin)

 The game is so good that my laptop can't even handle it (i use rog from 2016 and it's very lag i barely got some decent fps, yet that won't stop me playing this game), Kill monster to get material for make better armor and repeat, that what people said. But for me, grinding material alone is not enough, I have been blessed with good friend and good mentor, and i will use my knowledge of the game to help people to go trough the game, or in my case helping people that use sos flare to finish the quest faster is my end game habit if i got nothing else to do, but still want to play the game.

 With some raising player on the end of December, this game is best to be play with more that one player so you can learn from them and make your game play interesting and fun.",1706197564,1706197564,True,1,0,0.528301894664764404,0,True,False,False

TL;DR - people against DRM are seething because their specs are garbo, game is fine

First off, addressing the DRM situation and the negative reviews relating to it; if you're having performance decreases that are actually impacting gameplay, your pc is probably outdated and shouldn't be playing ""newer"" games anyways (even though MHW launched in 2018 and isn't really that demanding). I can understand the issue with Camcom's stance on modding (QOL and Visual mods anyways, not game changing mods) but a lot of games and game companies are like that so... what difference does it really make? game is still playable and enjoyable as-is. 
Second. The actual game itself. Great game, great visuals, story is hit and miss but realistically the main point is monster genocide 
Spent a good amount of time in base world years ago, then eventually Iceborne. Not too difficult if you're not new to these type of games or especially any souls-like
Even then, learning the mechanics of the weapons and finding what works can be a challenge at first but eventually you adjust to the way things work. Then next thing you know, you're grinding endgame content hours on end.

Only REAL complaints I have are the abundance of sluggish animations that take forever to get through (and cant cancel either). As a greatsword main, of course being abysmally slow with attacks and combos in general are the bane of my existence but that's why timing is key. however theres just the slightest things that tend to irritate over time regarding slow animations. would take awhile explaining but if you know, you know. 
The other issue, as a completionist and achievement hunter, is the insane level of RNG it takes to actually get some of the achievements. It ends up being a chore especially for crown hunting. but if you're solely focusing on that, then obviously it takes the fun out of it instead of just letting it happen over time naturally (instead of solely farming for crown monsters for hours a day)

The combat can be tricky at first, but as you get the hang of it, you'll feel like a true hunter taking down massive beasts. It's so satisfying to see yourself land hits and take on tougher challenges with ease. Overall, it's a really fun and thrilling experience that you won't regret trying out!

The combat system has a learning curve, gradually increasing in complexity and leading to exciting encounters with various monsters. Taking down these formidable creatures and using their parts to craft powerful gear is a truly epic experience. Wearing your hard-earned trophies as items is a unique touch that adds an extra layer of excitement to the game.

Although I thoroughly enjoyed my solo adventures, the multiplayer aspect adds a whole new dimension to the experience. Hunting alongside fellow players, and sharing in the spoils of victory enhances the overall enjoyment of the game is one aspect I have missed and wished was more accessible. 

Monster Hunter World is an exceptional game that offers an immersive and exciting adventure. The game's world, mechanics, and the thrill of hunting make it a masterpiece.

Alas, the game has dozens of very anti-consumer micro-transactions (Such as having to spend real money to change the way your character looks, and locking several character cosmetics and house decorations with no in-game way to earn or unlock them). If you like games in the ""Hunting"" genre, then this is probably one of the best. However I refuse to endorse a game with such flagrant anti-consumer practices, in this game's case in particular it's incredibly egregious to me as the bulk of your play experience is grinding out gear unlocks... *except the ones Capcom wants to charge you extra for.*

The controls for mouse and keyboard are horrendous and the hardest to reprogram out of any game I've ever played. It took me 2 weeks and 100s of google searches to finally find clear enough information about how to rebind the sling so that it actually works, because the default setting for sling does not work on PC unless you have a basic 5 button mouse(which I do not), the ingame settings do not just say 'FIRE SLING', and even then theres so many other button problems with the default settings that the game becomes a nightmare to play. 

Also, the worst UI I have ever experience in any game ever. They just kept the garbage console UI and made no alterations to make it accessible for PC users. Systems upon systems piled up and no explanations how any of them work, and combined with such a horrible UI, makes for a STEEP learning curve. There is no excuse for such a piss poor porting of a game

Lastly I will talk about the combat. Combat is pretty mediocre. Animation locks with no mid-animation cancellation option, forcing you to commit to swinging wildly at the air often. Literally 2 button combat, which is super lame considering the game has combos, so a combo is literally just pressing 1 of the 2 buttons. Incredibly slow movement speed/turning speed. Game relies way too much on stuns for artificial difficulty instead of just programming better monster combat. The stuns are so rage enducing, that itll make you want to just quit the game. Even with stun reduction gear(which doesnt appear to work at all?), the stuns last way too long.

So why am I recommending this game despite having all these negative things to say?
1)its cheap. For the price, its a fun boss killing adventure. 
2)multiplayer VASTLY improves this game. Once you experience your first raid on a boss with others, you will understand why people love this game so much.

1: Multiplayer sucks. Imagine having to disband your party all the time, start a solo quest, get to a cutscene, quit, and then finally reform the party to play said level together. Whoever designed this game clearly wanted to showcase the annoying NPCS and NPC outfits as much as possible which imo is why they force you to play certain missions solo to unlock co-op.
Also the scaling of difficulty is bad for 3-4 players when for Solo / Duo you get invincible cat monsters to help you. 3-4 should have a few more revives imo.

2: Story is meh. This is one of the few games where I feel like I am the bad guy and I wish that I could play as the monster in order to annihilate the annoying npcs and npc cat monsters. The Quest Giver NPC I am convinced is an Evil Entity that was created purely to annoy me.

3: Game should be called ""Resource Hunter"" and not ""Monster Hunter"" because that is the game pretty much. Running around collecting resources before eventually bumping into the monster, having a spat, chasing after it while collecting more resources before finally killing or capturing the monster.

4: Game feels very grindy when it comes to all the materials and money that you need to upgrade items.

5. Combat feels rather repetitive and sometimes the hitboxes from monster attacks feel really off. Imo it would've been better if the game allowed you to switch between like 2 weapons so you can vary up the fighting - otherwise you'd have to run back to the box to switch weapons which would feel lousy.

In conclusion: due to the multiplayer experience rubbing me off in the wrong way I can't recommend this game because it isn't fun having to switch from solo to co-op for many missions. Since it was co-op that brought me to this game that is the biggest drawback for me. Solo? I can see the game being fine. Otherwise 2 player is probably the next best thing despite the same issue with solo locked mission cutscene skulduggery nonsense simply because you both get an invincible cat monster that can aggro the monsters without drawbacks.

Would recommend if I could feed the annoying colonising NPCS to the monsters.",1706039618,1706039618,False,3,1,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

This is easily one of my favourite games of all time and an introduction to now one of my favourite franchises of all time. I picked up this game back when it first released and it had a lot of issues with the online multiplayer servers which got fixed within a couple weeks. It's sad but most of the negative reviews for this game are for the initial connectivity issues. But anyway onto the actual review.

Most people read reviews to find out if anything is wrong with a game so after playing for 1,500 hours and earning all the achievements, here is what I believe to be wrong with this game with discussion based around those points.

[h3] Price / Playtime / Replayability [/h3]
First and foremost the price is always a hurdle with any of these AAA games. But I will say that despite the big price tag of not only the base game but also the DLC Iceborne, this game delivers with the amount of content it provides. The iceborne DLC is easily one of the biggest game DLCs I have ever found and played effectively doubling if not trippling the content of the base game. It's also worth mentioning that in both the base game and the DLC, after the story has finished there is a huge amount of end-game content to keep you attached for hours fighting new monsters, raids, events, new gear, etc.

[h3] Beginner Friendly? [/h3]
No. This is quite possibly the biggest issue with this game and there are a lot of aspects as to why it fails in this area. Let me first talk about the UI. The UI in this game is quite possibly the worse UI in such a successful game. It's incredibly unintuitive and trying to learn how to do anything can take hundreds of hours. People joke that the UI is a harder battle than the monsters in this game and it really is true for new players. You may not even know that loadouts exist for dozens of hours and then when you learn that they exist you won't be able to figure out how to register and use them effectively until another dozen hours. I've seen people say that the UI is designed this way due to it being first released on console and the intended experience being a controller but I don't think that gives it any excuse for it to be as unintuitive as it is. Unfortunately it's the product of a 20 year old franchise that hasn't changed its outdated systems all that much. It works once you know how it works but yeah.

The weapons and combat can be a struggle for new players too, there are some weapons that are more beginner friendly than others, I personally used one of the most complicated weapons (Charge Blade). I also want to clarify that complicated does not necessarily mean hard in this case. The Greatsword is a great- (hehe get it) example of this because its combos are very simple and you really only have 1 or 2 options of what you want to do, however the weapon is still challenging due to its slow mobility and the weapon is all about positioning and timing. Regardless of what weapon you pick, I highly recommend looking up some youtube guides for your weapon or asking a friend who has experience to teach you, else you will be struggling against the monsters without realising that you have a parry for example.

Another point regarding beginner difficulty is general items and consumables. A lot of new players don't quite understand just how important some of these items can be and it's one of those things that you'll only really learn through external feedback. A great example is flashpods which can be used against flying creatures to blind them so they fall out of the sky for a large damage window opportunity. A big thing in this game is capturing monsters which literally lets you finish the hunt when the monster typically only has 30% HP left (in the beginning). I could easily talk about items for a long time but you get the point. This game has tutorials but they're all useless. You will only learn from external sources.

[h3] Achievement Hunting [/h3]
If you're like me, you love to hunt for achievements. This game's achievements are... tedious. Obviously there are your basic ones like going through the story and killing 100 elder dragons or whatever, but the really difficult ones can take hundreds of hours. Monsters in this game don't have a defined size and instead appear on a sort of spectrum. If you're fighting a large version of a monster and you beat it, you'll be rewarded with a crown made from silver or gold depending on it's size. There are big gold crowns and small gold crowns and there are 2 achievements (4 if you count the DLC) which are to acquire every large and small gold crown in the game. Gold crown monsters have between a 3%-6% chance to spawn normally and you can up those rates by doing some event quests but it really is abysmal. But those achievements aren't even the worst ones, and I think that really just sums it up. If you want to achievement hunt this game then by all means do it, I did, but it will take over 1000 hours to do so, so I hope you enjoy your time :P

[h3] Is it a Souls-Like? [/h3]
This is a good question and it really comes down to what your definition of a souls-like is. Personally I don't think so and I'll lay out a few key differences as to why. Leaving behind the obvious gameplay loop differences (things like going back to retrieve your souls and checkpoints), the combat itself has a fair few differences. 

First off the lock-on. The lock-on in this game is atrocious and you might be tempted to use it at first but even on controller you are better off just turning your camera to look at the monster. It doesn't have any fluidity like Fromsoftware's carefully craft lock-on camera does, and just keeps the monster dead centre of the screen (If you don't know, Fromsoftware's lock-on camera dynamically moves where the lock on is placed on the screen based on your position in the environment. It also zooms out for larger monsters, etc.)

Let's look at iFrames (invulnerability frames). This game does have iFrames but they are no where close to what Dark Souls' iFrames are. In this game you are encouraged to roll away from an attack, block it, or counter it. You do have iFrames at the very very beginning of your roll and have hundreds of hours you could start to utilise it in some situations but I would never rely on it as a beginner. There is actually a skill called Evade Window which increases this size of this iFrame window so if you want to practice getting better at rolling through things then that would be something to aim for.

As for weapons there are 14 different weapon types including 3 ranged options, as mentioned previously, each of them is difficult in their own right and they all have different combos, abilities and nuances. It very possible to switch between any weapon type on the go so if you want to learn multiple at a time then I encourage it.

[h3] Conclusion [/h3]
I am obviously making this review 6 years after the game was released so there's not much I can say that hasn't already been said. But I think the points I've highlighted above should be a little more niche than your typical performance and graphical posts. Most reviews will tell you to play the game, as does this one. But I won't shy away from telling people that it's hard to learn, especially on your own. Do research. This game is far more enjoyable if you know what you're doing.

Happy Hunting everybody! I look forward to seeing everyone in Wilds!

EDIT: Just to mention DRM briefly. If people don't know, DRM is an anti-cheat software however for CAPCOM's purposes it's mainly used for anti-piracy. This is not a new thing with their games however people are talking about it due to a recent controversy surround street fighter. CAPCOM typically has a more expensive anti-cheat software in their games when they first release and then downgrade to a less expensive one after a few years. It's not something you should be worried about and it's not quite retro-active as people say it is.",1706020019,1706020403,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

(Probably the final update i do to this review after finishing both the main game and the dlc story 200 hours in with still a lot more to do.)

I love this game and i am super thankful that i finally went in head first while the sale was still on for those wanting a quick review YES get it even at full price both the main game and dlc are amazing the cosmetic dlc is just extra you don't need it but it is cool looking just as a small tip DON'T use the defender gear it'll ruin the fun.

I'll just say this again i honestly really love this game back near late December i was honestly not doing much i had plans but ZERO motivation to do anything. Then tga came around with some really good game announcements i don't watch tga due to really just not liking it but announcements are always good. Some games I've been waiting years for really got me exited and then monster hunter came round and with my mind in an already great spot after all that i decided to have a look at some of the games available.

I gave rise a shot back when it came out on switch but honestly it never clicked with me and well never buying it here because denuvo... so i look to world for my monster hunting needs and Capcom sure knew what i was up to with not just the lowest sale they've ever done for the game but also started posting small guides and doing community streams for new players and helping them by showing the first few fights in the game.

Before i knew it i was playing the game just honestly really immersed for the past few weeks monster hunter has been the only thing I've cared about the world is amazing not because of the graphics (though they are also rather good) but due to how it all moves. Big and small monsters fighting and running away due to fights just honestly a lot goes on just while you are walking around.

Talking about monsters. The monsters. ALL of them are amazing especially Brachydios he is the bestist. But honestly every monster is so varied and different even similar looking monsters can really trip you up if you fight them the same old way using different elements or really hindering you by yelling and causing you blights ( Status effects ) you really have to know your enemy if you want to not come out of a fight bruised battered and possibly on fire.

The weapons. Just like the monsters. VARIETY. Swords, Guns, Lances, Le hammer (Best weapon) and a lot more. All the weapons have upgrades some of the upgrades making the weapon look similar to a monster that you get the crafting materials from such a small detail but i LOVE when games do this. The weapons will seam VERY daunting at first especially if you are new but the game gives you a training area to test some of the weapons out right from the start even giving you the basic versions of each of the 14 weapons just take your time with each of them going and hunting some of the monsters in the first area helped me a ton.

Honestly don't think i can say more without spoiling the game for you i would recommend it to everyone because its just that fun the dlc can be a bit grind heavy so be aware of that but honestly the outcome from playing through it is very worth it.",1702945087,1705982335,True,1,0,0.527559041976928711,0,True,False,False

I tried it out on XBox when it came out and bounced off of it pretty fast. With the reveal of Monster Hunter Wilds and the big sale last year I decided to try it out again and now I'm in for good. Finished the story (including Iceborne) today almost 140h in and I still feel like I have only scratched the surface.

The basic loop of the game is that you hunt monsters (duh) and collect their parts to make new armor and weapons to hunt stronger monsters. This loop gets addictive as hell and if you get into it, you will hunt the same monster over and over again to complete the set.

The combat itself is more methodical than your average third-person action game. Animations are slow and generally leave you locked into the attack until it is done. So if you initiate a move that takes 5 seconds to complete when it is not safe, the monster may move out of your attack and attack you instead. So pick your openings for big attacks and stick to fast moves while the monster is still mobile.

The great thing about this combination of having to hunt monsters repeatedly and a combat system that rewards knowing how to read the monster's behavior is that you naturally get better at fighting the monsters. Nothing beats the feeling of having mastered a certain fight and absolutely bulling a monster that kicked your ass the first time around.

Some things that may bother you in the beginning:
   - The menus are not great. A basic UI/UX overhaul would be appreciated. You'll get used to them.
   - The game is not great at teaching you how each weapon works and I feel like most weapons have moves and tech that feel very much required for some of the harder fights. Watch the little videos on every weapon in game to get an idea of what you might like and then watch a tutorial for that weapon on YouTube.
   - There are two story-related missions that break the general loop described above. These SUCK. You'll know which I mean when you have to do them. Just sit them out.

All these negative points are truly nitpicks compared to the vast amount of top-tier content. Truly a Masterpiece.",1705950361,1705950361,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Adding DRM back to a game that has long been cracked makes no sense whatsoever. Capcom paid for the DRM solution and also paid a developer to implement it, to a game that is already CRACKED. All-time boneheaded move. Does literally nothing but piss off legitimate customers and scares away future customers. All you have accomplished is bad publicity. Congratulations, Capcom.

Old review: 
The best non-competitive game I've ever played. It's never a chore to play this game; even though I've collected and crafted every item in the game in 500 hours of play (minus a few AT Kulve Taroth weapons), I still find it fun to learn a new weapon and kill some monsters. The weapons are very unique and offer many different play styles. They are also very deep, and can get extremely technical if trying to learn meta for max DPS.

Incredible graphics, amazing score. I also like the story.

This game is easy to mod, which is fantastic. There are some great quality of life mods that make this game more enjoyable to play on PC over console.

Cons: The servers go down a lot during new events or AT Kulve Taroth. Extremely frustrating. I hope they work on disconnection issues for Iceborne.

The only other problem I have is a minor one, and that's Bazelgeuse's behavior. It is too predictable and thus just becomes a stupid annoyance. If he is on the map while doing an investigation and you initiate a fight with another large monster, he will show up to interrupt you 100% of the time (assuming he can get to that part of the map). This means you have to dung him, every time. It's not a big deal, it's just annoying that Bazel's behavior never changes or has any randomness to it.",1561782219,1705949119,False,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I think the reson I bought this game was because it was missing all of the BS from modern games. I like overwatch, I like battlefield, but I love this game for being a whole complete game, that set out to make an old series of games better. Older fans of the series hate certain aspects of this game and I understand that. I didn't like ds3 when it came out originally. But this game made so many QOL improvements that I can't imagine going back to older games anymore. 

I don't think this game is easier or harder than previous games. But I do think its different. Very few monsters have combo moves that are guaranteed to kill you. But many late game monsters have oneshot kill moves. I think many old fans find this game easy because they are used to dodging attacks, because many attacks in old games would lead to a combo death.

Contentwise, this game is longer than most mainstream games, but its also shorter than older games. Not many modern games will have this much content, so I won't complain.

Honestly, play this game. Most of the networking issues are either resolved or being resolved. Play with friends too, although admittedly, they really should change the way the cutscenes work. Either way, have fun.",1535905025,1705934597,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I was 50+hours into it before I realised my switchaxe has two guages, seriously just watch tutorials to avoid needless frustration. Often you´ll need gear to fight certain monsters properly, grind it first, not being equiped properly is the source of a lot of frustration. I´ll give you the example of me trying to farm nergigante ( highly agressive elder dragon ), I wasn´t equiped with a weapon that had elderseal or exploited a weakness of his. To make matters worse my armorskills were all over the place, it was disgustingly frustrating to fight this thing on my own. Now I have farmed for the armor I needed and have a new weapon that exploits his weaknesses to some extent + has high elderseal. It´s pretty easy after this, save yourself the headache and look it up first. it´ll take you 10 hours to figure it out on your own.

Enviroments are gorgeous and easy enough to navigate, a variation of smaller animals roam the lands, it feels alive no remarks there. Even your headquarters look awesome and everything you need is right where you want it. The monsters are impressive, especially in turf wars, the first time seeing a rathalos ( flying monster ) just plain picking up an anjanath ( t-rex land monster ) and dropping it on the ground for massive damage was amazing.

Now the combat, it´s my first game out of the Monster Hunter series and honestly I expected the combat to be more fluid. I have to admit, so far I only have experience with the switchaxe wich is a heavy weapon by all accounts. It´s just realy difficult to play reactive, you can´t weave combo´s and dodge monsters at the same time. Sometimes the monsters can just charge, run you over and then start stunlocking you. You don´t survive 10 seconds of not being able to do anything in this game, it´s frustrating dying like this, it doesn´t really feel fair.  

I´m 50 hours into this and my gear is still crap, I´m struggeling to get trough. Dark souls gives you a sense of achievement when beating a boss because you can simply try again without having lost anything. Here you have to farm up what you spent trying to kill something that guts you with 1 attack. You can´t play reactive because everything stunlocks you and the weapons limit your mobility greatly. Half the time you´re running around the monster with your weapon sheated hoping for a gap so you can heal. Then when you take a swig of your potion it turns around, looks at you from half way across the map and then jumps you. Taking a potion will also limit your mobility and it heals you gradualy. I´d say it takes about 2,5 seconds to down and it draws monster aggro so if you need to dodge or get hit you´ll lose half the potion + take the damage the monster dealt. This is the reality when fighting on your own, having multiple people to hunt with greatly improves the experience.

Would I recommend it? It´s not for everyone I can tell you that much, casual playing isn´t an option, you need to grind for gear to take on bigger monsters. If you´re not willing to put in a huge amount of hours to finish a lackluster story then don´t buy it. It is time consuming and a lot of RNG, you can manipulate what the monsters drop by breaking certain parts but when you need gems... Good luck, decorations are even worse.

EDIT : After 600 hours I still loath the day the clutch claw was introduced, its mechanics are so damn janky and the entire Iceborne DLC is balanced around it.

It goes : 
1. Mantle up and tenderize the monster part you´re looking to attack 
2. yeet it into the wall wich downs the monster and use the opening for damage
3. Run around like a moron becuase now the monster is enraged and hyper agressive.

Repeat when no longer enraged. The claw made the game so much worse.

 Arch Tempered Velkhana, Alatreon and Fatalis are the 3 cherries on top of the shitcake. Besides dealing absurd amounts of damage, enough to one shot you, they have mechanics requiring you to break certain parts, a damage check to avoid a one shot, a plethora of blights and/or a 30 minute time limit forcing you to play and slot decorations agressively. Soloing these fights feel entirely unfair and they´re not doable with randoms, they cart in the first phases. I´ve beaten these monsters and never intend to do them again, it is not ""challenging"" it is frustration beyond belief.

The mechanics, the monsters are huge, there are so many armour choices, descriptions etc. and it can be overwhelming at first. You'll die a ton until you learn your groove in Astera. Find the weapon that best suits you, get some armour, collect those scout flies and start fighting everything in your way. You can't get good at this game by standing in base.

I love this game. Not much else I can add to it but that.

[h2] The good [/h2]

- The combat. The simple to pick up, yet complex to master weapons really make this combat system shine. It's a very methodical game that puts heavy emphasis on positioning, timing and knowledge. While still feeling snappy and precise when you need it to be.

- God tier soundtrack. Listen to the theme of Raging Brachydios, Fatalis, Nergigante, Safi'jiiva or really most monsters in the game. It's some of the best orchestral soundtrack you could find in a game.

- Stunning visual design and animations. I legitimately spent hours on end watching background events and even walking through areas. This is a beautiful game. If you can run the game with the HD texture pack, please do so. It only makes an already great looking game look even better.

- Great endgame. The Guiding Lands are a great way to encourage further playtime and cooperation, while not feeling too overly grindy.

[h2] The bad [/h2]

- The jewel grind can get tedious sometimes. I legitimately grinded for hours on end and never quite got the jewel I needed. Even with the jewel farming quests. That said the later updates amended that a bit.

- Clutch claw is a system mechanic that nerfs weapons. My beloved insect glaive got absolutely butchered by this change. Not only is my damage already comparatively low to other weapons, now I have to tenderize twice with the clutch claw to reach my full damage. Amended a bit with shaver jewel, but it could have been implemented better.

- The netcode is shaky. Several times where I played perfectly fine in co-op with a friend our connection just died. Even though all other co-op games we played didn't have this issue.

- You can't play story quests co-op until you watched a specific in-quest cutscene. This was just really annoying, I desperately wish this wasn't a mechanic in the game.

[h2] My conclusion [/h2]

These gripes are very minor overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my time with this game and will recommend it to anyone who is interested in playing it. An amazing addition to Capcom's library. Now go out there and start hunting, Fatalis awaits you at the end of the road.

6/10 There are still some good and cool things in the game but it doesnt feel worth the time. The feeling that im wasting my time doesnt go away, maybe it just isnt my type of game.

Hopefully MH: Wilds will be better, and not have as much grinding and perhaps add one-shot-protection on certain damaging things like bazelgeues bombs, things like that interrupt the flow of the game and hurt the experience. I also hope that MH: Wilds story is better, I didnt feel invested in the characters and the story. God I wish MH: Wilds isnt as clunky as MH: World, it felt like my character was a complete retard 70% of the time.

Changing the firefly mechanic would also be greatly appreciated, it just feels annoying.

Story - Junk, only one good part was the cameo

Combat - Good for awhile but gets boring and repetitive. Lots of weapons but honestly they all kinda suck. Especially when you get into master rank stuff due to the monsters movesets, aggression, flight, etc etc.

Monsters - Low Rank and High Rank monsters are sort of fun to fight, again gets repetitive as fuc

Monsters - High Rank monsters are aids to fight, constant spam attacks, some skills will one shot you (lame as FUC). They look cool as hell though.

Weapons - Decent, some feel fun, some feel awful, some feel bleh.

Crafting - Dont like the system very much. Could be way better.

Materials - Takes awhile to get some stuff, requires repetitive play

Mods - Awesome, fixes most of the crap in the game.

Npcs - Annoying, Lame, Dumb, Talkative

Cats - Lame

Multiplayer - Lame system, not steamlined at all

Expeditions - Lame due to monsters timing out, but fixed with a mod

Quests - 3 feints is most you get, most time you dont need them but in master rank there will be times you wish you had more. Doesnt increase when in multiplayer so randoms can use them up and fail mission

Cutscenes - forced fed junk, no skip without mod

Im at the end of iceborne atm and ill have to say the base game is the most fun. Iceborne is just a bunch of crap. Cold zone is cancer with its constant stamina depletion and the need to drink hot chocolate. Fire zone doesnt seem to be as bad drinking cold milk once in awhile. Iceborne monsters are not fun to fight but cool to look at. They all have too much HP, seem to stay perma enraged, movesets can be atrocious for most weapons.

Do not buy at full price. Wait for sale, then you can have some fun for awhile until you move on to another game or no game.

The game wants you to micro manage you loadouts per monster but fuc all that. No one has time to craft half of the games gears, figure out all the skills per gear, theory craft all you sets, create loadouts etc etc. I just blunt forced my way through fairly easy with 1 -3 weapons and 1-2 sets of gear.

In short, MHW is not an easy game, but I think it is easily the best one I’ve played. It rewards patience and practice, and conquering a difficult monster is one of the most satisfying feelings in the world--before you inevitably hunt said monster into extinction because you need more of its teeth and a piece of its frontal cranium to stick on your funky hammer that looks like a bastardized axe for your own amusement.

TLDR: Demanding but highly satisfying learning curve for both weapons and monsters, diverse large maps to explore and environments to use to your advantage, attention to small details like capturing endemic life and thoughtful NPC interactions. 

I started out really badly, missing hits and getting whacked around constantly by even the earliest monsters. As an old Warframe player, the lack of mobility in MHW was quite jarring, shown by the countless times I’ve tried to dodge and failed miserably. 

After the initial battering, the next step is about perseverance, revisiting monsters to farm materials to get stronger armor and weapons. It’s an uphill battle, especially if you need to repeatedly do a monster that took 30 minutes and 2 faints the first time you tried. It’s about fighting the monster and yourself, as you really need to think one step ahead and pace yourself according to the enemy. 
The diverse range of weapons the MH franchise offers is no secret, giving players many different ways to fight the same monsters. In my opinion, every weapon is great and fun, and while it takes a lot of time to learn and master certain ones, it’s never a bad idea to have multiple main weapons to see you through different hunts. I love the insect glaive like nothing else, and I’ll die on this hill. (not literally) But for monsters that are more ferocious, I tend to approach them more cautiously with the lance or charge blade with their incredible mix of defensive and offensive capabilities, for example.

This journey of constant learning and relearning forms the bulk of my MHW experience, and even as I’m gearing up for the final boss I’m still working out the moves of monsters I’ve already conquered, and learning new weapons. I found this process of self-improvement to be the most satisfying part of the game, and something I haven’t been able to find in any other franchise to date. There’s no better feeling than greeting a monster like an old friend before you kick the shit out of each other, with a fast-paced fight that makes you feel almost invincible as you dodge, weave or just walk out of the way of attacks that used to rend the flesh off your bones.

MHW has seen me through some tough times as well, so the sense of achievement I attained from overcoming great beasts here has also kept me going in the real world.

As the name implies, MHW emphasizes the world it has created, giving players several maps to explore. Besides being pretty, these locations provide diverse areas to fight monsters in. As you chase monsters from one area to the next, you’ll find no shortage of ledges, slopes, vine traps, loose boulders or even cannons to gain the upper hand in a battle. This is something that’s very much less present in older MH titles, something I realised after playing MHGU a month ago. 
While the same few maps can get old after hundreds of hours, I think that it was very thoughtful to have such features in the first place that spice up the fight more often than not. Moreso, I enjoyed the exploration itself, running around freely in expeditions to collect mushrooms, look for shortcuts or befriend the local cats--who can actually help out a lot in hunts. Befriending the Grimalkyne tribes in each map means they may set up vine traps to ensnare a monster, or even drop a whole firing squad to give you a chance to brutalize your quarry. 

I also enjoyed collecting the endemic life, though it is a much smaller part of the game. As an animal lover, I was stunned when I threw my net at a random bird on the beach and got to bring it home as a pet. Almost any creature you see in the wild is either a material or a potential pet to let loose in your room, and I have spent many hours hunting down fluffy birds to keep, or fishing for majestic fish in the frozen bowels of the arctic. This is not compulsory unless you’re going for 100% achievements, but I feel it’s a very nice touch to the game, making the world seem more alive. 

While nobody ever plays Monster Hunter for the story, I feel like MHW had a decent storyline, following abnormal behavior of a great dragon and pioneering exploration into the New World to uncover the secrets of the land. While not terribly emotional, I feel that it was linear enough to be clear, and gave story quests some meaning. I do feel that the NPCs were crafted with a lot of thought, seeing how different fleets were sent to the New World every 10 years, each with different specialties like engineering, resource management, research or hunting. This does shape NPCs’ attitudes and lines, especially if they hail from different fleets. 
Moreso, MHW gives presence to the player, as NPC voice lines change according to the recent quests players have completed, or if the player is about to square up against a tough foe. I remember the day I completed all the optional quests in MHW, and I was presented with a bonus quest to hunt 4 challenging monsters in a row. After my success, every NPC in the hub presented me with a short congratulatory message, and it differed significantly between everyone, from the novice hunters strolling around to the resident botanist, and even the sailors who helped out at port managed to get a word in. I recall walking to the highest point in Astera and speaking to the Admiral, who had quite the speech prepared. I screenshotted the whole conversation, and I still look at it from time to time when I'm feeling sappy. It’s a small detail, but I have heartfelt appreciation for the team that decided to implement it, giving some weight to my actions, and making MHW even more immersive. 
All the NPCs are now clamoring for me to face off against the final boss, so in a way I feel like their hopes and dreams are on my back too.

It’s a long review, but I feel like I couldn’t have discounted my feelings for this game with less words. MHW remains my favorite game of all time, and has even encouraged me to delve further into the series with other titles like MHGU and MHR, and now I eagerly await the release of MHST2. If you have any doubts about buying this game, it’s never too late to start. It’s more fun with friends (though I insisted on doing mostly everything solo) so grab your buddies and don’t hesitate to call on pubs if you need help--some randoms are actually really good!
Happy Hunting!


Edit: I beat the final boss for the first time, and on a solo hunt! I finished the quest with 30s left on the clock, but it was really satisfying to get it done, and go through all the NPC dialogue at the end. There's a cool nod to characters from the previous generations as well, which is a nice touch!

Second edit: The endgame grind can get droll, but it's still a blast to play, and a means to pass the time while we all wait for MHRise's PC release, and Sunbreak! I've managed to solo the final boss 15 times now, and while not perfect these hunts have given me some seriously hair raising thrills. I look forward to the challenges I'll find in other games of the series!

Third edit: In 2024 I'm returning to MHW. Rise and Sunbreak were fun, but not nearly as fleshed out as their predecessor. They were a bit arcadey and fast paced, so it's nice to come back to a more organic-feeling hunt and pick up where I left off.",1622370223,1705719219,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Every monster you kill unlocks a new armour to build. There are lots of cut-scenes and a decent enough story to tie things together. Good Japanese VA. Multiplayer is fun.

There wasn't as much content as I was expecting before it threw me back into the early stages for a kind of NG+. Same areas, same enemies, but slightly stronger. If you use the Defender Armour and Weapons you could probably get through those initial stages in about 15 hours.

It's worth noting that even though there are relatively few areas, going back to them is rewarding. I had never fished or caught a bug until 30 hours in. The meta can be complicated, so having experienced players guide you is a plus.

The multiplayer is kinda odd. You can't join another player on a hunt until they've seen all the cutscenes in a level. My friends are all up to iceborne and don't want to play with me anyway. Luckily online matchmaking is decent and other players often help on quests.

Soundtrack and sound design is so damn good. Awesome Graphics and Animations.
Extra DLCs are only Cosmetic.

Here are my personal negative feedback in this game:

-Clutch Claw (Iceborne Expansion mainly)
Clutch Claw mechanic is BS. Iceborne Expansion introduces this mechanic but it also affected the base game as well. Weakness Exploit nerfed to 50% max affinity which also makes it worse for those who don't owned the Expansion. It's ok to not use Clutch claw though, but it makes the hunt quite longer. it's not a really big deal. The problem is not the Clutch Claw itself really, but the constant need to tenderize, since with the Iceborne update many hitzones from base World got updated to reflect the change so tenderize was not to deal more damage but to be as efficient as before but only on the tenderized zones. Also the constant wallbanging to keep the monster enraged is very annoying.

-Decorations
Decorations (Jewels can be slotted to armors to gain armor skill effect.) are obtained by drop chance from hunts. Some of them are extremely has low chance to drop which is frustrating in my opinion. Though Some low tier deco can be obtain through melding process in village. (I don't like that so much grind especially I have a limited time to play because of IRL stuff. If you're an old world hunter like me. I find this deco system grindy.)

-Playable offline?
Possible offline, but you can't Pause the game unfortunately.

-Playable solo?
You can solo the game, finish the main story and the expansion story. BUT, some monsters are recommended with other hunters. Those monsters are still possible to solo but its extremely difficult. and there's a specific monster in the Iceborne expansion that require you to deal elemental damage and destroy a part or else suffer an unavoidable fatal attack after some time has passed.

These are my personal opinion to the game.
Good game in the series overall.",1705676211,1705676211,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If like me you like a challenge and great rewards then this is the game for you. However the game has a few flaws:

1. Questionable hit boxes. For example the monsters sometimes will hit you when you are standing behind or to the sides.
2. The User Interface is not new player friendly and takes time to figure out. Luckily the game has lots of tutorials.
3. The 2 final bosses are infuriating and terribly designed however the rewards are worth it.
4. The end game region that you unlock has since become pointless other than for grinding Transmog items. As a result 
    it has become a ""ghost town"" for some endgame content.

Don't let these issues sway you from trying this game. These are minor issues when comparing it to the rest of the game. Overall this game is in my eyes a masterpiece.",1705667412,1705667412,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Capcom implementing Enigma DRM in their older titles retroactively.

Thing is, invasive DRM is BAD, anti-modding policy is BAD, even IF no performance drop for those games, THERE IS ZERO BENEFIT FOR CONSUMER, simple as that.

And you thought Capcom remove Denuvo from other titles would be a good start, but not really.

Update: Capcom remove Denuvo in June 2021.
Let's just say game's reputation speak for itself after all those years, it is THE game if you don't mind the slow introduction/tutorial, and much better Monster Hunter genre to start with than MH:Rise.

Following the quest but you lost? don't worry there is a tracking device (It's called scoutfiles).
Various monsters, combat equipment, and upgrade with various element power (fire, water, thunder, paralysis, poison, dragon etc.).
Yes, you can upgrade the equipment and forge an equipment.
And you will have a cat (it's called palico) to accompany your journey. 
The palico is quite usefull, because it can heal you and helping you placing a trap while you fighting a monster.
You will have a little farm, to farm item you need and a trailrider safari mission, this feature is quite important because it helping you to find some material or item you need.
There's a lot features in this game if you finish your main quest.
For now I still doing the side quest to upgrade my gears.

The monsters move nice, and have a great move set, but anything the player does seems to be 1.5x slower than it  needs to be.  Got poisoned and need to take an antidote? gotta chug and wait what feels like 30 sec and hopefully slow walk around the enemies attack.  Potions as well.  Using weapons is your character identity.

As someone who has invested 200 hours into this expansive universe, I can confidently say that the experience is nothing short of extraordinary.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2539562247
First and foremost, Monster Hunter World's core gameplay mechanics are great. The thrill of the hunt is unparalleled, with each encounter requiring strategic planning, precise timing, and mastery of your chosen weapon. The game does an excellent job of making each weapon class feel unique, allowing players to find their preferred playstyle. In 200 hours, I've experimented with various weapons, each providing a distinct and gratifying combat experience.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2540681528
The world design is awe-inspiring. From the dense jungles of the Ancient Forest to the frigid landscapes of the Hoarfrost Reach in Iceborne, each locale is beautifully crafted, creating an immersive environment. The diverse range of monsters inhabiting these regions ensures that no two hunts feel the same, constantly keeping the experience fresh and exciting.

The progression system is well-balanced, rewarding players with new gear and abilities as they tackle more formidable foes. The satisfaction of taking down a colossal monster and crafting its armor and weapons is immensely gratifying. The crafting system itself is robust, promoting experimentation and customization to suit individual playstyles.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2539562345
Iceborne, the substantial expansion to Monster Hunter World, elevates the experience to new heights. The addition of the Master Rank, a host of challenging monsters, and the Hoarfrost Reach region extends the game's longevity significantly. The expansion seamlessly integrates with the base game, providing a cohesive and expansive adventure that builds upon the already solid foundation.

Despite the overwhelmingly positive experience, the learning curve can be steep for newcomers, and the sheer volume of content may initially seem overwhelming. However, the game's community is welcoming, and numerous resources are available to assist players in mastering the mechanics.

I've only scratched the surface of what Monster Hunter World and Iceborne have to offer. The continuous updates, events, and the promise of new monsters ensure that the game remains engaging and ever-evolving. Whether you're a seasoned hunter or a newcomer looking for a challenging and rewarding experience, Monster Hunter World and Iceborne stand as a testament to the excellence of the action RPG genre.

This shows how much I love the series, and I care for it deeply.

I can understand why Capcom doesn't like cheating, as I've seen it first hand how bad it got in 4u with custom quest. BUT...

Modding is not cheating, it's NOT one and the same. Mods like custom quest (if it's balanced atleast), custom monsters, performance mods, and visual mods aren't cheating. As they only improve the player experience to those that use them (and it's a matter of choice if anyone wants to use them)

The only mods that can be considered cheating are those that change the crit values, material drop, jewel drop, and more. (I'd even say the Guardian armor that Base Iceborn give to the player, By Capcom is cheating) As it changes game values in order to speedup progression/better equipment.

Don't get us wrong, the majority of us players doesn't like cheater as well. But that doesn't mean everyone who uses mods should be affected.

For me, as someone with a barely passable laptop (minimum pc requirements). I could only run MHW:IB barely in 30 fps with even screen stutters. So a performance mod is essential, as it makes the game playable and run smoothly in 30fps. (NEVER in my mind that I would use a mod to speedup my progression in any way, as I don't like it just like everyone else)

Those mods doesn't affect other players in multiplayer, as they only affect what the game looks to me. So the graphic card can atleast handle the visual load.

Now if Enigma is going to be added in the game, forget players like me running the game barely. As the game will probably become a slideshow and if i EVER go to the ancient forest with Enigma installed... I'm pretty sure my laptop wouldn't handle it. And those that uses mods for fun new quest and challenges are now left in disappointment.

A lot of typicial for japanese game strange design choices, which may be nice for fans, but are simply iritating in this day and age (e.g UI after hunt requires you to click 5 or times to start loading lobby/hub, while no data on the screen is actually important or useful, 
or fact that you cannot coop until some stupid cutscenes are played).
Monsters are nice, but in DLC are not.
Game is very fun playing with friends or even random people online and super frustraiting (for me personally) when playing alone.

It is a lot of ups and downs, but overall I will recommend it for fun coop gameplay.

I will definitelly NOT try out next MH game when it comes to PC.

if you've played monster hunter from the start, then no explanation needed. if you've never played it, remember that there are at least 14 ways you can play the game, and that the only reason monster hunter was not as popular compared to now was because people did not hear about it, which has nothing to do with how good the game is.",1705487129,1705487129,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The core mechanic is 3rd-person melee combos. Button-mashing works at first but not for long.  There are a large set of weapons, each of which behaves in very different ways and has different combo patterns. Switching to a different weapon can make the game feel significantly different. There are a wide variety of consumable items -- traps, flingable objects, healing, buffing -- which are essential rather than additional.  Consumables, armor, and weapons are all craftable, using parts you find or strip from monsters.

Each monster has different strengths, weaknesses, attacks, and movement patterns.  I'm told some of the battles can take the better part of an hour.  The game is a grind that rewards patience and careful observation.

A lot of this stuff is thrown at you in a short period, so if you haven't played other Monster Hunter games it's a bit overwhelming.  (Note: some have said this is the *easiest* MH game to get into.)  You can ignore most of it for the first couple of monsters.

Games are tied into online servers, but it's easy to play solo.

The bottom line is that this isn't something you just pick up and casually slip into.

The opening experience of trying all the weapons and finding 1 of 14 to really dive into, i settled between two Charge Blade & Switch Axe, so much variety and depth of game play. It was so great to feel myself getting better learning both my weapon and the monsters and how they relate to each other. 500+ Hours I went back in the series to try MHGU and see where the series comes from, the old games still  manage to hold up and have character of their own. The sequel game Rise/Sunbreak was wildly different while i didn't care for it at first that has grown to become one of my favorites in the series. Depending on how satisfying you find hunting the same thing multiple times be it for skill or poor luck on drop you really need. 2000+ Hours in the series now glad to see the resurgence in the community around world and all the more excited to see what comes next in Wilds.

Spending a lot of time chasing/searching a monster rather than fighting it. I play MH for the combat experience mostly and having to run after the monster constantly is extremely annoying.

Despite the amount of hours I have put into this game and Rise, whenever I play sessions of the game I normally didn't enjoy playing it and just get pushing through due to suck cost fallacy. 
The concept of the series sounds amazing, hunt giant monsters, either by yourself or with friends, with weapons you have created from your previous victories. For me the experience of fighting these monsters had diminishing returns quite quickly.
I am well aware that there are some people that really enjoy this game and I understand how people can get great enjoyment out of this game. I didn't enjoy having to spend around 30 minutes hunting a monster to then not get the materials I needed, which means I would have to spend 30 minutes hunting the same monster. I didn't enjoy getting hit by a monster, getting stunned, getting hit again, becoming paralyzed, getting hit again, and then dying. Or maybe I should not have tried to play the entire game as a support hunting horn ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. 

So if you are interested in the game and love grinding, min-maxing, and doing excessive amount of research then this might be the game for you.

I have done more research on the topic of Capcom and their DRM additions. That, I have found in all I could pull up, to be not true.

Capcom did not and has not retroactively added DRM to their old titles, and it was simply a snap assumption from people that seemed very believable, this including myself.

My recommendation of this game will now reflect how I feel about the game instead of Capcom as a publisher.

EDIT: 1/14/2024

I have recently seen reports that Capcom did NOT add DRM to their older titles as a reaction to recent modding situations. It would appear that the DRM had been there for over a year.

That being said, I am no authority on the topic. I will edit my review to positive once I am certain I know what Capcom will do going forward.
----------------------Recommendation

Monster Hunter World is an incredible experience. From start to finish, the gameplay loop is polished to a mirror sheen from over a decade of iterations.

The game is a blast with friends, or alone. It's a huge boss rush with light RPG elements.

Smash monsters, wear their skin, make a sword from their hip-bone. Do it to the next dragon that even looks in your direction.

-Reduces performance by up to 10-15 fps, Stutters and crashes to gamers who bought the games legally.

Fights can be intense and keep your on your toes, starting very forgiving at first but as you play deeper and deeper, the difficulty ramps up and punishes you hard should you dare slip up and make a mistake.

The PC community is very angry and has noticed the implementation of your product. It is being mentioned in a ton of negative steam reviews.

You should be aware that there is likely a huge negative PR storm coming your way and possibly offer Capcom advice on how to implement your product properly as you've angered a lot of people. It wouldn't surprise me if big PC YouTubers like Digital Foundry pick up on the issue and make their many subscribers aware.""

 ""Curious, what action do you need from us? And why do you blame us that someone use our software? Someone use, we do not push to use it.
What is our guilt you think?
And why are you so sure that all that you reported belongs to our software?
Maybe you are so angered because you can't use the cheats anymore?""

So basically blaming people who support your games for wanting software that damages the games natural experience to not damage the natural experience AS WELL AS many others wanting to be able to mod the SINGLE PLAYER games that they bought. If someone bought your game, its a single player experience and they arent impacting any other players experience, then they should absolutely be able to experience the game they want to

Leaving a negative review hurts your games reputation and its a valid reason to leave a negative review on all of my owned capcom titles as the company clearly hates its customers, even going so far as to cripple or take down youtubers channels because they used Speedrun mods (like wtf).

CAPCOM has been discovered using a DRM called enigma in many of their games. This prevents moding, cheat engine and gives performance stutters. This DRM is at absolute least suspected to be a sketchy program from a sketchy company in Russia. When the DRM was scaned in an anti-virus by a investigating user the result came back with 34 warnings of trojans and etc.
The DRM is not supposed to be in this game right now, but who knows when it could be.

I have only summerised what information I could find and please take this with a sligth grain of salt.

I'm new to the franchise and this game really is a great place to get started. The game is extremely detailed and after 300+ hours I'm still learning more about the monsters tells and how to prepare for some of the trips into the new world. The game is great if you are looking for game that forces you to learn how to play it with little hand holding, asymmetric fights (not just boss fights), an enjoyable/repeatable gameplay loop and a truly great community of players. With the Iceborne expansion right around the corner, with new monsters, new weapon abilities, new areas and a new story I can't recommend this game enough.

Update 800 hours later......

I recently began noticing consistent frame drops in various areas of the game, primarily the hoarfrost reach and rotten vale... I have not had any issues like this until the last week and I also noticed that the weapon on my characters back twitches uncontrollably from time to time. I started looking into what could be causing this and saw that capcom has added (or maybe plans to add? Dunno, there arent alot of specifics) a particularly intrusive DRM software to the game. Reports seem to indicate that this software (or malware depending on who you ask) can and will cut frame rates significantly. I struggle to understand why capcom would do something like this to a game that came out the better part of 6 years ago... I had been really excited to get back into the game again after the announcement of wilds, but this unwelcome addition to the game as well as the absolutely awful switch port that was Rise, I don't know that I can support capcom anymore...

[strike] And, sadly, I am here, revising my review for the third and final time. I attempted to give Capcom a fair opportunity to address the many glaring problems with Iceborne, but this Safi'jiiva update is the final straw. Capcom is still sneaking around with its buffoonish attempts to terrorize modders and punish game pirates - and all they have accomplished is breaking a game which SHOULD be able to launch and load at this point. I wish Iceborne had never happened. I would give my right eye and Silver Rathalos GS up to just go back to the good, old days of fighting ATKT and Lunastra. Avoid this cancerous DLC and its idiotic developers who can't drop a single update without breaking things. I am done trying to see the good here, this game is a joke and a disaster! Crapcom, really... WTF?

Edit:
I am finally changing my review of this game to a cautious thumbs-up because Crapcom appears to have at last stopped touching it and breaking everything with constant updates. Absurd CPU usage was never fixed by Crapcom. Issues with constant dc in multiplayer hunts were never fixed. Hilariously bad weapon balancing (looking at you, sticky noobs) was never dealt with. But the game is - tolerable in that it can finally be run with half decent fps (through the use of mods that correct Capcom's faulty coding). Buy it on sale if anything, and get with the Iceborne expansion. Base game isn't worth much by itself. What a sad and depressing end to what could have been a GOAT, but instead ended up being a ruby in a dung pile. It shines brightly and gives incredibly awesome moments - when it isn't bogged down by its horrible performance issues, terrible pacing, and constant dc's in the middle of hunts.

Only things I didn't like were RNG decorations (so it could take HUNDREDS OF HOURS to have a good supply of necessary gems) and the monsters were kind of samey until you got to the elder dragons. 
Iceborne, however, is terrible, and so are its changes to the base game in turn. Clutch claw is an awful tool that completely breaks the flow of normal gameplay, and you are forced to use it due to the increased hardness all monsters have so unless you ""soften"" them with the clutch claw your weapons are going to bounce all the time or do fuck all damage, refusing to do this can add up to twice the amount of time to a hunt depending on the monster and their hitzones. On top of this the devs added a specific stagger that has a change to roll for all stagger where the monster moves away and stands there like a dumbass waiting for you to use the clutch claw because they couldn't design monsters to organically provide openings for their garbage mechanic, and LR+HR monsters got this crappy stagger too which retroactively fucks with those early hunts. They also didn't bring up lance at all going into Iceborne making it quite a garbage weapon compared to all the other options on offer, which was a particularly frustrating experience for me as a lance player. The new monster variety is nice and FINALLY adding layered armor for most sets is nice (though it's behind the guiding lands lol so have fun going through the story looking like a dunce). The new monster variety is very welcome, but not at the cost of all this crap. They also added the Guardian set to the game, a set of end-of-High-rank tier armor and super strong weaponry that lets you completely clown on the main story and the high rank content in order to rush to MR stuff, but lets you skip that learning curve in turn resulting in a bunch of baddies in MR who got carried by the MH equivalent of the Drake Sword and cheat armor, have fun with your multiplayer hunts getting dragged down by those people. 
Basically, I don't like MHW because of the changes Iceborne brought. It's still an okay game, but it's not the game I originally loved and paid for, and thus don't recommend it. If you're going to play it anyway, my advice is break out Cheat Engine and just spawn yourself a few of every decoration in the game so you don't have to put up with the shitty RNG gem grind, maybe do it after you get through HR so you can at least understand why I hate that system. I'll take Rise's RNG charms any day over RNG decos. 

On top of this, Capcom are being a bunch of idiots and trying to stop modding because they want to sell you their crappy cosmetic DLC and stuff like char. changing passes THAT SHOULD BE IN-GAME FEATURES BY DEFAULT. And they're doing it by adding a crappy Russian DRM made by a malware company to all their older titles, though only a few are affected right now it's only a matter of time until such reaches this game and future releases. Dragon's Dogma 2 is the final product I'll ever buy from capcom after this stunt.

My only criticism?  The  new player experience is pretty tough.  This game just drops you in the middle of a thicket of complicated systems and barely exerts any effort into teaching them to you.  I mean I've played hundreds of hours of MH Rise and now about 40 hours of World and there are still things I don't really understand.  Of course that's part of the fun of hte game; I just wish it did a better job of making it accessible to people.

Capcom is trying to address this issue by giving new player ""Defender"" gear.  This is a double edged sword because on the one hand while it does make the game a lot easier, it also removes any incentive to engage with a lot of the game's systems.  What's the point of crafting anything new when your starter gear is more than good enough to finish the story?  New players are getting a truncated experience.  Instead of the hunt-gather-craft loop they can just hunt and hunt and hunt without having to engage with any of those systems at all.  You never lose a hunt because your gear sucks, study the monster, study it's elemental resistances, it's weak spots, strategize, figure a new build out, systematically gather the materials, craft what you need and come back and kick that monster's butt.  This is such a core partof the Monster Hunter experience and it's not here now because of the defender gear.

MHW boasts a fantastic lineup of monsters, each with unique behaviors and attack patterns. Taking down these creatures requires strategy and skill, making every hunt intense and satisfying.

A standout feature of MHW is its seamless online multiplayer. Hunting with friends is a blast, adding a sense of camaraderie as you take on formidable monsters together. The game's multiplayer functionality is well-executed and enhances the overall experience.

Customization is a key aspect, with a robust crafting system allowing players to create various weapons and armor. Experimenting with different loadouts adds depth and strategy to the gameplay.

The progression system strikes a good balance, offering challenges without feeling overly grindy. Completing quests earns materials for crafting better gear, leading to a satisfying sense of accomplishment.

While MHW is a triumph, it does have a learning curve, especially for newcomers. The story, though serviceable, takes a backseat to the thrill of the hunts.

In summary, Monster Hunter World is a must-play title for its stunning visuals, diverse monsters, seamless multiplayer, and deep customization options.

for MHW to avoid updating to DRM version. Go to your game location whether it was local disk D or C :\Steam\steamapps.

Right-click on appmanifest_582010 click on properties and set it to read-only, hit apply, hit OK and this will deny Steam from updating the manifest to download the new update.

as for now MHW or possibly MHRISE haven't receive any update on ENIGMA DRM. make sure to do the same method for RISE too to stop updating the game.

as for now some old capcom games got hit with DRM and people already review bombing it to hell. but it's not over yet MHW or Rise might receive the DRM Update sooner or later!

Monsters aren't really a threat, when they attack you, they only really do it once before stopping. The amount of times where I would've had died if the monster continued the attack but decided to stop is staggering. Hitboxes are also pretty bad, but thats a given considering its monster hunter. 

I don't understand some parts, why would a monster cause me to stumble and not attack me afterwards when I am defenceless. Or why would the monster grab me and throw me on the ground so I am stuck prone, and just watch me without capitalising on the opportunity to kill me. People talk about how this game simulates an ecosystem and all that jazz. But this game really struggles with making the monsters actually seem like they have a brain.

I've had moments where the monster gets me in a certain kill combo, but right before the killing move, it decides to just run away. Really immersion killing. They fixed this in Rise, where monsters are actually a threat, probably cause they made the player more OP, so they had to balance it with the monsters, but that's another game.

Another issue I have with World is that the hiding in bush mechanic doesn't really work all that well, if you want to hide from a large monster you have to sit there for a few minutes, in comparison, you can lose threat if you were to just run away for 30 seconds. There is no real incentive to hide in comparison to just running away.

Another issue is with the resources, you practically have infinite resources with access to the camp chest. If you are properly prepared, then you will never run out of potions, this is something I wish they would fix in the new upcoming game Monster Hunter Wilds. I've heard the older generation games are a lot more stringent on the resources you get.

Hope Wilds is able to make the monsters more threatening, rather than the World state, where you can really only die to a one hit kill attack.

Love everything else, though I've heard that Capcom is implementing a DRM on all their games, which will just make everything shittier. Can't really do anything about that though.

The game feels rewarding early game especially getting all the materials from monster but on lategame its just turn off harder monster rare drop make you grind even more and time consuming and i thought harder monster are more rewarding, instead of making harder monster super grindy why not up a little the drop rate make easier monster drop rate a bit rare since its easy to take care off to balance the rewards. Plus harder monster more time consuming and repeat doing same thing over and over again same goes with rare endemic bounties. I hope the future entries are not grindy as this one if they make harder monster. So far that is the only problem i face overall i enjoy the game if you missed out some event you still can access them so you dont feel missed out grab it while you can.
Update: After finishing iceborn it is what it is content were fun same thing same grind then capcom drm make the game stutter a lot so idk what to say i love capcom game but doing this after i spend my money on their product i dont think i will be putting anymore money for it in future release even RE i had almost all of RE games one of my favorite it's a sad future for gaming.",1703746427,1705136897,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

No, not anymore it isn't. Stay away from this company and their games for now. Capcom is going to add Enigma DRM to suppress modding and cheating. But the main problem is the DRM they will add is known to be dangerous, which is why i wouldn't recommend getting anything from Capcom yet or anymore.

There's nothing wrong with modding. Skyrim, Fallout 4, and other games I've known can be an example. But that incident on SF6 should be that player's problem and not modders.

Great game. This is my first time playing MHW, so as a newbie here my thought of the game:

What I thing is positive:
1. Graphic is beautiful.
2. Scene feels alive.
3. Music is easy to hear
4. Monster have their own unique behaviour.
5. Game's difficulty curve is easy to follow. 
6. Main story missions can be beaten alone, but some monster outside of story can give you a real challenge.
7. Crafting is fun
8. Grinding is fun
9. Interesting addition event and collaboration.
10. More feature as story progress ed.

What negative for me:
1. Collider in this game is very weird. Sometimes it's exist sometime it's not
2. P2P connection and no dedicated server
3. Sometimes you missed something that not explained by tutorials. 
4. Tutorial sometimes showed long before player need to know what to do and easily forgoten.",1557329504,1705096152,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am really loving how much it reminds me of dark souls combat-wise.

FORGOT ADD multiplayer is AMAZING. Literally every time I've shot up a flair to get help, someone joins. Sometimes 3 people join to help me. There is still a thriving community on the base MHW. Multiplayer has become on of my favorite aspects of this game so far.

Games I enjoy for reference: Dark souls, dark souls 3, bloodborne, destiny 2, MGSV, shadow of the collosus, ghost of tsushima, kingdom hearts.

Happy to see that people are getting back into World. It is an amazing game with so much content to get into. Each weapon feels intuitive and truly like a tool that requires the time and dedication needed to master it.

What I love about Monster Hunter is that it is truly a game that is about taking on danger head-on. And while World definitely feels like you're on training wheels in the beginning (which can be frustrating at times) once it takes them off, it truly is a game that relies on the skill of the player. It's you that has become a better player. Maybe at first, you got tossed around and couldn't complete a quest without carting once or twice, but eventually, you'll find yourself able to react better and finish quests faster. It teaches you that it's okay to fail because you can always dust yourself off and try again. The time that you put into the game is rewarded, and that's what I love.

There are definitely gripes I have with the game. [spoiler]Tempered monsters were a great addition to give hunters a challenge and incentivize players to do it due to the awards tied to it. However, I feel that it wasn't as balanced as many can attest to on YouTube. Arch-Tempered Monsters being the largest offenders.[/spoiler]

What can also be frustrating is when players are faced with quests with huge spikes in difficulty, causing players to hit a wall as they desperately try to figure out how to fight the damn thing. This is generally common throughout most Monster Hunter games, having an almost unanimously hated monster. While it can be ignored at times, some weapons require that players fight these frustrating monsters to complete certain builds. It can be dreadful to feel helpless as you face them down only to get carted and fail the quest. Of course, with time, you can create a strategy on how to fight them; however, it never becomes a fun experience.

Another point where I think it falls short is in terms of decorations. These are items that are meant to boost certain stats to help complete a build, but when trying to get the specific jewel you wanted (Attack and Critical Chance jewels) becomes a gamble you have to pray for, it can get old very quickly. You could spend tens of hours doing the best quest for that chance and still never get the gem you want (I do want to say that maybe that has changed somewhat as event quests can help in getting rare material. However, I'm starting on a new save and haven't had the need to farm for jewels yet).

Other than that, there are very minor things that I can complain about, but I don't feel that they are important overall. This just might be a love letter to the game series, but I do feel that Monster Hunter World, including the Iceborne DLC, is a unique and immersive experience that will stick with you for the rest of your life. There will never be a game truly like Monster Hunter no matter how hard others may try.

Ladies and gentlemen, gather 'round as I regale you with a tale of a game that's so monstrously fantastic, it's bound to make your heart race faster than an Anjanath (T-rex looking chicken..it has wings) in hot pursuit of a herbivore buffet! I'm talking about none other than ""Monster Hunter World,"" the game that proves that hunting gigantic creatures can be as fun as it is ferocious.

Picture this: You, a fearless hunter armed with weapons that could make even Rambo jealous, embark on a quest to slay the most colossal, fearsome, and downright hangry monsters in the land. But fear not, for ""Monster Hunter World"" isn't just about swinging swords and launching projectiles at overgrown lizards – it's about creating memories that'll have you chuckling long after you've vanquished your prey.

The game's humor isn't just about puns (though there are plenty of those, like ""Why did the Rathalos bring a ladder to the hunt? Because it wanted to go to new heights!""). It's about the joy of teaming up with friends to chase down beasts that make King Kong look like a toddler throwing a tantrum. Ever seen a group of hunters chase a giggling, fire-breathing Tobi-Kadachi through the jungle like a bunch of Benny Hill characters? It's like a comedy of errors, except with more teeth and scales.

And let's not forget the feline sidekicks, the Palicoes. These little furballs will have you in stitches with their antics. Imagine them donning costumes that are straight out of a cat fashion show, wielding weapons, and assisting you in the most hilarious ways possible. They're the real stars of the show, and they're purr-fectly adorable.

But it's not all laughs and guffaws. ""Monster Hunter World"" offers a deep and rewarding gameplay experience. The satisfaction of bringing down a massive beast after an epic battle is unparalleled. It's like taking a rollercoaster ride through a fireworks display while riding a unicycle – you'll feel like a legend.

So, in conclusion, ""Monster Hunter World"" isn't just a game; it's a comedy club, an action movie, and an adventure of epic proportions all rolled into one. If you're looking for a game that combines laughter and exhilaration like a mad scientist concocting a potion, then grab your hunting gear and dive into this monster-sized masterpiece.

IMPORTANT: Master Edition on sale is the cheapest option.

2024:
Crapcom started added a virus into all their games that kills FPS and prevents visual mods, b/c they're ""cheating"".

Oct 2023:
Useless update broke official 4k textures. Fixed after a week.
Many report new crashes, freezes, stutters.

Oct 2021:
They removed Denuvo.
Still crashes sometimes, dunno why.
Dunno if other issues fixed or not.

Apr 2020:
Loading much slower, even on SSD.
MORE ANTI-MOD. Some can't use Reshade anymore.
Random Err12 crash.
DX12 randomly locks PC since 4 patches ago, requiring reboot.
Took 2 weeks to fix MHW triggering anti-virus.
Still very laggy, even on powerful PCs.
Still unstable online that makes raid events impossible to clear.

Jan 2020:
Iceborne breaks everything. Crashes, freezes, save corruption, anti-mod, very laggy anti-cheat.

Oct 2019:
In May, I upgraded from GTX 970 to 1660ti and got ~50+ FPS on the title screen, but I still got the same old ~45-50 FPS in-game, regardless of graphical settings.

Non-Denuvo DMC5 proved that Denuvo limits video card by bottlenecking CPU. Up to 20% performance hit. I later upgraded to a new CPU, same video card. Now MHW runs smooth as silk.

PC Iceborne came out way too late. On PS4 they've finally started dripfeeding 2 year old fashion armors, despite being fully implemented from the beginning. They know it's always been the most requested feature.

Quick summary:
Not a terrible port, but has extremely terrible CPU optimization. You need a powerful video card to use the high-res texture pack, otherwise many textures are very low-res. But it's still superior to console because of higher fps, much faster loading, and mods.

I can't recommend a game with major issues that shouldn't exist. I'd be annoyed if people recommended me a game and it didn't work properly. So I'm not going to do that. I paid for this game, I want them to fix it. Years later, still many unfixed issues.

Major issues (STILL relevant as of December 2019):
- Stuttering on any kind of input. Capcom has only very recently acknowledged this and are finally looking into it. AFAIK not fixed.
- Special K author Kaldaien says the game has worst ever CPU & Denuvo usage. Iceborne also has Denuvo. Early reviews suggest it still runs like crap because of this.
- Blocky skin in cutscenes. This problem exists on PS4 Iceborne, too. STILL.
- Still lacks disable bloom option.

Fixed issues:
- Keyboard settings error and ""can't save game"" error occurs if you store your backup files in the same folder as the other save games. If you move them out, both problems stop.
- You can now see friend sessions even if private, and join friend sessions easily.
- There is now an official high resolution texture pack. Almost a year late.
- Newer Nvidia drivers fixed the huge MHW frame drops.
- Effect huge frame-drops fixed.
- Online disconnection issues seemingly fixed.
- Mouse and keyboard supported.
- After months, they finally added disable DOF and Motion Blur. DOF is still forced on during cutscenes.

Unconfirmed past issues:
- Not sure if clientside can still cause all session players to disconnect via mods.
- Months ago there were reports of crashes on startup caused by Steam Overlay, GeForce Exp, Ansel, Reshade. No idea if fixed.
- Some reports of getting randomly locked out for a day after an update, due to Denuvo.
- There were reports of the Taroth event having crash/freeze issues. Probably fixed.
- Very, very rare bugs (sheath bug, infinite machinegun sound, cannot interact with anything and have to restart).
- All versions of this game reportedly have a small chance of corrupting savedata or refusing to save. So you should try to backup regularly.

PC port positives:
- Loads MUCH faster than the PS4 version, even without an SSD. PS4 takes a minute or two. This loads in a few seconds, presumably if you have enough RAM.
- Looks nice, when it runs properly.
- Minor improvements to the GUI over the PS4 version, which were added to PS4 Iceborne.
- Modding. Now you too can easily wear the tons of NPC-only outfits Capcom keeps making. On top of fixing tons and tons of other issues.
- Several graphic options have a ""variable"" setting that auto-adjusts graphic options in realtime. Some are noticeable, some not so.
- Gamepad support and key config via Steam Big Picture. I've heard there are limitations.
- Option to configure confirmation and cancel buttons (fixes the Asia vs West button swap problem).

Conclusion:
It's pretty obvious Capcom didn't test the PC version enough. Yet they saw fit to give early access to streamers and reviewers, who (as far as i'm aware) did not seem to notice any of these significant issues. Next time, get real testers to test your game.

It took them a long time to admit to and fix many of the problems. CPU optimization (ie. Denuvo) is still so bad that it can seriously impact the frame rate. 

Outside of the ongoing major issues, I think you'd still need to have a clear understanding of what the Monster Hunter games are like. I get the impression many people jump into this game expecting it to be something totally different, and end up disappointed.

As a game, it feels like just barely enough content. By endgame you'll realize it's stretched thin, with heavy reliance on RNG in endgame. It's designed in such a way that you end up fighting the same few monsters over and over until you get burned out.

There are some things that are done well, and several things where it feels like they dropped the ball, or are seriously trying to troll customers by doing the opposite of what everybody wants (no joke...for example, despite players complaining about this for almost a year, they keep adding exclusive outfits and hairstyles for NPCs, despite NPCS and players sharing the same models).

That being said, if you do enjoy the core combat, then you may end up playing this for a long time. I won't go into detail about the gameplay in this review, but I will say that if you just want something to spend 30+ hours on (rough minimum time to complete story) and you don't mind RELATIVELY ""clunky"" (ie. compared to what people normally expect) high-risk controls where you cannot rely on lock-on, then you may want to give this game a try.

If you want to try it first, and maybe refund it, then be careful not to spend too much time on character creation. Just use a preset, get past the unskippable lengthy intro, and jump into training room to try out the weapons. This is a game that relies very heavily on whether you like how the weapons and combat feels. If you don't, you won't enjoy this game.

Also note that this game is easier in solo. Multiplayer has a high chance of people screwing up, resulting in quest failure. Monsters can chain multiple attacks to kill you off a single hit. This happens often when you're learning the game. You're supposed to try not to get hit. Three deaths means restarting the quest. If that sounds frustrating to you, you may want to avoid this game.

Part of the fun is overcoming these challenges. Once you learn the monster patterns and how to use the weapons effectively, it can be a satisfying experience.

UPDATE: Iceborne actually fixes many of these issues. Monsters are less cheap and give you more breathing space in Iceborne. So again, you should probably wait for Iceborne before buying the PC version.

By the way, I'm not a veteran of the franchise. This is the first Monster Hunter game that I've fully invested into. From what I've seen others say, compared to previous games, this one is a few steps forward (eg. much better audio/visual, easier to obtain crafting materials, weapon improvements), and a few steps back (eg. less monster variation, story/setting too ""casual"", annoying NPCs, poor fashion support, lack of things to do in endgame, reliance on limited-time events). Also, you can't do events offline, unless you mod the game.",1534083271,1705068789,False,1030,99,0.747345149517059326,0,True,False,False

The game is great in so many ways, but playing it again I see a lot of re-skinned monsters, the tedious nature of fighting the same monster with different number values makes for a rather boring game at times, especially the end-game.

I used to think it had such a good endgame with a grind that was satisfying and after playing again, this is not the case.  The base MHW game is seriously lacking for content after 40-60 hours, arch tempered monsters are pretty poorly designed and gated behind gear.  The average person isn't going to clear these monsters with their weapon in build in most cases, and it doesn't matter since the fights are the same unreasonable Health/damage values and zero changes to fight animations.  I think the major problem is the health values just make it so tedious, with the exception of xeno'jiva being one that I still remember as fun and different.   I see why I stopped playing before Iceborn ever was released.  Great game, has some re-skin flaws, but not too bad, except when you get to some tempered/arch-tempered versions the game is terrible.

It quickly becomes tedious and infuriating, even if you clear an encounter. They stop being fun and start being like trying to wrestle an oiled up crack head in a bouncy castle.

The iceborne dlc should've seen everyone who worked on it blacklisted from the industry for how it made everything bad much much much worse, and improved nothing.

I'd like to recommend it, but there's a huge pile of very bad design decisions that exist at such a fundamental level you'd have to remake the entire game to fix them. Most of them aren't really obviously terrible decisions until you reach the very poorly designed encounters that litter the late base game and entire iceborne dlc.

Some examples:
-Dodges have essentially no iframes, it's like 5 frames. Most attacks are triple that in duration and have after effects that linger.
-Your character moves clunkily and with no sense of urgency ever, every consumable is used at a glacial pace. 
-More animations than not are locked-in, you cant interrupt or get out of them.
-Most monsters in the late-late base game and entire expansion are fast, spammy encounters with huge health bars.
-Clutch claw and tenderizing, everything about it, especially in iceborne. The design of most encounters makes the openings you need to do it very rare, but you need to do it for the encounters to not take six centuries. It's just bad all around and designed around multiplayer and monsters acting in ways that they didn't design them to act in.
-Decorations are all around just a bad way to do what they were trying to do with them. There are so many mandatory things you need for any given build, some of which basically aren't accessible until the game has gotten to such a point you're nearly done with it.
-Cool/Hot drinks. A mechanic that is mandatory to make an area not suck the life out of you, that adds nothing to the game and exists only as a tax to be in that area. Nothing in the game would change if this wasn't done, other than less wasted time and less annoyance.
-A huge amount of the game wasn't designed to be played solo but you're not going to find players to do either. Event quests, sieges, etc.
-Hitboxes. The monster hitboxes are janky at best, and often you will be hit by things that shouldn't have hit you, combined with the non-existant dodge its at times extremely bad unless you're using certain weapons with guards so you don't have to dodge.
-Food system. Everything about it could be done in any other way and it would be better than it is.
-The mantles and specialized tools kind of feel like they exist to work your way around the bad encounter design, rather than giving you interesting ways to interact with them. They make you immune to effects or what not, which is just a really round about way to give you windows to avoid the bad design rather than anything else.

I could continue, but it's just a pile of janky design that was fun in the base game when the monsters kind of roughly followed the same rules you had to, but as the game goes on, you have these rules and arbitrary limits and the monsters don't anymore.

Some people enjoy it and would disagree, but the issue is enjoying bad design doesn't make that bad design good, it just means you like shit.

They're also adopting an anti-modding stance, and possible DRM additions to prevent that modding. So they're going to make it impossible to mod the game to make it playable. This is the killing blow to an already difficult to reccomend game.",1704690024,1705046641,False,0,0,0.456140369176864624,0,True,False,False

I think that there is a lot that can put someone off of a MH game and that's mostly due to the lack of tutorials or ""progression"" in a sense.

The progression in this game is getting better gear to fight stronger monsters, and while that is ""the game"", it's more-so about build management and mastering your weapon of choice. You can play a weapon for 200 hours and all of the sudden realize a cleaner way to hit something mid fight and that is what feels amazing. Once you READ and learn all of the skills and addons for your armor and weapons, it becomes about becoming a COUNTER to your enemy instead of a jack-of-all-trades fighter. 

The story is predictable but enjoyable, and the only real downside to multiple playthroughs is the lack of cutscene skipping. 
The community is funny, and helpful but the wiki will be your best friend. It should practically come installed into this game.

However, I hope they fix the connection issues. I think the only reason its this bad is because of the poor connection through steam when Valve updated their chat client. I hope it gets fixed soon.

As a seasoned player with hundreds of hours invested in the base game, Iceborne feels like a magnum opus, seamlessly integrating new content while refining the core experience.

The frozen frontier, Hoarfrost Reach, is a visual masterpiece, showcasing the franchise's evolution in graphical fidelity. The seamless transition from the lush Ancient Forest to the frigid expanses of Hoarfrost Reach is a testament to the game's technical prowess. Each locale is a frozen tableau, breathing life into the monsters that inhabit them. The dynamic weather systems further immerse players in the harsh realities of the icy ecosystem, introducing an element of unpredictability to every hunt.

The expansion's real triumph lies in its creature design. The new subspecies and elder dragons are the epitome of ferocity, pushing even the most seasoned hunters to the brink. Velkhana, the flagship monster, is a crystalline marvel, demonstrating a perfect blend of elegance and lethality. The meticulous attention to detail in their animations and behaviors adds depth to the already diverse bestiary, making each encounter a visceral spectacle.

The Clutch Claw, a new addition to the hunter's arsenal, introduces a layer of strategy and risk-reward mechanics. While it may seem daunting at first, mastering the Clutch Claw elevates the combat experience to new heights, allowing for creative combos and openings to exploit a monster's weaknesses. This nuanced approach to combat underscores the game's commitment to rewarding skill and adaptability.

The Master Rank difficulty curve is a relentless ascent, ensuring that even the most seasoned hunters will find themselves humbled by the challenges that await. This spike in difficulty is not only a testament to the expansion's commitment to providing a true endgame experience but also a nod to the franchise's legacy of pushing players to constantly evolve their hunting tactics.

However, the introduction of the Guiding Lands, while conceptually intriguing, does pose some pacing issues. The constant grind for materials to level up regions can feel like a tedious chore, potentially deterring those who seek a more straightforward progression. Balancing this aspect of the endgame experience could have made the grind more enjoyable without sacrificing its intended purpose.

In conclusion, Monster Hunter World: Iceborne is an opulent celebration of the franchise's rich history, pushing the boundaries of what a Monster Hunter experience can be. The meticulously crafted environments, challenging monsters, and refined mechanics make it a must-have for fans and a compelling invitation for newcomers to join the hunt. While the endgame grind may test one's patience, the sheer satisfaction of conquering the frozen titans of Hoarfrost Reach makes every struggle worthwhile. Embrace the cold, sharpen your blades, and embark on a glacial odyssey that will leave you breathless in both awe and accomplishment.Monster Hunter World: Iceborne stands as a majestic expansion to the already triumphant Monster Hunter World, offering an arctic expanse teeming with formidable beasts, captivating landscapes, and an avalanche of new challenges for veteran hunters.

I highly recommended you to also buy the Iceborne DLC because it will give you even more hunting experience with more monster, equipment, moveset, and more.

One thing I like about this game is the ecology system they put in the world, not only just a large monster, but small monster or even endemic life they put in this game is pretty beautiful, sometimes I'm not even hunting any monster and just enjoy the world, walking around, fishing, or listening to the hub/room music.

I wish they had released all the cosmetic items in the game instead of charging £444 for them it's like begging for extra moneys.

Just a little gripe about responsiveness, but its the same with all the previous versions of Monster Hunter. the character walks a few steps in any direction whenever you tap the button, you get used to it but it is a bit like a cheesy console port, they would argue it gives the world charm.

didnt like the clutch claw too much with the weapons i mainly used (charge blade, weeb sword, swagaxe, bow), but just a mechanic issue on my part if anything lol, felt like it didn't flow well into certain combos
beat velkhana on base iceborne, took a break and a friend recommended a mod called the 'Iceborne Community Edition' mod that had me swooping back into the game with it's really nice qol changes (im honestly spoiled by what they've changed and i love it)
base game will always be good though, the depth in the weapon's movesets are sometimes pretty deep (looking at charge blade here) though mastering a monster's movesets and knowing one's weapon feels incredible its like a drug if anything
guaranteed a good time if youre willing to learn how to dance around a monster's attacks while learning your own attacks to punish and hunt said monster

in comparison to their sequel, this game have good and bad change to it. 
Since I'm a combat based player, how smooth the combat is are very important to me. and this game's combat in comparison to Rise is really clunky and having a lot questionable shit. 
Start off with the hit box, the hit box of this game is absolutely dogshit, explosions have hitbox way larger than it visual displayed,  dragon's rush have questionable hitbox especially on it's ass and leg position. and there's other weird hitbox. 
Second is the item usage and other weapon arts registration issue. first is item usage, the item consumed is register at the moment you use it, which cause two issue. 1, if the monster attack you in the same moment, the effect will not go off but the item will be used. which is just dumb, looking at other game like dark souls, the item will either not be used or the effect will be go off. 2, the animation of use an item can be cancel, but  result the same issue, effect not go off and item been consumed. this also apply to some weapon art tho that's rarely the case. second issue are the utility, it feels the devs intentionally make some basic mechanics worst so player need to choose between give your damage to compensation for the lack of mechanics, or endure this clunky mechanics and have good damage. 
Third is character's reaction.
Character react to all sort things, roar, tremor, wind, mud etc. it is good to see this amount of detail, but it is too much to a degree that effect the combat smoothness, sometime the character get knock down and just lay on the ground for like 20 sec with hand up for no reason, like what you gonna take a nap in mid of all the chaos? no need for it alright, it's too much, react to roar, tremor and mud seems make sense, but like every movement the monster does the character gonna react to it is really excessive. 
putting all those together, most classes of melee weapon would feel a clunky, slow and lumpy gameplay. 
The combat is the main issue this game have, let's talk about which part this game did well. 
Environment and Monster tracking.
In comparison to Rise, the amount of detail and graphic this game brings are shocking, and you need find tracks to find the monster is also make this game more fitting to it's name. it really feels like in a world hunting for monsters, (if you ignore the crappy combat). Scout flies are great tool point direction and item around the player. 
Story 
Story is top tier story, a great expedition team story, better than the rise one. 
Mechanics
The slingshot mechanics is very different than rise, i'm not sure if i like it, so i put no opinion on that. 
UI 
UI i do pefer rise version, more cleaner and easy to see. world's UI difficult to get start with but get used to over time. 

Overall if you are causal player and really don't care about combat, go ahead it gonna be a great game. but if you are combat orientated player like me, especially coming from dark souls, i would definitely recommend rise over world. the combat just way smoother and better hitbox, get used to rise than come to world would surely make it more comfortable. the big chop off on the score is the combat, other UI etc are small things. I do wish Wilds have combat similar to rise, at least just some improvement on hit box things mentioned above and but other things like world.",1704858060,1704858060,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Just an update on this review. After almost 400 hours and coming back to it a few years later during the back to MHW campaign, memories of this amazing game has returned..And I can without a doubt say in terms of gameplay, this was the best game I have EVER played. Nothing else like it. Can't wait for MH Wilds!!! So excited! I would easily spend hundreds to buy the next successor to World. Heck, I'd happily go homeless to buy it.

Previous Review:
This game is absolutely fantastic and is a blast with friends.
Two things I HIGHLY recommend for all new players.

1. DO NOT USE THE DEFENDER SET. 

This was put in so new players could rush to start Icebourne DLC. But by using this set it will take away from the whole genuine experience (the way the base game was meant to be played). You will miss out on a HUGE part of Monster Hunter's rewarding progression. The crafting, the upgrading, and customizing of equipment and armors. Also, you take away from the challenge of hunting monsters by giving yourself this (Base) endgame set right at the get go.

2. ASAP Try all the different weapon sets (before you even start your first mission).

 Each weapon has a unique playstyle and almost feels like playing a different game. There's many experiences of people who try this game and don't like it, then come back and try a different weapon and absolutely love the game (me included).
(You can do this by accessing the training area. Go to your room, talk to the Housekeeper palico, and access training. You can change between all 14 different weapon sets in the training area.)

-Constant disconnection of parties
-inability to reform party while in mission
-Monsters buff persisting when a multi-party team becomes 1 due to disconnection
-Fraction of rewards granted to survivor of disconnected party due to entering with multiplayer
-multiple dissconnection errors rendering player unmoveable after disconnection via multipl disconnection prompts

     I was really hesitant with playing this game for the first time. Seeing general game play and mostly clips of fighting the monsters left the game undesired for me at first. The Combat looked really janky and slow. Even now I can still see how newcomers won't be thrilled or convinced at watching game play unless, you show them Turf War sequences or special weapon animations. I was first only interested and gave it a chance because of the cross overs like the Wticher, Devil May Cry, and Final Fantasy. I ended up becoming a big monster hunter fan because of it
    But trust me the combat is really engaging and fun. Also Hunts do take on average 25-40 mins which for a lot of people who haven't played the game say it seems like too much. I will admit there are some monsters where they are little too easy and unengaging. You'll just be sitting there waiting for it to be finished while some are really frustrating and not fun. But there are so many fun monsters to fight once you learn the move set it becomes a dance, each different time you fight it you will be better then the last hunt. you will be able to land your risky moves more consistently. There is also the aspect of using the environment to your advantage. You will be keeping track of your positioning, the monsters positioning while you weave in and out looking for optimal windows while at the same time keeping an eye on environmental advantages you do can go for which help you deal big damage. Turning those 35 minute hunts feel like 5-10 minutes
    Now the clutch claw, alot of people complain about it which I do agree. It feels really janky to aim and shoot it. The clutch claw is a core game play feature which you need to learn. I don't really mind it as its another thing you need to juggle as you hunt a monster keeping you engaged.  
     There are different weapons and each weapon has a solid learning curve. Not only do you got to learn the kit of your weapon but learning the monsters move set allows you to plan and space your attacks meticulously. I spent a good chunk of the game playing Long sword which I found interesting and never boring tru my first 300 hours of the game, then i changed weapons trying different ones. Each weapon makes you approach the same monster differently and figuring how to navigate the fight is where most of the fun in the game is. This alone makes me see myself playing it for another couple hundred hours. As i just enjoy fighting the fun monsters with different weapons. 
    As a guy thats into PVP games like fighting games, Mobas and MMOs I'm not really into strictly only PVE games but this game changed my view on PVE. I never would have imagined my self playing a PVE game for long. but some of the monsters are hard and so well designed. Which I really enjoy helping players when they send out help request signals.  
   There is a lot of hate on how Multiplayer is handled. which is warranted. You cannot start a hunt from the story if both players haven't watched the cut scenes which results in players just waiting idle in different lobbies/instances waiting to exit and rejoin their friend. but outside the story mode hunts you can pretty much join any quest if you have it unlocked.  
   The UI for upgrades and crafting your gear also sucks, they seem to add extra steps while also making it a little confusing for no reason which I feel could have easily been on the same page or menu. 
    Overall, its a game where it shines in its game play, gear progression and obviously, the monster designs.",1700270308,1704824819,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The level of detail that was put into this game is astonishing, and every fight feels different every time. While hunting monsters you can have something called a turf war: when two monsters meet they will sometimes fight each other, and there are special fights for [b]EVERY[/b] monster combination. The amount of time that must've been spent on animating the fights alone is astonishing. You can have one monster picking up another and throwing them around with tremendous force, or you could have two flying monsters brawling in the skies. (There are some really cool ones but I wont say because you should see them for yourself) There are some combinations you will probably never see, and there is still a unique fight for it. 

You're given around 20 weapons to choose from, and each one is unique in some way. There are many hidden mechanics involving weapons that are never told to you and it truly makes you feel like you've mastered the weapon when you figure them out.

If you are considering buying this: please get Iceborne. It is like an entire sequel within the game. It more than doubles the content and provides a ton of endgame replayability.

I bought this over Xmas break with some friends and we never got into a game so hard. Two solid months, each day after work, poof --- gone in a flash. Each zone is gorgeous in their own right, each monster fight have been very fun and some monsters continue to deliver fun fights even after understanding the monsters patterns! Even after a few hundred hours on this game, I've still yet to beat some of the end-game monsters, photos, treasure hunting...so much more to do still!!! 

Beware arch-tempered Velkhana...

Side musings: I have tried Rise when it came out --- I have not gotten the expansion. I preferred World since the fighting in World seems to demand a bit more respect in terms if you read a monster's attack wrong or you charge up your attack at the wrong time, you will get punished.

Does it spawn you right next to that player? No. You have to run all the way from the starting camp to wherever the other player is on the map, meaning by the time you get there, there is a good chance the monster is already dead.

This game is a masterpiece. Yes, it has its flaws (like Iceborne making you weaken monster armor parts before they take significant damage, also the endgame grind of Iceborne is pretty soul-crushing), but when taken as a whole, it's a masterpiece and resides firmly in my list of one of the best games of all time.

And that's before you even start messing with mods and making the game even more great. 

Pro tip for any new players: don't listen to anyone about how you want to play. Want to cheese the game with a broken build? Do it! Want to install some mods to make the fights easier? Go for it -- as long as you remember that in any public lobbies you won't have those benefits and can drag a team down if you keep carting due to lack of training wheels.

However, I have never touched a game with a more convoluted and joypadized control scheme in my life. Every button has like 5 different functionalities, there are dozens of commands requiring a double button input, there are about 6 different god forsaken radial menus which also somehow interact with each other, and to top it all off it has the classic Japanese UI that makes absolutely no logical sense whatsoever. I refuse to believe that anyone with an ounce of sanity would ever be able to even come up with this psychopathic scheme. 

Moreover, the game is infested with a ridiculous amount of hand holding. The first time you get sent to do the ""exploration"" mode, there is an NPC that has you on quick dial (yes, they somehow have phones) and he will endlessly spam you with ""OVER HERE! HEY! OVER HERE! OVER HERE! HEY! OVER HERE! OVER HERE!"" regardless of the fact that you are a biom and a half away from him. He will do it while you're gathering, he will do it while you're fighting, he will do it while you're reading the options, he will not stop until you do as he pleases. To make matters indefinitely worse, his spamming was completely irrelevant to the task I was doing. I was supposed to find a spot for a camp, and once I got to him, the game had completely forgotten about the camp quest and just started a monster hunting one. 

Six hours into the game (about 4 of which was figuring out the controls) and it does not feel like I am ever going to be let off the hook to just go and play. 

Oh, and almost forgot, the core concept of the game is hunting big scary monsters in order to get crafting materials and improve your gear. This whole ordeal is completely disregarded by the fact that they outright GIVE you weapons and armors in the beginning of a game that are about 5 tiers stronger than the most upgraded starting gear you are able to craft in the entire first region. I believe they call it a ""catch up"" mechanic to make you skip the early game.  Idiotic.

EDIT: IT GETS WORSE!
Several hours into the game after I had decided to give it a fair chance after all the nightmare I sat through, I have seen a person grapple onto an enemy. After 2 more hours of trying to figure out how it's done, I spend an hour more looking through guides on the internet only to figure out that the mechanic is locked behind a DLC.

Like once you reach the end of World, in order to to being able to do every Optional 9* quests you have to gather tracks of Tempered Monsters.

[b]Update[/b]

Played more, still not that great. Visuals are fine-to-good, still - better than MH:Rise. Plays better than it looks, but not by much. HUD is fine, but menus are 100% console. Menu translations are terrible and unhelpful. UX is abhorrent. VO is a bit obnoxious. Engaging, but monotonous. It is fine if you are looking for a grind. Boss fights are simple and easy to learn - you will have most on farm after 1-2 kills. The catch-up equipment turns the game into a speed-run and removes the grind, which is 80% of the game.

Hub area is extremely poorly designed for player efficiency. Gathering Hub area gets locked out (for no apparent reason) if you start a quest and aren't already in it. Auto-crafting is not quite as automatic as it could be. Gathering should be mindless but is annoying due to how they handle slinger ammo. Pretty much every interaction has higher priority than looting a boss, meaning you have to move loose items away before looting.

Their mission system, the 20/60s mission end timers, and their lobby-based multiplayer are useless and outdated, even for 2018. The mounted combat is boring and dumb: 11111111111. Resources respawn too fast (why do they respawn at all?!). Inventory is too limited for no reason: going back to camp, which is basically free, gives you access to your full stash. Too many Investigations (side quests) get generated too quickly. Additional cultivation plots unlock too late. RNG elemental damage isn't appropriate for a game that is supposed to reward a calculated play-style.

Sharpness mechanic isn't as bad as you initially think it is, but it is still useless and needs to die in a fire. There are 7 different ""you can't do anything"" status effects, which shows just how creatively bankrupt this series has become. So many useless, time-wasting mechanics in these games. They fill your playtime will dull drone work to inflate their numbers. Either that, or they are sadists and their player-base is full of masochists. So many better ways to spend your free time than playing MH.",1610698088,1704677938,False,1,1,0,0,True,False,False

The new monsters are no joke – they're tough, cunning, and a real test of your hunting skills. Each encounter is a unique experience, and the satisfaction of taking down these beasts is just unmatched. The progression system is addictive, and upgrading your gear to face even bigger challenges is incredibly rewarding.

What's impressive is how seamlessly Iceborne integrates into the base game. It doesn't feel like an add-on; it feels like a natural extension of the adventure. The story is engaging, filled with surprises, and keeps you hooked from the get-go. It's a great balance between expanding the lore and staying true to the Monster Hunter vibe.

The Master Rank difficulty brings a new layer of strategy into play. It's not just about hitting hard; it's about planning, adapting, and working together with your team. Multiplayer is as fun as ever, and tackling these challenges with friends adds a whole new level of excitement.

Seliana, the new hub, is a cozy little haven. It's a perfect contrast to the frosty surroundings, and the attention to detail in its design is fantastic. It's a great place to unwind between hunts.

The commitment from the developers is evident in the regular updates and events. It keeps the game feeling fresh, and the community is one of the friendliest I've encountered. There's a real sense of camaraderie and helpfulness, whether you're a seasoned hunter or a newbie.

In a nutshell, Monster Hunter World: Iceborne is a masterpiece. It builds on what made the base game great and introduces new elements that enhance the entire experience. Whether you're a die-hard fan or just dipping your toes into monster hunting, Iceborne is a must-play that guarantees hours of thrilling gameplay and a community that feels like a hunting family.

I've played for rougly 2 hours and never figured out how exactly does the game determine where I want to hit. And if you're only able to hit once every 3 seconds, that's a huge deal.

Dialogues - Technically, there is dubbing. Sometimes. There's just enough to prevent you from getting used to silent NPCs. The game would be better without it.

Visually, monsters look nice and so does the enviroment. BUT HOLY FUCK are weapons and armours ugly. There is no consistency other than everything being big. I guess you just have to sell 200 DLCs somehow. 

Also, corpses despawn VERY quickly. If you fight a group of enemies, you have to loot whatever you kill right away. That's not the biggest problem, but it's definitely the most ridiculous.

I want to play the HBG not clutch claw with arrows that do less damage because I didn't make the monster run into a wall within the last 30 seconds by landing the jankiest projectile in the game, nevermind that in and of itself being a feat with how often it fails to do it's one job of hitting the spot you're aiming for.
Ruins the flow of the gameplay, immersion and player expression in my opinion when the fights turn into tenderizing sessions with a few windows for damage in between the monster being enraged or flailing pathetically on the ground.
That said, the base game is still a lot of fun and enjoyable despite every monster being balanced around an item you may or may not have as it's part of the DLC.

Here is my Professional Opinion on this game: Monster Hunter: World is a MASTERPEICE of course this is my opinion but I believe that this is a great game for professionals and new players alike. of course all good games come with their flaws and this game is one of them the flaws are few but there are some such as getting stunlocked or the game sometimes not registering your dodges but those are really my only rants. The combat is on a whole other level and with a plentiful array of weapons it suits multiple play styles. The monster design and graphics are amazing and the voice acting is great.

Bindings for keyboard + mouse feels like they are made by someone who has never seen a keyboard in their life but it is technically better once you learn it. The game feels way more natural on a controller and you can play it on a controller easily for anything that doesn't require too much aiming.

It's a shame that playing the campaign with a friend requires you to view cutscenes individually before being able to join up, that got much better in Rise.

I've played Tri, Tri Ultimate, MonHun Portable 3rd, 4, 4 Ultimate, Generations, and into World and Rise (I didn't ever get to play Frontier, but damn would I have loved to), and I have to say that this game - World - is their masterpiece.

As it stands right now this is their best game to date and I don't mean this lightly. It's beginner and veteran friendly, supports a wide variety of playstyles due to the 14 different and unique weapons to choose from, and has a good progression system through the main storyline.

Some of the best features they've added to make this a more fast-paced and enjoyable game include (there's probably more I'm forgetting, but I'll add them as I replay through this game):
- No more loading screens in between individual numbered areas on the map.
- An auto crafting system that takes things you pick up and turns them into more useful items (Herbs -> Potions, etc.)
- Faster movement and no stamina usage when outside of a hostile monster's eyesight.
- Active resource grabbing allowing you to keep moving unless you're digging up bones or mining.
- A more proactive room decorating system with multiple rooms to decorate.
- To add to the decorations you can capture common and rare (sometimes extremely rare) fauna and keep them as pets in your room.
- The weapons attacks, combos, and new techniques provide further fluidity when fighting and chasing down monsters.
- The slinger pods that allow you to stun monsters and keep them from leaving areas is one of the best features.
- The sheer brilliance of some of the later Elder Dragon fights, of which I won't disclose for new players. But there's one in particular that is one of the sickest scenes I've ever seen.
- The addition of activatable items such as the Boosters and Mantles make this game extremely adaptive.
- A brand new style of hunt called the Siege - it was meant for 4 teams of 4 players to work together to take down giant monsters (you can now solo/4-man these).
- Being able to change the look of your armor without changing the armor itself is new to this game as well.

I do have a few complaints that are subject only to this game; The cutscenes really needed a skip feature and to allow your friends to still join you at the beginning of a hunt, but I think this is solely for the original story line (I forget if that's the case for Iceborne). Some of the weapons could have been designed better instead of monster parts slapped onto the base weapon, but I understand it could have been due to them learning a whole new system and putting some heavy time into the Quality of Life changes.",1704561855,1704561855,True,2,0,0.548022627830505371,0,True,False,False

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1704559543,1704559543,True,7,2,0.516719937324523926,0,True,False,False

The thing that somewhat soured my experience was the end game content. There is so much missed opportunity here. Capcom could've opted to create a huge amount of interesting and fun end-game armour sets used for different situations and monster fights. Instead, all you get is Fatalis gear which is best-in-slot for almost all situations. The end game progression is extremely linear. Want to play longsword? Kill X, craft Y. Want to play hammer? Kill X, craft Y. Once you've done this there is nothing left to do at all. There are some variations, but really not enough to keep you interested long term unless you're fine with the repetitive nature. Not to mention weapons don't really feel significantly stronger than each other. I literally equipped the second best weapon in the game and I couldn't tell the difference in power over the one I was using before it. Same can be said for armour. It does not feel like it does anything at all.

Another thing that irked me end game is how it forces you into the Guiding Lands. Guiding Lands, for those unacquainted is basically a single map with all biomes in it. The game forces you to grind in this area leveling up different biomes within it to unlock monsters to fight so you can unlock their outfits. (Yes, it's mostly a cosmetic grind.) You can only have a few unlocked at once (which is another issue on its own) however ALL you have to do at the end of the game is unlock outfits, do event quests and grind Guiding Lands. Forever.

The game has some truly magnificent qualities like the soundtrack. The music is probably the best part of Monster Hunter. Most monsters have a unique theme that fits their personality and design, generally to a T. (Look up Rajang's theme, it's great.) The monster design is interesting, though not all of the fights are fun. Some feel like they have been designed to frustrate the player. See the monster 'Vaal Hazaak'. If you are a melee class, good luck fighting it. It halves your health if you go near it then slowly damages you over time. It's quite frustrating. Not to say it's impossible to kill, but it IS annoying.

Overall, MHW (and the Iceborne DLC) are good games, I just feel that the late game content is stale. Almost like they slapped it on at the end after making the rest of the game. As you can see, I got many, many hours out of it, so overall it was a great deal for the price I paid, I just feel that so much potential was wasted in regards to end game content. Add on to all of these issues the numerous small issues the game has, like whenever you need to speak to a vendor you need to listen to them rant about something random before they will open their shop, or the fact that the multiplayer is extremely tedious when it comes to grouping up with people, or even the fact that there are long loading screens even with an SSD, I really cannot recommend this game to anyone without them first understanding what they are getting into. You may not have an issue with the things I've listed, and in that situation this game is probably perfect for you. However if you, like me, feel that these issues could potentially spoil an otherwise good experience, you may want to give it a miss. It's entirely up to you.",1610454016,1704539428,True,1,0,0.507692337036132813,0,True,False,False

Grab it when its discounted with Iceborne if can, friends are mandatory for chill play till iceborne , if this was your first MH game (same as me) i somewhat recommend it to see whats the Highs and lows for MH , now what are the cons..? ehem..

-has some issue with Playing together such as Connection problem, and if it occurs during Hunts with friends your slot for players in that quest decreases by 1 so it would make an annoying thing.

-if you want to progress with your friend , each of you has to see the cut scene first  > abandon > join your friends quest after they saw it

-Some moves and features  are iceborne exclusive...

-i would say if you only buy the base game , you wouldn't have lot of new content aside from HR event quest and Completing all The Optional Quest

-it has Rotating raid/events but thats pretty stupid now since this game doesnt have any updates anymore  , it will only locks you from certain Armor and weapons for at least 2 weeks till the next one..

Iceborne is just a stat check DLC. Even when you have gear appropriate for that hunt you will still be a 2-3 shot against any 360 move that all Iceborne monsters have and spam consistently. Also every IB monster has 3-5x the normal HP from any monster from base game with no additional stat increase to any of the new weapons added into it. So you are actually gated by an artificial health wall while also being a 2 shot when doing any IB monster hunt. Hunts in base game used to take me just 5-10mins on a non meta build now take 20-30 mins in IB. New DLC has made me better but hate the series more. 

Just get the Base game and play until you get to HR 50-100 then decide if you want a bullet sponge challenge before you get Iceborne.",1704487051,1704487051,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Base Game: Much of the 'GOTY' talk is a little ridiculous though. Story is cringeworthy at best and all the morons carting at the first wave of Behemoth (normal) can't convince me that the gameplay is so good that there needed to be no story and only 5 true zones.

Icebourne: Recommended, awesome, and honestly rejuvenates the game in many forms; adding quality of life updates (things that feel like they should have been here all along) and the launcher/claw finally has use other than being where you launch flashpods. It totally bombards you with things to do and tutorials to explore; but ultimately becomes ""how many reskins can be performed before you notice"" and you may be sick to DEATH of the game by the time you reach the endgame. 

The strangest phenomenon is that Capcom's tried and true RPG mechanic ""omg the boss is going to perform a nova/AOE attack so run"" is a standard M.O. late game and for maybe six months of playing this game, not many people have ""wisened up"" to this point; The last 4 patches spanned over the last 8 months or so are all different bosses on this focus/mechanic and it's real shit with pugs. In fact, with the exception of some shooting games, I don't think I've had WORSE pugs than in this game. Some fantastic new friends, but some real stinkers too.

Not recommended because it's really hard to sell this amount of time wasting to the standard player, but if you enjoy the series or Anime Souls, join the party.",1547098773,1704464172,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

i can easily say this is genuinely one of the best Action RPG's ever created.
This game is NOT easy, it'll take a ton work to learn the mechanics of each weapon, and all the individual Monster Fights (But you could just look up a guide).
You have 14 weapons to pick from, from a basic Sword and Shield to a fully automatic Chaingun.
But after you learn the fights, learn your weapons (unless you just use dual swords), start getting your builds and gear set up, nothing is as satisfying as putting down the guy who's been kicking your butt all night, and turning him into a pair of pants.
I'm extremely excited for Wilds, to continue the story as long as the handler is killed within the first 5 seconds.
If you haven't played this, OR Monster Hunter:Rise yet, i highly recommend them both.

Still the peak of the series. Cut a lot of more experimental stuff to focus on the basics to do those very well.
Every single weapon feels impactful to use, fights are challenging and require adapting in both playstyle and armor/upgrades, environments are dense and feel rewarding to explore and learn the layout of. 

My only complaint would be that the way multiplayer story progression is handled is a little weird (having to watch a  cutscene before being joinable or able to join lots of missions means all but one player have to start and abandon the mission to join another player) and sometimes the online connection can be a bit unstable.
But I can still return to this game over and over again and have as much fun as i did when i first played it.

Original Review: Played the Game already on Xbox One and Xbox One X before for about 60 hours.
In short: Great game, finally brings Monster Hunter to the modern times, since while it was stuck on Nintendo consoles it didnt really advance from the state it was on when it was on PSP in the 2000s.
Perfect balance between useful changes, next gen improvements and old charme.
Some monsters have some questionable hitboxes, leading to occasional frustration, but not ebough to harm the experience overall.

PC port seems great. I know some people had issues, but for me it runs like a charm.
Detailed settings for graphics and gameplay, can even rebind secondary keybinds on Keyboard. I have a Controller, but actually prefer Keyboard in this case because the shortcuts you can use on PC are really useful, Mouse fully works even in menus.
Very well worth the wait since the console launch, this is the best way to experience Monster Hunter World now.",1533861995,1704410133,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Look at the global achievement statistics and you'll see that this game's completion rate is very high. The main story is about 45 hours, but if you want to grind and melt faces, try all the weapons, or are new, it should take longer.

My only personal gripe is the story is constantly asking you to continue it, I feel like in MH3U, back when I was terrible at MH, much more of it was spent on grinding quests without the story bothering you, but that was back before Dark Souls was really a thing.

The Good:
There is a crap ton of content.  Way more than you normally see in games these days and Iceborn adds even more.  There's around 40 to 50 huntable monsters in the base game and a lot of smaller farming creatures.  This gives you a lot of variability in hunts and the ability to switch to different targets when you a tired of hunting a certain type of monster.

There are a ton of items to be found, crafted, and unlocked that have specific uses for specific hunts that make the hunts more manageable and require you to prepare for the hunts properly.  Generally this is true for hunts at your rank or at the upper end of the next one down  (High Rank Pickle will need proper planning even if you are Master Rank for example).

There are also 10 to 12 weapon types which are all very distinct and offer different gameplay styles.  Certain hunts are made easier using certain weapon types which encourages players to try out all of them.  Each weapon had to be constructed from materials collected from the game world and harvested from huntable monsters.  Some of these materials can be hard to obtain, so there is a large amount of grinding introduced; however, the grind is manageable because of the number of possible monsters to hunt.

Overall grind in this game is handled extremely well for a game as grindy as this one.  Lots of thought went into the systems to make this possible and shows an above average understanding of proper game design.  Introduce multiplayer into the mix and the grinding goes from still somewhat tedious to usually fun which is an amazing achievement.

There are a number of features, such as the Trailriders and the Argosy, that make getting monster materials a bit easier and help to reduce the grind slightly.  In addition to this, capturing monsters, using the Hunting Guiide to break breakable parts of monsters, and some other systems allow you to get more parts including a better chance to obtain rarer ones.

One of the best Steam co-op integrations in gaming.  Accept a join request from a message and then hit the menu option.  Very simple, more AAA studios with Steam co-op support need to do this.


The Meh:
The writing in the game isn't that good and neither is the story.  Thankfully the story is pretty irrelevant in this game.

While the grind is one of the better designed aspects of the game there are still some places it could be improved.  This applies mainly around gems and the material tree.  Iceborn weapons require World base weapons and materials to be made.  These weapons should have been placed into their own trees without needing materials from the base game to be made from scratch.

Upgrading from base weapons is fine, but those base weapons should have been the start of the trees.  In addition, augments from the base game seem to be removed when upgraded to Iceborn weapons (I haven;'t actually done this yet because I think that is what happens, so take this with a grain of salt).

The cultivation system makes item material grinding a bit easier, but you can only, as far as I currently know, cultivate two item material types at present so you will still need to farm materials in some cases.

Certain item limits don't make much sense (like certain kinds of traps being limited to 1).

Hit boxes and collision meshes sometimes don't make sense.  For example, cutting off the tail of a monster sometimes still results in that monster being able to hit you with their tail further away that it seems they should be able to.


The Bad:
Monster size scaling can make otherwise normal fights impossible (large Black Diablos for example).  Size has too big of an impact on some stats.  On the other side, smaller monsters are too easy to kill.  Size scaling refers to the size of a monster compared to an average version of that monster, the size varies from hunt to hunt.  This is a good system overall, there were some oversights that make it annoying.

Astra's design is bad.  Things are not laid out in a natural manner, the hub is really bad and looks low effort compared to Seliana's.

Can't set the rank of expeditions (as far as I know).  Expeditions allow you to free hunt/gather materials; materials and monsters will respawn (good feature).  The problem is that they are always scaled to your Hunter Rank and you can't change it so if you wanted to just troll around in low-rank Ancient Woods and beat the shit out of angry Barnies (Anjanaths) for low rank parts, you can't.  You would have to do quests for that which are time and enemy limited.
 

Overall Monster Hunter World is an amazing game with well thought-out systems and game design.  While the stuff that doesn't matter, like the story, is pretty weak, the important systems and features are well designed and offer quality of life features around grinding that put almost all other games to shame.

MHW gets a 9/10 from me and is a must play for any gamer that enjoys simulation adventure games.

i can easily say this is genuinely one of the best Action RPG's ever created.
This game is NOT easy, it'll take a ton work to learn the mechanics of each weapon, and all the individual Monster Fights.
You have 14 weapons to pick from, from a basic Sword and Shield to a fully automatic Chaingun. 
But after you learn the fights, learn your weapons, start getting your builds and gear set up, nothing is as satisfying as putting down the guy who's been kicking your butt all night, and turning him into a pair of pants.

This was actually my first Monster Hunter experience, I don’t remember how it started but I don’t think it’ll ever really end, and I’m here to enjoy that fact. 

I played this game with the glaive, swinging it around like a little monkey man to begin and breaking every monster’s back doing air combos by the end. Couldn’t be a more fun and potentially chaotic way to play, I never have a bad time and my party members don’t mind some
easy mounts from that. 
I dipped into Hammer as well. Simple, effective, incredibly painful (it definitely looks to be). The visual of sliding down a slope and then suddenly launching into a charged hammer roll only to bonk a monster, or even get a mount, is something wonderful and hard to beat.

I fought and I captured and I most definitely blew up many monsters on the way, to Iceborne and the guiding lands. I can say confidently that the Guiding Lands are an incredible piece of late/endgame content. Refreshing, honestly very rewarding, and the pinnacle of how I imagine World, an endless run around with everything at your disposal, constantly collecting materials and hunting Kulu Ya Ku and the occasional Elder that pops in.

I think this game is worth the time. I played it mostly with friends but had many solo moments that were just as rewarding.",1704380811,1704380811,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
