General synopsis is just Build a school, manage your staff, profit from students.

Overall differences from hospital is that you can build outside, decorate until your hearts content, with many different courses there is so much more flexibility in your style of game play, whether you love playing slow, decorating and letting your students run wild, or playing fast and chaotic, trying to maximise your profits, there's many different ways to play. 

Between Campus and Hospital, Campus plays much more relaxed to its hospital counterpart, you have much more control over everything, how many students come in at any point, you can adjust the buildings and sizes to fit your needs, and once youre set up you can just let it run and watch how the year plays out.",1705700116,1705700116,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The graphics and the general feel/aesthetic is very goofy and lighthearted. That makes the game perfect for unwinding and generally chilling and enjoying your time while playing it. I love the creativity behind every little goofiness, from the radio hosts to the little cute animations the students make while interacting with various items.

I also love how it feels rich and unending. Every time I think I've reached a point where the grinding and repetitiveness starts, the game changes up the beat. Granted, I've played around 30hrs yet, but it has managed to capture my attention more than 10 hours and I'm still excited for new things, so I count that as a win!

It has its challenges, but they're manageable and they don't take you away from the fun of the game, nor jolt you out of the immersion out of frustration. If you are looking for a more hardcore managing and challenging game, then this is not for you. 

Some people have mentioned that it gets repetitive sometimes, but in my own experience, it shifts up the things the exact right moment. It does have a pattern indeed, but not to the point that everything becomes boring. 

Overall, it's a goofy, lighthearted, chilling game, that takes you managing your own campus and giving you the satisfaction of watching it thrive. It can get challenging, but not to the point it takes the fun and chill out of it.

It takes effing forever to upgrade Employees and Buildings for no Reason and you CANNOT upgrade them before a new Term, so its always Chaos each Semester.

If you're like me, and you found 2.Campus through 2.Hospital, which you found after years of trying to chase after a game that felt like Theme Hospital... then parts of you will be happy, and parts will be very very sad. (If this is you, just do yourself a favour and download EA games, actual Theme Hospital is on there). This review is HEAVILY influenced by wanting the game to be a school version of Theme Hospital...

2.Campus is like they took Theme Hospital, gutted the personality and gameplay and challenge from it, slapped on a 'school' skin, and sold it back to us. There's still the sarcastic announcer and whimsical rooms, but there's no... idk.. depth? 

So, like, for example, instead of shooting rats, gaining you access to a secret rat shooting hospital, and trying to get the janitor to clean blood splatters, and not being sure if covering rat holes with chairs is 'cheating' like in Theme Hospital, in 2.Campus, you 'collect bookworms'. No blood spatter. No secret school (to the best of my knowledge). Barely any book worms (they seem to appear at random, not through littering). Just... worms for the sake of worms?

Instead of emergencies and pandemics and people dying left right and centre on you, followed by a reputation hit, you get... idk some knights that invade sometimes that as far as I can tell have absolutely zero negative impact and are very easy to deal with and not a challenge at all (which... I think the writers are even aware of, since the response to winning is a message in your inbox along the lines of 'did you even notice they were there? I didn't!')

I'm also just... really disliking kudosh (the new currency earned by... not sure what... research sometimes, random events sometimes? It enables you to 'unlock' access to items that your students will ask for.) The whole concept of this seems like it's adding a barrier for the sake of adding a barrier? Like, it's not really something you can work towards, it's not something that brings an extra level of realism (or an extra level of creativity/ humour), it's just preventing you accessing everything all at once for no good reason?

Instead of having to plan and think for yourself 'Do I need more GPs offices? Or do I just need to plan more effectively? Do I delete this room, and build a whole new room? How is that going to impact my budget?', The game actually forces you to build a specific number of each type of room each year, and you can just pick up rooms and drop them. Like, they just remove that whole planning aspect of the game play, which.... like... that's the game. That's what a management sim IS.

Also, levels. What on earth is a level? It's not a grade, that's A-F, and is in the game. It's not a year, that's also in the game, Is a level 3 grade A better than a level 6 grade F? Are they even comparable in that way? My students seem to be achieving them without me even knowing what they are? 

Overall the game is also just... way too easy. Granted I have only done about 4/6 of the schools, but there's been zero challenge there so far. Sometimes I run low on money near the start because it comes at me with requirements at the start of second year that I had no foreshadowing about whatsoever that need to be built STRAIGHT AWAY, but never to the point of having a disaster (even if your students miss their first class, they can still pass), and you make so much money you make enough to build it by the time there's a second class, and you quickly find yourself with so much money that you end up buying buildings you have no use for just to pump your school 'level' up so you can level up your classes. Seems impossible to bankrupt yourself (you earn so much money through xp that it just overrides over-staffing).

Here's some things I feel like the original writers of Theme Hospital would have included in this game if they'd written it: Alcohol, leading to mood increase and risk of vomitting. Food poisoning, leading to the squits. An area overview that describes what sort of students live in the local area, so that you tailor the courses in your campus to the needs, rather than.. being able to just provide one subject at the school and that's totally fine and fulfils win conditions. Rats. Reputation (Having a bunch of A+ students or D students should feel like it matters and it doesn't feel like it matters atm). 

Here's some things I do like: 

I like that you can edit the buildings. You can add more entrances, you can make the buildings themselves bigger or smaller or different shapes. This cures the annoyance of ... having to plan around the building, which, yes, is again kind of what the game is, but I think is fine if not combined with everything else. 

I like that outside is now a thing. Like, there's proper use for outdoor areas, so you have to plan if you want things inside or outside, and build buildings accordingly, and fresh air contributes to the health of your students. This is actually pretty neat :)

Clubs are pretty cute. Students get perks for extra curricular activities, which need access to specific items. They also make sense in the environment - universities really do have clubs, and has some creative whimsy to it to make it have gameplay value. Same goes for events, and I like that they can be course specific competitions, because again it makes sense for the environment and introduces a challenge (nearly, it's not difficult enough to actually be particularly challenging, but it's the thought that counts. I have had to repeat some of the events once to win them, but it lays it all out a bit too clearly for my taste, there's no risk at all if you just bother to read the in-game suggestions, which I did not).

I'd say overall the game feels like it was made for a much younger audience, but to be real, I was about 9 when I played Theme Hospital, and found it a challenge, but beatable, so I guess if we're looking for an easier version of that, maybe the target audience is about 7-8? 

Also there's a regularly occurring bug where a student will be stuck and not move, for no apparent reason (even when expelled). And an additional bug where students simply... don't attend Palooza (unless you quit and restart). And another bug where students passing some courses (?) don't count as 'students passing' (solved the same way). It looks like you need to restart every single year.",1703635873,1704318142,False,6,0,0.590605735778808594,0,True,False,False

really liked the game and the different scenarios to getting your goals done, not only through tuition and rent. The fields of studies were pretty funny and silly as expected in a two point game. Same goes for the announcement and commercials that play during the game. 

the controls and camera handling is pretty intuitive if you have played similiar games. 

In order not to dump too much on the game, id rather call it suggestions for a better experience:

-mods only through ingame hub, that didnt work half of time, just use steam workshop
-game was too long and dragged out at times, especially given mechanics and win options. Too many times your goal for the 3 Star Rating was getting a certain number of graduants with a certain grade. In the last mission i need 100 A+ Students to graduate, and yeah i got 99 no kidding, so i had to sit through one more year of doing nothing cause i already had all the other goals achieved, and i am not the ""i am gotta create a nice looking park meanwhile"". It would be nice to have a certain way to shortcut that by making people graduate earlier. Also they should have come up with more goals that are different from get that much money/get this many graduats or the worst get this amount of attractivness. Go for something like: Super room - get a room to prestige level 15, or train a certain employee in a certain skill to the max.
-different studies didnt matter really outside of their mission, most of the time you had no incentive to go for the special courses cause they require a lot of extra rooms and dont give any benefits. How about making the cooking course enabling fullfillment of all students without the need for food stands etc.  
- too much micro management, how about towards the end of the game you unlock certain room designs that come with a certain prestige and inventory, plastering posters and carpets everywhere for the attractivness score is no fun. In the end i just copied my old rooms cause i couldnt be bothered to custom fit them for the occasion.  
- automated training of staff would have been good or the option of them just doing training in a random field
- game was too easy, yeah i am not one advocating for somebody to ragequit out of frustration. The hardest part was always the start ending up me sometimes having all loans taken, but paying them off was no problem and after certain stage the game was just coasting cause no real bad events happened that couldnt be solved by time or money. So maybe they should have added stuff like student protests, student groups fighting each other,  striking personel, earthquakes destroying buildings or you having to swap your courses completly cause some event occured.
- many feature pointless: staff happiness (didnt give anyone a raise ever, no problem), seperation of libary/dorms for different student groups, marketing (most of the time didnt even build it)

+/-*While it's great you can inspect individual students, there's almost no reason to do so.
+/-You will eventually reach a point where it's impossible to keep tabs on what's happening between the students.
+/-The staff control is almost nothing. The staff is also super easily satisfied.
-Once you reach the later levels, the demands get insane. It's possible to have a great and dominating year and get totally fucked by the campus demands for the following year.
-The student demands get insane late into the game. It's great to have 60 days to get stuff, and arrange events, worth over 100k.
-You'll reach a point where there's almost no gameplay to be enjoyed.
-Getting super high ratings is a pain. For instance, attractiveness is a weird stat. Your campus can look like shit and still have a high attractiveness rating because you just have so much stuff on walls etc.
?Is the previous Hospital game better? Gotta find out!

Two Point Campus is a better simulation game than Sims, with some automated flaws to it. While it's not perfect, it's still a great game. The game gets repetitive only after you've played it for a long time. I do want more of this. 8,5/10.",1703957375,1704034297,True,4,1,0.573478102684020996,0,True,False,False

A game I'd give a neutral recommendation to if I could. I liked this at first, and it is not a terrible game.

My problem with it mainly is that is far too easy.

All you really need to do is make a horrible barracks room to pile in the students instead of a nice living area, and you'll just roll in money. After that it's just making the rooms the game tells you to, some utility rooms and scatter some silly items around the corridors and you're done until the year ends.

Chasing the 3 stars on each level wasn't hard but took time. On one level I had to wait 5 years for enough A+ students to graduate with really nothing to do in between.

Comparing it to the fantastic Two Point Hospital the big difference with Campus is the lack of a visually obvious flow. A production line if you will. The students enter the campus and don't leave until they graduate. This switches the focus to something more abstract when comparing it to Two Point Hospital's patients. You could even compare it to The Sims in this regard.

It takes some getting used to. And for a while I couldn't get into it and actually shelved it for along time. But I kept going back to it every now and again, because there's so much in the game I love. And a few levels in it all started to click. There is a flow, but it's not obvious. And it is a bit more difficult than Hospital in that regard. But it's still very much a relaxing game. I like that. It's great for kicking back.

And even when there's not much for you to do but wait for the next opportunity to expand it is a lot of fun simply listening to the radio stations (they are friggin' hilarious!) and just look at the students running around doing all this silly stuff. The game is incredibly detailed! I love this!

Ther're ways to make the students more efficient in their pursuit of knowledge. So it's all about managing those things. The better you get at this, the more money you will get due XP and other factors (it changes depending on the levels).

TL;DR 
The update alleviates one of my previous grievance of the game which is the severe restriction on how many students can be in school at any given year. I can recommend this game for now. It will satisfy many simulation fans in its current state. Personally however, I am not satisfied with the current update and refrain from buying any DLCs in the future. Read below for full details. 


Full review:
Previously, only a max of 150 students can exist at any given year. Now the limit is increased to 600. 
Granted that this is a significant increase , it still pales on the theoretical number of students if all courses are maxed. In the base game (no DLC) , there are 17 courses of a total 46 course years. At max level, each course year can accept about 55 students. That brings the theoretical number of students to 2,530 every year. The current limit doesn't even reach 25% of the theoretical number.

This is a symptom of my biggest disappointment for the game. 
I have a goal to reach the top limit of what the game has to offer , which in this case to [b][h1]achieve max level for all courses. [/h1][/b]
Unfortunately, this seems to be impossible even with the latest update. 
You need almost 6,400 course points to upgrade all 17 courses. However, this is impossible to achieve.
There seems to be a max campus level of 101 in the game. This translates to a max 1,000 course points only. 
If playing on creative, there's an extra 1,000 point , bringing the total to 2,000. That still falls short of the needed total points. 
It was impossible to achieve max level on all courses legitimately. 
The situation is even worse if counting future DLC courses.

There's a lot to like here. The typically great and cynical humour of the first game is again present, this time regarding higher education, and the game is just a lot of fun front to back. 

I really like the fact that you can now edit and create entire buildings (something that was not present in 'Two Point Hospital'). This is great because it's still a challenge to fit buildings on plots, etc but at least the unnecessary challenge of fitting your rooms within a static blueprint in the prior game is gone. This is something I am very thankful for since the rooms can once again get crazy big with the required items or to max out on performance/room level. 

The updated staff training model is a welcome fix but I still think I prefer the usual 5 slots of training for staff in 'Hospital' over this one. Instead you now get 3 separate slots that can each go up to level 10 to combine 30 total training points, if that makes sense. Now you can train staff up to Research level 10 or Maintenance level 10 for example and while I like the idea of there being the ability to make specialists with other skill points, I do think I prefer in 'Hospital' where you might have a Surgeon maxed out at level 5 only (since you only have 5 slots) or again maintenance level 5 maxed out. It just gives you that moment where a staff is fully trained whereas here in 'Campus' staff can train up to 30 total and it can take a while to get them there - as well as the added challenge of only having 5 slots so it forces you to choose wisely. I'm sure there is a decent in between of the two methods, but for now I don't hate it. if anything, I wish that the 'soft' skills like happiness and comic relief played more significant roles than I feel they do, since I more prefer to upgrade staff with the hard skills like their courses or etc. 

I wish there was a better UI for managing your staff and students. You can't filter students by course (oddly enough) but you can filter your teachers by courses that they teach, but you have to actually type the name into the prompt (???). Why not let me just click a button to only show me teachers trained to teach General Knowledge for example? Why must I have to type the name of the course in to start a filtered list? I also wish there was the ability to send all your staff or your staff by profession (teachers, admin, janitors, etc.) to go to break all at once for example, like you could in 'Hospital'. This would make a lot of sense especially at the end of school years during the break when they can rest up for the new year. Little fixes such as this and others would go a long way. 

There are still the usual more tedious public funded levels where you have to earn money through challenges and there are no tuition or rent paid directly to you. That's fine and a great challenge model but I wish that the actual ways to earn money were better and that it was a better and less annoying system. 

The game can tend to get repetitive like the previous entry, but that's to be expected sometimes with these sorts of simulation games as once you basically understand the flow and the way to play it, it becomes the challenge of honing your management skills and attempting different strategies to win your stars. It's not a bad thing that a game like this is repetitive, at least to me, but I do think there's always ways to change things up. 

Of the DLC, I would rate the current ones: ""School Spirits"" > ""Space Academy"" > ""Medical School"". School Spirits has some pretty fun levels and I'm always here for spooky nonsense, and I generally like the vibe of those levels as well. Space Academy is pretty good, but not quite as iconic for me and there's a few levels in that DLC that I wasn't the biggest fan of. Medical School is by and large the worse of the three since it feels very much like a lazy rehash of ""Two Point Hospital"". Even the assets in this game and the legit equivalents from the prior game, such as the room items in Surgery or the Ward for example. There are a few rooms carried over such as Surgery, Ward, Injection Room, Psychiatry, etc and like I said the assets are literally the exact same. The gameplay is exactly the same too where you accept patients but unlike in 'Hospital', there's no ways to actually manage the patients since this is a totally different system to that game. You have systems to manage students and staff but not for patients since that was never built into the base game in the first place. The levels aren't the best either, such as that publicly funded level or the one where you have to appease the volcano? Honestly it's a no from me. This DLC is entirely skippable but the other two are worth picking up, especially School Spirits. 

All in another, this is another fabulous entry in the series to dive into. I'm pleasantly looking forward to future DLC in this one and the sequel with wherever the devs take us to.

Enter Two Point Campus. This game is all about customization, especially in the buildings itself! The fact we can build our own buildings and move entrances has been such a game changer and makes it so much more enjoyable. TPH use to give you a very set building size and shape and you couldn't move anything. This game encourages it! I love it! 

Plus the actual gameplay seems so much more fun and less micromanaging. Yes, there are still some things I wish you could change, but overall I have been having a blast with this game and completely enjoying it! I even bought a copy for my brother to enjoy and we've been sharing our campuses with each other!

Quite disappointed with this one because...it's just no fun. The game doesn't give you any challenge whatsoever. It kinda plays itself and you spend most of the school year on faster speed, waiting for it to be over. Sometimes, the game will even make you take stupid decisions (ie saying you have to hire more teachers to be allowed to start a new year when the ones you already have are already roaming the corridors looking for work). 

Plus it doesn't look like a recent game. I instantly found it less beautiful than Two Point and I feel like there are very few items to personalize the different rooms (which would have been the only fun part remaining ). 

If you've never played Two Point before and if it's on sale, I guess it would be worth the shot but I regret purchasing it.",1700809984,1700809984,False,2,0,0.513888895511627197,0,True,False,False

And honestly, that’s really disappointing. Lest you think I’m just some casual hater, let me assure you that I [i]adored[/i] Two Point Hospital. The easy listening soundtrack, distinctive graphical style and awful dad jokes were a great combination. I spent hundreds of hours as the world’s weirdest hospital administrator and I loved it.

Two Point Campus still brings these great qualities, but the change in theme absolutely [i]destroys[/i] the fun. A hospital is a fast-paced environment - people pay per treatment, and sometimes they die in the corridors, or you run out of money, or your nurses all quit. Healthcare is dramatic! A campus, by contrast, is sedate…calm…and dull.

Where TPH makes you react, TPC doesn’t really care what you do. You can’t mess up your economy, what with staff wages being so low and course fees being a yearly charge. High achieving students happen more or less automatically, and it’s hard to design yourself into a corner. It’s almost impossible to lose, which sucks the fun out of it. During a semester, the game plays itself. Yawn!

Even if you're more of a builder and don’t care so much about gameplay, you’ll probably find the design of TPC a step backwards. TPH has strange exotic diseases like plagues that would pixelate or dancing fevers. TPC offers cooking courses where students dress like chefs, and robotics courses where students do ‘the robot’. It’s less creative and less interesting. The same blandness shows up in the classrooms, the university clubs and the entertainment options.

Interesting management systems were stripped away. The pacing was butchered. The personality and immersion factors were toned down significantly. It’s sad, but Two Point Campus is a shallow imitation of its predecessor, a vessel to flog DLC rather than a fully-realized project. It earns a resounding ‘meh’.",1699716160,1699716442,False,32,1,0.717386543750762939,0,True,False,False

Even in the game, some controls are fine but its like its trying to force a controller.  its 2023.  If I haven't used a controller, I'm obviously inputting controls from a mouse and keyboard, why is it just auto defaulting to controller?  Almost any other game I play, if I use the mouse and keyboard the game is smart enough to just default and use those controls.  Same with the controller.  Most games you don't even have to swap in the menu, the game just picks up whatever inputs you are putting in and makes the adjustment.  

I guess that is to hard for this game.  said I have 60 mins in the game?  BS.  I have like 10 and the rest is looking up how to make it start using mouse and keyboard instead of just auto defaulting to controller.  wtf I am so frustrated at this game.

I also bought it on sale as well, so that factors into my value for money / enjoyment. 

As you can imagine, you are in charge of starting and building a school to produce quality students and also money for you, which you can then use to further improve the place either through staff training, better equipment for your classrooms or decorations to make the place look more pleasing to the eye.  I struggle and continue to struggle on getting the attractiveness of the place up, especially when it rains frogs or there's some other kind of natural disaster so it would be good to have the ability to turn this feature off, along with the temperature moderation which means you have to put radiators or A/C units all over the place, which is a bit of a chore.

One of the things I do like is that you're not pigeonholed into how you set up your school.  Yes, there are some campuses where you need to meet certain requirements in a specific subject, but that doesn't mean you have to solely focus on that subject.  Looking at one campus, I have one doing archaeology, V.R. and Robotics, whereas one of my online friends is doing archaeology and cooking.  Another is doing archaeology only and someone else is doing archaeology and clown school, so you get the idea.

There are tool tips to help you complete your requirements, but some of them are a bit vague and so you may spend hours doing year after year of classes but not attaining them, which is rather frustrating.  You can look on the help section on steam, but I'm at 3.5 million in the black, have played 12 years on a specific campus but still can't get the final star to complete the level.

This is not an ideal choice for 100% completionists, because you have to buy the DLC to get the remaining achievements, which is rather annoying.

The DLC content looks like a fun extension to the game, but I won't buy that until it goes on sale.",1693218014,1694626875,True,21,2,0.727592945098876953,0,True,False,False

This game is definitely different from Hospital but it was just as enjoyable for me. I liked that it was possible to change the building layout and to construct our own buildings. It's been a constant annoyance in the Hospital game that you'd get an odd layout and have to fit very large rooms into it. I also liked that there weren't many ""busy tasks"" like the vaccination/outbreak in the Hospital games. I'm on the last level (without DLC) and so far there was only one similar event. I also enjoyed the radio and funny announcements, similar to Hospital game.

On a not so minus side, there is some missed potential. I'd like to have more interaction with the students and to see them use the items placed around the campus. Otherwise I'd create a very nice area outside but for unknown reason, it never gets used. It's also a bit annoying that the students want many different kiosks and each requires an assistant but for most part it just stands there and barely gets used. The rooms are also overall more expensive and larger than in the Hospital game. And you have to meet certain requirements just to progress to the next year. I had to take loans very frequently in this game.

Overall I found this game fun and worth the discounted price I paid (MSRP is a bit too much IMHO for what you get).",1693624390,1693624390,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I feel like Hospital had a few too many DLCs, but when they were on sale, it was a good chunk of content for a reasonable price, so I have no problem with Campus following in Hospital's footsteps in that regard. Finish the base game, come back in a few years and buy a whole bunch of DLC for a few bucks and get basically as much new content as the base game had. Fine business model by me. Not too greedy and yet profitable for the developers. Win-Win. I prefer this approach to the constant early access titles that plague this genre, where you're playing unfinished games and getting essential and quality of life features drip-fed over months/years. Two Point Studios release fully featured very well polished games, which are only getting more content post-release.

My biggest wish there were more customizing options early on that you didn't have to pay your hard earned k to unlock.  I super love customizing so each Campus to have it's own look but early on there was just the default and your k points need to go for more important things (education upgrades) so campuses all looked ugly. Was pretty late in the game before I was able to unlock all the decorations (well have yet to unlock all of them).   The achievements were very doable and I like how some campuses had extremely different income methods so that you had to break out of your fixed mode of early game/start up.   I was able to get get all the original campuses up to 3 stars and have only got the last two med school campuses to get to 3 stars (not a big fan of the lava campus as the island doesn't give you much time and you cannot 'choose another' like with the yeti - seems my janitors are always fighting fires...)

First off, I appreciate that this game runs natively on a Mac, as I mostly game on console, but this is one genre I don't like to play on a game pad.

I felt that the game did a great job of remaining engaging and having genuinely new challenges for each campus. The early game was always a lot of fun, trying to get your campus in working order, with so many things to think about and plan around. It's really like a game of The Sims where you have 100 sims at once. Each student and staff member operates entirely on their own agendas to meet their needs and act out on their unique traits, and you have to set things up to help them succeed, rather than micromanage.

I'm especially impressed with how the game schedules classes and staff tasks for you, so you never have to worry about monotonous details, you just need to provide the facilities. It will simply let you know when you need to build another room to keep the proper schedule, but you never need to even understand WHY you need the rooms if you don't care to look deeper into it. Janitors will always find work to do without you needing to touch them. You can manually assign them to something, but you could easily complete the game without having to direct them. 

You may be thinking that if the game is too automated, surely you won't have enough to do, but that's not true at all. I rarely got to stop providing rooms and items for my students. Arranging my rooms, expanding, tweaking positions of things, adding new things when students were having problems. There are so many avenues you could experience problems in with your campus just on a basic level that all of those finer automated details feel really good rather than taking anything away from the experience.

I had read that the game wasn't challenging enough, but it can be if you want to engage with the challenge modes, or you get deeper into the campaign or DLCs. The final campus of the medical school DLC is extremely tough. Still, even as the game may be a little below average in difficulty, it always feels utterly engaging and satisfying to get your campus running smoothly.

There are some things that get excessively tedious if you wish to 3 star campuses. If it asks you to raise your attractiveness rating, prepare to place hundreds of posters, rugs, and endless other things to meet that requirement. I understand why this is a thing. They give you all those kinds of things to make your campus look nice, so you should use them, right? I just wish there were some way to automate some of that. I don't personally care about decorating my campus to the degree that it wants, so why not a button to just automatically slap posters and stuff on the walls of a room for me? Maybe it's something they can do in another version. Not a game breaking issue, and for this genre of game, it's really not worse than what the competition has you do at times.",1692945759,1693002005,True,37,0,0.809408843517303467,0,True,False,False

This is my third school management PC game that I ever play, and I do have a high hope for it since it come from the same developer of Two Point Hospital, and all of my school management game before is such a blast. So, as expected, if I compare it with Two Point Hospital, the graphic is nice, the animation is great, and it is clearly that a lot of thing have been added. The new mechanic that I like it the ability to freely expand or create new building as you wish, including the ability to place thing outdoor.

Although, there is a lot of variation of education type for you to choose, such as cooking, science, engineering, sports, etc. but most of them feel the same, the only different is the art style of room for each class. And one of the most annoying thing for me is student request. Why? let's say you are building a cool medieval theme school with a lot of wood and iron things for your chivalry and wizardly class. And then your student ask for a pink hearth shape bench, which break all the theme you try to create.

And, I think this game is quiet easy, probably too easy. The fact that I finish every school with 3 stars under 100 hours, compare to Two Point Hospital which I spend almost 200 hours, prove that this game is a lot easy than the hospital one.

Still, I like the game, and it does give me a happy time while playing, I guess that is all the matter to give this game a thumb up.",1692546815,1692546815,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

That said, Its not overly challenging. And like the hospital, once you unlock a building that isn't tied to a class topic, you'll need to build it in every map. Often, many of the same rooms: like the doctor room (aka school nurse), or the ""pastoral room"" aka counselor room. 

Otherwise, you just spam posters and make sure the temp is right and you will get a good score. The hardest part is making sure to unlock the right objects, which is really kind of a false gate.

The different campuses in the campaign do a great job at introducing all the different classes available and, with a bit, of clicking around you can easily figure out what classes have overlapping needs and that helps to build a very efficient campus.
Student wants are pretty easy to see and some of the unique effects from different locations and effects that come with different courses (such as double agents when doing the spy classes) keep things interesting.

I've only encountered a few bugs so far:
1. Occasionally the pathing AI, at least I'm guess its the pathing AI, will break and this causes students to just stand still. The student will still lose happiness because they will continue to build up needs such as food or shower and will eventually drop out from the school. Even after dropping out the student will just stand there. They seem to disappear eventually, so I think the game just despawns them after a set time.
2. When copying over rooms there are times that some of the items have placement issues that are not present in the original room. This can happen when copying from a saved room and from a room that was built new then copied over. It seems more common if a room is copied and then rotated for placement needs.",1691938942,1691938942,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

These days I still love to get lost in one of them from time to time. Luckily, nowadays some good modern games exist that (almost) bring back those nostalgic feelings of the classics, namely; Planet Coaster, City Skylines and Parkitect. In my opinion, Two Point Campus (and Two Point Hospital) also fit in that list.

Two Point Campus does not differ that much from Two Point Hospital, it's basically the same game but with a lot more options when it comes to customisation and obviously you are not running a hospital now. 

Building your campus and design it the way you like, who doesn't love that? Oh yeah and try to keep students/staff happy while you are at it. 
Really enjoyed the different missions, each in their own unique location and challenges. Some missions have cold weather, some hot, some have earthquakes or people invading your campus etc. 

The only complaint I have (if you can call it one) is that the game is incredibly easy. I guess you could get bankrupt but it never happened to me. Even when I was being careless and bought the wrong items etc. somehow I still could turn things around and make a huge profit. 
Not every game has to be difficult but I'm just 'Two'-pointing that out. 

Overall, I think this is a really fun game that anyone who loves the genre would enjoy.",1691485566,1691485566,True,1,0,0.516129076480865479,0,True,False,False

The only thing that I do not like in this game is that every single npc is male and that feels a little bit more like gay game. One advise to developers, add unique NPCs both males and females so the game can feel a little bit more realistic and they can interact with each other like in real university. Add a variance of animations for the npc's and make the game more alive than it is. The biggest problem with the game is not the gameplay. It is the gay part of it, it won't be hard to reduce it a little bit by adding female npc's(students).

Gameplay is casual and repetitive, perfect for people who want to relax and watch how your students interact and manage their performance in different classes.
Graphics are lovely and interface, and game tools are simple to use
There is a campaing in which you can manage different style of universities.
NPCs are only male and this is the biggest con in this game.

Overall I can give the game rate of 7/10 and a positive rate, but if the issue with locked npc's gender is not solved I will give a negative review.

The idea of running a campus is great and the devs have truly put a lot of effort into making everything alive and funny. The game plays fluent and most bugs are resolved quickly (1-2 weeks) on Steam.
As per my opening line, the game is not as engaging as TP Hospital. Mainly because you tend to build during the Summer vacation period and when the break is over, you can more or less sit back, relax and watch everything in action. This is not bad, though you typically do not need to intervene when classes are going, apart from fulfilling wishes from students throughout the year (ie schedule a party or place a specific object somewhere). This can make a gameplay a bit boring from time to time, especially when you are after a specific star which requires you to go through multiple years.
Still I recommend this game as it is packed with humor and looks, plays and feels great. Am sure we will get some more DLC in the next 1-2 years to keep the game fresh and entertaining.

It´s a very uncommon bug, but if it hapens to you, don´t do nothing with the game, just contant support. 

Two Point Campus is the second installement in the Two Point series after Hospital, but it´s a completely different beast. You are now tied to a 12 month period, your students won´t leave (hopefully) for the whole year, and it´s your job to provide them with the items and rooms that will help them improve their notes for tose 12 months. While a lot of the difficulty on Hospital was releated to placement of rooms, in here that´s less relevant and it´s money the biggest learning curve, you have to build your campus slowly or you are gonna end up asking for tons of loans, which is a feature I never used on Hospital.

There´s also more improvements in the system, now buildings are not fixxed and you can modify them as you please, and outdoor enviorements take a huge role. I particularly like the staff training improvements, you will no longer pay for a classroom, now you will have machinery and staff will go automatically when they are free, and they can come out of the machine without loosing progress on their leveling up.

If you enjoyed TPH, I´m sure you will do the same for TPC, although it´s true it´s a little bit easier, some of the new mechanics are very interesting and it´s great to see the team being able to translate the gameplay into different micromanagement styles. This game makes me excited about a third installement on the series and many many more.",1688496314,1689000039,True,8,2,0.537456095218658447,0,True,False,False

A lot of the same ideas from TPH work in this game too, but notably while in TPH you wanted to get patients through the system as fast as possible, in TPC you're stuck with your students for three years, so things that distracted your patients from getting to where they needed to be in TPH are actually nice to have in TPC.

In TPH you wanted the smallest rooms possible; in TPC some rooms have a variable capacity based on size, so you'll want bigger rooms than the minimum for things like your student union or your library.

Some things are still bad, though, like plants that require maintenance (though students can help with that in TPC), or marketing, which was okay in TPH but is barely useful in TPC.

General:

Always make sure you have at least a couple hundred kudosh in reserve; you get notifications for students wanting things to be placed all the time, and if you unlock those objects willy-nilly you'll end up short when a student needs you to unlock and place an object that's necessary for their coursework.

Being outside improves student health, so try to put as much stuff between buildings as possible, like clubs or food stands.

Classrooms can only handle multiples of 8 students at a time, so be sure to only admit students each year in multiples of 8. Otherwise you'll be hiring extra staff and building extra classrooms for almost-empty classes.

Similarly, crank the tuition fees as high as you can while still being able to take 8/16/24 students to maximize revenue - the happiness penalty isn't very severe.

Students pay tuition, but they also pay rent, and the nicer the dorms, the higher the rent, so be sure to crank your dorms' prestige level as high as you can. It's easier and cheaper to have one big dorm than a bunch of small ones as a result.

Every course has classes in lecture halls, so improving the prestige of lecture halls and prioritizing their upgrades gets more total benefit than other classrooms.

You can add and remove tiles from your buildings now, which helps greatly with fitting the many differently-shaped rooms.

Each type of student has a passive that can help around the campus. Swots help with other students' grades, while Rebels might perform some percussive maintenance to fix up broken objects. The more different courses, the more variety of students, the more you can benefit from these passive abilities.

Clubs:

The tutorial says you need an assistant manning a club recruitment stand; you actually don't, assistants just prioritize students joining that club.

Each club provides a bonus to movement speed, energy, learning rate, cash, or entertainment. Depending on the map, some clubs might be more useful than others, but the Book Club improving your students' learning rate is useful on every map.

Students will occasionally just stop moving and stand in one spot until they drop out because they wont fulfil any needs or go to pastoral care, even after dropping out they don't move until they randomly disappear. (an evicted student that just stands there doing nothing).

I really loved Two Point Hospital and I thought this would be as enjoyable but the gameplay is less interesting than Hospital.
It kinda feels that the game plays by itself and you won't make a real difference. You're just a witness of a computer having fun with himself :-D

You get a fixed number of students per year and per course level. You can have several different course on the same year if you want to or one course at high level (more students for this course).
The students don't really own a bed, they share it and only use them when they feel tired.
And, you have to build a lecture room and a specific room related to the course. or maybe a second type for the 2nd year and 3rd year.
The planning of all this is automatically built by the game.
Add a library for all courses so that student can improve their marks and that is all.
Rince, repeat.

The animations are not really funny compared to the fun and creativity of the Hospital game.
A lot of asset reused which I don't mind.
The staff is anecdotical, as you need 2 teachers for many students.
But you need a lot of assistants and janitors.

Research is unlocked only after the third stage.

Most of the time, you'll receive a request from a student ""I want a bench to make-out with people, can you do that"" ?
Ok, placing a bench. Anyone needs anything else ?

There was a sense of efficiency and a bit of pressure in Two Point Hospital that is entirely lost here, no difficulty.
Not even sure how useful it is to increase the level of the students as they all pass anyway all years without perfect professors and upgraded rooms. So I'm not seeing the point.

Not bad, just not engaging. It's much more fun to get a DLC from two point hospital than this new game actually.",1688915773,1688915773,False,131,5,0.870987474918365479,2,True,False,False

it is super repetitive and redundant and I'm not even sure how to give examples because I don't know what it is. I can't put my finger on it.

it's no different than 2PH where you have a designated place to put the things you unlock, except now you have to build it yourself... just always at the same point in time. the only solution I've found is to bulldoze the entire map and rebuild from scratch, but can't do that til you've accumulated the funds to spend, and then by that point the map is almost completed so what is the point lol

The rooms and hiring aspect is pretty much the same, controlling staff and training them (although the training seemed unlimited to me as long as you have the cash), but the actual guts of this game are focused around the school year and the courses you are running. I loved that you always had a choice to run a second, third, fourth, etc course on each level and as long as you had the cash to back up the rooms and teachers no ducks were given and you could do what you wanted. 
I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone who loved 2PH or anyone who likes full control of each level and is goal oriented.

Two Point Campus (2022) is the sophomore release from Two Point Studios, following up their 2018 Theme Hospital spiritual successor, Two Point Hospital. Taking inspiration from isometric sim games of yore but this time adding a twist on it instead of mostly just reimplementing Theme Hospital, Two Point Campus is a fun romp that fixes a lot of the issues with TPH, while remaining bogged down by others.

In Two Point Campus, you take the role as a campus administrator, responsible for hiring and firing staff and faculty, building rooms and buildings, and accepting students. The game is broken up into years, each of which takes about 20 minutes of real time, during which students will go from class to class, increasing their grades while spending time between classes to take care of their needs. This is a big difference compared to Two Point Hospital - in TPH, every patient entering your hospital started a timer to cure them before their health meter hit zero and they kicked the bucket (or were otherwise distressed enough to leave, but most of the time death was the major clock). This had a counterintuitive effect on the game - the menus were filled to the brim with all sorts of cute and fun items to please your patients, few of which you actually wanted to use because patients getting distracted just meant the gentle embrace of death grew that much nearer. TPC, on the other hand, has you stuck with your students for multiple years, and you need to keep them happy enough that they don't drop out, and smart enough that they don't flunk out in order to keep that sweet, sweet tuition and dorm rent money flowing. So while it was okay to let your patients starve in TPH, in TPC that's a quick way to get a bunch of depressed teenagers dropping out. Additionally, students also have their own personal goals they want to see while at college - something like seeing a concert, or getting into a relationship, or just looking at a nice hedge shaped like a duck, so you'll be placing all sorts of fun flavor items around the campus to satisfy those whims. Overall, a good change and it really helps make your campus feel like a campus!

Another good change from its predecessor is the way TPC handles rooms. In TPH, you needed to build rooms to complete actions, usually either diagnosis or treatment. In place of those categories, TPC has courses which each use one or more different kinds of rooms. A student in the Money Wrangling program has classes in a Lecture Hall and a Computer Lab, but a student in the Musicality program has classes in a Lecture Hall, Computer Lab, and a Recording Studio. Each course has its own requirements, and savvy players may even provide courses whose rooms complement each other, helping avoid unnecessary extra construction. However, students don't just need a room - they also need that room to have certain objects within, usually requiring bigger and more expensive items in later courses. While your first-year Scientography students will be fine with just a Science Hub, your third-years will need the large and expensive Microscope or Thunder Balls in the classroom in order to keep their grades up. In TPH, you almost never wanted to make a room bigger than the absolute bare minimum size allowed, with only a few limited exceptions for rooms that could operate in parallel off a single room - things like a bathroom where more stalls means more throughput, or adding beds to a trauma ward. In TPC, while you might be able to get away with a min-size room for your first year or two, you'll all but need to make those rooms bigger to accommodate those extra required objects. Which is great! It helps to add a lot of variety to your campuses, since I found that I was often upgrading my existing rooms instead of making a one-size fits all template and plopping that down to replace the original. Upgrading rooms is helped a lot by the new addition of being able to build your own buildings and resize your existing ones, too - though I would argue that, although it's undeniably super convenient, it's also kind of overpowered, since it completely short-circuits one of the fun parts of TPH's room layouts, which was puzzling out how to lay out your rooms. In TPC, you never need to, since you can just knock down a wall to fit a new extra meters of classroom. TPC also brought back the Prestige system from TPH, where rooms gain levels based on how much stuff is in them. Arguably, it's even more important now - higher prestige rooms make students happier and learn better, which is why it's a shame that it's such a pain in the ass now. TPH had a degenerate strategy whereby you could just spam hundreds of a single small, high-prestige item to pump up your prestige rating. TPC addresses this by... adding severe diminishing returns on items you add multiples of. Which is smart, at first, but realistically that means to hit the high level requirements students often want, you'll be plastering the walls of your rooms with dozens of different posters, which is a complete thematic miss and is also a usability disaster, to boot.

There are plenty of other changes, too; some better, some worse. Training doesn't have you flying in experts, or having your staff teach a class of your colleagues anymore - they just sit in a training pod until they level up. Worse, each staff member has three skill slots, each of which have ten levels - AND skills no longer increase just from being used! In TPH, your doctors would improve as they worked; in TPC, your staff is just as good as they were the day you hired them if you don't train them. Classes are not super well balanced - I often found myself taking the same 2-3 courses in levels, since they had high tuition fees, relatively small rooms, and brought in students that had helpful passive abilities. And this is never told to you in-game, but some classes can actively cause problems for you in the form of campus invasions (TPC's equivalent of TPH's ghosts, whereby your janitors need a special skill in order to remove the ruffians before they cause too much chaos) or other maluses. The campaign has some good variety, and unlike TPH I felt like the 3 star requirements didn't really outstay their welcome, with the worst goals usually just being 'graduate so many students with this grade or better,' which isn't really too burdensome if you've been running a good campus. There are a few levels with gimmicks, sort of like Duckworth-upon-Bilge in TPH, and while most people didn't like DuB's gimmick, I really liked it, as I also do the gimmicks in TPC.

There's also some DLC, which I didn't play, just like how I didn't play the DLC for TPH. Maybe if it goes on sale, I'll pick it up.

Overall, Two Point Campus is a great improvement to the formula that Two Point Hospital pioneered. It took me about fifty hours overall to 100% the base game, which is coincidentally almost exactly as long as it took me to 100% Two Point Hospital too. If you're looking for an excellently-made sim game, or an evolution on the fun-but-flawed TPH formula, Two Point Campus is a great choice.

Steam has become mired beneath a cadre of self-entitled kids that ""thumbs down"" any game that a) isn't free, b) isn't perfect (even if early access), and/or c) isn't the game they ~mistakenly~ thought it would be. For objective evaluation, read the positive reviews first; if you still have doubts, then check out the negative ones - just understand you can safely ignore most of them. I recommend this practice for all games here.

* Caveat: My hours played is misleading. I often leave games running overnight. Probably total hours actually in-game is around 50 to 60, much of that spent ""letting time pass"" to complete objectives that basically require the passage of time...

--------------------

The game is described above, and the screenshots and trailers show pretty well what is it. Not going to re-describe it. As for its comparison to Two Point Hospital: Same graphics, same general style, but without the sense of urgency (or challenge, if I'm honest) and with the bonus of being able to completely redesign (or remove) buildings. It has a much more casual feel, and while the graphics and animations are still comical, they're not as humourous as the hospital version.

It's ... a more scaled-back, mindless experience, but still a nice time-passing colony-building style sim to run in the background. I've enjoyed it enough to have purchased both DLCs, and the entertainment value by dollar-per-hour is just fine for me. Whether or not you played TPH, I recommend it - but with the cautionary note that you must have some patience to suffer through some issues (mainly UI related) and a couple of very annoying bugs that have been present since launch. I will address these below.

--------------------

* You cannot rotate the camera freely vertically and horizontally at the same time. It's just weird to get used to.

* Like TPH, most of your actions are spamming posters, pictures, windows, decoration and entertainment items in rooms and hallways (and outside). This is much more tedious now with the ability to completely redesign buildings - even with saving room templates (which I've never found useful), the items on the outside walls are still lost when moving them. It's a serious chore, moreso than in TPH.

* The UI is also still a clunky click-fest.
	+ Open message box, select a message that requires you to place an item for a student request; click to place it and... the message box is closed. You have to re-open it every time
	+ Placing items? Item window is open, scroll down to the item, place it but oops, wrong spot - to grab item to move it and... the item window is close. Re-open, scroll back down...
	+ Open staff window to see who's on break or available for training. Click staff member, select training and it swaps to the training list window. Which you then have to close, to re-open the staff window to get back to seeing who's next on break...
	+ Really need 'feeder' or 'top-level' UI/UX elements to stay open until you manually close them.

* For staff training, they do not default to using the highest-upgraded training pods or even the closest. Often they'll head to training after a class, barely get started, then leave to run back to the next class. It can take ages, so you need to find staff on break (see above note) OR micro-managed the training stations and disable job assignments to ensure training takes priority. Very tedious.

* More unnecessary clicking - a never-ending series of demands each academic year for parties, DJs, movie nights... It doesn't matter how happy or entertained the students are, a dozen times per year you will click on the student demand, click on schedule, click on 'create' and (then re-open the message window)... It feels like an artificial attempt to increase the sense of challenge or activity but results in just more mindlessly unnecessary clicking.

* Staff hiring is an exercise in extreme patience. You get offered a new staff member about once a minute, up to a maximum ""on hold"" based on campus prestige. You will want to hire during summer break, when time isn't passing and you're free to let the game run for... hours, it can take, to get the staff members you need with just the right skills, the right traits, and no negative traits. There are no good reasons to hire any else than ~exacty~ what you want, so either the training labs need a way to 'wipe' skills and traits, or you'll want to use a trainer to instantly refill the staff queue.

* Some rooms have giant machinery, and the 'hitbox' is so large that you can't redecorate the room (like move a picture to make room for a window) because the cursor only targets the machinery. If the is too small to move the machinery you must either sell it (which means re-upgrading a replacement) or forget the redecoration. This is also true with doors - try to resize a room but the door is blocked? Have to micro-the new size while moving the door bit by bit until you get what you want.

* Students & staff occasional get 'stuck' with pathing issues - not moving at all. Students will stand there until their health, hunger, and all other stats are 0 and they've failed out of the courses. Staff will get stuck in weird travel loops, like walking around the outside edges of the map to get to a piece of litter in the middle, then back to outside edges to get back to the building. These patching/stuck issues have been present since launch.

* No dedicated save slots, so you can't re-load to an earlier point on a campus if the staff get stuck after you've moved some rooms around, for instance. Another reason to wait until summer-break to do your remodeling...

* Assign clothing style to staff type - like white coats for teachers - and ""apply to all staff of this type"". But it doesn't remember that once you've loaded an existing game. And keeping your staff (teachers, assistants, janitors) clothed in recognizable ways is pretty useful, if not necessary.

* Unused but unlocked plots are treated as 'active' by the staff. Janitors need to go outside to pick weeks, clear falling frogs, all sorts of 'disasters' that require cleaning. Big problem is that if you unlock plots but aren't using them yet, janitors will travel all the way across the map to pick one weed... Ditto for 'looking for work' - staff will wander around aimlessly, and often end up all the way across the map, making them late for jobs that do suddenly require their attention. Unused plots should be 'excluded' from debris & 'wander' events. 

--------------------

These issues and bugs aside, nothing game-breaking, the game is playable and enjoyable. But it requires no small amount of patience to work through these issues/bugs and have fun with the 'meat' of the experience. As mentioned, running in the background and playing casually while waiting in a dungeon queue in an MMO or catching up on laundry worked for me. It just doesn't have that ""one more turn"" sense of captivation I felt with TPH, with-or-without the UI/UX issues and odd bugs.

I hit 3-star objectives on every campus and did get my entertainment value per dollar out of it, so it would juvenile not to give it a thumbs-up. But take this recommendation with a grain of salt: A casual building/logistics sim that mostly plays itself, where you involvement consists of occasionally pausing, click-spamming while expanding and redesigning rooms/buildings, then un-pausing and letting it play itself again.",1679916782,1679916782,True,7,1,0.484363645315170288,0,True,False,False

I really like how I need to figure out the best way to do things without feeling like I'm on the edge of catastrophic failure the whole time. The large variety of interesting locations was such a treat and that includes the DLC in space which I also purchased. There is enough management to make it interesting but not so much micro management that I feel like i'm at work. I do sometimes like more complex management games but I don't think its necessary for every game to add more and more of those features. Sometimes it's just fun doing a little management and having fun design elements and cute characters to watch as they go about their lives. If you're looking for a micromanagement game with a lot of depth to the operation of the scenarios this game may not satisfy as well as some others, but if you like management games with a little challenge, a bit more relaxed without a timer, a bit of design, and lots of cute funny characters and hilarious two point radio announcers chatting in the background then i feel confident recommending this game. 

My computer isn't the best but the game still runs pretty well. I have experienced some infrequent crashes but it's not often enough to be annoying to me.  I have very few critiques and they mainly are about the UI needing to be more organized and less clunky to get around, it is the one area of the game that does frustrate me to a small extent, it seems outdated and not as easy or intuitive as it should be. I find that i have to switch back and forth in the menu a lot when I'm looking at the skills of my employees and then choosing to send them to training. I want to be able to see the individual details about the staff and send them to training without the game then sending me to the training tab when I want to stay in the general employee info tab for instance. It's a lot of clicking back and forth at times when you're wanting to mass train staff. Additionally I don't think the janitors are without their issues. At one large university i had a dorm located at the top and the bottom of my campus and the bottom dorm always had dirty beds no matter how many janitors i hired and assigned to cleaning. i would then tag the beds for cleaning and they still didn't show up. So i had to resort to continually picking up janitors and dropping them on that task over and over. It would be really nice if you could assign janitors to specific buildings and areas. The teachers are really good at doing their assigned jobs so that doesn't need any changes and the students mostly do what they need to without too much supervision as long as they have the facilities required to keep them happy. 

Overall I do recommend this game because it is a lot of fun and low stress. The campuses are diverse looking and attractive, the different classes are so fun to unlock and incorporate and many of the campuses are large enough to allow you the opportunity to have a lot more going on if you want and also from a design aspect I really enjoyed having more area to make my campuses not just functional but also pretty.  I can't wait for more additional content, particularly a larger variety of things like basic wallpaper and flooring choices and decorative items and recolors, because that's one of my favorite aspects of the game.",1677437604,1677437604,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's confusing to figure out how many students you have in each course and how many are coming in. I never have enough janitors and my food/drink kiosks are constantly unmanned for some reason.

The best features of this game is the ever changing and growing campus and events as you try to achieve and finish all the goals to making your school prosperous and functional.

Is it just Two Point Hospital again? Kinda. I also own Two Point Hospital and it feels like a bit of a smoother experience. It isn't exactly like they re-skinned the former into this, but it's very much one of a very defined series with defined systems. Are the differences enough to warrant dropping $40 (or 30, in my case) on this game? Depends. It's fun. I like it. It definitely is not the most CHALLENGING management sim in the world, but it's certainly got enough hooks and niches to keep you invested (maxing the stars of each college, the challenges, the subtle increase in difficulty/mechanics with each school, etc). The pageantry of it all is also a delight; what it lacks in difficulty it makes up for in character. The Two Point series is very much made for people who loved Wallace and Gromit as children, or think it's funny to riff on rural England (very valid). 

So...buy it? Yes. In my opinion it's fun moderate difficultly management sim that's more for relaxation than anything.

Two Point Campus is one of those games where you always think to yourself that you like simulation management games, but aren't any good at it. After half an hour, those worries will be a distant memory!

There is always a TON of things to do in the game, whether it be handling your constantly updating mail box which has your monthly income statement, inspections that earn you money and Kudosh (the special currency used to unlock stuff), any incoming inclement weather, and requests from your students for items for their happiness/personal quests.

TPC has absolutely NAILED Quality of Life. Not strapped for cash anymore and want to expand your rooms? Easy and quick. Want to rotate the room? Check. Want to move the room to an entirely new building across campus to better organize your buildings? Check. Do you have a perfect design for a room? Make it into a template. Are you placing decorations to increase relationships indoors and need to switch quickly to outdoors? There's a button for that.

TPC is bright, with wonderful graphics and humor with an easy & fun learning curve that slowly adds new mechanics that make sense. The AI and pathing isn't half bad either!

TPC has 3 game modes: 
1) a campaign mode where you have a specific objective (e.g. modernizing the courses of a campus), and by unlocking the first star of challenges, you'll unlock a new campus and each subsequent star beyond the first, will unlock new things (courses, items and events) that you can use in the existing game or any other game you jump into.
2) sandbox with various difficulty settings, with the ability to pick the campus.
3) challenge mode with specific requirements to earn the most points (e.g. 2023 Valentine's day event is to make as many people fall in love as possible within a certain time limit. Periodically, you can set of love bombs in specific areas to increase people's relationships with each other)

I thought this was a great opportunity to fix the management issues of Two Point Hospital. However, I was disappointed to find that Two Point Campus feels like I'm not managing anything at all. Instead of fixing issues, trying to raise revenue, and improving your stats (which are the things people enjoy about games like TPH), the game is more like a ""build your rooms and wait for half an hour to end the round"" type of game. Sure, you can do things while the year is running, but they don't seem to have much of an effect on the outcome. The whole point of this type of game is that it's supposed to be challenging. I remember the first 10-20 hours of TPH, where I was barely keeping the hospitals afloat, but this game is not challenging at all. The amount of money they give you at the start covers everything, and each level of the campus feels repetitive.

Overall, I am disappointed with Two Point Campus. As a fan of Two Point Hospital, I was hoping for an experience that was just as challenging and engaging.

I liked it until I reached one of the later universities where you open your first Archeology classes. I ran into multiple problems that made me lose all interest in the game. 

- There is a hard cap for students you can have on the campus that the game won't tell you about. 300 students is the maximum capacity you can have in any campus during any year. Not only that, there appears to be a soft cap starting at 180 students already as I experienced that yesterday ingame. I just got to year 5 and bought the third plot of land until I noticed the game wouldn't let me add more students due to ""capacity issues"". What am I supposed to do with the other 4 land plots and upgrading my courses??? If your staff gets leveled up enough, you can't reach positive numbers anymore due to the hard cap on student numbers. That alone completely destroyed my drive to continue playing because there is no point to make a bigger and better campus. 

- You get spammed by pop ups eventually that you can't disable. Not at all, not certain kinds of them. 

- The Marketing Office is pointless because all it does is attract more applicants that you can't even accept anymore due to the students cap later in the game. You can't attract specific or higher educated staff which was great in Two Point Hospital. 

- Many aspects of the game aren't even mentioned ingame, I just figured things out from playing TPH before.

I'll deinstall Two Point Campus today and get back to Two Point Hospital if I feel the itch again, overall a way better game.",1676568351,1676568351,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Recently finally tried out Two Point Hospital, loved it because it was essentially the new and improved, albeit buggy, Theme Hospital from my childhood. Made a status about it and an acquaintance recommended this, which I had already added to my wishlist quickly after playing TP Hospital. Got this 30% on sale. 

Here's the thing, I love this game because it's more Two Point feels with totally different systems and it's very engaging and fun. They added some really interesting ideas like being able to design building shapes. They made some really clever and intuitive upgrades from TPH gameplay into this.... However this is a double edge sword and imho a place where it stumbles. Due to some of the upgraded options to you as the manager, some of these upgrades I feel makes the UI streets behind where TPH was. The amount of times I haven't been able to place an object I really should be able to place and then having to pull and push the object around weirdly just to put it in the exact same position I was already in but this time allowed to place the thing. However, I have a tendency to really clutter my spaces and max out room levels while minimizing the space needed to do that, leaving very very tight spaces, in TPH this just made the pawns jumble while going about and kind of making traffic jams everywhere with folks animations going through each other... which I found entirely endearing. However with TPC, these jams seem to really obstruct some of the things, saw a couple of pawns get stuck in months long glitches of getting stuck in a table or something trying to get to a food place. It's way less endearing this time around with the UI wonkiness being compounded into all of it. This being said, if you have patience, loved TPH, and maaaayyybe consider spreading out a bit, this game is a lovely time, so far, tbh my time is skewed due to leaving the game on while I slept last night.",1676043300,1676043300,True,7,1,0.602613329887390137,0,True,False,False

Basically stopped at lower levels as I got bored as hell and it wasn't improving.  It's not like the many others over the years where you have to constantly react and ""build up"" to meet challenges.  You get a grace period between years to do most of your major work and basically sit on your tush after that.

If you played hospital, it's basically the same theme with some improvements.  Some of those improvements are for the better, some make you wonder what was going through the devs mind when they implemented it.  You can reach higher levels on both workers and ""class levels,"" but they raised it to the point that it basically doesn't make sense. All you're doing is cutting and pasting the same rooms over and over especially with their ""dimishing returns"" where the classes basically handles 50% less.  And that takes up a lot of room.  And unless they have major league sized maps on the end, you're just basically following the same theme for one type of class throughout your building or you're doing low levels trying to create a mix of classes to make the game more interesting...  It's as far away from hospital as you can get where you try to make enough money to max out personnel and equipment/rooms/treatment.  I actually fell asleep playing a couple times which is not regular for me  so about 3-4 hours you can deduct from gameplay time...  Personnel is basically the same way, you got far higher levels you can reach, but you'll quickly end up bankrupt if you try to push the max  as your income is limited to students tuition and ""bonus""
  (more on this later.)

Buildings, you can actually build your own.  No real challenge in that anymore except the issue of class level and what you're trying to accomplish.  Pathing seems to have taken a hit in this game where you end up having students bouncing back and forth in front of classroom doors and you don't have the ability to pick them up to break the cycle.  So they'll keep bouncing until things get screwed up like missing class or they graduate.  It isn't common, but it isn't rare either.  I've had at least 2 incidents per game/replay and I end up just saving game and reloading last save.  Puts them back on track...  Harder to ignore is the janitors becoming stupider then before.  I tried to post on the Steam discussion forums, but it got deleted.  Not because it was a rant or used foul language, but because they want people to create an account and post it on their website.  Usually, I wouldn't have any issue with that, but I have too many games and I'm not going to create an account for every one of them where I have an issue.  You sold on Steam, it's a common site for both consumer and devs, then make use of it...  I posted to a drop box with video's showing the issues with the computer losing track of people and erroring as well as the DX error log, and it got deleted within 6 hours.  I contacted Steam with a copy of what I posted and they said there was nothing wrong to get deleted by them, and they said they have no log of deleting it themselves.  As the devs have access, they had to have done it (according to Steam so don't bite my head off as I'm going off of what I was told.)  One video was showing the ricochet rabbit action of one of the students, the other videos showed full energy/happiness janitors walking up to the room and turning around and going elsewhere allowing the room to become trashed and nothing getting fixed.  Had the error logs for the specific video as well.  Oh well, not going to worry about it as the game as it stands right now isn't going to be started much.

You supposedly get more ""students"" then you got ""patients"" in hospital.  It sounds good until you think it through.  In hospital, you had 200 patients cycling through when you push for that level of care/gameplay.  You get around 300 students one shot at the beginning of the year according to posts I've read making it seem like it can handle more when you build up to that level.  But, due to how the gameplay is, it feels like you're dealing with far less.  And with the dimishing return issue that I really can't see a point to (it may be somewhat realistic, but it's annoying as the game isn't a ""realism"" game,) it basically just eats up space with no real point having to create a bunch of unneeded classrooms that sit empty most of the time at the level I got bored with and exited out.    If they allow scheduling classrooms/classes at far higher levels, just disregard this section as I allowed my boredom to get the better of me before I reached a more challenging stage that allows you to maximize usage.

Heating/cooling is basically the same as hospital meaning it can be more of an annoyance then a help at times.  They fixed the gold certificate spam on university (good!!!!!!) so you can't just spam one item to get your room ratings up.  I regularly took every room up to 14 except the bathroom and the shower room even without the ability to spam.  Trying to get to 15 looks like it would be a bear to reach, but I didn't finish the game so I don't know what other things ""pop up"" later in the game to add for decorations that may make it easier..

In order to offset the continual income made in hospital, they basically pay you the tuition to you monthly as well as a bonus from students improving or liking space they're in.  It levels up the university and can bring in funding as well.  I can see why they did it with the limitations as you only have the same ""customers"" for the entire year, but it can be an annoyance especially if you're not throwing parties or bringing in live bands for them to give them an extra ""boost"" and shake the purse some more.

Like I said, I just can't get into it as my playstyle is for more ""interaction"" then this game has.  If I comment on a game, I usually have hundreds of hours into it before I comment on it.  But, maybe I'll jump into it at a later time and have a different opinion and give it another chance as I've still got about 8 games and DLC's for games I already own I purchased at the same time as this  that I haven't played yet.  I don't like to leave a game unfinished...

This is the follow up to Two Point Hospital, and Campus includes many of the same gameplay features, so if you’ve played Hospital, Campus will feel familiar.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

•	Train chefs, knights, clowns, wizards, spies, sports stars, and more, using various course specific teaching rooms, as well as the lecture theatre, library and private tuition room.

•	Look after student and staff basic needs with a dormitory, toilets, showers, staff room, student lounge, student union, vending machines and food kiosks.

•	Some courses are dangerous, so you’ll need a medical office to treat student injuries. And you’ll need a counsellor to improve student happiness to prevent them from dropping out.

•	Entertain students with arcade machines, various social clubs, film nights and live music gigs.

•	Train staff with new and improved skills, and research upgrades for equipment to improve student grades.

•	Rival schools will send their students to damage your equipment, so you’ll need janitors trained in security to shoot them with water pistols (Campus’ equivalent of Hospital’s ghosts).

•	Campus is easier and less stressful than Two Point Hospital. The main reason for this is because of how the game is divided into academic years. At the start of each year you’ll select which courses to run, and the game will tell you exactly how many students you’ll receive, and how many teachers and rooms you’ll need. You won’t get taken by surprise by a sudden increase in demand that you’re not prepared to handle, which frequently happened in Hospital.

•	With the main infrastructure in place at the start of the academic year, during the year you’ll mostly just have to deal with minor requests from students, such as buying equipment they need to complete assignments, setting up new entertainment options, or adding decorative items.

•	Finances are quite easy to manage too. You’ll probably need loans to buy everything when first starting each university, but the default tuition fees are so high that by year 3 I was usually making plenty of profit to pay back those loans and fund further expansion.

•	There are 12 maps which focus on a different main subject, and you can earn up to a 3 star rating on each by achieving specific objectives. Some objectives relate to students passing courses with high grades, others focus on student/staff happiness, entertainment, hunger, etc. The most tedious objectives will be familiar to Hospital players, relating to attractiveness rating, which forces you to literally cover the walls with paintings and posters, floors with rugs, and spam trees all over the outside area (which in my opinion actually makes the campus look ugly, but it gets the objective ticked off).

•	You’ll only receive students for alternate subjects if you choose to add them, so you can make each university feel unique, which helps to reduce the game’s repetitiveness. (This was my biggest complaint about Hospital – every map was basically the same, because over time you’d gradually receive patients for every illness, so you’d end up having to build every treatment room on every map).

•	However, one thing that is extremely repetitive is Campus’ radio DJ dialogue. Especially if you want to 3 star each map, you will hear the same stories and bad jokes over and over and over again.

[h1]Technical[/h1]

•	It took me 68 hours to complete all maps with a 3 star rating.

•	The longer I played some maps, my framerate started to dip into the 40’s and even occasionally the 30’s. Changing graphics settings didn’t have any impact at all (I even tried putting everything to minimum), it just seems that the more students and staff you’ve got, the performance will eventually decline. Usually at that point I’d already built most of what I needed and I’d just be waiting for the more grindy 3 star requirements to complete. And I don’t think framerate is as important here as it would be for a fast paced action game. But it still didn’t feel good to look at.

•	I didn’t experience any crashes or major gameplay bugs, but I did see a few visual bugs.

•	On multiple occasions on different maps, the bands I’d booked for student union gigs would get stuck at the side of the stage, no music would play, the students would all stand still instead of dancing, but they’d all still get the happiness bonus for attending a live gig.

•	I saw multiple cheeseball matches where all players stood still for the whole match, nobody took any shots, but at the end I’d still receive a message telling me if I won or lost and the final score.

•	I frequently saw doors to various rooms get stuck in a half open position with people clipping through, until eventually it would resume opening and closing properly.

The fine folks behind [i]Two Point Hospital[/i] have turned their attention from hospitals to colleges.  Many gameplay elements and references from that game have made it into [i]Two Point Campus.[/i]

The game sets you in the position of a dean of a series of colleges and universities.  You will build buildings and rooms, agree to run various courses, hire staff, and see that students are taken care of, with an occasional minor crisis thrown in.

There's not much more micromanagement than that.  You don't have to schedule classes, staff, or students, as the game sorts that out for you.


The 3D room editor is much the same as it was in TPH.  You can freely copy and even move entire rooms as well as items, and create templates for rooms.  You can also customize the floors and walls.

In a welcome enhancement from TPH, the room editor is extended to the campus buildings themselves, allowing you to move beyond the building footprints they offer you.

Just be sure to leave some outside land.  Some items are meant to be outside, and some classroom areas, such as a jousting arena or a sports field, must be placed outdoors.


As for courses, they and their packages of classes are all set up for you.  All you have to do is to choose which courses to run, upgrade them, and make sure you have enough classrooms for them.  The game warns you if you don't have enough rooms or teachers for a course.

Classrooms include both a lecture hall and various labs for more practical experience.  Outside of class, students have homework and will need stations in the labs or a library to complete it.  The library has several specialized bookcases full of tomes appropriate to each course.

Some lab rooms can be used for more than one course.  The culinary school needs kitchens, but also a Science Lab for food science work.


Students will need accommodations including a dorm, bathrooms, showers, and food and entertainment.  You will also have to see that medical and mental needs are attended to, and offer private tutoring.

Despite Two Point Hospital having a cafe for both staff and patients, there's no cafeteria here on Two Point Campus.  Instead, you have vending machines and food kiosks as well as the student lounge and student union.

You can hold several events in various rooms, as well as book concerts for the student union stage.

Students also have goals of finding friendships or romances, or attending a concert.  Giving them the items and events that facilitate these goals adds to student happiness, which makes them more motivated to learn.

TPC has social clubs that students can sign up for and level up in.  These give advantages to members or your campus.  The Book Club enhances learning.  The Nature Club enables its members to help you maintain the plants on campus.


Students fall into several types.  Some courses appeal to specific types, while others appeal to a range.  Each type bears a (usually beneficial) trait or two.  Class Clowns and Musicians entertain everyone.  Wizards (yes, the British devs were inspired by Hogwarts) use their powers for good or evil depending on their mood.


Your staff, too, needs to be kept happy, albeit to a lesser extent as the hospital staff in TPH.  A staff room of their own and occasional training, as well as solving the same environmental issues that annoy students, goes a long way.

Staff do multiple jobs.  Professors can teach class, do research, or tutor struggling students.  Assistants serve not just as food kiosk clerks and library assistants, but also nurses in the medical clinic and counselors in Pastoral care. Janitors clean up the place and maintain equipment and water plants, but also play security guard to bust intruders.  You can forbid staff from various aspects they are qualified for to keep them to their strengths, or train them up.


As students learn in their classes, they earn XP which, along with the value of the campus itself and the total value of the staff, earns Course Points.  These are applied at the beginning of a school year to upgrade or start new courses.


You'll have some VIP visitors, such as the education minister, a health inspector, pop star Jasmine Odessey, or actor Roderick Cushion.  Each has their own aspect that they are looking at, and will pay if they like what they see.  You also have prospective students visit and can gain a bonus student entering in the next year.

Cash can come from a couple other sources.  VIPs will give you a donation if you hit certain threshold goals that they propose.  Posh students will randomly give you a donation if they are happy enough.  And you get a bonus for the XP students earned that month.

Or, you can take out a loan.  There are three levels of loans, each with a fixed payment over a term of a couple of years.  You can't pay extra to pay it down faster, but you can pay it off in a lump sum and use one loan to pay off another.

You can also earn Kudosh, which is used to unlock new decor items and new items to complete assignments.  Students will request something that they know they'll need.  Kudosh can also be spent on extra customization options for students, staff, and decor.


Research and Marketing rooms return.  This time, research usually requires a teacher in a related subject matter.  Research unlocks new items or upgrades to equipment to make it more efficient, or projects that produce cash or Kudosh.

Marketing here can only attempt to attract new students.  There's no ""attract better staff talent"" campaign as in Two Point Hospital, but you can train the ones you have.


There are twelve levels to play in the base game.  All that's needed to ""win"" and unlock more campuses is to score a single star by reaching certain objectives.  The objectives are pretty straightforward and listed in a sidebar.  You can continue on a campus to reach three stars, or return later.

Later levels have some interesting challenges, such as finding funding from sources other than tuition, but these are fairly easy to figure out.  There are no time limits, so you can wait and save up.

And you WILL be waiting.  The rhythm of the school year is both a blessing and a curse.  On the plus side, the summer break makes a great time for construction, especially to move facilities around.

On the other hand, some objectives look for quality graduates or take multiple years to reach.  Fortunately, there's a double-time speed that helps.


Two Point Radio returns!  The soundtrack takes the form of a radio station, complete with amusing DJs and commercials in between the instrumentals of various flavors.  Sir Nigel, Harrison Wolff, and Ricky Hawthorne are now joined by a mostly-competent Campus Radio team.

There's also a dry, sarcastic PA announcer that drops hints as to what's going on.


The art style is the same as TPH, strongly resembling Aardman Animation of Wallace and Grommit fame.

A metric ton(ne) of British humo(u)r abounds in the witty radio script writing, course descriptions, and class names.


You're also given a metric ton(ne) of info, sliced and diced in all sorts of ways, with info sheets, charts, heat maps, and student/staff lists.

New is a Maintenance view, a 2D top-down view, with people reduced to icons.  Unfortunately, unless the person has some sort of urgent need, icons are all white and blur together.  I wish the room editor had a 2D view like this, as it would make placing objects a bit easier.


There's already signs of the same sort of updates that [i]Two Point Hospital[/i] had, with freebie seasonal items and DLC.


A college campus makes an easier institution to run than Two Point's hospitals.  For one thing, students won't die on you, either from medical maladies or suicidal despair.  They can and will drop out, though.  Or you can expel them.

While TPC does share a few similarities with TPH: I recognise some of the staff and student/patient names, the same graphic rendering, similar funny animations, TPC also goes beyond that to be more expansive in the way the game is played. There is a new choice to build your own campus from the ground up, not just placing rooms into pre-built structures. If you don't like the base structure the devs have included, you can demolish it and build a better shape, or size of base structure that you like. 

As you play further through the 12 levels/campuses, you also have the option of including more or less courses that you have unlocked. This means that you can make unique universities each time you decide to replay any particular one. A Sandbox mode has been included too so there is a lot of replayability while you build your best campus ever. 

I've not had issues with stability, no crashing, but the pawns sometimes have a few pathing issues. They do tend to cluster up in doorways, and often walk into each other, getting stuck or pushing each other along. Once or twice, characters have just gotten stuck in a random place and just won't move again. It's not game breaking though, and a quick fix for this is to hit 'Quick Save' and then reload the game. The stuck student will then resume as normal.  

Some of the radio broadcasts are just not funny, unfortunately. The 'student' broadcasts by Felicity Bellbottoms are a bit cringey, just not hitting the right note. But, Sir Nigel, Ricky and Harrison Wolff are on top form, as ever. 

It's definitely worth a go, and you'll have plenty of fun with the constructing as well as the exterior decoration function. The themes are also well thought out and you won't lack for entertainment. One caveat I will mention is not to allow in too many students too early on, as it can get frenetic and cause problems with students not getting enough assistance in their learning, resulting in more fails or drop-outs. 
Despite the two minor pathing drawbacks I have mentioned, I am really enjoying it. :}

I am 69.

My ex-husband and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The man I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Original: After 6 hours of play and getting three stars on the first two campuses, I guess my overall feel is a little disappointment.  I didn't feel any of this in Two Point Hospital, but it may not be a fair comparison to make since I went into TPH completely new and now with TPC I have some of the concepts already down pat and there aren't that many new ones.

So, it feels a bit tedious already.  The main issue is that the campus runs a year at a time, just like a school would.  During that year you might have some things you can do/handle/upgrade but many times you end up just fast forwarding through the entire year because the objective you need to accomplish isn't possible that year.  That's a big design flaw in my opinion.

TPH had a lot more charm as well.  TPC feels like it wants to be different and is hanging out with the emo kids and playing guitar.  I actually love the music, but it's not charming.  The art style didn't get super updated, but it's not really charming anymore either.  Things got less rounded but without any added realism so it just feels a little bit identity-less.  It's still the identity of TPH, except now it doesn't really fit well within itself.

I will continue to play and will change the review if necessary, but if you've never played either title I would completely recommend you play Hospital instead of Campus.",1660632928,1671464460,False,2,0,0.481590569019317627,0,True,False,False

The fact that you get an indefinite summer break before each academic year is a nice change from
Two Point Hospital, where you would get a constant flow of patients right from the start.

Staff training is also much better now in my opinion. Unlike Two Point Hospital, campus employees use a training machine (which eliminates the need to constantly hire/assign trainers) and they do it automatically in their own free time, so it doesn't disrupt your operations. Also, instead of having to wait for staff to be promoted to unlock another training slot, staff can now be trained anytime. All of this makes training much less frustrating than TPH's system.

The base game has 12 different levels/universities, which you gradually unlock. Each university usually
introduces a new game mechanic, except for the last level, which gives you a large plot of land to
create your own university using knowledge from the previous levels. Although some levels were 
slightly annoying, the overall variety was quite nice and I personally found it fun to get 3 stars on every university. The game also has a sandbox mode, where you can choose any map you want and customise its rules to your liking.

Building has also been improved. Instead of having to fit rooms into prebuilt layouts, you can now construct buildings in any shape you want. The exterior can also be decorated with paths, plants and outdoor furniture. You can also customize wallpapers and floors like in Two Point Hospital. However, newly built rooms always have the default wallpaper and floor, meaning you have to change it everytime you expand your campus. I got used to it, but it is a bit annoying.

The overall feel is similar to Two Point Hospital. The visuals are pretty much identical, and the in-game world is as humorous as before. Ricky Hawthorn, Harrison Wolff and Nigel B are back on the radio along with newcomers, who offer commentary on university life in Two Point County. The soundtrack is quite nice, but I personally find a bit inferior to Two Point Hospital's OST. It is still pleasant, but it feels less varied.

If you enjoyed building hospitals in the previous game, then you will probably have fun creating universities in Two Point Campus. Just keep in mind that it is less challenging and more relaxed, which might put some people off.",1669738076,1669738076,True,103,0,0.906061828136444092,1,True,False,False

Less control/understanding and more ""Well it just happens that way"". 

Feeling like a failure because the game keeps giving you students who hate studying/doing their work and so they fail, even if you send them to a tutor (which is expensive and ends up being half the damn campus).

No way to control who goes to what club. The clubs feel cool and honestly, we should get to decide what students do. They're, in essence, staff that we didn't have to hire and they're persistent in the campus. It's not like they change from year to year.

I was seriously so excited for this game to release. Then I played it and didn't realize I had to sign up on the twopointcounty website just to get the golden toilet (was not this way for Two Point Hospital).

I can see what they were going for here, truly, and that my friends, is variety. But it actually ended up hurting it in the end.
The continuity problem is glaring, presenting the ""illusion"" of choice. Campuses have finite building spaces, thus creating the challenges. BUT the game says, for example ""Like the Knight school? Getting bored of the Archeology level? Don't worry! Just introduce it into the levels curriculum!"" which you absolutely can't do if you hope to win.
Humour wasn't as good as T.P Hospital (a bit dry).
Game balancing has shifted dramatically from T.P Hospital (not for the better)
In hindsight, I think I'm only recommending this title out of respect for T.P Hospital. It's fun for awhile, but it quickly loses focus after 5-6 levels of gameplay. Doesn't keep you coming back like T.P Hospital.

However, be aware that as of November '22 the otherwise joyful experience is marred by two highly annoying problems, pathfinding and bugs. 

Pathfinding is hair-raising. Janitors pick a single target, regardless where on the campus it is. Starting with the third building this gets painfully counterproductive, whether it is trash or intruders. Students do not wait ten seconds to be next in line using anything whatsoever. They will walk one-and-a-half in-game months for some drink of water. This hurts worst with any staffed office (especially medical), since depending on priority interruptions the latter can be blocked for months. That makes ""strategic"" spread of services deadly.

As for bugs, there are no game-breaking ones, but the bad ones come close enough. Top of the Pops are hijacking and glitching. The first is, when students of the wrong course hijack a lecture theater, they are not even allowed to use. That creates 5 to 8 F's, which depending on your courses can mean having to restart the map. The second is both students and staff glitching through walls into building areas, which do not have an exit. If the glitched is a student, it may take half a school year before being able to rebuild the room one has to scrap (since new stragglers walk into the now open space). Why the program doesn't do a safety check for instance once a month is beyond me.

How do I determine what teachers teach which classes? Turns out, you don't have much input over things like that; the system pretty much just runs automatically. This sets the tone for the game as a whole.

On the aesthetic side of things, there are so few amusing animations. In TPH, pretty much every room had a unique, comedic animation, and part of the fun of progressing through the game was getting to see more of them. Despite the potential in the classes, TPC has almost nothing like those.

If you had fun with the hospitals, you will definitely have fun here.

Coming from the previous game I felt like some things were stripped down as you had more options before (example: you can’t choose the pricing for the drinks or food here) and some things like staff satisfaction or happiness didn’t have any effect on my game while those had an effect in the hospital and some tasks or goals (looking at the hygiene mostly). It is a shorter game as most of the goals are a lot easier while the game is simpler to grasp and there is a sure way to “win” every campus. Get the exact number of teachers game tells you to get, get 1-2 assistants for the first couple of years and 1-2 janitors. Build all the general buildings and increase the dormitory as high as you can as the years progress. Once the money starts rolling in that’s it, you won, just need to wait while you train the people to either 2 skills to lvl 10 or 3 skills to around lvl 5 each. You will be getting more than enough money and passing grades to know what to do with.
I had leftover lots and space to build things I didn’t really need to finish up the level and you start to randomly build things to get the points to increase the educational level so you can get more students.
At the end I had to try to get people to drop out for that one achievement as nobody dropped out during my regular play.

All in all the game is not balanced correctly to pose a challenge but that’s fine as it’s the same fun as the previous one albeit with less and faster stages.
Keep in mind that I finished it here and platinumed on a PS5 while still playing and gathering trophies on a PS4 version so yeah, fun.

Performance:
Oh man, crashes on both systems (PC and PS5 with the PS4 version crashing the most).
I was hoping that coming from the Hospital they would figure out a way to offload more workload to other CPU threads but no, it’s the same as there. As the campus gets bigger, the FPS gets lower. On a 3080 and 5800X with game on 1440p it dips to middle 20ties with GPU nod passing 70% and CPU hanging around 20-30%. This was the issue with the Hospital as well. The most FPS stable is the PS4 version running at a lower resolution (clearly visible) on a PS5 but there are those crushes I mentioned so, again, not great.

Again, it’s a fun game but with the issues above. Looking forward to any expansions but there are those things keeping it from being great.",1666879379,1666879379,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Quite a few of the three star (out of three stars) missions for a level where simply time grinds.

When Two Point Campus was announced I was cautiously optimist, what's not to like about the developers behind the amazing Two Point Hospital trying something new? And for the most part, I was pleasantly surprised. The game uses the same style as TPH but the mechanics behind the scenes are very different. I've seen some people calling this a ""reskin"" and I really think that is unfair, sure similar items exist (like vending machines, radiators, bins etc) but the way the campus operates is very different to a hospital,

One of the biggest changes from hospital is the ability to customise the shape/size/number of buildings and alter the outside of buildings. For me, this is a bit of a double edged sword,  the customisation addition is nice, I quite enjoyed designing around the buildings, but I do think the ability to change size/shape/number makes the game too easy. I always felt that hospital deliberately set buildings up like a jigsaw to make things more challenging, here you can just change everything to suit yourself (something I'm sure some fans prefer).

Then we have the mechanics, personally I feel this is where Campus falls down. I'm not a fan of the yearly cycle, essentially the game plays out a year, then pauses for you to setup for the next. You can find yourself simply waiting for the year to play out, or wanting to customise lessons only to find you can only do this between sessions. It also forces you to spend money on additional rooms/staff that you might not necessarily want and subsequently needing a loan. I understand why this has been implemented but don't think it works as well as traditional sims that continue indefinitely. 

Whilst I'm talking about mechanics I'm still baffled as to how training and need meeting works. Unlike hospital when staff can simply stop what they're doing to train or take a break, staff (and students) seem to prioritise classes above anything else and can end up in bad shape. I've also found it nearly impossible to train teachers as they're always busy doing something else. For me, the obvious answer to this was to train/rest between years but it's almost as if everyone goes into standby and nothing much happens. Also, for some odd reason the developers have decided to change training for a  traditional room (like hospital), to a machine that can only train 1 person at a time. That's not to say things don't work, they do, just not as well as TPH - and I must add that staff skills are implemented much better than hospital (if you can get them trained)

So to sum it up, good sim with some unique mechanics  (but a little too easy) and outshined in my opinion by it's predecessor. It might not sound like it but I have enjoyed my time with the game and look forward to seeing what changes are implemented as time goes on.

I enjoyed Two Point Hospital a lot and spent 230 hours playing, so I was looking forward to Two Point Campus. 
TPC provides no challenge, you don’t have to thoughtfully plan your campus - just build whatever and wait till the end of the school year to pass a level. Whereas in TPH you had to count each step your doctors take, plan training for the employees and oftentimes restart levels to do everything right. 
TPC mechanics seem a little underdeveloped - I could pass levels without adding more courses and the whole training logic was very annoying - only one member of staff could be trained at once. Want to pass the monthly revenue task? Just fire everyone and wait till the end of the month. Reach attractiveness or happiness level? Just wait for the year to end. No strategy needed.

In two point hospital I had fun to decide how to build the hospital to ""process"" the patients in the most effective way, get them healed and out of the hospital, or just thrown out :-). Here the classes have just set prerequisites the game forces you to fulfill, then you just build some support rooms, and a ton of cosmetic stuff. And you just wait the whole year while everybody sticks around, getting prompts what students or employees want to build. And thats kinda it, rinse and repeat, just build different rooms for different classes on each campus, where only a few classes share some type of rooms so they supplement each other. 

Quite a big difference from the hospital where everything was just adding on top of each other, so you ended up having to decide what to build and what not, risking you build the wrong thing. Here its just like choosing in the start of the year that this year i will be getting only psychiatry patients. Next year, i will choose if i want more of the same patients, or i will add some patients that need pharmacy. And the game will always tell me what amount of rooms and staff I need for them, and even wont let me start the year without fulfilling these. So from the management point of view, the game actually plays itself.

The biggest positive for me is that it made me to install Two point hospital again, and I am having great fun with that again, not playing this one anymore.",1663450528,1663450528,False,4,0,0.54892432689666748,0,True,False,False

The most annoying one is the fact that the training screen doesn't actually show who's requesting training.  It seems odd as it would have been super easy to mark, but isn't available as a visual or in the filters.  This leads to the best way to actually see who wants training being just watching the screen until a staff training bubble pops up.  More over, when you accept a training it closes down the training menu so you have to open and scroll all the way back to where you were for each training.  The fact that these bubbles only show up one at a time, means that you might well be staring at somebody who wants training, but you have to go through some random order for them to bubble.

This game is exactly what I was expecting, and I like it a lot, but this one example shows they didn't really ever thing about players QOL while building the game.  The character filters that do exist don't actual work, or filter out any useful information.  The information overlays do a worse job than they did in TPH. Many the upgrades don't actually have a visual identification so you will be constantly clicking on things to make sure they are upgraded (looking at you Cheese-ball fields)

My only other small complaint is the almost nonsensical non-ability to actually schedule your classes.  Placing another lecture hall so that one class can be done in the entire year, even though it would make more sense to just move that one class to another month when the lecture hall is free.  One of the best parts of a management sim is the actual management, but TPC seems more like a expanded idle game.  (Not that that's bad, it just could be more.)

All this being said, I just got two starts in each level, and I had a pretty good time doing it.  Once you figure out how to work a room for maximum effectiveness it does get kinda repetitive, but I really enjoyed how the last two levels let you do your own thing.  

Just please, please fix the training issues.  It's ridiculous that as soon as a staff gets trained they typically want training again, but the only way to know who wants trained is to literally click through each employee one-by-one.  Moreover, in the stats windows, everybody who isn't currently being trained wants training but when you go through the staff you'll realize that's not true.  Basically you get knocked for the game calculating that everybody always needs training, even though you literally just trained that person.",1663444922,1663444922,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I would say it's worth the £35 price mark, though I'd need there to be some serious changes to how courses level and are added to buy expansions such as those available for 2-Point Hospital. 

I will start by saying that this game isn't particularly hard however there is a knack to it and to succeed there is some expectation of common sense while simultaneously ignoring practicality in favour of the rule that: more is more.  

My biggest gripes are that you can't cancel courses once you've locked them in. 

The good aspects of the game:
The radio is still hilarious, the music is good 
The courses and students are amusing and works well with the series expectations. 
There is a large variety of courses and freedom to choose what courses you want to offer in a given university 

The bad:
Like in 2 point Hospital beauty is as simple as plaster every surface with posters, the bigger and more items in a room the better, especially dorms. Just put 50 beds in the dorm and you're winning!

Money management is the only real challenge in the story mode of the game, and this can be either oppressive or trivial based on your preferred play-style.

Once you've chosen courses for your university there is seemingly no way to remove them and the only way to scale your university courses after a while is to increase the campus level by training every single staff member to max (exponentially increasing their salary).  

The only way to actually lose is to physically delete all the rooms, and force all students to fail by completely removing access to teachers, repeatedly. 

After 120 hours you know all the radio jokes and stories, if you don't get or like the humor you'd be sick of it. 

The exponential leveling of your campus means that it's almost impossible from a practical perspective to have a campaign university with all courses maxed out though I will keep trying on the last one and update if I do before I lose interest in the game.

TPC like TPH is certainly more about the fun than the business acumen - but some good thought has gone into developing personalities and managing individual growth and needs.

TPC is fun, quirky, colourful and with the ""story"", the music/soundtrack etc it fits together well.

Infernally, though, it pauses often and and crashes far too often.  Given the other hi res games and animation programming applications I run, this is not about machine grunt.  I think it is buggy and hope that is addressed soon as I am losing patience.

One of the best ways to up students' grades is to send them to Private Tuition.  There ought to be a way of multiple selection so that every failing student (or every C grade student etc) can be sent to PT.  As things stand, the students need to be separately identified on one graphic and then sent to PT on their individual tab elsewhere on the screen.  With a big school that takes several real-time minutes of monotonous clicking when I could be building or watching the action.

A few glitches like that really detract from the fun/enjoyment, particularly as the game gets more involved, working up the levels.  I don't need SEGA to simulate real-life boredom.  I buy these games to escape it!

Though I will say there are A LOT more item placement bugs in this game that I encountered in Two Point hospital. I have had nearly entire building be unusable because a random plant in one corner has somehow ""blocked"" placement of literally anything else.

The individual levels were all about the right level of challenge - I got three stars on each without having to restart etc, and I was all done in about 48 hours of game play going at a leisurely pace. 

However, I cannot recommend the game. It is VERY buggy, still, a month after release. Examples of bugs are:  

1. There are occasional crashes to desktop. These are mostly when copying over a room. My PC is massively over spec for this game, and I note others have had a similar issue. 

2. Pathing issues. Students get lost - I currently have one refusing to complete an assignment because the library is too far away. He is standing in a library, with the required item, an assistant present and every desk type available to him. 

3. Outside visitors have a particular issue. I first noticed this in one of the earlier levels, where an actor stood for years wondering how to get to a marketing campaign video shoot. But more annoyingly, bands who turn up to the student union quite randomly are unable to find their way to the union. At one stage I had a gaggle of 15 musicians waiting on the campus, none of whom would move (even when I put a fountain on top of them ;-)). Jasmine Odyssey turned up to one gig and just stood next to the stage, even though Shoegraze arrived immediately afterwards and played as usual. Just now, Jasmine stood actually on stage, shufflingabout and not singing. This is not what I paid her for! It is not merely cosmetic: student XP translates into earnings and they weren't getting it. 

4. The sandbox is a hot mess. I played in Challenge mode (where you have no unlocked and have to earn your special in-game currency for unlocked items, called kudosh). I got to the two star level after about 4 hours, logged off for the night, and when I logged on the next day it had lost all the items I had unlocked and all the kudosh I had squirrelled away was gone. Advice on the boards to save the game in a different slot was successful, but as the slot has to match your current career slot, you can only sandbox once. 

5. And that issue highlights what I suspect is the root of the trouble. This is a cross platform game. You have very limited save options (you will not be save scumming here) and the interface seems optimised for consoles. I paid for a PC game, and I expect it to work on a PC - and ideally to work like a PC game.

It is such a shame as I love this studio and there is a lot of lovely stuff in the game, But ultimately if bits don't work, it is a beta at best and I cannot recommend it.

With Two Point Campus, I have been playing nonstop and have experienced a consistent stream of new and fun things to unlock. Your mileage will vary depending on what you thought of TPH and *how* you like to play this kind of game.

I find the progression and challenge curves to be near perfect - Each University is unique and quirky in its own way, and the vastly different courses means a huge variety of room styles and items, letting you get really creative whilst balancing budget and efficiency. I have been able to design some really nice buildings and watch the students and staff live their charmingly expressive lives in them. Depending on my mood I switch between the campuses and work on the goals. The earlier years are more tricky because you're low on cash, and the later years are challenging due to the sheer scale and number of staff and students to accommodate and keep happy.

In my opinion, the team really ironed out some of the less satisfying elements of TPH and gave us a highly polished, fun, and zaney treat in TPC. 

It's not completely perfect; I wish my students were a little more efficient at managing their needs (eg being very unhappy due to boredom but ignoring the entertainment around them to get a drink and then idle on a table), and I would like to micro-manage my staff a tiny bit more (eg Assistants with the highest medical training should always go to work in the Medical office), but there is nothing that is more than a very minor annoyance. And I am pretty picky.

Honestly I adore the design and creativity of each University, and the unique challenges with each. This game truly scratches the creative itch as well as the micro-managing/strategy itch beautifully. It feels like the team took their time to make this right, and not just reuse stuff from TPH to quickly cash in.

It would be great if we could click on these rooms (also private tuition) and manipulate the que so we can control which students get seen first.. other than this small request it is a 5 star game and i only hope the team are looking at both DLC's and future similar games (2 point holiday resort?

I really liked several other school simulators and figured Two Point Studios would bring that genre to a level of polish that was at least playable? This has all the same pitfalls, issues, as the other school simulators and none of the benefits. 

In all school simulators, the semester cycle is brutal late game, but for this game it's so much worse since you're supposed to do multiple campuses eventually, so the problem is in every campus. Usually in school simulators you focus on one school that you're nitpicking and upgrading constantly with a lot to manage, but in this there is a little less depth for the sake of how two point likes to do their levels. 

On top of that, this has no charm and it seems a little unpolished and buggy. The UI struggles to explain the basics and is unintuitive. In TPH, there are shortcuts for selling and moving things, but there is also buttons and backup buttons so you always have some sort of option so you can get what you need to get done, done. This has none of that so I really struggled with 'ust selling items I already had? I think its like... backspace? ??? 

I think I even heard a voiceline from TPH? Maybe it was meant to be funny cameo, but I heard multiple times like 'Doctor, go back to your office!' or something like that and I was like ???? what???? 

Idk, this game was weird and not at all worth. If you have $40 to spare, buy TPH and some DLCs.",1662273191,1662273191,False,1,0,0.472964167594909668,0,True,False,False

I like that you can customize both the inside and outside, expand or shrink the campus building and it feels like it adds a lot more fun things to the game over it's predecessor.

Pros:

- Training can be chained up so that your rooms are always going.
- Higher prestige levels for your rooms so improving them on them more will have more payoff
- Classes give your students and teachers a more obvious and unique look from the others
- Levelling up classes gives the option for more students and higher teacher rankings for what they can teach

Just a fun game overall, I like the student and teachers looks.  I like that the good features of Two Point Hospital carried over, and they improved on it with their latest game based on fan feedback and experience.  I like the way you can customize the campus and building, grow or shrink it at will, that templates and copy were an option from the getgo.  I like that it starts off easing you into the game, and then ups the difficulty quickly each level.

Cons:
- The filter option doesn't seem to save, nor does the free placement over snap to grid
- Better tracking of how many students for each course and the year, as well as how many teachers/classes you'd need would be a big help
- The 8 student limit for a class seems like a limitation that makes it so you don't want to make your classrooms bigger than necessary

Just little nitpicks, but I like to keep track of the pros and cons when reviewing a game, because no game is perfect, but I think this game is very well done, and really don't have much negative to say about this one.  Mods might eventually fix the few cons I have, but they're so minor it's not really a pressing issue at all.

It's simmilar to 2PH, but I find that they made good use of the engine and mechanics to make a more or less realistic and funny simulation of a campus.

If you like relaxing management games, this one isn't the most action-packed, but it is one that will never overwhelm you. The difficulty curve is just right, and unlike similar management games I feel the goals to complete each level are just right. Nothing ever overstays it's welcome, and I have enjoyed every single level so far.

I've also been surprised at the overall content..I am still less than halfway through all the levels, and I would have been happy with the game if I was nearly done with it already, but I still feel the best, biggest, most creative campuses are still to come! And I just completed the one that is basically Hogwarts from Harry Potter..

There should be more items for excitement levels. The game has very few. I thought maybe more would open up as you go through the boards, and some have..But they are very course specific. if you aren't running that course, they are sort of pointless.. There needs to be more generic entertainment items. 

I also feel that there is a lot of idle time.  In some cases you just get to a point where its just waiting for things to level up. Clubs, students, things of that nature. 

Earning money is definitely way more complicated.  I feel a few boards are set up for failing. I have restarted multiple ones MULTIPLE times..and still cannot pass them. Constantly going negative on the money, getting loans is no help because then you are just paying back loans and never really earning anything. I am at the point now where i have 3 left and last one is still locked but the spy school one, and the 2nd to last one where there is 4 courses to run. The spy school one i have yet to figure out. I believe I am on my 4th or 5th time restarting this one.. trying different things.. so far.. Not working. 

the 2nd to last one (sorry cannot remember the exact name right now)  4 courses right off the bat, getting all the rooms, and staff necessary.. Restarted 3 times so far and i just gave up for now. it just seems impossible. 

I do enjoy the idea of the game. And with the suggested items above, It could be great. 

Side note--- the management view option that is located by the main menu button has stopped working all together with the last update that was made to the game. Not sure why, and honestly i did not use it much except for it to highlight the plots that were available. Not sure if it was just mine or if its consistent with all the PC versions.

There are still some flaws:
- Students are often unhappy for no appearant reason. They have several urgent needs and the facilities are there to satisfy all of them, but they just refuse to do so. Makes sense: if I am hungary, thirsty and need to go to toilet, I am also standing between the toilets, water dispenser and snack shops and feel ... just unhappy.
- At some point it becomes repetitive. The goals are often superficially different, but actually very similar. Sometimes you need to increase attractiveness, sometimes happyness, which can be done in a quite similar way.
- The worst thing is that some goals and they way you can achieve it ... just. doesn't. make. sense. If you need to increase attractiveness to 80%, what will you do? Sure, distribute dozens of copies of the same item over the campus, put the same poster hundrets of times next to each other. Of course this makes the campus 'attractive'. Sometimes, you are even urged to make decisions that would cost every real manager the job just to fulfill a goal. For instance, if your campus is running well, but you need to achieve a higher level, you just build expenseive, but not necessary rooms to increase your 'prestive'. Or to achieve a certain monthly income and are a little bit shy of, you just fire some of your employees to reach the goal. Once you have reached it, it does not matter anymore if your decision caused serious harm to your business in the long term, because the criteria for earning the next star will usually not directly build on top of your previous achievments.

I described the negative points in much more detail, but please don't misunderstand this as being unsatisfied with the game.

First, the difficulty, yeah this is an easy game, but so was TPH until they added REMIX. Besides, this game is significantly more focused on building than TPH (which was already the main aspect of that game), youre not trying to process patients as quickly as possible, but provide a good life for your students with a wide range of items.

Second, the downtime. Yeah i will admit Campus could be better on this, but lets not act like this wasnt also big in Hospital. Taking time to train your staff, decorate, and waiting for the money to build up so you can build that new area. Still, i do think Campus should have had you do the enrollment thing every semester instead of every year. Besides, Hospital was always a chill game first and foremost, actually thats a significant part of why some of its DLCs arent so favorably reveiwed on Steam (even if the larger community likes them).

Lastly, and the one i feel is the least valid, that its a reskin. Really, when you think about it almost every building management games are reskins, build up areas to make money to build up more areas. And i do think that Campus sets itself apart in a way that shakes it down to the core even if it is similar to TPH in many ways. Like i said earlier, the goal is to build a nice college so your students pass their exams, not process patients as fast as possible. As well as Campus giving you greater control over the environment instead of just challenging you to just jigsaw rooms together. Although i do think part of the less warm reception is that it IS a different game from hospital in key areas, and thus it wont be everybody's jam.

Anyways, this is still all subjective, but yeah at least give it a shot, Steam is great about refunds anyways if you dont like it. Also not to mention its only been two weeks and youre seeing people who have 100+ hours, so yeah, speaks to the replayability of this game (which it is a lot more than TPH).",1661375242,1661554259,True,42,2,0.822178363800048828,0,True,False,False

What's great
- More variety, options and depth then Two Point Hospital
- Same great sense of humour
- Most levels have a somewhat challenging start

Concerns
- no mid or late game.  For every level, as long as you don't do something stupid, you can make a profit and then just wait and grow to get 3 stars.  The game needs some significant changes to make it a viable strategy game - forced escalation of courses would be a start, so that an increasing number of rooms is needed.  Other balancing issues.

Pretty much this reeks of a re-skin for quicker development and for publishers to make money with little effort. There are some good quality of life improvements, less micromanaging (although I do wish they kept the assigning personnel, as sometimes I want workers to be SPECIFICALLY for certain buildings (see: Research Only Professors, Marketing Only Assistants, etc.)), and the ability to get a blank plot of land to create your building is a great addition. The funny campus types are also good and bring in some interesting game mechanics.

But the problem with this game actually revolves around the facts that it's a re-skin and the actual game loop. The game loop is this; you set up the course(s) (you have at max 16 total, although 2 should be the max (and 1 is more realistic for the game, I'll explain in a little bit)), you plop down buildings and rooms, hire your personnel, go through the school year (where it's pretty much on auto, not much else outside of training, research, marketing, and scheduling), you get the awards, and you go into Summer School mode. And this is where the re-skin, and the shortcomings of the prior game, collides with the game mechanics and creates issues.

In essence, after the 1st year you are in Summer School mode, and you have objectives that you MUST complete before the next school year. This requires you to; build more buildings/rooms, hire more personnel, and grow your campus. This is where the design issues of TPH smacks up against the wall of the developers not wanting to include VERTICAL DEVELOPMENT (I.E.- FLOORS). You, after a couple of turns in the game loop, will have an impossible issue. The game will demand that you grow out your campus, but you have NO room to do so. At that point, the game is pretty much over with. You can't grow out the campus, you can't grow UP the campus, and you have demands from the game that you can't complete. 

Like I stated before, 2 courses should be the max, but even that is impossible with this game. One course is really maxing the game out, and if you're trying to have anything as close to a real campus (multiple courses per campus), you're out of luck. This is also a shortcoming in comparison to TPH, which while having certain things that each area needs more of, doesn't pigeon hole you into only one avenue for your hospital. 

Again, some good things, it's good for mindless fun. Has the same TP charm. But it also has the same TP issues, and it's basically a re-skin of TPH with a college vibe.",1661367457,1661367457,False,13,2,0.565844416618347168,0,True,False,False

I'm thrilled to see more updates, and I'm sure DLC which unfortunately I will eagerly snag the second I can. The flexibility in building is something I know we were all desperate for with TPH, and it won't let you down here. It just means you spend that much more time redoing literally everything on your campus once you have the funds.

In Two Point Hospital you had some really powerful things like Green Thumb, which really helped with gardening/watering,traits that entertain people they interact with, could be cheaper or more expensive, could learn faster or slower. 

Two Point Campus on the other hand really only has Movement Speed, Littering, and Hygiene, which unfortunately tend to be more negative than positive, and the only one that really matters is littering. It's a real problem regardless of how many trash cans you have, which leads into the second thing. The A.I has some weird prioritizing, especially when you don't have access to address the issues yourself. People are Absolutely Bursting and Filthy, but don't use the Showers, Hand Sanitizers, or Toilets right next to them.
This makes it really hard to complete specific objectives that require a certain threshold to be met.

That being said, if these would be addressed the game would be near perfect. It has far more flexibility than Hospital, and allows for things like make specialty campuses, events allow the game to feel more dynamic. Student requests subtly guide you on what to improve on the most. Different courses require very large facilities instead of the old 3x3 or 5x5, and outdoors has way more going on, including being used for facilities, creating a more picturesque environment, and having a positive affect on people in it.

Buildings are far more flexible, with plots being open to being built ""empty"" or with structures. Now you can build the buildings as you want, with entrances and exits where you want them. This really allows for a huge amount of player agency. It really adds a much needed dimension.

I've played a lot of Two-Point Hospital, so pullover in how the game operates was quite easy due to my experience with their other game.  I can see if I was completely new to the series and how things operate, the instructions for this game in the opening aren't as clear as they could be.  There's a lot of complex concepts that I've picked up from threads and game-experience that aren't lined out in this game.  An example of this, which is new to Two-Point Campus, is the campus building features. I made it through 4 universities, all 3 stars, before figuring out there's a way to build paths.  

Build mode can be a little weird at times (sometimes I consistently click the rooms in an attempt to grab an object that was misplaced instead of actually grabbing the objects).  Overall though, the game is fantastic with just a few little tweaks I'd make to the building portion.  I'd also like a few more screens to be more easily accessible such as job lists -- it'd be nice to see an overall instead of having to go into individual staff screens to get to their job list.  I'd like room objects to function like they did in Two-Point Hospital such as marketing desks and training items.  Right now, you have to click the room to get to training instead of clicking the item. Same with Marketing -- clicking the desk shows you details about the desk, not the actual marketing options.

Overall I'd give the game an 8/10, deducting just a few points off for some awkward building issues (they work, just awkward sometimes), and then issues outlined above. Some things could be explained a little more clearly.  And PLEASE add more entertainment options!

I'm a fan of the Uni theme - especially since I'm a Uni dropout, so I can live vicariously through this game (as well as through Dinosaur Fossil Hunter).

Assuming that you've played Two Point Hospital; the mechanics are largely the same - with improvements of course. For instance, you can now fit in more toilet stalls into a smaller room configuration than you could in Two Point Hospital. Definitely an improvement! Room configurations feel like they have way more options and customisation options than before.

In addition, Assistants are now the MVPs. Like, seriously. They were mostly overlooked in Hospital; now they're arguably the most important. Janitors too. And I'm a fan of this change; it definitely adds way more depth and drive to get everyone trained up as best as they can be.

The UI looks a little different to Hospital, and sort of takes some getting used to. All in all, it's very familiar to before.

At the time of this review (August 2022), there are some minor bugs - nothing game-breaking (that I've experienced, at least), and I'm sure that they'll get ironed out very soon.

Great game; seriously addictive. I've no doubt that I'll go and pick this up on the Switch too, as I had Hospital on all platforms. 

Well worth the price, and I look forward to future expansions.

I Really *really* wanted to like this game, but I just.... don't... After beating the first two campuses I simply have no desire to start a third and my time with TPC is probably already at an end.

The style is very similar to TPH, with the same cute graphics, the same radio presenters and ( possibly unpopular opinion ) many of the same jokes forced into a slightly different context to sound more ""university'y"" Once I noticed this it bugged me more and more. 

For some inexplicable reason they've also added a tonne of menu options and icons that add a never ending cascade of popups and panels for you to scroll through. The result was that I spent more time squinting at button tooltips than playing the game. Despite all the extra UI buttons I still can't find what I'm looking for most of the time (I'm looking at you events organiser screen)

What really lets this game down though is the core gameplay loop. Its just dull. You set up some rooms, click the ""start year"" button and survive a barrage of whiny requests for ""a new bench"" or ""a guitar poster"" (once you've filtered out the incessant monthly profit/loss mails - what was wrong with the TPH style popup!? )  which you dutifully plonk down (literally anywhere) to push a happiness bar up. The academic year ends, some more bars fill up. your progress to ""X/10 students passing whatever"" goes up and you rinse and repeat until you get your next star. 

I was able to define a winning strategy for this game which was to start the year, leave it running in the background for 5 minutes whilst I did something else, return and fulfil all the requests, repeat the cycle until the end of the year and repeat. In my opinion, any game where you can spend  half of your time not playing the game and still win is doing something wrong

You also spend an inordinate amount of time designing rooms to be nice looking. For people who enjoy the sims, that's great, but I've never wanted or cared about attractive rooms. I'm much more interested in playing the game and beating its management challenges. Two Point Hospital was great in that it gave you the choice - want to deck all your GP's offices out with posters? go for it! Want to completely ignore it and occasionally crank out a prestige 5 room to stop a staff member leaving? That's cool too! Being forced into becoming an interior decorator was really not what I wanted to spend my time doing.

After TPH's fast-paced, challenging and complex, but intuitive, overlapping game systems, TPC feels like a ""dumbed down for casual gamers"" clone that somehow manages to port across all of the individual parts of TPH whilst completely losing the heart of what made it great.

You keep on doing the same things over and over again until you get to a point where there are far too many buildings, students, and staff things to keep track of. Definitely not worth 40 bucks. 

Some things are pretty annoying:
1) Cannot build vertically. All rooms and buildings are single-floor only. When was the last time you saw a university with no multi-floor buildings?

2) Every room needs pointless decorations and knick-knacks to increase attractiveness and campus level. I don't understand why staff with their own rooms cannot put up their own posters and other decorations in their rooms?

3) The humorous take on classes seems funny at first but it quickly wears off. Would like to see some actual real-world courses, items, etc. in the game. Some aspects such as those of knight school and intruders are just annoying. 

4) Too much micromanagement in some aspects of the game. You sometimes need to manually assign a private tutor to students who are at risk of failing. Seems enough at first but when you have multiple courses each with 3-4 years of students, it quickly become tiresome to do these assignments manually. 

5) Too many pointless or annoying notifications about students needing love benches, specialty kiosks, parties or events that bury some of the important ones such as students needing items to complete assignments. 

Overall, I think I just find the whole game a bit juvenile and over-the-top for my liking.

A wizarding school plays the same like a gastronomy school, plays the same as a knight school. Nothing ever changes aside from the roomtypes.

Two Point Campus is a game developed by Two Point Studios and published by SEGA

The game has some really beautiful environments and the graphics are really well designed and laid out

The game does suffer with some repetitiveness at certain areas of the game but a fun game nonetheless

Two Point Campus overall, however, is a fun game to play in short bursts and a great simulation game to play and is a wonderful homage to the classics from Bullfrog Productions!

I've played Two Point Hospital and, while a realize that the hospital campuses don't necessarily need multiple stories, Two Point Campus would actually do well with the mechanic. After all, you are managing a freakin' university. There has to be room for all the programs that the university offers (not to mention all the people), and more floors would be the ideal solution. If you run out of room for the different programs, how are you going to expand? Yes, the game is extensive, and you probably won't run into that problem very quickly, but it is still a viable problem, as the possibility of it happening is real. The only reason that I am saying this is because I am seven hours into the game, and there is no multi-story mechanic anywhere to be seen.

It would be nice to have a new mechanic to distinguish it from two-point hospital.

Overall, everything else is good. The fact that you can build a school and allocate different rooms is nice. Also, hiring your own staff is a welcome touch, as it puts in charge of nearly every aspect.

- If you got bored with the hospital environment, this is a game with the same mechanics but in a university setting. 

- They've kept the things that were working in the previous game, such as the radio voice and the the announcer.  There are some items that are the same as before, such as the sanitizer, because well, the real world has become obsessed with it as we all know. 

- At least now we know where the patients with the peculiar diseases come from. This is ground zero for that type of thing. 

Cons:

- If anything, it's easier than the predecessor Two Point Hospital. I've finished my second school with 3 stars and like many reviewers say, you only have to place the items and wait. The quests are easy and there is no challenge. There's a fine balance between relaxing and boring, and Two Point Campus is balancing dangerously close to the boring side. I wouldn't recommend this if you're looking for a bit more of a challenge.

Got a refund as nothing I did could get it to work. Looking around I could not see anyone else having the same issue and so I thought I would have another go. I turned off my anti virus, McAfee, and got it to run. Added it to the list of programs to ignore and turned it back on again and not running again. Well, I say not running, not strictly true. Steam thinks it's running and in the task manager it shows the process but using between 5 and 7 meg of memory that is not doing anything helpful. I have an HP Omen laptop that boosts games, it could be an interaction between that and McAfee I suppose.

So, the game itself. Now it works I can say that if, like me, you like Two Point Hospital, you will like this just as much as TPH. Possibly more when there is a bit more added to the game. Not that there is not enough to play at all. There is plenty and I am really enjoying it.

I know TPH has a lot of DLC and I assume that this will happen for TPC as well and I will probably get those too, I have all the TPH ones so the odds are def stacked in that direction.",1660229201,1660636137,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The longer story is, although this is essentially Two Point Hospital with a college instead, that is exactly the problem. The hospital one was a continuous affair, where at any moment the composition of the patients could start to change, or you'd just get more of them, so it was a continuous action and reaction. The college format splits it into school years and vacations, with the courses (and thus number of students) only changing between years, and thus no real reason to build more classes or hire more teachers other than between the years. The game also tells you exactly what rooms and what teachers you'll need over the next year, so again, it's not a dynamic do this and react to that affair like in TPH. Just meet those requirements and then sit and watch for a year.

Worse yet, although the game doesn't force you to, it strongly rewards sitting on your butt during that vacation, dismissing employment candidates until a more qualified one shows up. I mean, you could hire the first teacher that pops up, and then spend a small fortune and two years training them to level 5 in whatever course they're teaching, or sit and wait until a level 5 on shows up. Which is very boring.

The gaining experience and levels from TPH is also gone, basically giving you one less thing to react to.

Add to that such tasks as ""make 5000$ a month profit"" to clear the last star of a level. Since one time stuff like research don't count, essentially you may find yourself just waiting for a month where the student experience bonus pushes you just over the threshold. Since xp is gained faster at low levels, AND you can only add more students for a new year, essentially that tends to be one of the very first months of a year. Then you'll twiddle your thumbs for the rest of the year, hoping you can do better the next one. Again, that's very boring, and I consider including such tasks to be simply bad game design.

Now add some more niggling details, like that the AI seems a bit... lobotomized. I've repeatedly watched such stuff as a janitor just running back and forth because it can't seem to decide between two tasks, and ending up doing neither until something else to do appears.

Now also add such... bizarre decisions as that you can't increase a lecture room's capacity by adding more chairs, nor does there seem to be any obvious way to increase the number of lecture rooms for a course and year. You can and will literally end up with stuff like 31 students for year 1 and the fixed 8 students capacity for the lecture room. I realize that they had to make other stuff like the private tuition and library and upgrading other rooms too useful SOMEHOW, but it seems bizarre that adding 8 more seats in the lecture room doesn't actually increase its capacity.

Etc.

On the whole, it's not the worst game, especially during the summer draught of new games, and you can get some enjoyment out of it. Hence the tentative thumbs up.

I put a lot of time into Two Point Hospital and whilst most of the game was great, it was ultimately ruined by two specific mechanics: too many GP visits, and patients walking to the other side of the hospital for a drink and messing up queues. 

I'm pleased to say that TP Campus has yet to serve up any game breaking designs!

Not only that, but TP Campus has taken what was in Hospital and taken the next step. There is more customisation options, more creativity, more interesting behaviours from your students. The two biggest features that make this game stand out to me (compared to hospital):

1) Build your own buildings!
I only unlocked this on the 3rd level, but you don't have to accept their building layout! You can destroy, build or edit any campus buildings, getting the perfect size and layout for your vision. No more struggling to squeeze in large rooms into a small building! Just make the building bigger!

2) Outdoor space is useful:
Hospital was all about rooms and hallways, but Campus is really about the whole campus space. Put down gardens, create outdoor foodhalls, create romantic little nooks, put down club meeting spaces etc. Lay paths, put down mowed lawns, hedges, lighting, heating etc. No longer do u have to fill your corridors with benches, put those benches outside!


If you've played these sorts of games before, you won't be challenged. It's not a difficult game. But the added creativity is a real step up and will extend the lifespan. If you want to, each level really is a blank canvas, so replaying a level will genuinely give u a different experience to before.",1660599500,1660599500,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The core gameplay has been reversed from Two Point Hospital/Theme Hospital. In those games you had patients arrive who needed treatment within a timeframe or they would die or leave, and you would fail. You therefore had to manage your spending and staff to ensure you were capable of dealing with random influxes of patients requiring specific treatment etc.

In two point campus you build the facilities necessary for students and THEN the students arrive. Meaning you can never really lose and there is never any challenge whatsoever. The game just becomes sitting and waiting for enough money to come in to build more facilities, at which point you can invite more students...

There was the potential for a great game here. The humour is good, the diversity of buildings and characters is excellent. It's an improvement on Hospital in every way EXCEPT the gameplay. The problem is, it's a game, so that's a fairly big caveat.... 

If they bring out a DLC campaign or sandbox that offers some sort of challenge mode it could end up being a great game.

1649080,120579660,76561198031655520,0,3,2312,0,834,1660898877,"  If I you're thinking of buying this game and want some insight, I'd say this: the biggest difference between 2PCampus and 2PHospital is that, in 2PHospital, your management/activities are pretty similar year-round; months don't make a difference except for payroll. In that sense, your playstyle doesn't really change - you feel continual growth. In 2PCampus, you spend the ""school-season"" doing micro actions like taking care of student grades, fixing up some infrastructure, hosting events, and buying new things that your students need. After the school year, you spend the ""off-season"" making macro-decisions like larger campus changes, adding courses, building management, etc. 

  I think Two Point Campus hits the perfect balance of being familiar enough yet different; it uses all the same systems as Two point Hospital, but you're NOT building a hospital. And because of that, things are a little different. 
 
 We don't get the sandbox/discovery aspect of finding a new disease and then trying to build systems to handle it. Instead, a lot of the focus is on a combination of infrastructure management (building design/placement) and micro-management (making sure certain students don't fail, ensuring proper staffing, hiring better teachers).

  The music is ok, they pay homage to 2PHospital in some of the dialogue (which I find cute), and the UI is pretty clean. I love the addition of landscape customization, so you can choose your own building layout and outdoor pathways (I always had an issue with awkward 2PHospital layouts). Lastly, I love how students have more personality than 2PHospital patients; they have archetypes, they make social connections, join clubs, have dates, ... and if you're like me and decide to name a few, you'll feel a bit sad when they graduate and disappear into the nether. 

 If you like the -concept- of university management, I think you'll love Two Point's take on this game.

First of all, the game is genuinely quite fun, if you are relying on the humor, and gimmick's that made Two Point Hospital great. Otherwise, if you are buying this, expecting a fully different game, don't. It is indeed, exactly like the first game, without very much difference, except that you are building a college, instead of a hospital, and that comes with a few new quirks.

The game is a solid 8-12 hours, to complete, depending on if ya rush, though I'm sure someone could do it a lot quicker. I didn't encounter many bugs during that time, aside from students and rarely, a staff member, just walking around, both needing to take the biggest dump of their lives, and also smelling astoundingly bad, but apparently not having enough time to do that inbetween the entire school year. It's able to be worked around, but it certainly needs to be looked at by the Dev Team.

It's very easy to cheese this game, and admittedly, I most certainly did for the Archeology mission (Thanks SpiffingBrit!) but for the most part, no cheese is needed. You really don't feel inclined to add other courses during a mission either, cause you don't really need to unless the game specifies that you to. Just go at your own pace the entire game, as there isn't really anything time limited.

Overall I'd rate the game a low 8/10 for me personally. It needs a bit more character, and a fare bit more additions for it to go up in my book, If you didn't like Two Point Hospital, don't buy this. You won't enjoy it.

So if you enjoy the original game, and have the money to spend, then I would say go for it!

Here are some things I really like about the game.
1. Love the look of each each campus and the classroom machines are so cute.
2. I'm happy that they have allowed us to be able to change colors on the furniture - like the beds have several different bedspreads that you can choose from to better fit your room design.
3. The Devs put a lot of effort in the design of the furniture and machine and it is really appreciated.
4. I especially like how you can free-build your lots.  Love this option as I like making the shapes of my building to fit to my classrooms and not trying to fit my classroom in a predetermined building - really a wonderful idea.
5. You can save you room as a blueprint so you do not have to recreate it.
6. I do wish we had more ""items"" available in the game, but I sure more will come with the DLC - AND, I can't wait to see what the Devs come up with for those. 
~Edited - It seems that more items show up the more you advance in the game so I needed to update my review to say WOOHOO!
7. Love how we can decorate the outside of the building by adding trees, flower plots, and benches.

Some problems I found are...
1. Students show needing to go to the bathroom even when they are standing right next to one, yet they move away and do a potty dance for a long time before finally making it to the bathroom - not sure if this is by design or an issue with the game. Same goes for showers.
2. I noticed that the tutor teacher's hand disappear into the desk a lot.

Great game Devs!  I still have two more campuses to grow, but I can't wait to see what comes next.  

Edited to add -  I just love all the thought that went into this game.  Yes, I've had a couple of glitches, but over all the game is running really well for me.   I love 2PT Hospital!  And, now I love 2PT Campus.",1660278947,1660417829,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

TP Campus offers you the ability to build your dream Campus, but overloads your schedule with the Sisyphean task of micromanaging literally EVERYTHING. Once you are done with 1 step, the next step comes with the next Sisyphean task.

While playing, I never felt the game to be fun as much as it was a tedious work that required constant input from my side. The game could really be worth it if:

A.) Student Sleeping Quarters > should be automated as an option
Meaning that you set the general room dimensions and how many student(s) you want to sleep in there and everything they place in that room, depending on what type of student(s) lives in that room is up to them and fully automated.

I felt that copying Sleeping Quarter after Sleeping Quarter was a hassle and that the 'standardized' rooms didnt remotely match with what a student of whatever character would put in there if given the chance. Because I cant create a bazillion different Sleeping Quarters for each student type, my Sleeping Quarters didnt have any character and killed a good portion of the immersion at hand. This is just too much work.

B.) Recreation Rooms (Student Lounge, Teachers Lounge) > should be automated as an option
Same explanation as with A.), these rooms should get their character from their inhabitants instead of from me. I would never be able to include all the possible characteristics from each student that dwells there and the task again is way too tedious.

C.) Parks > should be automated as an option
Same explanation as with A.), Parks get their character from the people that go there, not from me. The automation should happen by placing boundaries in which fitting items get placed automatically based on a selected Theme.

Having to place each item and also the floorings is just too much work. I want to concentrate my efforts on the main rooms of the Campus, where the learning and teaching happens.

After 'ending' map 1 with 2 Stars rating, Star 3 asked for an even bigger Campus, I already have no more incline to go for the 2nd Campus map. This is beyond bad.

Sadly, cannot recommend this game,

I felt an huge difference between the console and pc version, at switch all my students were doing great, almost instantly got to C grade and their needs were easily met.

First off the game introduces you to the different game mechanics through its campaign that you can play (if you so choose) or if you want to skip all of that, you can go straight into sandbox style. I love that each and every instance where the campaign takes you, that each and every one of them have a different theme from the last. You can start off with the vanilla university campus as an intro then you can do a cooking school, then sports school and even a whacky wizard school (that is totally not a rip off :P).

Secondly, the management part of the game where you have to maintain a flow of income while maintaining standards in the school, is to be frank, very intuitive. For example in the wizarding school, you are presented with a challenge where you start off with a debt and not a lot of funds at the beginning. So you have to strike a balance between not going too much into debt while also making sure your students have the resources to succeed in their courses. The game keeps you motivated by presenting challenges that add onto the overall goal of the game. I feel that managing the finances is much easier in this game than Two Point Hospital, but I think that's because monetary and financial rewards are coupled so well with how well the students are doing academically (as opposed to in Two Point hospital where it's a basic cash flow in/out). This means that the better the students are doing in your school, the better your school's finances will be. If the students are not learning well (because you didn't build any private tutors, for example), your school will suffer. I feel that the game mechanics integrate well into each other in this game.

Lastly, I like that Two Point Campus kept its quirky and whacky charms from its last iteration. There's just so many cool and funny things that I find myself excited to see what kind of whacky or quirky thing was I going to see next. 

I feel that the game is complete and does not lack in any features at all and I am excited to see what kind of DLCs we are going to get for this game.

Overall, I highly recommend this game. This game is super chill but with enough funny elements that will keep you interested. It is an improvement from the previous game (Two Point Hospital) as I can clearly see that the devs learned from the feedback they received. Get this game is you want a fun builder/management sim with a Two Point charm! :D

[b]Two Point Campus[/b] is a College and University management simulator from the creators of Two Point Hospital. This game allows you to build and customise a campus and hire, train, and care for teachers as well as teaching and caring for students by giving them special rooms; there are a plethora of fun locations and a boat load of fun courses to select for your campus. Throughout the standard game you will be tackling many different features and different problems to come across, unlocking Sandbox after the fourth campus you can have full free reign to your hearts desire. 

Whether you want to specialise your campus in sports, science, archaeology, knights, or even magic, there is a ton of varied and unique gameplay.

[h1]Pros[/h1]
- Great Cartoony Graphics
- Seventeen Courses to Specialise
- Lots of Fun Decoration (Some even have animations)
- Varieties of Lovely Campus Locations
- Different Modes in Sandbox
- Lots of Fun Rooms and Buildings

[h1]Cons[/h1]
- Sometimes selecting objects or rooms can be finicky. Multiple times i've tried to pick up an object behind a big object but despite there clearly being space enough for me to click it, it selected the bigger object in the foreground so the hit boxes can be annoying often.
- Sandbox isn't available from the start, you have to unlock it after the fourth campus. I'm fine with it due to the fact the first four campuses are more like tutorials, however, i know it can be annoying for some.

It plays like two Point Hospital but it's quite different in terms of flow. There's also, in some ways, way more complexity. The game is fun and interesting.

The graphics are great and the game has it's own charm. It looks and feels good to play. It's snappy and often everything works as it's intended to. 

The music is really good. I love the soundtrack to this game. The audio and commentary are great too, it adds a lot of character to the game.

I feel like this game gives you more information than Two Point Hospital. There's a ton of filters and screens to managing and seeing where things are going. The complexity is in there. 

My only complaint is sometimes there's some editor bugs.. where I place and thing and the editor says it's fine and then I add something somewhere else and it says it's not fine anymore. Even though the items aren't close as all. Essentially the editor gives ""false positives"" on item placement.

The other thing is pathing. Sometimes students just bug out. They'll run into a door or wall a bunch and then finally find their way in.

I really didn't care that much when patients died unless it counteracted a specific hospital goal or my janitors were too busy to clean up the ghosts promptly. In Campus, however, you actually have a chance (and reason) to become attached to a few of your students. They have much more personality and interesting animations (even developing relationships). Plus you follow them all throughout to graduation to develop that attachment.

I also personally find the course variety more interesting than the illness variety in Hospital, and the customization has seen a boost as well. I can only see this being further improved with time.

There are some flaws and poor choices, though. For one, Campus is every bit as slow to open up as Hospital. You unlock things star by star in the story campaign portion. There is a true sandbox mode you can indulge (and I appreciate it), but you still have to complete the most basic of tutorials to access it. I can tolerate this, but I can definitely see the drag dropping others. Further, and maybe this is just me, but I expected to see more nods to Hospital with medical students.

I've pretty much been playing non-stop since release when I'm at home. There's definitely a lot more to do here, but it's basically the same concept. Meet the goals, build up your property, don't go broke. I'm already ready for DLC lol.

PROS
-You can now edit outside of the building, and you can put buildings down in any configuration over blank areas you've purchased (or, if you'd prefer, you can have them build it for you).
-They've added a lot more in terms of game play. You can schedule events in certain rooms, decorate outside (see previous point), choose and upgrade the programs your campus provides, and more.
-The new friends and sweethearts feature is pretty cute. I think the Double Jump Bed is funny.
-Clubs are super useful. I like that you can encourage certain skills based on your play style and student needs.
-I have no idea why but the bookworms are satisfying to catch. You do get a small reward, but I just enjoy catching them. I would buy these as plushies, no hesitation.
-Pride flag? Pride flag. I hope they add more in the future.
-More radio DJs for variety. It isn't the same three over and over. They're here, but more have been added. P.S. the joke about Tarquin Foxbridge blowing his nose on official documents kills me, or any joke at his expense really, especially as an educator myself.

CONS
-The game sort of assumes you've played Two Point Hospital. There is a bit of tutorial, but if you haven't played the first game you might be a bit confused.
-The UI is clunky. I've played for 15 hours and sometimes I still forget where to go to find what I need. I know TPH has a bit less in terms of things to do, but the UI was much smoother.
-The AI on the Peeps can seem to be a little wonky. For example, I have bathrooms in the most accessable places in every building, but they'll still wait until bursting to go. They'll go to class while bursting or starving, which lowers my school rating or even triggers the drop-out warning.
-Getting staff without segnificant 'bad' traits is a chore. Maybe I just got bad RNG, but it takes a long time to get staff without bad traits, or at least the bad traits I'm willing to tolerate. So many have Bin-Blindness and that's a no go for me, especially when you have objectives for attractiveness. There are already students with Bin-Blindness, so having staff with it as well makes a mess. I wonder if there's a way to add on to training that would help lessen the affects of their bad traits.
-At the end of the academic year, if you upgrade courses you also need to upgrade your campus by buying new rooms or hiring staff. The problem is, you have to sort of anticipate how much money you'll need to fund this since you don't earn tuition money during this period. During the academic year there are lots of expenses and you often need to buy or research items for courses or the Peeps will get a bad grade, fail, or even drop out.

I don't normally review games on Steam, but Two Point Campus is worthy of an exception. If you played Two Point Hospital and enjoyed it, but eventually lost interest because the monotony of the game play set in, then this game is 100% for you.

This reason I'm writing this is solely to highlight how Two Point has looked critically at Hospital and reworked things to fix a lot of the gameplay weaknesses in Campus. Some of the noteable ones:

[list]
[*] You are encouraged and rewarded for adding a [i]variety[/i] of items to rooms. Gone are the days of certificate spam.
[*] Because you're encouraged to add lots of things, it also makes sense to make [i]rooms bigger than their minimum required size[/i].
[*] The focus is shifted from getting things done quickly to [i]getting things done right[/i]. No more is the sole focus on processing people as quickly as possible, a much higher emphasis is on quality since, well, you're stuck with student for a whole year.
[*] Everyone knows you can build buildings now. The side-effect of course is that now if you're just one square shy of building something you need in a building you can just... [i]make buildings bigger[/i].
[*] Better customization... and combined with different student types, different classes, [i]customizing things is something you might actually bother with[/i]. Landscape paints and outdoor customization, 'nuf said.
[*] Students are just [i]more interesting[/i] than patients. How many times did you really look at patient panes other than to check how long they have before they'd die? Since students are the focus, I find myself glancing at what clubs people are joining, how their friendships are going, and such. Also their grades I guess, minor detail that.
[*] BONUS: I love that the announcements reference to Hospital. Nice touches like that are all over the place in this game.[/list]

That said, I only have a couple gripes:
[list]
[*] Staff management seems [i]worse[/i] than Hospital. There used to be a pane where you could quickly set up the roles for all staff. Either I'm an idiot and can't find it (very possible), or you're now stuck doing it for each individual staff member.
[*] Add more music!
[*] The class scheduler is... imperfect. I understand it's a complex problem to solve, but I've had at least one instance where I [i]knew[/i] the class schedule could be condensed to eliminate the need for an entire class room, and I had to twiddle with the allowed-courses settings to get it to find that solution.
[*] Some of the class-specific items are just... too big, given the minimum class size. They fit, but take [i]the whole room[/i]. I know I said this game rewards you for larger rooms, but this is just an annoyance (sometime you just want a small room) and feels like it was done to artificially force players to build bigger rooms.[/list]

As for 2PC, art style is the same, which I like. Game play is similar but the mechanics are obviously different as you run a college campus not an hospital.

All in all a very enjoyable game, looking forward to the DLCs (if reasonably priced, otherwise its wait for the sales).

Graphically its very much akin to Two Point Hospital, the cartoony characters are cute to watch running around and depict their styles very well from the tux wearing rich kids to the clowny class clowns, everything is visually represented well. If I have one complaint about the graphic style it would be that the individual course teachers could use better variation. Unlike the students, teachers all wear a similar style and while you can unlock color variations, it ultimately lacks the flare the students have.

Sound wise everything sounds nice, the parties however are a bit quiet. Any time I schedule a band event unless I zoom in on the band the music is almost completely drowned out by the rest of the ambiant sounds of the campus.

Gameplay... it's addictive. It's not overly challenging by any means but trying for the 3 star on each campus can be a great time sink. I'm 14 hours in and only two star on the third campus. If you're careful it's very unlikely you'll need to ever get a bank loan to fund your building as your first couple of years in any campus can be used freely to generate funds. If you stick to how the tutorial has you build it's near impossible to fail. Now challenge aside the missions are cute but ultimately aren't that notable. Unlike hospital where an influx of special patients see unique figures around... events in campus are very room based and easy to overlook the signature figures that arrive and the events tend to get requested/spammed so often you ultimately lose any care about seeing the characters.

Ultimately it's a fun game, good for anyone that enjoys doing this sort of Do X, get Y, evolve to Z missions. I look forward to the sandbox but to be honest the campuses beyond the first are large and unlocks opened later are usable in prior campuses so even before unlocking sandbox it's a fun little management sim with loads of room to expand.",1660181314,1660181314,True,1,0,0.52808988094329834,0,True,False,False

Honestly, from the moment I opened the game I was just immediately repelled. Especially with the lady in the background making weird comments. Couldn't even get through the tutorial, it was too slow and too darn annoying with the audio.

And I think that's what put me off the most, the audio is just weird and bad. The gameplay didn't draw me in, and it just left me thinking about other games that are similar and more fun.

If you liked Hospital, or any kind of non-realistic management sim, you'll probably enjoy this. Admittedly I was a little worried that it looked like I was near the end already at one point, but more things unlocked after that! One of the things I like about this game is you can take it seriously and hyper customise everything, but you just as easily cheese it a bit and you're not really punished for that (as in, it's a play how you most like to play type of game).

The one negative I do have is the management aspect has been stripped compared with Hospital. I know a lot of people will see less micromanagement as a positive, but it was really frustrating to not be able to alter certain things 

For example, you have a job role 'assistants' who do a lot of wildly different things on campus. At one point in the game, you will fail if you don't have enough medical facilities, which are run by these assistants with special training. However, sometimes they abandon those rooms in favour of standing outside club stands... even though dozens of students are in line. You literally have to ban every single assistant one by one from working specific roles. In Hospital, this was easily managed on one screen for everyone and I really miss it here. I also really wish there was a way to swap around the queue priorities. Or, at least, sick students shouldn't be in class or something. This is the one major bottleneck I've come across in game. 

Plus, it seems a little weirdly restrictive that you can't customise your class schedules at all, even though there's a whole screen for it. Why must all classes be in fixed time slots? It seriously hurts my efficiency brain to have all my students doing nothing for a whole month as all classrooms stay empty. 

I'm hoping for a quality of life update at some point on these, especially the management UI. Other than that though, definitely worth your time. Obviously the price is a little steep, but you are seriously getting hours of content. I haven't even completed the campaign yet, and I feel like this will lend itself to sandbox mode more than Hospital did with all the extra decoration options.",1660162827,1660163250,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's like a sequel that changes the theme. However, it's not a queue simulator like TPH. You aren't researching illnesses. You aren't trying to get your patients through the pipeline ASAP. Instead, you have a fixed period (school year) in which to make things happen. You have to get your students up to snuff before the end of this period or it's bad news.

Overall, the game is not difficult, but I honestly find it reasonably challenging. In the 2nd stage, I am constantly having to juggle loans in order to meet the requirements of my upgraded courses: build this, build that, hire this -- that's $120k total and I don't have that on hand, so I need a loan. Loans have interest and installment payments that drag down profits. I'm still profitable many months, but not by much. I could probably have just skated by on the status quo for another school year to grind cash, but the game allows me to keep pushing if I want to.

Anyway, a lot of love obviously went into this game. It's funny and weird, lots of cute stuff. Most of the stages are themed, so you'll get decent variety -- normal school, culinary school, Harry Potter school.

There are many out here, who played Two Point Hospital before. I am not one of them. I'm also not a frequent management game player. But the humour and the university theme itched a nerve for me and after the first trailers and then reviews I had to get it. So take this into consideration.

[h1] What to expect[/h1]
You're managing a University. But is it just one? No! The game has a story mode and a sandbox mode. To get to the sandbox mode you have to play through the first few levels though (I haven't unlocked it yet after finishing the first two levels, but I took my time and got three stars in both of them, you only need one per level, so you might unlock it a fair bit quicker). 
So, about the ""story"" mode. You start with a small campus in England and have two establish two different courses. The game uses this to softly get you to learn the game's mechanics. For me - as a novice - this was very welcome. In each level you have to achieve certain goals to get a star. You do this over the course of a year, you have to build student facilities, class rooms, all these things. And you have to make sure, your students pass their classes. But that's not been to challenging so far. 
Once you have the first star you can choose two tackle the next challenges to get up to three stars, or you move on to the next campus.
The different campuses (?) have varying themes. The second one is in an old Italian-like town for example and you focus on cooking courses with giant pizzas. Over the course of the game you can expect knights, wizards, sports, robots and all kind of stuff. 
As I am still early on in the game I can't judge all of it, but to me it seems to be very diverse and fun! The game doesn't take itself to serious. On that note, there's also an in game radio with Bri'ish comments that are quiet funny.

Apart from managing and building rooms you also have to take care of your staff.

What you probably shouldn't expect is a hard game. It is very beginner friendly. In the second university I had to look a little more on the money at first, but that passed rather quickly. For me as a novice in this field this is nice and feels right.

[h1] Bugs? [/h1]
In the Italian town, which might actually be French as well, now that I'm thinking about it, the rain contains frogs. Apart from that the only books I've met so far are book worms.

On a serious note:
- apparently the A button can't be mapped differently to move left. I didn't note this, as I use my mouse to move.
- One time I wanted to move a room and a bunch of other objects in other rooms would show they can't be placed like that anymore, which would have required quiet a bit of work. In the end I just didn't move the room and in other instances I didn't have the problem. But there might be some challenges to the placing system.

[h1] Other frustrations [/h1]
As I use my mouse to move and move the camera, I would prefer to be able to move the camera both up and down and turn left and right at the same time (like in The Sims for example). Like this I have to stop one movement and start the next. You get used to it and it might be very specific to me, but I would like it differently.

And when you place all the objects, some of them require to be accessible for the janitors to be serviced. This mechanic isn't bad. But getting it just rights can be a bit tricky. You can user Ctrl. To fine tune it, but it still is a bit icky.

In general the UI is very nice and works well. But you can toggle specific actions per person, like sending them to 1 on 1 tutoring and I couldn't really tell what was on and what was off, as for this there was no fly over as there is for other things, telling you what something does/is.

[h1] General Flow of The Game [/h1]
I think the game has a very nice flow. When you build new rooms it immediately shows you all the fitting and suitable furniture for example. Also it has a good pace for me so far. One year doesn't take to long. I'd say it's about an hour in real life. Then you have the summer break to prepare your campus for the next year, build new rooms for new or upgraded course. Here you can take as long as you like, before you start back into the school year. And then you still have the option to actually pause your game.
So far this all works very well for me with a good feeling of progression.

[h1] Would I recommend it? [/h1]
Yes, absolutely. I've had lots of fun so far and unlike other (micro)managing games this has an entrance that hooked me instead of spooking me. It's fool of humour and crazy ideas. Not your everyday university life. 
It's not a hardcore game. This is for a relaxed evening and watching your fantastic university and all the life it contains. It's also fun to just watch that.
So give it a go!

I might update this further down the line, but for now that's it folks!

But there is one INEXCUSABLE AND INFURIATING issue - if it detects a controller, it FORCES you to use it!

There's NO MENU ITEM to switch back to mouse and keyboard. This is insane! Because of my setup [my fault] every time I unplug my controller, and want to use it again, I have to restart my PC - so now, every time I want to play this game, I'll have to do that.

It is a different game for sure and the changes are great. Having students for multiple years and many of the aspects of student life in the form of relationships, events, dorms, and even clubs are fun additions. 

If you enjoyed Two Point Hospital I highly recommend this game. It by no means is a reskin, plenty of new elements.
