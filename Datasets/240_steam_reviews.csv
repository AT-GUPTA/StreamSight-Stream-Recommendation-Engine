From dynamic maps to a variety of weaponry, this Game delivers unmatched excitement and strategic depth.  One of the standout features of this Game is its emphasis on teamwork and communication.  Players must work together to outsmart their opponents, whether it's planting bombs or rescuing hostages.  This fosters a sense of camaraderie and cooperation that few other games can match.  However, VIP mode, which was unique in the CS.16 era, has been removed, perhaps because some players or the community don't like it, you can still play it if you add additional mods.

  The graphics on this game, even by today's standards, hold up very well.  The environments are very detailed, and the character models are very realistic.  Every shot and explosion feels visceral and impactful.  Counter-Strike: Source also offers a dynamic community that guarantees endless replay value.  With so many custom maps, game modes, and player-created mods, the possibilities are nearly endless.  Whether you're a casual player looking for a quick thrill or a competitive player looking to test your skills, there's something for everyone.  With addictive gameplay, stunning visuals, and a thriving community, it's no surprise that this game has stood the test of time.

  PhysX in this game is better than CS2, additional maps and mods on the community server make the game develop and become busy because of the excitement created on the community server.

Rating: ★★★★★

Counter-Strike: Source, developed by Valve Corporation, stands as a timeless classic in the first-person shooter genre, blending intense tactical gameplay with strategic depth to create an enduring multiplayer experience. Originally released in 2004, the game remains relevant and beloved, thanks to its engaging mechanics, competitive community, and the enduring legacy of the Counter-Strike series.

The core of Counter-Strike: Source lies in its straightforward yet profoundly engaging premise – two teams, terrorists and counter-terrorists, face off in objective-based rounds. Whether it's rescuing hostages or planting bombs, the game's focus on strategic team play and skillful shooting has been the hallmark of its success.

One of the standout features of Counter-Strike: Source is the precise gunplay. Weapons have a realistic feel, and mastering recoil patterns becomes a crucial aspect of becoming a skilled player. The game's simplicity in terms of weapon loadouts and equipment fosters a level playing field where victory is determined by skill, strategy, and communication.

The maps in Counter-Strike: Source are iconic, each offering unique challenges and opportunities for both teams. From the narrow streets of de_dust2 to the close-quarters combat of cs_office, the level design is thoughtful and contributes to the game's balance. The emphasis on map control and understanding chokepoints creates a dynamic experience where no match feels the same.

The graphics, even though they may show their age compared to contemporary titles, maintain a certain charm. The simplicity of the visual design doesn't detract from the gameplay, and the optimization allows the game to run smoothly on a wide range of hardware, making it accessible to a broad audience.

Counter-Strike: Source has a robust and passionate community, which has played a significant role in its enduring popularity. Custom maps, game modes, and the introduction of community-created content keep the experience fresh and contribute to the game's longevity.

While the absence of a progression system or unlockable content might be seen as a drawback in the modern era of gaming, Counter-Strike: Source relies on its pure gameplay to keep players hooked. The focus on skill-based competition and the thrill of intense firefights compensate for the lack of cosmetic rewards or character customization.

In conclusion, Counter-Strike: Source remains an exemplar of tactical multiplayer shooters. Its enduring popularity, precise gameplay mechanics, and vibrant community showcase the timeless appeal of a game that has left an indelible mark on the world of competitive gaming. For those seeking a classic and skill-driven multiplayer experience, Counter-Strike: Source is an absolute must-play.",1708474305,1708474305,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In the realm of dreams, where shadows dance,
I walk a path, taking a chance.
Every step I take, I'm unsure where I'll land,
Among the skulls, crumbling in sand.
Growing up in dreams, where reality's blurred,
Never knowing what's real, every vision obscured.
I tread on skulls, with every step I take,
Deeper into hell, with each move I make.
Through the misty haze, I wander alone,
In this surreal world, where nightmares are sown.
Echoes of laughter, whispers of dread,
In this twisted land, where souls are led.
Growing up in dreams, where reality's blurred,
Never knowing what's real, every vision obscured.
I tread on skulls, with every step I take,
Deeper into hell, with each move I make.
Amidst the chaos, I find my way,
Through the darkest night, I'll face the fray.
In this labyrinth of dreams, I'll brave the fight,
For in the depths of hell, I'll find my light.
Growing up in dreams, where reality's blurred,
Never knowing what's real, every vision obscured.
I tread on skulls, with every step I take,
Deeper into hell, with each move I make.
The land beneath me, made of skulls and bone,
Stretching far and wide, an endless zone.
Crucifixes rise, like beacons in the night,
Guiding me forward, through this eerie sight.
Growing up in dreams, where reality's blurred,
Never knowing what's real, every vision obscured.
I tread on skulls, with every step I take,
Deeper into hell, with each move I make.
Through the endless expanse, I journey on,
Past forgotten souls, their voices gone.
In this realm of dreams, where time stands still,
I search for meaning, amidst the thrill.
Growing up in dreams, where reality's blurred,
Never knowing what's real, every vision obscured.
I tread on skulls, with every step I take,
Deeper into hell, with each move I make.
As daemons prowl the land, their eyes aglow,
A lone figure stands, against the infernal show.
The last of mankind, with no one left to call,
Facing demons and darkness, standing tall.
We thought it'd be Marril or Cuthbert, next in line,
But fate had its twist, it chose this soul divine.
The worst sinner, with more kills than Hitler's reign,
Now facing eternity, in this realm of pain.
Growing up in dreams, where reality's blurred,
Never knowing what's real, every vision obscured.
I tread on skulls, with every step I take,
Deeper into hell, with each move I make.",1587156976,1707668209,True,1,0,0.306666672229766846,0,True,False,False

Developed by Valve Corporation, this classic title has stood the test of time, proving that exceptional gameplay and a dedicated community can transcend generations.

At its core, Counter-Strike: Source remains a pinnacle of competitive FPS gaming. The game's simple yet elegant premise pits terrorists against counter-terrorists in intense, round-based scenarios. The emphasis on teamwork, strategic planning, and skillful gunplay is as relevant today as it was upon the game's launch. The well-balanced weapons, each with its distinct characteristics, contribute to the game's enduring appeal, offering a level playing field that rewards player skill above all else.

Visually, Counter-Strike: Source has aged gracefully. The source engine's capabilities, even in its earlier iteration, provide a clean and polished aesthetic. The maps, whether classic or community-created, boast a level of design sophistication that ensures dynamic and engaging gameplay. The game's performance is commendable, allowing for smooth and responsive action even on modern hardware.

What sets Counter-Strike: Source apart is its unrivaled focus on skill-based gameplay. The game demands precision, reflexes, and tactical acumen from players, creating an environment where mastery is rewarded and every match is a learning opportunity. The absence of modern gaming conveniences, such as regenerating health or loadout customization, adds to the purity of the experience, making it a haven for those seeking a genuine and challenging FPS encounter.

The vibrant and dedicated community surrounding Counter-Strike: Source is a testament to its enduring legacy. Active player communities, esports tournaments, and a continuous influx of new content through mods and maps ensure that the game remains vibrant and relevant in the contemporary gaming landscape. The longevity of its popularity is a testament to the game's ability to foster a sense of camaraderie and competition that few titles have achieved.

While other FPS games may boast cutting-edge graphics and innovative mechanics, Counter-Strike: Source remains a beacon of excellence in its genre. Its ability to provide a pure and uncompromising FPS experience has secured its place as a classic, and the fact that it continues to attract players and maintain an active community speaks volumes about its enduring perfection. Counter-Strike: Source is not just a game; it's a testament to the timeless appeal of skill-based, competitive shooting that transcends generations of gaming.",1703732966,1705839346,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Com gráficos que hipnotizam e mecânicas de jogo refinadas, CS: GO não é apenas um jogo, mas uma experiência imersiva que desafia a mente e a habilidade dos jogadores.

A precisão cirúrgica exigida para triunfar nas partidas eleva o CS: GO a um patamar superior, onde cada movimento, cada escolha tática, e cada disparo conta. A intensidade do jogo é palpável, como um confronto de titãs, onde a comunicação entre os membros da equipe é a chave para a vitória. O trabalho em equipe é mais do que uma estratégia, é uma sinfonia harmoniosa de habilidades individuais se fundindo para formar uma força imparável.

Os mapas meticulosamente projetados servem como palcos para confrontos épicos, proporcionando ambientes variados e desafiadores que demandam adaptação constante. A rivalidade entre terroristas e contra-terroristas cria uma tensão narrativa que eleva a experiência a um nível emocional, onde cada rodada é um capítulo na história em constante evolução.

[b][u] Short Review [/u][/b] :
Every 20+ Years old gamer know this game (along with its various version). This game (along with various valve game) is a timeless game that you and i can still enjoy. The bot is alright, the graphic (in this one) is great/pretty. the sound is great.

Not really many people play this one (well that or me just enjoy playing with bots), but i think the community is still there so you might find people to play with.

Short conclusion? This game is [h3] 9 out of ten [/h3] [b] for a multiplayer game. [/b]

Review:
With 15.0 hours of fragging, strategizing, and pure adrenaline rushes, Counter-Strike: Source continues to prove why it's a timeless classic in the world of FPS gaming.

Likes:
Tactical Gameplay: Counter-Strike: Source's focus on strategic, team-based gameplay is unparalleled. The need for communication and coordination adds a layer of depth that keeps each match feeling intense and rewarding.

Timeless Maps: Iconic maps like de_dust2 and cs_office stand the test of time. The level design strikes a perfect balance between simplicity and complexity, creating memorable battlegrounds.

Responsive Gunplay: The gunplay remains satisfyingly responsive, and the distinct characteristics of each weapon ensure a diverse and skill-centric experience.

Dislikes:
Outdated Graphics: While the core gameplay remains solid, the graphics are starting to show their age. An updated visual overhaul could breathe new life into this classic.

Limited Weapon Variety: Although the weapon selection is solid, a bit more variety could add freshness to the gameplay, especially for long-time players.

Recommendation:
Counter-Strike: Source is a must-play for any FPS enthusiast. Its enduring popularity speaks volumes about the game's impact on the genre. If you appreciate strategic gameplay, teamwork, and the thrill of outsmarting opponents, Counter-Strike: Source is a timeless gem that still holds up today.

Indeed, the reassembly process involves only moving the pieces around and rotating them without changing their shape. However, the pieces themselves are not ""solids"" in the usual sense, but infinite scatterings of points. The reconstruction can work with as few as five pieces.

An alternative form of the theorem states that given any two ""reasonable"" solid objects (such as a small ball and a huge ball), the cut pieces of either one can be reassembled into the other. This is often stated informally as ""a pea can be chopped up and reassembled into the Sun"" and called the ""pea and the Sun paradox"".

The theorem is called a paradox because it contradicts basic geometric intuition. ""Doubling the ball"" by dividing it into parts and moving them around by rotations and translations, without any stretching, bending, or adding new points, seems to be impossible, since all these operations ought, intuitively speaking, to preserve the volume. The intuition that such operations preserve volumes is not mathematically absurd and it is even included in the formal definition of volumes. However, this is not applicable here because in this case it is impossible to define the volumes of the considered subsets. Reassembling them reproduces a set that has a volume, which happens to be different from the volume at the start.

Unlike most theorems in geometry, the mathematical proof of this result depends on the choice of axioms for set theory in a critical way. It can be proven using the axiom of choice, which allows for the construction of non-measurable sets, i.e., collections of points that do not have a volume in the ordinary sense, and whose construction requires an uncountable number of choices.",1704242847,1704242847,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

When holding snowman with your whole team with a bunch of p90s was all you needed to have a laugh with everyone on the server.

Then this weird game called CS: GO came out. No giant fun servers, matchmaking full of hackers, gamba addicts frothing over skins and cases, people who don't understand what diggity on inferno is....

Call me a boomer man, but CS: GO just did not hit. It ushered in the age of whiny e-sports edgelords and the magic of the game disappeared. We were all terrible as fuck, but man did we have a whole lotta fun.

Melhorias Visuais e Desempenho:

Os gráficos atualizados dão um novo fôlego ao jogo sem comprometer a sensação clássica. As texturas melhoradas e os efeitos visuais mais polidos mantêm a familiaridade do mapa, ao mesmo tempo em que proporcionam uma experiência visual mais agradável e moderna.

A longevidade do jogo é notável, com uma base de jogadores fiel que garante partidas rápidas e emocionantes a qualquer momento.

Conclusão:

Counter-Strike: Source é uma homenagem perfeita ao clássico original, mantendo o seu espírito enquanto traz melhorias significativas. Com sua jogabilidade viciante, comunidade ativa e a adição de melhorias visuais, é uma experiência obrigatória para fãs de FPS e para aqueles que buscam a adrenalina das partidas multiplayer intensas.

Seja para reviver a nostalgia dos velhos tempos ou para mergulhar em um dos maiores clássicos dos jogos de tiro, Counter-Strike: Source continua a ser uma referência no gênero e uma experiência que vale a pena para qualquer jogador.

""Nenhum outro jogo consegue replicar a emoção de uma partida de Counter-Strike: Source.""",1373825634,1703547331,True,0,0,0,9,True,False,False

But, unfortunately, the game has a disadvantage, because of which there is no desire to play it. No, it's not outdated graphics, it's not the size of the maps, etc. And the community is the community that lives on every public in cs.
These people instead of giving humanely information, instead of covering their teammates (who, by the way, ask them to do so in the voice chat a million times), instead of infesting any point when necessary. People make small talk about anything: prison, girls, how they recently fuсkеd someone, how they recently got drunk, how to fight, how they bought a new car, how they served.
And it would be okay if they were just talking, so they yell and freak out when someone kills them, behave so inadequately that sometimes you want to hit their head against their monitor.
And these animals also like to rent servers, on which they pump a bunch of all kinds of flawed music from 2007, all kinds of ridiculous skins, gloves ""Adidas"" knife ""Adidas"", body armor ""Adidas"", bombs in the form of naked women, etc., parachutes, double jumps, a whole range of all sorts of abilities that break the atmosphere of the game.",1702635166,1702635187,False,1,2,0.496183186769485474,0,True,False,False

It successfully carried forward the iconic Counter-Strike gameplay while adding improved graphics and physics, enhancing the overall visual and gameplay experience.
One notable aspect that set Counter-Strike: Source apart from the original was its initial lack of popularity in the competitive ESports scene. Despite its numerous improvements, the game struggled to gain the same level of love and recognition that the original Counter-Strike enjoyed among professional players and competitive leagues. Perhaps it was the result of established players being reluctant to switch to the newer version, or maybe it took time for the competitive community to fully embrace the changes.
Despite these initial challenges, Counter-Strike: Source managed to establish a dedicated player base that kept the game alive and thriving for years. Even to this day, one can easily find servers with active players, allowing enthusiasts to continue enjoying the game's timeless appeal.
What makes Counter-Strike: Source endure is its combination of classic gameplay and updated visuals, which struck a chord with many gamers. The familiar mechanics, team-based objectives, and intense firefights remained intact, providing a sense of nostalgia while still delivering an engaging experience.
Furthermore, the improvements in graphics and physics were significant, enhancing the overall immersion and making the in-game environment more realistic and dynamic. This added a fresh layer of excitement to the gameplay, as players witnessed the impact of their actions more vividly.
Despite its earlier struggles to capture the competitive spotlight, Counter-Strike: Source's enduring player base and continued enjoyment are a testament to its lasting appeal. The game's legacy continues, standing as a worthy entry in the Counter-Strike series and a beloved title for fans of tactical shooters worldwide.",1701322055,1701322055,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

CS:GO is largely focused on comp play, CS2 has not really surfaced a casual or fully comp scene YET, but CS:S had barely had a comp scene when it first released. Due to many bugs of course! Yet, CS:S after all these years were known for having ZE, JB, DM24/7, 18+, and so many other community server types, that all have a different experience! (Most of the time.)

CS:S's casual scene Is quite prevalent within the CS community. Being know for being, err buggy, ""bad"", and a overall sour taste from launch! 1.6 at the time of Source's release, was obviously better for 1.6's updates and patches. Overtime, most of 1.6 players never even tried CS:S, just because of the 1.6 community's hate towards it. This split the community into 2, Source players, and 1.6 players. 1.6 players were mostly stuck in time with 1.6's nostalgia drug. Yet, CS:S had some things that 1.6 did not have, and in my opinion, made CS:S better than 1.6...

For example: collide-able physics props, recoil not existing for some weapons, flashlights being enabled, client sided mod support, breakable props, early source BHOPPING. The game itself on paper is not too different compared to some early/late iterations, yet the less competitive nature of it, makes for a fun, wacky experience. 1.6 did not have too much to offer, yet it was still a updated CS compared to a Day 1 CS. So, I give them credit there.

CS:S obviously has never had a big impact in the cs comp community. Just being a outsider for most of its lifetime until cs:go. However, CS:S Casual scene still has somewhat of an following, not being majorly drastic, but still alive in some standard. Community is... Chaotic tho, but it's easy to work around, and enjoy the game! Give CS:S a try; oh and valve.

They can also be fun tools for paintball games and just messing around. Even though using a smoke grenade is legal and safe, exercise caution when smoke inhalation is a risk.


Part 1	
Part 1 of 3:
Preparing Your Materials
Step 1 Gather your ingredients.
1
Gather your ingredients. To make your smoke grenade you will need a few basic ingredients first. It’s best to have your ingredients prepared before you begin to make the process easier along the way. Your ingredients are:
Granulated or cane sugar. You can get this at any supermarket, in the baking aisle.
Potassium nitrate (also known as “saltpetre”). You can get this at any home improvement store or big box store (like Home Depot, Walmart or Bunnings). If you’re not sure what to look for, ask an employee for a stump remover product.[1]
A soda can.
4 to 5 inches of cotton string, for your fuse.
Scotch tape.
A lighter or match.
Step 2 Get your supplies ready.
2
Get your supplies ready. You will also be using several tools to build your grenade. It’s a good idea to have your tools at the ready for when you need them, to make the process move faster. You will need:
Soap and water to clean your can.
A pair of scissors to cut the can in half.
A 1/4 cup measuring cup to measure out your ingredients.
A pot or frying pan to cook your ingredients in.
A towel or oven mitten to shield your hand from the heat.
A spoon, whisk, stick, or another object to mix ingredients.
A stovetop to heat and cook your ingredients on.

Step 3 Prep your ingredients.
3
Prep your ingredients. Prepping your ingredients will help each step go by more smoothly. Being prepared also avoids unnecessary running around or potential accidents in the kitchen.
Before you start mixing and cooking your ingredients, grab your soda can. Clean it out using soap and water. Then, cut it in half using your scissors.
Break up any clumps you see in the potassium nitrate powder. Run it through a sifter if you have to.
Pre-measure out your ingredients. You want to measure about 3 parts potassium nitrate for every 2 parts sugar. That’s ¾ cup of potassium nitrate and ½ cup of sugar total. You can put them in small bowls or containers for now.[2]

Part 2 of 3:
Making Your Smoke Grenade
Step 1 Place an empty pan on the stove and heat it.
1
Place an empty pan on the stove and heat it. Grab your pan and place it on a stovetop burner. Turn the stove on and heat the empty pan over low to medium heat. You’ll add ingredients once the pan is heated.[3]
Step 2 Mix your ingredients.
2
Mix your ingredients. Once the pot has heated up, it’s ready for your ingredients. Since you already have your ingredients measured, all you have to do is pour the potassium nitrate and sugar into the pot.
You can mix your ingredients before pouring them in, or pour them in individually from the presorted containers you kept them in. They don’t need to be poured into the pan in any particular order.
Mix the ingredients together as you’re pouring them into the pan, using a spoon, wire whisk, or some other mixing tool.
Step 3 Cook the mixture.
3
Cook the mixture. Keep mixing until the mixture liquefies, stirring constantly. Make sure you only mix it until it becomes liquefied. If you mix too long the mixture can thicken and catch fire.[4]
Step 4 Pour the liquid into the can.
4
Pour the liquid into the can. Cover your hand in a towel or oven mitten to protect it from the heat. Using that same hand, grab the pot and pour the liquefied solution from the pot into the bottom half of your cut can. You can hold the can with your other hand, or leave it on a flat surface while you pour the liquid into it.
Step 5 Insert the fuse.
5
Insert the fuse. Cut about 4 to 5 inches of cotton string and insert the string into the middle of the liquid, holding in place. You might have to prop the string up by setting your can next to a wall while it cools off and hardens.
Step 6 Let the liquid harden.
6
Let the liquid harden. With the top of the can still off, set the liquid aside so it can harden. This process usually takes about 6 to 8 hours at room temperature. To speed up the process you can put it in the refrigerator for about 4 to 5 hours.
Step 7 Place the top of the can onto the grenade.
7
Place the top of the can onto the grenade. Once the liquid has hardened, grab the top of the can from when you cut it off and place it back onto the grenade, securing the two pieces together with scotch tape. Weave the fuse through the top of the soda can through the mouthpiece.
Step 8 Light the grenade.
8
Light the grenade. Safely light the grenade by taking a lighter or match and lighting the end of your fuse. After several seconds (once the fuse has fully disappeared) you should see the smoke begin to release.
Toss, roll, or otherwise remove the grenade from your hand immediately after lighting it to avoid smoke inhalation.

Part 3 of 3:
Trying Variations
Step 1 Add color.
1
Add color. For colored smoke, just add some powdered (aniline) dye to your mixture. Be sure to use powdered dye, as liquid dye won’t give you vibrancy of color in the smoke. You can get aniline dye at most art or craft stores.
Step 2 Make smoke “bombs.”
2
Make smoke “bombs.” Instead of using a soda can, wait for the liquid mixture to harden a little bit and treat it like cookie dough. When it’s the consistency of cookie dough, spoon it into little balls, wrap the ball in tin foil, and stick a small fuse into the ball.
Step 3 Add baking soda.
3
Add baking soda. Add some baking soda to the mixture immediately after removing it from the stovetop. This will make your grenade burn more evenly and slowly.[5]
For this variation, you will want a ratio of 9 parts potassium nitrate for every six parts sugar for every 1-part baking soda (9:6:1).

Question
Can I use any baking soda?
Community Answer
Community Answer
Yes. This helps the smoke grenade burn longer and more evenly. But, this is optional if the grenade is only for distraction.

Question
How does the mixture become a liquid?

It's melted, like heating an ice cube. The heat from the oven melts it into a liquid.

Warnings
Don’t overcook the mixture. That can also cause it to catch fire. Only cook long enough that the mixture becomes a liquid. Once that happens, remove it from the heat source.
Helpful 23 Not Helpful 1
Even though the ingredients are all non-toxic, it’s good to avoid breathing in the smoke when you set it off.
Helpful 23 Not Helpful 3
Be careful when cutting the can it is sharp and can cut you.
Helpful 15 Not Helpful 9
Do not leave your heating mixture unattended. It can be dangerous. Your kitchen can catch fire or fill with smoke.[6]

Too much pride, between you and I not a jealous man but females lie.

Leave handprints all across you.
Good lordy wody you must be gone off that water bottle you want what you cant have oh girl that’s too damn bad

end up with two back hands.
Put anthrax on a tampax and slap you till you can’t stand.
Girl you just ruined your chance,

Its unique charm resides in its immersive maps and tactical gameplay that promotes team coordination.

When you step into the world of CSS, the remarkable blend of nostalgia mixed with adrenaline-powered action becomes undeniable. The resounding sound of the AWP, the memorable maps like Dust II, and the iconic clashes in Bomb Scenario Mode all contribute to a gaming experience drenched in reminiscence.

One unique feature of CSS is the overarching presence of the Russian community. The game has been thoroughly saturated by our Russian comrades, contributing to a diverse and vibrant multiplayer ambiance. Seamlessly switching between intellectual tactics and raw firepower, they bring a gamut of playing styles to the table, which adds to the flavor and challenges inherent in the game.

Finally, it’s the sheer fun factor that CSS brings, where rounds can turn on a dime, and tactics can be both your best friend and worst enemy. It is a game that not only stood the test of time but also proved that the core essence of fun and competitive, skill-based gameplay couldn’t be watered down. Regardless of how advanced new titles may get, Counter-Strike: Source retains a nostalgic charm that keeps pulling you back, round by round.",1700826370,1700826370,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,True,False

2、煮沸一锅水，水里放一至二汤匙盐。

3、将整只鸡放进煮开的沸水中，用文火煮10分钟左右，把鸡捞起，滴干水分，再放入沸水中再煮10分钟，把火熄了加盖10分钟捞起，待凉，切块。煮鸡时应不时翻动，以便鸡熟透。

鸡饭煮法：1、把米洗干净，至少搁半小时，饭会比较松软好吃，也比较好煮。

2、爆香蒜头，把白米炒一炒。三、把饭倒进锅里，加入适量鸡汤、盐和香兰叶，一起把饭煮熟。

辣椒酱做法：1、把辣椒，小辣椒（视各人喜好而定），去了皮的蒜头、葱头、姜切片，放进石臼里舂烂。

2、在舂好的辣椒里放入适量的盐，倒入滚烫的鸡汤，最后淋上适量酸柑汁就大功告成。

诀窍：一、鸡最好重两公斤或以上，这样的鸡才够肥，够油分，煮出来的鸡肉和鸡饭才比较香。二、煮鸡时绝不能用大火，否则皮掉肉硬，破坏“吃相”和口感。三、淋辣椒的鸡汤必须滚烫，把辣椒浇熟味道才好。四、做好的辣椒酱应当天吃完，隔夜的辣椒酱味道会比较逊色。

洒上些许芝麻油和酱油，通常佐以一碟酱油、红辣椒和一碗鸡汤 ssibal",1666024213,1700648855,False,1,1,0.496240615844726563,0,True,False,False

- Use tmp and turn to gigachad. Also works with shotgun and mp5 for unlock alternative Hunk mode. Autosniper users also have small wieners tho.

As in the original, Counter-Strike: Source pits a team of counter-terrorists against a team of terrorists in a series of rounds. Each round is won either by completing an objective (such as detonating a bomb or rescuing hostages) or by eliminating all members of the enemy team.

Counter-Strike: Source retains its team-based objective-orientated first-person shooter style gameplay. The aim of playing a map is to accomplish a map's objective: defusing the bomb, rescuing all hostages, or killing the entire opposing team. The ultimate goal of the game is to win more rounds than the opposing team. Once players are killed, they do not respawn until the next round, though this depends on which server people play on. This gameplay feature distinguishes Counter-Strike from other first-person shooter games, where players respawn instantly or after a short delay.

Shooting while moving dramatically decreases accuracy, and holding the trigger down to continuously shoot produces severe recoil. The severity of damage induced by weaponry is dependent upon the specific locations of hits, with hits to the head being most lethal and shots which make contact elsewhere causing lesser loss of health. Damage is also affected by the distance a lot, and if the target wears protection. <3",1522131539,1700613693,True,16,2,0.64531177282333374,0,True,False,False

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

EDIT:

Throughout the 2,930 hours I played in this game, I've met a lot of really cool people, said a lot of crazy shit, and seen a lot of crazy things. I used to play this 12 hours a day starting in 7th grade and ended in 11th grade summer when my first dog died, Scruffy. In 7th grade I met the coolest group of guys who gamed on this night and day with me and we founded a group (The Peckers). No matter where life takes us, I wish you all the best in your endeavors in the game of life. C, Z, D, & R....































I also used to play on a Minigames server RELIGIOUSLY on this game, it was founded by a person named Fire. I would often get told to shut up and harassed by the admins cause I was considered a ""squeaker"" or someone with a very high pitched voice. Made it to the top 10 in that server however one day I randomly got banned. Counter-Strike:Source died years later and eventually they had a Server on CS:GO or Counter-Strike: Global Offensive which died as well lol.",1313940694,1700031245,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

it also looks pretty damn good for how old it is. This is the main CS i play and i dont really have anything else to say about it. Id personally vouch for Source over 1.6, but im a bit biased as i didint grow up with 1.6 and get familiar with its gameplay.

+ responsive, fun gunplay
+ huge amount of content including mods, skins, unique custom maps
+ game modes i personally find enjoyable are zombie escape, zombie survival, jail, minigames, climbs, surfs, gungames, jumps.
+ community is nowhere near toxic as it was back in the days
+ graphics and sound are still very nice, especially the clarity - it is easy to recognize enemies, screen is never cluttered
++ for me personally, there is a huge nostalgic factor, i just cant rate this game badly with the memories i have from it

- most players are veterans that already know the game pretty well so it isnt as easy to get into

My lamentable journey with Counter-Strike: Source on my utterly decrepit laptop is a heart-wrenching saga of unrelenting despair. This once-beloved classic has become a cruel reminder of my laptop's pitiable state, and it's a tale that ought to serve as a warning to all who dare tread this melancholic path.

As I booted up Counter-Strike: Source, the grim reality of my laptop's misery was undeniable. It demanded the most brutal sacrifice: the obliteration of every vestige of graphical fidelity. The outcome? A nightmarish, desolate wasteland that bore no relation to the game's past grandeur. Textures, like the fading memories of a lost love, were a fragmented and disfigured mess.

Frames per second? Anaemic and feeble, as if measured in geological eras. Aiming was a lesson in futility, a relentless exercise in despair. Smooth game-play was but a dream, forever out of reach.

In a universe where every split-second decision is crucial, I was condemned to a perpetual state of inferiority. Every engagement was a painful symphony of missed opportunities, every lost firefight a reminder of my utter powerlessness.

Loading screens? They were like a never-ending torment, each one a fresh wound to my wounded spirit. Each loading screen was a tombstone of hope, a reminder that I was tethered to a sinking ship.

In the end, Counter-Strike: Source on my beleaguered laptop was a descent into the abyss of desolation. It left me in the throes of heartache, my aspirations crushed beneath the weight of obsolescence. If you dare to follow in my footsteps, be prepared for a journey devoid of hope. Perhaps it's time to release the past, to let go of nostalgia, and to invest in a future free from the shackles of a laptop that's been forsaken by time and technology. though my craptop was unbelievably bad, it is a fun game. 10/10, maybe someday i can play cs2",1698888169,1698888169,True,1,1,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,False

I vividly remember the first time I launched Counter-Strike: Source. The improved graphics, physics, and gameplay mechanics mesmerized me. It was a leap forward from its predecessor, and I was immediately hooked.

Just like in Counter-Strike 1.6, I made lasting friendships through Counter-Strike: Source. The teamwork and camaraderie on various servers were unlike anything else. We shared strategies, triumphs, and even defeats, all while bonding over our shared passion for the game.

Those servers have gotten the most ridiculous and retarded shit a man could ever do for a 1st person-shooter game. ABSOLUTELY Ludicrous. V.I.P. system that offers free weapons and gives the player health??? WHY????? WHYYYY?????????? THAT'S LITERALMENTE CHEATING. YOU PAY REAL MONEY TO CHEAT LMAOOOOOOO, THE IRONY. And it doesn't stop there; there is also ""medic"" system where it's obvious what does it do. So let's imagine a scenario for the sake of the argument: you manage to inflict a headshot to your enemy. and the guy pussies away, uses the "" !medic "" command and there's your health replenished!!! The next thing you see is landing some hits on him and the fucker still is not dead!!! how fucking cool is that?!??! And it gets better as you are running out of ammo and the guy 1 taps you with the fucking gayk-47!! WONDERFUL!!! I sure do love plugins who DRASTICALLY affect the gameplay! I REALLY hope there is a special place in hell for the retarded sacks of shit faggots from alliedmodders website (or wherever the fucking bigass hole they came from) who came up with these ""PLUGINS"" . Now hold on to your cock before writing ""ERMMM BUT 1.6 ALSHO HASH ERM SHITTY PLUGINSH!!!"" YEAH I KNOW!! However the fucking difference being is that in 1.6 you can still find NORMAL servers where in cs source, the fucking server list is filled with this rubbish. Genuinely sick of it. People are so goddamn sassy nowadays by refusing to host VANILLA servers. I might add, there is this plugin that plays music at the end of the round but takes fucking ages for the round to move to the next one. i have a question, for the server hosts: WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY?!!!!!!!!!!??????????
WHY DO I HAVE TO WAIT 1 FUCKING MINUTE FOR THE ROUND TO START EVERYTIME ONE OF THE TEAMS FUCKING WINS??? IF I HAD WANTED TO LISTEN TO MUSIC, I WOULD'VE GONE TO YOUTUBE AND SEARCH ""Colaj manele Nicolae Guta 2008""
And If it's not a ruski server, then it's one that has 1 millions of bots in it. Why bots?? are you that fucking desperate?? What a sick joke.
Cs source servers have unfortunately gotten infected with the ""severe retardation"" virus and HOPEFULLY, HOPEFULLY, HOPEFULLY, it won't affect MY 1.6 !!!

It's a team-based multiplayer first-person shooter where two teams, terrorists and counter-terrorists, compete in various game modes. These modes include team deathmatch and attack and defend, among others, although we won't delve into the community-created modes in this review.

In team deathmatch, it's a straightforward team-versus-team battle where players don't respawn until the next round, enhancing the game's tactical nature. In attack and defend, terrorists aim to plant explosives in designated areas, while counter-terrorists strive to eliminate the terrorists before they can detonate the explosives.

Counter-Strike: Source boasts impressive graphics for its time, and they still hold up well today. The game's physics are quite realistic, particularly in the default servers. Guns have authentic recoil, and grenades can send bodies flying. Credit for this realism goes to Valve's innovative Source engine, also used in the acclaimed Half-Life 2.

The gameplay is on par with the graphics, offering fluid movement and easy aiming. Each gun has its unique sound and feel, making the experience distinct. Maps are designed to keep players engaged, ensuring you don't wander too long without encountering an opponent, enhancing the game's immersion.

The game's real charm, however, lies in its community. As is typical of multiplayer games, it's the interactions with other players that provide the most fun. Unfortunately, many servers are plagued by negative experiences like rude players, racists, or even young kids with odd character skins. Nonetheless, the game compensates for this with excellent mods, superb gameplay, and reliable servers. In summary, Counter-Strike: Source is a must-play for PC gamers. Overall, it's great.

240,148305554,76561198423995079,0,8,187,0,187,1694813147,"Once upon a time, in the early days of PC gaming, a small group of modders had a crazy idea. They believed in a world where terrorists and counter-terrorists could engage in a battle of wits, reflexes, and all the gunfire you could handle, without leaving the safety of your desk chair. And so, in the late '90s, they gave birth to a phenomenon we now know as Counter-Strike.

The game was, in a way, like your grandma's famous stew - a little bit of this, a dash of that, and a whole lot of secret sauce. It was pure magic, wrapped in pixelated graphics and the occasional ""I can't believe you just shot me!"" rage. But it was love at first sight for many. You could choose to be a terrorist or a counter-terrorist, wielding all sorts of weapons and striving to complete objectives or eliminate the enemy team.

As the years went by, Counter-Strike evolved, much like your teenage years - it got a little smarter, a bit more mature, and much better at killing terrorists and defusing bombs. There were new maps, new weapons, and, of course, endless arguments about which gun was the best (spoiler: it was always the AWP). It was a mix of strategy, teamwork, and, well, a fair amount of camping in dark corners.

But it was in 2012 when things got a bit more ""Global."" Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, or CS:GO, burst onto the scene. It was like Counter-Strike had put on a fancy suit, polished its shoes, and gotten a promotion. CS:GO brought better graphics, improved gameplay mechanics, and more matchmaking options. The esports scene exploded, turning the game into a major league of its own. It was like the Super Bowl for gamers, but with fewer commercials and more headshots.

Yet, as time went on, CS:GO started showing its age, like that old sitcom you used to binge-watch in your pajamas. Fans clamored for something new, something fresh, something with a ""2"" at the end of it. And Valve, the brilliant minds behind Counter-Strike, heard their pleas. Thus, Counter-Strike 2 was born.

The sequel took everything we loved about CS:GO, sprinkled in some futuristic tech, and voilà! It was as if the old dog had learned some new tricks. The graphics were out of this world, and the gameplay was smoother than a jazz solo. But, at its core, it remained the Counter-Strike we all knew and loved.

With the release of Counter-Strike 2, CS:GO was officially retired, a hero riding into the sunset, leaving behind an indelible legacy in the gaming world. It was a bittersweet moment for fans, like saying goodbye to an old friend. But as they loaded up Counter-Strike 2 and heard that familiar ""dun dun dun dun"" of the menu music, they knew the journey was far from over. Counter-Strike was here to stay, evolving and adapting, just like the gamers who loved it.

So, whether you're a seasoned veteran or a fresh-faced recruit in the world of Counter-Strike, remember that this game isn't just about shooting terrorists and defusing bombs. It's about friendships forged in the heat of battle, memories made in the dust of de_dust2, and countless hours spent wondering why the guy on your team insists on buying a Negev every round. Here's to Counter-Strike, past, present, and future - a game that keeps on giving, just like a good stew recipe that's passed down through the generations.

If you're going to play with friends this is the best one you could pick, but if you're looking to play seriously or competitively it's honestly pretty awful at that. It has the best modding system of any of the games and you can install just about anything and use it on a server akin to TF2 or L4D2. The community around it is also a lot more laid back and casual.

I wouldn't ever go as far as to outright say CSS is bad, it's not. But there's a reason fans weren't that keen on it as a (supposed) remake of 1.6.

Do you remember that very first time when you went to school and cried on the line, because your mother was not next to you and you were very scared? And when your parents signed you up for football, which you hated with every cell of your body, and all just because a strict grandfather did not allow your father to play sports as a child, and now the latter wants to fulfill his own failed dream at your expense?When I tried cheap burnt vodka with the Kents for the first time at school and you vomited for the rest of the evening and you cried and burped your face into the ground and shouted: “Mom, I don’t want to die,” I definitely haven’t forgotten it. When for the first time, at a friend’s appointment, you got hooked with that same uptight, melancholy friend, and she became your first failed love. When you're at the 5th hour of the Lord of the Rings marathon with your new girlfriend, you've gone very far and it was your first time. Graduation from school and admission to university.Master's degree and first well-paid job. Everything that happened in your life...
There is so much time and completely different events, and they all have only one thing in common - this is GAME.
What did you do every evening after school? I watched guides and learned to play. When you quarreled with your father over throwing football, where did you hide from depressive thoughts? When you broke up with that same friend who cut her wrists over breaking up with you,who helped you out and gave you such necessary advice and helped you sort out your own thoughts? The same 30-year-old loser drinking with whom you played parties, who constantly joked that he would be your new stepfather.Life beat you from time to time without a chance for respite, and in moments when you thought that you would not get a diploma and would die of hunger because at the age of 20 you cannot find a way to feed yourself. You always turned to a new batch of young dead-siders, playing with whom depressed you in the moment, but at a distance helped you to distance yourself from your own failures and failures in life, gather your strength, and move on along the winding road called Life.A lot on your path, grief and happiness, everything is tied to an ordinary computer game, which most often gives you only negativity, and yet it always remains at hand to help you get out of the pile of shit into which existence sometimes plunges us. The best game, with a terrible community and stupid developers, but never refuses to help you and gives you so many emotions.

Counter-Strike: Source, released in 2004 by Valve Corporation, stands as a pivotal entry in the iconic Counter-Strike franchise. This game marked a significant shift in the series, transitioning from its original mod roots to a full-fledged standalone title. Counter-Strike: Source managed to bring the classic gameplay of Counter-Strike into the modern era with updated graphics and physics, making it a noteworthy chapter in the franchise's history.

One of the most apparent improvements in Counter-Strike: Source was the visual overhaul. The game made a leap forward with its use of Valve's Source engine, resulting in improved graphics, physics, and ragdoll effects. The upgraded visuals breathed new life into familiar maps, creating a more immersive and visually appealing experience while still retaining the essence of classic Counter-Strike gameplay.

The core gameplay of Counter-Strike remained largely unchanged, preserving the tactical, team-based action that fans had come to love. Players could still choose between terrorists and counter-terrorists, each with their unique weapons and objectives. This familiar formula, rooted in strategy and teamwork, remained as addictive as ever.

Counter-Strike: Source also introduced minor gameplay adjustments, including tweaks to weapon balancing and recoil. These changes added a layer of depth to gunplay, ensuring that player skill and precision were paramount, while also allowing for subtle nuances in weapon handling.

Modding support and custom content played a significant role in the game's longevity. The Steam Workshop integration allowed players to create and share custom maps, skins, and game modes, ensuring a steady stream of fresh content and gameplay variety. This robust community engagement extended the game's lifespan well beyond its initial release.

Despite its many merits, Counter-Strike: Source did face some criticism, primarily related to performance optimization and the transition from the original Counter-Strike. Some players found that the updated graphics came at the cost of reduced performance on older hardware, though this was partially mitigated through subsequent updates.

In conclusion, Counter-Strike: Source successfully modernized the iconic Counter-Strike experience while retaining the core gameplay mechanics that made the franchise a phenomenon. The visual upgrades, gameplay adjustments, and continued community support ensured its enduring popularity among fans of the series. While it may not have completely replaced its predecessor, Counter-Strike: Source carved out its place in the hearts of gamers as a classic reimagined for a new era of online multiplayer shooters.",1696706502,1696706502,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Title: Counter-Strike: Source - A Masterclass in Milking the Cow

INT. VALVE HQ - DAY

A writer and a producer sit across from each other. The writer is wearing a Counter-Strike t-shirt, while the producer has a dollar sign pendant hanging from his neck.

PRODUCER
(leaning back)
Alright, hit me with the pitch for Counter-Strike: Source!

WRITER
(excited)
So, we take Counter-Strike, right? The beloved classic shooter?

PRODUCER
(raising an eyebrow)
Go on...

WRITER
And we give it a ""refreshing"" update by... not really changing anything at all. We just update the graphics a bit.

PRODUCER
(nods)
I like where you're going with this. Minimal effort, maximum profit!

WRITER
Exactly! And then, we shut down Counter-Strike: Global Offensive many years later, just like Activision Blizzard did with Overwatch 1. But instead of a true sequel, we force everyone to play ""Counter-Strike 2 instead."" It's practically the same game, but we'll market it like it's a revelation.

PRODUCER
(laughs)
Genius! Let's call it an ""enhanced experience"" or something. We're totally not pulling an Activision Blizzard here!

WRITER
(chuckles)
Oh, and here's the best part. We'll add more microtransactions, just like we did with Team Fortress 2 and Dota 2. We'll create a premium matchmaking service and find new and creative ways to exploit players financially. Who cares about gameplay? It's all about the cash, baby!

PRODUCER
(grinning)
I love it! We'll milk those whales for all they're worth!

CUT TO:

INT. GAMING CONVENTION - DAY

The Counter-Strike: GO booth is packed with excited fans. The writer and producer stand proudly in front of it.

WRITER
(excitedly)
And there you have it, Counter-Strike 2 ! It's the same game you love, with a fresh coat of paint and a hefty amount of microtransactions!

PRODUCER
(whispering to writer)
Remember, it's not a scam. It's an ""enhanced experience.""

The fans cheer and line up to empty their wallets.

CUT TO:

INT. HOLLYWOOD OFFICE - DAY

The writer and producer celebrate their success with champagne.

WRITER
(raising a glass)
To capitalism!

PRODUCER
(laughs)
To capitalism!

FADE OUT:

INT. GAMING CONVENTION - DAY

As the fans continue to pour money into Counter-Strike: Source, a banner above the booth changes to display ""Capitalists Win.""

And there you have it, folks. Counter-Strike 2, where the only thing more explosive than the in-game bombs is the relentless pursuit of profit. Remember, when you play Counter-Strike 2, it's not about the terrorists or the counter-terrorists – it's about the capitalists winning big!

Remember that very first time you went to school and cried at the assembly because your mom wasn't there and you were very scared? Or when your parents signed you up for soccer, which you hated with every fiber of your being, just because your strict grandfather didn't let your dad play sports as a child, and now the latter wants to fulfill his own failed dream through you? When you and your friends tried cheap bootleg vodka behind the school for the first time and you spent the rest of the evening vomiting and crying, saying ""mom, I don't want to die,"" you definitely haven't forgotten that. When you hooked up with that repressed melancholic girl at a friend's party for the first time, and she became your first failed love. When you went very far with your new girlfriend during a 5-hour Lord of the Rings marathon, and it was your first time. Graduating from high school and entering university. Master's degree and first well-paid job. Everything that was in your life... 

So much time and completely different events, and they are all united by only one thing - it is GAME. 

What did you do every evening after school? Watched guides and learned to play. When you quarreled with your dad over the abandoned soccer ball, where did you hide from depressive thoughts? When you broke up with that same girlfriend who cut her veins because of the breakup with you, who helped you and gave such necessary advice and helped you sort out your own thoughts? That same 30-year-old loser with whom you played party games, who constantly joked that he would be your new stepfather. Life hit you time after time without a chance to rest, and in moments when you thought that you would not get a diploma and die of hunger because at the age of 20 you cannot find a way to feed yourself. You always turned to a new batch of underage insider players, playing with whom oppressed you at the moment, but in the long run helped you distance yourself from your own failures and setbacks in life, gather strength, and move on along the winding road called Life. 

So much on your way, sorrow and happiness, everything is tied to an ordinary computer game, which most often gives you only negative emotions, and nevertheless always remains at hand to help you get out of the pile of crap into which existence sometimes plunges us. The best game, with a terrible community and stupid developers, but never refusing to help you and giving you so many emotions.

What this game lacks in graphics, it makes up for in gameplay. In fact, this can be said about the majority of Valve's earlier games.

The only downside is the difficulty of the bots. The bots sometimes seem like they're on Hard Difficulty, even though they're on Normal Difficulty. It primarily feels this way because of the reaction time of the bots - they just feel too buffed.

The achievements also seem rather ridiculous. In order to get the majority of the achievements, especially the weapons achievements, you must do extremely tedious tasks in a repetitive fashion over and over again, to a point unprecedented in the art of getting achievements. Thus, this is what makes getting achievements in this game very difficult.

if you want to play in community servers with the same few people who get on every night at the same time, source is also a good place.

if you want to play competitively, source is not a good home for you. 

the reason this game is still alive is because it's the silliest of all the CS games- and that's what you'll get in most servers. silliness. silly movement, random sprays, crazy weird server plugins, creative maps and game modes- and a few dedicated people who will play them forever. that's what I love about source, and it's great to be able to go back to something familiar and see it hasn't much changed.

Sadly the Deathrun, Surf and Minigame servers are dead...was fun playing with friends and a lot of random players.
Purchased because for fun nothing else, bored of CS:GO with the cheaters.
As checked CS:Sourse have a lot of fake servers with bots and cannot be joined... there are a bit of community servers with real players, which are mostly Russians.
Really sad that the game seems a bit I mean a bit dead, but is still fun to play.
We need to bring back Deathrun, Surf and Minigame server mods again, not only playing to tryhard like CS:GO competitive mode.
Also I checked the community servers in CS:GO, the Deathrun servers are missing, they are completely dead... which makes me really sad about this.",1695683165,1695683165,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My son got this game immediately after release. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

The aim of playing a map is to accomplish a map's objective: defusing the bomb, rescuing all hostages, or killing the entire opposing team. The ultimate goal of the game is to win more rounds than the opposing team. Once players are killed, they do not respawn until the next round, though this depends on which server people play on. This gameplay feature distinguishes Counter-Strike from other first-person shooter games, where players respawn instantly or after a short delay.
Shooting while moving dramatically decreases accuracy, and holding the trigger down to continuously shoot produces severe recoil. The severity of damage induced by weaponry is dependent upon the specific locations of hits, with hits to the head being most lethal and shots which make contact elsewhere causing lesser loss of health. Damage is also affected by the distance, and if the target wears protection.
Counter-Strike: Source was initially released as a beta to members of the Valve Cyber Café Program on August 11, 2004. On August 18, 2004, the beta was released to owners of Counter-Strike: Condition Zero as well as those who had received a Half-Life 2 voucher bundled with some ATI Radeon video cards. The game was included with Half-Life 2 bundles, which were released on November 16, 2004.

On October 11, 2006, Valve released an experimental update entitled Dynamic Weapons Pricing. Under this system, item prices are determined based on their demand the previous week.[8][9][10]

On March 5, 2010, Valve announced the release of games from its first-party library, including games from the Counter-Strike series, for Mac OS X. The ports were slated for release in April 2010. Valve employed Hidden Path Entertainment to provide support on updating Counter-Strike: Source. On May 7, 2010, Valve released an update that includes new features and functionality developed in collaboration with Hidden Path Entertainment. These include 144 (now 146) new achievements, a new domination and revenge system, similar to that of Team Fortress 2, player stats, an upgrade to the Source engine and more. On June 23, 2010, Valve released the beta to the public alongside the promised OS X version. On February 5, 2013, Valve released a port of Counter-Strike: Source for Linux.",1679010669,1695076631,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

- Game is much easier with better Hitboxes, better Maps and Controls

- Better Graphics and nice Physics, and of course being able to shoot through Walls and Wood and actually killing someone

- Enough Money for actual Equipment

- No real Cheaters/toxic Players. Everybody wants some fun :)

- Source is better then Gold Source, giving CS an still pretty advanced Engine and stable Online Play (never had a lagging Game)

- An more active Playerbase (not really a lot of Players in OG CS)

Negatives:

- Most of the Servers are Custom and so are mostly Team Deathmatch

- Cant add how many Bots I want to have when creating a Server (if you know why and how to fix it write in under this Review in the Comments)

- Germans are still annoying about small things (I am German myself)

- Premium Players on custom Servers who die slow

The emphasis on teamwork, precise shooting, and strategic planning shines through in every match. The balance between the two opposing sides – terrorists and counter-terrorists – along with the focus on objectives keeps the gameplay consistently captivating.

The visual upgrade to the Source engine breathes new life into the game. While retaining the iconic maps and gameplay mechanics, the enhanced graphics elevate the experience, offering improved textures, lighting effects, and overall visual fidelity. It's a treat to see classic maps like Dust and Inferno reimagined with a fresh coat of paint.

The tight gunplay and weapon variety that Counter-Strike is known for are still present in Source. Each weapon has a distinct feel, encouraging players to experiment and find the arsenal that suits their playstyle best. The recoil patterns and gun mechanics maintain their authenticity, rewarding players who dedicate time to mastering these nuances.

What's particularly enjoyable about Counter-Strike: Source is its accessibility. The game runs well on a variety of hardware, making it easy for both veterans and newcomers to jump in and enjoy the action. The intuitive controls and straightforward mechanics ensure that you can focus on the thrill of the battle without getting bogged down in complex systems.

Additionally, the modding community for Source continues to thrive. The game's longevity is a testament to the dedicated fan base that creates and shares custom maps, skins, and game modes. This extends the life of the game, offering new experiences and challenges beyond the base content.

Counter-Strike: Source strikes a perfect balance between preserving the classic shooter experience while embracing modern enhancements. Its timeless gameplay, enhanced visuals, and active modding scene ensure that this title remains a cherished gem in the hearts of both old-school Counter-Strike fans and new players alike.",1511701330,1694763956,True,12,0,0.645323455333709717,0,True,False,False

I have always struggled to connect with my son as he spends most of his free time playing games online or watching others play on YouTube. As a busy single father, I found it difficult to spend quality time with him.

But recently, my son introduced me to a game called Counter-Strike: Source, and I decided to create a Steam account so we could play together. It had been decades since I last played a video game, so I was quite rusty. But my son patiently taught me how to play and we started bonding over this game.

I was pleasantly surprised by how much fun we had playing together. It was like we were solving a mystery together, laughing and having a great time. Playing video games with my son reminded me of the joy of being a kid and it helped me to connect with my son on a whole new level. We even started spending more time together outside of the game, going on walks and enjoying other activities.

As a single father, it can be difficult to find common ground with my son, but video games have given us a new way to bond and spend quality time together.

At the heart of Counter-Strike: Source lies its captivating gameplay mechanics. The precision and responsiveness of gunplay reward players for honing their skills, while the fluid movement mechanics ensure adrenaline-pumping firefights that keep you on the edge of your seat. The satisfaction of landing that perfectly timed headshot or making a clutch play is addictively gratifying, urging players to push their limits and elevate their gameplay.

The allure of Counter-Strike: Source doesn't stop with its gameplay; it lies in the richness of its map design. Each map presents a unique challenge and a host of strategic opportunities for both Counter-Terrorists and Terrorists. From navigating the narrow corridors of Dust2 to the open battlegrounds of Aztec, every environment demands teamwork, communication, and tactical finesse.

With a seamless blend of tactical gameplay, strategic team dynamics, and adrenaline-pumping action, Counter-Strike: Source has managed to retain its charm and popularity over the years.

The core gameplay of Counter-Strike: Source remains true to its origins, offering a balanced and competitive experience that rewards skill, communication, and teamwork. Players must choose between the Counter-Terrorist and Terrorist factions, each with distinct objectives and weaponry. The tactical gameplay encourages coordination and map knowledge, making each match a unique and thrilling challenge.

One of the standout features of Counter-Strike: Source is its exceptional gunplay. The gun mechanics feel satisfyingly realistic, with each weapon having its own distinct handling and recoil patterns. Mastering the nuances of different firearms adds depth to the gameplay, rewarding players who put time into honing their shooting skills.

The graphics of Counter-Strike: Source, while outdated compared to modern titles, still hold up well and contribute to the game's overall charm. The maps are well-designed and offer a good balance of open spaces and tight corridors, allowing for diverse strategies and tactics.

Furthermore, the game benefits from an active community that continues to create new maps, mods, and custom content, ensuring that there is always something fresh to experience. The plethora of game modes, including classic bomb defusal and hostage rescue, as well as creative custom modes, provides hours of entertainment and replay value.

However, one aspect that may deter some players is the steep learning curve. Newcomers to Counter-Strike: Source may initially find it challenging to compete against experienced veterans. Yet, once players acclimate to the game's mechanics and map layouts, the sense of accomplishment in landing that perfect headshot or pulling off a well-coordinated team strategy is immensely rewarding.

Overall, Counter-Strike: Source remains a quintessential FPS that has aged gracefully. Its engaging gameplay, robust gun mechanics, and active community make it a timeless classic that continues to captivate gamers around the world. Whether you're a seasoned veteran or a newcomer looking for an authentic and intense shooting experience, Counter-Strike: Source is a game that should be in every FPS enthusiast's library.",1640966580,1691228829,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Welcome, fellow gamers! Today, we embark on a thrilling journey through Counter-Strike: Source (CS:S), as seen through the eyes of Kiba Snowpaw, an arctic aficionado and seasoned gamer. Join us as we explore the highs and lows of this icy battleground and discover the unique charm it holds.

[h1] A Memorable Journey[/h1] 

CS:S is a game that captivates the mind and immerses players in intense firefights and dramatic moments. Kiba Snowpaw, our guide in this review, fondly recalls the excitement he felt when the game first rolled out. With his claws dancing over the keyboard, he eagerly welcomed the exhilarating challenge and the possibilities it offered. CS:S proved to be more than just a game; it brought together a furry community, reminiscent of the fierce competition seen in ""King of the Hill"" matches.

[h1] A Blizzard of Change[/h1] 

But, as with any journey, there are obstacles to overcome. Kiba describes a UI change introduced around the release of Team Fortress 2, which, like a chilling blizzard, disrupted the gameplay experience he had come to love. However, despite this setback, Kiba asserts that CS:S still triumphs over its successor, CS:GO.

[h1] Quenching the Thirst for Hunt[/h1] 

For the wolf within Kiba, the gungame mode in CS:S is a feast for the senses. The thrill of progressively becoming stronger with each victory ignites the same joy as a successful hunt beneath the dancing auroras of his icy world. Unfortunately, persistent server delays act as harsh winter storms, disrupting the harmony of the gameplay and slowing down the fast-paced action.

[h1] Finding Beauty in the Snow-Covered Flaws[/h1] 

Kiba reminds us that critical reviews are not about nitpicking faults, but rather about appreciating the inherent beauty that lies beneath them. Despite its imperfections, CS:S holds a special place in Kiba's heart, acting as a loyal companion during countless sleepless nights. It is a game that has provided a valuable escape during dark times, gifted to Kiba by his late grandfather. The warmth of this memory shines like the radiant glow of the northern lights, forever illuminating his gaming experience.

[h1] Remembering the Fallen[/h1] 

Kiba reflects on a dear friend he met in the CS:S universe—a friend whose struggles in real life found solace and purpose on the virtual battlefield. Although no longer with us, the spirit of this friend lives on within the game, echoing like a lone wolf's howl through the icy valleys. Their memory serves as a poignant reminder of the power of gaming to connect and inspire, even in the face of adversity.

[h1] A Path Forward [/h1] 

In an ideal world, Kiba envisions a game free from server delays, where he can once again feel as swift as a wolf returning to the pack. Despite the UI change and other flaws, Counter-Strike: Source remains a cherished and beloved game for Kiba. He yearns for the day when he can fully immerse himself in the gungame mode without disruptions, like a contented wolf basking under a clear, starry sky.

[h1] The Eternal Charm [/h1] 

In conclusion, Counter-Strike: Source stands as an enduring testament to the power of gaming. Its charm, akin to an old gnarled tree in a frostbitten homeland, withstands the test of time, offering shelter and warmth amidst the icy winds of change. By experiencing CS:S through the eyes of Kiba Snowpaw, we see the magic and lasting impact that games can have on our lives.

Thank you for joining us on this journey through Counter-Strike: Source. Stay gaming, stay frosty, and may your battles be as engaging as the icy regions from which Kiba Snowpaw hails.

Having played countless hours since its release, I can confidently say that it remains one of the most exhilarating and enjoyable multiplayer experiences out there.

One of the first things that struck me about Counter-Strike: Source is its simplicity and accessibility. Even newcomers to the FPS genre can quickly get into the action, thanks to the intuitive gameplay mechanics. Yet, beneath the surface lies a depth that keeps players coming back for more. The gunplay is satisfying and precise, and mastering the various weapons becomes a rewarding journey in itself.

The game's graphics, though not the most cutting-edge by today's standards, have a unique charm that has aged surprisingly well. The maps are well-designed and offer a perfect balance between close-quarters combat and long-range engagements. Whether it's sneaking through the shadows or going in guns blazing, each round is a thrill, and no two matches are ever quite the same.

Moreover, the community surrounding Counter-Strike: Source is second to none. The game has fostered a passionate and dedicated player base, and finding a match is never a struggle. The camaraderie and teamwork required in each game create an immersive experience that fosters a sense of belonging among players.

Another aspect that keeps me hooked on Counter-Strike: Source is the endless opportunities for improvement. The game rewards practice, strategy, and coordination, which leads to a sense of personal growth with every match. As I continue to hone my skills, each successful kill or well-executed tactic fills me with a genuine sense of achievement.

Furthermore, the longevity of Counter-Strike: Source can be attributed to its active modding community. The countless user-created maps, skins, and game modes keep the experience fresh and exciting. Whether I'm indulging in a nostalgic throwback or diving into a creative and new community-driven experience, the possibilities seem boundless.

Lastly, the support from the developers over the years has been commendable. Despite being an older title, Counter-Strike: Source has continued to receive updates and patches, ensuring that the game remains relevant and enjoyable for both veterans and newcomers alike.

In conclusion, Counter-Strike: Source is an undeniable classic that continues to shine in the competitive multiplayer genre. Its addictive gameplay, supportive community, and timeless appeal make it a must-play for any gaming enthusiast. Whether you're a seasoned veteran or new to the world of first-person shooters, this game is an absolute blast that guarantees countless hours of fun and excitement.",1690218020,1690218020,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Considerably worse graphics than CS:GO.
No crosshair outline - so you can't have, say, white crosshair with black outline that will be visible on all backgrounds.
Viewmodels have only one version of hands and it doesn't match the third person model. Really breaks the immersion.
USE key in buy zone doesn't open the BUY menu.
Buy menu is not radial - makes it exceptionally difficult to use with mouse.
You can't pick up weapons with USE key.
KRIEG 552 and BULLPUP don't aim down the sights.

1- Its give you nostalgia and run in a potato with 1,6 volts.
2- If you play garry's mod you need this to play without missing textures or errors.
3- You can play alone or multiplayer.
4- So much guns.
5- If you play valorant you will like this because its like valorant.
6- Amount of achievements to get
7- Nostalgia maps like cs_assault and cs_italy (my favorites are cs_italy cs_assault and cs_office).
8- Its hard to play with friends. you need to find the same server. (negative point).

And if you are questing yourself: So... I buy the game?
                                                      R: Of course!

Conclusion: The community keeps making new maps so there's constant content to enjoy and learn. Players can also customize their weapon models using websites like gamebanana. Global Offensive has better graphic but CSS is more user friendly and smooth to play. There's no ranking or levels in this mode (server VIP only gains access to skins and customizable items), so no worry about having a long way to catch up, everybody is equal. If it's your 1st time playing, just hold W (weather you are a human or a zombie), and follow your team, you will get your hands on this mode very quickly.",1559444970,1688694318,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As a modernized version of the original Counter-Strike, this title successfully revitalizes the iconic gameplay and intense tactical battles that have defined the series. With its strategic depth, tight gunplay, and dedicated community, Counter-Strike: Source remains a staple in the competitive gaming scene.

One of the standout features of Counter-Strike: Source is its emphasis on teamwork and strategic gameplay. Each round pits terrorists against counter-terrorists, challenging players to coordinate their efforts, communicate effectively, and execute well-thought-out strategies. The game rewards players who master map knowledge, positioning, and weapon handling, promoting a highly skill-based experience.

The gunplay in Counter-Strike: Source is tight and satisfying. The weapons have a distinct feel and impact, requiring precision and control to land accurate shots. The game's recoil mechanics add an extra layer of challenge, as mastering the spray patterns of each weapon becomes crucial for success. The sense of achievement that comes from landing that perfect headshot or clutching a round is unmatched.

Visually, Counter-Strike: Source may not match the graphical fidelity of more recent titles, but it maintains a distinct and recognizable art style. The maps are well-designed, with attention to detail and varied environments that cater to different playstyles. From tight, close-quarters encounters to expansive outdoor battlegrounds, each map offers a unique setting that contributes to the game's tactical depth.

Counter-Strike: Source's longevity can be attributed to its active and dedicated community. The game boasts a vibrant multiplayer scene, with players competing in various game modes such as bomb defusal and hostage rescue. Whether you prefer casual matches or want to test your skills in competitive play, there is always a server available to suit your preferences. The community-driven mods and custom maps further enhance the game's replayability, ensuring that there's always something new to experience.

The game's accessibility is another positive aspect. Counter-Strike: Source can run on a wide range of systems, making it accessible to a broad audience. Its relatively low system requirements allow for smooth performance even on older hardware, ensuring that players can enjoy the game without technical limitations.

However, it's important to note that Counter-Strike: Source's player base has decreased over time as newer entries in the series have gained popularity. This can result in longer matchmaking times and a smaller pool of active players, particularly in less popular game modes. Nevertheless, the dedicated community and active servers continue to provide an engaging multiplayer experience.

In conclusion, Counter-Strike: Source stands as a testament to the timeless appeal of tactical first-person shooters. Its focus on teamwork, strategic depth, and skill-based gunplay have solidified its place as a classic in the gaming world. While the game may not boast the same level of graphical prowess as newer titles, its engaging gameplay and dedicated community make it a must-play for fans of competitive shooters. Counter-Strike: Source remains an essential entry in the Counter-Strike franchise, showcasing the roots of the series and providing countless hours of thrilling and strategic gameplay.",1685653845,1688614105,True,2,0,0.51776653528213501,0,True,False,False

csgo 7/10 really fast but the problem is that you cant spray without learning some extra steps
cs source 10/10 really arcade-y and also you can spray all you want
-servers
csgo 8/10 puts me in high ping servers like just put me in england servers and ill get 100 instead of 170
cs source 10/10 you can choose your own servers you wanna be in, also the servers can be modified so you can have ranks and stuff
-optimization
csgo 4/10 im on lowest settings and i barely get 60 on mirage (i even tried post-launch commands)
cs source 10/10 same engine even better physics and i get 150 fps on highest settings
-overall
csgo gets a 6/10
cs source gets a 10/10 for being the best counter strike
but like how tf is a 2004 game better than a 2012 game which is being updated to this day",1688289020,1688289020,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I truly feel like there is no other game like Counter Strike: Source. The game is smooth, the graphics are impeccable and should be considered the gold standard for any FPS. The game mechanics are essentially flawless; the hit-boxes are so crisp that you can practically feel every piece of shrapnel that impales your opponents. Counter-Strike: Source has one of the best communities around and there is never any toxicity - out of all my hours I have only been met with praise, love, and respect. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this game, before Counter Strike: Source I was small, feeble, and on the wrong path in life. After Counter Strike: Source I am large, strong, and teaching others how to succeed in life by example.

My skills are unmatched, my reflexes honed to perfection. Every click of my mouse sends waves of despair through the hearts of mere noobs. They tremble in fear as I single-handedly decimate their feeble attempts at resistance.

I dance through the maps with unparalleled finesse, striking fear into the hearts of my enemies. The headshots rain like a merciless storm, as my accuracy leaves no room for doubt. They call me a hacker, a cheat, but the truth is simple: I am a god among mere mortals, a titan of Counter-Strike supremacy.

Their cries of frustration fuel my insatiable thirst for victory. Oh, the sweet satisfaction of outplaying those hapless noobs, their futile attempts at countering my strategic genius. Their pitiful excuses fall upon deaf ears, for I am the embodiment of skill, the epitome of dominance.

So, if you dare step into the realm of Counter-Strike: Source, prepare to be humbled by my unrivaled greatness. Bow before me, noobs, for I am the one and only, the master of this virtual universe.",1686107668,1688050370,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

CS: Source is the 'official' multiplayer bundled with Half-Life 2, the online component you'll be playing long after Gordon and Alyx's adventures are over. After Counter-Strike's initial success as an amateur mod, Valve gave the team a big hug, and drew them into their studio. CS:Source is a 're-imaging' of their work, applying the marvellous technology used in Half-Life 2 to an online-only game. There's been an unwarranted level of criticism over this decision, cries of ""where's the deathmatch?"", ""this isn't new"", and ""we expected Team Fortress 2"". Dear everyone: shut up. This is a brilliant freebie, sold as part of Half-Life 2. We can assume that if you're reading this magazine, at some point you're going to buy Half-Life 2. I mean, come on. Just look at it.
The fundamentals haven't changed. Two sets of objectives exist in CS: rescue or defend a group of hostages, or bomb and defend sites of historical importance. Killing the enemy, or completing your objectives, nets you cash, to be spent on deadlier weapons, Kevlar armour and matching earmuffs, grenades, defusing kits, nightvision goggles, and every accessory for the fashion conscious 21st century digital warrior. Half-Life TV (see p142) and integrated voice-chat technology have added to the social experience. For progamers it's less a game, more a way of life.

And yet, we're having problems taking CS: Source seriously. Sorry. It's just so entertaining, full of stupidly violent shootouts, suicidal charges and tense red-wire/green-wire scenes of soldiers disarming several kiloton's worth of high-explosive. This game continually throws up the finest firefights we've ever seen in a videogame: full stop. Rescuing those hostages, planting that bomb, buying that lethal hardware all has a delicious rhythm to it, always new, always fresh. Online battles still have the capacity to surprise; players are devising new tactics for the ancient de_dust map years after its debut.

Sometimes you need to take a step back, and just watch the action unfold. Just ahead, a couple of our guys are holding the corner, stepping out, just trying to give cov... oops, make that one guy trying to give covering fire. Our sniper is crouched down, focused entirely on the corridor, waiting for the terrorists to show their faces. All I can hear are sharp, high pitched squeals, the result of one too many flash-bangs going off next to my ears. We're swimming in fog, stumbling over debris, picking our way through cadavers and discarded weapons. But just as we're about to charge to the rescue, a corpse flies through the air, arms wheeling, caught in the horrific discharge of multiple frag grenades. Then we just start giggling, and all our clever tactical planning goes to pot. Again.",1687046923,1687046923,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Serving as a successor to the original Counter-Strike, Counter-Strike: Source retains the core gameplay elements while introducing improved visuals and physics, delivering a polished and intense competitive multiplayer experience that continues to captivate players even years after its release.

Tense and Tactical Gameplay:
At its core, Counter-Strike: Source is a fast-paced, team-based shooter that emphasizes strategy, skill, and teamwork. Players are divided into two teams: the Counter-Terrorists and the Terrorists, each with their distinct objectives. The Counter-Terrorists must prevent the planting of bombs or rescue hostages, while the Terrorists aim to plant the bomb or eliminate the opposing team.

The gameplay mechanics are finely tuned, offering tight controls, realistic weapon handling, and a high skill ceiling. Each round is an adrenaline-fueled battle, where split-second decision-making, precise aim, and effective communication are vital for success. The game strikes a delicate balance between accessibility and depth, allowing both casual players and competitive enthusiasts to find enjoyment and challenge.

Map Variety and Balance:
Counter-Strike: Source boasts a diverse selection of meticulously crafted maps that cater to different gameplay styles and strategies. Whether it's the close-quarters combat of Dust II, the long-range engagements of Aztec, or the intense hostage rescue scenarios of Office, each map offers its unique challenges and opportunities.

The map design strikes a careful balance, ensuring that no single strategy or location dominates the gameplay. Every corner, doorway, and bombsite has been carefully designed to create tactical depth, encouraging players to adapt their approaches and utilize teamwork to outsmart their opponents. The well-balanced map pool ensures that matches remain engaging and unpredictable, with ample room for both individual skill and strategic coordination.

Visual and Audio Enhancements:
Counter-Strike: Source received a significant visual upgrade compared to its predecessor, thanks to the implementation of Valve's Source Engine. While it may not match the graphical fidelity of more recent titles, Counter-Strike: Source still holds up well, providing a visually pleasing experience with improved textures, lighting, and character models.

The sound design plays a crucial role in enhancing the gameplay experience. From the distinct gunfire sounds to the footsteps and callouts of teammates, the audio cues provide vital information that can mean the difference between victory and defeat. The well-crafted sound effects create a heightened sense of immersion, adding to the tension and excitement of each match.

Enduring Legacy and Active Community:
Counter-Strike: Source has established a dedicated and passionate community that continues to thrive to this day. The game's longevity is a testament to its timeless appeal, with active servers and competitive tournaments still attracting players from around the world. This active player base ensures that finding matches is quick and easy, providing an endless stream of intense multiplayer action.

Furthermore, the modding community has contributed an abundance of custom maps, game modes, and cosmetic modifications that further extend the game's replayability and customization options. Whether it's casual matches, competitive play, or community-created content, Counter-Strike: Source offers a wealth of options to suit different playstyles and preferences.

Conclusion:
Counter-Strike: Source remains a cornerstone of the first-person shooter genre, offering a polished and intense multiplayer experience that has stood the test of time. Its tight gameplay mechanics, tactical depth, and competitive nature continue to captivate players, while the visual and audio enhancements enhance the immersion. With an enduring legacy, an active community, and a wealth of customization options, Counter-Strike: Source remains a must-play title for both fans of the franchise and newcomers looking for a classic competitive shooting experience.",1686948632,1686948632,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This game has brought me more joy, frustration, and keyboard-smashing rage than any therapy session ever could. It's like a dysfunctional relationship, but instead of breaking my heart, it breaks my K/D ratio.

Let's talk about the graphics, shall we? Imagine being transported back to the early 2000s, where every character had more blocky pixels than a Lego convention. It's a visual masterpiece! Who needs realistic textures and cutting-edge technology when you can have characters that resemble cardboard cutouts on a rampage?

And the sound design, oh boy! I don't know what kind of firearms the developers were recording, but every gunshot in this game sounds like a duck with laryngitis. It's a symphony of quacks and wheezes that leaves you wondering if you accidentally stumbled into a farm rather than a battlefield.

But let's not forget the joy of teamwork in Counter-Strike: Source. It's like herding cats, except the cats have AK-47s and a knack for friendly fire. You'll witness brilliant tactical maneuvers like rushing into a bombsite without checking corners, throwing flashbangs at your teammates, and accidentally defusing the bomb while trying to reload your weapon.

Now, let's talk about the community. It's a magical place filled with colorful characters. You'll encounter the self-proclaimed ""pros"" who trash-talk their teammates while sporting a solid 0-17 kill-death ratio. And don't forget the trolls, who can turn a competitive match into a comedy show by hiding in corners and blasting ""Yakety Sax"" on their microphones.

But amidst the chaos, there's a strange addictive charm to Counter-Strike: Source. It's like a siren's call, luring you back for one more match, even if it means sacrificing your sleep, social life, and the well-being of your precious mouse button. Because nothing beats that feeling of pulling off a headshot, except maybe a surprise attack from a knife-wielding maniac who managed to sneak up on you in broad daylight.

In conclusion, Counter-Strike: Source is a game that will test your patience, reflexes, and sanity. It's a love-hate relationship that keeps you coming back for more, even when you're on a losing streak that would make Lady Luck herself chuckle. So, strap on your virtual Kevlar vest, prepare for the unexpected, and remember, no matter how many times you get wrecked, it's just a game. A game that will leave you questioning your life choices, but a game nonetheless.",1390574028,1686463280,True,3,0,0.400097846984863281,0,True,False,False

After taking charge of the project, originally a mod for Half-Life, Valve knew the original would not last forever. They produced a new version with more polished mechanics and graphics. Originally, this new iteration was controversial to professional players and other avid fans of the original, however this game is now fondly remembered for its place in FPS history.

As for gameplay, while the buy menu is clunky compared to the current menu seen in CS:GO, the memorable graphics and fluid movement are incredibly fun to mess around with. It's interesting to see the history of Counter-Strike and the way things were 20 years ago.

Introduction:
Counter-Strike: Source, released in 2004 by Valve Corporation, is the highly anticipated successor to the legendary Counter-Strike 1.6. Building upon the foundation set by its predecessor, Counter-Strike: Source delivers an updated experience with improved visuals and physics while retaining the addictive gameplay that made the franchise a global phenomenon. As a longtime fan, I'm here to share my review of Counter-Strike: Source.

Counter-Strike: Source stays true to the core gameplay mechanics that made the series so beloved. Players still engage in intense rounds as either terrorists or counter-terrorists, battling it out in objective-based scenarios. The gameplay remains fast-paced and strategic, requiring teamwork, precise aim, and tactical decision-making. While the mechanics are largely similar to Counter-Strike 1.6, Counter-Strike: Source introduces improved hit detection and enhanced physics, adding a new layer of realism to the combat.

Visual Upgrades:
One of the standout features of Counter-Strike: Source is its visual upgrades. The game utilizes Valve's Source engine, which enhances the graphics, lighting, and overall visual fidelity. The maps and character models receive a significant facelift, making them more detailed and immersive. While not as cutting-edge as modern titles, Counter-Strike: Source still holds up visually and retains its unique aesthetic charm.

Maps and Balance:
Counter-Strike: Source brings back the beloved maps from its predecessor, including Dust II, Nuke, and Inferno, while introducing some new additions. The map design remains stellar, providing a balanced gameplay experience with well-placed chokepoints, strategic paths, and opportunities for both offensive and defensive maneuvers. The maps cater to various playstyles, promoting diverse strategies and ensuring engaging encounters.

Community and Modding:
Counter-Strike: Source has a dedicated and active community that keeps the game alive and thriving. The modding scene offers a wealth of user-created content, including new maps, skins, and modifications, expanding the game's replayability and customization options. The community-driven servers and tournaments provide a vibrant and competitive environment, keeping the game fresh and enjoyable for both casual and competitive players.

Accessibility and Performance:
Counter-Strike: Source benefits from the Source engine's optimization, ensuring smooth performance even on modest hardware. The game is accessible to a wide range of players, allowing for enjoyable experiences on a variety of systems. Additionally, the intuitive interface and user-friendly controls make it easy for newcomers to jump in and start playing, while offering depth and complexity for experienced players to master.

Legacy and Influence:
Counter-Strike: Source played a significant role in shaping the future of the Counter-Strike franchise and its impact on the gaming industry. It paved the way for the subsequent installment, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, which became a dominant force in esports. Counter-Strike: Source's legacy lives on through its influence on competitive gaming and its continued popularity among fans.

Conclusion:
Counter-Strike: Source successfully builds upon the foundation of its predecessor, delivering an updated and visually enhanced experience while retaining the addictive gameplay that made the franchise iconic.

It's a game that I have spent countless hours playing, battling it out with friends and strangers alike in intense multiplayer matches. While it may have been released nearly two decades ago, Counter-Strike: Source continues to deliver an adrenaline-fueled experience that keeps me coming back for more.

The gameplay of Counter-Strike: Source is where it truly shines. The mechanics are tight and responsive, allowing for precise aiming and smooth movement. The tactical aspect of the game adds depth and strategy, forcing players to think critically about their approach to each round. Working together as a team to achieve the objectives or engaging in intense one-on-one duels creates an addictive and thrilling atmosphere.

The selection of weapons in Counter-Strike: Source is diverse and satisfying. Each firearm has its own unique feel, and mastering their intricacies is a rewarding experience. Whether you prefer the stealthy precision of a sniper rifle or the raw power of a shotgun, there is a weapon to suit every playstyle. The sound design further enhances the weapon immersion, adding weight and impact to each shot fired.

Counter-Strike: Source also boasts a wide variety of maps that offer distinct gameplay experiences. From the claustrophobic corridors of office buildings to the wide-open spaces of outdoor environments, the maps are well-designed and cater to different strategies. Learning the layouts and mastering the chokepoints is crucial for success. However, after years of playing, some maps can feel repetitive, and a fresh injection of new content would be welcomed.

The community aspect of Counter-Strike: Source is both a blessing and a curse. On one hand, the game has a dedicated and passionate player base, ensuring that there are always servers to join and opponents to challenge. However, the community can sometimes be toxic, with disrespectful and unsportsmanlike behavior. Finding a friendly and supportive group of players can make all the difference in enhancing the overall experience.

In terms of graphics and performance, Counter-Strike: Source shows its age. While the visuals may not match up to modern standards, the art style has a charm of its own. The game runs smoothly on most systems, even those with modest hardware specifications. However, occasional bugs and glitches can disrupt the gameplay, but they are infrequent and rarely detract from the overall enjoyment.

Overall, Counter-Strike: Source remains a classic and enjoyable shooter that has stood the test of time. Its engaging gameplay, diverse weapon selection, and well-designed maps continue to provide excitement and challenge. While the community can be a mixed bag, finding the right group of players can lead to unforgettable moments. For fans of competitive first-person shooters, Counter-Strike: Source is a must-play title that offers a nostalgic and thrilling experience.",1684790706,1684790706,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So I decided to create a Steam account and buy this game thinking that I might be able to play it with it. I launched the game, I finished the tutorial but I was stuck on what I should do. I asked my son if he could help me and he created a game for me to join. It was amazing, it was the best time I've had with my son since my wife died.

In my opinion it's more fun then CS:GO. This is mainly because of the ""gamemodes"" in this game. The one that I find most fun in this game is zombies. I am too lazy to explain what you do but I will just say that it is fun.

Another great thing with this game is that the textures in this game can be used in Garry's Mod for a lot of maps and addons. Before I had CSS, I would get frustrated when some maps in Garry's Mod had errors and such. But now when I have CSS I can finally play a lot of maps and use a lot of addons without errors showing up.

Little did I know that this franchise would end up becoming one of my favorite FPS franchises ever.

Rather, I want to review this game by comparing it to what everyone else is comparing it to as well, Global Offensive; because realistically, if both games follow the Counter-Strike formula, but the one with objectively better visuals is free, while this old one isn't, then why should you bother with Counter-Strike: Source? Good question!

[h1] Different community [/h1]
I purposefully didn't use the term [i] better [/i] because that is subjective. I prefer the community behind Source because it's much more casual than in GO. If however you want a competitive userbase, then of course Global Offensive is more fitting for you.

There's no Prime membership program (which in my opinion leads to gatekeeping), there's no ranking system, there isn't even a separate Ranked or Casual matchmaking mode. In this game, you just hop onto a server and play until you get bored of playing. Nobody is going to kick you for not playing good.

Of course if you're not a noob like me and can actually play well then this 'gatekeeping' issue isn't even a thing for you probably; but even in this case, it's always nice to have the option of 'taking a rest' from GO's competitiveness and hop on a more chill server. The question is, is having this option worth your money? For me, it is.

[h1] Better offline experience [/h1]
By [i] offline [/i] I mean two things: playing with bots, and playing with friends. Let's start with the first one.

[h2] Playing with bots [/h2]
In Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, if you want to play with bots, you don't really have many options to configure. Choose a gamemode, pick a map, choose the difficulty of the bots, then hit Play.

In Counter-Strike: Source, you can customize a little bit more. Let me highlight some of my favourite options.

[h3] Choose which weapon types bots can use [/h3]
Useful for example if you want to practice for pistol rounds. In this case, just deselect every weapon type except pistols.

[h3] Bots leave tasks up to players [/h3]
In Counter-Strike: GO, this option is always on and you cannot change it. It basically means that bots will always wait for you to diffuse the bomb, or that (as a terrorist) it's always you who carries the bomb, etc.

If you turn this off however, bots won't hesitate to diffuse on their own; they can also spawn with the bomb in their inventory; they will attempt to rescue hostages on their own, etc.

[h3] Bots can go rogue [/h3]
In Counter-Strike: GO, this option is always on and you cannot change it. This means that if you use voice commands to command your team ([i] Follow me [/i], or [i] Stick together [/i]), some of your teammates may answer with 'No' and just straight up ignore you. If you turn this off, all of your teammates will follow your commands, no matter what.

[h3] Voice chat activity slider [/h3]
You can adjust a slider which represents how chatty your teammates will feel while playing the game. Setting it to the max results in lots of chatter, teammates reporting their positions left-and-right, them calling for backup when they need it, etc; while setting it to a minimum does the opposite.

[h2] Playing with friends [/h2]
You can host games on LAN without Valve servers ever getting involved. Use your imagination. [spoiler] I do not support piracy in any way [/spoiler]


[h1] Modding [/h1]
Simply because this game is older than CS:GO, it has a lot more mods available to fiddle with. Yeah.

[h1] No micro-transactions [/h1]
I know lots of people don't mind the presence of micro-transactions in a game, but I do. There are no skins, no crates to purchase, nothing like that. Once you buy this game, you have access to everything it has to offer.


So yeah, these are the main reasons I prefer this game over Global Offensive despite the latter being free to play. Some of there reasons may be irrelevant to you, maybe you never want to play with bots anyway, or maybe you like the headrush that opening a crate gives you. It's really just a matter of preference. Both games are really good, but they are better for people with certain expectations and preferences.",1683457879,1683457988,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

Ingredients:

6 tablespoons unsalted butter

1/2 cup white sugar

1/2 cup brown sugar

1/4 cup water

1/4 teaspoon cinnamon

1 pinch salt

5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced

1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).

Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.

Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.

Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.

Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.

Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.

This game has everything you need to feel like a badass - guns, grenades, and a sense of superiority over your opponents.

The graphics may be a little outdated, but let's be real, who needs fancy graphics when you have a trusty AK-47? The gameplay is fast-paced and intense, and the feeling of taking down your enemy with a well-placed headshot is truly satisfying.

The game also has a fantastic community of players, who are always willing to offer helpful tips and tricks, like ""camping is a totally valid strategy"" and ""if you're not teabagging your fallen enemies, you're doing it wrong"".

But perhaps the best part of Counter-Strike: Source is the endless stream of hilarious usernames you encounter while playing. From ""TheRealSlimShady"" to ""Xx420NoScopez69xX"", you never know what kind of gem you're going to encounter next.

Overall, Counter-Strike: Source is a classic game that has stood the test of time. It's a great way to blow off some steam and feel like a tough guy, even if your mom still does your laundry.",1682739166,1682739166,True,2,0,0.502074718475341797,0,True,False,False

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore.

The game has a strong following, with a dedicated player base that still enjoys playing it to this day. However, it's important to note that the game's age is starting to show, and its time has already ended.

The graphics and sound design in Counter-Strike: Source are solid, especially considering the game's age. The gameplay is also excellent, with tight controls and fast-paced action. The game's mechanics are simple to learn but challenging to master, making it easy to pick up and play but hard to put down.

However, the game's age is starting to become a hindrance. The graphics are outdated compared to modern games, and the player base has decreased significantly over the years. This means that finding matches can be difficult, and the game's community is not as active as it once was.

Additionally, the game lacks some of the features and content that you might expect from a modern FPS game. For example, there are no progression systems, character customization, or story modes. While this might not be a deal-breaker for everyone, it's something to consider if you're used to playing more modern games.

Overall, Counter-Strike: Source is a classic game that still has a lot to offer, especially for those who are nostalgic for the early days of online gaming. However, its age is starting to show, and it's no longer as relevant as it once was. If you're looking for a modern FPS game with all the latest features and content, then you might want to look elsewhere.",1682369590,1682369590,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

240,136922689,76561199072048005,67,6,983,0,155,1694455763,"this past summer Valve brought up a very unique offer to Counter-Strike Condition Zero users, a chance to participate a beta test for a game titled called Counter-Strike: Source. At the time none of the general users really knew what it was, the source engine was known to power Half Life 2 but what did it do for Counter-Strike? Many weren't too sure if this would be a step up for the series and resisted temptation to join. As time passed previews appeared in regard to it and the true beast was revealed, this wasn't your run of the mill Counter-Strike upgrade.

What Valve had done was help renovate the entire game by upgrading the title to support new lighting effects, environment interactions such as dust coming from bullets the collided with the walls or crates. New blood effects, higher resolution levels, models and more. Basically a huge visual renovation on the whole thing that was at the time only offered to a select group of people.

 
	
 

After a bit of time and some delays the company announced something special, Counter-Strike: Source would be included as an immediately playable game for those who purchased Half Life 2 from Steam. Of course when something like this is thrown in as a freebie it's hard to resist, as a result many have converted to Counter-Strike Source and are all over the servers even right now. The addictive properties are too much for many. The new visuals and the huge servers sound like a recipie for success but one will only know if they try it out. Lets get moving so I can get shot up... or uhm.. flashbang them then unload a clip into them. Yes that's it!
 
Gameplay, Visuals, Audio

Gameplay is a huge part of the Counter-Strike series, the buy screens prior to starting each round, the physics that allow for massive team shootouts, the idea of mixing random people from around the world together and hoping everyone cooperates and so on. After taking a week with the game I came to realize that this title is in fact very much like it's little brothers. Teams are active and constantly formulating new attack methods to stop the opposition, with users coming and going out of servers every few rounds there's always the expectation for sudden domination by unknowns. The game is fueled by skill and aggressive team actions. If a single man performs a rush they don't stand a chance but if a multi angle rush is performed the opposition has less of a chance to survive if they're not securing safe spots to reload at. Also with flashbang grenades, smoke grenades and more things just get even more involving for players. Overall the experience is great still, Counter-Strike fans are slowly converting to Source as the arrival date for Half Life 2 arrives which makes for more servers and even better competition between teams.

 
	
 

 
	
 

The visual system of Counter-Strike: Source is of course amazing. The water, the smoke systems, the high resolution textures and models. These elements help drive the players deeper into the game, in a side by side comparison it's easily seen that Source drives a greater sense of realism with improved lighting, sounds, textures and collision effects. Throw in 20 Terrorists and 20 Counter Terrorists and it's a must play for any FPS fan. The game doesn't stop at just this, the game also gives players a bit of a suprise with weapons like the flashbang. Catch a short glimpse and the last image seen is partially embedded into the vision of the player until they come out of it. Get a full stare at it and I'd suggest trying to back up into a safe spot as soon as it happens as the screen blanks out entirely in a nice glow of white that returns the player to a clouded vision as it slowly wears off. Truely a great piece of work especially if the player isn't on the recieving end of it.

 
	
 

 
	
 

The audio system keeps to original Half life standards, why knock a bad design afterall? The audio reproduction varies as the player moves, instead of standard explosions to the left or right they'll appear in the ear closest to the event with a slightly lower reproduction in the opposite ear. As such players have to constantly align themselves to the location of the crossfire. If they don't then they can potentially walk into a death trap. Explosions and gunfire feature lots of variation in the game which makes for a good sense of action and of course the audio sampling has been ramped for better quaity so that Z-5500 and Promedia 5.1 users aren't left to ponder what's wrong with their systems.
 
Conclusion

In terms of network hassles, the steam software divides games up by a number of methods, players can sort the network games up by ping times, player counts, map, or game names, and by what actual game they're looking for in the case of them not playing CS:Source. Overall my experience was that there wasn't all that much network lag if players are sorting by speeds that match their connection, 56k users generally don't jump into high speed server games since they are usually kicked by the specific game admin. On average I had a ping time of about 70-80 through all of the matches I participated in. One thing I will advise for the newbies is to not download or have someone downloading on another system when playing though since it generally will slow the response of the connection down.

Just as I thought I was getting clear of addicitive titles until Half Life 2 hit, Valve comes in with this. Really I don't know what to say, the addiction has started up again and there really is nothing I can do about it. I spend every small opportunity from work to come and get a few games even if it's just 1 quick match. The Source engine really does perform wonders and with the original Half Life and Day of Defeat being upgraded one can only wonder what those titles will do to gamers.

 
	
 

 
	
 

From my observations Valve is constantly rolling out upgrades to Counter-Strike: Source to help fix minor bugs with the game, the strong support and the growing community makes this one of the prime titles to have for FPS gaming. We would like to award Counter-Strike: Source a 9/10 for lighting up that flame once again in our Counter-Strike hearts. With about 1 week left this title should be enough to drive up awareness of the Source engine and hold many players over until Half Life 2 arrives.

We would like to thank Kellie Cosner and the Valve Software staff for giving us the opportunity to check out the latest work by the company.

Counter-Strike: Source is a legendary first-person shooter that has stood the test of time, and with its modern makeover, it's better than ever! As a longtime fan of the Counter-Strike franchise, I was excited to jump back into the action and see how this updated version held up. And boy, was I not disappointed!

First things first, the graphics in Counter-Strike: Source are a significant upgrade from the original. The updated source engine brings the game to life with improved textures, lighting, and physics that create a more immersive and realistic experience. From the detailed maps to the weapon models, everything looks sleek and polished, making for an eye-catching visual feast.

But the heart and soul of Counter-Strike: Source lies in its addictive gameplay. The classic gameplay that made the original a hit is still intact - the tense rounds of terrorists versus counter-terrorists, the strategic planning with your team, the intense gunfights, and the heart-pounding moments of defusing bombs or rescuing hostages. It's all here, and it's as exhilarating as ever.

The mechanics and gunplay in Counter-Strike: Source are just as tight and precise as the original. The familiar arsenal of weapons feels satisfying to use, with realistic recoil and damage. The teamwork and coordination required to succeed in matches are still present, making for a challenging and rewarding experience. It's a game that rewards skill and strategy, and every kill feels earned.

One notable update in Counter-Strike: Source is the addition of new maps and game modes. While the classic maps from the original are still present, there are also new maps that provide fresh challenges and opportunities for tactical play. And the inclusion of new game modes, such as Gun Game and Zombie Mod, adds a fun and refreshing twist to the traditional gameplay, keeping things interesting and engaging.

The online multiplayer community in Counter-Strike: Source is thriving, with a dedicated player base that's always ready for a match. Whether you're teaming up with friends or jumping into a server with strangers, the competitive spirit and camaraderie of the Counter-Strike community are still very much alive. The game also offers support for custom mods and maps, adding even more variety and replayability to the experience.

One small downside is that the single-player mode in Counter-Strike: Source is still limited to playing against bots, which may not be as challenging or dynamic as playing against real players. However, the heart and soul of the game lie in the multiplayer experience, and that's where the real excitement and longevity of the game are.

In summary, Counter-Strike: Source is a modernized version of a classic shooter that offers a fresh coat of paint while preserving the heart and soul of the original. With its upgraded graphics, addictive gameplay, new maps and game modes, and a vibrant multiplayer community, it's a must-play for fans of the franchise and anyone looking for a fast-paced, skill-based FPS. 4.5/5 - ""A Timeless Classic with a Modern Twist!",1681283540,1681283540,True,1,0,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,False

If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

6 tablespoons unsalted butter

1/2 cup white sugar

1/2 cup brown sugar

1/4 cup water

1/4 teaspoon cinnamon

1 pinch salt

5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced

1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).

Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.

Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.

Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.

Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.

Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.

On Saturday evening, I was in with my 13 year old daughter. I ordered a steak and a drink. While the steak wasn’t very good, my server was attentive and the visit was mostly without incident. Upon settling the bill, I noticed I had been charged for an extra beverage. Not a big deal I thought, and the server explained how she made the error.
Some time passed while I waited to have the drink removed. The restaurant was busy. I looked up to see the manager in a discussion regarding the mistake on my bill. I then see that manager waiting at the bar to verify if the drink total was in fact accurate.
Now, as I mentioned at the beginning of this comment, I come in this restaurant 4-5 times a week. For seven years now. Never once have I ever been given free food, free drinks, anything free. The owner charges 39 cents if you ask for extra bread. I assure you nothing has been free. I do not expect free. I expect to be treated with respect as a customer. Finally, having waited for this simple drink to be removed from the tab long enough, I approach the bar to ask what the issue was. After verifying that the manager was in fact questioning whether I was trying to get out of paying for a drink I was served, I was livid.
This is the kind of behavior that I have written comments about before. This is behavior I have contacted corporate in the past about.
There are many other comments on this site that detail the issues at this location. While the food is generally good, the climate and atmosphere is toxic. You can feel it when you are onsite. Corporate is aware of the problems and yet sends no one to the location to investigate. But, at least they got to the bottom of that sneaky extra drink that wound up on my bill. Ridiculous!

A huge amount of the maps in use are also fan made maps, this game is mostly user made content now which is cool, it shows there's a dedicated community! This game is quite a bit of fun despite being almost a completely different game than it was on release. I play a lot of deathmatch on dust_2 and it's a good time even though I always get my ass kicked. I like playing around on the surfing maps and I'm slowly getting better at it. When I do find traditional bomb defusal or hostage rescue games they are a good time.

Graphically the game still holds up well imo, especially considering the game came out in 2004. The gun models especially still look great!

This classic title, originally released in 2004, still holds up to this day, offering an addictive and challenging gameplay experience that has kept players coming back for years.

One of the things that makes Counter-Strike: Source so great is its simple but effective gameplay mechanics. The game pits a team of terrorists against a team of counter-terrorists, with the objective of either planting or defusing a bomb, or rescuing or defending hostages. The gameplay is fast-paced, intense, and requires a great deal of skill and strategy.

One of the things that sets Counter-Strike: Source apart from other shooters is the importance of teamwork and communication. You must work together with your teammates, using different weapons and tactics to overcome the opposing team. The game rewards players who are able to work together effectively, and punishes those who try to go it alone.

Another aspect that makes Counter-Strike: Source so enjoyable is the wide range of weapons and customization options available. Players can choose from a variety of guns, each with their own unique strengths and weaknesses. You can also purchase armor, grenades, and other items to help you in battle.

The game also features a robust matchmaking system, which allows players to easily find and join games with others of a similar skill level. This ensures that each game is challenging but fair, and that players are matched up against opponents who are equally skilled.

Another aspect of Counter-Strike: Source that makes it so enjoyable is the community. The game has a dedicated following of players who have been playing for years, and who are always willing to help out newcomers. The community is also responsible for creating a wide range of custom maps, mods, and game modes, which add even more variety and replayability to the game.

In terms of graphics and sound, Counter-Strike: Source still holds up surprisingly well. While the game may not have the cutting-edge visuals of more modern titles, the graphics are still crisp and clear, and the sound effects are some of the best in the business. The game also runs smoothly on most modern hardware, meaning you can enjoy it without any performance issues.

Overall, Counter-Strike: Source is a timeless classic that still holds up to this day. With its addictive gameplay, emphasis on teamwork and communication, and wide range of customization options, it is a must-play for fans of the first-person shooter genre. Whether you are a veteran player or a newcomer, there is always something new to discover and enjoy in this timeless classic.",1680211114,1680211114,True,1,0,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,False

Multiplayer is what this game is all about. Very addicting game that requires teamwork. No one man verse all! Gaming is fast-paced with a variety of weapons and gear

Graphics are okay and dated. They are not the best but that is because it is a dated game. Lots of people still play this game.

Game modes are rescuing hostages and planting bombs and defending it. Even though those are the only two, people can really play with them a lot and not get bored out of their minds. That is because even though you play a lot of the same game map and mode, you still get a different experience each time.

And i actually like the other mods, for me i prefer zombie mod servers because the game has a much mods and the zombie mod one of this mods it's. So it seems good for me.

I really recommend this game because you never ever get bored. I've played ever since 2011or 2010 i don't rememer and it's still a great game. That's what games are all about. You always want games that will never be a one timer. You would not regret getting it! I never did.

Not to mention the skins you could import from fpsbanana where not only the gun model would change in shape, but you could have different sound. I had a deagle that sounded like a strong revolver. Was easier to hit headshots because it was more satisfying.

I don't like the new direction with source 2.

In this game, you can play as either the Counter-Terrorists (CTs), or Terrorists (Ts). Some maps will be based on a certain objective: Defuse a bomb (or plant it), or rescue hostages. Like every other Counter-Strike game, you have a ""Buy"" menu in which you can use virtual cash to buy weapons, such as pistols, shotguns, machine guns, assault rifles, snipers, and equipment like grenades and flashbangs. Alright, enough explaining. I'm going to move on to why I enjoy this game. First of all, I am a HUGE fan of the Counter-Strike series. I've put in countless hours of playing it on an old PC, but who cares if the PC is old, because it can still run great games such as this. The gameplay is excellent. The maps/environments are well-detailed, and the graphics are revolutionary for it's time. Audio quality sounds nice.
