I don't have enough time yet to really comment on the guns/bullet mechanics other than way less bugs. At this point I don't care what a games system is as long as the devs work on eliminating bugs instead of inducing more by spewing out DLCs and cosmetics no one is asking for.

*********************************************************************************************


Ok, I learnt to shoot in the military, and the only hunting I have done is with 12 ft lb air rifles in the UK. So I know a bit about shooting and hunting. I was/am a long term Hunter Classic player, and started COTW when it was new.  To me COTW was a lost opportunity to introduce aspects that Classic could not.

So, in WotH, what do you get?

Pretty graphics that run well on a mid range PC at highest settings, and audio effects that match. It is very immersive.
A good selection of rifles from .22LR to .338 Lapua Magnum with scopes, callers and binos. You start with an effective .243 and a less effective 30/30 lever action, binos and a scope. The rest of the gear is buyable with money made form harvesting kills. Ammo is free.

- proper range zeroing in 50m and 100m clicks instead of COTW's bizarre 75/150/300m cludge
- a full range of hints and aids that can be custom tuned to give you the game you want from EZ mode to hardcore
- no Huntermate as such making the game into an arcade game, it's all 'on screen'
- fascinating bullet cam once you harvest, much more intricate than COTW
- external and terminal ballistics much more realistic than COTW where the rifles have the trajectories of lasers and just punch a hole in the animal

Overall - I am enjoying this game so much more than COTW. Yes it is harder, but that makes it much more of a challenge. The developer seem keen to stay in touch with their players - their Discord channel seems to have a representative much of the time, answering questions and seeing what people feel about the game. To me, a lot of this is what COTW could have been, to get closer to simulation rather than emulation. I hope this game takes off, and they stay true to the theme of realism and simulation.

You also get a free Jeep with free fuel as soon as you pass the tutorial. This is necessary as the reserves are vast - well the Rumanian one is, I assume the Nez Perc√© one is just as big. You don't have to pay to unlock/build hunting towers - you just find them, then use them. The game has proper windage - your bullets drift with the wind strength and direction; this becomes very obvious when you start taking 600 metre shots!

Things that would make this game a true hit:

- add independent head movement; the Hunter Classic had it, COTW ballsed up by removing it and dabbling with the Tobii system.
- add support for TrackIR and Tobii. It's a pretty common thing in many FPS games and flight sims, it ads a lot of immersion instead of walking like a crab... and it did sort of work in the Hunter Classic. It might tempt anyone who went for Tobii just for COTW to defect.
- have more than three caller slots (Aug 25 2022). You can carry two rifles, and two sets of binos, so one or two more caller slots isn't unrealistic.
- start a weight based inventory mechanism so that weight does slow you down; a game where you can immediately carry two rifles with no penalties is silly.

Top tips - 

1 - do the US map first, it has a series of easy missions to build up your money
2 - do missions to build up your cash, the best buy at the start is the long range scope
3 - travel the map in the jeep straight away to  unlock campsites and lodges, and access extra missions
4 - you can buy the rights to private hunting areas, but you can also unlock them by doing tasks
5 - save your saved games every couple of days as it's not  stored on the cloud unlike most Steam games


EDIT - February 2024 patch and more

OK, so this is the fifth map, and the third of four DLC map packs promised. It's created some debate, as it's an 8km by 8km map, which is the same size as Aurora shores, but smaller than the two first maps. There are claims that the animal population may be as high as 4 x the norm, and in some areas, the animals are very often encountered. Whether this is realistic (I think not) or desirable (not to me) might differ with your own opinions. The graphics seem to not completely optimised, so foliage and bushes suddenly resolve at 50 metres distance, there are some very odd artefacts and visual bugs around water occasionally, and the distant landscape grass looks blocky and unreal.

Species - not too shabby, obviously things like feral pigs and Sambur deer are reworkings of existing models but the job is done well. Likewise feral goats and Tahr are reworkings of Mouflons etc, but look distinct and true to their species.  There are no Wallabies which are hunted as an invasive pest species, that's a shame. Along with the graphics issues, and the small map, there's ahint of corners beig cut here as creating a new body model for Wallabies seems to be beyond the resources of the development team.

Tripods - they are here after the COTW bunch kept demanding them, and I hope they are happy. You can carry 20 of them, you can erect them silently and get into one in about 10 seconds, and then you become virtually silent and invisible. I've sat in one with a crossbow, calling a herd in one by one and dropping them one by one. Want to take one down that's 6 km away - click on the map and you can dismantle it without even being near it. It then pops back into your inventory by magic.

I'll reserve judgement until the next map appears in the summer, but it's going to be another 8 x8 km map. If it doesn't offer anything but animal reskins, or it adds further highly unrealistic equipment, my respect for the game will drop a lot. 

Other stuff - well the ballistics are not all I thought they were cracked up to be. Muzzle energies are mostly correct, but energy retention and bullet drop are highly tweaked in the player's favour. The apparently complex and subtle damage model isn't quite as good as I thought it was. No matter what size/weight your animal is, it always has the same recommended hit energy parameters. Use a powerful rifle on an animal, exceed their limit, and you lose meat like crazy, even if that 'meat' is just lungs and liver... the figures are exaggerated, eg 40 kilos of meat/lungs from one .338 shot... have you any idea how much volume of lungs and flesh occupies?

They did introduce a nice FFP milrad scope but the reticle markings are wildly uncalibrated.

The callers and herd management. Once you have weeded out any low fitness animals under about 30% fitness, you're going to find that a lot of mid and high fitness animals will not respond to calls. Without Huntersense, assessing their * rating is very difficult. I've hit a bit of a wall with this aspect of the game now, and might be taking a break from it.

Overall - still the best hunting game out there but now I know it better, there's an increasing list of things not to like.",1661351121,1708512830,True,4,0,0.478489220142364502,2,True,False,False

The game will be glitchy and very laggy if you don't have the correct system settings for display/video, or not the correct hardware to handle the game! 

For Everyone:
I found, as a real life hunter and fisher from very very young child to this point in my senior years, that out of all the games I have played over the years looking for a game that could come as close as possible to the actual hunting part of my lifetime's experiences experience, that this game and the game theHunter have been the only 2 that have so far come even close. I like in this game how they can give you different experience level options, and more than the seemingly industry standard of 3. There are a variety of the typical firearms available and from what I've seen with my older grand kids, the lower levels do present some good pointers so that they can work their way to higher experience stages and need to rely much less, if at all, of the help in the lower levels. I like how the scopes act realistically when sighting them in and taking a shot. 

For the Creators:
Things have a realistic type feel for a semi-so-so experience with the game play, however, there are some ideas for the creators:

1. Consider adding in a future update the sounds made when walking and going thru brush. You can't be stealthy walking thru branches and twigs and what not. 

2. Consider eventually adding in the needs to eat (and healthy drinks and high calorie foods that can be taken on the go); bandage and heal the injuries that may occur when you are out hunting. You can't fix injuries or hunger in real life with just sleep for an entire season.

3. Maybe add in a hunter's training and survival experience module so that newbies to the sport itself can find out best practices in the event they DO ever decide to try the sport in real life. (So, for those who have NEVER hunted wild animals and a guided hunt or on a game farm do NOT count.)

4. Allow the player to make their own avatar. Not everyone looks the same, and not all women hunters are 40 and younger! This game seems very geared towards the male of our species in all ages...but only 2 of the avatars are female and both guessing between 20-40, really!!??!! That is VERY old thinking. My daughters and grand daughters were all raised to hunt from young ages (in a tree stand with one of us, their parents/grandparents, in their 1st year of life, yes, not the most successful hunt due to noise, but that is life and it is now something they truly enjoy), and that was one thing that was pointed out to me that they would love to see.

5. Clothing changes and what comes with it, like specific colors for specific regions/hunts/seasons (blaze orange....ever heard of it?), and scent blocking or the ability to just hang it outside on a line, for specific items of clothing.

6. When you get up into the mountainous regions, it can get harder to breathe. You may want to bring that affect into the game as well.

So many content creators for these types of games don't realize that with the games they are creating that  they are influencing and helping to give education on these types of outdoor sports that you don't exactly see in the Olympics, but you do in survival and fun in the outdoor sports realm. If we want to help the younger generations, which this sport has become very much a male AND FEMALE sport, we need to really get them curious to learn more in real life about it. If this is their first experience with this sport, this is a good starting point, but there are things that can definitely make it great, meat and trophies above the rest! (I do apologize if some of these things have been or are already addressed!)

Thank you for a game that is, other than that other one, SOOOOO MUCH BETTER that anything else out there so far!

Spent hours polishing up the graphics, but there's a still a hard ""motion blur"" on the edges of objects, terrain, etc that I can't seem to turn off (regardless motion blur is off in the ini, no TAA etc) and it's noticeable, distracting and immersion breaking, seeing edges of things 'dither' (rather than actually blur) on movement, the birds and the bees are little more than a cluster of semi-unidentifiable pixels.
Yo... You can still upscale without making the game look like it fell out of a 2002 games console. The abuse of effects on this game is simply astounding. I imagine this might work for a console visually, but PC wise the graphics are a massive mess.

That being said, whilst this games a bit more 'realistic' than other games of it's genre and better difficulty settings. Blood trails without highlighting are actually pretty visible, grass can deform for tracks and other things. Animal behaviour is better. You can influence populations etc.

-The trophy system is like RL & does not depend on the weapon used.  This is huge for me as I can hunt with my RL caliber (270 win) & not have my trophy penalized.  Only the money earned is affected.
-Animal render distance is good at ~1 KM.  But this positive is partially negated since the spotting ID is only 270 m.
-Ballistics are good, maybe a bit too good as all rifles get a buff on energy retained at range vs RL.
-Habitat management is great & makes you feel invested in the reserve.
-A choice of difficulty levels gives you the ability to change some parameters to fit your preference.
-Simple need zone times makes them a lot easier to remember.  E.G all tier 5 herbivores have the same basic schedule.
-The devs give you free content that you will actually use like the Bushnell 3.5x21 rifle scope & tripods.

The Bad
-I hate the animal aggression bc it is so blatantly outrageous compared to RL.  The vast majority of RL hunters will never be attacked by a wild animal, not even a single time.  I hunt in RL & no one I know has ever been attacked by a wild animal.  But in game my character is attacked at least once every other day & sometimes multiple times a day.  It is the biggest immersion killer for me bc it is so fake, arcade compared to RL hunting.  It is a terrible idea to assume that everyone wants to hunt in this environment.  It sucks the fun, enjoyment, immersion right out of the game for me.  Two possible solutions:  1-give us a button to turn it off or 2-limit the aggression to truly aggressive animals like cape buffalo, brown bear, Kodiak bear.  Either one of these is a lot more like RL than what we have now.  This awful, in your face design choice must be addressed.
-The game is still a bit rough around the edges like the 270 m spotting ID being way too short, no buckshot or slugs, only one type of arrow, etc.  I suspect a lot of these things will be addressed in time.

In summary, the game has a lot of very good features that can make it an excellent hunting game, but the one size fits all on OP animal aggression kills it for me.  It is the only issue keeping me from going ""all in"" on this game.",1707239683,1707241034,True,5,0,0.533932089805603027,0,True,False,False

I have some minor complaints as well; for example, I found tracking and the hunting towers pretty useless so far. There is a bigger chance of stumbling upon another animal before you either get to the tower or before you find the prey you have been tracking for hours. And if you get to a tower, you will wait for hours.

The lands are so sparse of animal life - no herds - most time 6 seems to be the number which am unsure why- but I have laid for hours waiting for stuff to just wonder by.

I love the game so far  :)

Despite me having like no hunting experience whatsoever (neither rl or game wise) I was able to get the hang of it pretty fast. Which is amazing considering the complexity of the game. But the in-game encyclopedia does a great job at explaining important stuff like balistics, movement, animal behaviour, tracking, genetics, herd management and more.

Sound, visuals and atmosphere are really good and I do like the slow pace of the game. Following animal tracks to discover their need zones or slowly sneaking up to animals to about 100m or even less (my record was about 40 m infront of a mule deer herd without getting spotted) is something I enjoy a lot. 

And landing your first shot to the heart so the bigger animals instantly drop with no need to track is such a rewarding feel. 

Also the game encourages you to pick targets of herds carefully with a herd management mechanic (instead of just shooting everything you see). If you take out the animals with ""weak"" genetics/fitness the herd is more likely to bring forth stronger animals, which yield better trophies. So sometimes you'll just watch a herd to see how they are developing. Awesome!

Edit: Bug section removed since those I encountered seem to have been fixed completely. 

Still enjoying the game btw :) ",1661264304,1706473547,True,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

This would be the next point that they would have to include, dogs, and that they could take several, not just one per person.

***I've played The Hunter Classic since 2010 (literally 1000's of hours).  The graphics in this game are very nice and updated.  There are some quirky settings when it comes to the anti-aliasing.  Just find the setting you like and go with it.  Another setting issue that I experienced was trying to limit my frames (a new setting) to 120 fps.  This caused glitches of random black squares flashing in from time to time making think maybe my 2080Ti was overheating.  Nope, so I turned it off.

***Animal antler/horn variance.  The antlers and horns start to vary once you get into the 3 star and above ranges.  Smaller, or younger, animals kind of all look the same with minor variations.  However, with that being said, I have 80 hrs on record and have been all over Nez Pers Valley and have yet to see above a 3 star White Tail or Mule Deer.  I've literally seen only one 3 star White Tail and maybe four 3 star mulies.  Oh, and white tail deer/mulies are not hard to find.  They're everywhere.  I have seen a couple of 4 star Elk and Moose, but they are really deep off in the map.  Apparently, 4 and 5 star antlered animals are really rare.  Like ridiculously rare.  I shot a 4 star Big Horn Sheep in like 20 minutes of obtaining property access to that area.  Seen a bunch since.  The only 5 star anything that I've seen are badgers and birds.  Not that exciting to me.

***Movement is a problem!  There are several ways to travel.  In a vehicle or on foot obviously.  I have found that I can get closer to a group of animals in a vehicle, hop out and shoot one, and drive to get it, than I can on foot.  Being on foot can be seriously frustrating.  Standing and walking scares off everything within 200+ yds.  Standing and running... well obviously that's worse.  Kneeling and normal speed alerts animals from 150 yards (this can occasionally vary).  Kneeling and slow speed it obnoxiously SLOW!  Luckily 'F' allows for movement without pressing the 'W' key.  Press F and go fix a sandwich if you're crawling or walking slow and you have more than 50 yards to travel.  Here's the problem with this.  Animals are alerted no matter where they are in relation to you.  I have scared herds of buffalo (and Elk, deer, etc) off from 120 yards away, kneeled, and walking slow, WHILE the buffalo is over a ridge of a mountain and the wind is blowing to my back!  WHAT?  Seriously?  How did they know I was there???  Don't even think about crawling.  Yeah, worse than obnoxiously slow, AND they still see you and hear you from like 100 yards away.  So, yeah, having a hill between you and the subject of your frustration and trying to sneak up to the peak of it... doesn't really matter.  They can apparently see through hills, rocks, trees etc.  My advice... Just drive up to within like 40 - 50 yards from the animal with a vehicle, get out and shoot it, OR get good at long range shots.  When moving through mountains, or steep terrain, be careful.  A sudden step onto a slope grade that is not any different than the one you're already on can result in to a slide into unconsciousness.  That'll screw up your day when you have to restart your journey from the cabin 2 miles back when it took you and hour and a half to get there to begin with.

***Animal animations are pretty decent.  They get quirky once they're on an inclined surface and their heads are all sideways while they're looking at you from 100 yards away because you crawled too loud for an hour trying to get to them and they spotted you.  The flying animals are animated nicely.  The badgers, I suppose they're animated correctly.  Never actually seen one before.  Badgers do get aggravating when they attack you... yeah I know.  Out of the blue you hear your guy go ""Uuuh"" and a little badger goes running by.  7mm mag takes care of that though.

***Scents / Calls / Other gadgets.  The guns, scopes, and calls are all modeled very well.  The animations of the character are quite well also.  Although occasionally you'll get the character loading two rounds after shooting once.  Meh, not a big deal.  There are no scents!  Today's hunter has a variety of scent lures, and scent covers, available to them.  So, until they add this feature, you're stuck with trying to get within 250 yards of an animal so you can call it with a caller.  Adding a scent cover is definitely needed.  The wind blows different directions throughout the hunt.  OH YEAH... Where's MY Portable Stand or Blind???

***The sounds are hit or miss for me.  The deer grunts are like beer belches.  However, the males can also bleat like females.  That's weird to me.  The elk sound true to life for the most part.  The moose sound fairly good as well.  All the birds are decent too.  The wolves though.  Sound like an ambulance coming to save you.  The wolf said, ""WOOOOoooo"", and ""WOOOooooooooooo"".  Maybe that's how they sound in the mountains.  Idk.  As far as sound goes, hopping inside of a vehicle and driving off will leave you with hearing loss if you do not adjust your sound after cranking up.  Vehicles are really loud compared to the rest of the game.  The radio feature is cool thou.

***Money / Trophies / Lodges.  The money system isn't too bad.  You can actually accrue money relatively fast if you shoot everything in sight.  Stick to shooting adult or mature animals if you can though.  The payout is bigger.  Saving an animal for a trophy is super easy.  The creativity in different displays is also very nice.  Getting creative with your taxidermized animals in the lodges makes the lodges look really nice.  Following the story can get you in contact with some pretty neat animals as well that can be stuffed and put on display.

Anyway, there are some things that I missed covering like the other maps, vehicle driving problems like not having a ""vehicle reset"" button when you're stuck high center on an elk antler, but for the most part, these are the good and the bad for me in the areas that I like hunting in.  I know there's probably someone out there like ""Bro, I can get within 4 yards of a herd of Mulies and shoot 3 of them before they even get spooked!"".  Well, good for you, Hero.  I can't.

At the end of the day, the game is a good game.  Just don't take it too serious.  It is a game after all.  I recommend the game if you have family or friends that you like hunting with.  The multiplayer option works fairly well.  It's a good change of pace when you just want to relax for a bit in the open environment.

The game, once properly tweaked with the NVIDIA game filter, is beautiful and nearly stunning! 

I like that hunting pressure is not nearly permanent as it is on COTW and I love being able to end the game and pick back up ANYWHERE. 

I also love that I don't have to pay to sleep, which is one of the dumbest things in COTW.

I like being able to have multiple tracking markers and the ability to clear them all at once.

I believe the sound quality is better than in COTW which I always felt was much louder than it had any call to be in most cases.

In the end, once you can finally just play the game without the ridiculous quests, it is a decent game.

The BAD:

The story line is absolutely, embarrassingly stupid! If the storyline had been any longer in order to open up the real game - I'd have quit from nausea alone. I mean both this game and its only real rival COTW have some seriously tree hugging quests which are SO politically correct that I get queasy just reading them, but WOTH is so bad as to be childishly stupid.

Regarding the graphics - as I said earlier, you HAVE to filter the graphics on this game. Holy crap! This game looks like it was painted with all bright primary colors that are so saturated that it hurts the eyes to look at long term. I honestly wonder if the development team has optic issues because it is really THAT bad. It took me almost two hours of tweaking so that it looked good both with and without the hunting sense AND in bright and dark areas. This was no small feat. Once I was done however - it really is visually stunning! So the devs must have done a good job, but MAN the native settings are crazy oversaturated and has genuine lighting issues.

I wish this game had a minimap you could toggle on and off. I find it tedious to have to go to a full map every time I need to get my bearings.

I REALLY wish this game would keep a record of what weapon you were using, the distance and such details in your kill log. It does offer some good info, but things you think it would include it does not! 

As far as actual game play - this game is way... WAY easier than Call of the Wild. I mean I've logged 600 hours on COTW and only 42 on WOTH and I've already killed 109 animals. I'm not sure I've killed much more than that in COTW in over 6x's more game hours. I can tell you for a fact that shots that NEVER would have downed an animal on COTW (and in reality shouldn't) drop animals like flies in Way of the Hunter. I'm not playing the hardest level mostly due to tracking issues, but from the beginning I've played the second to the hardest level and quite honestly it is a cakewalk and that robs you of some of the fun.

I have a bit of a love/hate relationship with the tracking in this game. I wish there was a difficulty level where it was MUCH harder to sneak up on and score a good kill WITHOUT taking the highlighted tracking away. I understand the added difficulty in tracking for some people, but tracking a wounded animal is NOT why I am playing this game.

I really wish they would make tents you could fast travel too like in COTW as well as hunting stands. That would be a HUGE asset to this game!

In the end I like this game- it's a fun diversion. I think COTW and WOTH both have their strong points and weak points. Where WOTH shines IMO is the graphics ONCE you seriously tweak them.",1705269639,1705269639,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Way of the Hunter provides a unique experience with realistic animal animations, behaviors and a gorgeous landscape. However, driving is horrendous and the car is super buggy (no pun intended). In a game as large as Way of the Hunter mobility is everything. The limited fast travel points and inability to fast travel to the car really takes away from the experience. Maybe this is Nine Rocks Game's way of encouraging players to unlock the achievement for traveling 7 km prone. Unfortunately, it's impractical to expect games to release fully complete and polished without content locked behind future DLCs and season passes. Similar to COTW, this game could become something spectacular in 2-3 years once all the bugs and player concerns have been ironed out.

3/29/23 Update: After returning from a 7-month hiatus, the game seems unchanged. The developers have added a few new animals, fixed various bugs, and improved audio quality, but driving is still horrendous and there remains an increased desire for QoL improvements that are usually standard with these types of games. A recent patch discussed the significance of driving, adding additional vehicles. It doesn't matter if I'm in an ATV or a Jeep, my vehicle still gets wrecked every time I hit a small tree or log. Player mobility is still highly limited to camp sites or safe houses. Honestly, I'm very disappointed in the lack of player mobility and transportation options. The one main difference I've found is that animals drop immediately from vital organ shots. I'm not one to complain about not tracking my kill while following the randomly disappearing blood pattern, but there's hardly any difficulty when you're taking spine/lung shots. On that same note, harvested animals return a lot less money compared to launch. ~$200 for a white-tail buck? Lol, get out of here. This is high-quality organic venison. The objective/task UI is terrible. The player has to have the specific objective tracked/highlighted in order to progress it. Though I appreciate the game warning me my harvest-able animal is part of a quest step, objective progression should occur regardless. I shouldn't need to pause, find the correct task, and highlight it before harvesting the animal. It's truly amazing this crap still exists in 2023. Thank you for adding colorblind options - much appreciated. I can expect this game to receive more updates and patches with it's recent console release, but even with new reserves and animals I doubt I'll be playing much more. I'd still consider it a playable game, but there just aren't enough quality differences to stand out from CotW.

1/9/24 Update: Oof. Played an hour. Harvested 5 mule deer. I never noticed just how slow weapon/tool equipping and stowing is. There is at least a 1 second delay on controller for each input. So, it's 4-5 seconds to stow my weapon, 2-3 seconds to equip binoculars, another 4-5 seconds to stow binoculars, and another 2-3 seconds to equip my caller. Rinse and repeat. Seems like this is just going to be a game I download for a night every 9 months or so. Or not.

Then out of sheer luck i see the heard stuck in trees so I ran up got 20 and change m from them and shot two one broad side also the other was left lung and probably other organs along the way down.

all and all it's a fun game which was successful in beating HCOTW in design concepts but at it's current stage with the flaws that it has, it's mediocre at best but still fun for the price you pay and totally worth it.
of course there is still a ton of room left for improvements. and as the final note, the armory is just simply too small in variety and too vague in performance expression.",1704470601,1704470601,True,1,0,0.503816783428192139,0,True,False,False

the hunter sense , ballistics, the environment, are all way better than the older game people are comparing this too.

i purchased the 5.99 call of the wild, and was extremely disappointed, that it was the EXACT same as the classic hunter.  but played for awhile cause as a buddy group we were setting up a day to hunt.  

and the first trip we shot a moose that just ran straight ahead and killed my hunting partner.  (was funny)

but another friend chose this game from the sale, so i purchased it, went on a hunt and the exact same scenario happens! 
female moose protecting its mate, bolted out of the bush and hunted down my partner and killed him!
and then proceeded to come at me, unfortunately for the moose i had the Remington guide rifle and didn't miss my  two shots to the heart.  The excitement plus humour that in two games and on the exact same first hunt on both, ended this way!

I can say without a doubt, way of the hunter is the game, and i cant wait for the many upgrades and changes they bring to the table.  thanks THQ Nordic",1704327181,1704327181,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are two free maps that are both about 50-60 square miles, two DLC maps (as of writing this review), loads of guns, scopes, and gear (which all have real brand names such as Remington, Steyr Arms, and Leupold), so many different animals, a super long story which will last you a few days, tons of side missions, and did I mention the REALISM? The animals are by far the most realistic in terms of behavior and looks of any game, even Red Dead Redemption 2. For example, you have to locate the drinking, eating, and sleeping zones of animals by following paths in the grass they made, and you have to watch the animals as you approach to see if they are noticing you. Also, there is a system called genetics/fitness, which is kind of like herd management, like in real life where farms breed the largest males to get larger and larger bucks. Genetics/fitness is such an awesome feature because you can kill the males with bad genetics/fitness in a herd, and the new males will slowly become better and better trophies, just like in real life! And you can do the opposite, by killing all the good genetics/fitness males and make the herd be all bad genetics. And if you kill a lot of males, there will be more females, and thus more animals in the herd eventually. But if you only shoot females, there will slowly be less and less animals in the herd. And of course, there are hundreds and hundreds of reasons why this game triumphs over most other hunting games, but I only shared a few reasons to make it not a 15-page essay.
In conclusion, I recommend this game to anyone who likes hunting or hunting games. If you are still unsure of whether to buy it or not, just watch a couple videos on YouTube about it and you can get some better information.

Graphics are gorgeous, animals act realistically, decent selection of weapons altho hopefully more will come. And IMO the best ballistics when it comes to actually hitting the animals of any game ive played yet. not to mention a more realistic animal scoring with included animal aging. IE you see a young buck who has a decent rack, if you let him live next time you see him he might get bigger and be a better trophy. 

Overall I prefer this game over TheHunter series because of the better feel to the shooting in the game, all the realism details, and the better imo trophy system+aging system. Not to mention I love that some weapons and gear are actual real world brands, not just knock off video game branded clones or totally made up rifles like some of the competition uses. Its a nice touch. There are areas I feel the game could be improved, mainly in adding more equipment like decoys, hunting stands, ect. Some of which has already been mentioned by the devs themselves. So altho I would say I wish there was more in the game now, it appears more is on the way so I wont complain about that too much in the meantime. Especially considering theHunter classic which has the most expansive selection of gear, equipment and weapons is far older, and TheHunter CoTW which is the closest to this game out there, also doesnt have a whole lot more then this in that regard, so It wouldnt be hard for this to catch up in time and even surpass it.

Overall this game is fantastic as is right now at the end of 2023, but already shows the potential of improving and potentially outpacing the competition. I hope the devs realize they are on to something great and keep working hard on this! Because im in love.",1703704029,1703704029,True,1,0,0.503673017024993896,0,True,False,False

Graphics, Animal Realism and Behaviour, Render Distance is a big one too. The Animal populations are also more realistic, without sacrificing the quantity and quality of the species that are available to hunt. If you enjoy a truest realistic call to what real hunting is about, this game is for you. Hunting that takes patience using your head and not just running everywhere to see what you can see but planning out your hunts, and being prepared to walk a good distance to try and hunt down those elusive animals and trophies and calling them in when you cant get as close as you want to get a good shot.

Pro's of this game:
- realistic hunting experience
- very well composed world
- nice UI design
- huge knowledge base available for the player

Con's after playing:
- quite over-saturated (some UE4 games have this strange HDR problem)
- changing some setup-elements did not really affect the game (e.g. depth-of-field didn't change for me)
- smaller mission-design-related things (no markers on your map, so that tracking an animal is very tedious)

You will also see that I have refunded this game. Why did I do this?
This game is very well composed and done in a great way, but I do not see myself putting a whole lot of hours in this game. I play after work and even with the easiest setup you will still have to put in some effort, where I do not see myself doing it over and over again. If you have some time and also your head is not already drained - this game is for you.

It has 5 difficulties but don't think it will be like running and shooting. It is like hunting in real life need plan and waiting for hours but nothing more satisfying than hunting with one shoot. 
Guns sound and feel great, I played in ultra settings 4k 144hz and game looks amazing with no issue. my only issue with the game there is no brightness/gamma settings, game looks so dark if i increased the monitor brightness than it will looks gray except if i used HDR1000 it'll be fine. - it could be my issue- idk
- Also as Jeep Wrangler owner i am ashamed of driving ingame jeep it handle, sound, and drive so bad.-

When WOTH released, I gave it a shot and watched it grow through development. It continues to grow and improve, so what negatives I list for WOTH may be fixed or improved in the months or years to come.

That said: The following list is in COMPARISON to COTW, so what is considered a negative or positive is purely subjective but may not be such for a player like you!

What WOTH offers:
+ Accurate ballistics and penetration physics
+ Very in-depth and accurate anatomy for any game you can hunt (COTW falls short with this)
+ Higher render distance (allows shots up to 1km)
+ Herd management encouraging ethical hunting strategies
+ Gene pool system which ties into herd management (local populations will change and age based on your culling habits)
+ Realistic and quality animal animations (jumping after being shot, bedding when wounded, animal appearance changes based on maturity besides just their trophy organ)
~ (personal opinion), Trophy ratings are not nearly as gratifying as COTW
- Smaller maps (and hence a more crowded animal population)
- Fewer maps and species diversity in total (give the game time and this will not be an issue)
- Herd behaviors are not as seamless or ""natural"" looking
- Graphics are not very reliably performant or stable 
- Gameplay progress is not challenging (and dare I say it, almost arcade-y)

What COTW offers (in difference):
+ Very reasonably priced main game + DLC
+ ^ A surplus of content due to game lifespan (published 2017)
+ Expansive and diverse maps (that you can explore for FREE in multiplayer)
+ In-depth animal AI (herd traveling mechanics and population balance)
+ Gratifying and challenging gameplay loop to keep you hooked for a while
+ Trophy ratings for all animal species are well implemented and are a primary motivator for playing
~ Hunting is not challenging once you have understood the basics of the game 
~ Allows for unrealistic, unethical hunting strategies such as herd culling + very little reward penalty for using the wrong calibre and making subpar shots
- Animal animations and models are not real-world accurate for the most part
- Animal behavior is predictable, robotic, and stagnant
- There is no real ""population management"" mechanic implemented in the game authentically (google diamond Herd Management for in depth info on that)

Compare and contrast these pros and cons and decide on your own if you think WOTH is worth your time. While this game does not offer too many hours of gameplay, as long as you are truly dedicated you will enjoy every moment. This game is young and already doing very well. I am eager to see how it progresses over the years!",1702597461,1702597461,True,52,1,0.840397417545318604,0,True,False,False

The challenge of the hunt can be frustrating, but they do require skill which is difficult to find in game these days. The story is less desirable to me, but you're not technically forced to follow it.

They are starting to apply the practice of DLC for the sake of income. This is something the typically deters me from supporting a game. DLC abuse is rampant across the gaming industry. If the developers can make certain the DLC always provide significant additional value for the price, then I can support them on it.

As it stands, purchasing the base game will provide tons of challenging hunting. I don't know if the maps are worth $9,99USD a piece. I have a difficult time putting that price on something that doesn't really add much to the game itself except the same loop in a different scenery.

The gun pack, for me, should have been free. There is absolutely no value in adding them to your options other than being a fan of the manufacturer. They add nothing to the game and are not worth $4,99USD by any means.

The Season Pass does include the 1st two maps and the hunters pack. So... you save $2,98USD if you purchase the season pass. The gun pack should have been a part of the Season Pass. The developers need to PICK a monetization. Are we going to do DLC abuse or Season Pass paywalling? I hope it doesn't go the route of MTX predatory tactics.

TLDR; The game is worth the base price. Save $3 and get the season pass to get a ""full game"" for ~$60. You can easily find 60 hours of enjoyable hunting simulation in this game. The gun pack is a bit of a cash grab and feels a bit dirty considering it should be part of the season pass system if they are going to continue that monetization system.

Pay close attention to the monetization plans of this game. It could quickly spiral into repeated cash grabs via DLC abuse.",1702410882,1702410882,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As a long time fan of theHunter series, I can say this to contrast: WotH is far less arcade-y than Call of the Wild, and way more in-depth than Classic (which I love dearly). The cons I feel are centered around featuring brands that are more tacticool than functional (all these illuminated BDC reticles for instance), and that animals are steadfast in their routines, and rarely - if ever - wander from their herd.

The bullet physics and Elk behavior make It a game I can put a lot more time into if I the drawbacks don't drive me away.

And there are some major drawbacks to it.  

The Graphic are great, for the first 75 meters of render distance.  After that the LOD on vegetation is set to low and there is no way to increase that range,  Now if spend all of your time looking through a scope instead of where you going then trees and bushes in the distance are high LOD.  But there are two LODs high looks good or low that looks like crap.  This is clearly a symptom of Consolitis because the Devs consider PC gaming an after thought.

In some cases herd management is broken because the game spawns herds with only one members and they will never grow.  If you shoot the lone member of that herd after days a new lone member will spawn but the herd never grows.  As a case in point look at the Lone Elk the drinks on the river just west of Bear Den Ranch.  Another case of broken herd management is the quest to kill Hollywood the Mule Deer.  After he is dead the entire herd is composed solely of females for the rest of time.

Another point of unrealistic failure is predation.  Wolves and foxes just magically get food.  They don't hunt and kill other animals.  Predators are really just more herds for you to manage instead of being allies you need to look after so they can help you manage the herds and cull the sick and weak animals.

In story quests the voice actors characters are so serious as they read they their cheesy lines I have to give them credit.  I couldn't do that with a straight face.  The misplaced desire to put yet another morality play as the center piece of yet another hunter game tested my patience to no end.  I found my self taking off my headset for the dialog and browsing the WotH wiki instead of tuning in to it.  I would have turned it off completely but you have to be in story mode to unlock all of the private lands to hunt on.

So unless you are looking for a hunting game that's only selling is pretty good hunting, you don't mind, mediocre at best graphics, and you like to read romance novels written by by writers that get their scripts rejected by TV soap operas, it's worth paying full price for.

Since several people are doing a comparison to cotw I wanted to create a chart, so you know what you're getting into. 

PROS OVER COTW
-gun models, sounds, and ballistics are 1000X better (and bows are way better imo)
-driving is actually enjoyable in this game
-the graphics are much better
-the aging system of animals, you can pass a small male, and play the game and come back to it after a couple in game days and it will be a larger animal, but you cant wait too long or the animal will get too old and die. You can tell when a animal is getting really old because their fur changes colors (typically grey) 
-The map is absolutely massive, I have 50 hours and have not explored it all, and I love how animals have their own habitats 
-the overall realism of shooting, and tracking an animal.
-I think the story is overall better on the base map at least
-difficultly modes to tune your play style, the easiest will be like cotw, the hardest is even harder than irl hunting imo. 
-Animal AI is way more realistic, and I love how when you shoot an animal it reacts base on where the hit was, and the blood is very different, example if you hit an artery there is a long trail of blood to the animal. 
-Animal models look much better
-(This is a big one for me) You can see animals at around 900 yards, and make those super long shots, in cotw I think its around 400 or so. 

OVERALL CONS
- (The biggest con for me) NO ""Great ones"" Or non typical animals. I think this game needs this more than anything, once you get a level 5 (diamond in cotw) you basically have no reason to hunt that animal species anymore. There is rare fur types, and I love that, but I want ultra rare variants of animals, and I think the devs need that to be at the top of their priory list. 
-Another big con, predators don't have a big difference from a low level animal to a high. Especially in smaller species like foxes. 
-This game is a lot more intensive on your computer, I think it could be optimized a little better
- There no weather system like cotw, I want rainy days where visibility is limited for both the hunter and animal. 
- It does have alot less animals, weapons and maps than cotw, but this game is alot newer, and the devs are adding more content, and active with updates. 
-(very slight con) Trophy mounts in this game are way cooler, but limit you more, it could be a pro or a con depending on how you look at it. I dont like how you cant mount female deer or elk heads, theres some full body mounts you can use to mount females, but most the shoulder mounts you have to mount a male, I want to show off my albino females next to my males.
 
In summary I highly recommend this game, after playing cotw and getting tired of the arcade feel where you can just run around and shoot animals I wanted something more like real hunting and this is it. I would recommend this game at full price. Hopefully the devs stay true and keep pushing out content, because if they do I believe this game will overtake cotw. JUST ADD GREAT ONES OR SOMETHING SIMILAR

Better than Call of the wild in a few ways, only way i can tell call of the wild is better is that in it you can change weapons and scopes on the move whereas in this if you have a teir 6 and a tier 5 weapon you cant  change it to any other weapon without restarting a hunt which is not fun at all, for example if you see tier 1 animals (Which are everywhere) you can shot it with the weapons you have and not get the same rewards as you would with the proper equipment

This game is better for me than COTW. Why ? Because I don't get as many animals walking in front of my scope, and instead of shooting down a whole herd of bison and having a carnage, I choose the oldest male or least fit animal and shot that one down.

Why ? Because of herd management in WOTH. If you shoot down the old males and the unfit ones, the idea behind the logic is that herd will later evolve into better animals, giving you a stronger herd as well as better trophies.

In COTW I can basically just wipe out an entire herd of bison in one go.  

In WOTH (and mind you I'm still learning) I get one maybe 2 out of the herd. 

In COTW I'm like wow look at nature! Wonderful ! In WOTH it's even better.

There is a lot I love about this game's trophy system.  Conceptually, this game would have been a very serious hunting simulator!  However, the product we have to play doesn't hold up to that potential!  

It is visually stunning ... well at least the atmosphere and environment.  As you walk through the wilderness on your hunt, the views you make you pause and appreciate your surroundings.  With a draw distance of 1 km, the game feels more alive since animals can be seen in the far distance.  Unlike TheHunter: Call of the Wild which can feel dead at times and really silly when animals just pop in your POV out of thin air.  Finally, the animals movement is great, at first.  Herds reacting to your movement, sound, or smell together is a great touch that makes them feel more realistic.  The herd's general movement across the map looks great as well.  They feel like they are walking on earth and not an asset traveling across a map.

I also love the way the game handles animal spawning and its creation of trophies.  Animals feel like they have an actual life cycle.  They age as time passes in the game.  Their aesthetics and AI change as they age.  The more mature an animal gets, the higher their trophy potential is.  This causes you to manage herds throughout the game giving that feel that you are growing your trophies!  The concept is exactly what I want from a hunting game. 
 The system implemented also has its downsides I will discuss in a bit and damage this mechanic a lot.

But as the time passes, the game fresh coating of paint starts to peel.  You start to notice the game is very bland and shallow underneath.  The cool details are copied and pasted into oblivion.  And the gameplay becomes stall and kinda cartoony the more you play.

For example, once you see a few different species you will notice the only true difference between them is the models and textures.  Otherwise, they all act the same!  Deer graze the same way bison do just as pheasants.  They react to you the same way as each other.  The only difference being the species that fly will do that to escape.  They smell you at the same distance, they hear you at the same distance.  If the models were all grey rectangles, you would not know the which one was a badger and which one was a wildebeest.  The models of the animals look average.  I would compare them to textures from in Skyrim.  

That's when the trophy mechanic shows it's flaws.  Trophies you have managed for literal in-game weeks just die on you.  Meaning that 2* you watched grow into a 4* is just gone now.  Hopefully the next trophy you manage stays alive until that elusive 5*!  I know this is a realistic aspect of hunting but this is a video game after all.  Hours of gameplay just to have your achievement disappear with no fault of your own doing is very frustrating (I played this game on console thinking the PC experience may be better.  It kinda was ...).  In the end, the herd management part of this game can feel like playing the stock market.  

And unfortunately, the worst parts of this game is the gunplay and interaction with the animals.  Everything from pulling out your weapon to shooting it feels off.  I don't feel like I am holding a rifle or shotgun or crossbow.  I feel like I am holding weapon 1 and weapon 2.  They shoot like weapon 1 and weapon 2.  Am I shooting a Remington or this gun called ""Grandpa's Old Rifle""???  I could not tell the difference between the recoils, the bolt action, or the sounds really.  And the bullet seemed to float up to the center of my sight then shoot forward.  This is the most important part of the game: how the player interacts with the world and achieve a goal!  And it just feels flat ...

I can see the potential and why some will find the game entertaining.  I recommend it for those looking for a less serious hunting experience.  Which is funny to say as the game's trophy system is very serious!  However, everything else the game has to offer isn't.  If it can combine it's trophy mechanics with the species mechanics and gunplay of theHunter: Call of the Wild, then we would have something truly special!",1699804329,1700267082,True,36,3,0.690870285034179688,0,True,False,False

It does require a modern PC to enjoy the full experience but if you like the emphasis on herd managing this is the game for you as COTW dosent actually require that exploit to get Great Ones, this game uses that as its main feature. Lastly i do think this game needs more emphasis on animals coexisting, seeing herd animals crammed into zones makes it feel like an arcade at times.

Let's get into how Way of the Hunter does things.

- Animal behavior seems more realistic. One spooked animal will, in turn, spook the whole herd. Hunting pressure can cause animals to completely avoid an area for a while. Deer, elk, etc. all seem to graze or ""feed through"" a zone rather than standing stationary for the entire feeding session. Deer will turn their ears and flick their tails while they feed, periodically raising their heads and looking around. Also, whitetails will show their trademark white tail when fleeing, and mule deer have that graceful mulie hop. I've yet to see a herd return to a need zone in the same day after being shot at.

- Animal aggression is a recently added feature. I've only experienced it once in-game so far, in which I was charged by a single mountain goat after spooking the entire herd. Seemed a little...arcadey. You can look back through the patch notes to get an idea of their initial implementation of aggression. Not a huge fan of how they've set it up, but I'm sure it will be refined as the developers continue making improvements.

- Weapon ballistics are much better than COTW, factoring in bullet velocity, gravity, wind, elevation, and coriolis (so I'm told). Terminal ballistics is measured in joules, and each animal has a range of joules (low to high) which is most effective for an efficient kill. You aren't punished for overkill in the trophy lodge (doesn't lower trophy rating), but the idea of overkill and reduction of harvestable meat does result in lower monetary payouts for using ""too much gun"".

- Blood trails are one of my favorite features of the game. If you turn off the glowy bits in the UI settings, you must actively search for blood, which may be on the ground, on the grass, or on the stem of a bush the deer ran through. Blood has different colors based on what organs were (or weren't) hit, and different impurities (such a bubbles or bits of grass) to help you determine if you made a good shot or not.

- The maps are big...more that you'll want to try to walk acoss, and very detailed. The terrain geometry is well done, and I've yet to see tears in textures or seams where two sections of the map meet. Overall, the scenery is gorgeous.

- Graphically, it looks good. The anti-aliasing could be toned down a bit, but I run a sharpening filter through the nVidia overlay to reduce fuzziness and film grain.

- Performance is good. I'm running a GTX 1080 8GB, Ryzen 7 3600, 32GB of DDR4, with WotH installed on an SSD, and a 1080 60Hz LCD monitor. I get around 50 fps on average with all settings at max.

- WotH solves my single biggest issue with COTW - its locked 480m render distance. Way of the Hunter will render as far out as your system will handle, which makes proper spot-and-stalk hunting much more realistic and fun.

- All hunting stands are prebuilt and spread around the map. Most that I've found so far have been in decent locations.

- Herd quality (overall trophy ratings) can be improved by removing low-fitness males from the herd (culling). This will, over time, give you more opportunity to take a nice trophy animal. Killing females will lower the overall population of a herd.


Now, for some of the things Way of the Hunter doesn't do so well.

- Vehicle physics in WotH are pretty bad. The atv seems to be a bit better than the jeep, but it's still not great. This is ultimately a minor issue, since that really isn't the focus of the game.

- There are no mobile spawn points. Not gonna lie, I got really spoiled by the tents in COTW. WotH has lodges/cabins and campsites spread throughout the map, but it can sometimes still be a bit of a walk to get to your intended hunting spot. The cabins have a spawn/retrieval point for vehicles, but the campsites are on walking trails and do not.

- There are no mobile stands like tripods or treestands. Thus, you must depend on wind direction, terrain, and foliage if you choose to ambush hunt a location without an established stand.

- Running and trekking rough terrain. Okay, developers...on the off chance that you read this, can we please get a slightly more athletic character? I mean, you play a character who is supposed to be a Hollywood stunt double that also does parkour, but he can't step over a fallen spruce tree or climb a three-foot ledge?

- Crawling/prone in general is frustrating. The animations look fine, but for some reason the camera gets all wonky and has a tendency to snap down on its own. I believe this is an unintended bug.

- The storyline is a little cheesy and the whole hunting ethics thing is way overdone. I get wanting to promote ethical hunting. It needs to be done. But I feel like I've gone 10 rounds with Mike Tyson with the number of references to ethical hunting in WotH. And if I get one more email from some gourmet chef wanting some obscure duck or goose for his dish I can't pronounce, I'm going to hunt him down and cook his goose. Really, I just want to hunt.

- The weapons selection leaves a lot to be desired. There are a number of rifles covering every class of huntable creature in the game, and I do appreciate the time and effort and cost that likely went into getting officially licensed gear, but your only two options are Steyr and Remington. The rest of the weapons selection looks generic. Shotguns are strictly limited to birds and small game, which I hope to see expanded upon the future so we can use buckshot and slugs for large game. Edit: Compound bows have been added.

- Character customization is non-existent, as you play one of three preset characters. I don't know if this is in the roadmap or not. Ultimately it doesn't make that big of a difference as camo clothing doesn't exist in the game and has zero effect (remember, terrain and foliage are your camo), and you only see your hands unless in third-person camera while driving or during one of the few cutscenes in the game.


So, while WotH may not offer the customization features or some of the quality-of-life features of CotW, it represents hunting better in the things that matter - animal behavior, natural beaty, and ballistics. And, I'm perfectly okay with that. I'd rather the developers put the time and effort into making a proper hunting game than a hunting arcade with too much feature creep.

Overall, I'd say if you're one of those who wish CotW had more realism, then add Way of the Hunter to your library. You won't be disappointed.",1679154449,1698710193,True,431,7,0.964414298534393311,2,True,False,False

Reasons why I gave negative review

1. Weapons are highly homogeneous:
Although there are a few different weapons, but they can be categorized into 4 groups (within each group all guns literally perform the same): 22./30-30 as low power, 243/308/6-08 as mid power, 270/30-06 high power, 35 Rem/300 WM/338 Laupa as very high power. Plus shotshells and useless .22/arrow/bolt (Srsly, animals can SENSE you from 200m+ away without visual contact). The recoil  and sound are also way off: when .22 feels like 30-06, you know something is wrong.

2. Choices of weapon models/calibers are....less ideal and ""poor taste"". Steyr, noice, but where is iconic Mannlicher‚ÄìSch√∂nauer and its 6.5mm, or even SSG-69 variants? OK, we have Steyr Scout...in 223, great, another useless gun in this game. This is a HUNGTING game why choosing 300 WM and 338 Lapua rather than their parent cartridges 375 H&H and 416 Rigby, which are both way more suitable for hunting? 

3. Lack of choices of projectiles, and  very inaccurate ""damage models""
All projectiles in game work like mid-large caliber JSP or heavy blunt nose projectiles: straight wound channel, no fragmentation, no yaw, no expansion: srsly, even .243 has a STRAIGHT wound channel, you must be kidding me. When projectiles hitting the bones, no fragmentation: hitting head not touching brains=nothing. Is ""damage models"" part subcontracted to Gaijin (war thunder meme.gif)? Plus things like 223 and 30-30 underperform, no buckshot or slug, etc.......

4. Nice 1903, but no adjustable flip-up sight, only battle sight which is 500m zero!!!!! Aim toes to hit body, congrat another useless gun,a total waste of a decent model. Oh, also, no clip loading, sad.
(P.S. *Remington* 1903, no problem since they did produce 1903. You guys can also make Russian 1891 aka ""Moist-Nugget"" and mark ""Remington"" as a meme, since, again, they DID produce them during WW1).

5. Grinding too hard and unnecessary: guns, gears, optics, cars.........everything including permits of EACH SECTION OF THE MAP! This is not MMORPG, what is the purpose for that?

6. Having DLC is good, pretty pricey though.

7. Things like boring story line, ""driving feels wrong"", ""normal person needs colorblind mode to see blood stains"", dead deer stand up and run away......... 

 
Anyway, A game with potential, yet still needs tons of polishing and more content. The current status of the game with price tag like this, I can't recommend for other players.

The reason is I don't have a lot of time to play this game at one sitting. Looking to play at most 30 minutes per day. In order to have any fun for that short amount of time, I have to unlock the animal need zones. Animals are very need zone dependent in this game. Unlike the other hunting game, TheHunter Call of the Wild. COTW had need zones too, but there are so many animals roaming about that I could ignore the need zones. I could just walk around and usually find something to shoot within 15 minutes.

I'm not saying the devs should make this game like COTW. But in order to unlock need zones you have to use the game's hunter sense. This is the first glaring problem. Hunter sense is poorly implemented. It's nice that it can be toggled on and off, but finding needs zones means keeping it on most of the time. Unfortunately hunter sense makes your screen darken and also blurry around the periphery. Walking around with a darkened, blurry screen causes a lot of eyestrain, and occasionally headaches.  I suppose they do this to simulate the hunter concentrating on his surroundings. Unfortunately this isn't worth the eyestrain. Remove the darkening and blurriness and just highlight need zones, tracks etc. I look forward to the day I've unlocked all the need zones and can keep hunter sense turned off. If I make it that far.

The second glaring problem is head bobbing/jerking when crawling in prone. It's very annoying and causes me to look away from the screen.  Mostly I don't go prone anymore cause it's not worth the annoyance. The devs have tried to fix this but it still needs work.

If they could fix these problems then this game has the potential to be a great hunting game. The hunting is more challenging that COTW, graphics are better, and animal behavior is more realistic. With the ability to choose different difficulty settings it caters to people like me with limited time, to hard core hunters who want a very immersive simulation.

Right now it's 5 out of 10 until they at least fix hunter sense. Could be 10 out of 10 if they keep improving it. Right now I can't recommend a game that gives me eyestrain. Devs please fix hunter sense.

Update 10/20/23. They fixed the hunter sense and head bobbing. As of now it's the best hunting game out there for me.",1679875600,1697855532,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The animal behaviors are very good for the most part, the need zone system works much nicer in my opinion than in other hunting games, and the actual stalking and hunting seems second to none currently. The herd management is a bit of a pain sometimes, but it adds value to almost every interaction. Not always taking the biggest animal is a nice change of pace. My biggest dislike is really quite immersion breaking. Terminal ballistics in this game are sometimes laughable. Bones like the scapula or spine seem to be made of vibranium, and bullets seems to penetrate them like a coffee soaked doughnut through a steel plate. Since day 1, shots that I would and have taken in real life don't do anything. The high shoulder shot is useless unless using a cartridge much larger than what should be necessary. Lung shots with smaller, but still plenty adequate, cartridges are about the same outcome. Just today I shot an elk at 200m with a 270, and he ran 250yds before expiring. A female black bear shot in the front shoulder needed 3 follow up shots because the bullet penetrated about 6"".

+fun missions
+rewarding to finally shoot the trophy you've been aging to 4-5 star, or shoot any big animals in general.
-not much choice in how you assemble your taxidermy collection.
-animal zone/population distribution is not random, animal genetics are (kinda).
+-Grinding (shooting any bad animals you may come across or from certain population) does not work like in CoTW. You need yo put more time into managing your herds/packs and increasing the overall genetic potential so you could have 5 star trophies.

I would personally add more features to keep in touch with your populations, like a interactive map where you can add notes  and mark locations.

TL:DR - If you want a quality hunting sim, this is for you. Yes you should buy it. 

Is it better than COTW? Fundamentally yes. The animal behavior is much more realistic, though there is room for refinement. Following a blood trail is the best I've seen. Ballistics are better. Draw distances are better. Good enough to actually use glassing as a real tactic. 

Not to mention the audio. The 3D sound design is some of the best I've heard. If an elk calls in the distance I can locate it using my ears. If you spook a herd of deer and they go crashing through the woods, You actually hear them go crashing through and can tell more or less right where they are. There are visual ques as well for normal difficulties but with a good set of headphones you don't need them. (I'm playing on Ranger.) Sounds are also true to life. 

Surprisingly lacking from the audio design is how you don't make extra noise running through bushes. I'm sure they'll get around to fixing that.

Weapons are improving. Archery has been added and it is mostly satisfactory. Still hoping for muzzle-loaders.

I'm not sure how I feel about the product placement. Mixed I suppose. 

The problems I have with the game are fixable, and I hope/anticipate they will be resolved. The foundation of the game is strong though. I believe it will surpass COTW as the obvious leader in the hunting sim space.

Some refinements I would like to see:

-When I ""accidentally"" run over a badger it should get flattened rather than flipping my truck.
-Sometimes in real life deer are just solo. 
-Drawing a bow right in front of an animal in real life will spook them. You can only do so when their eyes are down or covered. As of this writing you can draw right in front of an animal- doesn't matter.
-Does not seem to be a mechanic for blood loss.
-Animal injury could be refined. A shoulder shot would affect how they run, and how fast etc.
-AI and animal interactions still need some work. When a pack of gray wolves walks up to some big horn sheep I'd expect something to go down, instead of them chilling out together. On that note- if they really want to provide depth the devs should join OutdoorClass. Maybe collaborate or work some of that sponsorship deal magic.
-Animal life cycles could have more depth. The game doesn't seem to include spike elk for example. 
-Thermals? i.e. diurnal winds.

All in all still enjoyable, and my fav pick for the off season.

This game is slow-paced. It's not an action game or an arcade shooter, it's a realistic hunting game. It's about as fast-paced as Farming Simulator (which is not a bad thing to the right people)

The devs are constantly updating the game with bug fixes and new content.

Also, it's a hunting game, so I didn't go into it with high expectations for a story, but it delivered in that aspect as well! On three out of four maps (DLC), there is a story to take in, and each of them deal with tense situations regarding ethical hunting practices, like poaching, illegal trapping, and firearm safety. (I know that sounds boring, but NRG made it interesting somehow).

Speaking of which, ethical hunting is what this game is all about. The game is set up in a way that if you wipe out entire herds, they won't come back for a very long time, and you receive greater rewards for ethical hunts (shooting low fitness males, allowing young animals to grow to maturity before shooting, avoiding harvesting females) such as higher sums of money, and a hunt rating system.

Even in just under two hours of playtime, I encountered several issues that made it impossible to recommend this game.

First and foremost, the game's portrayal of animals is shockingly unrealistic. For a hunting game released in 2022, one would expect a higher level of authenticity in animal behavior. However, ""Way of the Hunter"" completely misses the mark. Animals exhibit bizarre and unconvincing behavior, making the hunting experience feel more like a caricature than a genuine simulation.

Despite having the graphics settings maxed out, I was sorely disappointed by the visuals. I had anticipated breathtaking landscapes and stunning environments but found poorly rendered unattractive scenes. In a gaming landscape where graphical fidelity has come a long way, it's disheartening to see a game released in 2022 fall so short in this department.

Furthermore, within this short two-hour timeframe, the lack of depth and variety in gameplay became apparent. Repetition set in quickly, and the limited content left me bored and unenthusiastic about continuing. ""Way of the Hunter"" lacks meaningful challenges and engaging activities, making me question the value of my time spent on the game.

In conclusion, although ""Way of the Hunter"" was released in August 2022, my initial experience left me unsatisfied and frustrated. The unrealistic animal behavior, subpar graphics, and lack of engaging gameplay elements make this game a poor choice for anyone seeking an enjoyable hunting experience.

Both games are good, but WOTH is an improvement in almost every aspect, and might appeal to someone seeking a more realistic and visceral hunting experience, over the arcade look and feel of COTW.

It can be argued that COTW ""looks better"". But, have you been to a real forest? It's just dirt and rocks, and branches. Of course, trying to closely imitate reality is not going to give you polished-looking graphics. And in photomode WOTH is near indistinguishable from reality.

If you played COTW and look for a similar but different experience, you won't be disappointed in this game, it is a lot like COTW in many aspects, but without the arcade feels.

(Best played on 40"" monitor.)

Favorite features, so far:
[list]
[*]You can pause the game while hunting, to fly around the map and see nearby animals.
[*]Bullet trajectory replay (but would be much better if it showed you entire path from gun to target, not just 2 feet surrounding the animal.
[/list]

Here's what makes it stand out against COTW:

[list]
[*]Animals are easier and faster to find than COTW (if you keep crouching.)
[*]You can hide the weapon by pressing the weapon slot key (1, 2, etc.) so it doesn't get in the view while walking, in COTW it was possible only by switching to photography mode.
[*]Clouds actually gradually change shape.
[*]The terrain feels more organic, open and expansive.
[*]Hands and weapon reloading animations are more satisfying.
[*]You can fly around the map and change time of day in real time, in photo mode.
[*]Animal models are more realistic in shape and behavior.
[*]Tracking is more fair and realistic, but takes time to get used to ""hunter sense mode"", which is active only when you're not walking (vignette effect appears, and you can see sound and tracks visualized.)
[*]Sound tracking is actually a helpful tool in locating and getting closer to animals.
[*]When you climb into a tower you can actually see your hands animate, instead of just ""teleporting"" into it.
[*]Animals are not hyper-sensitive to your movement, as someone in another review pointed out. It's actually pretty fair, and they are less sensitive than COTW. That player must have just been running around the forest, instead of crouching. This is not Counter Strike!
[/list]

It feels like an upgrade to the Classic Hunter game, but can also be seen as a competitor to COTW.

Another reviewer said there is an annoying bird sound that repeats and gets louder, as long as you stand in the same spot, and volume resets soon as you move. That must be a bug with audio card drivers, or the game, or it has been already fixed. I have not experienced that. All sounds were organic and natural. Animal sounds are more visceral and real, compared to COTW, which is more arcade in general, as well as with respect to animal sounds.

Note to developers:

[list]
[*]Improve digit ""7"" in the font. It looks a lot like 1. Once I crossed 699 $ it said 725...it looked like 125, and made me wonder why my $ dropped so much. (Only to realize it's a 7.)
[*]Display blood marks on the map (at least in beginner/easiest mode.)
[*]Display the place where animal was shot on the map (at least in beginner/easiest mode.)
[*]For animal sound tracking, use ""radiating audio waves"" animation, not the watery blob, which is confusing to someone 100% new to the game, as it doesn't communicate ""it's a sound"", as well as audio waves animation would.
[*]Might want to slow down the clouds by at least 50%. Right now their speed is, as if there is a storm, on a blue sky day.
[*]Make Shift key enable ""walk faster,"" while moving and it's pressed down, and normal speed when it's unpressed.
[*]Tracking bullet trajectory is a good feature, but make the entire path of the shot replayable from the moment it leaves the gun to animal, not just few feet around (and ability to rotate camera around the bullet as it is being tracked.)

Reading through the reviews i honestly find many being really nitpicky and flatout unfair to this game. I have played a lot in the last weeks on Ranger difficulty ""The hardest"" and had a blast. It seems impossibly hard at first, but after knowing what to look out for (which is all explained in detail) it is really straight forward and rewarding. Some also say its a buggy mess and that CotW is much more stable ... Bruh ... Cotw is one of the most broken games i ever played. Every Cotw session i play has at least a few really bad bugs that ruin the experience. In Way of the Hunter i had very little problems so far apart from minor UI glitches. Way of the Hunter also has a lot of really cool features and goes into amazing detail. It is much better from a technical standpoint, as It looks and runs better.

So my conclusion is, if you enjoyed ""The Hunter"" but you wouldn't mind a bit more realism and detail, this is for you.

August 22, 2022

Okay, so hear me out. This game is young and just released to the community. It hasn't taken long for the bugs to make themselves known, and its unfortunate that this company got plagued with them as soon as they released this game; give the developers some time. Chasing down bugs and tweaking the games sound levels I'm sure take just a little bit of time.

Graphics, they are beautiful. Game play, before bugs made mine unplayable for the time being, was actually really fun. The areas that you can hunt in seem huge in comparison to COTW. Animal behavior seems to be much better than COTW. 

It sounds like this company with get the bugs fixed up, and make the game playable again in no time. Maybe COTW developers can take notes, because they take months to fix a bug and then 3 more come back with it. 

***** NEW REVIEW AUGUST 21, 2023 *****

So, I quit playing this game a long time ago, and just recently picked it back up, and I must say great job to the developers for tackling bugs and listening to community feedback and making changes to the game. I look forward to continue playing this game for when my hunting seasons in real life are over. A thing I would like to see change is the amount of initial sway you have while ADS. It seems a tad too much. I understand it's to make it a bit more challenging, but swaying back and forth that much is just a bit over kill, IMO.

Look forward to the next couple of DLC'S!",1661704325,1693541466,True,0,0,0.472440958023071289,0,True,False,False

Enjoy aimlessly hiking through the woods, looking for an impossible to spot blood trail with next to zero assistance? Enjoy shooting a deer center mass from 100 meters only to watch it gallop off for a mile at speeds that would make Usain Bolt jealous? Then look no further than Way of the Hunter, a game so unplayable its anger inducing. 

I enjoy a challenge as much as the next gamer but wasting hours and hours looking for an animal you just shot, with zero reward isn't what I would classify as fun. This game, even on medium difficulty is laughable. After playing for 10 hours i'm certain i've found less than 10 deer i've shot. The deer can hear you coming from a mile away, even at a crawl. Then if you somehow manage to get a shot off and hit one in the vitals, it takes off running in an impossible to track zig-zag pattern through heavily forested areas. But wait, isn't there a blood trail? Good luck following it. Blood trails give little to no information about the direction of travel or amount of blood loss. Once you've lost the blood trail which happens on every single track, you're pretty much screwed. If you enjoy visuals and hiking through the woods without actually hunting anything then this game is perfect for you.

Think COTW in terms of how easy it is to learn, but bump up the mastery by about 5 and you have WOTH. The game looks far better than COTW, has an absolutely *Ridiculous* play area for each map (Vehicles are a necessity  if you don't want to fast travel everywhere kinda big), and, at least in my opinion, WOTH has a much more superior herd management and ballistics system vs WOTH. They are two drastically different games, and I hope the devs eventually add some AR pattern weapons and maybe a bit more in depth weapon customization but I can safely say I heavily favor WOTH for the actual gameplay and graphics. It's much less arcade-like than COTW without being overly complex. The tutorial does leave some to be desired if you're unfamiliar with IRL hunting theory and concepts, but theres tons of YT content for those that are new to the genre to help you learn about the more indepth mechanics this game plays into

Way Of The Hunter is honestly not a bad game and it can be a lot of fun once you start to understand how the game mechanics work. When you first start the game you have very little skill/knowledge of hunting, you are pretty much a rookie i guess you could say, over time with xp gain you will start to unlock some much needed skill's and become better and better at many things witch will then make it much easier when hunting. The tracking system will take you some time to understand how it works and how to use it correctly but once you do it will be a breeze to find/locate your kill. There is a story to this game and it is actually well done in my opinion. The game world is pretty large and can be really pretty as well. Hunting in this game is not arcade like and is a bit more difficult as it try's to mimic real life hunting as best it can. This is not a hunting game that you will be able to just kill kill kill no matter where you are in game, it takes time to find/track animals locations in this game and sometimes you may go over an hour before you find something worth killing. There is a decent amount of gear/guns you can buy in this game so you are not just stuck with 3 or 4 options. Overall the game is not bad and can be a lot of fun if you have the patience needed for it, BUT with that being said there is still issues that need to be resolved with the game. I am not going to go through every single issue as it would just take me to long to type it all out but i will list the issues that i feel are the most annoying to deal with. First issue i have noticed is the Detection mechanic and how it seems to function, i have been noticing more and more that animals seem to spot you through terrain, so for example if you are on the other side of a hill and any animal that is on the opposite side as you seem to be able to see you through the hill side and then will get spooked and run away.  I have also noticed that sometimes even if you are 200+ meters away from an animal and the wind is in your favor and you are not making much noise at all along with being well hidden they can still become spooked and run away. One of the other issues i have with this game is even though for the most part it does run pretty smooth it does have some hick ups that occur that can cause visual glitching to occur like quick flashes of screen tarrying or the ground may fail to load the textures correctly and you may seen a quick flash of unloaded textures. I want to also talk about how the driving in this game is honestly not the greatest either, it's not bad but it does leave lots of room for improvement, it just feels clunky and not very smooth at times.",1660676419,1693140693,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The graphics are great, the guns fairly realistic in their portrayal, the animal behavior generally believable (except when they attack). 

For me, the biggest problem is that there's no option to turn off the bright white outlining/highlighting of interact-able elements in the game such as dead animals, need zones, badger nests, ladders, etc. This seriously cuts into the immersion of the game, and for me, with a game like this, immersion is everything. I play with all visual clues and UI turned off, which is why it is so grating when an animal that I killed or a need zone or anything else gets a bright white outline when I look at it, but there's no way to disable this.

Aside from that, there are other minor issues, such as how you can't buy or choose what ammo you load into each weapon, or how deer sometimes attack you if they hear you shooting birds. The devs really need to stop making map DLCs and instead focus their efforts on making a better base experience, lest their game end up just like the lazy, buggy mess that is COTW.

Seriously hoping that someday I will be able to change this to a positive review...

Their launch underperformed a bit due to some bugs and a couple missing QOL features, but the core gameplay is just incredible. The environments are gorgeous, and the maps are gargantuan. After a hundred hours there's still big chunks of the first region that I've yet to step foot into. The difficulty is definitely higher than the other big hunting games, but the mechanical depth is also much better. There's a genetics system, multiple types of animal calls with a single caller, excellent bullet ballistics with real-world firearms, and detailed wound modeling of things like expansion and hydrostatic shock. The animations of the wildlife are top-tier, to the point where I'm genuinely suspicious that they managed to get a motion-capture suit on a real deer. Currently, there's four maps - Pacific northwest, Alaska, Transylvania, and Africa - and three of them have fully-voiced stories with their own protagonist. The stories are well-written, and felt satisfying to progress through. 

Overall, if you've tried other hunting games and got frustrated with the lack of features and realism, this is the game for you. If you're new to the genre, it's difficult until you get the hang of it, but the payoff is well worth it.

I'm not going to compare it to other hunting games as many reviews do this pretty well already. What I do want to add is that the realism and the immersion of this title is amazing it definitely leans to the simulation side of things. The quest line is a big plus in my book, gives you a purpose in this world and helps you to always have something to work towards while exploring. The map and biomes are really well thought out and really feel unique and rewarding to explore.

As a rule, I never buy games within a year of their release and Way of the Hunter was no exception. I've been watching the game since it came out: to start with, it seemed not to quite be up to the mark and the selection of equipment seemed rather limited. There seemed to be a lot of complaints and bugbears and so on.

I'm glad I waited: it's now an excellent game I've really enjoyed my time in the Nez Pearce reserve over the last couple of weeks. The equipment selection is good (if not exhaustive) and I have only experienced one bug (where a mission animal respawned) which led to an annoying moment where I shot it but couldn't claim it. This bug is well known, apparently. However, given I can tolerate CotW with all its ""features"", let's say expectations were low but have been far exceeded. 

(I still have a lot of time for and loyalty to CotW, but this is easily the better game - if EW come up with their ""next generation"" hunting sim, I'm sure I'll play that too.)

The other thing to mention is the difficulty. The normal difficulty is pretty hard and comes with a learning curve - even for a long-term hunting sim player. Once you're used to it though, it's fine. Good, even. But it's nice to have the option of playing a more realistic session when you want a challenge and a less-realistic one when you just need a relaxing hunt. I haven't yet tried the easiest (1st), or hardest difficulties (5th) yet, but somewhere between the 3rd / 4th is probably ""realistic"" on the basis of my own IRL hunting experience.

All those nice words aside, there are gaps which I want (and expect) to see filled at the time of writing and if you buy the game (particularly with the African reserve in mind) you should be aware of those before you spend the cash. If I'm going to be a long-term WotH player, I want to see:

- A better selection of small-to-medium game rifles (e.g. something in .25 or .26 calibre; a .17 HMR perhaps). I don't personally care about having ""proper"" licensed rifles in game and although it's ""nice to have"" I  expect it's a pain for the developers, since it makes it more costly / difficult to introduce new guns. What do you do if Remington or Winchester say ""no"" for example?
- A large bore bolt-action rifle (e.g. .416 / .458) for Africa - there are currently no rifles in the game that would be legal for most African hunting (.375 minimum, mostly).
- The ability to pick and choose cartridges for shotguns and bullet weight / construction for rifles. This would really make the game stand out, but at the moment, one has to choose shot size by choosing a shotgun gauge, where the 12 gauges shoot #3, the 16 gauges #5 and so on. This is, frankly, a bit crap.
- Zoomable binoculars. If we can have $5000 dollar optics, surely we can manage some cheapsh*t zoomable binos?

In all, there's enough here to enjoy right now, but the developer / publisher need to capitalize on the platform they've built and fill in the missing pieces if they want to achieve the kind of following that CotW has (or had).

I play with an overclocked NVIDIA 4090 direct x 11 and i get 120 frames.

My footsteps when I am standing and walking can alert animals up to 300 meters plus away. Even the cars are less noisy. I think we could have even electric cars for less noise but when can you do when walking standing is so noisy. There is almost no chance to kill an animal with a bow if there is no caller for it. For cape buffalo there is no caller I think. Today I shot 3 times a cape buffalo with a 350 caliber the first 2 from 200 meters with 2.6 meters/sec wind and the last from 90 meters and the animal survived from all encounters with small blood loss. The second and the third shot should be double lung, I saw the shots land for double lung but I received no penetration. There is no way to miss a cape buffalo with that wind from broad side 90 meters away I am sorry but the game is bugged. I could stay here all night reporting bugs on missions, weapons, wasted 217 hours of gameplay. For weapons I think that both 22 calibers are bugged.

It is a nice bonus that many DLC features part of theHunter: Call of the Wild are included in Way of the Hunter for free like vehicles and trophy lodges. I very much enjoy the additional bullet physics and hit information shown upon claiming a kill - the ability to play your shot as it hit the animal makes it that much more exciting. The graphics are excellent without being too demanding and the size of the game on the disk is comparatively small compared to theHunter: Call of the Wild, which is the reason why I bought and play this game exclusively since I have limited storage on my Laptop.

I find that Way of the Hunter is more realistic than theHunter: Call of the Wild which many will see as a positive but I must say, I do miss the more arcade-ish feel. I find that, even though this game improves and modernises upon many features found in other hunting games, I still find theHunter: Call of the Wild the most satisfying game in the way of shooting my shot. Even though Way of the Hunter has a trophy system, It is not as compelling as theHunter: Call of the Wilds trophy system because you have to take into consideration the genetics of the range. It also doesn't help that there is no motivation to hunt smaller game like badgers and foxes since they reward practically no money.

All in all, I would recommend this game to anyone interested in trying out a hunting game. I would argue its the most realistic hunting game on the market.

From the start, I'm on ranger mode without 90% of the HUD and couldn't be happier. Heard management will suffer, I know.
This is good. This is better. With caveats.

Stand Alone Pros:

+++Environment and medium to high distance foliage. (it will make you GPU sweat but there isn't any better long distance vegetation rendering out there). Clouds and lighting are also good. Just missing light bouncing off foliage like in COTW for ambiance inside dense forest. For now, it is a bit dull some parts.

+++Gun Handling and Ballistics. BUT it could be MUCH better with PIP tech on scopes as there was in Red Orchestra 2 (Unreal engine 3) https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=107969840 with very little performance penalty and as it is on Ground Branch....Squad....etc... Instead, currently, the whole view zooms in. PIP could be a game changer because it would open up the possibility to use mil dots and range finding mechanisms on reticles. https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Reticles_vector.svg/800px-Reticles_vector.svg.png

This is how it would look like in the game with and edited picture. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3011254801

Bullets can also ricochet off the ground which is quite insane.

++Animal Behavior. At first, early videos on YT got me away from the game with how animals behaved while fleeing and when startled. Whatever update was that changed that, it was visible on the latest gameplay showcases and finally I felt was baked enough to warrant a purchase. It was correct. It is a decent game but can be improved.

++++Map sizes
+++++Free to do what you want

++++++++++++Ranger mode. A difficulty mode that excludes every visual help off the screen. Making a close to true to life hunting experience. Eyes and ears.


Stand Alone Cons:

-----Heavy GPU usage. I find it troublesome for the game growth on keeping such large overhead on GPU needs keeping a LOT of people unable to have a good time. Not a problem for me, but I imagine it is for quite a few others.

-------Graphical Glitches. Every once in a while there are black geometry artifacts on screen for a frame or two. It is visible on every other gameplay. It is a graphical issue of the game and it is distracting.


Pros Against COTW:

+++++++Proper gun recoil and light scope eye box simulation https://www.badassoptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ELCAN-dual-role-weapon-sight-scope-shadow.png.webp

++++Sounds, but no vegetation collision sound makes it a little dull. What is great is that fleeing animals will make breaking branches in the distance sounds when they go through vegetation and that's very immersive. Also, animals calls are very high quality. 

Gun sounds are tasty and very rewarding. A highlight of this game.

++++Animal movement is better.
++++Ranging binoculars is better modeled. In COTW the ranging laser point is off center.
++++++++++Proper zeroing without the need of a skill (??????? COTW didn't make any sense sometimes)
++++++++++++++++++++++Animals render distance up to 1 kilometre. (I confirmed it for myself seeing a bison at 987 meters)
+++++++++++Much higher vegetation render distance as well as shadows.


Cons Against COTW:

----------Ground clutter up close is lackluster. There is no tesselation or light bouncing technique on the graphics, making dense vegetation seem dull with just shadows and overly dark.

-------------COTW still is better on environment interaction feedback by sound with your character. When you bump in a bush or tree there is a sound and can scare off animals. Every surface makes a different sound in COTW and is very well done, especially with so many different ground clutter modeled there.

--More explanation on each type of bullets. Hunting tier number is not enough to gauge if your bullet will over penetrate. But that's a ranger mode issue as the lower difficulties the HUD will show the hit power in Joules according with caliber x distance.

----------No character customization. Very sad missed opportunity here on making people also grind and invest in cosmetic items for either immersion, showing off in multiplayer and photo mode. Gillie Suits, themed suits and clothes, camo shirts, hats.... it would be nice.


I hope the devs can keep going with this title as it is now my go to hunting game. The previous title I was playing wasn't doing for me anymore for a couple of years now...

Excited for Africa DLC.
8.7/10

Note: After 40h of more gameplay currently at 50h total. You developers from Nine Rock Games baked something incredible. Thank you for the care and attention to details you poured into this. It is been a total pleasure to play this, watch the nature, the animals growing. Amazing.

After many years of playing hunting games and hundreds of hours in Call of the Wild, I have to say this is definitely the best hunting experience available today.  I will pop onto COTW to try out a new map from time to time but I will always just return to Way of the Hunter because the whole experience just feels more real to me.  I could even just use it as a hiking simulator it just feels so real.

First off, the maps are huge and they feel more realistic.  There is so much more attention to detail which means the exploration of the maps is much more enjoyable and rewarding.  There is always a new little hidden gem of a location to be found.  Everything about the maps just seems more alive from the ambient sound to the actual behaviour of the animals.  The first time you make a bad shot and find an animal limping away injured or lying on the ground still breathing but bleeding out will really make you feel bad and think more carefully about taking that shot.

There are a few performance issues that still need to be sorted out but these things take time.  COTW was a mess for quite a while so I can't complain about WOTH after only a year.

You are given some weapons and can earn others. I like the ballistics, the UI options, and the animal base is full and active, and the movements are convincing. They will offer DLCs as well.
Here's the REAL reason I'm sticking with this game: the Devs! They responded to a problem I was having with a mission soon after I posted it; they were very understanding and helpful, several players offering help and suggestions. (It's a physical issue, my fingers no longer have the strength for rapid button pushing, a consequence of advanced age) I will continue to support this game for that simple reason - the devs are present, helpful and involved, and there's really no way to put a price on that.
My first review reflected my frustration with a physical issue - since then, after the impressive response I got, I've changed my mind and corrected my too-quick-to-post review.

It looks beautiful. It sounds great. It's not a buggy mess. There are actual characters with voice acting, back stories and missions. The maps are big and there is a pretty good number of different species of wildlife to hunt. The Alaska DLC map is the best in my opinion of the three available currently. 

Most guns are actual real life guns by Steyer and Remington, and ballistics matter. 

You can adjust the difficulty to make your hunting experience more realistic or casual. 

Is it better than theHunter COTW you ask? Yes and no. With thehunter you have more DLC's and content available, but getting it all will cost you. Way of The Hunter gives more bang for the buck (pun intended) in my opinion as it is now. Both are good games, but Way Of The Hunter has more depth to it and is more immersive with the story missions. 

Is there room for improvement? Absolutely. The NPCs are just voices on the radio. I would like there to be characters hanging around some of the lodges or maybe have a shop to buy equipment in. (Same goes for thehunter COTW, BTW). 

To sum it up. It's a great game, with hours worth of entertainment just in the base game without the DLC. The forst DLC map is amazing in my opinion, and I hope the upcoming expansion is just as good.",1689711018,1689711018,True,1,1,0,0,True,False,False

Tamping down the ballistics nerd in me, I can see even after a short time that this game has potential to rival the COTW and it's freemium brainchild. As others have mentioned, the sound mechanic is annoying but not game breaking in my humble opinion. It's nice that you have to put some thought into your stalk rather than simply bailing out of your Legally Distinct Jeep and blasting away. 

If you're coming from COTW and like it, you'll probably not going to like this, because as mentioned it's quite different and the mechanics you've mastered won't easily transfer over. I, however, didn't really care for COTW (Though I enjoyed the freemium version much more) so I see this as an alternative.

there is no tent equipement that iv seen yet. no pet dog yet, no portable blinds :(
i thought there would be more trophy mount taxidermy poses but there is less as well. it seems.
it seems to be built for consoles. so its a port? and not expressly made for pc?.
(i feel like they need to implement an industry standard for letting people know about console ports heh)
the story is very good and and captivating. im actually really liking it.
i hope they continue to patch and make quality of life updates like expanding the gear and maybe adding a few more features like tents and blind, maybe even fishing.
its a very beautiful game but it feels incomplete.
im still loving it.
edit: i have run into numerous bugs, upon bugs.... feels more like an early access now...
Edit #2 (several day later) : OMFG THIS GAME IS A BUGGY PIECE OF DOG DOO..... ok ok so its not like completely hopeless, but this game needs some serious patching addressing the numerous bugs that make the quality of the game fall off drastically once you have completed the tutorial and begin playing the game. i would be embarrassed to have convinced my friend to purchase this and then explain how he has to now wait until they finish actually making the game playable. which i m which i did....
this is the longest review iv written...
Edit#3 several day after the recent patch......
iv changed back to recommended, after the recent patch a lot of issues have been addressed making the game somewhat enjoyable again. not all bugs are fixed but i m confident they are working on them and will release another patch in a timely fashion.
the fact that they addressed most of the issues so quikely is deserving of praise. i hope they continue this trend and i will continue supporting them.
hopefully final thoughts, this game is beautiful. they really do weather effects well and that adds a lot to the immersion. animal behavior is really neat to watch and the whole system of culling weak animals and saving strong ones to further a better heard is also awesome. makes for great trophies!
really they just need to continue doing great and adding more content!
.....
one year later......
.........

so here we are, a year later. Nothing much has been done. a few bug fixes but there are still too many to list here. its gross really. the experience is very lacking and ruined due to the immersion breaking bugs. and its a game that was marketed for immersion. so that's out the window. my season pass seems to be gone? the one i got with the pre purchase? what the actual fox? i feel like i have been scammed by the over hype and outright lies about this game.
i thought it would get better since the launch over a year ago but its still really bad. as im getting older im getting jaded from pre purchasing anything. im also making a black list of developers and publishers that over promise and over hype and then really a mess of garbage they don't fix. i do understand some games will have a rough launch and need some time to fix things up. but here we are a year later and its still a manure burger.",1660708423,1689389451,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For $20, I really quite enjoy this game. It is beautiful looking and sounding, and I got more out of this game than I expected, as someone who is torn on the benefits of modern-day hunting. I think the game balances nicely between reverence for and utility of nature and turns it into an enjoyable experience for newcomers and (hopefully) vets alike.

That said, this is not a standard ""instant gratification"" game for the most part. It's about choosing your prey and utilizing the wind direction, silent movement, the topography, characteristics of the prey themselves, and patience. But, for me, it does feel satisfying to complete a stalk (sometimes lasting MUCH longer than I realize!) and getting a good clean shot off.

The ""hunter sense"" is a big help for those unexperienced (like myself) in tracking animals or knowing what animals sounds like, or sometimes even what they are -- I'd never heard of a ""lesser scaup"" before! It does make it a lot easier, and perhaps some will feel TOO easy, to track and stalk creatures. But there are options to increase the difficulty.

The story line itself is a bit cheesy, and not really necessary for anyone just wanting to get into the hunt. But it had some good messages and was enjoyable as well. I imagine, to save money, you never see anyone else outside of cutscenes, you only hear their voice. But if that time was spent in making the game loop better, I think it was a very good choice.

That being said, there are some relatively minor gripes/suggestions:
- I couldn't check the freshness of animal droppings in a need area, because the ""inspect"" reticle isn't exact
- Once, a corpse/blood trail disappeared until I exited and restarted the game
- When looking through binoculars, some of the foreground grass looks very jagged, which can break immersion
- It would be nice if need zones that show in hunter sense were a different color once discovered, or if they weren't as bright or something, though this is minor
- Animal tracks to and from need areas don't seem to connect to one another. The tracks just stop somewhere, even when it's not on rocky ground or some place that wouldn't leave tracks. It could just be that I'm missing them, but even with hunter sense on, it seems to be the case.
- It's not immediately clear (unless you check the achievements) that you can't use all of the sounds a caller can make until you unlock them. So I had to take time out to Google why I couldn't switch calls. I don't mind them being locked, I just think it should be a bit more upfront about it.

Overall, I'm quite enjoying this game, for the hunting itself, the learning, and the satisfaction that comes from finishing a long hunt. Money well spent and I have much more time spent in this game that was a lot cheaper than a lot of AAA titles that i played a few hours and never looked back (*cough* Diablo IV *cough*)",1689098589,1689101957,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Very high in details, one that stands out to me in particular is seeing blood trails from animals on branches and bushes.

It's a more realistic sim than cotw. This may be good for you, may not be. It's a great spot and stalk game. It's slower than cotw, and cotw is already a pretty slow game by modern standards. The vitals mechanics are great, the animal lifecycles are great. The core gameplay is there. Animals are ""smarter"" than they are in COTW. Guns and ballistics are just better than they are in COTW. Game looks great.

The problems- 
the story is cringeworthy at best. That's fine, no one is buying a game like this for the story. The problem is that there are just not enough of the fun missions (missions where restaurants contact you for meat orders). A system where these are randomly generated to give you continued content to work on while you're managing your herds would be fun. Additionally, there are none of these missions on maps besides Nez Perce. 

Optimization- I have a 6950XT and I struggle to run this game maxed out on 1440p. That's just silly.

Things I'd like to see added- 
Antler variety- this game lacks a good randomized aspect to antlers like COTW has. Hard to visualize the difference between 3 star animals and 5 star animals sometimes.

Scope reticles- I'd like a proper modern christmas tree reticle so I can do the windage estimation myself without relying on the hunter sense.

A weapon customization system. I'd like to have the option to rebarrel rifles or install chassis systems on them to change calibers or improve the accuracy. Bipods and suppressors would be nice.

Stand/Blind hunting and tents- I'd like tents as a mobile spawn and I'd like to be able to place my own stands/blinds/tripods. Additionally, give me the option to speed up time (not just skip forward) while I'm waiting inside of a stand/blind/tripod. 

More map and animal variety- this one is kind of a gimme. The game hasn't been out for that long. COTW has much more map and animal variety, but that game is fairly old.",1688659838,1688659838,True,0,1,0.485943794250488281,0,True,False,False

Updated (Feb-23): Got back into multiplayer with my friend yesterday and we still had a bunch of issues. The peak was that we finally found a 5 star red deer but my friend could not sell or taxi the animal and we ultimately lost it - very frustrating. Overall key issues include:
= My friend not being able to sell or taxi the animals; then when pressing ESC from the animal camera, the animal disappears completely for my friend and only I can still see it but cannot pick it up
= Stability issues: I had two fatal errors as the host; the session then completely collapses while we were in the middle of the hunt / trying to the collect the trophy; unlike singleplayer when you then reload you are back at the main cabin and once you get yourself to the area of the previous hunt, the shot animal has disappeared
= We then tried for me to join his session; in his session I had the exact same issues not being able to sell the animal / animal disappearing; I also could not hear any noises from the animal but only the noise symbols in the hunter sense; very immersion breaking as my friend say ""oh they are alarming"" and I had not idea
== Overall, multiplayer is still a frustrating experience where the bugs eat a ton of time; it is very immersion and borderline game breaking as you are constantly reminded through either a crash / not being able to hear properly / not being able to pick up animals / trying a bunch of weird workarounds from reddit; I think they really need to fix this stuff before releasing new maps etc; very concerning 6 months after release

Initial review (Sep-22): Great game and I do prefer it to COTW but cant give it a thumbs up until the multiplayer is fixed. Whoever is the guest on the server has significant issues making the game unplayable. Underlying issue is massive desync which leads to good shots missing / missed shots hitting and wounding animals / animals bleeding but not actually being wounded / bizarre bullet camera animations where the animal is dead but the bullet illustration shows the bullet missing the animal. 

In any case - atm this is a singleplayer game only and the devs appear to be working hard to fix the single player; but keep that in mind when you buy (as of Sep-22).",1664485569,1688210152,True,0,0,0.489795923233032227,0,True,False,False

Negatives:

- Herds, and needs zones, are always the same. I know the animals within a herd will change(as I shot them), and that I also can influence their composition by choosing which animals I hunt ‚Äì Herd Management. However, I'm always going to know where those herds are and at which times of the day. This kills the replayability of the game; and I‚Äôm not even talking about starting a new game. In COTW you might argue, it is nearly the same, however, the keyword is ‚Äúnearly‚Äù. There is a lot more randomness and it is really down to how you decide to do Herd Management, that you might choose to not do at all. Both games have an element of predictability, however, it is way worse in WOTH. So much so that there is a web ‚Äútool‚Äù that tells you where are all the need zones and their corresponding active times.

- Hunting pressure is meaningless, all because of the static herds/need zones. In COTW you can completely erase need zones if you wanted to by ‚Äúapplying‚Äù hunting pressure. Also, you can play for very long in a single map, and you always seem to be able to find new need zones, in COTW. As clarified by a moderator, you can cause animals to disappear from a need zone by hunting too much. However, the animals will always return, and meanwhile, there is only one other alternative they could use ‚Äì each heard has only a fixed pair of need zones of each type.

- Difficulty. When you start with WOTH, it appears to be harder, more ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù. Here the biggest complain seems to be centered around the noise system, which, we have been told, it is ‚Äúaccumulative‚Äù. So the sound is added, somehow, as long as you continue to move without pause. This causes the sound or alertness of animals to reach a certain threshold and spook, even at relatively far distances. Once one masters the ability to approach a herd, using cover and ‚Äúdosing‚Äù your movement so the noise threshold is avoided, it really doesn‚Äôt matter if you are approaching a two stars animal or a five stars. In COTW: the higher the trophy rating the harder the animals are. So it is not that WOTH is more realistic/harder, it is simply a different mechanic. In WOTH you have a fixed difficulty, that you can select, for all animals. While, in COTW, the difficulty is according to the animal level. If I had to choose, I prefer COTW. And I know in COTW they basically nerfed this by adding maps with big lakes where you can shoot the harder/bigger animals from a safe non-spooking distance. However, that is always going to be the advantage of finding long range shooting positions, and long range shooting has its own risks.

- Tracking. You only track blood. How hard is to do that or not, it is irrelevant, it is a matter of balancing, for blood tracking. However, the main point is that there is no tracking, tracks, that is. The tracks are there only to show you the paths between need zones. In COTW: you can find any set of tracks and you can follow those tracks and you know those tracks will lead you to a single animal. Even if, as someone pointed out, tracking is not a big thing in real life and most hunting is done via visual discovery and sound clues, tracking has been one of the most satisfying ways to play COTW for me. It was extremely disappointing to find out that I simply couldn‚Äôt do the same in WOTH.

The above elements are key. As they are, as long as I understand them, take me to the conclusion that this game, in its simulation aspect, is extremely basic. It is like a team park where animals move on rails and your prize for shooting the right ones are simple bigger animals moving on the same rails. And no, I‚Äôm not implying that the animals actually run in rails, but the end result is nearly the same from a simulation standpoint.


Small yet annoying elements:

- Walking. There is no normal walking speed in game. The devs have made all sort of excuses. I don‚Äôt buy them. It was a no-brainer, something that the competition doesn‚Äôt do perfect, however, here the issue goes a step back instead of improving.

- Binos. You cannot zoom out with binos. Someone also pointed that zooming with binos in real life wasn‚Äôt also a thing. I couldn‚Äôt care less, this is a game and the competition already has it.

- Save system. A single save file system??? Seriously??? With how criticized was COTW with such system. It WAS a no-brainer too. 1980s software had a ‚Äúsave/save as‚Äù option. Many simulation games have ‚Äúprofiles‚Äù, or ‚Äúcareers‚Äù. Seriously, there is no way to do worst than what the devs decided here. Unsurprisingly, we have started to see the same complain about saves, and therefore progress, completely lost.

- Small game pays very low. Leaving out some of the most obvious examples, like ducks and rabbits. Why the only element considered for credits is the amount of meat?


Positives:

- The map and exploring elements are a strong point.

- In relation to exploring, some areas of the map need to be unlocked, either by doing some missions or by paying ingame money. This is interesting, COTW is known for its slow/unrewarding progression; if it had something like this, it would help a lot to have more fun while leveling up.

- Map environments, in general, feel a tad more realistic.


Neutral:

- Ballistics. I know nothing about the topic. Just from a point of view of a gamer. In WOTH is a little harder to aim. It has the nice animated bullet going thru the animal, but in general I don‚Äôt see any major difference with COTW. I‚Äôve seen some comment about COTW not having bullet drop. I went and tested it, again. In COTW when not using the zeroing perk, arms seem to be zeroed to 150 meters. At 200 meter you see a very low drop, like say you aim for the center(10 zone) and bullets drops consistently on the 9 zone and so on as distance increases. It is harder to test in WOTH, as the shooting range is very limited and somehow the scopes are really bad; we might say the scopes are not as ‚Äúarcadish‚Äù as in COTW. Then I went for the most extreme case, I zeroed for 50 meter and aimed at the 200 meters target. Oh surprise, no bullet drop, at all. Maybe the distance is really too small in both games, at least where comparisons are worth, with COTW limited to just over 400 meters, and with the zeroing option more granular in WOTH, I‚Äôm coming to the same conclusion, not a real difference between the two, in this area.

- Herd management. I think the idea was good, however, it has been implemented too rigidly with the fixed herds and zones. It requires a lot of patience and work with not such a big reward at the end. COTW is more rewarding if you do herd management. You end up with golds, diamonds, and great ones. In WOTH you end with 5 stars vs 3 stars that might pay you more money, but aren‚Äôt much harder to hunt.

- Missions. I simply finished the tutorial and decidedly ignored the rest; besides, the very first one was about hunting birds, and I hate hunting birds. What makes me return to this kind of game is the open world and the ability to do whatever I want; it is why I have over a thousand hours in COTW. But for that the core mechanics have to make sense.

Now, why this game continues to see less and less players? It has nothing to do with the mechanics I discussed at the beginning. I don‚Äôt believe those have been discussed or are known enough. I think it is actually the perceived difficulty, along the herd management system, that takes too long to get results, frustrating players at different stages.

TLDR: if you read this huge wall of text, thank you for your patience!! Otherwise, core mechanics are weird, not a real simulation, difficulty is not so difficult, but it requires a lot of work with little reward. I wish the devs would to something because I‚Äôd love to have an alternative to COTW.",1687818980,1687818980,False,155,6,0.805891215801239014,0,True,False,False

1. You can see animals farther than 430 metres! That alone makes this the better game of the two. Let's continue.
2. With the serious scopes, you can zero from 50 to 1000 metres (in CotW you only have three possible zeroes (25/50/75 & 75/150/300 & 20/40/60), it's pretty arcadey). A few hours ago I dropped a mountain goat with the .338 LM (it's an overkill, but I was after a quest) at 762 metres.
3. The weapons and scopes are licensed. That's always appreciated by firearms enthusiasts like myself. Weapon selection is somewhat limited, but there's no redundancy this way, so I can't complain. In the end of the day, weapons are tools and (at least in a videogame, where you don't care about the weapon's ergonomics, weight, etc.) you only need variety in calibers, not ten redundant rifles of the same caliber that are just cluttering the menus/UI.
4. Terminal ballistics information is available ‚Äî welcome to the normal world of projectiles that deliver kinetic energy measured in Joules. :)
5. A little bit of complexity is added to the blood splatters, depending on what organs and/or blood vessels you hit. Neat!
6. Animal behaviour is described in a useful manner in the encyclopedia. In general, WotH is a way more transparent game than CotW.
7. There are indeed less reserves (three, at the time of writing), but you can pay for a season pass (almost every paywalled thing in CotW is a separate purchase).
8. There is no dog in WotH, but I'm pretty sure there will be (one of the original purposes for the domestication of wolves approximately 30 000 years ago was hunting).
9. WotH also crashes and has bugs, however, there are bugs that can make you mad and destroy something IRL (CotW's invisible hitboxes - remember ruining your shots after hitting a stupid invisible part of a tree/stone instead of what you're aiming at) and harmless bugs (press 1 while ADSing .338 Steyr with the 3-18x Leupold). WotH is more stable (crashes less), but runs worse than CotW, at least on my PC (which is somewhat decent i7/16/1650).
10. Movement in WotH is somewhat faster. Driving (oh, yeah, cars are free) with some nice music radio stations is a nice touch and makes the discovery of points of interest/camps/etc. a little bit less of a chore. Let's face it, hunting games are glorified walking simulators and movement should not feel like a chore.
11. Hunting stands are pre-built and are used for free (compared to CotW where they cost money and their usefulness is debatable).
12. The skills are passive and don't cost money, compared to the questionable ""specializations"" in CotW (and the ""respecializations"" that cost money too).
13. Getting money when starting WotH is not as hard as it is when starting CotW. I'd say is less grindy than CotW (but it's still grindy).
14. The story feels like something out of a TV soap opera, but I don't care much. [spoiler]If River's mom was a real person, she'd most likely have some neurological disorder.[/spoiler]
15. The sound of thunder is pretty cool, but the reverb on the sound effect needs to be tuned way up, I believe. :S

16. What I'd like to see is scopes with true mildots at all possible magnifications (i.e. first focal plane (FFP) scopes), because I'd like to be able to calculate distances based on what I know and what I see. I want both a scope that uses milliradians/MRADs and a scope that uses minutes of arc/MOAs (we must not piss off the imperial users, after all).
17. I want handguns (there aren't any at the moment). :(
18. I'd like to be able to utilize break/pump action shotguns' versatility (there's only birdshot, regardless of the caliber; 12ga, 16ga, 20ga - doesn't matter, you can only effectively shoot birds and hares with shotguns). Autoloader shotguns should have a dedicated load though (because some loads can't properly cycle the weapon).

I'm definitely not disappointed / 1o.
Definitely better overall game design and engine choice than CotW / 1o.",1687693275,1687694138,True,27,3,0.582097947597503662,0,True,False,False

Why did I do this?   I had spotted some mule deer and their young a good distance away.  Spotted them from up in a permanent stand, not far from the stream.  I decided to close on them.  See how close I could get.

Time passed.  The deer kept making calm noise.  They grazed, and gradually moved -- but not in a way that showed alarm.   I kept stealthily pursing them.   Brush in my face.   Close to the ground.   Following their sound and seeing them through the brush,  from time to time.  Trying to get ever closer.  A gentle rain hiding my own sound.  

But then I lost track of them.  No sound of them.  No sight of them.

I started to doubt the game.  I started to suspect that the deer were constantly being artificially relocated if I got ""too close,"" simply in order to ""make it a game.""  So, after seeing and hearing nothing for quite some time, I stood up, exasperated.  It was a silly suspicion and a dumb move.

When I stood, I found that they were just in front of me.  Down at the stream bed.   Very close, previously hidden from my prior angle of sight.  But very, very close.   Yet, not for long.   When I stood, they spooked.  And ran quickly away.

10 /10.  Admittedly, I might lose patience and stupidly spook deer yet again.   But I will never again doubt the basic realism of the game.

Animals are independent agents with needs that they seek to fulfill based on multiple parameters.  White tailed deer and mule deer have similar behaviors, but they're not identical.  Mountain goats behave like mountain goats, preferring the craggy heights and only coming down when they need to drink or eat.  Animals have calling behaviors.  Male and female black bears will call to one another and come together as you listen/watch, and calling in an elk with your bugle call feels authentic.

The terrain is very realistic, and the maps are some of the most natural feeling virtual habitats I have ever experienced.  It feels very much like the real world, with swamps, streams, ponds, forests, meadows, mossy rocks and dense pine groves.  It is truly a marvel on that front.

Animal models are great, and the animations are on point.  In both the real world and this game, I have watched a young deer prance playfully around the herd, annoying the adults.  As a counterpoint, the game is mostly first person, which is a good thing.  If you ever see your shadow, the player model is blocky and very immobile, but that is the only time my immersion has felt broken.

All in all, I've spent 102 hours in the game in only a few short weeks.

Graphics:  4/10
Gunplay:  5/10
Gameplay:  4/10
Developers behaviour:  3/10

Genre: arcade/fantasy first person animal shooting game

 Made by gamers for gamers, Way Of The Hunter is a game where you shoot animals with the help of ‚Äúhigh tech‚Äù gadgets and other tools that can make the process much easier than it would be in a hunting game. The behavior of medium and large animals is highly scripted to artificially increase the difficulty, truly earning the ‚Äúarcade‚Äù genre description. The arcade approach of this game goes so far as to use tracer ammunition (risk of fire in real life) on all rifles.

 WOTH‚Äôs main selling point of being different than its main competition is ‚Äúquickly‚Äù turning around as it seems to be adopting the same exact philosophy. As far as I know, almost a year after release, their promised ‚ÄúMultiplayer cooperative mode‚Äù still isn‚Äôt working properly and since promoting unethical hunting was apparently not enough, with the release of the DLC1 they decided to up the ante by forcing their largely (>90%) male customers to play as a woman (on the new map), who performs exactly the same as her male counterpart.

 While you can still play the game in line with ethical hunting guidelines, you are doing so against the design of the game. Personally I find it pointless to fight against the main game design just to be able to ‚Äúhunt‚Äù, hence my NOT recommended verdict.

 If you enjoy shooting animals with tracer ammunition from hundreds of meters away, using digital gadgets and callers to trivialize the experience, if ethical hunting in general doesn‚Äôt mean anything to you, if you think that men and women are the same, then WOTH just might be the game for you.

 [b][u]PRO[/u][/b]:

[b]-[/b] absolutely zero character customization (MP gives the option to choose between several characters, but still no customization)

[b]-[/b] vehicle view defaults to third person view, every-single-time (showing its arcade oriented core)
[b]-[/b] only one type of ammunition per caliber (developers promised to change this)
[b]-[/b] a list of epic failures on launch, including the inability to set custom keys (later partially rectified - some keys still can‚Äôt be customized though <facepalm>)
[b]-[/b] no separate sensitivity for weapons and binoculars, where you end up with either ‚Äúover-sensitive‚Äù weapons or very slow moving binoculars
[b]-[/b] focus on modern weapons
[b]-[/b] vehicles can disappear from where you left them (even if their icon is still shown on the map)
[b]-[/b] animals can get stuck in rocks, trees and other obstacles
[b]-[/b] highly scripted animal behavior designed to increase the ‚Äúchallenge‚Äù/difficulty/‚Äùrealism‚Äù
[b]-[/b] animals will be able to detect you through terrain
[b]-[/b] medium and large animals are extremely skittish
[b]-[/b] small animals are almost comically easy to hunt
[b]-[/b] small animals can walk through water, fully submerged
[b]-[/b] game encyclopedia lacks a lot of crucial information that players have to figure out on their own
[b]-[/b] no way to field dress the animal you shot (developers said they have no plans to ever implement such a feature)
[b]-[/b] no plans to include a hunting dog
[b]-[/b] almost a year after release, multiplayer mode does not seem to work as intended, even if it was promoted before release as one of its main selling points
[b]-[/b] main platform for discussion and contact with developers is a third party program
[b]-[/b] game design choices seem to cater to a very loud minority (most players are not on Discord)
[b]-[/b] no default fps cap, letting your graphic card run to a ‚Äúzillion‚Äù fps, possibly overheating leading to damage...

But there is one fundamental reason I cannot recommend this game.  After playing it a bunch I have come to the conclusion of how the ""spook"" system works with animal if fundamentally flawed.  No its not a bug, its a design limitation to how the devs coded this game to work. 

So the player has a ""detection"" status.  This is modified by many things.  You the player object, has a scent vector that sparks a spook for one.  Then you have your visibility, which is ONLY modified by stance, vegetation, and I think weather.  This is checked also by your ""sound"" status which is based on your movement.    

The animals then operate on scrips with radius triggers.  At something like 250 yards they start doing ""detection"" checks against you as you try to stalk them.  And its an insane distance that is SO far outside reality of actual animals.  Do you really think animals bug out if they are within 3 stadiums or something uncomfortable?   They then are constantly doing ""checks"" against the player's stat and if you are too high in sound, viability, or the scent vector is on them, they run away about 500 to 1000 yards.  

Know what is NOT part of this calculation?  THE GROUND.   Yes, its not your imagination, the animals really CAN see you through the hillsides.   The game makes no attempt to check for terrain when doing a detection check on the animals.   Thus you constantly, consistently, always end up spooking animals you cannot possibly see at ranges of up-to 300 yards.   Its completely unfair that your prey can see you when you cannot POSSIBLY see it no mater how good you are.  

The end user experience?  You are walking an empty map with little ""sound detected"" bubbles popping up at extreme distances and keep turning into fleeing critters.   You can play for an hour and never get anything in a close range.   So really all you do is wander around, bouncing between need zones hoping to get lucky at extreme ranges.   

I've been having MUCH more fun with that ""other"" hunting game because they are much more generous with the detection radius and animal tolerance.  You still have to stalk, take your time, and so forth,  and you can still be detected through the ground, but its much less severe.  

I also struggle a lot  with the ""Grainy"" look to this game as the shadows use dithering instead of blurring and its AA support is suspect at best.  But these gripes are far less than the big problem of animals having ground earth-penetrating super vision making this game completely unfair.

One of the remarks is lack of animals which is strange considering I walked out the cabin on Aurora (or something like that, can't quite remember the map name) to see a pack of wolves, moose in the distance and some bears (The bears were literally 130m from the cabin). Can only assume these people are sprinting or driving everywhere trying to find animals.

As for the complaints about tracking, you can alter the settings to make it easier / more arcadey so finding your kill isn't a chore. It makes the blood trails REAL easy to follow, should you want that.

[b]Hunter sense[/b] has to be one of my fave features, if something makes a sound / call, it will pop up with a bubble like icon from where it came from and give you information (Species, approx distance, weather they've been alerted or are unaware etc) should you aim at it; such a great idea and gets you actually hunting animals as you will know roughly where they are. Superb feature.

The graphics, the gameplay, the amount of info given after a kill, the maps, the sound and the vast draw distance is outstanding.

Can't stress enough how beautiful the game is, hike up a mountain and the views are stunning! Which leads me to the draw distance..

[b]CotW's draw distance pales in comparison[/b], you wont be seeing any animals beyond 300m in that.. 
Just nailed a Moose just shy of [b]600m[/b] on WotH, can't wait to try an get something even further away.

Overall just feels way more fun and the maps feel alive, thanks to the amount of settings you can adjust to make it more arcadey or realistic, there's fun to be had for all types of players.

Nice to have a hunting game that doesn't just bore you to death.

The only thing CotW does better is that it has multiplayer challenges, they'd be a nice feature to have in WotH instead of only in SP. However it's not that huge an issue when you can just make up your own challenges between friends, lets be honest you don't need a game to tell you to ""Hunt a bear with 3+ trophy rating"" as an example.",1685330067,1685330223,True,10,0,0.568523824214935303,0,True,False,False

Ingredients

For the base

150g/5¬Ω oz digestive biscuits (about 10)
75g/2¬æoz butter
For the toffee filling
75g/2¬æoz butter
75g/2¬æoz light muscovado sugar
1 x 397g/14oz full-fat condensed milk (see tip)
1 tsp vanilla extract
For the topping
300ml/10fl oz double cream
3 small just-ripe bananas, sliced
50g/1¬æoz dark chocolate, melted or cocoa powder

Method

Line the base of a deep 20cm/8in spring form tin with baking paper.

To make the base, crush the biscuits to fine crumbs and melt the butter over a low heat. Pour into a bowl and mix to combine. Spoon into the base of the tin and press down with the back of a spoon until level. Place in the fridge for 15 minutes.

To make the filling, heat the butter and sugar in a small non-stick saucepan and stir over a low heat until combined. Add the condensed milk and bring to the boil, stirring for 2‚Äì3 minutes ‚Äì do not over-boil or it will become grainy and fudge-like. Add the vanilla and pour into the tin. Place in the fridge for at least 1 hour.

Whip the cream in a bowl until soft peaks form.

Arrange the banana slices in neat rounds on top of the toffee. Spoon or pipe the cream on top and level. Set in the fridge for an hour.

Remove from the tin, and zig zag the melted chocolate over the top or dust with cocoa powder.",1685232037,1685232037,True,2,3,0.505917191505432129,0,True,False,False

I've got about 100 hours in theHunter: Call of the Wild and I've been hunting IRL for about 15 years so that's the basis for my review.  This game is definitely much slower than CotW, which means it's closer to a real life hunting experience.  That may not be for everyone but I've really enjoyed the more tactical approach.  For instance, I spotted a herd of whitetail deer but couldn't get a shot on the one I wanted.  I spent the next hour stalking the herd, but I couldn't see them so I used my deer calls to get a vocal response from them, which allowed me to keep tabs on their location.  Eventually they made it to a rest zone, where I was able to line up a shot and harvest a buck.  One hour of gaming to get one animal, yet I still enjoyed it in the end.

In CotW, much of the gameplay amounts to finding animal drinking zones, plopping down tents near those zones, and fast traveling between the tents farming whatever animals are around.  This game does away with the mobile fast travel points, forcing you to work your way from an outpost to wherever you want to hunt.  At first I missed the tents and spawning wherever I want, but I've come to appreciate the act of walking through the beautiful world, finding vantage points, scoping out the area with binoculars, and listening for the snap of a twig or animal vocalization to start a stalk. There are just so many little details that make me think they actually consulted with real hunters in making the game, from hearing animals crash through the brush after being spooked to blood splatter on leaves and tree trunks.

The graphics are amazing and relatively well optimized for what you get.  Another big plus over CotW is being able to see animals render out to around 750 meters versus just 440.  The herd management system is awesome, you're able to cull the less genetically fit animals to raise the genetic average and over time you'll get nicer trophies.

I've only played on the first map and already this game is well worth the money for anyone interested in a very realistic hunting game.  The story is nothing crazy but it's there and you can choose to ignore it if you want without missing out on anything in terms of gameplay.

Only two complaint are the AA in the game is horrible and has to be changed in the engin.ini files. Dev team please fix this. You have amazing graphics ruined by horrible AA implementation.

Also, why are we forced to play as a female in the Alaska expansion? We spent all this time developing River's story and now we have a totally different character. Why was't a female character added but with the option to stay as River and have both characters voices added?

I'm gonna be frank here, I'm a 30 year old male who enjoys hunting games and I would assume 90-99% of the people who play this game are also males. It feels immersion breaking for me to play as a female. Especially when using your fantastic photo mode. So please in the future cater to your audience instead of completely switching up the sex of the character without allowing both options (which should have been available in the first place.) Now every time I want to hunt your Alaska map I have to play as a woman and it makes me want to play it less and less.

This was a horrible choice and the person who pushed for that without adding the option to also be male needs to be fired. This is a hunting game. The vast majority of hunters and especially hunters who play hunting video games are male. I understand having both options for everybody but if it is limited it should be limited to male characters. This game WILL be abandoned if choices like that are continued to be made.

That's just the honest truth and multiple people I know who enjoy your game have complained to me about that choice and as a result play that map much less than the base game.",1683912948,1683959101,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

In ""Way of the Hunter,"" players take on the role of a hunter who must navigate through different environments and hunt various animals using different weapons and equipment. The game offers a wide variety of animal species to hunt, ranging from small game like rabbits to large predators like bears.

The gameplay in ""Way of the Hunter"" is centered around stealth and strategy. Players must use their tracking skills to locate their prey, move quietly and avoid detection, and use the right equipment and weapons to take down their target. The game also includes a realistic hunting experience, such as bullet drop, animal behavior, and realistic animal calls.

The graphics in ""Way of the Hunter"" are decent, and the sound design is excellent, with realistic animal sounds and ambient nature sounds. The game's controls are intuitive, and the UI is straightforward, making it easy to navigate through the different menus and options.

Overall, ""Way of the Hunter"" is an enjoyable hunting game that offers a realistic hunting experience. The game's focus on stealth and strategy, along with its diverse range of animals to hunt, makes it a compelling choice for fans of the hunting simulator genre.

so.... blood trails and animal tracks still vanish, why is this still a thing? i had to wait 15 minutes going back and forth before the blood trail appeared next to my marker, could see it 10m away without hunter sense as well, so clearly a day 1 bug still in the game... this is essentially a game breaking bug that has been here since release, what have the devs been doing exactly?

performance issues... still have not been resolved, frame rates fluctuate by a large degree,i still get frame pausing sometimes when i move between areas or animals mobs spawn in etc.. infact i had more issues then on launch... 

now i also have issues using binos, sometimes it will need me to wait a few seconds before it lets me zoom into my boni view or zoom out back to normal view when i change the direction im looking, like its waiting to load in or back in what i should see when i switch views... one time i taped my right mouse button 8 times with a half second pause each time, before it let me drop my binos... this makes hunting animals rather annoying with binos as scanning new areas most often replicates this issue, im also on updated hardware and a fresh install as well since l last played, so its nothing to do with my old rig being the issue,

water somehow look worse then i remember it... it looks mobile quality... it had visual bugs which seem to have been fixed, but is it just me or did they nerf the physics/effects quality? it just looks bad... compared to everything else its looks like a broken or unfinished asset... i suspect it was set this way to boost performance on consoles... so why no setting to adjust the water to look better on PC? im with everything maxed out and it looks like its from the 2009...

animals are fine tuned to react based on your recommended kill shot distance so you will find they are basically deaf, blind, and dumb until you near this point, adjusted by stance up to a certain point, then going prone actually feels like it backfires as the game attempts to almost force you to take ur shots to what the game devs think is a ""humane"" shooting distances, not actual real world humane shooting distances that are based on the weapon/kit and its ballistic performance as the default guide, because again in real life you can change the optics for shorter or longer shots and the ammo for closer or further shots, more flat shots or more heavy arcing shots that retain ballistic energy better over distance, better penetration, better expansion etc or more hot loads if the rifle is rated for it... this game however ignores all that and simply attempts to make you do it their way, the devs way, not reality... 

if u defy dev logic the ballistic performance of your rifle basically starts to behave like a 9mm pistol at distance and ur zero no longer works correctly for some guns, i found 1 rile always shot a foot high regardless my zero when outside 150m, is this another release bug not fixed? or by design? hard to say with other release bugs still retained, but regardless its clear they nerf your ballistic performance outside the devs  ""humane"" kill distances... so not only do you have to deal with your rifle turning into a 9mm pistol for longer shots, also expect real world kill shots, to cause ""small blood"" trails and a animal that doesnt even die despite a very obvious kill shot... because? animals probably have some kind of reverse engineered plot armor im guessing... either way its clearly intended to try force you to take ur shots at the distances they want and were the animals AI isnt switched off, otherwise its to easy to kill them... makes me wonder if this is how they tweaked performance for console, by nerfing the animal AI at distance and making it more reactive, when it would otherwise have to render in more details if it let u get to close, this essentially limits how many mobs u can get close to at the same time and reduces performance costs... COTW seems to have better animals overall.

im going to play a little more, to get a little more a broader experience on whats changed or hasnt, but yea... cant recommend when its been so long and still has the same launch issues.",1660712272,1683678358,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

for me its better then COTF

great gfx BUT there is a lot of small bugs me, lines in the water, pixelated sky when i move almost grain like and ghosting effects on the birds when they are flying looks like a trail coming from behind,

the map is massive and is great but it does feel empty i wish the devs would add more wildlife in (non shooting animals)
like different kind of birds you always see the same hawk or crow and a flock of goldfinches or what ever they are. get some more wildlife in!

It is realistic but not in a frustrating way.

+You have an impact at the wildlife on your map. If you hunt low fitness animals, eventually high fitness ones with better trophys will be born.
+Animals you encounter will stay on your map in the same herds. So if you find a very promising young animal and let it live it will age and you can hunt it later once it matures into a giant mighty beast.
+Guns are great. There ain't many yet but they are all sounding and behaving very nicely.
+Amazing shot replay camera that shows you precisely what happened to the animal you shot, once you find it.
+There are missions and story that can guide you through the game. They are optional so you don't have to ever touch them.
+You can unlock most of the in game stuff either through missions or by buying it for in game currency. So it is up to you which way you will choose.
+Maps are huge and you can see very far. Distance in game feels quite real life. Animals will render to 800m.

-Story is not anything amazing that you'll remember. But it is fun to do it when you are bored of other things to do.
-Multiplayer doesn't let you progress on your objectives, even if you are the host. So there is little point in it thus far.
-No character/gun customization
-No story on Transylvania map
-Hunting stands are somewhat useless atm

*Edit*  still very much the above just adding to it. I hadn't played much since the initial release, and just wanted to get back into it to give it a fair shake as it is an evolving game and the devs are constantly updating, which is good, but.... in one of their updates apparently my game i had put time and effort into got erased, I didn't realize it until I booted the game and loaded the world which created a new world and immediately overwrote the game saves so I am unable to get back the progress I had. I am not willing to put the time or energy into a game that will delete its game files and over write itself with a simple update. the cloud saves on steam could have helped except I don't know when the overwrite happened. overall a great big addition to the thumbs down. if i could give a star rating for this game id give it a 2, it does have potential but it will be a long time before I try to come back to it.  so far its just a waste of money and I would highly recommend staying away from it for a while until the devs sort this crap out.",1680612487,1681935832,False,31,9,0.574819207191467285,0,True,False,False

Second sentence of that review: neither game is perfect, each has strengths and weaknesses comparably but a few things about WOTH makes it more of a game I want to play.

EDIT: I found something out that people might want to know:  Animals in this game do not leave tracks on their own, like COTW.  That might be a gamebreaker for some people, because if you lose track of the blood spatter from a long shot, you cannot track a big herd by following their tracks.  I would imagine a herd of white-tails crashing off into the forest would make a ton of tracks (like in COTW) and then you can find the smaller blood trails from there.  This however, is balanced out by the herd mechanics, which are super cool and listed down below.

Havent put enough time to really get a feel for how the animals really behave, but I do like that the ruminants tend to walk around larger feed/need areas.  It seems like certain herds are tied to certain need zones and go through daily cycles you can see in the encyclopedia.


Graphics:  COTW and this game each have deficiencies in graphics, in strange ways. COTW AA at 1080p looks too soft to me, but the light and atmosphere are amazing...biggest deficiency is probably the water reflections but it's fine. Animals look great in COTW and I think the devs put a lot more work into that.  Ducks in WOTH for instance are kinda janky looking up close.  COTW also has a better feel for pressing through vegetation IMO.

WOTH has a crisper look to me at 1080p with TAA, which is not always a good thing with all those leaves, but it is also a very beautiful game, but while the water reflections look better than COTW, the moving streams look TERRIBLE.  Ps3 terrible, flat and lifeless with repetitive sprites. But most of the game is not streams so it's not that bad.

Weather: I haven't played enough WOTH yet to have even seen rain, so I can't comment on how that feels, and that's actually a good thing to me. Because conversely, in COTW the weather shifts every day, multiple times a day.  And sure, some areas of the planet are like that, but it seems like they are using it more for atmosphere and dynamic hunting.  WOTH gives you a daily forecast and it seems like more reasonable weather but I have only played a few days of partly cloudy so it will be interesting to see change.  One thing that is kinda neat in WOTH, although unnecessary, is being able to see the spread of your scent on the map. Hopefully different animals perceive smell differently.

Hunter sense: This is a GREAT mechanic for WOTH because you essentially turn it on or off in game, rather than in the menu.  IIRC COTW does not allow you to button-press and turn off the aids.  It gives me the choice to play natural or hardcore at the press of a key.  The animal sounds visuals are dope, as well, and you can see calls as well as heavy movement.

Environment: COTW seems to have a better movement, noise, visibility system, especially the icon that tells you whether or not that bush is really concealing you. The weight system and gear affecting your noise is a nice touch.

Guns: One of my biggest peeves with COTW is how focused they are on DLC and new (unnecessary) guns, as well as making you manage your ammunition and a PAINFULLY shit system where you cannot press, 1, 2, 3, 4 etc and switch to presets.  I have commented on that several times in a review, in discussions, in update comments: but eventually I got disgusted by having to drag and drop and manage gear, especially since that fancy new long range rifle is useless the moment that Bison takes a step over 400m and disappears into the ether.  Some people like to have cosmetics: I dont care.  Some people like variety (I did buy the DLC with the M1 Garand for obvious reasons): I dont care.  WOTH seems to have a better damage model, and scopes where you can set ranges at increments of 50 yards like...a scope...and not whatever the hell is going on with ranging in COTW (only like three range settings? what?).  The ONLY advantage COTW has for me is that you can choose soft-point or FMJ.  But you know what?  Who cares when WOTH doesnt make me manage or purchase ammo AT ALL (you take the gun out with a set amount, reload at a base or your car).  WOTH also doesnt have pistols.  However, I don't care as long as I have what I need to hunt what I want with less hassle: more hunting.

Bows:  If you're a bow-hunter, you gotta go COTW.  WOTH just has a single crossbow in the Aurora DLC.

Tracking: I really prefer how WOTH does tracking. When you shoot an animal you can tell if you hit lungs or flesh, and roughly how much damage. Instead of just a trail of random puddles of blood, the blood also gets on foliage AND the puddles that do occur are more like a trail than a puddle, there is a directionality to them that helps immensely when not using Hunter Sense. However, in WOTH as I mentioned in an update above: animals do not leave tracks themselves. The tracks are tied to trails that inform you of need zones, and scat in the area informs you how long it's been since the animals were at the need zone...so then to track a fresh set of droppings, you follow the ""tracks,"" more like trails, to the next need zone in their cycle.  This means if you miss a shot, that deer is not trackable, but it will return to a need zone eventually. Unless you're in a very open space like Aurora shores and you can just watch where they run to. This all plays into...herd maintenance.  

COTWs tracking IS tied to individual animals/herds, but I was playing hardcore in the frozen north and was tracking hoof prints in the snow on a frozen lake and POP the animals arrive from another plane of existence and it was so heartbreakingly immersion breaking.  The Huntermate GPS tracker than marks sign is cool, but in WOTH I dont need that because the blood tracking system is so much better.

HERD MAINTENANCE: Just learned about this after about 6 hours playtime:  each day is about 1 ""year"" in an animal's life, which correlates to their age range (young, adult, mature).  Trophy Rating is tied to weight.  Herds stay in the same areas, so you can track the growth of a 4 star adult buck to a 5 star mature over the course of days. And genetics matters. Super cool.

Travel, Deployables:  One of the big contentions is that COTW has way more gear, and deployables like tents (where you can fast travel and swap gear) as well as several types of blinds, stands, and even a weird sleeping bag for ambushing geese. HOWEVER. In WOTH you can change out gear at your jeep.  So it's not like you will be walking/driving everywhere all the time.  COTW is vastly superior in this category but...I dont care. The animal visibility trumps all of that.  

Cars: I saw a review that says the jeep in WOTH has terrible handling but I didnt notice that at all.  Certainly scares the critters though.

IN SUMMARY: Neither game is perfect, but I vastly prefer the experience of WOTH.  I honestly don't need anything else than what they've already given me:  a robust damage system, a better tracking system, and long range hunting.  It gives you less ways to hunt than COTW, no plinking with your .22lr pistol, or bows. The only things I would ask the devs for would be to add in a tent that you deploy from your car, or travel to car, add in a compound bow for the people who really need it to buy the game, and make sure that wolves are hunting prey.  Watching a wolf hunt from 600m away would be awesome.

I think that COTW is a better ""walking simulator"" for the people who genuinely want to wander around and explore a variety of beautiful landscapes, or for people who love collecting more gear, more skins for it, yadda yadda.",1681421155,1681498636,True,1,2,0,0,True,False,False

I think it is way better than call of the wild.
One thing that I think would make the game better, and should be an easy addition from the devs perspective: Nightvision.
Adding Nightvision should be quite easy to add and it would provide a completely new layer to the game. Hunting nocturnal animals, that are already in the game, would make a huge difference.
We all hunt during the day but imagine you could continue hunting once the dark falls and get to sneak up on animals sleeping, or find nocturnal ones.

In any case, thank you for making this game! it is super friggin amazing.

After 6 hours of play, I feel like this game while offering some basic quality of life improvements over COTW, doesn't quite scratch the same itch. It feels more arcade-y in a sense but I cant really place where I get that impression from. 

Gameplay: Basically copy and paste from COTW with small changes
1 + the animal tracks are more consistent - big gripe from cotw.
Ballistics play a bigger role in this game but are not very realistic, with the exception of the optimal distance for impact.

Graphics: Vistas look amazing thanks to a more up to date engine and farther draw distances, but everything up close looks a little bland compare to COTW.

Guns and animations for both first person and the animals looks really nice compared.

Overall: I keep fighting off the thought that I could just go back and play COTW. This feels like Diet COTW and not quite as much of a simulation. Its a nice switch up as someone whose played alot of COTW, but if you havent played that one, its def superior.

I can't avoid some comparisons, since I've got around 1,300 hours in CotW, which is the first hunting game I've played. I'd say this isn't better or worse, just different. 

Here are some of the things I've noticed so far (I'm playing in the easy mode): 1) I like that the hunting stands are already built, you just need to find them. 2) I've been enjoying trying to shoot from really long distances as the animals don't disappear once they get over 400 m away. 3) I'd like to be able to carry more than 2 weapons, but on the other hand, the limitation makes you plan things more carefully. 4) The game continues from the spot where you were when you closed it, so it's easy to continue a task that has a limited area. 5) I like it that the first blood spatter tells me if there's no point trying to track the animal, and when the tracks are there, they are very easy to see using the hunter sense. 6) The animal behaviour is what you'd expect it to be. After taking a shot, everything within a large radius flees and stays away, so you need to choose carefully before shooting. 7) The lodge is part of the reserve, not a separate place. So far, I've only taxidermied the 5-star moose I spotted 100 m away from a campsite right after fast traveling there, but I'm looking forward to filling the stands.

The overall verdict is that I like this game very much. I've never hunted for real and don't even know much about guns, so I don't care about realism, I just want to wander around in the forests and mountains and practice shooting. The character could be a bit better climber, but I guess those rifles make it harder than it would be with less gear.",1679397950,1679397950,True,35,2,0.783577561378479004,0,True,False,False

The environment has quite a bit of love put into it. Each zone has its own charm, between mountainous regions, swamps, lowland forests, or fields with rivers running through. Each location feels unique, special, and the hunting quarries vary. Animals travel about the zones, generally stopping at need zones for nutrients or rest. You are given a set amount of ammo by loading at your storage, from here you are free to roam about, or teleport to a cabin/campsite on the map. Let's not forget your trusty jeep, able to take you to and fro through (preferably on wide paths). The pray feels quite fun to hunt, each has its own movements, habitat, and preferred firearm to net the harvest. You can only take two firearms with you, forcing you to consider the best routes and pray to focus on. You can zero your firearm for different ranges, use binoculars to give you information about the target, zoom in with a scope, read the wind/weather, use callers, and hunter sense tells you about animal interactions with the surroundings; These are tools to assist your hunt. Remember to pick a good caller up to lull your pray closer.

Frankly, the quality of the wilderness and the hunts themselves are what has me sold on this game. You have a decent range of rifles to choose from, and the gun play feels fresh and well made. I have to approach my hunts carefully on one of the harder difficulties, and I like the idea that I could change the difficulty as I see fit. The weather system is interesting and changes sparsely. Multiplayer functions quite well and is a joy!

My recommendations for further updates would be hunting tree stands, raised hunting chairs, night vision goggles, infrared scope, bow/crossbow hunting (now added), different fur types (now added), custom map markers, nicknaming trophies, and just more arsenal options in general. Ways to customize your characters appearance would also be great.

It would be amazing to redo the missions lines once you complete them, just without a cash reward. If there is a unique animal at the end, you could be able taxidermy it again, but not have more than one active trophy of said unique mission animal active at a time. I think that's pretty reasonable.

I would say if you enjoy nature, hunting, good gun play, check the game out. Now that most of the bugs have been fixed I think it's a resonable purchase.",1660707392,1678587745,True,2,0,0,1,True,False,False

I have played plenty of COTW with just my right hand, but this game is an exercise in frustration. With so much depending on the Driving, since that is your mobile storage, it's insane to try to drive. L stick steers, right trigger accelerates, so one hand is virtually impossible to do. Being able to swap the sticks might help, as would adding a 'drive toggle' like the walk toggle. The hunting is good, except for the issues with finding a blood trail. An auto mark for animals shot would be helpful.

All in all I do NOT recommend - not for forty bucks+. I will keep it, because I dislike the hassle of returning a gift and I will likely play Multiplayer more, and I may regain more use of my right hand eventually, but I do not think it's worth the price . Second map is dinky. They need to step up their game DLC content big time to make it worth the price. Have yet to see any DLC worth the money spent.

With the Aurora Shores DLC map they added insult to injury. The missions to obtain the stronger crossbow in this HUNTING game **requires** the player to do a 'road race' - completing a course driving the faster, sensitive steering UTV (which must be purchased with in-game currency) to achieve the necessary time. So again, NOT recommended - it's apparently a driving game.  Mzany dubious decisions by the devs and their utter disregard of true accessibility options in their game leaves me wishing I had left this game off my wish list.I should also note that the default character is female in this ma, and her voice / manner can be somewhat annoying.

Dear COTW players, i completely understand where you are coming from! We have lifes to life, families to feed, children to raise and a lot of other RL stuff to do! Our play time hours are far and in between! And when we do have some spare time, we do not want to waste it, by roaming around two RL hours in a hunting game, without not even having a lousy badger to show for it! I understand that. 
WOTH is exactly the kind of game, where this can happen, and I love it for exactly that reason. This game forces you to play the game as intended: realistic. If you don't do that, you will get frustratet over and over again. But if you do, if you enjoy that kind of emersive game play, you will be rewarded over and over again. 
Yes the game had some issues when it came out, but it seems to me, that most of them got adressed. In  my opinion, it is extremely important, to compel game developers to only release finished games! If we don't do that, the bad habits of some game developers will only get worse over time...
At the moment, WOTH runs stable and as intended, as far as i can tell. 
Yes, there is a lot of room for improvement when it comes to in game content and details, but we should realy abstain from the urge, to make it COTW. That would not be an improvement. That would just make it a game, that already exists...",1678484860,1678485683,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am leaving ""Not Recommended"" only for the current time.  I fully plan on streaming this game in the future... and I wish to remind everyone that The Hunter - Call of the Wild currently has a 25 item total package with all DLC here on Steam.

That being said, I might not have been in such a hurry to pre-order if I'd not noticed that this game would have NO ARCHERY at launch.  I am a bowhunter.  I am restarting my Twitch Affiliate stream almost solely around bowhunting... I was going to be playing this game, along with The Hunter COTW, and the upcoming The Angler COTW.

It's got an absolutely GREAT foundation, and I'm actually damned sure that this game will be an absolute masterpiece in the future, but there needs to be some things (READ: Especially ARCHERY) that absolutely must be implemented in order to call this a truly realistic hunting sim.  

The story seems great, and I am going to be playing this game along with The Hunter, and streaming it as well, but in the current state I would advise you to wait before purchasing.  There are definitely some major issues that need to be addressed (inability to set ANY keybindings, no Field of View settings, NO ARCHERY, and several other things that I would think anyone would expect from a top-of-the-line hunting simulator, that is marketing itself as being the first to truly take advantage of Next-Gen technology

It's still enjoyable, but if you're a hunting diehard like I am, things like those major mechanical things in the FOV and keybindings, along with actually immersive things like being able to hunt with a bow, it's tough to say it has passed these first tests with flying colors.

I'm definitely not refunding, and to be honest, I always expected it to need DLC to compete with COTW, but to the Devs, you've got some work to do.

I'll be looking for your Discord server, and giving you some real feedback, as apparently the streamers you had showcasing this game while playing it early this weekend did a garbage job of telling you things that needed immediate Day 1 patches.  It's actually pretty appalling from the content creators.  There are major issues that need immediate fixes, and I only saw one of them criticize a bugged weapon all weekend -- otherwise it was all sunshine and rainbows.

It's definitely a great foundation, but sunshine and rainbows it is not.  

You developers have real work to do, and I look forward to trying to help you make this a true masterpiece.",1660710448,1678450200,False,2,1,0.502074718475341797,2,True,False,False

The animals are much more sparse,  unlike COTW where you can practically trip and find herds of deer or a few moose, or whatever you're looking for. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but what makes it annoying is the tracking system is so finicky. You could be following the tracks of something you shot 300m away, and suddenly the tracks disappear, only to reappear 50m away from where you saw the last track. 

The animals spooking for no clear reason is still a bit of a problem. It's not as bad as it was at launch, but every so often you'll still get alerts that a herd was spooked from the other side of a mountain you were on, even though you weren't even making noise. 

One of the major pain points for me was that animals can die in deep water, and if they do, you cannot recover them. In COTW, the game made the corpse conveniently float towards the shore, but in this game, all animals sink like bricks, and you can't go in anything deeper than chest high water. It got to the point where I didn't want to bother hunting anything at the larger lakes in game because of the risk you take. I lost a good 50% of my kills due to hunting around deep water.

I wish I could give it a meh, but if you loved COTW or want to try a different hunting sim, you'll probably like this, but I'm b netting you'll still be a little annoyed at it's game mechanics.

Way of the Hunter does 'some' things right Call of the Wild did not/could not. But currently, it does a little too much wrong..

Young and Adult animals have one thing in common : they looked like they're being baited high protein diets.. seriously, young animals look buff. It's weird. Now for animal tracking : its lack-luster. Tracks are hard to see due to graphics (see below) and they are basically copy-paste. No real variety nor do they provide any unique information. In fact, there's absolutely NO need to follow any tracks. It's far more efficient to walk, spam calls, wait to see an animal in the distance or hear a call response. Its an element that feels like an after-thought. 

The environment looks great, at a medium distance. They did a solid job with bump-mapping texture..but the environmental graphics are still dated for 2015+. Textures up close are blurry and textures in the distance are blurry. They rely on vignette and depth of field to make the distant graphics look appealing.. but those exact setting cause nausea, eye strain and headaches. And I'm pretty sure the reason why we can't turn those settings off is ultimately because this game isn't well optimized (it's not).

Now for weapons.. there's not a lot to choose from. Seriously. This game currently lacks content. And much of the content there is-is gated behind the WORST part of the game (standby for that). Crossbow ballistics are abysmal. Just absolutely horrible. And getting stuck in the reload animation is very frustrating. All-around, caliber ballistics are unrealistic. And again, there's not much to choose from; especially no option to choose different types of ammo.. Their 'bullet cam' is well done. Not surprising considering some of the devs came from Cabela (known for the bullet cam). There's a few glitches regarding the bullet cam/bullet pathing, but I'm sure they'll polish it out (glitches aren't common).

Now for the worst part : missions/story/quests. They are HORRIBLY annoying. And you are FORCED to do them since not only is a lot of the content gated behind them, they are also the best way to make money. Yup. Be prepared to spend the beginning of your experience with this game knocking out useless quests, rather than enjoying a sandbox hunting experience..

In summary, Way of the Hunter has a good 'foundation' to build upon. But it's NOT a finished game. There's a lot of work to be done, especially optimization to be had.. Their road map isn't very promising as a lot of issues/content players have been asking for attention aren't present on it. And knowing the past work of some of these devs isn't promising.. But the devs are at least active. If you're a fan of Call of the Wild, you WILL enjoy this game. You will understand much of what I have said in this review..""Way of the Hunter does 'some' things right Call of the Wild did not/could not. But currently, it does a little too much wrong.."" What Way of the Hunter does right, is enough to throw $40 at it, if you have the money to spare. Else give it a wait. Also, if you are like me and your eyes are sensitive to graphical settings like depth of field and vignette, I would suggest giving this game a wait until the option to turn it off is added. I currently get about an hour of gameplay in before I have to step OUTSIDE and stare at trees in the distance.. the game makes me THAT nauseated (this is a game-breaker for many players). 

Hope this review helps some folks.. I suggest visiting their Discord for inquiry, and NOT steam's forums.",1678045470,1678045755,True,22,1,0.724357843399047852,2,True,False,False

EDIT 1 (1 WEEK AFTER LAUNCH): new patch has fucked up how animals appear on a scale of young to mature, making it likely youll accidentally cull what was really a high% young male instead of a low% old male. Oh and they introduced a bug that causes bodies to despawn, so you can spend like an hour of time hunting an animal, kill it, run over and the body is gone. FUN. Dont buy for now

LAUNCH REVIEW (AUGUST 2022):
This is probably the best big game hunting 'sim' on the market right now. A lot less gamey than Call of the Wild, hunts are a bit tougher due to a shift in game mechanics. Different devs tho so its understandable.

At the moment theres only two reserves to hunt on but they are huge and even at 36 hours I havent yet discovered all of the first map, let alone started on the second. Plenty of weapons to use, ranging from .22LR and 20/16/12G for waterfowl, .30-30 and .223 for small game like foxes and badgers, .243, 7mm-08, .308 for your deers, sheep and goats and for the big boys like elk, moose and bears theres .300 Win Mag and .338 Lapua Mag. Shooting mechanics are excellent and IMO much better than the way it is in CotW. Much more hardcore feeling. New DLCs are down the line with new animals and two new maps, amongst other stuff. 

Right now its pretty buggy and it will be for a little bit, I've had blood trails disappear while tracking animals I've shot, some animals have weird behaviours and glitch out rarely, and I've gotten stuck in a tree more than one and had to reset to a cabin. However, there have been savegame bugs that cause people save's to corrupt so if you dont want to put in a lot of time and effort into the game for it to be wasted then I recommend holding off for now. I've been fortunate enough to not have that happen, only had 1 game crash in 36 hours so that's pretty good

At the time of writing i probably recommend it about 60-70%. It really needs some polishing and really shouldnt have been released in the state its in, but its got plenty of content to keep you hooked for I'd say at least 50-100 hours with current content. For most people though I'd recommend to saty away for now, wait maybe 2-3 months and maybe a sale too",1661230457,1678012492,True,0,0,0.467032968997955322,0,True,False,False

Story mission with broken invisible textures requiring you to scan pixel by pixel to find the items , if you can find them.  If not no option but to wait for a fix, all the while you cannot do the story mission.

Then they decided this is a MMO/Destiny game and add a jumping puzzle.  Why add a jumping puzzle into a hunt sim.  They still having got the movement fixed so you don't slide about after jumps.

The animal behaviors are pretty realistic and shot mechanics, ballistics, and trophy system are all very good.   So the game is a really good start.

Don't get me wrong, this game looks and feels amazing compared to call of the wild.
But the content it offers is more or less the exact same but with even worse variety.

You have different tiers of guns, but within these tiers, you have the same gun in a different skin in the same caliber in the same tier but with a different price tag.
There's literally no difference apart from just the camo pattern on it.

There is no choice between bullet types.
You are just stuck with what the gun has and you cannot go from for example on shotguns, birdshot to slug to buckshot.

You only have birdshot.

There's no pistols, there's no bows, there's no crossbows.
Only rifles and shotguns at this point of time.

So variety is very little.

Animals are somewhat buggy with their need zones, you can sit there for 8 hours (No joke, did this last night) waiting for an animal to traverse to the zone to drink or eat or rest.
Yes I was this entire time cloaked and made sure that my stench didn't waft in to the zone.
Only for the animals to never appear.
However if you wait till the time is exact at for example 8 in the morning, go to the main menu and back, they mystically spawn in there.

Before that, they don't exist.

Oh and the animals magically heal from shots at times.
Hit a white tail deer at 150 meters 4 times with the required tier gun for it in the lung, the torso, the neck and the butt and it kept going and never died.
From the blood splatters that i followed and then turned on hunter sense, it said it only lost a little amount of blood.

So that's fun.

I already got the game, went past the refund timer so I'm gona keep playing, but for anyone else, just wait a couple of years or get Call of the wild.
You are going to be walking around anyways.

OH and the radio in the car doesn't work and apparently it's a sin in the community to ask for it to work and play the games soundtrack WHICH THE DUDE IS LISTENING TO IN THE BEGINNING ON THE RADIO AND THE YELLOW AND BLUE CARS SPECIFICALLY ADVERTISE THE DAMN THING ON THE RADIO.

Pros:
- It has a nice bullet cam that shows a lot of information
- Decent selection of rifles
- By far the most realistic hunting game
- Top notch graphics and audio
-Plenty of area to explore
- a lot of neat features
- Very large open worlds spread across three maps.
- The story has a good moral

Cons:
- By far the greatest con, this game requires A LOT OF PATIENCE, its a lot of walking, waiting, and tracking
- The story is isnt too good, but it is not bad. The actual story missions are good but it is way too short.
- The ATVs they added are VERY expensive unless they have already changed that
- It would be nice if there was mod support
- It needs more equipment in the game

In short, I think Way of the hunter is more of a hunting simulation, with Call of the Wild being the more robust offering. Of course Way of the Hunter is much newer, and if it takes the same expansion trajectory that Call of the Wild has it will stand on top for me. Whether that happens remains to be seen.

I grew up hunting, mostly whitetails, small game, upland birds and waterfowl in the northeastern United States. Doesn't mark me out as an expert, but I have real world hunting experience to base my views on. Between these two games, I prefer Way of the Hunter in the field. I think it handles several key facets in a more convincing way. Animal animations and behavior, shooting and ballistics, penetration mechanics and herd management. For me it feels more authentic.

There are several difficulty settings, which affect how much information the player has, as well as how alert the animals are. I play on Hunter mostly, occasionally switching to the highest Ranger difficulty. I prefer Ranger for several reasons, but the fact is Hunter just gives me more action, by simplifying animal locating, and crucially, tracking after a shot. It does this with UI cues, pulsing overlays on tracks or bloodtrails, or visual cues to pinpoint the direction animals calls are coming from. Without these UI cues, Way of the Hunter is surely more realistic, and more challenging, but I like to keep up the pace if I can. It's just more fun to be shooting more often and harvesting more animals. At Hunter I find the animals are suitably wary and alert, and gives me a good compromise between realism and enjoyment. 

Way of the Hunter has a neat mechanic that shows impact energy in joules, and as long as you aren't on Ranger difficulty, you can see this prior to taking the shot, showing you the estimated energy at impact and whether that is proper for the animal you are targeting. Each animal is rated with a range of proper energy, and your task is to match that and take the game cleanly. And with this energy displayed you can see in real time how wind and range affect the ballistics. Your .308 might be delivering 3,500 joules at 150 yards, but that might drop to say 3,000 at 300 yards. So the range to the target plays a big role in which cartridge is ethical.

Pretty cool, and this ballistic modeling I prefer over Call of the Wild, which feels more formulaic and less dynamic. Both are satisfying, but Way of the Hunter feels more correct based on my shooting and hunting experience.

Weapon selection is fairly limited at this stage, but it covers most of the key types and calibers. Rifles and shotguns only so far, with crossbows coming when the Alaska reserve releases later this week.  Carry limit is two weapons, which is more restrictive than Call of the Wild where you can carry five or six long arms easy.  I've never hunted carrying more than one weapon, and I've never known anyone who does (except maybe a sidearm), so even two weapons is generous in my view. These weapons are divided in to tiers, as are the animals, and matching the two is the key to hunting ethically, along with shot placement.

Way of the Hunter is heavily invested in promoting hunting ethics. For me I found it a bit heavy handed, and before too long I was thinking ""yeah I get it"" as another reminder was given through mission descriptions and notes you find. I imagine the devs are keen to ward off ethics complaints, and this approach gives some cover I suppose.  I think if my state government had been producing ethical hunting educational material for fourth graders in the 1970s it wouldn't be all that different from the approach in Way of the Hunter. Others may find it charming I reckon, and the moments pass quickly so I won't dwell on it. Just my opinion.  I fully buy in to the ethical mojo, always using the right cartridge, targeting vitals, never shooting at running animals, and rarely at females. I just prefer not to be encouraged to do so, so often.

Herd management in the game is a shadowy concept, essentially compressing generational effects in to a few days. Harvest the oldest and weakest animals and you might increase the chances they are replaced with others that go on to achieve five-star status. I half-heartedly buy in, targeting the weak and the old when I can, and allowing the most promising to pass in hopes we meet again when they've reached their potential. It's a neat concept and makes me feel invested in my reserve, but I don't take it too seriously either. Five-stars will exist whether you cull the proper animals or not, but with a considered approach you can increase the numbers and therefore your odds of finding one.

Two reserves are in the game, with the third as mentioned coming in a few days. The first two are massive,  at about 55 square miles, and the Alaska map is said to be half that size, putting that reserve around the same size as those in Call of the Wild (and meaning the original two in Way of the Hunter, Idaho and Transylvania, are double the size of those in Call of the Wild). I think the visuals and terrain in both are simply stunning. There's enough variation through each to keep it interesting, from marshlands, to lowlands, uplands and mountains. Open fields and thick forests, rivers cutting the land. Weather effects like fog and rain.  Top marks for the reserves. I expect Alaska to maintain this high quality, and hopefully many more down the line.

But it's out in the field when I find Way of the Hunter does it's best work. I stalk 99% of the time, always very slowly and upwind. The animals are alert enough to be challenging, and alert enough to punish the clumsy or inattentive hunter. Patience is a virtue, and anyone who doesn't have it should probably look at other games, or at least drop the difficulty to make the animals less wary.

In that comparison to Call of the Wild (which is six years older, mind), Way of the Hunter comes up short in many ways. Number of reserves, types of animals, number of weapons and weapon types (bows, muzzleloaders, handguns) and gear (night vision, tents, stands, blinds, decoys etc).  But in the field, Way of the Hunter hits the right notes for me. When it just boils down to me, my rifle and a whitetail, it's Way of the Hunter that gets closest to what I want from a hunting game, and closest to the experiences I've had doing it for real.

Games like this are difficult to recommend, as I think it takes a certain mindset to find it suitable.  But if you are the type of player that wants the most authentic hunting game on the market, and if you have patience and can embrace a slow burn I don't think there's a better hunting simulation out there, even if I use the word simulation loosely. I play and enjoy both games, but Way of the Hunter is my preference once the boots are on the ground. And if the devs keep expanding it, and listening to their customers, it will surely get even better.",1676825435,1677007049,True,160,2,0.923075735569000244,5,True,False,False

The first reason is the painful lack of fast travel options. There are a handful of fast travel locations (lodges, campsites) scattered around the reserves, but they are relatively few and far between, as well as being much more difficult to find than in  COTW (sorry, but the direct competition is obvious). This means that when I log in to play and I want to just go hunt elk, for instance, I may have to get in a jeep and drive 10 irl minutes, followed by another 15 minutes of hiking to reach a place where elk are likely to be without spooking them. I find this to be quite a drag if I pop in game and go for even an hour hunt. It feels like I spend most of my time traveling where I want to go. 

Next is the honestly awful bird models, animations, and pathing. With the somewhat new COTW waterfowl rework, especially, it is painful to hunt birds in this game. Since fowling is one of my favorite things to do, both irl and in COTW, this really takes the game down a notch for me. 

The last thing is the graphics. They legitimately hurt my eyes. I am honestly not sure what it is about them, maybe the graininess, maybe a lack of contrast, but this game seems to strain my eyes the worst of just about any game I have played. I get that in real life, animals blend in to their surroundings, and I know that it makes it more realistic to make them like that in game, but the added strain of staring at a glowing screen while searching for an animal that is as hard to spot as irl puts a bit too much strain on my eyes. 

Besides the aforementioned items, I legitimately like the game a lot. The ballistics are very cool, the animal models (except fowl) are great, the audio is great, the massive render distance vs COTW is amazing, and the story is far more compelling. For now, though, I am just not very compelled to play.",1676958384,1676958384,False,4,1,0.485101312398910522,0,True,False,False

It's less tedious to play and the animals feel (to me, I've only been hunting once irl, but I live near a lot of wild animals) like they respond a little better than they do in Call of The Wild. This game also runs infinitely better so far. The draw distance is massive, like, I've spotted animals from hundreds of meters away.

The audio has a couple of issues, like footsteps lingering half a second after you stop walking, or the water not making any sloshing or reaction sounds when you walk in and through it.
The game also has a slightly limited selection of firearms so far, but that's fine. It's still playable and they still have enough variety for the different needs that you'll have hunting.

[h1] Vary realistic [/h1] 

honestly i had doubt at the beginning but played for 6 hour's, and for what i have seen so far, is the realisim factor of the game 

ive been the hunter call of the wild play since they came out, big fan but im 99% sure im gonna swap to this game now because of the realisim this game is newer then the hunter but has little to no bugs like the hunter has, 

i like how deers and other animals are not every 5 feet you walk, and i like how the animals dont bug like they do in the hunter 

i 10000% recommend this game to who ever wants a vary realisistic hunting game, its vary realistic to real life

the tracking is amazing so is the hunt vary well worth the price 
it is vary cheap price for an amazing game like this

This is by far the best hunting game i have played to date. 
The movement around the map does not make you feel like you are walking 100 meters an hour and still managing to scare every animal away. It feels closer to what its like IRL
You can adjust the hunting aids to your own liking, so you can read the tracks realistically or more arcade like. 
The gun play is what you would expect from unreal engine, wind and bullet drop at longer ranges factor in.
The way the projectile energy is calculated as it passes through certain organs is incredible.
You can also see in detail the temporary wound channel and a 3D model of where your shot landed and what vitals it hit.
Way Of The Hunter also encourages ethical hunting practices which i quite like, as well as showing the importance of game management through culling and monitoring genetics.

I do like the ageing and genetics system of this game, I won't deny that that's pretty cool.  I do like the  aesthetic they do for blood trails, especially with blood getting caught on branches that the animal crashes through, and I am a fan of the trophy lodges, although I do not like the fact that we can't change the poses of the mounts, or being able to see the scores on the trophies (although I'm open to the possibility that I just haven't noticed how to do it.  I also really appreciate the fact that ammo is pretty much free...that's amazing, never change that. 

That being said though, there are some things in this game left to be desired.  I mentioned the trophy poses, but that's one I can live with not ever seeing come to the game.  However I admit that one of the reasons I have waited till the game was 6 months old before I even bought it was the way some of the animals look as well as the lack of rares.  I hate to make comparisons between games, but  I have to here for things to make sense.  Let's start with rares...COTW is superior, they gave all the animals rare fur types right away if I remember correctly.  Don't get me wrong there are rares in Way of the Hunter (my only trophy so far is a melanistic mule deer buck), but there's a lot to be desired still as well as true racks.  Another thing that kept me away from this game was some of the animal models.  Some of them like the Elk, Bighorn Sheep, Mule Deer and Wild Boar look amazing, but a lot of the birds, the Moose, and Mountain Goats in particular look a little like a mixture of the real thing, PS2 models, and sock puppets.  

However, probably the biggest thing that kept me from this game as long as it did, was really the lack of new animals to hunt compared to COTW. To be fair, COTW has it beat by almost 6 years now, but still, when Badgers, a Scaup, a Goose, and a new Jackal species are the only things here that I can't already hunt on COTW, it makes me lose some interest, and that Alaska DLC that was announced two days prior to this review is not helping things (although they haven't revealed all the new species at this point so I'm at least open-minded enough to believe that I could be surprised).

In addition, I know that they were technically DLC in COTW, but tracking was definitely easier in call of the wild with the help of bloodhounds.  I know there's a hunter sense, but let's face it, their not exactly the easiest thing to see sometimes, especially if you made a bad hit.  The game has a lot of potential and is good for what it is.  However like I said at the start, it needs a lot of work before I call it better than Call of the Wild.  Because right now it falls under COTW for best hunting game I've played (and I've played a lot), even with that game's arcade feel.  To be honest, unless some major changes get made, I don't even expect it to beat Ultimate Hunting either, and I've been following that game closely for almost a year.",1675558091,1675558091,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Game is a diamond in the rough in many ways, best advice if you're new, try to find need zones like water, analyze the entries in the games menu for the animals schedule and work around that as a start, running around+shooting you will spook stuff, and unlike COTW where you can easily fire off 2-4 shots before the herd makes a break for it.
 
This game you'll be lucky if you can get 2 before they make a run for it and then the tracking part of the game begins (CSI style follow the blood trail, complete with directional blood droplets, pink blood for lung shots etc).

They've been doing better with bug fixes/issues e.g. the obnoxiously loud wind howling sound, but could do with some more tweaks to animal behaviours e.g. aggressive bears, maybe animal stalking behaviours to switch things up, make you feel less like the Main Character and more like just another actor on the stage but thats just my opinion

Honestly, if you want a grounded hunting sim, pick this, you want a hunting sim with oodles of content and realism isnt a huge issue, Call of The Wild, if you want a game where hunting is kind of a side hustle to the main game itself, id say Red Dead Redemption 2, at least thats been my experience.",1675408196,1675408196,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros: Animal behavior, animal movement, weapon ballistics, and everything including the natural state of what hunting is and how it works. 

Cons: 
1. It lacks any character customization
2. It lacks a larger selection of gear, I.E., it lacks any side arms/archery/black powder/ big game loads for shotguns.
3. It lacks aggressive predators. Now I'm not asking for a Dangerous Hunts style of aggressive, but, when you're hunting bear, or wolf, there needs to be a bit of nervous fear factor to it. A bit of hunter becomes the hunted action to it. 
4. The ballistics need to be tweaked for the 338 Lapua so that it has the same hit marker size while under Hunter Sense. It should not be bigger than the 308 when the ballistics for 338 Lapua are one of, if not the highest for long range accuracy and precision in the real world. Same goes for the Remington Chambered in 300WM. Why is that one so big but the Steyr SM12 is so much smaller?",1674839712,1674839712,True,13,1,0.626338660717010498,0,True,False,False

Every one of the problems I mentioned has since been patched, and I now find the game to be enjoyable. There are still issues, but it is clear that the devs are committed to taking player feedback and improving the game. It's a damn good hunting simulator.

My initial review:
My first impression of this game is that it feels unfinished. Can't rebind controls. Can't change FOV. Graphics look pixelated, even though they're maxed out. Short list of weapons. Some animal and character animations look rough. Multiplayer is buggy and runs poorly--this is how my friend was stuck after exiting a blind: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2851418133 And all this was just after 2 hours of game play. I know they've already stated they're aware of some of these issues, and are going to patch them, but it just proves the point. It honestly surprises me that it's not labeled as early access.

All that being said though, I'm going to stick with it. I'm hoping this game will turn out good after patching. It's just really disappointing that it needs it.",1660970554,1674620156,True,0,0,0.517045438289642334,3,True,False,False

In Way Of The Hunter you actually have to put in the effort, and find these creatures, call them in, and be careful about how you approach it. Not only is it better at hunting, but the animals are beautiful. Their models are so realistic and just capture the beauty of nature.

Nine Rocks and THQ Nordic hit it out of the park with this one. Graphically, the game will have you at a loss for words, story-line is a little lackluster, but is made up for by the authentic hunting experience. As a real life hunter, this game is damn near lifelike in terms of animal movements, looks, behaviors, terrain in which they dwell in, and reactions to being shot, are as about as real as they come. 

That being said, I do feel like weapon selection as well as the 2nd map (Transylvania) could use a little work. No bows released with the game feels like a real missed opportunity ( though I'm sure they will be added in the future) Transylvania feels desolate, and almost feels added to the game as an after thought ( maybe I'm just not playing enough on it but Nez Perce Valley is superior in my opinion)

- UI missing elements
- Tracks, urine, blood tracks and animal sound tracking often missing or partly missing / not showing up or incomplete.
- Non Host player can't climb ladders (consistently) 
- Unable to interact or sell a kill resulting in the animal disappearing without being given credit.
- Deer in the main menu imported straight from Pac Man 1980. Like seriously, what happened... Did you cut it by hand with paint ? The thing is horrible. 

Basically you can't play the game. I was a video game tester many many years ago and I will tell you that a game should never release with progression blockers like this. This is absolutely mind boggling. 

BUT THANK GOD WE HAVE RADIO IN THE TRUCK NOW. 

I started with the embarrassing stuff but I will now talk about the better points. 

Single player seems to work fine and many of the issues listed above are not happening in single player mode or as a host of a server.

Graphics in game are very good. Not breath taking but good enough to please the eyes.
Gameplay is good, I enjoy the hunting mechanics and the reaction of the animals. I'm a novice hunter so I can't tell if everything is 100% accurate but it seems pretty decent from what I know personally. I wish there was some physics in the water with vehicles and on foot. It just seems to be a reasonable thing to expect from a game like this. Menus are decent and I can see someone spending hundreds of hours hunting in this game. I've spent 16 hours as of this review and i have barely scratched the first couple zones. If they keep the maps coming I can see the replayability be very high. Overall I think the game is good, but just like many other games it feels a bit unfinished. I feel like it could have used another couple of years of development but I also feel like the studio wouldn't be able to deliver anyways. It's just one of those games where they did all they could and it is what it is. Take it or leave it.

Graphics are stunning, and the sound design and ambience are engaging and enthralling.  I spend as much time up in a deer stand just watching as i do actively hunting.

Game play is good balance of realism and fun.  For me the highlight is the ballistics.  Shooting feels very natural and real, not sure if it is hitscan or not in the code, but it certainly doesn't feel like it when you play.  Blood trails are also a step above anything else i have played, with the directionality and colour meaning you can track (with some time and work) without using any of the hunter sense.


if devs are reading, there are a few things i would add which would make all the difference to me and i am sure many others.

I will start with small things!

- Add a decal on the animal where the shot hit.  wouldnt do much apart from 1) add to realism, and 2) let me know through the scope where i hit, and if a follow up might be needed,
- add a little dynamic movememnt to called animals, at the moment they seem to bee-line straight towards the caller at a pretty zombie like state.

- Would also like the ability later in the game, to erect blinds and stands in spots i would like.  would also give something to spend late game money on!

Now the big ones!

- Ballistics seem very on point to me (a bit of a gun nut) and i love the addition of the pressure cavity in calculating the damage, but i would love to see some more post penetration physics implements.  Bullet fragmentation, and expansion plus bone shattering and causing additional internal damage as happens in real life.

- Finally, a change to the animal movement depending on where shot.  Eg. if a bad shot hits a leg or shoulder, seeing the animal move away unable to use the injured let would be a big realism addition for me.

Over all love the game, cant wait to see what more comes of it!

Its really fun gameplay. Its about as fun as Hunter CotW but feels way fresher and less clunky with on the controller. 
It looks gorgeous. Graphics are way better in this game.
Blood Tracking is decent once you get the hang of it. Can track medium blood trails pretty easily. Tracking foot prints or other signs less reliable. Hunter CotW is a little better overall with its tracking system, being able to level it up and tell the sex, weight and health of the animal being tracked is a nice feature but not a huge deal. They also still need to add in rack variations but they did add in different fur types. It gets boring seeing the same racks on deer over and over though. But this game is still new and is still being actively developed so hopefully these feature will appear in game at some point.

They did add in difficulty settings but the game is easy enough on default.
One feature this game has that is cool is herd management. Being able to cull low level bucks to grow a healthier gene pool so you can have herds with consistent 4-5 stars is another layer of gameplay that keeps me entertained longer.  

Another thing i love about this game in comparison to The hunter is only 2 massive maps but dozens of animals to hunt on each one. I didnt have to buy a TON of DLC, just the deluxe edition which came with the season pass.
You dont have to buy licenses for animals and you dont have to constantly travel to new boundaries and setting up a new hunt and starting point everytime you wanna hunt a new animal. This game makes it all simpler and more fun. Its fast and easy to fast travel from your lodge to campsites or cabins. 
I dont have to worry about how much weight im carrying or how much noise it makes. 
There is no tree stands or blinds. No decoys. There are hunting stands and the animals are very responsive to lures when in range.
This game makes alot of things simpler and more fun in that way. 

The game also has a nice tutorial to get you started and doing missions and objectives gives me incentive to keep playing and exploring further out. Its a huge map, very gorgeous. Runs pretty good.

But time passed and I picked it up on the Winter Sale, and I gotta say I love it. I have hundreds of hours on Call of the Wild across multiple platforms, and that game is very good as well. It appears that the playerbase is split between the two, with many more playing COTW. However this game scratches an itch that I didn't know I had after all the COTW hours. 

In my personal opinion this game is better than COTW, I prefer the realism and difficulty of this world much more. Especially whenever COTW turns into a shooting gallery at some points when you are farming trophies. Way of the Hunter is a great take on the hunting genre, providing beautiful graphics, licensed firearms, a incredibly detailed genetics, and fitness system that influences the species of animals on the map as you hunt them. It also has a solid narrative that I preferred over some of the COTW map stories. Way of the Hunter has two expansive and gorgeous maps with a plethora of species to hunt as well, providing you hours of content trying to find those perfect trophy animals.

It isn't perfect as it does lack in a lot of ways to COTW, even if I do prefer WOTH better. It doesn't have tree stands, tents, or any forms of blinds or cover to place. It lacks purchasable animal scents, or scent masking sprays. It does have very impressive callers though for the animals. It lacks any form of archery, but I'd imagine that it will be coming soon. They just added rare fur types as of today, and a radio to your vehicle that players were requesting, so it is nice to see the devs listening to player feedback. I hope they stick with it. 

I would rate this game a 7/10, it could go as high as a 8 or 9 if some of the bugs are ironed out, and more hunting equipment is added such as the scents, and archery that I stated previously. I am looking forward to the two new maps that are coming this year, and can't wait to see what they do with it in the future. I recommend picking it up if you are looking for a different experience to COTW. They are both great games, and it is nice to have a competitor in the hunter game genre that can push COTW to innovate more, and vice versa with this game her.",1673367113,1673367164,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Then back in the day around 2008 I got myself Deer Hunter 2005 which was already a very inspiring game for me. I was hoping that they would make more and better versions of such games and oh boy what do we have today. 

It was around 2015 maybe that I tried The Hunter Classic. Liked it but did not like the way you had to pay for it. Then around 2020 I tried The Hunter Call Of The Wild and fell in love with it. Just hoped that more such games would appear and also with little more realism and I have to say Way Of the Hunter is quite exactly what I have been dreaming about. 

Okay, the game is in its early stages so there is lot to get better. Been having some graphical issues (minor though) and some funny moments seeing animals get stuck etc. The biggest issues in gameplay for me has been that spotting doesn't always work like charm and sometimes it can be hard to track bloodstains. So sometimes a little frustration can come but on the other hand I just need to learn to shoot better ;)

Nevertheless, the most important thing in my opinion is already there to be experienced and that for me is the feeling that developers are serious with this and clearly trying to achieve realism. I'm by no means a ""pro hunter"" and I do play at just ""Adventurer"" level but even so I do get the feeling that I'm on a hunt and I need to pay attention to what I am doing and how environment interacts with me. 

Also this game has managed to get me more inspired with guns and also learn new things about different options with guns. I've been on the verge to get myself some guns and maybe even some that would need licence and now it is just even more tempting. 

If I think about the future of hunting games and sims, it's easy to get excited about playing these games in VR . Maybe we get there one day, but until then I absolutely do recommend playing Way Of The Hunter, It is already giving some great hunting for us today!",1673220448,1673220448,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have 500 hours on The Hunter Call of the Wild...just for context.
Ok This game suffers from a lot of the same issues COTW did when it first came out. The tracking system is pretty terrible. It's hard to see blood and I have had blood trails just disappear. I know because I always mark the first blood hit with a x through my binos. I lost the trail and went back to the start to find no blood there at all. The perk system is also pretty bad. You dont' get to level up with any choice you just do things like walk so far and you get a new perk. It is also really hard to find animals other than in open settings. The woods are simply too thick. Open fields will find you animals. Slow to start animal payouts are low...low low...so you will have to slowly save up for new passes to areas. You don't get full access to any animals you want as soon as you start. The biggest annoyance to me is the lack of gun shop at any other cabins..this means you have to teleport back to main lodge to get more amo. Night time is terribel as well ... can't see a damn thing so no point in trying to hunt...and god forbid track at night. This means you have teleport to a cabin to sleep. no sleeping in your vehicle. So again slow tedious lack of thought into the save, buy and sleep options. COTW had the same issues until they came out with the tent system. I dunno. 12 hours in and kinda bored. I was hoping it would be more polished on release and at least allow full access to hunt any species.

60 hours in and just tried multiplayer.
Lets just say this is a buggy mess in terms of multiplayer. My Brother and I tried to play a game I hosted and he joined. At first he called a vehicle and could get in. I could only get in when he was in. Fine...but give it 5 minutes and now he can't get in...and because he called the vehicle I can't get in either. We are now walking. Jump back to camp I grab a vehicle. He can't get in. Fine ride on the roof. He does and we drive around so he can shoot game from the top of the jeep. Funny but buggy. He gets no money for any animals he is shooting in my game. He claims a moose and there it is still lying on the road after he claims it. We are both hearing different sounds of animals from the exact location beside each other. I take him to a camp he has not unlocked. He can't unlock it. WTF. Half baked unfinished crap.

Like so many others I came to this game via Call of the Wild, and Way of the Hunter has impressed me, but also left me wanting more. To get the negative out of the way first, this game has some notable limitations, firearms are extremely limited and equipment is essentially non existent, you get some callers and binoculars, and that's it. No functional or cosmetic clothing and no hunting gear like portable blinds. This game stalls essentially right out of the gate when it comes to meaningful upgrades. Perks are earned by doing, which is good in theory but some of them like the prone perks are a serious grind. Lastly the game has its share of bugs, some of them are not super impactful such as foliage sometimes taking upwards of 2 minutes to load in after fast travel, but others can ruin the game, like a critically bleeding animal suddenly no longer leaving a blood trail. I hope the devs can keep adding to this game and address these shortcomings.

Now for the positive, this game is gorgeous, from the environment and foliage, to the animal models and the way they move. Moreover, this game achieves something COTW never did for me, which is make the world feel like a real nature park, animals can actually be spotted from large distances, herds are seemingly more persistent and impacted by your actions, and animals are rendered realistically and can actually be noticed amongst the foliage and trees, something I always felt COTW struggled with. Graphics in this game make a huge difference. I also can't quite put my finger on why, but hunting itself feels better in Way of the Hunter, it feels more organic and animals react in a much more authentic way to your presence.

The animal AI is excellent, and a lot different then The Hunter: Call of the Wild.  However, I must say, that I often play multiplayer, online with friends, and this one has quite a few glitches compared to Call of the Wild.  All in all if you've never played a hunting game, get Call of the Wild.  Otherwise, this one is a beautiful addition to scratch your hunting itch.

The tracking system is very hard, and I'm sure it's because they were trying to make this more like a simulator.  However when I go virtual hunting it's for relaxation with the once or twice an hour epic animal trophy.  Tromping through the woods for hours, spooking the animals indefinitely gets old, and sitting and waiting... well.... that's just lame.

This game is COTW and The Hunter Classic killer. It is simply better and has a lot more  of potential. Especially those whose can't withstand the graphics of the hunter classic or want a simply better game than Call of The Wild. 

If it is your first hunting game I recommend you play on the lowest difficulty. If you played COTW or Classic before try playing on the second lowest difficulty so you see how much this game is better made and more realistic in general.

The graphics, particularly the AA is terrible, there are the occasional bugs, and there is room for improvement gameplay wise. That however does not mean it is a terrible game. 
This is by far one of my favorite hunting games compared to COTW or hunter classic. The story I find much better than those found in COTW. Unlike how every map is just helping out some old dudes jpeg image to clear a certain forest area of insert species here, you have orders to fill for local buyers, if you want of course. On top of that, there is a full story and background as to why you are there, what you are doing there, and why the place you are at is the way it is. Its a touching story, without being cheesy or a sobfest, and still focuses on the core gameplay. There are very few missions where you run around doing pointless tasks like in COTW. There are a few issues here and there however that are good to know before buying, but many will be fixed or implemented soon, according to the devs roadmap at least. Currently, there is only a small selection of shotguns, and no bows, handguns, or muzzle-loaders for that matter. 
On top of that, what you do have, you cannot select or buy certain ammunition, it is all locked to the firearm when purchased, and refills... somewhere, I haven't figured that one out yet. That however, is all set to be implemented, from more firearms, to different types of them. Alongside this, the new firearms are to be licensed, like so many products in game already are. This is one of my favorite parts, that I actually have heard of and possibly have used some of the firearms in real life. On top of this, It is planned for different ammo types, and the ability to select those ammo types, to be introduced. Many of the aspects lacking from the game, have been acknowledged by the devs, and are set to be put into the game.

A lot of walking and crouching which is really nice when sneaking up on your prey. (Except I'm not use to it because I'm from Texas where baiting is legal unlike majority of the states where baiting is not allowed whatsoever.)

The anatomy of the animal seems to change very slightly in the Young, Adult, and Mature kills on big game hunters which does mean a lot when you're going for the heart shot.

1.Visuals are bad. It just doesn't look that beautiful when you are coming from COTW. Not to mention the anti aliasing just doesn't match with this game. Tried every version and they are all bad. Trees look bad too so overall visuals are bad and glitchy like guns not loading high quality versions of them in shop menu.
2.FPS is bad. With 3080 and I9 9900K with 32 gigs of ram and game installed on ssd, I get 80 frames. so it shows how optimized it is.
3.Animals are not challenging to kill. They are dumb compare to COTW. I managed to run towards deers all the way up to 120 meters and they only went to alert stage. It might be more realistic this way but considering I have to crawl for 20 minutes in COTW, I don't know why that game is called more arcady compare to this one in communities.
4. There is not enough guns. Only few bolt actions and shot guns. Again in COTW we have bunch of rifles, dmr, bows, crossbows, pistols, air gun and etc.
5. This one is the worst and the reason why I won't play it anymore. Tracing system sucks. It's harder than real life. you could stand literally on the other side of the bush that has the blood trail on it and not be able to see it even with your hunter sense. Unless you are willing to waste your life like it's the real thing and search for your kill for hours. I play these types of games to chill out, not to look for ghosts for hours. I have no idea why devs took this decision. At least make the blood more frequently or hunter sense to see it around 10-15 meters away from the trail. IDK go for it if you wanna do this to yourself
Pros:
1. Character movement is much better and realistic than COTW
2. Hunting is more fun than COTW because animals are not absolute gods like that game. Like there, I have to go to worm mode before I get closer than 300 meter to them. Here, like I said I managed to run(sprint) up to 120 meters aways from deers.

4. Animals getting shot animation is better but still way worse than what we deserve with todays technology.

The tracking is more realistic in this one. Animals don't leave trails everywhere, just often generic paths between need zones. The blood trails smear leaves and branches, and look significantly better. The kill camera also shows organs and bones far more intricately. 

Weapons are realistic. Named in a realistic manner from real manufactures, and beautifully recreated and animated. Currently you can't change ammo type, but that is about to change according to the road map. 

Best part about the game are the devs. They're responsive on the discord, and constantly working on the game. Patches are steady and offer neat content roughly every other week.

I like the maps, the graphics, the story, and just about everything else.
But some things are missing though, that really should not be.

1 - Free look is missing, I think turning the entire player, instead of just his head is very 1990's and not cool !   
2 - Can't setup your own blinds, like tree stands and ground blinds or make a fire, and camp out before sleep.
3 - Recording the hunt, is sadly missing. 
4 - Some animals I associate with hunting, are missing, like The Blue Jays and Squirrels, sounding alarms.
5 - No proper seasons, most big game hunting is in late fall and winter, so most birds and insects are gone.      
     And we hope for early snow for tracking.

Don't get me wrong, as far as hunting games go it's fun, and better then most.  
I would really like to see more equipment, like stands, bows, blinds and tents.

Fun game, hope they keep adding to it. 
That's what I think so far.

immediate downsides are that it's pretty graphics intensive and feels sorta unoptimized, an occasional crash or two is expected. $40 is a little bit steep but not really by much. it could be worse. i'm buying it expecting more content soon.

it still floods you with an enormous amount of information when tracking or observing game, but without holding your hand too much. you won't get a glowing outline on animals, tracks are tougher to spot. reliance on audio and gradual perk upgrades feels like a natural and intuitive progression. you can still always turn off all the help and 'hunter vision' and play in ego mode if that's your style too.

this game cares way less about animal ""class"". most guns can do most things without hurting your score, however it also provides you with all the information you might need on ""why did i get such a low score?"" in case you decide to hit a bunny rabbit with .338 LM. you can play back the bullet impact and path through your animal in 3D, see the cavitation and energy dump, recommended energy and amount of meat% lost by shot. 

animal behavior in this game makes animal behavior in CoTW look like cabellas big game hunter for the gameboy color. guns and gear are licensed if you care about that. ballistics model is a lot nicer, shots feel punchier and more commanding than cotw. there's bullet drop, windage, the whole 9 yards. you can zero out to 1km. animals & bullet impacts render far out into that distance as well.

other downsides i can think of are only as a result of how new the game is - expecting to see a lot more guns, maps, gear, animals, etc in the coming year. hopefully tree stands, suppressors and night vision. maybe.

  The scenery in this game is wonderful . There are times when I would pause for a moment , and view my surroundings . it's like I'm really there . The hills of Transylvania is just as breath taking .

   The animals in the game really act realistic . The game developers really put an effort to making them look good .

   The sound in this game is nice . It's also soothing , especially when you hear the rushing of the river , the waterfalls , and the sounds of nature all around you .

    Now on to the downside of this game .

 It seems that you can only harvest one animal at a time , and that feels immersion breaking . For example , if you shoot one pig and bring it down , then you decide to shoot another pig dead . The first pig that you shot will just disappear before your eyes .

 The character you're going to be playing seems short . The shallow rivers seems like waist deep when you cross them . Some of the grasses seem tall in this game .

 The character you're playing sounds like a girl . Each time I jump over an obstacle , I seem to hear a woman's voice grunting .

Animals tend to disappear . I remember shooting a mule deer , and bringing it down . Then when I got to my kill , there is nothing to claim . Only a big puddle of blood to look at .

Another thing that breaks immersion , are the badgers and foxes in this game . It seems they can swim fast like fishes . Too bad that you can't , since your character can get stuck in knee deep water .

The character you play walks funny . This part is not game breaking for me , I just wanted to put it .

The story is terrible . On the plus side , you don't have to play through the story .



Other than what I said , I felt the game was great . It really makes for great entertainment . Therefore , I give this game a positive four out of five review .",1670726873,1670726873,True,1,1,0.521531105041503906,0,True,False,False

Pros: 

Firstly, the game has a lot more context and direction with the way the story is presented, making it feel less like a mindless killing sandbox. Secondly, the world actually feels alive and there are animals everywhere; they are skittish and you do need to be tactical, but overall it's easy to walk for 2 minutes and find something which is the opposite of my experience in other games. A big part of doing that is the UI and how information is presented; the map and encyclopedia make it very easy to figure out where you need to be at what time, but still forces you to explore to make full use of it which is brilliant design in my opinion. More importantly, the herd system is a huge deal breaker, and makes all the previous points I've mentioned feel that much more enjoyable. 

The rewards themselves like money and skills are also very well done, giving a consistent amount of progression without the need to grind to get a decent gun and perks. Again a lot of this is driven by exploration, and unlocking new hunting grounds along the way keeps the game flowing.

Cons:

The obvious elephant in the room for most people is tracking; it can be pretty rough. The issue isn't difficulty or bugs, it's more the lack of feedback when a shot wasn't fatal - blood trails simply stop if the animal survived, and it takes a while to notice the nuance of what blood amount & impurities actually mean. I think a voice line from River saying ""Ah, I don't think that was good enough"" or something similar would help clarify those situations before running to find the trail.

The car sounds like a hair dryer.

The weapon selection is pretty average, if not a little barren compared to COTW. There are very few semi-auto rifles, shotguns, and no pistols or bows. I understand licensing is often an issue here, and there has been an update with more Remington rifles, but I'd happily see some generic models & names just to have more variety.

Overall this game is more than worth the money, and pretty much all the criticism I've seen from launch has been tweaked or fixed which shows the devs are working hard to improve the game.",1670636198,1670636198,True,51,4,0.803648173809051514,0,True,False,False

1. When you make a good shot, you literally see the blood splatter through your scope, and when you get up there there's not a speck of blood to be found. After 45 mins of stalking, this is pretty disheartening.

2. You can only glass animals within a certain distance. 400 or 500 yds is probably the max distance that an animal will show up across the map. Or i'll see one animal from a distance, once I get closer.. other animals spawn with what was once one animal. Pretty Cheesy.

First, the movement is janky when crouched and especially when prone, I wont even look at the monitor when prone crawling.  The standing walk and crouch walk speed should be slower than it is IMO, so you cant really sneak up on animals even if you have cover.  They actually give you a final ""perk"", (seems more like a handicap to me) after crouch walking a certain distance which makes you crouch walk even faster and makes you 10 percent louder.  How is that a perk, to spook animals more easily when sneaking around? So if you're hoping for bows to show up in the game one day, I highly doubt it based on the context of the story and the way the character movement forces you to either spook animals or prone crawl, which is torture for your eyes.  A real sim should allow you to vary your walk speed to make less noise.  

Sadly the easiest way to hunt in this game is to just drive around and spot animals with the third person camera, they are far less spooked by the jeep than you walking around. I've drove up to bears at 100 yards and they didn't run when i got out of the Jeep, and this is without the perk you can get that makes your jeep 25 percent less likely to spook them.

Next, (and as of 2 days ago when writing this they supposedly added solo deer at least in the latest patch) the animals themselves were only in herds, never solo, which obviously is not realistic at all since anyone who sees deer on the reg knows they wander solo all the time.  But if they did indeed fix this, that is biggest issue I had, and that will make it a much better game now. 

Something else, until you've kinda learned the ropes so to speak, I wouldn't go straight for the 'Ranger' mode for the most realistic experience, for me that just made the experience frustrating.  I didn't expect deer to be such bullet sponges, not exactly realistic IMO.  I've shot my fair share of mature whitetail deer IRL with a rifle (30.06, 270 and 257) and I've never had one run more than 30 yards after being hit in the vitals. 

They use a 'bullet energy' gauge to determine how lethal of a shot it is and until you understand by seeing the graphs in the 'claim animal' screen, it can seem strange why a double lung shot deer runs for 1000 yards like nothing happened.  After playing for several hours now, it does make a kind of make sense and adds extra challenge so it's fine I guess.  Also, the bird hunting is pretty hollow without friends or a dog TBH, ducks especially are meh and could use some work.

Since those are my only real gripes, Its a pretty good game all things considered and has room to grow into something really special.  Definitely a must try for anyone who likes hunting games or big game hunting IRL.",1670453839,1670453839,True,2,1,0.5009041428565979,0,True,False,False

The graphics quality was stunning even before. And now it is so overwehlming that it almost hurts. The improvements I found when using max settings:

1. Far better render quality of mountains in the distance (this was the only really bad thing about graphics before). Now standing on top of a mountain looking over the scene really gives you the thrills.

2. Better vegetation render quality in the distance (there is always gras, it stops in very high distance, only).

3. Improved water appearance. Looks much more natural now.

4. Rock textures improved. In general stones look more natural now, I think.

5. Huge step forward in sound quality. That was one of the downsides of the game before, now it's good.

All of this comes to the cost of a significant drop in frame rates when maxing out the settings. I think it is at least 30%. But it is worth it.

Fun fact: The nearby grass needs almost half a minute to pop in after loading a location. But then it is always perfect.

So if you have a strong computer, you need to have this game. It ist the best show case of graphics state of the art you can get.

Only thing I really regret is that there are so few animals. I would like to have an easier time finding them. No problem about the hunting itself being difficult, but sometimes the world is too deserted for my taste.

As i'm from the UK who isn't a hunter and hasn't hunted. I have always be interested by hunting and watch meany shows about it. To hunt vicariously though this game and be encouraged to uphold ethical values I have, to hunt how I would hunt is awesome.

* Bow hunting
* Night-vision  Optics or Bino's

Graphically, its alright. Some games have better, some games don't. Depends on your taste....Sometimes I have texture drops and sometimes I don't. Or random blips in the camera. (All settings are set to max). 

Physically...this is where I start a little rant...1) WHY ARE THERE SO MANY EFFING TREES?!!?! 2) WHY DOES SNEAKING DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING?!?! You still just as well be jumping up and down and running through the tree groves! Christ. Its terrible. 3) WHY CAN WE ONLY GET 2 different binoculars?! Why can't we have a spotter scope or something as well...not like it'll do us any good because of all the effing trees, but...maybe?

There is so many trees that you can't see anything and hardly any of the animals are ever in a clearing (God forbid), and if you're trying to go through the trees to spot something...good luck. You just as well be playing music on your phone through a bluetooth speaker, as loud as it can get or bombing through the trees at mach jesus in a 95 chevy silverado with a 350 and 2.5 inch exhaust with no mufflers or cats. 

I like the diversity of animals, don't get me wrong. I like the diversity of weapons, don't get me wrong. Its got a good structure to it as a game, but take some of the trees out. The whole world isn't a damn forest. 

Other than that... Its fairly decent. Maybe some day we'll get things like Scent Blocker or something, some more binoculars, and get either our sensitivity to animal calls turned up, or their sensitivity to noise turned down. Cause those critters can hear a pin drop from 400 yards.

My 1st hunting game was Call of the Wild, which I picked up two months ago.  I have about 100 hours in it now, and though I have enjoyed it, the game has plenty of jank, and I could see there was plenty of room for improvement.  

Reading early reviews, there were two things that concerned me about WoTH.  One, was that many reviews said they had a very hard time finding animals, and that the animals spooked very easily, so they felt it was very unsatisfying to hunt them.  In my brief time playing so far, I didn‚Äôt find this to be the case.  I found animals, and was able to sneak up on them close enough to get a good shot.  Maybe the problems that people had earlier have been patched out of the game, or maybe they were just exaggerating the difficulty.

The second thing that had me worried was that many reviews said it was hard to track animals, and this I did find to be a real problem.  Of the 1st six deer I shot, I was only able to find blood to track on two of them.  Of those two, I found one because he did not go very far before dropping, and I lost the other one.  With four of the deer, I did not find any blood trail at all.

Then, recently, I shot a buck from on top of a hill, and I watched him run across a field and saw him drop dead.  I had put a marker down before I shot him, so instead of going straight to him, I went to where he was when shot, and looked for blood.  I looked all around, and found nothing.  I went to the fallen deer, and then looked back at my marker.  He had run about 70 or 80 meters in a straight line before falling.  I walked back from his body toward the original marker, and was only able to find a couple of small patches of blood near the body.

Now he had been shot thru the lungs, a kill shot that dropped him within a short distance, but left very little blood to track.  If I had not seen him fall in a open field, I probably would have lost him like so many other deer I had shot.

I hope they can improve the ability to track wounded animals.  It is no fun to spend a lot of time to line up a shot, and then have the quarry just vanish.

I know some players complain that COTW is too easy, and they want WoTH to remain hardcore. Well, that is what difficulty levels are for.  Hunting games are already a niche genre, and if this game only offers hardcore  levels, you are making the already small player base even smaller.

I will probably play this game for a couple of more sessions, but if it continues to have this much difficulty in tracking after about 10 hours of play time, I will probably set it aside and see if future updates change anything. Playing a game is supposed to be fun, and the more people that find it to be fun, the more copies you can sell.

I think the game has a great deal of potential, and I am hoping for the best.

I still wish their was bow hunting

----Game rating. 7/10----
 -.22 rifle sounds like a .50 cal. 
 -There is no bow hunting.. Even if there was, small or big game would be long gone before 
  you can even pull the bow string.. 
 -No snow
 -Shotgun no slug
 -feels impossible to sneak up on a bear. only way to get a shot is if u are 200 meters away 
  and you see it in an open field
 -only one main character. Once you start game. That is the only game mode you play.
 -can't change clothing or your face. everyone who buys game is same character
 -animals don't attack you
 -maybe total of 10 guns, 7 animal calls, 6 scopes, two binoculars
 -no ATV
 -I shot a badger like 7 times with .22 rifle. still took forever to fall down while I ran and 
  followed it waiting for it to die.. It only reads the first shot that hits the animal from what I saw.
 
--MULTIPLAYER--
I haven't tried it yet... All you have to do is look at the screenshots people took of the game and you will see all the bugs it has. I'm going to wait on this part of the game.

Other than all of this..PROBLEM WITH GAME THAT I HAVE IS A D3D FATAL ERROR. I have to restart PC every time it happens because it locks everything up and I can't ctrl, alt, del or even go to windows screen. Maybe it my PC specs. But it has been happening more often after some gameplay.

One can still have fun in photo mode (mostly playing around with the various bugs, such as bumping into a dead deer and it sending you flying into the sky).  But, since day one, this game encouraged herd management.  It makes since.  Kill the one star adults to weed out the bad genetics.  Well, after killing multiple five stars (none of which had genetics of more than 95%,  I've since killed two 1* adults that had 97.9 and 98.3% genetics.  That's simply BS.  A game can claim to simply be for entertainment and not speak of genetics, but if you stress genetics and herd management, yet you allow adult deer, that would be absolutely MASSIVE mature bucks, you CANNOT have them be only  1* at any stage of adulthood. It makes management 100% impossible.  Putting a $hit ton of hours into trying to properly play and manage deer, only to be kicked in the face upon harvesting them, is WRONG.  The game is also buggier now, than it was at release.  So, no matter how well they mean (and I wouldn't dare say they aren't trying) the fixes are NOT getting fixed.  The game doesn't reward players who do as they've said we should, and it's no fun.  Writing this, knowing that two people might read it, is enough to speak volumes at how upset I am with it.  Deerhunter 2004 was the last hunting game I enjoyed for a lengthy time, and I wish to god it would work on todays OS's.  Don't buy this one.


This game is for those who enjoy hunting, not shooting.  You'll get to shoot plenty, but compared to previous hunting games, it will be much, much less.  To get good animals in game, you start by weeding out the ones  with weaker genetics.  This means passing up plenty of shots at younger animals with good genetics.  They will mature and become magnificent, but that takes a little bit of time.  It's a bit buggy, but the developers are as in touch and as helpful as any i've come across.  They're extremely active and putting out fixes and improvements as quickly as they can.  Merely seeing the effort they go to is satisfying.  The maps are absolutely massive and contain an extremely large number of huntable species.  If you're able to be patient to get rewarded, this is the game.  If not, that's cool. Just stick with COTW.  I think everyone will enjoy both, but also prefer one over the other.  I enjoy the huge maps and being able to manage my animals, watch them grow, and finally display them in one of multiple awesome cabins after finally harvesting the big ones.",1663552591,1669347136,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Multiplayer was finally fixed around mix October to early November. Herds were fixed around mid September to early October, new guns were released among all the bugs. Still no bows. The game has only improved and I cant wait for the hunting bug to hit me again.

here COTW has always felt like an arcade hunting game, WOTH feels like a proper hunt and with its varying degrees of difficulty it has something for everyone as if the hunts to hard just go to an easier difficulty or if your like me and the hunt feels to easy to go a harder difficulty. I personally have played some adventure difficulty but mainly hunter difficulty.

Pros
First and foremost amazing story that I actually feel attached to unlike COTW's story mode.

Shooting a rifle feels amazing, everything from taking the shot to seeing it lands is addicting!

Adventure difficulty feels slightly harder than COTW but with an easier mode bellow it the game can be played at least slightly arcade like.

Above adventure mode are Hunter and Ranger modes which are what I was looking for in a hunting game, these modes are harder than COTW and you have to take into account every thing from wind direction, wind speed, distance to animal, ect everything while hunting.

Each difficulty provides better payouts for your kills. In adventure mode a young one star male moose goes for roughly 400$ in Hunter roughly 600 but in Ranger 900, the game really rewards you for harder hunts and it feels amazing!

While there are fast travel points scattered through out the map they feel like they are far enough apart so the map doesn't feel small and only provide a place to sleep without the ability to spawn a vehicle so if you want to restock or rearm you still need to bring a vehicle out to them.

Cons
No tier 4 game so no excuse to bring out Grandpa's favorite hunting rifle! Me and my friends have been looking everywhere for some excuse to take it out!

Currently people joining multiplayer desynch and can animals do not detect them but multiplayer is fifth on the urgent fix list.

Things that WOTH sets out to do and does better than COTW :
- Better physics of the world. The trees, the foliage, the wind and the weather flows and changes much organically.
- Better Animal behavior, physics and animations. As a Hunting game, they nailed this part down to a tee. Animals react better and move more convincingly. Trophy system and Herd management system is very welcoming.
- Nicely package game with 2 maps and all amenities without a need of paywall.
- Gun physics are better implemented, researched and have more depth than COTW. bulletdrop, hit energies and zeroing and such.
- Landscape is better designed and organically flows well from one place to another. Felt lived in.
- Much needed long distance draw distance and can spot animals up to 800ms, something a hunting game should be doing.

Overall, the main plus point of this game is how organic it feels to be hunting in the world. Tracking systems, the way to spot animals are much much more organic. In COTW, there was too much reliance on hunter mate but here you have look and mark your own way around so that you don't get lost. You have to use more of your brain organically to consider the terrain before you shoot or approach the game. There is a lot more strategy involved in hunting here than COTW which is more arcadey and straigh-foward than here.

There are minus points about this game - Those are follows.
Sound- Not as well design as COTW. The latter has one of the best sounds in any game. Gunsounds aren't as meaty and sound mixing is all over the place. Certain sounds can get very loud and some barely can hear.

Graphics - maybe it's because it's an unreal engine 4. The COTW engines looks better and runs better, partly due to the environment mechanic in COTW is quite static so they can look better as a trade-off. Framerate is an issue of contention even after the patch and it can get very wishy washy in WOTH. Sometimes it runs well. Sometimes it runs like ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. Anti-aliasing tech is quite bad too. Even at Temporal (its highest quality setting available), everything looks fuzzy as hell. The graphics just look more messy and underdeveloped. Switching this to unreal 5 might be better? I don't know I'm not in game developing to tell. It has some questionable low asset models at distance that looked like Phantom animals and seeing animals with naked eyes over at distance is very bad. Coupled that with how fuzzy the whole bloody thing looks and i couldn't help but miss COTW rather static but sharp looking world. This is major issue for me, for Graphics and I feel they need to relook at their engine or implement new change while maintaining their optimization. Oh yes, the game is poorly optimized.

Movement Mechanics : COTW hands down have better movement design implemented. Here, not able to tell how much noise I'm making going through bushes because simply there is no sound effect or meter to back it up. There is no indication of how visible are you or camouflaging mechanic implemented like how legacy titles like Cabela Big game hunter games used to do, so it's a bit of a shame. so without indication in terms of sound effect or meter, you kinda go into bushes praying you're not compromised.

Bugs and lack of quality of life choices at launch - For a game at full price at launch, there are some game breaking bugs (which are being worked on btw) are no excuse and shows Nordic's experience in handling a game is quite immature. You will get frustrated with the kind of bugs you see in the game time to time.

Overall, still the good things outweigh the bad. It is unique in its own right that it doesn't rip off COTW or Make COTW irrelevant. I'm glad i have two hunting games to rotate between now. More arcadey COTW and more semi-realistic and chill WOTH.",1669232336,1669232336,True,56,1,0.847339868545532227,8,True,False,False

I've no recent relationship to other hunting sims, but this world is so immersive I'm in constant awe. 

I grew up in the country-side (until age 7) with wilderness around and deer eating my mother's vegetable garden (fond memories of her with the broom chasing them), and as a Norwegian you have to like the outdoors whether you want to or not, so there was a lot of hiking school trips and cross-country skiing and boy-scouts and all that, up to the point I started hating it and found my calling as a couch potato.

Now to be that couch potato and experience this world, which looks very realistic in my eyes, I've gotten a newfound love for nature without having constant wet clothes and toilet paper.

I love how this game plays, the freedom. There is no pressure and you can do what you want. And the interaction between the animals is so amazing to just sit and observe. The accurate sounds from the animals and the eerie atmosphere in forests and such.

Very pleasantly surprised!

I have hunted all my life and am a firearm enthusiast so I yearn for a hunting game full of realism which I have found in bits of several game but never the whole package.   First all the game on max settings is absolutely gorgeous, I was in awe. Unfortunately it runs at 15 fps which forces me to lower the settings but I still looks good despite looking a little grainy. Secondly the ballistics/trauma is very spot on, from the organ placement to the arterial wound opportunity is very realistic. The Call of the Wild fell short in regards to the shot trauma in my opinion, dropping the realism for me sadly. What I have the most issue with is the firearm rating system. The first mission is to harvest a badger with a 30-30 rifle which is absolutely ridiculous because of the fact that that is probably the most famous/used deer cartridge known to man besides the 30-06. Also the fact that the .243 win is a class above the 30-30 is just ridiculous given the fact that a 30-30 is appropriate for game up to American black bear which the .243 is not. The .243 is appropriate for small game like woodchucks, badgers, and coyotes to medium game like deer and pronghorn but I would not go any heavier than that. I know the game was only recently released and has room for patches and improvements which I eagerly await. I haven‚Äôt been able to look through the remainder of the game for anything else I have found distasteful due to being busy with work. I don‚Äôt usually message developers with issues that I find with their games because I don‚Äôt find it in good taste or I believe that others have already brought it to their attention but this has bothered me to no end.

If you¬¥ve played other hunting games you should give it a try since it¬¥s the most realistic hunting sim atm. As a newcomer I¬¥d start with ""Way of the hunter"" before trying other games since the adjustable difficulty is really helpful to learn the game mechanics while having fun.

Seems like ""Way of the Hunter"" was made for console and ported to the PC with the QA testing slacking from the initial first impression.

But if you give it a fair chance and stick with it, there does seem to be a good game here with a solid base and good core mechanics to build on, I hope the developer's working on WotH do right by the game and make it the best hunting game out... *cause everyone knows at this point: almost anything would be better than what the EW devs have been shoveling for the past 5yrs with CotW*

With the mod community support, they can make some good mods/skins for the game and the dev's just need to polish the game up and release some good DLC and I think everyone will be happy hunters.

First off, the game could definitely use more updates in performance, and have a better breakdown of DLSS settings (i.e. Performance, Balanced and Quality mode settings for said feature). Furthermore, micro-stuttering is a constant, especially when driving, and plenty of FPS drops in certain areas should all be addressed since both maps are plagued with these issues. Second, a bit more clarity for some of the hunting sense tips in the form of being more identifiable and easier to track / follow would also be very helpful. Finally, the driving needs to be a bit better and more fleshed out; it feels floaty and odd to control, but not really a major downside as it is mostly a means to an end. Overall, when the game runs smoothly, WotH is gorgeous to look at and offers a massive map / animal variety to hunt  / hunt around in for both Nez Perez and the second map. Both feature different types of game to hunt and scenery to enjoy. Hopefully Way of the Hunter gets the continued love and attention it deserves because it has a great foundation to continue to build upon and is already extremely fun to play, Thus, for now, Way of the Hunter gets a 7/10, and is one I highly recommend to pick up on sale and play if one can look past some of its glaring performance issues and minor bugs / glitches.

Its harder than I expected, which is why I initially hated it.  I also seriously thought that this was made by the same devs as Call of the Wild because it is so similar.  The gameplay mechanics are almost identical to COTW an so are the visuals.  The tracking in this game is way harder than COTW because the ""hunter vision"" doesn't stick out as much.  In my opinion this game is a little harder than I wanted it to be.  You actually have to sit and wait for the animals to show up for some pretty unreasonable times.  There should really be some way to skip a certain amount of time without having to travel to a lodge just to sleep for a few hours and then physically travel all the way back to where the animals were at.  The scale also seems a bit off because it is really hard to get to the recommended 100 meters from a deer before you take the shot.  The animals just seem a little too keenly aware of you no matter how quiet you are.  Also, there is no way to know how much noise you are making.  
All in all though, its not terrible.  Once you get the hang of it, it is a fun hunting game, but it takes a long time for a new player to settle in to things and the game does need some work as far as making it more fun.",1668173671,1668372741,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The weapons and ammo are not properly explained for the novice hunters.

I am a Tarkov (Escape from Tarkov) player, and this hunting game made me realize why sometimes it takes so many shots 4+ to down a target. It also taught me that you really have to understand anatomy and aim properly (to hit vitals) if you want to take targets down with just 1 shot.

While the main idea of the game is good and in some ways better than other hunting games, its execution is lacking.
There is so many bugs and things that need to be fixed but the developers choose to fluff the game to get sales instead and when they do get acknowledged and finally gets fixes, it seems to create other issues.

Here is a list of some of the problems:
- fatal errors/ crashes / freezes
- animals not making sounds
- guns not making sounds
- constant red eye flickering when very far from an animal (with the Halloween update)
- audio crackling 
- sounds too loud in comparison to others
- cant claim animals in multiplayer
- falling under the map 
- sensitive spook mechanics 
- walk right up to animals without them spooking
And many many more.

If you have a SteamDeck  AVOID  this game. The developers dont care to support this or even acknowledge it after they broke the latest update forcing this device from over 30 FPS to just 15 FPS  making it virtually unplayable.
The are afriad to support Linux naively and are not interested in testing proton.

They arent even interesting in testing their game before making updates. They will push patches directly to the stable branch without caring.  This has caused some of us, me included, to completely loose our saves with no way to recover.  100+ hours down the drain because they cant structure their code properly

Firstly, let's get this out of the way: yes, I recommend this game; however, I want to add that I really hope the devs aren't done [b]expanding the base game.[/b] At the moment, it works as a whole game, but for the price I feel that it is somewhat lacking in features, which gives it a late early access sort of feeling.

I'd also like to address the big complaint I'm seeing in the reviews: how the game runs. I have been seeing a lot of people complaining about optimization, and to be straight forward I have no idea what they're on about. I can run every setting maxed with no issue or impact to take note of.

[u]Now, to the actual content present:[/u]
The Good. The strong points with this game have been the AI, the maps, and the firearm ballistics. 

Animals have some of the best behaviors I've seen in these styles of games: they spook properly, remember player actions, and have lasting reactions to how you play. The only thing I could say I want is interaction between animals of differing types.

The maps are beautiful and well thought out. They have plenty of size, lots of things to explore, and a realistic sort of simulated environment. The reserves are properly huge, and the vehicle works surprisingly well with how it's built. You'll find yourself pulling over and hiking into your area, as well as hiking back to the car to pack out as you actually would, which is a nice thing to see and realize is effective. 

The firearm ballistics are honestly some of the best out there for a hunting game. Range and wind/weather affect shot placement, and projectile energy and wound channels matter. Using the proper caliber outside of its effective range will actually affect the success of your shots.

The Bad. The game displays great depth down a very, very narrow stream, with some of the gamifications being questionable.

The amazing firearm ballistics are let down by the lack of actual firearm selection. On offer are bolt actions, lever actions, and shotguns. That's it. Many calibers present in the game only have a single rifle that uses it, and many of these seem to be intentionally limited in capabilities. For example, there are two semiautomatic shotguns present, with the maximum capacity being three shells. The .223 is only used in a single bolt action rifle, despite being one of the most popular and successful calibers out there. Optics are limited two two red dots and four actual scopes. 

On a similar note, multitudes of things you'd expect in a hunting game are not present. There are no bows, no scent remover, no portable stands or blinds, and no ammunition selection. That last one really baffles me, as it is an easy way to multiply the content already present with minimal effort. Shotguns are limited to only birdshot, despite literally having a cartridge called [i]buck[/i]shot.

There is effectively only one car with multiple skins. I don't know why we have the option to select vehicles when that's the case. 

I also question some of the decisions regarding perks, as being unable to turn them on and off paired with some perks that give both a negative/positive seems off. I'm actually having to actively avoid some achievements so that I don't have to have those downsides.

As a final comment, I just want to summarize a bit. What's there is damned good, and there's serious potential for this game to be one of the best in the genre. It's really just a case of deep as a canyon, narrower than your street. As such, the price is pretty high for what's currently here. Wait for a sale, but it is worth getting. Hopefully the devs work on expanding the base game's offering so I can change that caveat. To the devs, we've got an absolute ton of space with all the maps here. A ridiculous amount.

Game is overall lacking weapon choices (no bow or hand guns), only 2 binoculars and most scopes have better view/range, calls/lures variety is lacking and to compound that you have to ""level up"" your usage, scent masking is non existent , tree stands - nope, hunting blinds - nope, etc. There are stationary hunting stands that appear to be randomly placed in the world without any consideration to the surrounding area. 

Can only speed up time by going BACK to your camp or cabin and then resting...meaning you have to hike all the way back to where you were. Should be able to pass time in the field; nothing like waiting an hour in real time for nothing to happen while waiting in a stand. 

Can't fast travel to anywhere except camp sites and cabins (if you've already visited once); should be able to fast travel to the hunting stands as well. Could easily have a time mechanic that fast forwards time based on distance fast traveling so you dont have players jumping across the map in 2 seconds.

Bigger rocks and fallen trees are not passable at all, you have to walk around them...if only we could walk over them like the bipedal alpha predator we are.

The game, like all games, has a few bugs, but they are not nearly as common as some reviewers would have you believe.

Herd management is really fun and adds a big strategic component to your hunting. The maps are really nice with plenty of open space along with forests, hills, and marshes. While you can't just pop a tent and tripod down anywhere, walking pace is comfortable and not too slow; you can change speeds when upright and crouched. There's also a very nice difficulty setting with four levels for a broad spectrum of players. There are presently two maps and a vehicle to get around.

Update 11/7/2022: So far the devs have been responsive, issuing measured but not rushed patches that consistently solve issues without creating others, as well as releasing a free weapons DLC that adds some nice variety and is practically different than existing weapons, rather than just visually/audibly different.

Not just how the animals react, lack of calls and body behavior, but the distance at which they spook and how easily they do.  In real life, you couldn't get the reaction this game has at 100 yards.  Heck I remember as a young man, getting to my hunting area late, on more than one occasion, so I ran there.  Only to drop my head, cause without realizing it, I ran right into the middle of the group.  All the deer looking at me like, who crashed the party.  Even then, if I remained still they did nothing.  Yet while prone, in the brush, down wind animals will spook at over 200 yards.  That is not even close to realistic, or even super realistic as some would have you believe.  This is an animal preserve, so they don't even know how to react to a hunter.  It's just so laughable. How would our ancestor ever eaten anything?  Wife, need more arrows/stones, darn animals have super power, sight, smell and hearing.  We may need a new tribe, we can call it Vegan.  Lets hope Devs, no touch berries, fruits and vegetables or we starve.

Update 10/5/22  Only two updates even with all the players who've paid to beta test this game.  Now a Bear release, wait for it, with a tag of dev. version.  Look I'm not trying to save people who already paid for this game money.  I'm just telling the truth of the game as it is.  If you know nothing of hunting and your expectations of a simulation game isn't high, buy this game.  I seriously doubt you will be disappointed, well unless you want to do multi-player.  Be somewhat warned though, if you watch the latest, dev. #7 game review, pay attention they state they have an intended play style approach for players.  So you will feel a sense of not fully in control when playing.  Possibly the reason why so many players have a problem with the game, classified as a simulation.

Update 09/18/22 Well it seems, so far, blood trails are working as they should.  Wind and sound noise has also been adjusted to prevent the feeling you are, in Hurricane Jane or Big Foot walking around.  I still have hope that support for this game will continue.  I'll wait to see what is fixed next before changing to a thumbs up.  Patches should be popping fairly quick with all the people they now have, actually beta testing.  

WoW!!!  There are some really crazy people.  Buy, Buy Buy it's awesome.  ROFL  My original review still stands.  But I'm updating it with this.  08/23/2022

People are comparing this game to Call of the Wild, hunting game.  A game that is 5 years old.  Which I also own.  They are saying CotW is arcade style and WotH is a real life hunting simulation.  Really?!!!!  Since when do hunters use Red Bull bullets?  You remember the Red Bull commercials.  It gives you wings.  Cause when you shoot a large animal, you give them wings.  They bleed, but no longer leave tracks.  

One week since release.  No Dev. message admitting their mess nor their plan to fix it.  Stay Away until you know for sure the up coming state of the game.  It's your money and you deserve it.  

Below is my original review...........

Boy I really want to give this game a thumbs up.  But currently I cannot.  While you have those that want to bash others for a negative review, they sadly aren't interested in an opinion of a different gamer.  

Why do I give this a negative review, this game is not ready for release.  At best this is a beta release and players are paying to beta test it.  It's very clear this was not done prior to release.  You can tell by how many objects are elevated off the ground.  Walking a trail and there is more poo piles, that are fresh btw, than all the animals in a normal zoo.  But when you track down that beast of a herd, there are only six animals.  Scripted events occur as you draw near and not by line of sight.  So you character may comment about an animal, without having seen it, cause it's on the other side of a hill.  Raise your rifle and zoom in with your scope, what happens.  The scope doesn't zoom in, your entire FOV zooms in.  Just to name a few things.  There are more......

So when you read the review of a thumbs up bashing a negative review, realize they paid for this game already.  Just like I have and have played it well past the refund option.  So they want other people to buy this game.  Cause if other people don't put money into, the less likely the producers and devs will.  I've read many of the negative reviews and I have yet seen one of them say anything about the game that is not true.

Don't listen to the lemon sellers.  You know those reviews that say it's OK to buy a game that's not ready, it's normal so we should accept it.  Those individuals have no concept of what normal is.  Normal is, getting what you paid for and not a reflection of what you were buying.  

With that being said, I hope the game does get the patches it needs.  It is a beautiful game and some clever thought went into it.  THQ has normally been a gaming company with a good reputation.  I've got future release games of theirs on my wishlist.  I hope I don't have to remove them.

Wait to see if the developers are committed to game via patches.  If they are and you like hunting games, buy it.  If not walk away and don't worry about the tears falling from the thumbs uppers.  Cause this is normal..  and they'll accept it as such.  LOL",1660887758,1667423664,False,243,18,0.773447871208190918,0,True,False,False

It is to COTW as a grape is a watermelon, COTW being a bad grape. I like the landscapes, terrrain and continuation of play each time you open the game. I'm just now getting to a little herd management which has resulted in 3 recent 5 Star trophies, and many 4 Stars growin in to their turn. I played theHunter Classic from the beginning in 2009, so there is that standard to compare with. Two different games. I like that its not call animals in and shoot. You have to work at it, and that makes if so much more fun. There are some things I don't like..not being able to traverse the landscape easily (too much slipping and sliding on slopes and hills) is one of the big ones for me. Also, almost all species have the same life cycle, so you are stuck on a loop from 9am to 10 pm for drinking zones, 5 am to 5 pm for eating zones, etc. It means to maximuze effort you are hunting half the time in the dark. Another drawback for me is the looooong walks to need zones from the closet fast travel spot. There are a few here and there that are close by, but mostly you're looking at 2-3hour in game walk to where you want to be, every time, and all the time trying to keep from spooking the verrry verrrry sensitive animals. Frustrating in the dark. As time goes on I hope to develop stratagies to overcome some of those issues. So far I've only hunted at Nez Perce, and have only harvested around 145 animals. That's my selective nature, not going to just go shoot stuff. Its a long term game, not a instant gratification, so it may not be your cup of tea.

Most are going to compare it to Call of the wild, which has 5+ years of content. I may edit this review depending on the direction devs take the game in the next 6 months.

The Story is cringey to say the least, has some underlying virtue signaling. The ""side jobs"" are a solid element to the game that i really hope they expand upon with future updates. They're also a great way to make extra cash.

As far as the map design, it blows COTW out of the water. I haven't played on the 2nd map yet so i may edit after ive played it. The way the map changes in different zones is A tier imo. The verticality spread throughout the map makes for many ways to approach your prey and take your shot. Theres something amazing about scaling the steep mountain sides monitoring the valley below with binos and seeing a heard of animals and taking your shot from so high up. As for graphics and rendering foliage at distance i cant tell the true capabilities of the game, i run on medium to high settings due to my PC's specs.

The game may be light on how many animals but the way they've designed them is fantastic imo. The way animals have a life cycle and you will see a young white tail buck in a heard grow into a mature one with new sets of antlers is awesome. As for spotting animals, I find it to be so much better than COTW. It doesnt put some cheesy outline around the animal like COTW, and when you're tracking it doesnt point you in the direction when you analyze the blood.

Their idea of genetics is interesting as well. Take out the Mature deer with small racks and the new respawns might yield higher genetic bucks, resulting in higher scoring bucks. I hope they make tweaks to the spook radius of animals, at times it can be annoying when you spook animals on the complete other sides of mountains of you, but if you follow the sound ques to the direction they spooked its pretty easy to re-track them.

Only complaint at the moment is that the bleed trail is screwy and I loose a lot of kills.

With over a 1K+ hours and hundreds of dollars in The Hunter before it moved to steam, where that was a pay to play business model that I abhor and won't ever go back to. COTW improved both graphics and game play offering grind instead of pay to play it quickly devolved into copy pasta DLC which is just as bad, as the bugs weren't being sorted out in favour of DLC cash grab which I also loathe. Way of the hunter feels more polished than COTW yet with less content and places more emphasis on hunting rather than buying the latest rifle which is a refreshing change. It has great potential to become the best of the stack of hunting games.

Bugs there are a few, most annoying so far have been getting stuck in trees but I have adapted and walk around them now. Animals are a bit to sketchy and spook too easily (even in a thunderstorm and upwind) however this helps to negate the run and gun of the previous mentioned games. Bird sounds get obnoxious and have the same damn sound regardless of where you are on the map, like the damn hooty owl in the middle of the day! 

Herd management is an interesting addition which goes well with the pro hunting message carried throughout the missions  which is something I wholeheartedly agree with. A lot of bad the press and lies put out from anti hunting/shooting groups in my country who only seek to infringe my favourite pastime with their lack of knowledge and bigotry pushing our government to make restrictions needlessly. Hopefully if more people come to see hunting as a positive thing this could change.

There are elements to this game comparing to the hunter call of the wild that are actually better, and some that makes me want to change to that game.

How its better than the hunter cotw:
- The sound of branches snapping as the deer run away is super realistic, it almost feels like your in the game. The game is harder than the hunter cotw. In cotw, you can shoot like 10 animals in just 5 minutes, while in way of the hunter, it may take you an hour or more just to hit one. I like this sort of challenge because as a real hunter, you are not like Rambo killing every animal you see! Tracking is more realistic than cotw. When you hit a deer, you will find blood on branches, logs, etc. It is also more challenging to track. I think the animal movements in general are more realistic than in cotw, however I have heard some argue otherwise. I also love the antler variations in the game, which I think cotw's antler variation is good as well. The rifles also have licensed brands, such as Remington, Steyr, and more!

What makes you want to go back to cotw:
- Lets start off by saying that the animal designs are sub par compared to cotw. I mean, they are not the worst animal designs I have seen compared to other hunting games, but it could be tweaked. Duck hunting is broken, just like the hunter cotw (however, the hunter cotw's duck hunting is greatly improved compared to when it was at launch). There are a lack of hunting options compared to cotw. For example, in cotw you can hunt with bows, pistols, muzzleloaders, and rifles, but in way of the hunter, you can only hunt with rifles. The multiplayer is buggy on way of the hunter, and I did not find the multiplayer as fun to play as cotw.

Overall, the game holds up as being a great hunting game, but there are things about this game that could be improved.

Good - Very detailed, high rendering distance, anatomically correct animals. 

Bad - Texture popping.

Sound:

Good - Well rounded, or fairly diverse, ambient sounds. Animal calls realistic.

Bad - Mixing needs work. Many ambient bird and water rushing are too loud, footsteps too quiet, guns too quiet. Guns spook animals far away, if 'm firing it, I should hear it too.

Gameplay:

Good - The game uses herd management and killing off weak males to get better males, which I think works really well - except the devs don't explain this in-game - which they should - since River would have been undoubtably told how to by his grandpa. Awesome post hunt review. Correcting shots for the next hunt made easier. I enjoy the hunter sense as well. I don't know why others think animals spook easy... I can routinely creep up on deer to within 50m. However, it's not easy, and it takes moving between concealment... and when they're not staring directly at you. I lke the emphasis on employing the right caliber, although, the higher the caliber, the less suffering, therefore, more ""ethical"". The needs system works really well and gives the player an incentive to learn about each animals behavior and predictable pathing. 

Bad - Tracks are terrible. Needs a complete revamp. COTW did it way better. There's no indication how old or fresh the tracks are - and in most cases, they lead no where... I wonder if they're only supposed to be a clue as to the pathing of animals between needs areas. Planning, scouting, and executing a hunt are only part of the hunting experience. This game puts an emphasis on realism but forgets about what happens after you shoot the animal. Yes, if it runs, you gotta use the blood trail... and then you find it... now what? You click on it, it disappears, and you get money? Ha... make use of that jeep, or rather, turn it into a vehicle used for getting game up off the ground... with a winch, cause that lispy soy latte River ain't picking up no elk. Players should learn to field dress, or quarter an animal to pack it back to their vehicle... strapping 120lbs of meat and bone in your pack and walking 2 miles in the woods will make you think twice about shooting an animal. River should be able to keep certain cuts of meat, or sell them for different prices... the bullet caliber and shot placement should determine which cuts he can save (no more shoulder shots). Talk to a hunter, half the convo will be about tenderloin and backstrap. And, devs, FYI, if you're going to hunt elk or moose, or even deer in the sticks... where's the horse? And yeah, you shoot horseback, and no, horses don't spook deer.

Story: 

There's no good or bad, it's just a story written by someone who doesn't like hunting, trying to justify hunting. There's no such thing as ""ethical hunting"" beyond what they teach you as a kid in hunter safety... there's only legal and illegal hunting. I've been hunting most of my life and never heard any man call himself an ""ethical hunter"". I get it, if you're like our character, who comes from money, and laughably sells meat to be eaten by rich people, yes, I suppose ""ethical hunting"" is a luxury you can afford, whereas you place strict, ""sporting man"" rules upon yourself to alleviate the guilt you feel when you violently blow the lungs out of a living creature. But broke-ass, starving hill folk don't give a damn about killing an animal that can't run. And all that stuff about trapping being evil - try hunting semi-aquatic or burrowing strickly-nocturnal animals. All that said, most of the characters are fairly memorable and I didn't hate the story.

Bottom line:

This game is more difficult than its chief competitor, Hunter: COTW, but unlike that game, Way of the Hunter has soul, and leans toward the spirit of hunting, it's just still growing, and a little limp wristed.

I would love if you added more dangerous behaviour for the animals. Being hunted by a bear or a lion, or charged by bucks and wildboars, would add more thrills to the hunts in my opinion. I wish the animals could hurt you and attack you.",1666452964,1666628972,True,1,0,0.483533710241317749,0,True,False,False

Spook system is utterly broken, crawling 300m out from any thing, spooks everything around you, even if there is a mountain between you and the animal's line of sight.

had at least 6 hard fatal crashes.(with nothing but ""fatal crash"") 

had multiple blood trails and game disappear, making it frustrating to progress.

shot animals in the head and they got up and run away and disappear... did this with a black bear and 5 white tail deer. 

feels like using a 30-30 or the 223 at anything further than 50-100m the bullets just bounce of the animals.
as some one who owns a 30-30 this is utterly unrealistic.

Blood trails can be way to hard to try and spot let alone try to follow.


Pros.
Game looks great.

IF they fix the spook system. i could recommend this game, but as this stage would be a hard pass.

GOOD :

The graphics, sound, animal models, rifle selection, and shooting mechanics are all spot on and done very well. ( Latest weapons patch does have issues though )
The Story is NOT award winning but interesting enough to be fun.
The Mission system is well thought out, not super easy, and yet not overly difficult.
Each map has a Lodge for mounting trophies, not one Lodge for everything.
Real World Hunting Experience can and will serve you well in game to reduce the learning curve.
Trophies are NOT spawned and thrown at you...they are grown and You MUST EARN THEM.
Hunting Pressure acts and reacts VERY Realistically.
Maps are huge and well thought out with plenty of room to add more species.
You can tell the Devs really put their best foot forward in the planning and implementation stages to create a REAL WORLD Hunting Sim. Their efforts have produced a game with GOBS OF POTENTIAL.

BAD :
  
Since day ONE : there is ONE BIRD FILE that was recorded at 100% volume and does not react well to the ambient noise volume slider. If at ANY time you remain still for any length of time this bird slowly gets louder, and Louder, AND LOUDER until you will lose your hearing using a headset. The ONLY way to silence him is to move, and then the volume creep begins all over again, until you move again.

SPOOKING : Is super realistic and done very well BUT...BIG BUT HERE...the sensitivity is UNGODLY HIGH. I have and continue to spook animals at over 400 yards away WITH SLOW TO NO MOVEMENT AND THE WIND BLOWING AT ME. Very seldom do animals give an ALERT call to hint to me I need to stop or slow down. They go from CALM to WARP SPEED with no alerts at all. I have also spooked animals at long range THROUGH HILLS where there is ZERO sight distance and no wind effects at all WHILE SLOW CREEPING.

Animal Movement : Major issue here is the fact that almost everyone has experienced animals WALKING ACROSS THE BOTTOM OF A LAKE / POND. Also shooting an animal and it runs to the center of a pond and dies where you can't harvest it. WALL OFF THE WATER...Let the animals wade knee deep sure BUT WALL OFF THE WATER.

Character Movement : He can safely stroll THROUGH DOWNED TREES but THE SMALLEST PEBBLE GRABS HIS FOOT AND STOPS HIM COLD?? There are also places in the map with a grade he can climb without issue, yet other lesser grades he just slides down repeatedly??

From Day ONE : Optimization has been spotty at best especially for AMD GPU users. The game has run well but with issues. FPS drops and sound stutters being the main 2 culprits. The Devs HAVE stated it is better suited for NVidia users and they would try and remedy the issue. I have seen modest improvements but it is NO WHERE NEAR where the optimization should be for an AMD GPU. ( 6700XT & R9-3900X )

Something I have seen with my own eyes but thankfully not in my game YET : Random herd resets on platforms...PC, PS5, and XBox. Groom a herd to produce wonderful trophies...they drop a patch...now that herd has disappeared and all your work is for nothing. This happens with no mention of it in the Patch Notes.

SOMETHING I HAVE SEEN IN MY GAME : You spend days culling and grooming a herd...NEVER shooting more than One and at times not shooting at all...you watch as the males grow to enormous trophy size and are almost ready to produce....AND THE GAME RANDOMLY SWAPS THAT HERD TO ANOTHER AREA ON THE MAP. Now all of your work is for naught because you have to hunt EVERY area that animal is known to be to find THAT HERD. In this process you waste so much time those trophies die and it is pointless. Animals are creatures of habit. Where there is food, water, and bedding WITHOUT ANY ENCROACHMENT they will STAY. Human contact, scent, and shooting will push them out...or for some the Rut will make them move slightly....BUT as long as they are unmolested and comfortable they will STAY THERE. I have proven this IN GAME with careful culling and A LOT OF time spent just OBSERVING. For the game to just decide to move my herds on a whim after all the work I put in is a SLAP IN THE FACE to say the LEAST. I realize Pressure can make animals change zones BUT when you DELIBERATELY MINIMIZE PRESSURE as much as possible and the herd still disappears?

Hunter Sense : Works well but it has issues..the Main issue being THE HIGHLIGHT COLOR...it is the same color as the highlight for need zones. A bleeding animal can run through a need zone and it takes DAYS to find the blood trail because your blood highlight is the same color as the zone!!! Either make highlight colors different OR give US AN OPTION to set the colors how we want them PLEASE!!

Spotting : Very Realistic but Very Cumbersome for a Game...if the ONLY way to spot is with Binocs then fine I can accept that BUT ANIMALS MOVE. The animation time between Binocs and Rifle up at the ready KILLS THE SPOT because animals are always moving. At least allow us SOME KIND OF MARKER through the binocs in order to maintain track on the animal we want. This way there are a lot less wrong animals shot.

MULTIPLAYER : Was at first unplayable...and is now PLAYABLE but still a total steaming pile. WORK IN PROGRESS and nowhere near release ready.

 for any Devs :

First off : This game is astounding and everyone should be praised for their efforts. This game truly has an insurmountable amount of Potential to be Famous and Top of The Heap. Having said that it is time for blunt honesty.

Firstly : This game was RELEASE WORTHY NOT RELEASE READY. Whoever had the total Brain Fart to release a REALISTIC HUNTING SIM without BOWS, PORTABLE STANDS, AND COVER SCENT needs a serious reprimand and some lessons on Hunting in general. I don't care what their position is they need a serious talking to even if it is the CEO. I am NOT a Bow Hunter. I have over 40 years Hunting with rifles of various types and Hunting various game. TOO MANY PEOPLE BOW HUNT TO ALIENATE HALF YOUR PLAYER BASE ON RELEASE!!!!! These things SHOULD have been IN GAME DAY ONE and were not.

SECOND : There are a lot of issues present from Day One...and after numerous patches THEY ARE STILL THERE. For Gods Sake people!!! STOP trying to make good on promises and create more content!! We appreciate your efforts we really do!! Fix the CORE GAME FIRST and make it what it truly CAN BE!! THEN worry about new guns, maps, and animals. If the core code is bugged it does no good to throw patch over patch on top of it. FIND the issues and FIX them THEN WORRY ABOUT CONTENT AND PATCHES.

FINALLY : This is in reference to point two above. IF you want to BETA test your game there are better ways to do it than SELL IT TO US and wait for us to complain. If I am going to BETA test for you AFTER spending my money on the game YOU WILL SEND ME A CHECK EVERY WEEK AS AN EMPLOYEE. This practice by game developers is reprehensible to say the least. There are 2 ways to remedy this reputation which game developers have brought upon themselves :

ONE :
Make the game a BETA and hold a contest...choose a certain number of winners to play the game for FREE and send in feedback. NO ONE spends anything and you get the information you need to make the game RELEASE READY.

TWO :
GO BACK TO THE BEST WAY TO TEST : Hire your own BETA testing team and set them up in HOUSE. Test your game 14 ways from Sunday BEFORE you even consider releasing it. ONLY THEN do you release the free BETA contest and let others test it as well. FINALLY you have all the information needed for a TRUE STABLE RELEASE.
PLEASE for Gods Sake STOP expecting your customers to do the work for you. It makes customers LESS LIKELY to purchase your content in the future, and really effects your reputation as a Developer when you expect us TO PAY TO TEST YOUR GAME",1666286908,1666287235,True,590,15,0.963881015777587891,18,True,False,False

When playing the game on lower difficulties, I don't see it being more difficult than COTW and I've played now hundreds of hours on both. Way of the Hunter has much more realistic and immersive animal movement, behaviors, and patterns. The graphics are close to if not at least on par with COTW, but IMO the graphics aren't the largest concern in a hunting game. When you can really get into a game, the graphics aren't generally something you really worry about. Pretty much all games have stunning graphics these days compared to a decade ago, so it's not the talking point it used to be. 

Overall, it's a great experience. The game has FAR more than COTW did at it's initial launch. Does it compare to the amount of content in COTW at its present state? Yes and no. There are more story missions and tasks which I feel have been well executed. There are loads of animals on both maps, and the maps are absolutely MASSIVE. Far more expansive the any COTW maps thus far, and in my general opinion, far more realistic in terms of layout. Really, really well done maps. 

9/10 would recommend to any COTW players or anyone looking to get into a good hunting game. 

Also, the devs are really on top of things. Releasing updates regularly and most recently added a new rifle pack, which was free of charge. 10/10 for the devs over this game. They listen to the community and take feedback.",1666177093,1666177093,True,3,0,0,0,True,False,False

One day I made a shot on a moose that was quartering away and felt good about it. The moose went up and over a ridge and I went looking. Found a trail and long story short after trailing it for a great deal of time I ran out of trail and had to give it up. Many hours and missions later I'm walking a trail and see a moose that seems like it will fit a quest. I watch it for awhile but it's facing straight away and I can't change my angle. I spot another very large male in the trees and its quartering toward. I'm stoked. I'm prone and place a good shot with the new Rem 700.    The moose walked a slow step, then laid down.  I go check the harvest to see if it makes the quest and it does (4 star) but I'm perplexed by the shot replay. It looks like the animal was shot from back right, not front left.  Well darned if this wasn't the same moose I couldn't find several game days earlier.  The shot hit two leg bones near the 'elbow' and then a rib while the moose was mid step and the bullet went little further. My 'second' shot was all heart from the front right.    Call me simple but that really impressed me and I found closing that loop, even on a digital animal very satisfying.   Im keen to keep having these types of immersive play experiences, and am looking forward to the games further development. Maybe some Sako/Tikka hardware?",1666148616,1666148616,True,1,0,0,1,True,False,False

I personally enjoy the hunt from a stand of which I can lay down food plots, corn, brand, and hangup trail cams. What sets this apart from COW is the genetic system, animal actions/reactions, gun play, and gear work. I love the complexity of not being able to just run around shooting everything, but actually being able to control a herd as a hunter. Also the tracking, and blood system is extravagant. So yes it is worth the money with improvements, and more updates already in action. 

P.S- To the developers please add trail cams, and feeders/food plots/mineral blocks.

As of right now it was certainly worth the price! Below is a breakdown:

Graphics- They are great for the genre. Im on a potato PC and it runs fine on high. On a real PC they would be stellar.

Gameplay- Feels more natural than CoTW. Smooth, keybinds make sense, easy to pick up and play. They did well with the hunter sense. It allows you to have good control of how easy or hard you want your experience to be. There are 4 difficulty levels, each progressing with their own challenges. Well done on the gameplay devs.

Character Customization/Perk upgrades- The character customization(in all games with this genre) needs help. I think having a variety of outfits or gear you can equip would help push this even further past other games of the genre. Wont knock the game too hard for it though, the gameplay makes up for it mostly. The perks are nice. Enought o work at, but not too many to swamp you with options or the ability to create a ""Meta"". Just play and you unlock them.

Bugs- Havent run into too many yet. Nothing gamebreaking or upsetting/rage quit inducing. Well done for this day in age. We will certainly see fixes coming out im sure. They have been on top of it so far.

Gear Options- This is probably my biggest gripe as of now. I LOVE the fact they put in real firearms and brands. There are just not many right now. Only a month in, yes, but unless things are released on a regular basis it will get old. Yall really have a good chance of giving us great variety. Please dont disappoint! My biggest sad moment was realizing there are no bows. But im sure we will see that change sooner than later. Cant wait to see what they add!

Sound- This one needs some work. The jeep sounds like its a big low boy semi. The wind and water can be quite loud at times and quite quiet at others, but im sure the patch will be out soon! 

Animals- From what I have seen so far, they have really done well with animal behavior and herd mentality. The animals look great, and the way you happen upon some without further discovering them was awesome(Moose). The reaction to animals being shot is a great touch, and the sounds the animals make are also well done. I was going to be most skeptical about this aspect, but they did a very good job.

Misc- The cabin is nice. The functions in the cabin are cool and I love the feel of it. The cabin may need to be optimized because i drop frames when around it(May just be me though). I feel like they should have made the mount locations editable, but i wont complain too hard about it all. The rest of the game makes up for it. 

TL;DR- Great game for its first month, definitely worth the price to support the devs. Small complaints but nothing to overshadow the all around success of the game, If you like hunting, buy the thing.",1663522576,1665455212,True,1,0,0.508335351943969727,0,True,False,False

I like that you have to work a little bit harder to find the animals and all around just be smarter with your sound and scent. It can get pretty frustrating sometimes. Walking for a hour real time and can‚Äôt find a single animal, but that‚Äôs what keeps the game interesting. You never know when you will hear that stick break or the doe let out a call. I really like how you get to pick and choose how your herds grow. It‚Äôs nice when you come up on a herd and all you see is 3-4 giant bucks with great potential. It has been hard to get all the herds to that point but with time you slowly ween the small guys out. 

Game definitely has it hand full of bugs but they are working on them. They have already fixed a few things. Hoping they add a few things along the way such as movable tree stands, non typical animals, spotting scopes.  

For all the people out there wanting bows I don‚Äôt know how a bow in this game will ever work. Not saying it would be impossible but it would basically be impossible. You can barley get within 100yds of an animal without spooking them. With movable tree stand I could maybe see it working if you can set yourself about 40yds off a trail but still don‚Äôt think a bow would be ideal in this game.

- Animals don't have wallhack and see you for two kilometers through hills, mountains and thick woods
- Bullet travel through the animals body is very nice and detailed
- Following blood trails is actually challenging and not just following the big bright glowing tracks
- Animals once spooked don't magically come back after 5 minutes as if nothing happened
- Gunshots sound like actual gun shots and not like pellet guns
- Recoil is way more realistic
- Heards are way way way more nicer done
- The whole animal models and movements are very nicely done
- Coming back to blood tracks again: I like that there is a visual difference between blood, like ""red"", ""purple"", ""with air bubbles"", etc.
- Storyline so far is beautiful
- More I can't remember now

Cons so far:
- The .338 has no shot sound
- Many missions follow this pattern: Travel 10 minutes to a point, do something by pressing E, fast travel back

What I hope for in the future:

- Bullet tip options. Maybe let me manufacture my own ammunition where I can choose the casing, powder and tip myself?
- Gun cleaning and tuning options
- More fast travel points would be nice",1665331229,1665331229,True,2,0,0.511984288692474365,0,True,False,False

    After beating the game I can say that I am a skilled hunter (I don't just suck at hunting and I'm complaining) but I can also say with certainty this is not worth the purchase price of 40$ USD. Here's a full list with my opinions why.
     1. You have to take 10 minutes to find animals and another 15 minutes to crawl into position for 1 kill and you may not even kill it or it may end up getting scared off anyway. When hunting animals get scared off from REALLY far distances, Its way to real. These are one of those things that make you want to uninstall right away. 
     2. Multiplayer is bad! People getting disconnected, map is very buggy, game is laggy, and 90% of the time if you try and sell the animal you shot, it bugs and you just don't get anything for it. 
     3. I'll look around with the best scope in the game and see animals over 500 meters away and other times they don't render in until you've basically already scared them off at less than 200 meters. What is the use of having these amazing scenic mountaintop views over 1km of distance IF YOU CANT SEE THE ANIMALS THERE. 
    4. You always hear noises from animal that you recognize in the distance but when you go in that direction they aren't always there. (random nature calls?)
    5. Finished the story in 2 days, it was very bland and did not feel accomplishing or exciting to do. Also the characters are just very weird, including your own character. All the characters are extremely emotional and the conversations just don't feel authentic like what you would expect them to do or say in certain situations.
    6. LACK OF ANIMALS. even before I finished the game I noticed there was very few animal variety and once I finished there was nothing to look forward to. 
    7. Lack of guns, shop, gold balance. Not much to spend your money on, hardly any guns or things to purchase in the shop, and I'd like to touch on the gold balancing. I can spend 1 hour real time hunting and killing a moose and get 100-300gold for the kill when you start but do a 2minute side mission to collect papers and get 1000gold. This is not a fulfilling feeling.
    8. Shotguns suck, I spent over 6 hours real time on a lesser scaup mission (basically a duck) because the shotgun is so inconsistent and you have to crawl to them because like everything else they get scared from ridiculous distances for a game.
    9. The game has discoverable feeding, sleeping, and drinking grounds for animals but doesn't tell you what time they do those things once you've discovered it. So you'll go there knowing you discovered a location they're at ""Often, the game says"" and they're not there. 
   10. The car is sometimes slow on flat ground and sometimes fast?? This is inconsistent for no reason and its worth noting that hunting is so dreadful to do that, the fastest and honestly most enjoyable way to play is to ride around and chase animals with your car like it's GTA and hop out and shoot them...If you tried to kill the ""intended way"" you'll drive yourself crazy on 1 kill or just do it in 30seconds in the car.

With all that said, It CAN be a very fun game but it needs a lot of updates to be worth 40$. In its current state, I would just not even recommend buying it when they're other games half the price but already completed. (We all know the one).

Its not perfect( some minor bugs and crashes) but it really delivers a realistic hunting experience: the maps are well done big enough to feel like you explore the wilderness but not so big as to be empty/overwhelming. The sound of the wind in the branches, insects buzzing around, birds chirping in the distance add to the immersion. Animals are well done, not a huge variation but they move and look great, they scare easy and you need patience to track, observe and get close to them. The animals are too resilient, too tough, in my opinion, even after a double lung(vital) shot, they still run for hundreds of meters. Gun handling and ballistics are one of the best i've seen in hunting games, with detailed damage models on animal anatomy, the weapon selection is a bit limited but you get 90% of the  rifle calibers that real hunters use anyway, and once you get a good rifle and scope you don`t really need another. There are also hunter perks and skills than you can level up just by playing the game, full story campaign, aspects of ethical hunting(using the right gun calibre for a specific animal) trophies and taxidermy.

1. Collision/environmental traps where player gets stuck on trees or slight depressions in the terrain. (able to become unstuck from trees by going prone only).

2. Binocular view becomes stuck and can only be resolved through several mouse clicks to exit binocular view.

3. Badgers and foxes react unrealistically to player presence. Able to walk up on badgers and foxes and look them in the face/shoot them point blank. Badgers run around player as if the player does not exist.

4. Some terrain has not been meshed properly, creating instances of boulders, trees and badger lairs that are floating in space or mountains with blank spaces beneath them.

5. Animals react unrealistically with vehicle. I agree that occasionally animals can be run over by vehicles as has occurred in game, however, to have three foxes run in front of the vehicle consecutively with two being turned into road kill is a bit much. Physics with the vehicle is unrealistic when flying animals like the pheasant accidentally fly into the vehicle. When the pheasant hits the vehicle it reacts as if a 10 ton jet rammed into it and the vehicle flips and spins.

As it stands, the game is good, but but not better than The Hunter game. A bit more tweaking, and it will a peer of that game and may actually surpass it.",1664745318,1664745318,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Where Way of the Hunter doesn't do anything awful, it also doesn't do anything well. The game is the definition of a ""meh"" title. Overall, Way of the Hunter feels like a bland hunting game that did its best to imitate a more well rounded title.

The gun play feels off and I don't know how the developer managed that. My rounds always land low, no matter how much time I spend ranging the target, adjusting zero, and steadying my shot. The firearm selection is very limited as well, and I'm guessing its so developers can flush it out later through DLC. 

The hunter sense needs some work as well. I feel like it could benefit from giving players the option to assign colors to different markers, i.e. droppings, blood, prints, sound cues, and deceased animals. The hunter sense gets confusing while tracking a blood trail and the exact same flashing effect is displayed for everything on screen. Not to mention the default color for the hunter sense is yellow, and blends in with the light greens and tans of the grass.

The amount of money you need to purchase hunting certificates for different zones feels odd too. Not in the sense that they added something you need to work for, but because of the conservation aspect. If you kill too many animals, then the population on the map lowers. This feels counter productive for game play, since you need to kill animals to make money, but then that lowers the number of animals within certain zones on map. 

The last thing about the game that strikes me as odd is how few fast travel points are on the map. I don't want to skip all over the map, but I also don't want to spend 30 minutes walking to a feeding zone.

After climbing a steep learning curve, I've come to see this as a fantastic effort. The simulation of persistent and evolving animal herds, and their AI behavior, is brilliant. The ballistics modeling and effects on targets is really impressive (though it makes me wish for more ammunition choices, though maybe this is to be added later). Even the blood trail/tracking system is relatively deep and compelling.

But it's quite *complex*, and the in-game tutorial/training really doesn't do much to explain the intricacies to you. But to succeed, you need to understand them. As a result, you'll have to dig into the encyclopedia to learn how many joules of energy are appropriate to take down various animals, and to realize your ""hunter sense"" used through a scope tells you how many joules you'll be delivering with the ammo you have equipped at the range you're targeting. There's a lot of buried complexity like that (it's never even explicitly explained that you're dealing with complex herds, that persist and evolve over time - let alone how to manage them - as opposed to individual spawned animals).

The end result is this game is hard, even at ""normal"" difficulty. Coming off a game like CotW, you might be put off by how hard it is. But if you stick with it and recognize that it's much more of a robust simulation, it's worth the effort. CotW is escapist and fun, even casual. This is more more immersive and intense (and at times admittedly frustrating). 

A few other notes: The animals look terrific. The foliage and overall graphical fidelity of the landscape is quite good and an improvement over CotW, and the reserves are immense, but overall I feel CotW's reserve designs actually feel more realistic and regionally specific (though it's a subtle thing). There are some absolutely spectacular vistas, but in general mountains here are a bit too steep, the ways in which the player is cordoned into regional ""bowls"" are fairly obvious and feel much more ""gamey"" than a natural environment would (and which CotW avoids quite well). So as a ""take a brief walking vacation to Alaska or New Zealand"" experience, I actually prefer CotW's level design. As a hunting sim, Way of the Hunter is spectacular. And there's still so much room for expansion and enhancement, I really hope it experiences similar success. (Also, though the ""River Knox"" stuntman background is cringeworthy, the mission system/story elements are nicely done.)",1664132756,1664132756,True,4,0,0.512195110321044922,0,True,False,False

I have played 129 hours and still have not left the first map. There is so much more to go to, to see and experience, and I only opened up one closed hunting location and purchased a second. It feels like I'd be cheating on the America map if I spent much time in Transylvania. It is that good and that big.

Hunting: I love this. Animals do not leave tracks all over the place, they just leave tracks mostly on their trails. On occasion where the soil is wet you may find a rare track there. Sneak up slowly on a high spot and you will see the animal off in the distance. I will never forget each time I see a male resting while the herd is eating and then suddenly jerk it's head around to bite at an insect biting him. Such a majestic creature. Eating behavior is wonderful, animations are wonderful, herd management I absolutely love, and when you shoot a deer the animation is different for each animal. Yes you shoot a moose in the heart and like in real life it still doesn't know it is dead and will walk a little bit. 

Tracking blood trails is fun but it is a real challenge at night. You have the hit zone where you find out how badly hurt is the animal. Then you have long blood trails where the animal dripped blood, brushed against a shrub a smeared blood, and if you can see the deer you will see it occasional lay down and rest. Go up to it too soon and it will spook and run again. I also found an area where it looked like the deer was nearing it's death as it walked in circles, peed and pooped several times, but then moved on.

Now that bad: this was not a production game ready for publication. It is sad because with Call of the Wild being so bad with it's bugs we did not need another game released with so many bugs and missing features. For example, this was released for the PC but only contained help for using a controller. We had to wait for a bug fix to get the keyboard key assignments. But I still cannot map my one desire: to hit M and see the map. And while the bug fixes are coming fast and furious, much better than Call of the Wild, they still have situations where it seems they put out a fix and it creates a new bug. I hope this is not an architecture issue but simply a developer making a bad decision that got past QA.

On the good side, you can sign up to get the beta code so you can test and provide feedback before it goes to release. This was added after the second bug fix (the first fixing save issues for the Playstation which occurred 3 days after the bugs were reported) which unfortunately introduce more bugs with the fix. 

So I would say that we purchased what was to be a release version that really was an early release version and should have been stated as such. But it is far more ready for release than many of the buggy situations Call of the Wild was in.",1660764592,1664058237,True,1,0,0.485498100519180298,0,True,False,False

Thing is, at 15km, it gives you a skill that makes your crouch speed slightly faster, while also making it slightly louder. I don't like that, I would much prefer a RPG like system when you get talent points and can choose where you put them. CotW has them beat in this aspect.

This game gives me that which I don't have the luxury of at the moment, and that is the sense of the big outdoors in all its glory.  WoTH has come closer in my little experience, than the other, I won't mention, at transporting me into the scenic expanse of nature, its beauty, and all the surreal creatures that inhabit it (please keep'em coming Nine Rocks Games).

The views are grand, with tall grass, trees, and plenty of streams, lots to fall asleep sitting here, to be awakened by your first Elk not 100 yards away.  The Elk's sound was unique, it was clear, and the directional sound from her was precise. I got so excited waking up to it all that I failed to note the gender.

I parked the jeep somewhere and have been walking when I'm not fast traveling, and that I only do to get ahead of the wind direction.  WoTH is simply good wilderness.  The fine-tuning will come, it is not critical now.  The sound of a big game stalking you?  No worries.  No need to run to a clearing or fast travel out... it's just the Badgers.  I'm sure their sounds will be tweaked down in time.  A dead Badger is a quiet Badger.

The firearm ballistics and summary are awesome.  The firearms, though not many at the moment, are well done.  Their accuracy is well done.  Target hits confirm impact motion, and blood splatter, before you even lower the rifle.  Your scope comes with a built-in spotter, to provide intel to compensate for wind speed and direction.  Hunter's Sense tells us newbs to hunting, the intel that experienced IRL hunters probably have a six sense for, like did I hit a vital organ, and if so how far will he travel before collapsing, and which way he is going.  Want to do it the expert hunter way, you can turn off Hunter's Sense.  Still need a greater challenge, default is medium difficulty, so bump it up to the hard mode.  For me, the Adventurer it's easy mode until I'm pro-WoTH.

Keep the non-collision stuff as they are, for there would be so much to trip on, get snagged on, stuck on that we would miss the forest, for hitting all the stumps and logs.  It would be nice to climb a rock or incline a tree limb for a better view or to use it as a firing perch (I think you can on some rocks now, but not fallen tree limbs...still testing this).  This is a good shooter...very good shooter!  Be conservative on your criticisms for now, and credit the good Nine Rocks Gaming has done here.  We can't take the result of [strike] 8[/strike] 5 years of work and expect them to do the same upon release.  That is just wrong.  And bad riding shotgun.

Nine Rocks Gaming, you have done well here...real good!  You have laid the foundation for a superb masterpiece.  As they say in the building trades, ""Measure twice and CUT ONCE!!!""  Please take this to heart and mind with the patches, upgrades, and DLCs.  Personally, this gamer will be purchasing any DLCs forthcoming, except vehicles.  I wanna be on foot, to experience every 'i' dotted and 't' crossed.  Good Show!!!  Keep It REAL!

Just happened upon a CoTW Youtuber I sub to, who is also here in WoTH.  Noting the rifle he is using, he has some time in game.  I really had to link his video, as it truly highlights the awesomeness of  WoTH.  His narrations are top notch alone.  Here he points out the beauty and detail of WoTH.  I so loved the vocals and animations of the 2nd Elk as he does the bugling.  This deserves exemplary recognition to Nine Rock Games.

first i would recommend not to give much on reviews which base on a few hours playtime ;-)
My first hunt took me over an hour...
Than i will not sum up all nice and bad things here and only share the things which are still important for me after this playtime.
I run the game with a I9 (low cpu usage) and a GTX1080 (cooking hot water) on 3440x1440 all at max/Ultra with 35-60 fps. If i reduce grass foliage or set 2560x1440 its from 45-60.
Difficulty level was second highest (Hunter mode) which gives you hunter sense with help when tracking the blood trail and finding animals/herd positions. If a update improve the sound from animals so you can be sure of direction + we get a dog for searching than i switch to Ranger mode (highest) but for now i feel the game and me not ready for this.

1) After 600hours of playing CotW the buy of WotH season pass was a must have for me and expectations were high.
Disappointment was also a bit high when i saw a great part looking and working like in cotw + a lot of features which are still not there or not ready (Multiplayer).
Installing was fast (under 15GB) and it runs from first day until now nice and smooth except some short reload stutters when in the Jeep or on the run. The 5-8 ""fatal errors"" i got (and most of the players too) were fixed with a patch; no problems after that in terms of stability. There are a few players who have problems with newer Nvidia cards 20-30 series who complain of low GPU usage and therefore low fps and stutters. Idk if this is solved now. 
The setup of the game is straight forward and a Tutorial which every player has to do helps. First there were no ability to set your own key bindings but now with the patch they implementet this beside the Controller input.

2) What i like and keeps me playing on even after so much hours :
The immersive feeling in a hunt.
The animal animations and behaviour and their difference in look (older get a bit more gray or shiny fur).
The nature looks to me more real. You can find places were you only like to watch.
Observing the herds at their walk or rest is sometimes more nice than shoot a animal.
The herd management allows you to shoot older and weaker ones and improve herd genes overall in time. Callers help you.
The shooting is a bit a mixed bag but all in all i like it. I¬¥m not a long range shooter as many others and more the hunter who try to go close and enjoy his success when placing a shot from 50-130m.
I like the detailed hunting screen with animal organs and arterys (kill cam) and all in all the way they created it by using the energy (joule) which hits the animal+the size of the bullet (caliber) which creates a smaller or bigger whole and expanding area.
In short; a bad placed shot even with a suiting caliber can make the animal run and flee so you cant find it and it will stay alive . But the next day   you are able to call it (caller) with a perk (call old in bad condition males) and finally hunt it. In the hunt screen you will find both shots and can analize them.
On the other hand you were greatly awarded with instant or nearly instant kills when hitting the heart, or main artery or both ; sometimes double lung+artery does the same. The variety is good and sometimes animals run 10-100m and lay down but they ar not dead yet (as in real). They are exhaustet due to lung shot. If you run to them to fast they spook and run again and lay down again....some are dead, some perhaps take off another short trip. I got a bear which did this 3 times.
These, and some other pure hunting features are make me still playing this game/sim and with time and Addons it could only be better !

3) What i dont like or what is left:
sound....there¬¥s still work to do. f.e. In the hardest ""Ranger"" mode you have only your headphones to get the direction of animals...and this does often ot work right or you cant sort it out.
Spooking animals can be easily done at long range (250m) even when you are only walk and when other environment sounds should overshadow your own...perhaps rain or storm.
No variety of different cartridges or bullet weighs/tips for the rifles (hopefully they include later).
Animals are 100% blind....if you call them it could be they run onto your feet if you stay still.
Due to this its completely unimportant if you lay down in grass, or stand straight up exposed or hide behind a rock or tree.....no animal will notice you....until you move ! They only hear you. 
Animals hear you through hilly terrain direct distance and not over the top with long distance which you have to walk !
I dont like the easyness of zeroing your rifle to different ranges....its just arcade to press a key and its setup for 50, 100,150,200, 300....meters. There are shooting ranges at every map (2 huge maps ) but you cant adjust your own rifle with your own scope and different ammonition....big minus and a lot of hunting fans and real hunters would have like to see that !!
Scopes does NOT zoom in only the scope sight; no they went also here the cheap way and your whole screen is zoomed in.
The ""dwarf sight"" of the hunter  is the same as in cotw and it sucks big time ! 
A lot of filters for after study your huntings are not there. f.e. i huntetd now 275 animals in 200hours but i cant filter f.e. all red deers or all foxes or all heart shots or all 3stars or 5 star trophy¬¥s whatsoever .....they are still listet.

Game is not finished and has room for huge improvements to make it a really great sim but is 100% playable and people who are focused in hunting alone will like it.

Also, I asked a refund and Steam refund process is garbage. It crash as soon as I send it saying that I should try again. Witch I did 3 times now and it still crash. I hate to lose my time and this whole thing is a huge lost of my time.

Steam doesn't refund me as they say that I played more than 2 hours of the game. This suck, as the game still shouldn't have been release as this is not a full game and it is full of glitch.

Playtime: 24h

Pros:
- Finally good viewing range, that one would expect in a hunting game
- Animal needs zones, tracks (like COTW, but less messy)
- Hunting cabins, jeeps, fast-travel, Hunting stand, POIs
- Wind. Scent + weather system 
(thunderstorm & lightning, a lot better than in COTW, but still needs polishing)
- Animal life cycle (growing, developing, result depending on genetics, and natural death) -> awesome idea !!
- Animals can heal over time, when you just wound them ""sub-optimally"", as in RL
- Very good display of shot penetration through body and organs. Very detailed for a game.
- Blood color variations, depending on organ hit
- Blood trail even on bushes, like in RL

Cons or bugs: (state of now)
- Surround sounds need polishing. Insects partially too loud. Others not well positioned or too loud for the distance to the creating object.
- The blood splatter is quite good, but in sunshine, it can become impossible to find. 
(At times, with bright sun, the tracking was harder, than in RL ! ;-)  )
- 1 crash in 24h of gameplay (while driving)
- There's tree and bush combinations, where you'll get stuck forever, when going towards it.
  2 times stuck at a tree (in 24h), but fast-travel ""fixes"" it. If you know it, you can avoid it. Just keep a bit of distance from tangled looking trees and big branch combinations. Most of it is fine.

Ideas and feedback for devs:
Real hunter here (europe)
- There's meaningless ambient sound effects, sounding like hissing or warning sounds, that's confusing.
Could you maybe differentiate a bit, take the ambient sounds down a notch, softer, calmer, so that there's a bigger difference to relevant sounds ?
- More hunting stands please. Or add mobile ones, like in COTW
- more weapons and equipment, but I'm sure that's already on your list ;-)

Possible features for the future:
- Bears and wolves could attack (some conditions). I know, in RL hunting, that doesn't happen often, but still, it's exciting to know, that there's a chance.
- Moose easily charge people, that should be a chance, with damage
- Moose and Elk, they surely insure you, when they trample over you in a panic or just because.
- On animal life cycle. Add one more stage (old), which is slower. I've seen quite a few of those in RL. Darker fur, slowly walks away even when you're there. And let it die somewhere, maybe eaten wolf and fox, like in RL. Attracting predators, let the carcass vanish after a few days.
- Ethical hunting also means, small fawns, and you make sure, you don't kill a mother, while the fawns need her, so you scout for that.
- Some birds will ""complain"", when you or a predator comes by. 
- You could improve the shot/hit realism: E.g. Lung or liver shot are not the same every time.
1. some shots kill by nerve shock, even when not hitting the heart
2. sometimes the internal bleeding is fast, sometimes not
3. sometimes the deer travels far, another time it just stands there, goes down and rests, until it dies.
Ethical hunting also means, you don't pursue the animal right after the shot, so it can die in peace without panic.

Verdict:
I'm a fan of COTW and wasn't sure about this one. But it's worth buying in my opinion. Quite refreshing.
This game has awesome potential. Cheers",1663443432,1663443432,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

1288320,122383450,76561198058427368,0,42,936,0,266,1695514980,"Way of the Hunter provides a more authentic hunting experience than Call of the Wild, which is really in the only modern hunting game alternative, but doesn't have as much gameplay polish and variety. 

As soon as you enter Way of the Hunter, you're greeted with classic Western rock music and are given a free vehicle and hunting lodge that actually exists in each map where you can display all of your trophies hunted there. Even the opening cut scene lets you know that this game was developed by actual hunters. The whole game is reminiscent of the old Cabelas ones. It's not trying to needlessly extort money from you (it doesn't cost money to sleep, etc) and is just trying to give you a fun and realistic experience. Also, the story mode isn't filled with pretentious racism directed at the game's key demographic. It's all a breath of fresh air if you're coming from Call of the Wild. 

The animals behave much more realistically and the hunts are more difficult, even on the medium setting. For example, animal senses are sharper and if you spook them at a need zone then they won't return until about 12 hours later. The ballistics are fantastic too. Bullet expansion and velocity at the time of impacting each individual organ (they slow the further they penetrate) changes how effective your shot is on an animal. 

The only downside is that there's much less content at the time of writing this since it's a brand new game. No bows, handguns, portable blinds, tents, and only 2 maps. but there's still many hours of gameplay. The maps are huge and you can already hunt bear, deer, moose, fox, wolf, duck, pheasant, badger, mountain goat, boar, and much more. Also the gameplay mechanics could use more polish. While the animal sound effects are more realistic than Call of the Wild, the sound isn't directional and you'll need to rely on Hunter Sense to know which way they come from. Also they can be a little glitchy, with environmental sounds randomly popping in and out. Also the graphics aren't as good and everything seems a little pixelated. 

All that said, it's totally worth the price of admission. If they keep improving gameplay, adding content, and DLC, then there won't ever be a reason to return to Call of the Wild.",1663431180,1663431180,True,3,1,0.518168091773986816,0,True,False,False

(From a fellow software developer) kudos to the authors.

I compare it to CotW which I played a lot and the Way of the Hunter is more simulator where CotW is more ""arcade"".
In CotW one can run after animals, do what with I call ""push"" hunting, pushing animals in front and shooting them when they reach open space, etc., all completely unrealistic.
In Way of the Hunter (I play hunter difficulty, so animals are skittis), one has to spend time waiting, be aware of surroundings, take cover, ... . One shoots significantly less and waits significantly more in Way of the Hunter. Much closer to real world.

What is better depends on player preferences.
I like sim so I ended up playing Way of the Hunter.

Everything seemed to happen too fast, from announcement to release date, and not much info. Still, it was a new hunting game, and it looked beautiful. Could it be the refresh in hunting games that I was looking for, after some 900h in Call of the Wild? The first streams got me more optimistic. Got the game on pre-order.

After some 50h playing it, I'm glad I did. It is a solid hunting game. Don't take it as a Call of the Wild with 2022 visuals. This is a new experience. Seems more realistic, and I appreciate the design choices and differences from previous well-stablished hunting games. If you are coming from CotW, expect a more difficult and rewarding hunting experience. If you never played a game like this before, this may be the game that will make you fall in love with the genre. Patience is a must, but it should come naturally, as you lose yourself in the quiet forests and fields of Idaho and Transylvania, the two initial maps (more to come as DLC).

It's not a light game, nor it's too heavy, I guess. It will require a robust system if you intend to play at 4k. The game is being optimized by patches, though, and DLSS is in the roadmap for the near future, if you have the hardware to support it.

Developers are active in the official Discord server, they do listen to feedback, and seem passionate about their project. A good sign, that hopefully will pass the test of time.

I have 230 hours into the game and  enjoy the complex and diverse worlds that are provided. Running water, streams and waterfalls, creaking trees,  etc create an atmosphere that is pleasant. The animal models are well done from antlers to twitching tails. 

Running around will get you no animals, except for some road kill. You need   explore the map, scout for animal signs and plan your hunt. I particularly like that herds have multiple, resting feeding and drinking times. Usage of the zones is very dynamic, and appear to be affected my a number of factors including spooking. The game requires some strategy and tactics to have a successful hunt.

The game has an interesting herd management feature. Harvesting low fitness animals can improve trophies, depending on how well you cull.

The games does have some issues that has drawn so,e criticism. Sticking to trees (even managed to stick my jeep to one, yes  poor driving on a hairpin corner, multiplayer does done appear to work (not tried yet but looking forward to hunting and chatting with friends, bullet proof light and heavy foliage ( I wait for a good clear shot, and spooking distance for animals. In my game play, none of these have affected my enjoyment and mostly a good laugh. I do agree it was released too soon but was impressed with developers jumping on the most severe problems. Not making us wait until the next content release.

Love the game, and addicted to playing. I have a few more tasks to complete and will work on 5 star animals. Much more of the map yet to explore. I recommend  for those who want more than run and gun.

Unfortunately, it is a bit of a hot mess with glaring bugs and instability, with some people actively losing their save files after Fatal Error crashes. The game seems like it was shoved into the deep end of the pool before it knew how to swim. Also, before the recent patch, there wasn't even a way to remap key binds. In a supposed computer game.

Still, if not for these issues, Way of The Hunter would be a great game. Fortunately, the developers are seemingly on the ball with updates, a roadmap, and a new beta development branch to test hotfixes and upcoming patches. If they deliver on everything, talk about a redemption arc.

Look, at the end of the day, I like it despite everything. I wish Steam didn't force recommendations Because I do, and don't, recommend it.

Especially at the beginning it is fun to find the animals, to follow the tracks, to stalk the prey. Unfortunately, this gets worse as the game progresses, since it is necessary to approach the animals over long distances at very slow speed, or you have to wait a long time in the hunting station for the prey to appear.

The main missions are astonishingly varied and in addition to pure hunting jobs, include various search missions in which you can learn something about the past or meet interesting new characters. On the other hand, there are some hunting jobs that take an unnecessarily long time to find a suitable hunting ground and wait for the prey.

I would have been happy about a few hidden easterggs in the game world. I miss the ability to customize the game character's appearance, clothing, or home. Unfortunately, glitches or game crashes sometimes occur when playing.

Very big open world map. I haven't even gotten very far into it but every where I explore or even come back to spots I recently visit, I'm still amaze at the views. The game is graphically stunning. It's not the best but it's not something that will make you steer away. I do get slower FPS compared to COTW but I think that's due to the draw distance. You can see a lot further compared to COTW. You definitely need to take a vehicle or fast travel.

And the animals! I don't know how many varieties there are but there seem to be quite a bit. I like the herd management aspect of this game. I don't know if 2 different herd will group together but being able to remember the herd I was hunting and looking forward to take down that big boy that you've been saving is definitely cool. That's actually what hunter do in real life too if they want to produce trophies year round. And they age and reproduce... according to the makers. They die and disappear too if you're too late on that trophy. They also have unique racks as well.

Hunting gears. I guess you can say they have the essentials. There are stuff missing. Having more different caliber rifles and more brands would be nice. Caliber rounds are set into tier but not all tier group of calibers would be the same. The game is quite detail as you can check the velocity and bullet drop of each caliber in the in game encyclopedia. So using a lower tier round on a higher tier animal is still very possible and won't affect hunter scores/rating. It's all on how ethical the kill was. Hopefully in future updates, they will give more gears choices. I am hoping for bows and with that, a tree stand to go along with it. I would like to see revolvers, shotguns, rifles, muzzleloaders, crossbows, blinds... All the good stuff!

Any hunting game I prefer to hunt as realistic as possible. My style is definitely more slow pace and not gun blazing. And with herd management in the game, I definitely will practice more selective harvesting. Slowly tracking and not shooting everything on sight. I also play on a harder setting, but the hardest setting will make it pretty tough. I prefer my ""Hunter Sense"" which is a game ability to make tracking easier, but hardest difficulty setting will be a must play eventually.

Game from the start has been a better more realistic experience than call of the wild in my opinion and I was even sceptical at first. 

the story enables you a lovely way to enter into the game but don't feel you're tied to that if you don't want to be. The animals seem a lot more realistic in there behaviours and dont dart around at 200mph like in COTW. 

 I will write a more formal review in the coming weeks but wanted to say to anyone sceptical as I was about buying it. Ive not regretted it at all. I know the games going to get better which builds me with even more hope. 

UPDATE****** 14/09/2022

Ok over 12 hours in now and I restarted once I thought id got the hang of it generally. Wow what can I say. I'm more patient now and waiting around for longer and being slightly better hunting disciplined is really paying off. The game I feel is gong from strength to strength and I can only hope for more in the future. There are still the occasional things that grind on me. One being when I've been tracking a larger animal particularly Moose and they find they're way into a bush, sometimes they become invisible and you can clearly see an outline but they're graphically clashing with the bush, in reality their outline would still be there to try and get a shot on target.",1661891048,1663184545,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Okej, I love it. Just had to get rid of the hunter sense. I only play in Ranger now. This makes this game fantastic. I still feel like they should boost kick in the guns a bit

OLD review:

Why I cant enjoy it like call of the wild : 

* Hunting sence  - why??? Totally destroys the feeling of just enjoying the view. Now you have to push that freaking buttton all the time and the screen gets dark. why?? Just let us see the clues in normal view like in call of the wild

* No power to the shots. You just don¬¥t get that feeling of firing a big gun like you do in call of the wild. This is so important when playing a hunting game. you need that feeling of power ,smoke and sound . 

* You get all the gear in 15 hours.  In call of the wild you have to work for months to get anything. Here you have it all in just a couple of hours. Why?? Let players work hard to get new things.  Thats what keeps it fun

* Perks / skills  - here you just get things all the time. You don¬¥t get to choose . You dont even know when you get them. In call of the wild , skills are everything. You work for ever to get new skills . Thats what makes it fun. 

* No great feeling of progress , in call of the wild you love the sound the game makes when you progress through missions . Here you barely get a notice when you passed a mission. Not fun . Why no XP ? In hunting games you have to work for something to make it fun and interesting

I wanted to love this game but I can¬¥t. Im going back to call of the wild .",1662237981,1663165233,True,0,0,0.471609175205230713,3,True,False,False

2.	Views are stunning
3.	Guns and animations are on a different level
4.	Animal behaviour is very good much better than Call of the wild
5.	The attention to detail is outstanding
Cons:
1.	Unless you're hosting DO NOT play multi player. (Host Advantage is insane) i.e you cant unlock discoverable items unless the host has discovered them and even then it doesn't always unlock them for you.
2.	Kills become invisible at times.
3.	Hunter sense doesn't always work.
4.	Your car is destroyed very very easily.
5.	It occasionally de-spawns you.
6.	Multiplayer needs ALOT of work.
7.	If your online with a friend and you both shoot the same animal no-one can claim it.
8.	Not enough gear and equipment at the minute.
9.	Unable to purchase ammo which means if you are mid hunt and run out you need to go back to base/car to refill ammo automatically.
10.	You can get stuck on the smallest of rocks and have to respawn.
11.    Unable to unlock the discovery locations in multiplayer 50% of the time
12. Photo mode doesnt work which is crucial if you want the collectibles
I understand its a new game and will give it more time but at the minute being online with friends is very hit and miss

First off the game runs well, running on dual 1700 GTXs it runs smooth maxed @ 4k. Coming from COTW, I can say this is a different game, at least different enough to not be in direct competition. WOTH is not as fast paced as COTW it is more of a true sim, animals spook easily well before you may even know they were there. 
Pros: 
- about as realistic as I have seen. 
- graphically good, but not system melting. 
- sound wise it is one of the most immersive experiences I have played ever. 
- thunder storms are almost a thing to behold.
- few easy kills. 
- more starting animals on each map than COTW 
-animal behavior seems much more realistic, they are not always at every need zone.
-shot overview is much better than COTW
Cons:
- bugs some fatal 
- some weird graphical choices turns game grainy 
-controls are different and some keybindings don't work as of yet.
-most frustrating bug for me is that the mouse is unresponsive entering and exiting scopes and binoculars
- while the animals look awesome in the world, I find them very disappointing in shot overview.

I'd really like to have some feedback on how visible I am, how far my scent spread is going, how loud I'm being, and other information to inform me of why when I hit stalk mode from behind a hill in a crouch standing downwind of the animals, they spook from 200m. 

I can't even get within 150m of an animal without spooking it in stalk and low crawling. Not in every case. I walk right up on a group of ducks in non-stalk mode standing up and they just merrily swim around until I shoot. It's not my presence that scared them, it's when I unload a 20g shotgun at them when the panic sets in.

If you want a hunting game, stick with COTW. The systems in this game are lacking any useful information, the spooking system is wonky to say the least. Stalk mode is a good idea, but moving slower than a glacier for 100m to get within decent shooting range and then still spooking the animal just seems like it's a way to waste a lot of time.

It's so frustratingly boring. Then again, I have the game break and I don't even know it because stalking mode will inexplicably for no reason quit showing directional sound animals are making. I can hear animals just breaking through the brush to get away from me, but stalk mode doesn't even show up the bubble things that lets you know you just scared something. Have to quit out and reload to get them to work again. Before people write it off, there's hitting Q to see tracks and directional bubbles, but hitting CTRL puts you in stalking mode so Q will show up even while moving. So yes, I know how that system works. It's not because I was accidentally leaving one or the other off.

It's a hunting game. Not a very good one, but it's a hunting game. If you don't mind the jank, go for it. I regret rebuying it to give it another chance though. I should've just taken my refund and been happy.",1662983811,1662984074,False,2,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

I watched some youtube videos and Way of the Hunter just seemed cleaner, and seemed to have way more natural animal behavior, so that was part of my decision. I feel a good portion of the negative reviews for this game are from veterans of theHunter. It's understandable. If you are invested in that game, some of the things that that game does better than this are likely to stand out as bigger flaws.

Second: I am not a hunter. I have been a few times. And there are lots of aspects of IRL hunting that really appeal to me. The amount of learning required, the patience, and just being outdoors to name a few. I just really don't like killing things. So this is great to scratch a tiny bit of that itch that I won't otherwise. 

Third: I've seen reviews and seen youtube videos where the ""ethical hunting"" aspects of this game get a snide remark or are outright attacked. Well, foremost, this angle is a game mechanic. It provides context for the difficulty and the reasons to do things a certain way. As a game mechanic, it works great. Additionally, what's the problem with ethical hunting, really? Yes, our society is in a weird spot, but ethical hunting is what is going to allow hunting enthusiasts and people who are put off by hunting to coexist. Honestly, just grow up. It's a compromise, and its also just the right thing. (getting off small soapbox).

Game plays great, runs great, and has a lovely map. The storyline is welcome, albeit a tiny bit cheesy and heavy handed. But it works.

As a hunter, I really enjoy the aspect of finding animals, in my case specifically whitetails, and watching them grow.

The missions can be tedious, but the story is interesting and many of the missions are enjoyable. It also allows the player to acquire new items, like guns and callers, without grinding too hard. Since buying this game, I haven't played much else.

Overall a great hunting game with amazing potential. The variety of weapons at launch is satisfactory, but feels lacking for people like me that like to bow hunt.

- antlers change based on the quality of the animal
- fur/hair changes based on the age of the animal
- I think the animal models/behaviours are very realistic
- devs are quick to fix (5 days to resolve after releasing patch that added some issues)
- you can count the annuli (growth) rings on horns to determine the age of the animal
- different animals have different life expectancies which changes when you should harvest different species
- you are in control of the quality of your herds. If you shoot low potential animals you improve the quality of respawns.
- different difficulties allow you to get an understanding of the game before getting rid of your handicaps. 
- you dont have to pay for ammunition
- time changes are free
- fast travel is free

I dont like:
- some slightly uneven antlers still end up being high potential animals
- firearms arent close real life, I hunt with a .243 and every deer I have ever shot the bullet has gone completely through the animal. In this game I have shot deer with much larger guns and not had the bullet pass through.
- you can shoot a 300 win mag and keep the animal in the scope during recoil.
- no way of marking an animal while switching between binoculars and scope so you sometimes shoot the wrong animal after identifying them in the binoculars
- Scopes have higher magnification than binoculars, but you must use binoculars to estimate animal potential
- you cant really track an animal unless you are following a blood trail
This game seems very slow until you get the hang of it. You should expect to spend 5 hours before understanding the game. 
I suggest:
- dont shoot females (I dont know what it does to the population, but if this is realistic each female gives you a young each year even if there is only 1 male in the herd).
- go through all the missions instead of purchasing the private access passes (saves money and makes money).
- read every encyclopedia entry as you get it
- I never shoot young, sometimes shoot 1 star adults (depending on species), always shoot 1 star mature (except for bears because they can live for something like 30 years)
- get all the campsites and cabins (fast travel points) as soon as you are in the game. Each either has a quest or adds something to your map.",1662497193,1662497193,True,2,0,0.498220652341842651,0,True,False,False

The game is good and offers a lot more animals and firearms that are actually branded. The X Ray and claim system of the game is far better. What is significantly needed is a hiding system in the grass of tree's and a scent cover.

Edit: There is supposed hiding in the grass. The bullet ballistics are very well done, such as the diamond shaped mass displacement when it comes to a bullet penetrating flesh. That mass does damage, not as severe of course, but good damage to what it touches. The bullets do much more realistic damage than Call of The Wild and it shows in both the 3D claim and the way the animal reacts then passes. The blood tracking is very clever and more detailed than Call Of the Wild, instead of just glowing mass it has realistic bleeding. The way you can see an animal moving towards is following the speckles. If you had a tear drop shape where there's a collection at the bottom and towards the top of the tear drop is separated blood with speckles, then that shows movement in the direction. Same with quick movements and change of direction with a line of blood going another way. The original shot area with the blood show's great detail such as estimated death distance and impurities which is neat. The estimation is great since it's a lot harder to find an animal you shot in a herd near a river, I lost it but searched the range it said and found it across the river after a LONG search following blood to a river where I lost him.",1662136844,1662425549,True,21,1,0.682304978370666504,0,True,False,False

After the last updated I had no crash and the performance got better.
What I see about this game is that they thought big, with a huge map in size, but didn't had enough time to make more animals and to put them in game. I believe it will happen soon. This game need more animals, in variety and number.
I do recommend this game if you have patience to walk a large amount of land without seeing any life.
The tracking system could be better, if the grass around the footprints was made lower, like a trail. It's realy difficult to see the footprints and blood with a high grass covering it. It's not real too. A Bear would make a big gap in the grass along with his footprints.
This game have a really good potential to be the best in this category.

Things that WOTH sets out to do and does better than COTW :
- Better physics of the world. The trees, the foliage, the wind and the weather flows and changes much organically.
- Better Animal behavior, physics and animations. As a Hunting game, they nailed this part down to a tee. Animals react better and move more convincingly. Trophy system and Herd management system is very welcoming.
- Nicely package game with 2 maps and all amenities without a need of paywall.
- Gun physics are better implemented, researched and have more depth than COTW. bulletdrop, hit energies and zeroing and such.
- Landscape is better designed and organically flows well from one place to another. Felt lived in.
- Much needed long distance draw distance and can spot animals up to 800ms, something a hunting game should be doing.

Overall, the main plus point of this game is how organic it feels to be hunting in the world. Tracking systems, the way to spot animals are much much more organic. In COTW, there was too much reliance on hunter mate but here you have look and mark your own way around so that you don't get lost. You have to use more of your brain organically to consider the terrain before you shoot or approach the game. There is a lot more strategy involved in hunting here than COTW which is more arcadey and straigh-foward than here.

There are minus points about this game - Those are follows.
Sound- Not as well design as COTW. The latter has one of the best sounds in any game. Gunsounds aren't as meaty and sound mixing is all over the place. Certain sounds can get very loud and some barely can hear.

Graphics - maybe it's because it's an unreal engine 4. The COTW engines looks better and runs better, partly due to the environment mechanic in COTW is quite static so they can look better as a trade-off. Framerate is an issue of contention even after the patch and it can get very wishy washy in WOTH. Sometimes it runs well. Sometimes it runs like shit. Anti-aliasing tech is quite bad too. Even at Temporal (its highest quality setting available), everything looks fuzzy as hell. The graphics just look more messy and underdeveloped. Switching this to unreal 5 might be better? I don't know I'm not in game developing to tell. It has some questionable low asset models at distance that looked like Phantom animals and seeing animals with naked eyes over at distance is very bad. Coupled that with how fuzzy the whole bloody thing looks and i couldn't help but miss COTW rather static but sharp looking world. This is major issue for me, for Graphics and I feel they need to relook at their engine or implement new change while maintaining their optimization. Oh yes, the game is poorly optimized. 

Movement Mechanics : COTW hands down have better movement design implemented. Here, not able to tell how much noise I'm making going through bushes because simply there is no sound effect or meter to back it up. There is no indication of how visible are you or camouflaging mechanic implemented like how legacy titles like Cabela Big game hunter games used to do, so it's a bit of a shame. so without indication in terms of sound effect or meter, you kinda go into bushes praying you're not compromised. 

Bugs and lack of quality of life choices at launch - For a game at full price at launch, there are some game breaking bugs  (which are being worked on btw) are no excuse and shows Nordic's experience in handling a game is quite immature. You will get frustrated with the kind of bugs you see in the game time to time. 

Overall, still the good things outweigh the bad. It is unique in its own right that it doesn't rip off COTW or Make COTW irrelevant. I'm glad i have two hunting games to rotate between now. More arcadey COTW and more semi-realistic and chill WOTH.",1662359932,1662359932,True,124,5,0.899833083152770996,7,True,False,False

Short version: This game will probably get polished and fixed... but better to wait on it for now and pick it up cheap in a Steam Sale when it's finished.

It's so obvious this game was never even tested before it went out the door. Not that it's not playable and can't be great... but just disappointing that it's just another game that isn't finished and they release it anyway. If they polish it up, fix a lot of bugs, put some actual thought and research into it... this will be a really good hunting game. But as it stands right now there's to many things killing the realism and fun.

Going to list out all the issues I've found. But my two biggest issues is the poor system where the animals can hear you way to easy and just run. Also, being forced to crawl on the ground like it's Metal Gear Solid in order to sneak if you're under 200 yards. All while the animals walk away twice as fast as you.
[list]
    [*]This game is NOT polished. So you will need a decent rig to run. Even with my 3090 I'm still struggling and there's a lot of ugly issues with foliage.
    [*]Of which, some of the foliage that doesn't render correctly looks like animals at a distance. Then when you zoom in it they vanish.
    [*]Leaves are bullet proof.
    [*]Bullet accuracy is off, 50 yard sited perfectly and I'll miss... but at 200 I can hit dead on? Might just be something to do with the scopes not being properly setup.
    [*]Animals can't really see you, but hear you breath from 300 yards and bolt.
    [*]The stealth was based on other shooters and the devs think you make less noise while crawling through dirt, sticks, and rocks than crouch walking.
    [*]They didn't get the head movement right  and if you try to crawl (which you have to in order to sneak) you'll get motion sickness. Even with it turned to 0.
    [*]The progression system isn't well thought out on what is needed to unlock things.
    [*]Animals patterns are way to based on location and time of day. I can just sleep till noon and go to any drinking point to find the animal I want.
    [*]When playing on PC (not sure on console) you have to have the quest active you want to use a kill towards. Then you have use the mouse to select sell/tax because if you hold the button you'll miss the pop-up telling you about it as it uses the same buttons to select it as well.

[b]Story and Ethical Hunting.[/b]

From the get go Way of the Hunter pushes the notion of ethical hunting and introduces the main character in a tidy cutscene detailing the reserve is currently experiencing a rampant sickness amongst the animals and that you are taking over for your grandfather, your job becomes twofold, to maintain and fulfil the orders for meat of both big and small game to local business to maintain an income and to also help combat the illness amongst the reserve species. 

But it does this in a way that isn't intrusive and isn't overly punishing for the player. The right tool for the right job is as paramount as it has always been, but the punishment for unethical hunting isn't so much a slap on the wrist and a large klaxon telling you that you are getting coal for Christmas so much as it is the game letting you learn from your mistake yourself by making the reward for the sold meat of that animal to be vastly reduced and let the player themselves realise that to make money from their hunts, they need to keep a lid on their overzealous hunting practices. 

Yes you CAN shoot a badger with a .338 Lapua, but selling meat of that animal would be a fairly hard thing to achieve now that you've turned most of that animal into a fine pink mist. 

The right gun, for the right animal isn't the only factor, with the game also trying to push the idea of good shot placement to vitals, but to also keep in mind the factor of genetics and age of the animal in question. This is where I feel the first of many elements that help let Way of the Hunter stand out amongst the already established comes into play.

Early on the game will teach the player that the animals all have a genetic makeup, and they can pass this along to future generations as the days and weeks in-game progress. With those genetics playing the biggest role once they hit maturity. You can cull an entire group of weak genetic deer, killing the old and mature ones to allow the younger ones to pass on better genes to the females of that group, whilst also being conscious that killing the females of that group is of very little worth to the player themselves.

Hunting that prey, and staying silent and watching these herds and groups migrate and grow is a large part of the charm. You aren't just there to kill and stick a head on a wall, but to also cultivate a strong reserve and combat illness and disease in those reserves.

[b]Graphics & Animation[/b]

Amongst the rolling vast hills, noisy and damp swamps or even across the vast mountainous ranges you get a sense of a truly lovingly built and hand crafted world for the animals to come to life in. Which when purely observed they do go about their routines with or without your influence. 

Reserve wildlife ranges from small Ducks and Geese, through to Badgers and Foxes and onwards to the biggest game like Bears and Moose. Each pose their own challenges to hunt, but also require specific knowledge and thought into the method of hunting them, finding the ideal time between them taking a drink or simply laying down will change the trajectory of your shot and could mean the difference between a clean double lung, or hitting the shoulder blades and losing the majority of shot energy pushing past the bone and not hitting vital organs for that quick and relatively painless kill.

[b]Gameplay[/b]

Collectively the Way of the Hunter brings forth elements of existing games of the genre and combines them with new ways to improve the experience and immerse the player into hunting mindset. Between beautiful landscapes and indepth animal mechanics like routines and detailed anatomy, to ballistics being modelled in such a way that it tracks muzzle velocity and calibre and translates these into dispersion of energy to the animal and cavity damage it can cause from expansion. There is always something to keep you on your toes whilst stalking and hunting and helping to control and improve the overall gene pool of herds and groups to avoid sickness and disease being rampant among the reserve population. 

Giving you a healthy set of options in regards firearms, ammo, callers and equipment means you have access to a vast array of choices to how you wish to go about your hunt. Including if you wish to catch animals early or late in the day or at specific parts of their routines and at specific known zones they tend to visit.

[b]Verdict[/b]

Setting aside the bugs and issues, at the heart of it Way of the Hunter delivers what it promises, a beautiful landscape, a vast abundance of animal types and sizes to hunt, storytelling with purpose and a clear and precise viewpoint to set across without forcing the player the abide by it without only harming themselves in the long run.

The developers are hot on the heels of most major and minor issues and were quick to address concerns from the players and potential future players regarding things like a missing FOV slider and lack of Ultrawide support. This also brings a point to bear about games being usually buggy and shipping with issues as games get vaster in terms of scope and size but also in terms of technicality. 

Way of the Hunter certainly sets itself some momentous goals to achieve and with it come issues from both lack of forethought but also general technical issues that are either overlooked or are hard to narrow down in a limited array of users until release to a larger base of players, and though it hasn't entirely reached those goals from the initial jump, it is absolutely well on its way to attaining the status is strives to achieve 

All in all The Way of the Hunter is stepping firmly into the genre and announcing itself to the world that it plans to hold its own against the existing forays into the hunting world, and I for one believe this to be an experience that anyone with an interest in hunting shouldn't pass up.",1660739633,1662292328,True,30,1,0.621705710887908936,0,True,False,False

With the drastically increased draw distance capable of rendering animals a bit further than 1200m away, you can EASILY get your marksmanship kicks here. By comparison, theHunter: CotW does 430m without mods. Beginners can easily enjoy marksmanship by toggling Hunter's Sense to see a red dot indicating the shot's final trajectory, and it even has a rangefinder function (!) so you can focus completely on this singular task (no need to pull out the binoculars).

It does follow theHunter: CotW's lead and sets up the maps pretty much the same way. This means you will need to travel to various locations to unlock new campsites and lodgings, which can be quite the gatekeeper especially in 4 player co-op until you've spread out your fast travel network quite a bit. The truck makes for an effective ""base camp"" as it can seat 2 (I can't believe they didn't go for 4) and has a storage trunk where you can customize your load out and refill ammo indefinitely. It is not possible to fast travel to the truck, so be careful where you leave it since you can only keep 1 spawned in the world at a time.

I admit I've gotten used to the doge in theHunter, but I found tracking in WotH to be very intuitive as the disturbed environment and blood spatter show enough details upon inspection. It's also very important to press or hold X to mark the relative spot after shooting to make tracking the body easier. The tracking comes in timed pulses and is stopped when moving too fast, so it can get tricky to get used to it. If you enjoy tracking and stalking, the information from Hunter Sense paired with the extreme draw distance works incredibly well.

On the flip side, ambush hunting is just straight-up broken for solo players. By abusing nearby campsites to sleep, you can quickly minimize the time needed for the herd to come back to a particular needs zone. While it quickly breaks the game with the speedy earnings, it does also mean that those who don't enjoy the whole stalking process can literally sit down and have a great time.

Speaking of speedy earnings... Hunting equipment. There isn't a lot here, and there is just a deep crevasse where bows and crossbows ought to be (it was already confirmed to not be available at launch). Wanna get dripped out? Sorry, you'll look exactly the same as everyone else. This severe lack in variety does mean that everyone will dress and progress the same way because there isn't any alternatives available. But the equipment does sound and feel great to use. But seriously, there isn't anything to look at here (e.g. only birdshot for all shotguns).

While the current content is sparse, this smaller team of developers have proven the game's foundation to be quite excellent and worth investing into as the modern hunting game. theHunter: CotW has obviously more content and is much more complete, but it's easy to see which game will be better with a few more major updates, QoL (e.g. there is auto-run but not for vehicles), and mod support.",1661117415,1662227911,True,14,3,0.59487682580947876,0,True,False,False

Being from the UK I have no experience with real world hunting, but that's not the point. This game is supposed to be an EXPERIENCE and NOT a simulator, and the experience is something it does very well.

The main story is compelling, and the animal AI far exceed similar games of its type. I'd like to see a larger selection of weapons and additional types, as well as different ammunition types as well. At the moment you're limited to simply restocking by visiting the Storage/Safe at the lodge. I've also noted that all weapons seem to sound the same, and whilst I'm sure their real world counterparts do sound similar, I have a feeling there will be differences but I can't seem to tell apart.

I've only played on one map so far, but it is enormous and extremely well detailed. I feel like some regions could do with ""stocking up"" on animals as sometimes you can walk for many kilometres and not hear or see a single animal including birds. I'm sure the real forests of America have a much higher bird population.

One negative this I will say is the sound engine is .. well .. ridiculous. Sometimes sounds simply cut off, sometimes they just don't work .. and sometimes they get so loud you can't hear anything else. Now I'm sure waterfalls and such have that effect, but not streams and rivers. This needs some significant improvements!

Overall I would recommend this game if you're wanting to have a hunting experience. It places you in a lush and vibrant alpine environment which is beautifully modelled and at times really does feel alive.",1662224564,1662224564,True,4,0,0.497060924768447876,0,True,False,False

As for now.. not recommended. wait for a fix..

Edit:

I see a lot of potential in WOTH. It is beautiful and the animal behavior is pretty realistic. 

The problem for me is it feels like it have been rushed a bit. I have hade a lot of bugs and glitches in the few hours I have  played. Getting stuck when crouching by trees and animals actually de-spawning on retrieval. 

Many of the textures look like they were ported from PS2 and the character animations, well.. I have had a few good laughs from crawling and watching my huntingbuddys character in awkward position ü§£ü§£

I hope developers will invest in fixing issues and upgrading textures. Also, the menu/options need a complete overhaul.

I will always love COTW, and I am still looking for that true next-gen hunting-sim.

In my 9hrs, here are just a few of the issues i've experienced.  I can't list them all, but here's a quick 10 just off the top of my head.
1.)  Game runs okay, but its very demanding. (Low/mid range PC players beware)
2.)  Shadow, tree, and foliage flickering.
3.)  I can drive my jeep withing 50m of a deer and it wont move, but walking at the same distance will spook it.
4.)  Dozens and i mean dozens of crashes with the ""fatal error message""
5.)  Have gotten stuck in reload animations numerous times, cant shoot, can't aim, only fix is fast traveling to a location.
6.) Water is your enemy, all animals will sink like a rock to the bottom, in shallow water it makes them very difficult to find, and in deep water they are unable to be claimed entirely.
7.)  When trying to hunt birds, they often just do circles in the air around you instead of fleeing.
8.)  Losing kills due to the bodies clipping into the ground and disappearing.
9.)  Animal herds clipping into each other.  (Hypothetically, let's say there's a buck you want to shoot, well TOO BAD.  There's 3 doe that are clipping through it's body while grazing, you'll hit one of them instead)
10.)  The vehicles almost seem to attract animals.  If you ever have a hard time finding animals, just drive down the road and they will come flocking, almost as if they're trying to kill themselves on the hood of your jeep.

I also lost a Big Horn Sheep that after being shot ran into a small lake and then sank to the bottom where I was unable to claim it. I hope the colour of the tracking could be changed as it mixes with the grass.

I definitely recommend to hunting game fans but perhaps waiting to buy would be prudent. It feels like it should have been an early access launch.

However...I've been hooked on it in the first two weeks until the first PC patch broke a few things, I've taken some time off to wait for a new patch now the dev branch has been released and am missing my time in game - so I'd say that's a good sign. 

Possibly the best bit of the game for me has been the herd management. It's a fun, interesting and very rewarding mechanic which stops you shooting every buck in sight and can be very satisfying to watch a young one star buck grow into a much higher star mature with a large rack over the course of in game time.

The maps can be gorgeous with really interesting terrain to explore, although the lighting and weather conditions could be better and there is a blurriness to everything that can be a little off putting. Hunter vision could do with some tweaks for those who use it but I love that it's an optional thing to turn on and off as you wish, and adds to the realism feel being able to go without it. The current rifles and shotguns are satisfying to fire although there could be some improvement to recoil there. The sound design is fairly poor across the board from weapons to ambient audio and I'd love to see an overhaul of that area of the game specifically. The in-game economy needs some tweaks I think as well, it really didn't take me long to purchase everything available in the guns, gear and attachments category which is nice because now I have loads of money to taxidermy things but until new things are released, there's not really anything for me to spend my money on or work toward beyond fives star taxidermy.

It's a slow and methodical game (slower than it's competitor and I don't think that's a bad thing). If you don't have patience, this is certainly not the game for you. If you're into hunting games or fancy a really relaxing experience and have a high tolerance for bugs then I think it's worth your time. 

If you are happy to wait a bit to see what the devs do then I think that'd be the best move - if they can support this game and update it to their vision then I think it'll be a fantastic and well loved hunting sim. So far they've been really responsive on the Discord and already addressed some of the most  requested features that were missing at launch. It's a shame the first patch introduced a whole load of new bugs but they've already quickly moved to create a dev branch and get new patches live on there to be tested by the willing community.

Second one never found, blood trail ended (Was a lung shot again.) Third deer I shot three times from 500+ M One was a clear lung shot, one was a clear head shot and the last one I just saw the blood splatter. No find 0 trail. Gone. When I first found out there was no true full screen (The mouse does not leave the screen) and that the mouse will in fact leave the screen and not let you ADS or shoot after you ADS. You have to do a dance just to get shooting to work. (IE keep the mouse courser somewhat in the middle of the screen) I tried to get that to work out but managed to miss a good amount of shots by not firing at all OR not getting to shoot because it wouldn't let me ADS or stuck in the Binoculars. No FOV slider as well? Who does that to a game. I will wait for a few updates before I request a refund. If they don't fix this game I will get my money back.

UPDATE: So after some time of playing the game. I fixed the mouse problem (Change the rez and change it back) I had no idea what I was getting into. I dealt with the lack of an FOV slider but I still pressed on. I am under the assumption that the single player is on a simulated multiplayer server. I will have a moose looking me right in my eyes mear feet away. I will pull the trigger with the red dot from the hunter view covering its whole head proper range and all that and the bullet will go straight through its head and it will reset to its original standing pose and run right off. If you shoot from VERY far away you will almost always hit your target tho. I have a few 1km shots now and they are all very accurate. So the call for distance model is different then the close one sure. But if I shoot something in the head and it pops back into a forward looking position instantly that kinda... Breaks everything that I know about shooting something in the head. 

The game is cool overall tho. After fighting with it I got it to work. The no FOV hurts my soul but they say they are going to be fixing that. Shots are strange up close so find the good distance that the close model isn't fully animated so that you don't have to deal with the head screen VS server somewhere else. GREAT looking game. Massive props. Feels great almost everywhere you are.

I am on the fence if its a good or bad game. I'm still going to say don't but I am honestly enjoying myself with the game.

Random side note. This game has RPG aspects so if you don't like something at the moment you just might level into the fix. Why? No idea. Thats an odd aspect to a hunting game... Tracking needs work but it gets better as you ""level"" up. Hard to see in the daytime. Glows like a rave at night. Gets better as you ""Level"" your skills too... INSPECT EVERYTHING I guess its XP....

Love the aspect of preparing yourself for the hunt (killing something with a wrong caliber takes away the value - you one shot a duck with laupa round and its basically worthless)

Environment is gorgeous. They need to add swimming tho cause jumping into a bit to deep river (about chest high) kills you instantly. But there is still time for that.

Many people complain about weapons. Its not Arma2 or Arma3. Its a hunting game that just came out. I dont think devs will ever add something moronic like an m4 or 50 cal but people keep complaining.
I would love to see more lever action rifles tho.

Complaints like ""oh the animals run away duuuh"" are from morons that sprint in the middle of the forest and cant find shit cause everything runs away when you make noise. Its not battlefiled and it never will be.

Give it some time and learn a bit about the game, then  decide again what you think. This game in my opinion is a real gem in the hunting genre. The world is beautiful with different biome like places. Lowland grassy areas to high mountain areas. The animals react to your noise, smell and if they can see you as they do in real life so take your time, be stealthy and slow down and you will have a better time in this game. The game also have a decent story which i enjoyed playing trough and it will also get you different places on the map, unlock spots you need and let you see most of the animals that are currently in the game.

    Game is absolutely amazing if it was a beta test. But selling this as a finished product is a joke. They come out with patched that break the game further. While not unplayable once you get the the point where you're truly ready to free roam and start your experience you'll find more and more bugs. A lot of the game bugs have been since those who had early access and somehow made it to the final game. You can submit tickets but its useless and they will only fix what they see fit. Issues you'll run into include the following
1) animals you have killed will fall into the world so you can not harvest them
2) Herds will not show at drinking spots until you re-log
3) When entering a hunting stand you will fly indefinitely in a random direction
4) Items purchased will no longer be available and you will have to re-buy them. 
5) Animals who's blood trail show it will only make it roughly 100 yards will need to be tracked over 500 yards
6) Blood trail will not show until you open and close menu
While there bugs might not seem too big you can expect at least half of them every time you log in. I was trying to wait and give the devs time to fix these but after being a part of there discord it seems the devs only pay attention if you badmouth them and will often times ignore the complaints being put out by the community.

The first extremely important thing to understand, is that this game is a SIMULATOR and not an ARCADE! This means, that it¬¥s a way more slow phase hunt - You can easily go 45-60min. without even finding an animal.

PROS: 

- Stunning graphics
- Extremely immersive
- Beautiful music and sounds in general
- Very true to life gameplay
- Fun missions
- Easy to understand and play, but extremely hard to master.
- Good balance on ingame priceing vs. monitary rewards
- An acceptable selection of items for a new; just released game
- The DEVS. seem to really have a clear idea on where they want the game to go (i.e. actively showing Community awareness)
- Good idea with the perk system
- HUGE and very diverse maps
- Really good idea with the need zone system (You¬¥ll never know exactly where your herds are)

CONS:

As it stands now, and not taking coming changes into consideration

- Few but very detrimantal bugs (But hey, it¬¥ve JUST been released!)
- Quite unrealistic zeroing (1km. zeroing is rediculous to me)
- Lacking customization in the perk (you¬¥re gonna get EVERY single perk at some point no matter what).
- Extremely difficult to spot and track blood trails (If you take your eyes off the blood trail even for 1 sec. it¬¥s almost impossible to find it again)
- Lacking diversity in ammo

VERDICT: 7,5/10 - When the announced changes have been implemented, it¬¥s gonna be a easy 8.5/10",1661340663,1661951161,True,1,0,0.508733630180358887,0,True,False,False

I really wasn't drawn back into the game though, so I think until some other things are added like maybe fishing, and maybe a survival aspect I will probably leave this game on the shelf. 
Didn't experience any issues as far as in game, no bugs I found. I think the most annoying thing was how the animals could get so spooked easily, I know that sounds a little silly to say about a hunting game but hear me out. I'm sure there is a trigger zone for what makes them move, but I feel if I was driving in my loud as heck Jeep it shouldn't allow me to get basically within 100m and then they spook when I got out the car , not from the vehicle. Basically once you get in that trigger zone its over which I'm not sure how I feel about. Think they should be alerted well before that because I got so close to them while driving, then it was once I got out of my car they were like HUMAN! RUN!

I'd really like to see a survival aspect added to this game, I think a lot of people would agree, as you wanna make the long hunts feel long. Not just I stalked it, and BAM now I head home. Plus it gives you that off the grid feeling, and being able to leave the car behind.  I think that's something to take note from Open Country. Long hunts were possible because you could pitch tents, make food, actually get hurt. Right now you get hurt but there isn't really anything that says it effects you minus it being like COD, you were low health, couple seconds pass, a big breath later and you're ready to roll again. 

Shooting in the game feels good, I don't love how the zeroing works, because it's oddly specific to 106.8 yards, I've never zeroed rifles like that. Always to 50-100 yards. The round you shoot at the target matters same goes for shot location. It gives you a nice in-depth view of your kill shot. I believe it scores it in some manner, don't think it's needed. This isn't ready or not. 

I tihink overall it's a good game, it's def not like COTW, I don't think this game should compete with it. I think it's worth a pick up when on sale. The Season Pass and Hunters pack, I don't think are worth it as of right now. AGAIN game on sale, I'd pick it up. I'd like to see a little more of a timeline as well to see what we get next and how it impacts the game. 

Side note: Hunting games have to be the hardest games to support solely because of how little they come out, and when they do at least recently you get a huge bust like Open Country.
Right now I think they have an idea of what they want to do, but as of patch 1.16 a lot of it has been fixing bugs and hot fixes that have caused more issues. No issues on my end while playing, so I keep a hopeful mind that if they add certain things, we're going to see what everyone thought Open Country could have been, just in a much better way.

COTW on the other hand, we all know what happens there. Game Breaking bug, 6 months later a fix that brings 3 new big bugs with it. They've already addressed a major issue for PS5 which is nice to see, as they're at least paying attention to users. 

Key positives: 
[list]
[*]Bullet ballistics. They seem pretty good with bullet drop and shooting a running animal
[*]Shot placement is really all that matters. If you gut shot something, you've ruined it
[*]Animal herd management seems amazing
[*]There are lots of things here written in many reviews
[/list]

Now for why I chose no
[list]
[*]Audio problems: I didn't hear this for the first few days but sometimes the rivers sound like you're on a runway standing behind an overloaded 747 dreamlifter at 110% throttle trying to take off. Animal calls also do this occasionally. 

[*]Guns, Ammo, Gear: there are none üòí They touted having licensed everything, even ammo but you can't even select ammo. There are only a handful of rifles/shotguns. I really, really don't care if it says it's a Remington 783 or if it's a Billy Joe Bob 1242, I'm sure some people will really like that and I suppose if they add a specific gun that you own/use that's pretty cool. I don't hate it, I just want a selection.

[*]Levleing up callers? No Thanks! This is just dumb. The predator caller for example only works on rabbits until you level up your calling skill. It's just stupid and I hate it. You can level up all the callers by using any caller so I just shot a bunch of Does (there should be a different plural for Doe, that's dumb too üòÑ) and I'm at level 2 now anyway.

[*]Character Skills: Most of these are great but there are some I'd want to disable and can't. The biggest of them being the skills you get for walking around crouched. After you have crouched around for 15km you walk 15% faster but also produce 10% more noise. I don't want to walk faster, i want to stay quiet and as far as I can tell you can't turn this off. 

[*]Hunter Sense: Not being able to identify things unless hunter sense on or gauge distance is kinda sucky too. I've just gotten used to having it on all the time and it's super grainy and dark all the time now because that's how they want me to play?

[*]Then there is the gun energy factor. This is cool and something that I hope gets tweaked. 
If you shoot an elk with a 338, a class 6 gun on a class 6 animal but you're too close it will explode like a grenade and ruin all your meet. I shot an elk, direct heart shot. i didn't hit anything else from about 70 yards. I lost over 300lbs of meat......... Uhhhh what? No

[*]Now for the one everyone will hate: 
It has difficulty options which is amazing. Sometimes I just want to screw around and not spend literal hours trying to follow a herd of sheep.

I think the animals are a too skittish on the easiest difficulty(explorer). I've spent most of my time on the normal (adventurer) mode but later at night or when I'm just burnt out and want to relax for a moment I'll switch to explorer and things can still hear me breath from 4 miles away it seems. Yes, yes, you just said ""Git Gud Bro"" because you're obviously the #1 hunter IRL and in game in all of the galaxy and I'm the worst player to ever play a game, ever. I just think easy mode should be easy. I was super excited to see difficulty options so then you insane players that actually want to spend 6 hours tracking a 3 star elk only to have it run away and you say ""It's fine, I'll get it next time"" have something to do and I can still have fun playing a game üòÑ

[*]Bugs: This will probably get fixed sooner than 6 months like some ""other"" games. The audio is a problem but not a game breaker. Blood Trailer however.... They just vanish and because the animals don't actually leave tracks of any kind which is just weird you will likely never find that animal. Did it fall through the map? Did Bigfoot eat it? Did Nosferatu take it to suck it's blood? Just like asking How many licks it takes to get to the center of a tootsie pop, the world may never know
	[/list]

They did address some things in their latest update, however I am now seeing crashes often. Sometimes this is while shooting, sometimes while walking. It's frustrating to shoot at an animal and then get a ""fatal error"" so I've stopped playing until the next update. Hopefully they'll figure whatever this is out and I can test out the changes they made and change this review

Still needs alot of improvements and patching for sure.
Runs fine on a good old Geforce 1080/Ryzen 3700X on ultra settings @1080p- gpu at 100% cpu is bored though ~60 fps ;)

Has a nice story and missions, super immersive graphics and atmosphere and way different game mechanics compared to good old COTW that take some time to get used to as this isn't just COTW with better graphics, it's waaaay harder to find, stalk and finaly shoot and find shot animals even on standard difficulty 2/4.

You will have to sneak like hell and place that one shot like super correctly, otherwise you will spend like for ever to track them down. A 2nd shot is like almost impossible to get off correctly and you will regret it even trying to... go for the heart. Always!

Finally a hunting game, that looks and feels like you are really going out for a hunt.
It is more challenging than other games in the same genre, but the satisfaction and joy this game brings with every spotted or killed animal is just awesome..

Everything in this game just feels right. From scouting through a fascinating landscape, watching animals and their behaviour, to wait for the right moment and finally take the shot.. 

The game also offers a lot of activities. You can just go on a hunt or get into the quests, jobs or challenges. My favorite thing in the game is the herd management. I love the fact, that a game supports an ethical hunt and also rewards it with a better potential of animals and trophies!",1661843544,1661843699,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

At this early stage after release, it doesn't quite live up to its ambitions, but the things it does right it does so very right that I have found myself no longer playing COTW.   

If you are after a [b]hiking simulator[/b] with astonishing immersive audiovisuals and a huge, detailed and varied environment to get around* and marvel at, with beautifully rendered and animated animals to occasionally sneak up on and take a pot shot at, then WOTH is absolutely for you. 9 Rock Games have pushed Unreal Engine to jaw dropping levels, with huge rendering distances, incredible lighting and weather, detailed models and textures, beautiful realistic vegetation and clutter, and none of that telltale UE ""sheen"" that plagues many UE games. They've also mastered the art of making 500m feel like 5km, so the world feels truly enormous. The game world is an obvious labour of love and quite simply one of the greatest open world environments out there. 

If you're after a sweet and decent [b]Firewatch style story[/b] on ethical hunting (not an oxymoron), to help bring some overarching purpose to the enviroment they've created, then WOTH also fits the bill.  

However, if you're after a deep and bug free [b]hunting simulator[/b] with all its intricate interlocking systems working perfectly, something that took COTW devs Expansive Worlds several years to eventually get (almost) right, then you might want to keep your wallet in your pocket for now. There are deep and infuriating flaws and bugs with essential hunting game mechanics including vanishing blood trails, vanishing animals, insane spooking sensitivity even on low difficulty, implausible damage responses (esp boar), vanishing equipment, no rustling when player brushes vegetation, stuttering and performance issues, occasional crashes etc etc. 

The game has only been out for a few weeks and the devs are aware of its issues to say the least, and apparently responsive to addressing them. If they can get WOTH to properly realise its own version of the casualised hunting sim, then I think the game is destined for true greatness. If you want to come along for the ride right now then you're going to pay $50 to be a beta tester for the next few months (or more) unfortunately, but that seems to be the trend with games nowadays.

This game is so in-depth and detailed that it can ALMOST be comparable to hunting in real life. HOWEVER... being a newly-released game does have it flaws. I'll go over the current pros and cons of this game. I'll also be comparing this game to both theHunter titles (Classic and Call of the Wild) a little bit, as those are the other two most popular hunting games on Steam.

PROS
______

- A very realistic environment. Aesthetically beautiful.
- *Mostly* realistic animal models, with beautiful antler/horn designs for the deer, sheep, and goat species.
- Realistic firearms (love how they're gaining sponsorships from actual firearm brands).
- Realistic animal reactions to gunshots.
- The genetics system is a cool, and actually realistic way to establish better herds with larger males.
- A lot of content for a base release. Trophy lodges come with the game, and aren't DLC.
- Buying the Elite edition is actually worth it especially for the long run, as you'll receive two of the upcoming DLC maps for free.

CONS
______

- The bird models, especially that of the mallard/wild duck, don't look all that great. I believe they need to be redone.
- Waterfowl hunting is lacking decoys and duck blinds. However, I'm certain that's a planned future feature.
- Sleeping in-game can be abused, much like in theHunter: Call of the Wild. There should be a 12 hour sleeping time cap, with maybe a sleep cooldown of 6 in-game hours.
- Like Call of the Wild, hunting in the game is too lenient on need zones. You can abuse the ""often"" need zones to find animals guaranteed.
- Herbivorous animals are ALWAYS in herds. I'd like to see more animals wandering on their lonesome, much like theHunter Classic's animals.
- With the game's genetics system, it can be too easy to gain a max scoring trophy once you figure out how the entire genetics/fitness system works. That's why I think they need to diversify antlers and horns furthermore, as well as other trophy-defining features.
- Some animals are either too skittish or not skittish enough. For example, you can't put a proper spot and stalk on elk, bighorn sheep, and mountain goat because they spook too easily. Also for example, red fox aren't skittish enough. You can run up to them around 50 yards and they won't spook.
- Lots of gameplay bugs.
- Some of the difficulties are swapped around. For example, animals spook less on Hunter mode than Adventurer mode, when animals are also too skittish on Adventurer.
- Multiplayer, while playable, is super broken. Definitely needs lots of work.

Overall, Way of the Hunter is an immersive and quite realistic experience. However, some things definitely need tweaked and a lot of bugs need to be patched. For now, I'll give this game an 8.5/10.

The short version is that I'm an avid outdoorsman and hunter in real life. I used to play alot of Call of the Wild for my hunting simulation gameplay. When I saw Way of the Hunter, I'd thought I give it a try and see what it's got. I'm glad I did. Here's some key points:

-No levelling or RPG heavy grinding to unlock things.
-It doesn't take forever to get the equipment you need. Everything is unlocked quickly, basically from the start as you get through the beginning tutorial missions, you just need the in-game fictional money (no micro-transactions or paying real money other than what you paid to buy the game in the first place) earned from successful hunts to get it, which doesn't take as long as you might think.
-The focus is on the hunting experience, not the grinding for equipment or leveling up to improve your character's skills or unlock equipment.
-Amimal behavior is realistic and makes sense. Animations are on point.
-Animals move at the appropriate speed, meaning it's just as hard to hit a moving target in the game as it would in real life.
-Animals's senses are realistic, depending on the difficulty level you choose. Wind and the use of terrain will be very important.
-The information the game gives you and the amount of ""hand-holding"" is basically totally customizable in the game's options.

There'd be alot to go into aside from those. I've decided to make this game my go-to hunting simulation game. Call of the Wild is cool, and has more hunting reserves for the time being, but Call of the Wild focuses on RPG game mechanics - things like levelling and grinding and playing for hours on end to get better trophy animals. I hated that aspect. It actually ruined the experience for me.

Way of the Hunter is a totally different game. It focuses on the hunting experience, itself. The in-game money is earned from successful hunts, the idea being that the player is a career hunter for restaurants and such. There isn't this long, drawn out process to just hunt in the game. The animals are realistic, their behaviors are on point, their animations are well done, and their senses are realistic and logical. Wind matters more. The choice of weapon matters more. How you move, the speed you move, your use of the terrain all matters.

I'll be blunt - this is the definitive realistic hunting simulation. It blows Call of the Wild out of the park, because it's more realistic and the focus is on the hunting experience, itself.

To have the blood trail of animals disappear, or the body of dead animals just despawn in-front of you before you can claim them is so disheartening and it makes me not want to shoot any of the bigger trophy animals for fear they also disappear. another huge problem is the hit boxes on small bushes, unless you're shooting a deer in an open field or in an incredibly clear LOS, you wont even hit them, the little leaves from the smallest bush will stop your bullet and the animals will flee. Another gripe is the trees will grab you and lock you in place while crouch walking through the forest, and you need to stand, jump, or go prone to get away from them, if you even can. multiple times I've had to fast travel to the lodge to get out of being stuck, which is a huge pain after some of the crazy distance you can walk without a camp or lodge near by.

I'll say that the game is not bad.  I've beaten the (somewhat cheesy) story and have used every gun in the game.

I'm not going to list any of the positives in this review because I feel as of no, the negatives outweigh them tenfold.

1. Gun power/""energy"" and vital shots.
      As someone who has shot a gun chambered in every round in the game, I feel like they don't understand what the scaling should be.  Starting off with the 7mm-08, this round should be able to drop everything in the game. I own a rifle that use for hunting chambered in 7mm-08 and I have never hit a deer right behind the shoulder and not dropped it within at least 15 yards.  I can understand you have to make the guns distinct and stand out, but this just doesn't feel right. 

      The vital shots are more of the issue at play here, I think.  In any ""real"" world scenario, if you double lung a mountain goat with a .308, it will not be running over 400 meters away.  It reduces the value of actually taking your time to shoot.  I personally now just wait for the animal to look at me and spine shot them (at least they got that right.)  

2. Hunter Sense
      This may be the biggest issue currently in the game.  WHO DECIDED TO MAKE THE COLOR OF HUNTER SENSE GOLD?  It is literally the same color as the grass when the sun is hitting it so good luck tracking anything in the day time.  Also, having to unlock the ability to use it while walking is just benign (we'll touch on this more later). I could maybe see having to unlock it while running but this is just dumb.

3. The Unlock System.
      I understand that these games have to some ""skill"" or ""character tree"" that people can upgrade but it's just done wrong here.  The ""movement"" skills are just obtained by moving. So, for keyboard players, just face yourself a direction, hit ""F"", and go eat lunch.  The ""gun"" skills are basically useless until you shoot 75 animals in the ""vitals"". They should basically be reversed.

4. The Animal Calls
      Everything with the Animal Calls is done so wrong, that it's hard to exaggerate it.  I have to ""unlock my call"" to attract certain tiers of animals?  Why would it not just call in the herd and let that play out randomly? The skills for the calls are practically how the calls should be to begin with but they make you work harder for it.  Plus, half the time, they don't seem to have any affect on the animals around you. I don't know if that is a bug or an intended mechanic but it exists.

5. The Car
      I am glad this thing exists. 
      Wanna jump off the highest peak in the game and survive? Take the peeJ.
      Wanna complete most missions in half the time by just running them over? Take the peeJ.
      Wanna block deer so you can get out and shoot them in the back of the head once they turn around?
      You guessed it.
      Take the peeJ.
      This thing will save you so much time until you can unlock the best guns and then actually play the game.
      I put this as a negative because you shouldn't be able to just complete the game in a quarter of the time by hitting the animals but you can.
      I shouldn't feel pressured into using the car to complete missions in the game because I shot the last 3 mule deer at 100 yards and then lost them in tracking.
     Overall, it's just sad but I found it the only way to actually beat some of the missions without losing my mind tracking animals.

7. Shotguns
      This isn't as much of a gripe as some of the others, but the spread on the shotguns sometimes seems radically inconsistent.  I can be shooting at a duck at 50 m and miss when I am right on them and then I can shoot at 80 m a little to the side and drop them.  I feel like maybe it just kinda shoots out a randomized curtain and if it hits the bird, congrats.

I know this may seem like a bunch of small things, but altogether they make the game so infuriating and time consuming.  I hope they tweak a lot of the gun energy and vital shot specs but we'll have to wait and see.  As of now, I think I'm gonna go back to some other games and wait for some patch notes.",1661721149,1661721149,False,11,0,0.621024012565612793,0,True,False,False

You can't help compare it to theHunter: Call of the Wild (which I love) but Way of the Hunter focuses more on realism. It's a much more methodical and slow-paced hunting game and I am all for it. Learning the animal behaviors and ultimately getting the kill after 25 mins of tracking and sneaking is just so rewarding. As a result I remember almost every animal I have in my trophy lodge. 
It's a gorgeous game with huge maps, fantastic weather effects, great animal behavior and animations, realistic bullet ballistics and an intriguing and novel herd management system in which you get to choose which animals to cull and which ones to let grow and mature. Honestly CotW is an arcade shooting gallery compared to WotH.

Graphics are good, and that's about all that is. 

The game runs horribly, shooting is terrible, the animal AI is beyond janky and is nearing horrible, shooting is terrible with massive trigger delay and a limited range of weapons - specifically calibres of rifles, even with the DLC's. The sound is awful and you cant really hear anything, especially if you're next to a gentle creek that sounds like a raging torrent. Wind doesn't change in direction at all, it only grows in intensity, and even then, doesn't affect the ballistics. The trigger delay when firing means that it is impossible to hit a shot on a moving target with any reasonable level of accuracy. Don't worry though, you'll only encounter these issues between the regular crashes from a ""Critical  error"".

If you are looking for a hunting simulator that *MAKES* you take your time, is *NOT* an arcade shooter, that *DEMANDS* patience - get this. The obvious comparison is Hunter Classic with next gen graphics, two maps for now, and enough equipment to get you on your way.

Graphically it's gorgeous (Unreal 4), with maps that are large but don't feel empty or copy/pasted, the animals herd realistically, and the choice of *licensed* equipment means you've the tools you need, not 5 variations of the same thing. Tracking is *tough* but realistic, animals act and react realistically, and the missions are a *lot* better than a handful of 'go here' unlocks. And yeah, no 'tower missions' either.

Yes, it has some polish it needs (name a new release that doesn't) but the devs are active in their discord and promising patches to fix a lot of the initial niggles. As for how active the devs are for this game, a PlayStation bug was patched out with a day, PC got a patch in a few days of launch, and within a week of launch they had instituted a dev branch test server. If there's teething problems, they're committed to patching promptly.

- Do not walk next to any rock or tree, you are flipping a coin on getting stuck.
- There is ZERO feedback from the game as far as how stealthy you are.  No indication at all for whether walking through water or a bush is as silent as it sounds.  Nor is there anything to tell you if you are visually hidden at all.  If this were a game with perfected audio and if you knew visual stealth worked as you see it, maybe this could work, but the game isn't that.  I crouch walked on the other side of a hill near a loud river with wind cover, yet the animals got spooked anyway at around 100 yards.  My read is that this is a formula without any in depth mechanics behind it.  Crouch walk within 100 yards equals spooked, regardless of the environmental conditions.
- I bought the upgraded binoculars.  Several hours of gameplay later I do a 4 mile trek to unlock a cabin.  Log out (due to getting stuck) and back in to find I no longer have binoculars at all.  Game forgot I bought it somehow and then unequipped it. I ran to the cabin, unlocked the location (or so I thought) and teleported back to base to figure out what happened to the binoculars, only to find that I can't fast travel back to the other location for vOv reasons.  This is probably due to stupid mechanics that exist in a lot of games where it is not enough to see a location (for example a hunting stand) you have to walk up to it and find the spot that makes the game recognize you are there in order for it to count it.
- Buying passes for areas in the store is like playing roulette.  As far as I can tell, the names in the store do not match the names on the map.  Pretty simple thing to get wrong.
-  Whenever I shoot wolves with what I am told are the correct guns, I lose 90% of value in loss to the shot. IDK what I'm supposed to do.
- Calls are pretty useless.  For the range that they work you might as well save yourself the time and shoot the target that you will likely be tracking for 50-100 yards anyway.
- There is no incentive to hunt smaller game.  The value of animals basically tells players that they should just go hard on moose until there's no economic pressures anymore.
- Very few items, with very little information as to what makes them distinct (weapons of same tier) either.
- Hard to interact with tracks.  I have been tracking an animal I shot a minute prior and literally saw the tracks disappear as I looked at them.  They also randomly drop off for hundreds of yards and that conflicts with the bleedout information you are given at the start of the trail.
- Range information for guns basically removes the challenge of long distance shooting and turns it into a formula.
- When you switch from one map to the other, your location is saved and reloaded, but your gear is changed.  Instead of having your red dear call, you have the moose call you put on for the other map.  Might as well not save the location then and restart at the nearest cabin.

This game is fun in Singleplayer as far a the starting area goes. But bugs and problems peeks their ugly head right at the moment, when you get to hunt larger prey. 
To summarize the experince for me:
‚Ä¢ You will see the word ""Spooked"" more than you like, I guarantee you this. And for me... I just told me I'm not good enough right now and kept pushing. 
‚Ä¢ about 16 hours and items I purchased started disapearing in my inventory, 
‚Ä¢ prey teleported from 300 meters to 150 meters near me, without me moving and got spooked just to run to the same place I was watching them with my binoculars. The whole thing repeated itself 3 times and even after restart this kept happening. 
‚Ä¢ Get told you need to watch the balance of female and male animals in a herd, but giving you a penny and a half for everything that's not the alpha animal in the herd
‚Ä¢ the animal develop a type of third eye/sixth sense the further away you go from the starting area to the point animals hiding between the densest trees and 3 hills between you and them suddenly ""sensing"" you because you are in the magical 300 meter radar zone of some of them.
‚Ä¢ Also: Elks seem to have orbital surveillance on you from their private satelite at all time. Or maybe I'm that bad, who knows...

[u]Multiplayer[/u]
It's basically the game got stripped of it's convenience and only means of making currency, but you can suffer through it, with more than yourself! Other features include:

‚Ä¢ Watch you game lag hard when you sit on the passenger seat, like it's some buggy indie co-op mod of an AAA game made by one person in unity. 
‚Ä¢ Respawn your vehicle 15 times because the game thinks it's not yours. 
‚Ä¢ Or maybe go start the server every now and then because you want to hunt to a specific time, because the multiplayer doens't let you rest.
‚Ä¢ Sneaking to the perfect spot for the shot? Don't forget to use some form of communication like discord or steam chat to let the others know, NOBODY should move or your prey gets spooked by a person 2,5 kilometers away from your current location. 
‚Ä¢ Watch your lungshot get overwritten by another hunter shooting at the same deer but slightly after your shot.

I'm not really getting into this game. It is more realistic than COTW but the atmosphere and graphics style in COTW just feels better for some reason. The only thing this game has on COTW (graphically speaking) is the animations, blood trails and render distance of animals and vegetation. The walk speeds are kind of annoying; I feel like the normal 'walk' speed seems more like a slow jog or trot, and the 'sneak' speed is way too slow when you just really want to slow down and try to enjoy the atmosphere. It would've been really neat to see an Escape from Tarkov inspired movement speed system where you could select several different movement speeds on the fly with the mouse wheel. I get COTW has had a few years to work out the kinks and come up with new content, but this game just feels like an early access game in terms of the bugs at launch and (in my opinion) doesn't really offer just a whole lot more other than a better render distance and more realistic animal and ballistics behavior when compared to COTW.

Would an addict tell you to get bad heroin? Yes, yes they would, because they're addicted. That's what I am. Addicted to this game. BUT, it's so, so very bad in it's current state. 
Multi-player isn't co-op. Your campsites and fast travel locations are not shared. You cannot unlock points in another's game. 
Performance is absolute dog sheet. Even the devs are telling people to use low foliage settings
Weapons and callers have disappeared from inventory. Restarts sometimes help this.
Animals disappear when trying to collect. Happened about 3 times in 3 hours. Total loss of 1,500 credits.
Sounds are so loud. Standing near water will overpower discord conversations. Driving sounds are tied to master volume, not sound effects. SO SO LOUD
But like I said. It's addicting. I've played theHunter Classic, theHunter CotW, and loved them. This game has so much potential. If it were any more expensive, I would have been alot more upset about the state the game was released in. Part of the reason I got this game was the way it looked. It look like pooh. No different than theHunter Classic, but with worse AA.
The best thing about this game by far, is the herd mentality and shot reactions. Better by far, than either of the previous iterations of this game. 
Weapon and Gear selection are low at this time. No bows or crossbows. But hey, at least you no longer pay for ammo. Which means that shotguns are fowl only. No slugs, no buckshot. 
Callers require you to call and kill 10 females before you unlock lvl 2 Callers. 20 males later, you can advance to lvl 3 Caller. 
There is a genetic system. Meaning kill more females, your park will be males only, Cull the 1 and 2 star mature males for better generational genetics. Kill the weak, breed the strong.

(Edit: After trying out Call of the wild, I'm upgrading this review to thumbs up (4.5 stars). This game is superior in almost every way (except for tracking an animal's footprints, where COTW is better), but especially in the complete outdoors atmosphere, which is simply amazing.)

The graphics are very nice, but unfortunately you have to spend almost your entire time in hunter sense, which screws up the scenery a bit. (2022-08-27 After the patch this is much better).

The difficulty settings seems odd. I can understand why some people would prefer a realistic, difficult hunting experience, but for people like me who want to start up the game and just have the satisfaction of doing accomplishing something for a change, this game doesn't work. Even on the easiest difficulty, animals will be extremely hard to approach. I've had a few lucky hunts where I walk around and see animals and do a successful stalk, but it's rare. Maybe I'm not the best gamer, I'll admit, but, still, do have have to design your game for hardcore, tournament winning gamers only? Isn't that why you have difficulty settings in the first place?
(Edit: after setting the difficulty higher (Hunter setting), the setting just short of the highest setting, I'm having more success. Maybe the settings are backward? Or I'm getting better!)

The sound needs some work in my opinion. Most of the time it sounds like you're in a gale force wind, one that was recorded in a pipe. This is probably my greatest negative about the game. (After the patch, this is also much better, but still not perfect. For instance, when approaching trees, the wind sound through the leaves would suddenly kick in, instead of gradually).

Some bugs were experienced, like where I stalk animals only be stuck when I crouch or move prone next to a tree. Only way out is to fast travel, ruining an already time consuming, difficult hunt. (2022-08-27 Haven't encountered this after latest patch).

After playing some more:

Some suggestions which I really consider would go a long way in improving the game:
1. Allow fast travel to the vehicle.
2. Allow fast travel to the hunting stands.
3. Overall more fast travel positions.
4. Allow rest/time skip in the hunting stands.
5. PLEASE rework the sound! It's better after the patch, but still can do with some tweaking.

TL/DR  
Excellent visuals, animal behaviour, atmosphere. Some annoying bugs, not enough fast travel spots. With some work, this game has a very promising future. Very good work from the devs so far, now just do some polishing!",1661337461,1661594437,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

**I understand this is early days as well and if the Devs have the intention that these early issues will be fixed. 

That being said, for the time being, I am leaving this on a negative review. 
I have faith but as far as performance alone goes.. Ouch. The visuals are a blurry mess on Ultra (My specs are RX 6600XT, I7 9700K, 32GB RAM). It drops frames harder than any other game. 
MULTIPLE stutters as well. almost one every 10 seconds for me during the first 2 hours. 
Its really very jarring to move around the game world. 
And yes, the FOV. This makes it more so jarring. Its hard on my eyes even for the 2 hours (As of this review, 30 mins was spent trying to find the settings sweet spot, but dropping them too far down makes it look terrible) of play time spent. 

I have faith that Devs will rectify this game, but my it was hard starting off. My advice, if you want this game wait for the review turnaround from Mixed to Positive. I will update this as I see improvement. 

#After 13 Hours total now I wanted to add that the amount of stutters is extremely BAD. The gameplay alone has me hooked but I am getting extremely sore eyes from the stutters. It will jitter when moving in the car and on foot. Sometimes dropping down from 80fps to 4fps instantly and then back up and then back down. This comes in waves when moving but I wanted to add this. 

#After an additional 28 Hours and 1 update with minimal changes I am still experiencing LOTS of stuttering and hitches still. Frame drops are abundant. I have animals disappearing after being downed. I am monitoring them after not approaching them for around 10 minutes, then approaching and if I loose line of sight for just a moment the animal disappears. This is happening to now around 50% of animals. 
I am keeping this review negative despite playing as I have hope. However people these days are never honest with Developers and we let them release whatever. There's hardly any backbone to consumers. 

Its hard for me to recommend, I am enjoying the gameplay but I would want to also know the amount of unstableness that this game is right now. It looks fine for some and for others a mess. I sadly seem to be the latter.

To summarise, its good, no bugs found in my (short) playtime and the world feels like something i want to explore and get into, it gives that special feel of being out in the wild and hunting / exploring.

Looking into a new area and seeing animals and moving in towards them is fun / satisfying and it feels rewarding / worthwhile to keep exploring deeper into the map and new areas.

I have played approximately 200 hours of Call Of The Wild, and am at the stage where i just farm zones & fast travel around the map, rushing to each spot before the drink zone / feed zone timer runs out.

The main thing lacking from COTW is the animal draw distance, it feels pointless exploring through a map as you are never sure if you are actually walking in the right direction.

The graphics are abit funky and take awhile to get used to but after some tweaking in the NVIDIA control panel its now at a point where im happy (however sharpening is not supported yet) 

As others have said the blood tracking is useless and you often cant find an animal you have shot (and seen drop) right under your nose, perhaps there is something i am missing here or its a feature they need to balance.

Overall im happy and will play past the refund time, its a game where i want to explore the world and hunt

- achievements for perks not properly tracked at all.
- Stupid bugs like animals walking under water, Horrible FOV problem and tracking blood trails just vanishing, falling through graphics, etc. Missions that require you to hunt animals with a stat you can't see until their dead.

Then they tried to fix the various game bugs with their first patch. It was like pulling a lose thread!

- Frame rates sky rocketed!
- Players kills vanish before they can claim them it.
- I personally watched the individual deer in a herd I was tracking begin vanishing right before my eyes. Must be aliens.
- LOD objects that used to be in the distance now very close
- Purchased equipment went missing.
- Purchased hunting permits went missing.

 The list goes on and on. You could no longer just hunt. The animal would vanish or the tracking trails would vanish.

24 hours or so after that last patch that broke so much, they've offered a patch BETA that players can join to help test the patch to fix what the last patch (which was their first post-release patch) had broken. They advised backing up save files since the BETA may not be compatible with the full release patch later on.

This thing was rushed to market based on scenery and some base functionality and hyped up with Youtube content creators.

I was really hoping for it to be a good hunting simulator and as a fan of the similar game ""TheHunter: Call of the Wild"" I am going to compare both games but not too much in case you are new to the genre.

This game is as fun as I was hoping for! It's a more realistic approach to the genre compared to ""TheHunter: Call of the Wild"". Especially the hardest difficulty makes it feel like a realistic hunting simulation rather than an arcade game. There are currently 2 huge maps with I believe 14 animal species on each map. The game is beautiful and focuses more on perfectly hitting that one shot and I think that is way better than shooting one after the other. The game really wants to advertise ethical hunting, especially with the main story in singleplayer.

What really blew my mind is the herd management in this game. You can actively remove the low trophy animals with bad genetics from your herds to help the high trophy animals to reproduce, throwing their good genetics into the pool.

[h1]Singleplayer:[/h1] The singleplayer part of the game is pretty solid compared to the multiplayer issues at the moment. The main story is fine. Probably not needed for a lot of people but I am actually motivated to progress. It's way better than the lacklustre, boring approach of ""TheHunter: Call of the Wild"". The side missions are nice little stories that don't only give you money - you can also get hunting licenses for free that allow you to hunt in certain areas.

[h1]Multiplayer:[/h1] The multiplayer however at the time of this review is very buggy. Sometimes unacceptable buggy. I will mention them in a later section. I hope those things get fixed ASAP since I really want to play this nonetheless awesome game with my ahem.. friends if I had any.

[h1]Difficulty:[/h1] You can choose from 4 difficulties. The first 3 difficulties include the ""hunters sense"" mode, which basically lets you see all information for animals and tracks you see, shows you where noises of animals are coming from, calculates bullet drop and wind and shows you where your bullet is hitting etc. The last difficulty is the only one without this mode so it's arguably the best way to play this game. Like a real simulation with no fancy tips. But of course you can play it the way you want and I think that's really awesome. The difficulty of hunting itself can probably be pretty high for people new to this genre so just pick the easier difficulties for starters and animals won't be getting scared as easy. 

Worth to mention: You can deactivate the hunters mode or adjust what type of help you want if you don't want to play on hardest difficulty but still want a realistic experience.

[h1]Bugs:[/h1] Here is a list of all the bugs I have encountered:
[list]
[b]Single- and Multiplayer:[/b]
    [*]Missing blood tracks (already partially fixed)
    [*]You can get stuck in a tree, changing stance will fix it
    [*]Game crashes are common apparently, haven't experienced any
    [*]Performance issues - it's not that bad for me but could certainly be better. I'm at 50-60 FPS most of the time with a RTX 3070. For full specs you can visit my profile.

[b]Only in Multiplayer:[/b]
    [*]Taxidermized animals don't get saved
    [*]The right difficulty doesn't show up on trophies
    [*]Animations of other players can look very odd sometimes
[/list]
[h1]Look into the future:[/h1] The developers just pushed out an update fixing some issues such as the blood tracks missing and adding stuff the community has asked for such as ultra widescreen support, a FOV slider and key bindings. They also released a roadmap where they focus on fixing the game but also releasing some content not too far in the future. Content for FREE! That's right, we are getting new weapons, missions, animals, vehicles, ammo types, hunting gear and more for free! Now you might be wondering what is the DLC for? It's for 2 new maps.

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1] Overall this game is an amazing realistic hunting simulator and does so many things right. The developers are focusing on fixing issues and planning to push out free content. I recommend this game if you are looking for the best hunting simulator on the market.",1661548643,1661550019,True,117,2,0.9048309326171875,2,True,False,False

Hunter sense is just badly designed, marking color is bad, the way it highlights is bad. Even the info given in the blood analysis is wrong, the thing said the deer would die in about 50 meters and then proceeded to walk half a kilometre. You ui sucks too, I can't see if I'm making too much noise, wind is poorly displayed, analysis info goes out too fast. Then there's the fps problem, my pc is vastly better than the requirements and the game still has big fps drops. Also had problems with perfect shots not hitting the target and the character getting stuck, all of that in 2 HOURS of gameplay, can't imagine what I would face if I had to play more.

The simulation aspect is great and much more in depths than the the competition. Story is not the major point but it's here and it's not obnoxious. I'm looking forward to more content although the maps are really really huge space to explore.

Unfortunetally in the current state I cannot recommend it. The potential is there, I could also chop down my play time not to get ill from that fov but I've spent 2 hours hunting a one deer at the end of tutorial because for at least 4 of those the blood trail was missing and for one 4 star deer later I had only initial blood on the ground but nothing around despite whole herd being there and even that initial blood splatter disappeared about minute later and was replaced by patch of grass.

QoL changes are one thing, but this is preventing me from actually playing the game and after having around 1700+ hours in classic hunter and less so in COTW I cannot honestly recommend this game as it is now.

The first release is quite good and I'm really enjoying the game play.  The virtual world they've created is spectacular in its own right; exploring it on foot is breath-taking.

It's nice that the development team is using the hot-fix patch release mechanism - we don't have to wait months for critical fixes.

I'm looking forward to new and improved content: 

 I really think it needs tents as part of the gear we can carry (not the unrealistic Jetson's tent of COTW, just a place where you can set up camp and sleep) as the maps are huge. 

Real watercraft that we can use to freely navigate a map's lakes and rivers: perhaps an inflatable raft as gear, definitely boat docks at cabins with lake access, with a choice of canoes, zodiacs, power boats...

The Jeeps are great, but there are trails on the map where an ATV might be a nice option.

An optional vehicles DLC would be the way to go (I would not expect to get that for free)

When  tracking blood trails, animals don't seem to leave footprints.

A true topographical map (with elevation contours) using UTM conventions would be nice, with user-defined point of interest annotations, and the ability to measure distances on the map.

In real life, if I were hiking through this terrain with a full hunting pack, I'd be hungry, thirsty and tired after a few kms, so why not add the need to eat, stay hydrated, rest and recover from that exertion (I'll draw the line at bathroom breaks, though).

It's day 3 after launch. i can already tell im gonna love this game, the hunter sense and sound system is years beyond call of the wild, the blood splatter and tracking system is very rewarding. the post shot analysis *chefs kiss* and the long distance shooting is amazing + wind drift. the graphics are a solid 8/10 and it renders really well at a long distance. its been a long time since a game has made me not want to go to bed. this is much more realistically paced compared to call of the wild. maps are huge and diverse. i will admit i was skeptical at first. the fov is kinda bad yeah. but you get used to it and im sure itll be fixed in the future. it feels pretty solid overall. and the mechanics are what attract me the most. i was so submerged in my hunt. i havent felt this good about a game in quite a while. hence my review.

Edit: several days have now passed and i think i know the game a little better. 
first things first, i stand by my original review, will not change it. but i will revise it a little here. the game is kinda buggy yes, definitely in multiplayer. the one recurring bug i keep running into is getting stuck on a tree. which you can easily fix by going prone and crawling for a half second. the game does lack in the gun department. a variety would be nice instead of basically just 3 rifles worth using. next, the sound of the wind ""rushing"" past you, is bugged. theres a slightly hollow bugged sound to it. other than those few features, i have no complaints. the play style is exactly what i was looking for. ive got hundreds of hours in cotw and since this game has come out, id prefer it over cotw. its slower paced, more down to earth and realistic in terms of shot placement and wound times. yes ive run into the issue of getting a double lung shot and having the animal run a decent ways, but thats a given if you understand that the weapon matters more than shot placement (kinda, its the energy dumped into the body that matters most), because i, unlike many others, grew up hunting, everything. and fishing for that matter. but i digress, having different ammo type would be a much needed addition. id also love to see something like a 6.5 creedmoor as ive just bought one irl. i think my 3 fav things about this game are the wind drift in the shot, the really nice looking blood patterns and trails and the fact that blood can be on foliage. thats some bad @ss stuff. then lastly. range IS range. 800 yards feels like 800 yards. my longest shot so far is 834.6 yards and it was a doozy. double lung. and it didnt go far. one thing id like to touch on is that in real life, unless its clearly obvious it wont suffice... is that when hunting irl, as long as the guns big enough, caliber doesnt matter. meaning that its legal to hunt a deer with a .338 lapua magnum if you want. in this game ive noticed my .300 win mag is too much for a wolf. and it has my questioning the authenticity of that rule in game. why would it matter what i shot the animal with as long as it dies clean and fast? thats about my only gripe. i would love if theyd add blinds of any sort, or even a tent. im not a fan of only having 1 base camp for a map thats arguably larger than any of the cotw maps. it annoys me that i need to drop whatever im doing to buy a new gun or call or scope or whatever. i could be literal miles from base camp in a honey hole of animal and id have to leave and trek for 30+ minutes back to that spot. which i can live with. but dont want to lol. all in all, i love the game. its core is more solid than cotw. it holds true to irl hunting. the best hunting sim ive played since i was a child. and ive owned them all. no joke, 5 feet away contains a box of cabelas games for ps2. i probably have a dozen plus of them. im not some kid. im a grown man that grew up in the woods, and as i have a kid and full time job now, i only get a few weeks a year to actually hunt. so this bides my time, that being said, im picky about hunting games. i loved cotw for the first 150 hours and then realized that you can exploit the game by simply following water. simple as that. in this game, youll be lucky to kill 1 animal every 10 minutes. in cotw youll kill 10 animal in 1 minute. that alone should tell you all you need to know.",1660808851,1661519884,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

The animal AI needs a lot of work, the animals tend glitch out and walk in circles if they are spooked twice in a row. Animals will randomly spook for no reason at all from extreme distances, yesterday had elk spook at 250 yards, wind in my face and crouched. The perks are all bugged and you get the bolt action, shotgun, and lever action perks all by just using your bolt action rifle. You can fall through the world when fast traveling and if your are crouched or prone when you do this it unlocks all the movement perks for being crouched or prone. The description of the perks do not explain what they actually do, ie fast and loud perk says ""increase speed while crouched but make more noise"" while in reality it allows you to use the run button while crouched which makes more noise. The weapon sound are all the same weapon just at a different pitch. Walking near running water will make your eardrums bleed, they did adjust volumes for standing water which did help a bit but still needs work. The game has currency but it is useless after about 20 hours of play, there are no consumables and if you do the missions you can buy nearly everything by the end of the story. I know this seems to be a scathing review and despite all the problems with it, it really does have great potential. I think in 8-12 months, with lots of testing, this will be a great game.

Tracking animals and patiently waiting for good shots as well as animal movement partners are all decent. I would say they are great but i did have one situation a group of dear were just starting to cross a bridge and I jumped out of the Jeep blocking one side and they rand to that side and just ran into the Jeep endlessly. That was the only real instance I found animal movement to be odd. I have yet to see animals attack each other at all but if that is not a thing i think it would be amazing to run into. Not something that should happen often but that is one experience I have yet to have. All in all the games fun if you honestly want to just hunt.

For me, I think this is the hunting game I truly wanted ( until I find a better one lol )

The trophy system is more interesting than COTW, instead of grinding like hell to get a great one, you manage a herd to get a better trophy score. ( also less grindy )

The graphics look great, not in an artistic way since it was meant to be photorealistic, the drawing distance is also further than COTW. ( I can finally hunt 500m+ away )

The story is fine, I'm not really into the lore since I'm just here trying to hunt, it's not necessary for a hunting game IMO.

There are plenty of issues with the game ( go read the negative reviews ), but since the game was just released, I think we shouldn't judge that soon, and the devs are already working on it so good job I guess.

Content is lacking compared to COTW ( but keep that in mind that COTW has 5 years of content updates ) , pretty sure that they will catch up when they release DLCs in the future

I think I can fully understand the criticisms of others. On a personal level the FOV issue is not entirely acceptable, but it is something I can tolerate knowing that it will be fixed. There also some minor issues regarding performance that do not particularly bother me. Further, some features from other games that I felt were relatively inconsequential have been left out of this title, which more or less just makes this game feel like more of a simulator than, for example, COTW (which did not always feel overly arcadey to me).  That being said, the gameplay feels tight and satisfying, which is what matters at the end of the day. On top of that, I really appreciate the more interesting mechanics this game brings, e.g. aging, genetic fitness, more realistic movement, etc.

Does this game need some work in some areas? Yes. Are there bugs at some points that can lead to a random crash? Yes. Can this be overlooked to see the full potential of the game? Absolutely. Way of the hunter is one of the best and possibly best hunting games ive ever played. Definitely up there with TheHunter classic and call of the wild, almost a perfect blend of the two. What you have is a game emphasizing realism with animal behavior, firearms mechanics, scope mechanics, tracking mechanics, etc. There is also a difficulty slider to make it easier than in real life but you still need to watch what youre doing. As I first stated, problems exist and can be fixed which will in my opinion make this game awesome.

Pros:
- stunning visuals. I have great rig and the game looks amazing
- great sound. It really feels like you are in the forest.
- the shooting feels good.

Cons:
- really limited choice of weapons. There is also not good enough explanation which weapon/ammo is good for a given species of animal
- Awful tracking. I am spending way more time trying to find the almost invisible blood trails than actually stalking my prey. 
- Way too much sway on aiming. I know that realism is the goal here, but i have experience shooting with optical signs - here you are like 80 years old with parkinson's disease. Apparently there are perks which are supposed to make it more doable, but without them it's a joke
- I am playing on Adventures (something like ""Normal"") difficulty and the animals i faced so far are simply dumb. I am stalking them without any problem and reaching distances below 50 m (just to spend a lot of time trying to find their corpses later).

In few weeks/months and after few updates Way of the hunter may become a good game, but  right now it looks more like an alpha version, not a full release. So - after few patches i may change my mind, but for the time being this game cannot be recommended and it just doesn't delivers enough for it's money.
*actually, being an game journalist irl, my review is giving the this joke of a game a strong 2 out of 10. I will keep adding points to this review, as it's getting more and more ridiculous with each minute
- most of the wigs, bushes and tree stumps don't have any collision/clip. You can run through them, you can shoot through them, they are just not there.
- after hitting few animals with my car on accident, i tried to do it on purpose. Win! The ""realistic"" AI of the animals just doesn't care of your jeep (screenshot of a moose roadkill visible in my profile). Also, apparently your car is made by NASA, as even the hit with 200 kg animal doesn't leave a scratch on it.
+ you can't carry unlimited ammo like in CoTW. I actually like this. What i don't like is that the ammo is free. It's supposed to be realistic, right? However the ammo is free, which means that sooner or later you will be swarmed in cash
- guns and equipment. Really poor and boring collection. No different ammo types? No night vision/thermal equipment? No bows? Like 10 guns at all, and really boring ones?
- mission stories are cringe worthy. And how they were able to find THAT terrible voice actors? Laying traps in the actual forest, and hiring whatever catches in them?

***After 29.4 hours of gameplay on RANGER difficulty***

Bottom line I still highly recommend this if you are a hunting enthusiast or crave a realistic experience, with that said there is a lot to be desired.

First, Multiplayer.
Bottom-line, it's not worth it to play with friends at this time.

Only the host can claim animals and it has a host of glitches and performance issues on this mode.

Singleplayer is great, I did not play on adventure mode and from discord some people have had issues with tracking blood. Firstly it isn't easy, similar to real life. You need to hit a vital (pink blood or pink and air bubbles) just red blood means you maybe didn't kill it and the trail goes cold, it still puts you in the direction of the deer but it behaves realistically.

I say if you want a challenge and a real hunt play on ranger difficulty, keep in mind, it is brutal but any buck is a reward you're not just farming the game for a 5 star.

There are some day one bugs and this game is not for low end and some medium end builds, it is very resource heavy. I have a 3080 and have no issue at all but I see a lot of people have issues below a 1660.

Nothing game breaking on single player though, map is huge, animals behave like real animals.

Anyways I stand by my original review minus the multiplayer issue.

***Initial Review***
The negative reviews are from issues already addressed, one the devs already said they are fixing (fov,keybinding), two it's not that big of a deal cause there are ways to fix it outside a game fix (I get it should have already been in the game but here we are). THE GAME IS BEAUTIFUL! THE ANIMATIONS AMAZING! THE HUNT IS REAL!

If you liked COTW or you are into arcade animal murder spree games you won't like this.

If you have hunted irl, like theHunter Classic, or want a real simulation then I highly recommend this game. I also recommend you play it on Ranger difficulty. I hunted in Arkansas for decades irl and played theHunter classic for years and this most definitely scratches the itch.

Will update as I get more playtime but right now I'm sitting in my stand, drinking coffee, and just taking it all in.

Right now though I'm in love.

Support it if you're into this kind of thing cause it can only go up from here.

The issues people are griping about relate mostly to the FOV, which is annoying, but top priority in the next hotfix, ya'll are a bunch of babies.

Having played The Hunter Classic and CoW, this game does just about everything better:

PROS:
-No microtransactions(!)
-Free ammo
-More realistic animal behavior
-Herd health system is really cool
-Animals age and grow
-Ballistics are *chef's kiss*
-Proper weapon zeroing
-Tracking is far more intuitive and realistic
-Damage model is closer to Sniper Elite series
-Better graphics, environment, and sound design
-Actually takes time to locate, stalk, and track animals (Some may consider this a con)

CONS:
-Limited weapons and equipment compared to CoW. (Still has everything you need, 30-30, .243, .223, .338, .22, etc. but no handguns or bows yet.)
-Less maps than CoW
-Audio bugs are annoying, sound is poorly mixed within 100m of water, and occasionally it  sounds like an aircraft is doing patterns over your head etc. Not huge issues for me personally.
-Perk and character system needs work.
-Story is a little cringe.
-Blood trails sometimes disappear, seems to happen more frequently with .308 on elk imo
-Foliage and fallen logs have no collision or sound yet.
-Stealth system seems to be WIP, sneaking up on animals in wooded ar.eas is very difficult, as they sense you very far away

I didn't put the FOV or Keybind issues as those are on the short list to be fixed. If you like hunting, and play CoW because there's no good competitor, but find it a little too arcadey, give WotH a try. I was hesitant, but the game won me over within 15 minutes.

The bad
-Watched a fox walk across the ground without its legs moving
-Blood trails are hit or miss if they're actually going to be there. 
-When walking crouched you see your leg go over the gun. 
-Deer go WAY too far when shot, bullet damage seems like it plays no factor here, especially for someone who actually huts. You double lung a white tail with a 7mm round the deer is not going far at all but in this game it runs like 300 yards. 
-shoot a deer in the shoulder and it runs away at full speed.
-the focused mode makes your head hurt, not joking, actual headaches. 

The Good
-The blood on the ground when its there is super cool, actually on leaves and blades of grass. 
-Gun mechanics, aiming, the look of them etc, looks super good. 
-The game scenery is pretty. 
-The animals look cool, great design.

Overall, This game feels very beta, it does not feel like a completed game for 40 dollars. Its lacking a lot of common sense things that should have been fixed before released, as well as missing a lot of key hunting things that should be in the game. Will I continue to play it and hope for updates, yes. But would I tell a friend that its the best game ever and to buy it right away? no.

There is one quest early on in the game where I had to shoot a deer 'Hollywood'. After shooting in the head and following the blood trail, it eventually ended with no corpse! This means I'm still waiting to complete a quest with a missing corpse.
I've tried sleeping till the next day and going back to find the animal again - to no avail.
Only way is to restart the game....and trudge through the tutorial as far as i know.
Other methods I tried that may have worked for some people in the forums didn't work for me.

+ more realistic (ballistics, tracking, stalking)
+ weapon energy system
+ huge maps
+ no ""tent hopping"" but observing the reserve

CONS
- not ""that"" eye candy like cotw
- graphical glitches / bugs (prone makes you twerk, sticky trees, disappearing blood/tracks/animals, huge empty areas without animals/tracks/zones, walking/ moving animations and shadows are wonky)
- animal see through mountains and stuff (wind in my face, prone and spooking them from 300m)
- no bows
- no scent eliminator

World is huge and filled with details anywhere you go, even the most further edges of the super large maps. Every bit of game play is simulation, it is like real life. Those who complain that it is hard to line up a shot, they never hunted in real life before. This is not an arcade game, this is a simulation. If you like arcade like hunting call of the wild does that, this game is super realistic (and as such very difficult) hunting simulation. At that nothing comes close to this title, this is simply the best out there (not of the best, this is the best and only available in this category).

I have seen lots of complaints of other open world titles where the game world is mostly copy / paste of the same features and layout of existing design, well Way of the Hunter shows large open worlds can be created without cheating the system, this open world is worth exploring, variety is everywhere (however it helps if you know how real world looks like, to someone who has never been to a forest, hiked a trail, a forest all the same everywhere (to my wife for instance a forest is boring and all the same everywhere - mostly). I recommend this title if you strive for realistic hunting experience.

This is NOT a shooting gallery targets / animals appearing everywhere in front of you. Each achievement here is extremely rewarding for the amount of work, tracking, patience, skill you have to invest. Sometimes gets easy, but most of the time it will be hard.

If you consider Way of the Hunter you have to understand animal behavior using the game's database. Each animal has sleeping, eating, drinking habits each linked to a time of day. First you need to discover where the animal eats, sleeps, drinks, its area of habitation (consider multiple lakes and eating areas, not just one). Then you want to plan your hunt to frequent these locations during the ""right"" time of day for a certain animal type. If you just wander around aimlessly your result and efficiency will show this, the game will not make anything here easy for you. Try difficulty ""Adventurer"", that is what I am playing on, this setting is still challenging enough to ensure you ""simulate"" real life hunting experience.

Also, do not forget your scent and how the wind carries it. Open your map (TAB) and look at the icon representing you on the map. You should see a ""pinkish fog"" spreading in one direction depending of wind, this is your scent and its spreading in the forest. If you hunt 'downwind"" most likely animals move away before you have a chance to spot anything.

Map Size: After careful assessment I see each map (there are two of them) 100 square kilo-meters or about 38.6 square miles each. These areas are huge (I am 70 hours in and still barely left the few main roads and paths I managed to get to from the large network of roads and drive-able paths as I am always bogged down with tracking something), these are areas of 6.2 miles wide and about 6.2 miles deep. Also these areas are not system generated barren wastelands, these areas a handmade with highly detailed lands and shorelines, lakes, and mountain ridges and valleys, seemingly personal attention given to every tree branch, piece of grass, rocks, water flow in rapids, so forth and so on... This cannot be and should not be compared to google earth like environments (I would not even put them in the same class with other hunting games or even GTA5 level of world detail, while those maps are also considerably smaller), on such maps you zoom in a bit and details degrade fast, but this is not true here, details will never cease to impress in Way of the Hunter (also amazing animal detail and mechanics described above). Either way, this is a huge world, possibly never done before on this level maintaining this incredible world size all in one project.",1661020129,1661401665,True,7,1,0.519240915775299072,0,True,False,False

I have been playing theHunter COTW for years and love it, so I was hesitant to buy this but the bullet cam and claims of population management won me over. From what I've seen this is better than COTW in some aspects and lacking in others:

Story: Both games have it, and I ignore it in both. This one focuses a lot on ethical hunting, which I appreciate.

Approachability: With difficulty settings, this allows more customizability for more/less experienced players. I would appreciate a custom difficulty setting to fine tune settings (I want to play max difficulty but still be able to tag need zones and ""see"" the sounds but not get information about them)

Population Management: This claims that population management works and that hunting females will lead to reduced populations and such. COTW will just spawn the killed animals elswhere on the map from what I've read. 

Guns: COTW's, while not branded, feel better. The sounds are vastly superior in COTW. Why does the .22 sound and kick like a .30-30?, but this game could easily fix that in an update to come. Obviously COTW has many more guns but it's been available much longer. The major issue I have here is lack of bullet choice. COTW lets you choose between expansion and penetration (which would be great here, where expansion and penetration are very nicely modeled and displayed in the bullet cam) BUT more importantly, this only has birdshot for shotguns as of now. That is quite disappointing and I hope it is remedied. Shooting with shotguns is also very annoying in this as the shot does not go where you'd expect. 

Animal Behavior: While both games use need zones, the animals in this appear to act more believably and on higher difficulties, stalking is quite a challenge without feeling unrealistic. However, the believability ends once the animal has been shot. In this game a through-and through lung shot through both lungs and the vena cava takes the animal ~100 meters to actually die. The game itself knows that's wrong because when you analyze the blood splatter it gives a 50m range to dying (which is still quite high)

Calls: The calling in this is more realistic, in that you can't just spam calls willy nilly. COTW has scent sprays and scent blocker which this does not.

Map: The map in this feels much larger and emptier - which sounds bad but makes it feel more realistic to me rather than stumbling over animals every 50 meters. Neither allow you to draw and annotate the map past putting down a marker, which is unfortunate

Visuals: Both are great, but COTW wins in my book. The biggest issues I have with this is that some small trees when far away appear solid and makes you think it is an animal only to fade in the real texture as you approach and that despite having a 4k monitor and the game set to 4k, it feels like the resolution isn't great. 

Controls:
This was clearly developed with console first. Keybindings are not currently editable. However, the default controls aren't bad.

Wishlist in addition to the issues mentioned above:
-Camping/Deployable hunting structures
-Annotatable map: Place permanent pins with custom text
-More guns and gear
-Bait
-Hunting dogs


If this game fixes those issues as it develops and does not develop a predatory DLC model, it may well surpass COTW.

Here are some issues that need addressed.

Sound. The sound in the game is probably worse than any game I've played in the last decade. Not only is it bad, it's constantly buggy. Sound just suddenly starts from nowhere, and it persists even when you leave an area. It never is right.

Graphics. The game doesn't look ""bad,"" but it needs help. There is constant pop in when you play, and even on a pretty well built pc and a 3080 I still only get 90fps at 1440p. It doesn't make sense. 

Most importantly, fun/realism balance. I really appreciate the realism of the game, and what they are going for. That said, it is still a game. If I am running around the map for 20 minutes and literally don't see or hear a single animal, I'm done. This happened multiple times to me. That may be hunting, but it is not fun. COTW really got the fun balance down, and that's why it has been so strong for so long. Currently, nobody other than a die hard hunting simulator lover will play this game.

However, the animal reactions and early game mechanics are terrible. I posted up 150m, downwind, crouching, unmoving, and lifting my gun to sight the deer was enough to spook it. Which forces you to make longer shots, no matter how perfectly I would set it up, would end up only barely injuring the animal, slow death, which with the realism of the game is agonizing. 

Also there must be some other adjustments that need to be made. Animals would occassionally just disappear. I'd hear a deer 150m away, get out my binoculars and then no longer hear it or be able to find it. Frustrating experience especially as you're slowly having to move every where. If you want to skip time, you have to either just wait it out in the stand (a little too realistically boring) or go back home/campsite, sleep, and try again. 

Pretty frustrating, I'm hoping these are just some game release issues and I'll try to come back later but overall very frustrated.",1661386797,1661386797,False,3,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros
-Huge maps 
-Great Animal animations
-I  personally really like the blood tracking. I've only lost 1 animal that I've shot. It was a Moose I used a slightly underpowered rifle for and then a huge thunderstorm came in and cleaned the blood trail  I was following. (At least that is what I saw from my pov,  could have been a bug that the tracks disappeared.  Found the Moose 5 days later by accident).
- The story can feel heavy handed at times but I really like the comic background shorts.

Meh
-Graphics can be really blurry at times, feels like there is some sort of depth of field setting that makes every blurry you cant turn off. Otherwise they are good but not great. 
-Story can feel bland at times and heavy handedI see what they are going for but I feel like i'm being preached to.  Also the story can leave you thinking there are bugs with it.  For Example after doing a series of tasks you are promised a certain item after finishing, you dont get it until you do a couple more missions. 
-Need zones and the trails between them donest give you any information as to how many animals and you can't see the frequency of the need zones from the map.  
- Voice Acting is meh, sometimes its great, sometimes it sounds like they need another take. And some words are just plain missing from some of the confersistions. 

Cons
-Animals can be really inconsistent with spooking.  Sometimes you can sneak up to them with no issues and sometimes you can crawl from 150m away and they spot you through a hill. 
-Bullets can be stopped by twigs, wind seems to have a huge effect  on them, For example you can be 50m away and the wind will move the bullet 20-30cm. Also the bullet travel time seems really slow.
-Tons of texture popping at short and long ranges. Sometimes you are walking slowly and the ground just loses all textures then pops back in ¬Ω a second later.  Or you are walking along and you see a huge brown spot in the distance and think it's an animal and you zoom in and it's just a skinny little log that looks nothing like the brown spot.
- Game was clearly developed with console players foremost in mind. Basic pc features like keymapping and certain graphical settings are missing(yet can be found in photo mode).
-Sounds need a major rework for balancing from everything to animal noises, wind, the noise the player makes or doesnt(I still have no idea if walking through a bush creates more sound because there's no audio feedback for the player).

So I played this just long enough to get into the main loop of gameplay. Overall, its a decent game. The stalking , shooting is good. The environment is pretty and diverse. It doesn't look as good as COTW, BUT, I think it is more picturesque in someways as far as how varied the environment can be. Its also got a story and a little more variation to the missions, camps, and lodges as opposed to COTW. Where I think this game really falls short though is the FOV, inability to bind keys, lack of graphic settings like DLSS, FSR, film grain toggle, chromatic aberration, etc. It was very clearly built for consoles and than hastly ported to PC, as weve seen with numerous amounts of games.... Another big shortfall is the amount of equipment that's in the game. As far as I can tell, there are no blinds or tree stands or anything that you can take and build up along the way, all the hunting stands are already pre-built.
Compared to COTW, this game is more of a shallower arcade experience with SOME deepish mechanics. Focusing more on story and diverse mission types and keeping you moving. Not as good looking as COTW but still nice to look at. It also has some features not seen in COTW, like a full sized vehicle, hunter lodges, trophy customizations, etc. COTW on the other hand is still the more unforgiving nitty gritty hunting experience.

The game does some things slightly better than hunter call of the wild and some things either not offered yet or worse. One aspect that is much worse is the ham handed brute force effort to promote ""ethical"" hunting.  It is obvious the writers for this game are non-hunters in real life and assume anyone who plays a hunting video game must enjoy the suffering of animals.  They simply lack any understanding that real hunters hunt efficiently. An efficient hunter knows it's prey, scouts for hours to learn the lay of the land, the habitat and always seeks to make a heart shot.  Why? because hearts are near center mass of almost all hunted animals - the most efficient place to land a lethal hit even if the heart is missed.  This games  mechanics for shot ballistics is excellent as well as after the shot review.  Most gun action is spot on  (except for the .22 LR's).  Best feature is the distance to spot animals is much further than COTW. Animal behavior is solid  - particularly after being shot. Which brings me back to  efficient kill shots are ethical simply because the ensure minimal tracking. No one in their right mind chooses to gut shot an animal on purpose. Real life tracking is exceedingly more difficult than in game yet even in the game who wants to spend 40 minutes trying to track a 1 star  white-tail.... so lay off the campaign  story ethical hunting diatribes.  It's not fun and its really sappy.  Nearly kills  all the good that is in the game - beutiful environments and ambient sounds and good  weapon physics.

Game has minor bugs
Here is a quick list

Long Range instant kills dissepearing (500 - 1 km)
Long range fatal hits and blood tracks are dissapearing
243. has more powerfull balistic impact than 7mm 08
Calibers such as 300 WSM and 338 has higher MOA rates than 308...
338 can hit 3 moa groups from 1200 meters (egg size) with the platforms such as SAKO TRG'S And Steyr SSG-08 and yes Steyr barrels are all same.

Hogs can take a hit from 500 meters with 5000 Joule of energy transfer(338) and gets double lung penatreted and still can survive the next day and run couple KM's..

Game has great long range shooting/hunting potential related with the Unreal engine,competitors does not have this option related to their's so better long range accuracy measurements with ACTUAL stopping power is a MUST for a longer marketing LIFE
Trimming the aspects of realism for the general balance is fatal mistake which is alread done by Avalanche.

More open field territories  based on camp style hunting  neccesary.
From rabbit's to foxes to IBEX'S

Small caliber rifles with precise accuracy should be added for small game hunting, such as 17 HMR,22 Magnum with more open and long fields,
Like UK rabbit hunting with field map , it can be a game changer.
Right now small game options is nothing more than appetizers, most of the time players does not even carry proper rated rifle for thoose.

Improvements should be added for serious player base

*24 or 25 x Scope with a nice detailed reticle such as -APR 2 D MRAD, or Impact 23
Game already has licence agreement with Leupold.

""Leupold VX-6HD 4-24 x 52mm with impact 23 christmast tree style reticle gonna be  ideally suited, Reticles such as H59 can be over detailed for the balistic interface of the engine,but if its gonna add, it will be nice.
*Calibers such as 6.5 creedmor which has more knockdown power than 308 above 350 yards should be added and can be used for long range entry level.
*Shotgun chokes should be added for tighter pattern, longer range,
*Slugs needs to be added for under 100 meter hunting
*Rifled barrel shotguns with sabot slugs can be add for 200 meters hunting
*Buckshots can be added for hunting around 70 meters, but stalking AI does not allow to get closer than 100 meters on all medium/bigger game,most of the time
*Crosbows like ten point Vapor RS470 with ""GARMIN"" optics systems (licenced or without licenced) should be added for modern era stalk hunting and thoose platforms can be used around 150 meters accurately.


Game is much more realistic compare it to the others but lot of realism aspects are trimmed down because lack of the dynamics, especially in the balistics area, this is a a same huge mistake which avalanche already did, if players not get the advantage of the platforms such as 300 WSM or 338 with 5x25-56 mm why they are exist's in the game anyways,

Ultimate Hunting From SA games already working on this aspect very hard, from shotgun chokes to proper shot / stopping power management in every calibers, like I mentioned, right now lot's of realism aspects are already trimmed down wisely for protecting general balance of the game, 18 HD scope with 44 mm lens size does not give any actual advantage over 7x scope rather than nice visuals...

if thoose ones gonna adressed, with the improvements(which is gonna bring many different levels and layers for the hunting dynamics in the game)
Competitors will be gone for good, if not, platform can share the same consiquences with others when the new and better one arrives around a year. (of course if they can pulled out it like they promised)

That's my two cents based on 25 years of experience with everykind of firearms and field sports.

not finished

hunting is nice, mechanics of the animals are nice, guns are nice (except the .22 it sounds louder then the .300)
but...
i really hate the current notion of releasing unfinished games and then polishing while the community is basically beta testing it (for free).
so when they finish it, i'll change the review. as for now, here's my bug report on this testing phase game:

- animals spawning / teleporting on travel
- superglue trees (touch a tree and restart the game to unstuck)
- badly visible cliffs (slide down and get knocked unconscious at some random slope)
- bullets go awol passing trough bushes
- disappearing bloodtrails 
- falling trough the map on fast travel (good for unlocking a few perks)
- FOV is just, i have no words, horrible (and you can't change it). the testing crew (if it exists) should be fired and forbidden to test anything ever
- last but most important for me is the sound. there's something SERIOUSLY wrong with sound, the volume of certain ambient sounds is so off that you can't hear anything else except the wind at some points. also, there's a weird comb filter over it, for god knows what reason...

not a bug but a huge disappointment for me is the graphics, game looks worse then COTW, and is 5 years younger...

there are other minor things not worth the mention.
it's still kinda fun and will get a positive review once it's finished, polished, and gets a bit more guns.

First off what's good?
- The idea of the animal populations changing dynamically over time (health and count) based on hunting is awesome...if/when it works
- Most of the time it is a good looking game, squeezing some great vistas out of UE4
- The few weapons we have so far feel decent, and its nice to have more granular zeroing (compared to Call of the Wild where you have to unlock a perk to zero at all and then its just 2 settings)

The bad:
- Releasing a PC game without keybindings, and not even a menu to display the default bindings is beyond stupid, many bindings appear on screen in the relevant context(s), but some don't (like dropping a marker through the binos). Basically if people have to google the bindings for your game you have failed.
- No FOV slider also sucks but really a minor issue
- Bugs: they boasted about the amount of unique species being simulated but forgot to mention the thousands of bug varieties in the game. Everything from what you hunt having 0 impact to your car randomly clipping on the terrain, to animal AI completely breaking and just ignoring you, or the animals ignoring their supposed schedule etc etc etc, its bad.
- Graphical issues: game looks great when it works, but the anti aliasing solution causing a lot of issues with smaller objects, birds in flight quickly turn into a blurry mess for example, but turn it off and the foliage is terrible. Further some things don't render properly or at all, lots of issues with blood trails for example.
-Animal trail system, deer are not ants they do not all follow the exact same trails to the point of leaving highways visible from far away, and certainly not so many, the idea of following slightly more used trails to find common need points (resting, eating, drinking, etc) is a good one, but they overdid it. Trails look like a maintained foot trail with how painfully obvious they are, and in any given space there will be 5-10 of them crisscrossing each-other, in one case I found 3 perfectly evenly spaced running in parallel straight as an arrow for quite some time, its unrealistic and looks terrible.

The reason this is getting a bad review is the bugs. The SHEER amount of bugs. you cannot go 20 min in this game without experiencing SOMETHING. Blood trails disappearing, hunted animals teleporting, getting stuck inside trees often when you walk passed them, sliding down terrain for seemingly no reason until you are knocked unconscious, bullets that get blocked by 2mm branches, bullets with no hit reg at all, vehicle getting stuck inside flat ground, falling through the map when you teleport to a cabin while crouched... i mean the list goes on and on and on. 

On top of the fact that the setting are lacking VERY common and important options. (FOV slider, view distance slider, and the biggest L here is the no borderless fullscreen mode which 99% of games have.) 

This game is not finished at all. it needs a ton of polish and work still. its very fun but you need to swallow your frustration more often then not.

 The biggest example of annoyances is that the rifles sound the same and have the same bullet in flight animation.  The first time I fired the .22 LR in game it blew out the immersion of the game and made me chuckle as I watched at least a 30 cal tracer fly out and head down range while instead of the pop zip it hits you with almost a shot gun blast of noise. To most that won't be that much of a down side to me it was almost a no go for a released game it made me think what other nuance or obvious thing did they horribly maim. Like tree stands for duck hunting >_< 

That all being said it does tick all the boxes of a decent game if you are looking for a walking and shooting simulator that takes a bit of a grind. The best thing i have seen so far is the Trophy screen gotta say that is a big plus to see how the shot interacted with the animals body and how they went into detail of the damage listings. That was a great plus and probably what swayed the yes/no.

Shot placement, concealment (crouching, crawling, paying attention to your surroundings, ect.) the range at which you shoot an animal and what weapon you shoot it with matter sooo much. I see some reviews complaining about tracking blood trails and that doesn't surprise me with the game mechanics, there is a strong emphasis on stalking in close and making a good broadside shot. The animal maturity system really makes you think about what animal you want to harvest out of a herd. I got lucky and found a 5 star whitetail buck and it took me over 4 hours to get in range and get a good clean shot, the feeling after watching him go down 50 yards from where i shot him was one of the best feelings I've had during a hunting game and i have over 200 diamonds in the hunter cotw.

Completely valid criticism and kind of sketchy those aren't functional on launch, but I'd like to focus on the game and its mechanics itself.

For a quick TLDR, It's pretty fun and very playable, but it's a good little seed that just needs some water. The game play and the pacing feels a lot more like theHunter: Classic than COTW. Overall, it provides a very authentic hunting experience and forces the player to strategize and be patient. Other titles in the hunting genre can sometimes feel cheesy, but this feels like it is going for a more grounded and realistic perspective of hunting. That can be a very great thing for a lot of players who want a challenging experience. There is certainly a need for bug fixes, quality of life improvements, and some more content.

[b]What I Like[/b]:

- Graphics / UI -

Currently there is a noticeable amount of texture popping but I'm expecting this will get fixed. I think the anti-aliasing could be improved. The environment is beautiful, and in general the game runs above 60fps on mostly ultra settings though I suspect performance could be better (RTX 2070, RYZEN 5 5600x). I have no issues with the UI, it's pretty simple to use and looks good. You can tell it was designed for console, but it's just fine on mouse and keyboard. The harvest screen is fantastic. A lot of the sprites and blood trails also look pretty good, but I would really like to be able to see entry / exit wounds on animals. 
 
- Content -

There is a ton of content in this game, and a lot of animals to hunt which require varying equipment and tactics. The maps are crazy large in size and there's plenty to explore, and the different environments and habitats are done very nicely. I imagine there's a lot more to come, and can't wait for bows! You've got a fancy lodge you need to fill up with trophies, too! The game is lacking in some equipment, like tents (come on, we need tents that serve some function in a hunting game), blinds, lures, scent sprays, stands, etc.

- AI / Animal behavior - 

I've found some early launch glitches (birds sometimes get stuck in a weird flying animation, or they freeze completely in the air) but when it works, it works! The animals in the game have relatively smooth animations, and behave accordingly in regards to sight, sound, and smell. Hunting waterfowl can be a blast, and I've noticed the ducks make more realistic flying patterns than in other games. The animations that four legged creatures make when receiving impact is wonderfully done and accurate to real life; the old ""mule kick"" when you send one through and through a deer's lungs / heart. Or the quick electrical shock looking jump.

- Game play  - 

The pacing feels right on the mark. The voice acting isn't the best, but the story is actually pretty good. Again, it's a very authentic experience but the game makes it pretty easy to actually participate. You have a vehicle and don't have to hike everywhere, there's fast travel, you don't have to worry about paying for ammo, it doesn't feel like a grind in regards to leveling and buying new gear, map and compass, markers, etc. But when you're on the hunt, it's a hunt. You need to analyze every aspect of the environment, and find a way to successfully stalk or lure prey. And it requires patience and precision. Tracking a bleeding animal for two hundred yards can get frustrating, but you should've waited for the better shot, but you were amped up and excited because you haven't seen an elk that big before. Yep, this game is a proper hunting game.

[b]Things I like but think need improvement:[/b]

- Gunplay and guns - 

It's really not bad, but it's lacking something. I don't know if it's a slight camera shake or a bit more punch physically and visibly from the recoil, or better muzzle flash / smoke affects. It's just missing something in terms of feedback. The guns all look wonderful though and the animations are great. It's pretty neat that they got licensing from actual brands, too. The scope and binocular affects are good. All the firearms are accurate and generally do what they're supposed to do. I would like the ability to manually move the bolt action, or the pump when that gets added. A lot of games involving sniping have that now as a toggle and I prefer it that way.

- Ballistics / Damage models -

Good start, I like the idea of measuring energy in joules. The internal ballistics could use improvement, I am getting the impression that some rounds (such as the 30-30 and .243) are slightly weaker than they should be. I do love the idea of having different types of ammunition and loads to fire, though. Please add this! It would do wonders for the shotguns, too. They already pattern well but we could have the option to choose different shot size or slugs. Or if we could equip a different choke.

- Hunter Vision -

I honestly like the fish eye / distortion thing they have, but I do agree it could be toned down some. We also need the option to change the highlight color.

- Sound - 

Overall pretty solid, the soundscape matches the exact environment you're currently standing in. Sometimes I have issues picking up positional details from animals, elevation specifically. And there are some sound balancing issues for sure.

BUY THE DLC AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION. I recommend playing the base game for a couple of hunts/story missions if you're going to be dropping $40+ on this title.

The biggest highlights for me in Way Of The Hunter are: 

While all hunting games are walking/driving simulators, this one has a good balance between distance to travel between hunts.

Tracking a group of animals that you have spooked isn't like TH:COW where they will literally Usain Bolt across an entire game reserve to get away from you, so if you make a mistake or want to take out more than one trophy animal from a specific group, you aren't stuck trying to run after them without spooking them again. 

Shooting an animal from a distance leaves room for bullet deviation and overshooting due to the scope ranging system, which I find is lacking in some games where most shots seem to fly in a straight line (This can still be nice when you're lined up on a 5 star trophy)

/b My grievances with the game in it's current state: /b

There are a LOT of things that can trigger fatal errors while in the middle of a hunt which makes you have to restart the game.

Multiplayer seems to be more of a 'We threw this in here without working on it' feature, lots of goofy animation locks that require someone to either teleport back to a cabin or disconnect & reconnect. Hopefully this gets expanded on further in the development stages.

Hunter sense showing things in a sepia glow really makes it hard to spot animal tracks/markings over grassy meadows and in dense brush. Having coloured markers like in COTW would be a good remedy for this.

A lot of firearms and their respective ammunition which are REALLY GOOD for Deer/Elk in the real world seem to be under perfoming in this game. If I use a .243 Win or .300 at 50 metres and double lung shot a mule deer/whitetail, I'd expect them to run a few hundred feet IF they had the stamina for it.

Overall, I'm pleased with this game and will continue to follow it as it continues to get worked on (fingers crossed)",1661209694,1661209854,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I enjoy it, but it's far from ready to be released.  The most shocking thing I saw, is that a moose has antlers from an elk.  I haven't yet seen an elk in the game, but I won't be shocked if it will have moose antlers on it.  The trophy scoring system is horribly wrong, I shot a small 6 point buck that couldn't have an antler over 6 inches, yet the game scored it a 153 with a 33 inch spread.  WRONG haha.  Ducks often disappear when you shoot them, I've watched them drop near my feet, but are nowhere to be found to claim.  Enough ranting, I enjoyed my time in game, and it has promise.  But the elk antlers on the moose body lead me to believe nobody on staff for developing this game have an ounce of knowledge about actual hunting, or the animals they included in the game.

Edit addition:
no portable blinds or deployable stands
no tents for sleeping when night comes
no scents at all, not even a cover scent
Crouching and sneaking both, creeping against the wind, a herd will flee at 160yd in cover too thick to possibly even see you.
no bows or crossbows
Every species in the game is in packs/herds of 10 or more, even species who realistically are almost always solo such as moose, bears, etc.  you'll never find a solo trophy walking thru the woods, if you see 1 animal, there are at least 10
Oh, and the Moose STILL have elk anters on them, that has not changed",1660711591,1661208461,True,4,2,0.5014687180519104,0,True,False,False

The main one is trying to track your animal after shooting it - the activation of hunter sense gives you a golden highlight on each trace of blood dropped by larger animals, and a useful larger highlight on smaller ones, like birds. However, the vegetation is often quite yellow in tone, making the highlight hard to spot. This can be worked around, to some extent, by moving the 'Vegetation' quality slider to 'Low'. This provides a lot more open earth between the traces, making them easier to see.

I was a little disappointed with the quality of the graphics. They aren't bad, and this game has a much larger render range than CoTW, but the textures used (especially in the trees/bushes/grass) are not as good as the older game. CoTW is much better, both in sound and vision - especially if you use Reshade to tweak the settings.

While the actual hunting may be more realistic in this game, the fact that none of the vegetation offers cover from the animals (unlike CoTW) and there is no way to see or hear how much noise you're making results in unrealistic travel between shots. Your only company is the constantly loud rush of the wind, and (if you get near a river) a matching loud rush of water.

The 'hunter sense' feature is annoying at the beginning, as it only works when standing still. You do unlock the perk to have it permanently active fairly quickly into the game, but CoTW effectively has this always on, and also allows adjustment of tracking colour, to allow high contrast with the vegetation.

The story missions are worth following through, as some of them provide entertaining interludes between hunts. The other missions are varied: some easy, some trickier - but all provide valuable cash to buy new weapons and equipment. Also, doing missions from the other characters around the parks will allow you to unlock the areas where you cannot hunt at the start of the game without paying the 4500 credits for each area.

It may sound like this should be a negative review, but I do like the game. I think - despite the criticism of the graphics up above - some of the animals in this game are rendered in a much better way than CoTW. Some still need work, however. (Mountain goat, I'm talking to you...)

This is a different sort of game to CoTW, and it is possible to enjoy both, but be aware that using tactics from CoTW will probably mean that you don't see any animals! There have already been patches to improve the game, and the road map released a couple of days ago shows that the developers are listening.

Tracking can almost feel impossible at times.
Many time you feel like its just a wandering simulator. Hours without seeing animals.
Unlike COTW you cant audibly hear animal warning noises. until you have spooked them...
The hunter sense tracking color often blends into the surrounding area. 
every weapon only has 1 type of ammo. 
gun shot sounds are hit and miss. sometimes it sounds decent other times not so much
when playing multiplayer if you or your friends use a call regardless of distance in your headset it sounds like you are. 
no weapon really tells you anything about it, ballistics, range, drop, muzzle velocity, etc.
WIND it sucks. Not that its in the game i would expect it to be. but the rate it increases and never changes direction and it always just seems to put you back to the wind when your trying to stalk and never gonna hit that shot. unless you drive or walk ALL THE WAY AROUND. you cant plan on driving to the farthest side of the map and walking into the wind every single time you want to play. 
A few more things im not sure how to word properly. i will come back and edit when i can figure it out. 

The things i do like
Herds when you do come across 4 legged animals and stalk them. they really move as a heard and it does feel like a real hunt. 
recoil looks amazing and manageable. 
graphically stunning. 
walking through brush sounds way better then COTW
i do really overall enjoy the game.

If you are worried that the bugs might make for a bad experience wait until they are fixed and then definitely buy the game. 

The thing I enjoy the most is the realism and how the animals behave and react to you, it feels quite natural.
Even the main story is kinda entertaining and I was surprised at how good the voice acting is in this game. It's mostly just radio chatter but it does the job.
There are also a tons of upcoming features that have been announced and even without those, there are probably around 100 hours you can easily sink into this game. I'd say that's worth the asking price.

Just fast travel back to a lodge, enter the safe and it automatically reloads your guns. For those saying there's no tent, park your jeep within walking distance to where you are hunting and all your purchased guns can be accessed from the back of the jeep.

I enjoy shooting long range targets in real life, so having the ballistics simulation is awesome. The animals behavior is much better than CoTW. The use of real guns, scopes etc is really cool. The conservation aspects of the game are great too.

- No Keybind remapping 
- No FOV options (Caution for those prone to motion sickness)
- No bow's
- Animal tracking is very difficult to see. Sometimes vanishing (bug being addressed)

Nice that the singleplayer part saves where you stopped, so you can continue a hunt/stalk/track when you come back. Very singleplayer friendly.

Con's:
Keybinding cant be changed and there is no where to see what keys to use for what. Good luck putting down a waypoint with you binoculars if you dont google/youtube/etc.
Both maps are very heavily focus on forest and mountains. Haven't found any really open terrains so far.
Hunting sense works akwardly - the glowing effect is annoying and the color matches the grass, making it very hard at times to track. Weird, fish-eye effect that just makes the graphics look worse.
Animals are very limited minded, herds are ""on rails"" both fleeing and traveling, especially waterfowl, which comes right back to you within 2 min of shooting and wont spook in the air. Most bigger animals only spook a few 100 meters before being perfectly calm again, making herd-wipes very easy. 
Water-fowl is implemented VERY basic. You more or less have to stomp on the birds to scare them off and the come right back. No blinds, lures, calling does'nt seem to do much to them. Just stomp around and shoot - but the value of each bird is so low that its just not worth it. You cant spot most of them due to the heavy amount of reeds, so your really just hoping a 5 star pops into your sight some day.
VERY limited gun selection, shotguns are useless for anything else then birds, so you only really need 2-3 rifles and everything is covered - and you can only buy around 10, all but one are bolt action, making them identical besides ammo.
Once you have tier 6 riffels, you wont really need anything else, although you take a money penalty, but your trophies are fine. 
The shooting seems a bit too simple, regaining breath after holding it is very quick, using hunters sense is just an advanced aim assist, wind doesn't do much at all and although the elevation feature is nice, its mostly pointless for shots within 200m for most riffels.
Although ammo is free, you are limited to 2 guns at all times and there is only a single lodge per map where you can change this.
Shooting animals with a higher tier riffel cost alot in meat (=money reward), but its almost rediciulus how much meat is wasted. I shot a goat with a tier 6 riffel, it weighed 22kg, i wasted 20kg on a chest hit.
Trophy mounting is VERY simple, most mounts have 2-3 positions for the animals you can mount, no rotation or anything like that. No rare fur/feather types as far as im aware, limiting trophies further.
There is something with the scale of the game that seems odd to me. At normal walking, im going at around 10-15m/s, which makes the map seem somewhat smaller to me. Sure, the scale of the map sounds fine on paper, but if i can travers it on foot so quick, it seems a bit fake. And the scale of walking-running seems off. Although running is somewhat faster, it really isn't much, compared to the noise you make. Sneaking and prone is also tedious slow! Also - the player character feels oddly short! I feel like my head is between my knees when i look down.
Alot of the missions is very simple: Go to camp site, pick up trash 5x, done. Deliver something to lodge B from lodge A. Go back to lodge A to get next mission. Go back to lodge B to complete next mission... Way to weak and with 600-1600 credit rewards, you can fast forward to most guns with barely any hunting at all.

In all - not a bad game, but if your looking for authenticity, realism and a challenge, go to COTW instead.

Some of the issues can be boiled down to ""git gud"" - if you don't get a real good vital organ hit, you're never gonna find that animal, the blood trails are so faint and sometimes disappear even with a good shot (known bug). So, practice more to make sure you have a good shot, I guess. 

The weapon tier vs animal tier isn't directly correlated, so there's lots of bouncing back and forth to the in-game encyclopedia and figuring out the energy requirements to get a clean shot. It'd be nice if that were less.. complicated.

Some of my complaints are at least mildly resolved through enough play, via the perk system (like hunting senses requiring you to hold still, once you achieve the necessary perk it works while moving). It's still a difficult game, imo, and I'm not even on an advanced difficulty. But I guess some people like that. I'm sticking it out because I'm stubborn, but if you don't have patience this definitely isn't the game for you.

PREVIOUS: I was looking forward to this game, pre-ordered and everything. I do like COTW so maybe my expectations were off, but it looked like it may have improved on some of the places COTW lacks. I guess for a certain kind of player, maybe it does. I have a good computer and the graphics are still choppy, deer who sense you do a very horror-movie-esque ""look forward then snap their head back to you"" animation at high speed which is pretty immersion-breaking. 

I guess some people like having to spend a half hour tracking something's blood trail 30 yards but I'd rather see what the game has to offer, enjoy the scenery, and heaven forbid maybe get a nice trophy or two (this coming from someone who has all of one diamond in COTW and it's a dang bird, so I am certainly not an arcade-shooter or farmer, I play these games to relax). If it's a long trail, then fine, but when you have to look around for 30 seconds every two feet to find any glimmer of anything, the dang herd might well blunder past me while I'm bumbling around for all the attention I'm paying to anything else. Staring at questionably-rendered grass isn't enjoyment, for me.

The blood is so hard to see (I have walked right over it on dry ground while I was actively looking for it), there's no option to change the color, you can't see it unless you hold still (so the hunter sense makes it glow - VERY faintly) so it's a lot of turn-wait-turn-wait-turn-wait just trying to find the next dang spot. No real directional hints, and heaven forbid the thing ran through a bush. Bonus: some plants have little bits of red in them naturally anyway, so that's a nice.. touch. I saw maybe two tracks during my playthrough, despite seeing dozens of animals.. I just think the difficulty has been amped up too far through unnecessarily artificial means.

You can only equip two guns at a time, and can only cycle through your equipment via mousewheel (on PC). You are limited to 20-something rounds of ammo on you at a time, depending on weapon, and while the restock is free, you have to return to a storage box (though your car probably counts, but I'd rather not bring that along everywhere and scare everything off) to restock. No bringing extra if you're going to be out for awhile, no planning ahead. No changing your weapons without being at that storage box, and no way to see what you have equipped (as far as I can see) without being at a box either, so I hope you remember what you're holding and what power level it is. The tips indicate the hunter sense while scoped would tell you if the weapon is appropriate for the animal you're aiming at but either that isn't implemented or I'm just stupid because I see the distance and energy level but not that last part. So, I wonder what tier those deer are and if this is the right gun. A mystery! More artificially-imposed difficulty. The whole process of these games (stalking, etc) is time-consuming enough (and that's okay!) without having more nonsense thrown in to mess up what you've worked for.

I guess it's a good game for some people and I'm not refunding it, I still am staying optimistic that it'll be better eventually.. but I'm disappointed in these and the other issues that have been pointed out. I feel like it definitely could've made a better showing for release. Maybe my opinion will change when some things are fixed.",1660686334,1661143648,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Yes they are similar, but that's a good thing. COTW did a lot of things right, and WOTH improved on a lot of those concepts. The animal behaviors are much more realistic.  
The pheasant hunting is much better than COTW and while not as good as hunting simulator 2, it is more action packed.
The big game hunting in this game is a ton of fun up until you try to harvest the animal. If you don't see the deer die, there's no way to know if you killed it or not. I've shot plenty of deer IRL and they die much sooner than they do in this game. On top of that a lot of the animals despawn after you kill them. I've watched countless ducks fall out of the sky only for them to flat out disappear, no glowy thing, just gone.
The game as it currently stands is just meh, but if they fix the  bugs and continue adding content I can see this being the new go to hunting game.
Changes I want:
If I double lung shoot a deer, it should be dead within 20 yards, not 2 hills over and despawned.
If I kill a badger with my 7mm it should still be worth something. We can only carry two guns, I'm not gonna waste one of my slots on a .223 very often.
Could we make the jeep drive a little faster please?
A better selection of weapons, There's more spice to the firearms world than just Steyr. Larger ammo pool and different ammo types would be a nice addition as well.
The duck hunting could be improved upon big time.
Flashlight?

Things I like:
The draw distance in this game is awesome, the world looks great, guns are beautiful.
The map design is actually really cool and a big improvement over other games. same thing with the pings.
Big game behavior is really cool. The sound of deer crashing through the woods running away brings back memories. 
The training for the game was fun and actually felt natural.

Overall I think this game has a ton of potential and it's playable as is, but with some work it could be the best hunting game out there. 
Please make animals die at a realistic speed, I'd really like to be able to pile up a herd of boar and not be forced to kill one at a time in order to maybe find them. It's a game, let it be fun.

Right off the rip, the tutorial simultaneously overwhelms you and tells you jack shit. The genetics system is barely even brushed in the in game encyclopedia and God help you if you try to listen to YouTubers. In the simplest terms, a mature animal with a low star rating needs to be culled, good luck trying to eyeball it because at any distance the LOD is too low to tell what you're aiming at. On the harvest screen under the ""Overview"" tab, you'll find the animals rough age and ""fitness"" level. [b]The lower the percentage of the fitness level, the worse the genetics of the animal.[b/] 

When you start a new game, it beats you over the head like Cain with a rock about ""ethical hunting"" and random rules that really make no sense when you start. These rules are used to attempt to force the narrative of River. One of these dumb rules is to not take a shot longer than 200 meters, which if you've done any amount of hunting IRL, you'll know has infinitely more to do with the shooter, rather than the limits of a firearm. [i]NOT IN THIS GAME![/i] I don't know what weak ass powder loads are being used but the .30-30, .243, and even the 7mm-08 seem to barely squeak the bullets out of the barrel let alone get them pushed into the animal. There's also a ""recommended"" energy level for each animal in the game but it may as well be a requirement. As soon as the bullet drops below that rather arbitrary level, the bullet turns to a glorified nerf dart. Despite all the hammering of ethics into your head, you seem to be locked into using an FMJ type bullet that never expands but creates a staggering amount of hydrostatic shock that never seems to reach organs before penciling through the animal.

You earn money via selling the corpses of the animals you slaughter for fun, hence the size of the animal is rather important. Being the smart person you probably are will lead you to believe, ""I should probably use a bullet on the weaker end of reasonable to save tissue damage!"" And in this game you would be [b]WRONG[/b]!. God forbid you use a bullet too small because for some reason it absolutely decimates the carcasses. Case in point, I shot a moose in the neck with a 7mm-08 from 250 meters away. Is it a good shot? Not at all. Did it get the job done? Absolutely. Just apparently too well, because when I harvested the moose she had miraculously lost 43kg of weight from an under-powered shot to the spinal cord. These bullets would change the hunting market forever if they actually existed. Long story short, if it's too small you fucked it, if it's too big you also fucked it.

All of this said, I obviously love the game. I've pour an entire day of my life into it so that must mean something right? It's just immensely frustrating because for everything they got right they got something else terribly wrong. I have no doubts that if the developers listen to the community this will be the absolute best hunting sim to date. But it needs work, time, and a lot of care.

This game is probably not for everyone, it needs patience and if you want to hunt a lot of animals in a short space of time, it's likely not for you (TW:COTW would be better in this regard). But as a true-to-life hunting simulator, it's excellent. There's some bugs and limitations on release, however this is similar to many games and the developers have already released a roadmap of bug fixes and general optimisation going forward.

If you are new to hunting games I would recommend the Hunter Call of the Wild over this to anybody. If you have already played the Hunter CotW this game will severely disappoint you, or it did for me anyway. 

CONS.
-Buggy as can be right now with no early access warning anywhere. 
-Multiplayer is so buggy I literally couldn't play with my friend (I have the recommended system requirements).
-The feel of the character is a little weird but that's not such a big thing.
-When facing animals I have to right click to pull up sights about 10-20 times before the sights will actually come up.
-Laying down on hills makes your character vibrate (how are you supposed to hunt like that).
-I have noticed that the Morning Silence shotgun is trash, the only shotgun that's not double barrel and I shot at a group of about 18 geese flying around 30 yards from me with my sights right in the middle of the group and shot 5 times as they flew away, MISSED EVERY SHOT didn't get one goose out of that which is ridiculous. I'm not a bad shot at all.
-There is so much fine tuning that needs to be done to this game it's not funny (really should have an early access warning. I don't know if  they consider it to be or not, BUT IT IS AT LEAST AS BAD).
-NOT WORTH FIFTY BUCKS
-Also the tutorial takes so long that by the time you finish with it your 2 hrs is up and STEAM WILL NOT GIVE A REFUND NO MATTER HOW BAD THIS GAME IS if your 2 hrs is up. So what I'm saying here is that you basically don't have time to try the free hunting after the tutorial, which I might add that the animals you hunt in the tutorial are meant for you to get them so they are way easier to get than the other animals.
-I had an experience where I shot 2 geese on the water with 1 shot and then shot another one as it flew away, upon harvesting, one of the geese I got when I shot 2 with 1 shot had turned into a pheasant and the one that was flying away had turned into a badger. (I did get a good look at all of these animals they were all geese before I shot them, and there was no pheasant or badger in the background. Plus I only got one goose, one pheasant, and one badger out of the deal). 
-Sometimes shooting a flying animal in flight, will cause the corpse to teleport somewhere else and no blood trail leading to it.
-The story with I think her name is April and her brother is so stupid that I have been like   >:{   the whole time that it plays. I'ts just so dumb.
-Have not seen any albinos or variants like that, I think the only variants are fur darkening or getting lighter with age.
-I feel like I'm forgetting something I should mention about this but I can't think of it right now.

PROS
-More realistic hunting in a way but it does make it one of the hardest hunting games that I have played.
-Free ammo (not sure it's a pro, rather than a con).
-Great job on graphics, seems like that's all any game dev cares about these days, it can barely be operational as long as it looks good.
-I like the fact that you can place your choice of 2 colors of way point red and blue, and you can have both colors of way point at the same time, you can even have multiple blue ones at a time, but only one red at a time.
-You HAVE to zero your scope to the right distance or you WILL MISS even if you compensate for bullet drop and wind (wouldn't call it a con but I don't know if it is a pro either only because it is annoying).

To sum things up I wish I hadn't bought this game. I have over 800 hours in the Hunter Call of the Wild and have only had one problem with that and the devs are finally on it and fixing the problem. I have 20 hours in Way of the Hunter and already have a list of complaints. The pros definitely do NOT out weigh the cons especially considering that there is a way better option for a hunting game. Even though the Hunter Call of the Wild is like 150$ (game and all dlc, which is a lot of content, well worth it) I still would recommend it over Way of the Hunter any day. Way of the Hunter is an okay game at best 1 and a half stars out of 5. It might get better over time. 
Considering that my dad came to visit on the day I bought the game and I forgot to exit the game (was not playing the game while my dad was here) it ran my game time to 8 hrs (I had barely got to shoot the badger in the tutorial which is like the second or third thing they have you do) so Steam wouldn't refund me even though I explained the situation (to a computer), I guess I got stuck with it. I hope the devs are ready to do a lot of work to this game. Just wanted to say one more time NOT WORTH FIFTY BUCKS.",1661120236,1661120236,False,9,1,0.509469091892242432,0,True,False,False

Tracking of shot animals can be difficult but after some practice and usage of markers its not as difficult as it may seem when starting out.
But a Major flaw i found in the last 10 hours is Bird hunting. I havent found a pattern in which Birds take off which makes hitting them so much more difficult. The flying animations are wacky at best making it almost impossible to hit flying targets (There is a quest that requires exactly that!!!). My aim may not be good but only getting 4 flying targets within 10 Hours is...extremely unfun. Also the game crashes quite often (like every 3rd or 4th time i scope the sky) when i scope the air for flying targets but it never did before i started and hasnt done since i gave up on shooting flying birds.

SINGLEPLAYER: I've spent the vast majority of my time in single player because I hate people. Not you, just people. I love you.

In my 60 hours I've not had a single game breaking bug that caused any aggravation or frustration; but that is not to say I have not experienced bugs. 

I've seen rivers turn into dry beds; I've experienced the tree glitch on a couple occasions; but was able crouch/crawl out of it. And I've seen some pretty wonky animation glitches, though temporary; quite unsightly. 

MULTIPLAYER is jacked. It's not unplayable, but at least on PC you can seemingly avoid many of the most common issues by avoiding use of the jeep. 

As it stands, being primarily a single player gamer; I am satisfied with my purchase and have thoroughly enjoyed (and continue too) Way of the Hunter. 

if you are a multiplayer ""dependent"" ; and your entire existence depends on being able to play games with other people; do not buy this game in it's current state. While the devs have confirmed that optimization and fixes are en-route; you will not be satisifed with your experience. 

If you're like me, and minor visual issues are not a huge deal to you; you'll likely have a quite memorable experience. The game is hard, if you make it hard.  It's impossible, if you make it impossible. It's got some interesting game mechanics that mean there are direct consequences for being overly aggressive or uncalculated in your target acquisition. Essentially you could do serious damage to the wildlife populations if you play like rambo; thus the ""There's no wildlife"" claims. 

You will have to hike to find your targets; and if you're incapable of being stealthy; you will never see them. 

You'll have to land lethal shots, double lung, heart, or Central nervous system shots like the spine or the brain if you're a monster. Otherwise, have fun tracking them. 

Animals will heal over time if you don't land a critical shot. This means your deer will stop bleeding and you will ""loose the trail"" or it will ""dissappear"". Follow the highlighted blood trails with hunter sense after landing a successful lethal shot and you'll be fine. I've only lost maybe 5 targets so far, so I'm content with the ratio. 

I've only had one instance that I'd shot at a Mule Deer buck without a doubt having targeted the heart; and upon firing, nothing happened aside of alerting the deer and he chose to stare at me like an idiot before advancing on my position with curiosity. I've only seen it once in my experience of the nearly 60 hours I have put in at the time of this review. 

This is my experience, this is not the experience of all. This concludes my final review. Bug fixes are coming. Regardless of whether or not they should have been addressed before release is irrelevant at this point, so I'll not kick that dead horse.

I had reservations for this game almost immediately, it is so poorly optimized that the opening cut scene was stuttering. I have a good PC (an AMD 5800X3D and a 5900XT) and the game runs awful, despite my frame-rate supposedly being good (more than 100 fps). Even on max graphics settings the games visuals are fuzzy and often times, especially with fast moving animals, a blurry mess. 

As I am sure many reviews here have pointed out, this game launched without a field of view slider or the option to manually set keybinds. The default field of view is rather narrow. It is puzzling why the game launched without them.

There are a number of small bugs, which mostly just made the game more frustrating. Bugs like going into the storage menu to find the mouse cursor invisible. Looking through binoculars to find that you have to hit the button six times to stop looking through them. Blood splatters being invisible when you looked the first three times in an area and after 15 minutes of frustrated searching seeing them where you know you looked before. Nothing game breaking, so I tried to be patient.

My patience ran out when I encountered what I consider a serious bug, that has apparently permanently affected my game. I was tracking roe deer and found a drinking zone. I activated the zone, saw the information pop up on screen, and excitedly went to the encyclopedia entry for animals, just to find no entry. I exited the menu saw the pop up tell me it was a drinking zone for a roe deer, but no following pop up telling me an entry had been added to my encyclopedia. So I found another zone for roe deer. Same thing. No entry in my encyclopedia. I am afraid that the game bugged, because I hit the menu button after discovering the zone too quickly. Now I can not get an entry for roe deer, no matter what I do. I was really looking forward to hunting roe deer, as it was one of my favorite things to hunt in Hunter: Call of the Wild.

This game clearly was released far before it was ready and I do not have faith these issues will be fixed any time soon. I have asked for a refund, but I am not confident I will get one because I pre-ordered it about a month ago and have played a bit too long. I regret pre-ordering this game. 

Strongly recommend waiting, if you are considering purchasing it. Honestly, you should look into Hunter: Call of the Wild instead.

During my 19 hours of play, I had one fatal error crash to desktop, fell though the map twice (had to restarte) and experienced the sudden intense stuttering twice, which also forced me to re-start.
The bug with the disappearing blood trails I had only ONCE. I followed the trail to a large rock and it disappeared (and I spent 20 mins searching all around)- I suspect that the deer clipped though the rock in the same way I had fallen through the map on two other occassions.
I was not really bothered too much about this, but I can of course understand people who would be annoyed by this. 

I still recommend the game.
I am having fun, I get a lot of joy and playtime out of it, it is relaxing and I really enjoy the story. 
At first I thought I would hate the story, but actually, it is gripping, well presented and the story missions are challenging. 

If you want to buy this game now, is up to you- the devs have promised to get rid of some of the bugs soon, so the whole experience will be a lot smoother. 

My previous review which is still valid: 

Just started on this game and I like it!
I have always had a soft spot for hunting games, and this one does a lot of things right.
I can run it on my potato laptop (not on high settings, though), it has not crashed yet, the game worls looks great and you can change difficulty and environment to adapt the hunting experience to you skill and mood.
I also did not think the tracking of animals was too difficult, I did not have any problems so far. 
Animals also behave realistically, I have not noticed any odd spawns or similar.
While I am happy with my purchase, I cannot really judge on the realism of the actual hunting experience.
I am no real life hunter, just a wildlife biologist who enjoys the occasional venison. 
But this game is definitely less ""arcade"" than ""The Hunter"".
Nice relaxing game for a nice stroll in the woods, with fitting nature sounds (including bird song).
The hunting challenge can be adapted to your skill, I am however happy with the ""adventurer"" setting. 

Recommended it you like a nice, slow game, where you have to take your time to sneak up and stalk your prey.

First of I want to bring up animal behavior, wow I am shocked at how well they were able to capture animal behavior of the big game species. Excellent. not leaving out the water fowl and upland game birds. Yes they are actually that stupid in real life. It's true, I didn't make the rules I just try to follow them. The devs, have managed to capture the behavior of animals to the point where I have forgotten that I'm playing a video game. The animal behavior it's truly authentic. It's makes the game challenging and very rewarding the first time you bag that 5 star Mule Buck you feel like you have just unlocked the greatest achievement of all time. There is an intimacy to this game fostered by a unique system that requires you to hunt carefully. If you kill to many of those trophy bucks hopping around you are going to end the gene that makes them trophies. If you kill too many of the female species you will end population growth. If you don't kill the bad genetic carriers then the blood line will be contaminated with poor genes. The devs have place a management system in this game that gives you a sense of responsibility to the animals on your land. This system forces you to think about what you are shooting and why. You don't just jump in your truck and head out and kill everything that moves with out cause or purpose like literally every other hunting title. No no you place careful decision making into which animal you harvest. If you push that heard of white tales for a  few days to many, guess who is packing their tails and going to a different territory. Manage the game on your land properly and you will never run out of world class harvests. There is a level of immersion here that is second to none in it's genre. Animal anatomy is absolutely flawless from young bucks to the big mature pot belly old boys that keep the does happy. It's all there and its's meticulously designed. So much so that people that have never experienced nature will never see. As far as bugs have not seen any that would fall outside of the realm of natural. Nothing game breaking or really even inconvenient every aspect of the game works really really well. The maps are large and absolutely beautiful. Made with a truly thoughtful artists touch. The vehicle drives smooth and seamless. The economy is well balanced and fair, no a rile does not cost 25,000. The ballistics i to game... well I have a few things to say about them. 
There is a ballistics charts with bullet cam 3d footage of your shot placement, excellent. There is impact damage!! YES! THANK YOU!!! I hated COTW had no impact damage, no damage path of the bullet. There is windage and elevation to consider based on wind speed that players need to consider before taking a shot. EXCELLENT!!! everything looks good until 
Here it is my only true complaint. THE RIFLES. 
They  need to be re worked, well not all of them. the 7mm-08 is a high performing rifle that will down really any North American big game save a Moose..mabey a Moose?? It's a very hard hitting bullet that is bigger than a .270 and more on par with a .308 the devs have placed this slap daddy in the .243 category pushing the same impact velocity of a bullet far far inferior to it. Fix this please..please...please. We do not need three of the same rifle one of which you get for free. remove the second 243 and put in something else. The .308 is an absolute slap daddy of a round the thought that it cannot be used to kill an elk or bear or moose efficiently is insulting and the dev team that worked fire arms did not consider really anything about the weapons in their game. A .308 is Americas all purpose rifle. literally. 
If you shoot a deer with a .308 through the front shoulders ... you will have nothing there left to sell or eat. it will be completely destroyed. A .308 is not a deer rifle unless you really hate deer and want to slap them in half. Ok moving forward bear with me here. The class system need to be reworked. Once that is reworked I think the rifle systems will feel better and not in places they dont belong. Oh yes the lever action 30-30 well well well you guys pissed me off here. This SLAP DADDY is an american classic that will blow a hole in you 3 in wide. It is not a varmint gun!!! It's a massive SLAP DADDY  that will blow a hole through brush and small trees and kill what ever is on the other side. Fix theese guns please. 

Out side of a few over sights, this dev team has put together a potential masterpiece that with some work will come to fruition. This game is fun, very challenging, rewarding, very realistic and incredibly immersive. It is hands down the best hunting title on the market and ever made. Thank you that that will be all

1) I see no other difficulty level other than Adventurer. Still trying to find that hidden gem.
2) Performance issues. I have a RTX 2060 12 GB Graphics and I am boasting maybe 40 FPS I know it is not a grand card, however it does run on the lower end than I was hoping for. But, it is still playable for me.
    If I could have a wish list, I wish the developer would have a help web page. Question I kept rising in was the stated above different difficulty levels, Do you take out only mature bucks with a 1 star or young 1 star bucks and are they considered low fitness deer, What about the doe's. Does a mature doe count as low fitness also. What is that lighter red dot around the darker red dot in hunter sense when looking through a scope. I am sure I will come up with more than this but, there are way to many questions not answered for the game.
    For the above for me, I will give this game a 7/10

    Update 8/20:
    Last night, my son and I finally had the opportunity to play multiplayer. It is totally broke and I feel you cannot play in this manner. The list is massive with problems:
1) Fast traveling to the lodge both host and  guest would fall through floor of the balcony ( Minor, but annoying).
2) Guest occasionally cannot get into their own jeep. Only to fix this was to fast travel back to lodge.
3) Wind direction is totally broke. Host wind direction was different than guest wind direction on map.
4) Guest was having a difficult time harvesting animals.
5) ALL mounts not in lodge. Guest cannot see mounts or host also.
6) Cannot place ANY mounts in lodge in multiplayer.
7) on one occasion, host floated away in the air leaving 2 geese on the ground only fix was to leave the game and re-enter the game. Upon coming back to pick up harvests, It said he could not pick up harvest due to not being his harvests (This is not ethical at all! I now have 2 dead geese laying there due to not being able to harvest them).
8) Cannot change time in multiplayer.

   This is only a beginning list of massive problems with players across all platforms including X Box, Playstation, and PC. My sons list even on single player is long. He is having a lot of problems with right mouse click to bring up binoculars, getting stuck on trees also. I now being able to playing and listening to his problems, I do believe The hunters sense does not calculate for windage in scope, only for elevation.
   The learning level of this game is very high including which firearm will work on a animal due to having to memorize how much impact of the bullet, how close you are, animals always moving. Do not expect high level 5 star animals running around due to constantly having to ""cull"" ALL herds. I am starting to see more 3 stars on Mule deer due to working one mission to cull the one star adult and mature bucks.
    After having multiple hours of playing, for me I am able to play single player with minimal problems in the beginning I also had minor issues with right mouse click on the beginning binoculars I am no longer having the issue (I cannot even figure this out). I have not had the tree hangup problem yet however the problem exists for others. Time will tell.
   For now I will have to give the game a 0/10 due to multiplayer totally broke. A 6/10 for single player due to monitoring REAL data problems on steam threads.
   For any one looking for a REAL comparison between Expansive World Call of the Wild and this game, You can't. CotW is a more arcade, run around shoot this and shoot that Kind of game. It also from day one has been riddled with bugs including missions being broke to the point you cannot play them, the new bug list alone during the new DLC was at least 4000 or more complaints. The trophy rating system is definitely arcade including a ""Great one with grass in the rack"".The racks do not look natural. There is no bullet ballistic utilized at all, I feel I could compare a lot more. On the other hand Way of the Hunter is a lot more realistic ( little overkill in some aspects) including realistic ability of spooking the animals from scent,hearing and sight. Bullet ballistics are more realist in that they do use real data. The firearm models are licensed firearms including Steyr, Winchester, and several other firearms as well.In a nutshell, if you expect to hunt in the same manner as CotW as this game, you will probably complain about this game. You have to have a very high level of patients, willing to learn a high deal list of content including firearms tier levels, bullet ballistics game mechanics and animal behavior for a far more realistic hunt.
   The other note is the developers are being very transparent on what is coming soon and they are more focused on fixing the issues first. This make me very happy, I hope....",1660714034,1661025309,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Roaming around looking for need zones at a snail pace to not try scaring anything away and see nothing. Animal trails are static and not dynamic and animals dont even follow them, and need zone times dont mean a thing. I spent an hour following a trail of moose tracks with 'looks fresh' poop. Only to find nothing when the trail ultimately dead ended. Spent 15 minutes circling around to see if i just couldnt find the next one, and nothing. Callers work no more than 180m distance, so you might as well shoot them before calling. Guns and 'classes' dont matter, for example, the .338 lapua gun in game is a class 6, moose is class 6. Going by the game guide has recommended max bullet energy at around 5200j to be effective. The class 6 gun doesnt drop to 5200j until ~ 300m directly into a 8m/s wind. At a cross wind, that jumps up to ~500m.

90% of the time animals do not call out unless you are calling them. Which again, you have to be within 180m and more or less already see them, so it is pointless. Theres no way to track animals unless you shoot them, and they do not stick to their patterns or paths.


8 hour revew:
While an Ok game in itself, it does come with issues at launch. No customization options, you are locked into playing one character only, cannot adjust keybinds at all (some are quite inconveniently placed) Or even look up what key does what unless you play with a controller.

I've played for 8 hours and have experienced quite a few bug issues. I've been stuck on a tree that i had to fast travel to get out of. I've had deer dissapear and pop in directly in front of me, I've had one hard crash (fatal error), 2 menu locks (Opened menu to a blank screen, unable to do anything and have to altf4).

I believe the game has potential, the game does look great, the animals do behave more lifelike (saw a flock of Pheasants take flight when a fox ran by them, but that could have been coincidence since i was right there), and their behaviors are more life like (not always sticking to the same locations).

If they can fix the config issues left out of this console port, add more customization, as well as variety of animals (IE different fur colors and patterns) I think this game could be worth it.

I feel as though the devs made this game out to be something its not. I get they wanted a realistic hunting experience however there are too many things  wrong with this game. 

Lets start with hunter sense. It's 100% useless. You might as well not even use it as a way to track your kill, you'll have better luck walking in circles up to 300m away with a lung shot. I'm telling you, they should get these animals to play for the NFL cause nothing is bringing them down in any distance remotely close to where you shot him. Blood trails? Not really. Tracks, forget about those if its a highly traveled area (read static tracks). So much for ethical hunting when you spend hours looking for your kill. And lets not talk about what happens if you don't hit a vital. Not to mention that hunter sense doesn't work while moving. Who would have thought that looking for signs of your prey would require you to stop moving? 

And why isnt ""M"" key bound to the map? Why do I have to hit esc then click on the map? Being able to pull up the map with one keystroke should be a basic in any modern game. I can live with bows not being available, but no hunting dogs? You want ME to flush out birds, then shoot them out of the air, then try and figure out where they fell without the use of a hunting dog? I thought they wanted this game to be realistic but instead its just needlessly pointless. Graphics are meh. Hunting blinds are put in the most useless of positions. Not being able to have a portable bind is insane. No scent eliminators? No ammo selections. And the achievements? Are you serious right now? 5KM in a prone position?  

Sounds.. in general are just lazy, The river sounds are either full on, or non-existent. In a blind next to a river?? How would you know? They don't make any noise. Get out of the blind and its loud as hell. The ducks on the water quaking sound like they flew right over your head but are still floating on the water. But keep telling me how this game is realistic and ethical. Are you telling me that you couldn't take the time to actually use distance and location for the sounds in the environment to make it more realistic? The idea that you could improve a herd by culling the weak was a major selling point, however given the amount of effort it requires to harvest your kill....

If COTW looks pretty on the surface to you but feels like arcade unrealistic junk once you dig in then you will love this.  Did any of you play COTW when it released? It sucked and i mean it really sucked. No lodges no truracks... it was horrible. This game has that already. I have 650 hours on cotw. This game destroys COTW and it also looks better. No more  animal levels on this game... they actually have age and grow and the culling is FAR more realistic.  It doesnt have that arcade feel cotw tried to use to cater to the low attention span minds that obviously know zero about hunting. COTW also broke  the golden hunting rule where the design makes you feel like you have to shoot anything and everything just for respawns to see something different  instead of letting it walk so it can grow.. Sorry cotw but that was a TERRIBLE idea and WOTH put you to shame .  If the Predictability and boring behavior of animals in CoTW just pissed you off then you will ABSOLUTELY love this. The same animals don't come at the same exact time every day. It feels like HUNTING. Also they wont come walking right back to a need zone if you spook them. The hunt is pretty much  ruined if you miss or spook the animal.  If cotw was not hard core enough for you then this game will not disappoint you.

However, that being said if you don't already have COTW, give this a go it has potential. The mechanics are basically the same - move into area, either hear animal or spot a few hundred yards away, check wind direction, move closer, shoot animal, track animal, click 'collect'. Rinse and repeat. I do like how this game gives you missions where you go after a specific animal rather than just running and gunning around the countryside shooting whatever you run into. I really wish there was a game where butchering and packing out the animal was part of the game but I suspect I am in a small minority on that one.

As many people playing this, i am as well a hunter and avid outdoorsman.
This game has great potential and the world and hunting itself is amazing of how accurate it is compared to it's competitors.
It's still a little unpolished here and there, which i'm sure will be fixed in the future.
Bugs like the legs glitching in your player model sometimes, the player model being ""short"", the overall POV is generally not that great yet... so the typical ""we shipped a half-done game"" which is very common sadly. The Ballistic system is amazing and *i love the ethically hunting* - ""gimmick"" which wants you to hunt *properly* and not just play CoD in the Woods (even though i'm sure you can do that also, but it's not rewarded obv). 

On the other hand, if you don't mind playing a somewhat-beta game, which will probably improve a lot over a few months or even year, but do enjoy the hunting aspect of this very great game, buy it.

You are allowed to free roam the entire map, and able to hunt most of it, besides the corners and seemingly high traffic areas, which are unlockable with in-game money.

First impressions after about 3 hours solo play though the starting missions (up to the ducks) and 3 hours with 2 friends:
Much better foundation for a hunting game than TheHunter Call of the Wild
They give you a return to main menu button upon game release, unlike The Hunter: Call of the Wild
You have multiple species to hunt out of the box. We saw WT deer, Mule deer, pheasant, badger, duck, moose, bear, and fox. Guns sound good. The details you get from claiming are very nice. Game is pretty to look at. Character animations are decent enough, I find they are better than CotW. Vehicles felt right. Tracking mechanics are more realistic than most hunting games, and you can loose deer if you didn't make a good shot. The deer react to you differently depending on how they sense you, smell, sight, you shooting. Rather than just having them be 'spooked'. The breakdown of your shot when claiming is probably the best i've see so far. There is something that pulls me into this game more than most other games... I just feel it is less arcade like, and more grounded. Which is a very welcome change.

Going into cons:
There is a limited selection on brand of weapon. Seems like they have a thing with Styer, with that said, they do a good job having different rounds to chamber them in. I only saw one duplicate. More weapons seem to be coming and this is straight-forward to resolve. There was some desync with the group we had. Having some of my friends floating a bit where it either corrected itself or they fast traveled back to cabin. This only happened upon claiming deer. Moose, pheasant, badger, didn't cause this. There are some weird audio sources like water that reach farther than they should. A weird glitch where I couldn't get back in my car, but could after respawning it.

The game, as a hunter, has a really good focus and message:  
The game seems to push wildlife management, if you kill all big bucks, you will take them out of the breeding pool. Genetic disformaties may need to be culled from the herd. You can alter breed speed and conditions by hunting a specific sex of animal. Needless to say, the game leans you to not shoot everything that moves. Also tracking is more realistic than most games I have seen, so you don't want to shoot multiple for that reason as well.

But it slowly becomes unplayable as the glitches start to stack up.
* Sound glitch - duplicated wind noise, keeps overlapping so you practically hear a constant buzz.
Sound like a flamethrower or an airplane. I can no longer hear my characters footsteps.
Gradually gets worse the more you play.
* Blood vanishing for some animals, often after second shot.
*No blood coming up (animal found dead) when shot in water
*Visible bugs
*Stuck in terrain
*Crashing when opening map
*Falling through map
*Animals fall through map at times.
*Ingame oddities like all weapons sharing the same perks. Shoot 100 ducks and get perks for 100 animal shot with rifle.
*Perk system is flawed, first you get a boost, next perk they nerf you back down again.
*Water becomes invisible when fiddling with graphics
I can go on forever.
All bugs that ive written was experienced by myself playing normally.

This game however has the highest potential out of any hunting game. By Far

Negatives:
No colorblindness options(i'm not colorblind but a software dev)
Cannot disable hunters sense vignette(causes headaches if you use it too long)
FOV not part of the game(likely to effect people with motion sickness.)
Keybindings absent from the game. (X to drop markers in scope BTW)

Time to expire on a clean shot is WAY TOO LONG. Even the tool tips say time to expire 0-50 yards. [spoiler]Consistently find the animal at 150-200 yards away. This is a bug and also feels very unsatisfying. From a role play perspective feels like you have fired a bad shot and make an animal suffer for longer than you should. From gameplay perspective, you have to walk 2 football fields following a blood trail trying to get your kill. [/spoiler]

3 gear slots, 2 pieces of gear total. (it would be nice to get snare traps for varmints to go with that 1 rimfire or scent block...)
 - 2 pairs binoculars
 - Why is the camera not a piece of gear?

""Choice"" of weapon types
 - 8 bolt action rifles
 - 1 lever action rifle
 - 1 semi auto shotgun
 - 1 semi auto rimfire rifle

No ammunition mechanics. Cannot buy more, it just comes back when you rest i think. 
Would like to see a Reloading bench mechanic that allows you to mix and match bullet weights and tips. 

Animals are too skittish to use the blinds effectively. Merely climbing into one alerts them and they run off. Introduce a Wait mechanic in the blinds so you can speed up time.

Sad, really, i was hoping for better than Cotw , hearing dev and people saying its more realistic is actually funny . The truth is its a game like it or not , so in the end the realistic approach only last as long as you wish it . nothing stop you from fast travelling setting time then go out spot walk a bit shoot harvest rince and repeat ad nauseum , 

The game , also . revolve around need zone , so if you're not at the right place at the right time you wont see much life  , was exploring the map on foot not  sprinting just walking around , the map are actually pretty one of the 2 good point about the game , in 2 hour i saw nothing it's a big map full of nothing ..... I find it funny that going to work everyday i see more wild life irl than in a hunting game and i live in a urban area lol .  

Of course if you set your time correctly lets say 9:00 am and go where there water you will find plenty of game , its pretty much the simplest way to hunt ... need zone  are supposed to be random but its just mean fast travel rest and repeat  animal will be there.

I did find the animation of the animal more realist tough, they did a  good job on that , but that pretty much all that is good with the game , map and animation .... So in the end its Cotw without the quality of life with the excuse of realism that pretty much only slow you down after you kill an animal tracking the blood take some time , especially in dense tree/foliage area . 

Its bad that the boring part (harvesting/claiming) take so long would have much preferred the hunting part to be the most chalenging  since you know the animal is alive, should be harder to find than is still  dead body  ....

And finally it dosnt help that the money in game come from selling meat of the animal, pheasant badger ...etc aint worth the time to hunt them compared to deer /moose other than mission and personal trophy there no point in the other animal 

nearly forgot ! bug plenty of them enough to make other game jealous , mainly graphic one like glitch, ragdoll and one that was hilarious : shot a deer but blood said not gonna die so didnt bother tracking it ....change day find same deer shoot kill harvest and it was a zombie lol first bullet actually gone trought both lungs and an artery yet he was alive and kicking to receive is second 2 lung bullet the day after fun stuff  ....

ps: apologies for my bad english and ofc its mainly my opinion milage might vary , but i think it dosnt add anything to the hunting only to what come after.... like i believe most of the time spent playing will be tracking dead body instead of hunting animal",1660951970,1660951970,False,4,1,0.512096226215362549,0,True,False,False

Stop trying to put stories in Hunting Games.

I don't mind missions to shoot certain animals and do certain things. I don't want a game that's full Arcade mode like DH2005 use to be, but I don't want to sit here and dive through deep lore and solve mysteries, or spend a ton of time looking for signs of animals so you can report to some writer for a book they're making. That's not what a hunting game should be.

That said, a big issue for me are firearm related. I personally hunt with a 30-30 for deer. This is a very solid choice, but the game seems to discourage you from it. There are other weapons and reviews that point out other calibers failing to do what their real life counterpart should do as well. Most firearms can, and will, put down a deer over 100 yards away with good shot placement. This game punishes you for thinking about taking a shot like that. It missed the mark. 

Animal behavior is very sketchy at times as well. I ran over several upland birds with the jeep because they spooked out of the brush, and landed in front of the jeep as I was driving because the game didn't know any better. I've also watched several deer disappear in to Narnia on this game to never be seen because of a small noise that was made. 9/10, Deer are mostly curious animals, and if they wanted to pattern deer behavior correctly, they would double back if they were unsure of what spooked them. 

I get it, you're not going to get it perfect, but this doesn't meet the mark on a vast majority of what real hunting is. This game overall feels like a group of people who went ""Oh, this is hunting"" without ever experiencing it and threw a game together in a very limited market to make you feel like this is hunting. While I'm not totally pumped and yearning for a full on virtual real life hunting simulator where you sit in a stand for hours at a time to see a few animals and harvest them, I'm at least hoping for something that truly emulates what hunting is. 

Performance wise, it feels half baked and needs more time to flesh itself out. Maybe one day I can return to it when QOL adjustments have been made, but for now, this is not a $40 game, and I'd wait for a sale and give it time.",1660950997,1660950997,False,2,1,0.479041904211044312,0,True,False,False

Many objects are just non-existent assets, you phase straight through them, so do bullets. Very narrow weapon selection, I have an entire skill tree for lever actions, but there's a single lever action in the game, and you start with it. Stands are unusable because when you climb the top step you apparently make the noise of a thousand dump-trucks in a narrow city block, everything in 400 meters runs instantly on the attempt to climb one. Sound design is ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. I don't think at this point that there actually is any directional sound, a sound comes from behind you and the hunter sense says it's in front of you, this is consistent at all times. Or the sound comes from directly on top of you. I feel at this time that they are actually just sounds generated in with no direction at all. Tracks are not real, they are spawned in assets to let you know that something does actually reside in the area, but they were not made by a specific animal nor will they lead to one. I actually like the blood trail system and i feel that was well designed. What I don't like is that there is no environment interaction with animals, which can make the blood trail system unnecessarily difficult to follow at times as the foliage the animal plows through is not effected and the trail can spawn under grass. Vast majority of weapon cartridges are artificially under-powered with what I can only assume was the intention of offering incentive to buy new weapons, I shot a badger with a 30-30 at 50 meters and it ran off....The game has some good concepts and it has potential, but it's an early access game despite what they market it as, with a long way to go.

The maps are miles ahead of ""Expansive Worlds"". They feel alot more authentic and are in general gorgeous.

The gunplay is really satisfying and allows you to shoot at extreme ranges

The animations are beautiful and feels really authentic

-:
Gear amount feels a little lackluster. I would like an option of a better bino and scopes with better zoom. The amount of different weapons also feels a little bleak.

Tracking is tedious at time because you have to stand still to show signs and it spots in waves instead of showing what you can see. (I have also experienced tracks not appearing for animals I shot a bit away, it might just be the tracking issue i have again though)

Settings really need to get more options. A few examples I found are: Amount of motion blur, sensitivity more precisely, changing keybinds and graphic settings need more options.

Set it to Ranger difficulty and have at it. Shot placement is extremely important in this game, which I love, tracking blood can be a bit of a pain sometimes so you better make your shot count. I also love the population mechanic, if you shoot more low score animals then the population of higher score animals will increase and vise versa, this makes it worthwhile to go after the lower scoring animals.

However it does have some problems that need fixing; Animal Calls do not seem to work at all, I don't know if they only work within a certain range, I've tried to call Whitetail Does with the grunt caller just outside of 200 yards and it didn't seem to affect them at all, they never came closer, you would think that if the animal is close enough to hear me walking then they would be close enough to hear a call. 

Animal AI can be wonky at times, I've had multiple occasions where I went on a shooting spree at a water zone because the deer straight up stopped reacting to me, I could walk right up to them and shoot them in the face from point blank. 

While Deer Stands are scattered around the map, I really wish they would add a deployable tree stand so I can set up where I want to, I'll often find a good spot downwind of a need zone only to have to prone the entire time and have terrible visibility. 

And lastly, you knew this was coming... MORE GUNS...AND BOWS! Some AR platform rifles would be nice.

Get credit for some zone finds but not all. At times I see the animal calls sometimes I don't. Sometimes I can hear the other players making calls sometimes I don't hear them making calls. Also in multi player noticed the animals sometimes blip in and out reappearing several yards away from last spotted location. These are issues I would expect from an early access game but this was supposed to be a complete game as reflected in the price. The other issue mentioned by many players also is the lack of instructions for PC gamers, Take console and shove it where the sun don't shine. I would recommend this game but only after they fix what plagues the game like Covid -19 has plagued  the world.
Game has potential for spectacular play, as best hunting game ever but, as it sits now frustration is the word of the day, if the Devs don't fix bugs before adding more content.",1660944721,1660945282,True,5,0,0.542103290557861328,0,True,False,False

The graphics are very good, with two massive maps to explore with fantastic terrain variety and a high quality of detail throughout along with a decent animal variety for launch. To note I am currently playing on hunter difficulty, mileage may vary depending on your choice as to how easy/realistic you like your experience.

Pros:
- Great graphics.
- Realistic-esque shooting/tracking with a decent starting selection of firearms and gear.
- Customisable difficulty and some hud elements.
- Decent animal variety.
- Fantastic animal animations and behaviours.
- Ranch management e.g. culling weaker or lower quality animals to improve genetics in your herds.
- Customisable trophy lodge: you pick which animals you keep for taxidermy and which stands/scenes you want to use.
- An interesting and original story element with main and side missons: you can choose to progress this which will naturally have you exploring different areas and hunting different animals or choose to ignore this and do your own thing.

Cons
- Some minor bugs on release i.e. some animals appear laggy at longer ranges, some audio bugs with driving and falling through the map when spawning.
- Limited multiplayer at launch: no missons etc in co-op as yet, no functionality to see others kills or ratings.
- Some weird audio levels and sounds: for example, running water is often far too loud even for a small stream, some animal calls like ducks are way too loud for their range and need to be toned down.

Overall I am thoroughly enjoying the experience and recommend the game. I am very excited for future updates as there is so much potential to build on this.",1660941762,1660941762,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Never before have i spotted a herd of deer and decided to just move on without even thinking of putting my finger on the trigger. It happens quite often in Way of the Hunter though, since there rarely is a reason to shoot young or female animals for example. The game makes you think about your population and if/when to shoot. Even a big male could grow into a bigger one. So i keep coming back after spotting something interesting, to see how it grows and only then, after some time, harvest it when it reaches its full potential.

Thats also why i keep trying to get close enough to use the photomode, so i can take a closer look at my population and maybe take a picture of an animal i might be wanting to come back to at a later time.

Shooting also feels really good:
-theres a good variety of scopes that have different styles and feel really nice to use
-most rifles sound really good (they could be a bit louder and have more echo though)
-the feedback when you manage to get a good hit on a deer is very authentic

sadly there is no manual chambering atm, but you can hold the trigger after a shot to delay it until release.

I'm now ~38hours in and still in the honeymoon phase but theres also some problems and things i dont like.

-smaller vegetation often seems to have no collision/sound when moving through it (it still counts as cover though)
-sometimes the .308 plays no sound when chambering while looking through my scope.
-the wheels of the jeep seem to not have any sound but the suspention is really loud.
-there is a very limited amount of antler variations atm
-no rare fur variations (they are planned for a future update)
-you cant disable unlocked perks that you may not want to use
-im already starting to swim in money / there is no mid-endgame moneysink other than taxidermy
-ammo is free and there are no ammo types
-small game hunting does not even come close to being as good as deer / big game hunting

Right away I think I prefer this over COTW. It appears to be a bit more arcady and easier, but overall feels cleaner and more approachable. The car and the ability to jump adds a surprising amount of depth and doesn't feel out of place. There are some things I don't like though. 

The FOV is very very low and I think we need a slider ASAP. Low FOV helps seeing far away things, however it makes walking around in tight spaces or indoors sickening, and taking in the scenery less cinematic.

There are a bunch of bugs concerning pop-in, animal pathfinding as well as ragdolls glitching out, but so far nothing game breaking.

The scope view feels pretty weird, especially coming from COTW. Hard to describe why.

It's a bit on the expensive side for having just two reserves and a couple of guns. I'd also prefer to have a choice when it comes to which ammo I'm going to use with my guns, for example, shotguns can only shoot birdshot, rifles all shoot a nondescript projectile.

I made the right choice because let me tell you one thing - the game feels just right. It has beautfiul landscape, a great atmosphere, realistic animal behaviour and the most important thing at least for me and I'm sure for many people as well it simulates the realistic flight of the bullet. It's been fun for me comparing the flight of .22 caliber to 7mm. When you shoot, don't release the trigger (left mouse button) as then you can see where the bullet lands.

I would strongly recommend giving this a try if you are patient enough because this one is as real for a hunting game as it can get right now on the market. I think the price is justified for what you get right now.

the first and most painful is how bad the tracking system is. unlike CoTW while there are footprints, blood pools and droppings, the god aweful hunter vision and lacks of direction cones makes it impossable to track animals for more than 5 feet. mabye they wanted it to be realistic without direction cones, but because the huntervision often doesnt see 2 feet infront of you, you end up losing your buck within 3 feet.
i shot the buck hollywood in both lungs meaning it made it about 5 feet and died and spent 30 mineuts looking for it because the blood trail just stopped and gave no direction and the hunters vision couldent see anything in the way of tracking.
tracking rant over my only other con is the stupid animal AI
the animals dont react to getting shot they stand still get shot then run after 2 seconds. no animation so somtimes i dont even know if the hit registered.

hunter vision sucks asssssssssssss- physically makes me sick
you have to bassicaly stand still for it to work, and then half the time it just does not work, and small gripe the hitbox for interacting with need zones is too small.

As for the actual ""hunting"" aspect, it's a pretty solid simulation. While some small game (badgers, pheasants, ducks) can be pretty clueless at times... deer, elk, moose, and bear can be quite a challenge. Don't expect to run up on anything as most creatures will run off at about 150m away from you. So you'll never get close that way. Your best bet is natural stalking, staying low, and heading into a headwind. Getting a vital hit at 150m or further is no gimmie, and you might be tracking a long ways (or worse, the animal is still alive and you keep pushing it out further.

What I like:
(1) The actual hunt, the variety of animals (w/ ranks), and the absolutely massive world to explore (it's huge)
(2) The Hunting Lodge - The customization and the amount of mounts (wall, full body), with the option of multiple animals interacting (ex. badger vs fox) is pretty spectacle
(3) Herd Management - Just like in real life, if you blast 5 deer out of a herd, dont be suprised if it takes time for that heard to repopulate.
(4) ""Some"" of the quests - some are boring, but others will get you out of your comfort zone. For example, i had a quest to get duck meat for a recipe. I mainly target big game, so this was a nice way for me to stalk some birds taking flight with a shotty

What I don't like:
One character - not a biggie, but if someone else in my household wanted to play, there is no way to create a new character. You just continue off on the main account
Lack of gear - while it provides the essentials (calls, guns, scopes), not having ground blinds, tree stands, scents, feed makes this hunting sim feel a little incomplete.
Multiplayer - Glitch/bug city right now. Will report after some updates. I'm hoping they expand on this and create some multiplayer tournament/challenges within group play. For example: Everyone is hunting, and every 20 min a random challenge appears for points (ex. take down a whitetail buck, or first to claim 3 kills). 
Key Binding Customization - For example, adjusting the scope uses the up/down keys, where I'd prefer the wheel up/down on the mouse. Cant do that. Hopefully this will resolve in a future update.

Final Verdict: 7.5 / 10
The hunting experience and lodge customization carry the weight of my rating. And being an actual hunter I may score this higher than most since I enjoy that aspect of the game which is one of the strongest pieces of the game

First bugs, the most of annoying is bad hit scanning. Im consitently getting clean hits with the right gun. There's a spurt of blood, the animal jumps, and the whole herd runs off, but when you get there there's no blood trail. At first I thought i was a bad shot, but after killing some of the same animals later on I learned the truth. About 50% of shots, specifically for mountain goat, bighorn, and bear, simply record the hit, but never go in. This not only spooks the herd and leaves you with no kill after sometimes 45 plus of trying to find animals, but ruins the trophy and sell value. This happens with about 20% of shots overall, but 50% for those three species. Less gampley affecting is constant audio glitches and visuals. Constantly hearing the sound of a pump shotgun racking, maybe once every 20 seconds when i dont have it out ect, and weapons getting stuck in between changing and having to either reload the game or change back and forth 4 or 5 times to fix it.

Next is gameplay. Animals will spook rediculously easily. for most of the map outside of the initial river valley you cant really see more than 100 yards. like 75% of the map is heavily forrested and mountainous, but animals constantly spook at 300 yards plus. Even when you see them, theres a 50% chance theyll spot you at 250 yards in a bush and sprint like a demon for 800 yards. So you spend hours looking for the type of animal you want through the maps deadzones, spend 30 minutes stalking it hoping it doesnt spook at nothing, only for a decent chance your gun shot is a dud and only spooks it off while ruining your trophy. Also the need zone system seems completely broken, theres no correlation between either location or times.",1660873304,1660873304,False,19,1,0.533517956733703613,0,True,False,False

The scenery are breathtaking. The mountains and the sense of scale is really impressive. The river is beautiful and feel fresh compared to stale lakes that we usually see.

[b]Step 1. Stalking your prey[/b]
Take out your binoculars and look in the distance. See that herd of white-tail deers drinking in the river? They're your target. you might be 400m away, but you see them and they don't see you.

[b]Step 2. Approaching silently[/b]
Running might be good when you want to cover long distance and you don't care that animals hear you. Now, you need stealth. If you walk or crouch, you have 2 speeds you can go. Normal or Slow. You can toggle it with CTRL. You can walk for a while but if you feel like long herbs are on your side, crouch into them and slowly approach your target. 150m is really great. But at 200m I would really slow down and take it really slowly. You can use your binoculars for precise distance or use your hunter sense for a rough estimate.

[b]Step 3. Lining your shots[/b]
Now, you are the predator. I hope you packed the right rifle for this kind of prey. You want to aim just behind the front shoulders, right in the creases. Make sure your scope is zeroed in near your current range to maximise accuracy. If your target is not aligned right, you might have to wait for a bit. The goal is to get a good shot at the vitals. Heart and Lungs are perfect targets and will induce the less pain for the animal.

[b]Step 4. pull the trigger[/b]
That's the moment. Hold your breath and SHOOT. Feel that? That's why this game is worth the money. that feeling when you see your target flinch, run 30m and drop. You might have to follow the blood trail for a while but the feeling when you harvest your target, it is priceless.",1660869433,1660869433,True,1,0,0.506172835826873779,0,True,False,False

Shouldn't have to spend 1/2 hour plus after initial shot to locate kill. Some kills are never found. Some blood spots are super tiny. 

Animal cans go a long ways after clean shots which doesn't seem realistic. Hard to spot kill in dense forest as you're constantly chasing blood trails in multiple directions trying to figure out where animal went. This wastes a ton of game time.

Areas of the map seem dead, with no life anywhere. Animals spook easily on normal difficulty and run away often way before you're even in range to get a shot off. Can go for a long time without seeing anything.

Hunting is fine and getting a kill then locating it is satisfying, but ultimately far too frustrating. There's no scent block and guns are limited with no pistols, bows or extra rifles. Still plan to play, but can't really recommend unless you want a slow paced hunting game.

Personally I have only experienced minor graphic glitches while entering a new zone and once the blood trail went through some trees and the blood was on a branch, elevated so I was unable to investigate it. Aside from that I've gotten stuck near trees twice which was easily fixed by crouching and standing back up. Nothing game breaking and I have a solid fps (though I'm on a fairly high spec rig). 

On 1440p the FOV has not bothered me much, then again I'm not much of an fps player. 

Now for CotW where I've clocked ~1000 hours and to compare it to Way of the Hunter (WotH in short) seems to be unfair. Both games are striving to be different from one another, while CotW is easier, easier tracking, more dense animal population and other things, WotH aims to be more realistic, on a much larger map with a lot fewer animals per square kilometer. It also has a feature where the player can and will influence the population and create a hunting paradise or vice versa. WotH also has a different need zone system to CotW where it is not guaranteed to spawn the same herd every day at the same time. 

Game is released with 2 maps and each map has its own hunting lodge to display your trophies, both maps also cover a large variety of animals from small water fowl to Moose.  

The game is fresh and barely 48 hours old at the time of writing, but it is by far not as incomplete as some reviews make it out to be.  

If you are an hunting enthusiast and wish for a more realistic hunting game, I'd most definitely recommend to give it a go, if the FOV is a big deal then wait until they have addressed it.

The ballistics, render distance 1000 yards, genetic system in this game makes you want to play more than just run and gun call of the wild.

The game just released and yes it has some bugs like any game that comes out and has mass amounts of player playing it. Things will come to the surface. 

WoTH had more people than CoTW did at launch.

I have a 5900x paired with a 2080super achieving an average of 85 FPS with some hitting 68fps and topping out at 115fps @ 1440p.

Game Breaking Mission Bug
When i started palying and reatched the hollywood mission i selled the animal and wasnt able to continue the story therfore i had to go inside the game files to tweak some files.

Fix It!

IS THE GAME FORTH IT? well ofcourse the game has ultra realistic mechanics depites the gamebreaking bugs and most likley should not been released until it was ready for release.
they have a legit team so it should be fixable.

At the time of writing the game does not allow you to rebind keyboard controls, does not allow you to change the FOV, steam cloud is not working and there are no multiple saves built into the game. The first two are soon to be fixed by a incoming patch. While none of these are game breaking it is something to note.

As for the game, wow! I have been searching for this type of game. While Call of the Wild is a great game it was always too arcade like to me. This is the opposite. This game will not hold your hand. Outside of a few story missions you will not be told where to find the animals. You need to scout, find common areas and then hunt. Animals just like real life have their guard up. You can be 200 meters away but if a strong wind is blowing your scent toward them they are going to leave. Walk a little too fast and make too much noise? They are gone. You will need to use all the elements and skills to sucessfully hunt. Even on easy this game is hard. Tracking doesn't hold you hand either. You will need to find the blood on the ground, leaves,rocks and bushes. Sometimes it will tell you where the next blood spot is and other times you will be tracking for 20 minutes. Its as realistic as hunting games get.

Not to mention the visuals. This game looks amazing. Sunsets and sunrise is some of the best I have ever seen done in a game. 

As for the steam deck. Its runs ok. You can get by with a mix of low to medium settings and it will sit at or around 30 fps. The issue really lies in the decks screen size. Hunting small game on the deck is nearly impossible",1660850053,1660850053,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you're into this sort of game just get it.

Platform:PC
Game Play Pref: hardcore - playing on 'Ranger' mode (the most difficult)
Time so far: 20+ hours

PERFORMANCE - PC: I run this on two machines one state-of-the-art circa 2016 and 2021. Both at 1080 (which looks just fine in play); the 2016 one will do it satisfactorily. The 2021 model (nVidia 3080Ti, 64G memory, AMD 5900x) blasts through it easy (with all sliders maxed too but the rig runs very warm - nature of [that] beast).

PRO
-The graphics are at  a level now where the difficulty of spotting animals is representative of the real world - lot of 'cover' 
-Sound is good quality-wise
-Best/longest visible range I've ever seen in this genre
-Animal animations and 'micro-behavior' is very good; I feel like I'm watching real deer.
-Game play is good, not great.

Con
- Game play
1) It could be named ""Big Game Rancher"" - this approach is great but the time cycle is way too fast (in fact the clock is too fast - a day passes in what, a couple of hours?); a generation of a,say, a mule deer is not measured in hours (or less, but I'm not sure of the exact game mechanics here)
2) a. Noisy animals: I've done a fair amount of hunting in the SW USA, desert, 'high' desert, and alpine (Rockies) and the deer in this 'sim' are way too noisy. Most all the animals are. However, if we're simulating a 'preserve' where your the only one that's there - or has ever been there, then perhaps it's ok? 
2) b. The noisiest animals in the woods (western USA) are, so far, not making a sound - coyotes! 
3) Easy on the Badgers - way too many of them. For the default map replace them with ground squirrels and the numbers would be closer.
4) Needs a gear slot for shooting sticks or stock-mounted bi-pod. Not a con per se just nice to have.
5) No bow hunting. I'm ok without it but it probably should be in here.
6) Even on 'Ranger' mode it's still too easy - my basic beef with most of these hunting 'sims'. But, given the un-touched/never-touched 'preserve' idea then perhaps this is fine. Just not realistic to those of us with modest means.

General suggestions/requests: What I'd like is to spend days - weeks - scouting/observing to find that gem of a buck. Feel like I've earned it. Less of an aracade. Obviously this should be an OPTION cus most people prefer more of a shooting gallery sim...er, game. It's so confusing.

Allow the dB and AI to be modded. Animal models too I suppose but that's not my talent (it is for a lot of people). Since this thing is on the PC, and not a 'throw-away' console (only) game it will have more legs if the community is allowed to extend it, generally speaking this has always held up.

I'd love to try this in VR too (I have the expensive PC to run it, barely). Not sure I'd wear the headset all the time but for the final 'stalk' it would be very immersive.

If you hit an animal anywhere other than the heart, lungs or head, it doesn't go down, and if you do, it will still run just as far and fast as a fully healthy animal. Furthermore, the  vitals area seem greatly reduced compared to reality.

Furthermore, tracking is also not realistic, which means you really have to depend on hunter sense, which is a pulsating glow that matches the light of the morning/evening sun on the grass. Why is it pulsating and why is it literally the most useless color? No idea. Devs need to provide some options there.

Finally, the game engine was a bad choice. In Hunter, Call of the wild, if you spot a deer at 400  yards, you spot a deer at 400 yards. In this game, you're lucky to see a blur, if that. I frequently see graphical artifacts that don't even remotely compare to what they actually are if you zoom in with your scope or binoculars. Dev's can fix the game play issues, but I don't imagine there is much they can do for the graphics.

I think it's really good foundation for a great hunting game.  I remember CotW on release and for the years after.  It was really buggy too.  Something I think a lot of the community has forgotten after 5 years of patches and DLC.  CotW was never what I wanted it to be.  I always wanted Classic re-skinned.  It never became that but became a more arcade version of it.  Still fun, but lacked the things I wanted.

WotH is for me what I wanted CotW to be.  The genetic systems and how herd management is done is a fabulous way of making ethical hunting more desirable.

Best hunting game since TheHunter Classic. I feel like I'm playing a modernized version of that game, but with no subscription or having to buy other things with real world money. 

I've had several crashes while fast traveling, and there are a few little bugs here and there. 

The game is mostly good. The hunting, shooting,  animals, world are all good.  Voice acting and music are ok, they get the job done. It's odd hearing a mix of American and English accents in the dialog when you're supposed to be in the USA during the story at the first ranch.  No biggie, maybe Gramps got himself a war bride over in England... 

I absolutely hate the hunter vision.  When activated, your screen gets vignetted, darkened, and the edges get this awful aberration and blur to them, that makes looking at it for very long a real pain.  On top of that, until a perk is unlocked, you have to stand still or move exceptionally slowly for it to work. Meaning you stop, wait for the vision pulse to illuminate any signs around you, if there are any, then take a few steps, stop, wait, rinse repeat.  Very tedious.    Also the signs glow yellow, which means they become extremely hard to see in patches of bright sunlight. It makes me miss the glowing red signs from theHunter.  At least we don't have to walk around holding the Hunter's Mate to register signs anymore.

My one other thing I wish they'd include, would be a way to fast travel to any point of interest, not just lodges, cabins and campsites.  With maps this huge, it would certainly make life a little less boring when you don't have to walk or drive so far.  

Competitions might be nice to have, but they'd probably wind up going the same way theHunter's did, with the sweatiest players exploiting stuff. 

If you like hunting games, and I mean proper hunting games, not animal shooting gallery games, this will be a must buy.  It might be worth waiting a month or two to see if they patch some of the initial bugs and crashing problems though.

So the core game is really fun, you could call it a more realistic version of COTW, since the game is a lot slower and feels more like an actual hunt, the way animals spook and the way they react at a shot and all those things are made really well, the graphics are awesome as well, and when you look at the kill cam, you can see the rifling of the bullet when you inspect it closely, these kinds of details are the things that make me love a game. Kind of demanding game tho, so I guess some optimization could be done. 

The things I wish they added to the coming update is a FOV slider for sure, and down the line it would be really nice with some type of option to choose different ammo types instead of just going to the storage and auto refilling whatever type of bullet the rifle is getting loaded with, would be cool with different types of hunting ammo and different grains for different animals, it would make the game even more immersive.

- Tracking is impossible, I went to the exact spot where I shot the deer, no blood anywhere. I saw the deer have animation for getting hit and it ran off looking like it got hurt. But yeah, no blood anywhere!!!
- The car is just a nope. It drives well I guess, but when you get stuck somewhere, you can't get unstuck or exit the vehicle
- I had to guess for most of the keybindings, since there's no list for them and I can't change the keybindings either
- Game is too pricey compared to what it has to offer currently 
- There's not really a way to skip the story at the beginning, you have to do each step until you can actually go to hunt and when you do get to that point, they don't give much tutorials anymore so you're basically on your own when it comes to actual hunting

The weapon design and feel. amazing. i have been shooting smaller bucks to help the genetics of the herd they were in and have watched groups of 1 star mature bucks flourish into 4 and 5 stars. Just today i shot a buck that i have watched grow from a young 1 star to a 5 star. This aging system adds a sort of gratifying feeling when you finally get that 5 star you work towards. It also adds a personal connection to that group. for instance like when i said i watched that 5 star grow, i had given him a name when he was an adult at 2 stars. i called him crook due to one of his antlers being lower than the other and it turned in more. he kept that into maturity even at 4 stars. then at 5 crook lost that antler shape and was a perfect symmetrical buck. so far ive only played the first map nez perce and it is gorgeous. i honestly can say enough praise about the game. Now it does have its fair share of bugs and performance issues which at times suck but overall doesnt affect the experience enough for me to be upset. as for the fov and keybind thing, it doesnt bother me at all. Its not a comp shooter so i dont need 90 fps or higher to do good and the keybinds are fine. i will change some things when it gets implemented but its childish to give up on the game like i have been seeing many do for such a small reason. i cant wait to see this game fleshed out after a few patches and what it will become in the future.",1660803330,1660803330,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

Could use some more variety in firearms, and I would love to see bows and crossbows but I imagine this stuff is coming in the future.

No doubt a lot of growing and improving over years to be done before it can match the amount of content offered by Avalanche Studios in this genre.

PROS:
- Beautiful scenery and foliage all round, 2022 graphics.
- A vehicle with enough to torque to climb hills.
- Great animal models and animations.
- Very realistic hunting experience, particularly on highest difficulty.
- Detailed shot/kill analysis.
- Unique mechanic of engineering the genes of the animal population through selective hunting.
- Main story/missions told with accompanying illustrations, giving more of a connection to the characters.

THINGS TO BE IMPROVED:
- FOV slider, keyboard customisation, ultra-wide support
- Character customisation or different character models for multiplayer lobbies
- Optimisation of graphics, some areas I receive 80fps whereas the starting lodge can be as low as 20fps in the morning.
- Online experience needs work, extreme desync when in another player's car and when not the host, same for animals.
- Toggle HUD button, I enjoy playing without a HUD but it would be nice to toggle wind direction with a key press.

The genre hasn't really satisfied me since Deer Hunter 4, and that was like 20 years ago. If you are into super arcadey hunting games, its probably not for you. It isn't ultra realistic or anything, but there is a level of detail you won't see anywhere else. The plan appears to be to update the game to add new features, items, species and environments over time. If this happens, the game could provide the most realistic and rewarding hunting experience ever. There are few bugs and widely desired features at launch (keybindings, FOV slider, etc), but the development team has already been open and acknowledged these items are being worked on.

Things I've experienced that I would like to see addressed:

- I'll allow there to be some benefit of doubt but I am fairly certain that I landed a clean broadside lung shot at 109 yds on a Mule deer but the blood trail bugged out and just ended. I combed through the impact zone and surrounding area in all directions but was unable to locate what should have been the 3rd blood spot, it just ends after the 2nd one.

Pros:

- Very realistic hunting and animals and sounds.
- Story isn't the best but it's nice having a story to follow.

What is getting annoying though is the ballistic performance of certain calibers in the game. Being a irl hunter and having witnessed and killed Mule deer with calibers such as the 243 and the 7mm 08 i can testify that the right bullet and good shot placements can cleanly and QUICKLY kill a mule deer at minimum 250 yards. It is easy to tell the devs missed the mark when it comes to this important realistic detail. 

After shooting a handful of bucks at 150-200 yards with the 7mm-08 and having them run 500 meters after a double lung shot really ? Then looking at the shot chart and saying that the bullet lost ALL energy after the bullet hit the first lung is ridiculous. I don't mind long track jobs if i know i made a bad shot but when your shooting a caliber that is easily required to quickly kill a deer at 200 yards and the games says otherwise is unrealistic. They should have talked to a ballistician at one of the bullet manufactures before making this game. Once again another Hunter sim game that spent to much time on the looks and the story of the game instead of the real life performances on the calibers.

The tracking feature is challenging and I like that, but when you have to track virtually every deer if you shot it over literally 100 yards really takes the fun out of it. I guess to some who do not hunt in real life this may not seem like a big deal and may enjoy the game. But to us real life hunters that play a game that says ""Hunting Simulator"" we have high standard and know what the game needs to be like.

This is NOT an arcade hunting sim. You will rarely stumble upon game without specific patterns in mind, nor can you simply go ham and shoot at everything that moves as it will sting you in the long run as herds depend on ratios to keep population balanced. 

Do not approach this as you would say with something like Call of the Wild, as animals are much easier to spook, harder to track, have harder tells/signs and will not return to the same spot unless you move to a different zone. They adhere to much stricter behavioral cycles like drinking and sleeping, so need zones are key. Memorizing their time behavior will be to your advantage. 

The trophy system is a lot more complicated too, as wiping out younger animals will damage the potential to get the best hunting trophies. It is better for you to let a 3 star young buck go rather than shoot it, as it will age and develop into a potential 5 star as it matures, just as it is a good idea to shoot a 1 star mature buck because it will likely die off for nothing. 

Every action you take has a reaction, so keep this in mind - Males for plentiful harvests, females to cull the populous. Mature animals before adults and youngsters.

- First, animals are harder to find. Not too hard, but just not sprinkled in as liberally as they are in COTW. Of you played both games for an hour, you'd likely get 3 kills in WOH vs 15 in COTW, largely because you shoot at a herd once in WOH and they will be half way to Mexico before you can take another shot.
-Second, animal behavior and animations are FAR better in this game. COTW feels like hunting anamatronic animals, ie the Chucky Cheese rat.
-Third, the areas seem more natural and immersive than COTW to me. That might be because the render distance is 2 times greater, so there is no disappearing grass and you can see your prey from very far away.

Where COTW is better is in the scope of the game (5 years old, many DLCs, inexpensive). The graphics are about equal. WOH is blurry and has some serious AA issues, but better lighting. Both games sound great.

If you are new to hunting games, I'd try COTW first since there is more content- BUT, keep this one on your radar as I think a few patches and some DLC will take WOH a long way forward. My personal rating for this would be 8 out of 10, with the funky graphical issues taking it down a notch.

The game play style is a whole lot different than Call of the Wild. This isn't a run and gun game.

I'm going to structure this into my biggest Pros and Cons. I'll start with the Cons so I can end the review on a high note as I think the developers deserve some recognition for creating a fun title.

[h1]Cons[/h1]
- I have had several cases of getting stuck in trees. This typically happens when trying to use trees for cover. I have no idea if trees actually provide cover but a number of them will cause you to get stuck with no way out. I think it may have to do with moving between standing, crouching, and going prone. Only solution I've found is to fast travel.
- Related to above is that I had an instance where I shot a deer, was stuck to a tree, had to fast travel to get unstuck. Before I fast traveled, I marked the spot I shot the deer. When I returned to the spot there was no blood, and no sign of the deer. I had shot it from 50m and watched it drop on the ground. It seems fast travel makes the downed deer disappear
- Some of the sounds are just too loud. Rivers that are slowly flowing shouldn't sound like white water rapids where you literally can't hear anything but rushing water. Lots of other sounds need adjustments too. I'd like to see the sounds adjusted to fit the environment better. 
- Tracking in early game. I was extremely frustrated in the early game with trying to track using blood from downed animals. You'd make an excellent shot from short distance on an animal, and then be unable to locate the animal because following the blood trail using the Hunter Sense was next to impossible. The color is too dim and blends into the surroundings, the highlight view distance is terrible, you can only see the highlights if you're standing still, etc. The thing is, now that I have unlocked several perks related to the hunter sense, tracking is no longer an issue the tracks appear much brighter and are visible much further away, and works while I am walking. I do think there needs to be some adjustments for new players though.
- Hunter sense reminds me of ""dead eye"" in Red Dead Redemption 2. The problem is that when using hunter sense, there is a filter that gets applied, the edges of the screen are darkened, and there is a blur effect that is enabled whether motion blur is on or off in the settings. With as much as a lot of players are going to rely on hunter sense, I want to see a lot of these effects removed. I'd rather have an icon or something telling me it's active than have a headache inducing bunch of filters. I generally play with hunter sense off most of the time and just flip it on for very short periods. 
- I think there could be a little more guidance for new players without making them go through an encyclopedia in a menu to figure the game out. There are a lot of things in the early part of the game that are going to throw off new players. I think a little more hand-holding would be nice for players that need it.

[h1]Pros[/h1]
- The environment - I've only played the American map so far but I'm really impressed with the beauty of the environment and the diversity of the terrain. Everything from grasslands, to marshes, to forests. Each area of the map presents different challenges and I find myself having to adapt my own play style to what area of the map I'm in.
- The difficulty - I'm a big fan of how difficult the game plays even of the default Adventurer difficulty. It's that challenge that keeps the game interesting for me. Knowing that there are additional difficulties that I can change to in the future to keep the game fresh is awesome.
- The animal animations are great. The animal movement looks really good. Watching a group of moose walk across some grasslands to a drink zone looked extremely realistic. You can just sit there and admire how big and lumbering the moose strides are.
- The economy. I'm so happy with the decision to make the weapons and gear affordable. No more grinding for weeks just to get enough money to buy your preferred weapons or gear. 
- The perk system is very well designed. I love the idea of perks unlocking in a way that mimics you improving your skills over time. 
- Herd management - this is something that is going to take a long time and a lot of effort to improve over time. It adds a completely new element to my PC hunting experience. Rather than just always looking to remove the largest buck from a herd, you need to consider what removing that buck does to the future genetics of the herd. Are you better off removing a 3 star mature buck or should you remove that 1 star adult with poor fitness and genetics? 
- Vehicles - Thank you for finally adding a vehicle to a hunting simulator that isn't complete crap. The vehicle is functional, can be driven relatively well on keyboard and mouse, and doesn't drive 250 mph. 
- The story is an element that has surprised me. It's actually pretty good and has a functional purpose to help you unlock areas of the map without having to pay for the expensive passes. I've enjoyed working my way through it. I know that missions and stories are everyone's thing but it's much more engaging that I was initially expecting.

Overall for me this game is a winner. I'm confident the developers will help correct a lot of the Issues from my ""Cons"" list if we all give them a little bit of time.

             If you get this game, I recommend setting the difficulty to Ranger for the most realistic hunting experience on the market. On this difficulty, animals senses are just like real life, there are no tracking ""bubbles"" to show you where the next track is or what direction the animal is moving. You have to use knowledge and follow the direction of foot tracks, direction of blood droplets, and seeing the animal to find it. There are easier difficulties which add those ""Arcade"" style tracking and hunter senses, but I prefer not to use them.

               For now, there is a small selection of rifles and shotguns. There are no bows, crossbows, muzzle loaders, or pistols. There are only 2 maps so far, but this game has the potential to put TheHunter Classic and Call of the Wild to shame.

                Graphics are great and animal physics are really well done. Except for the rare ""T-Posing"" pheasant or the pheasant that just floats into the air as it flys away.

Pros:
- Neat bullet cam, shows you the trajectory of your bullet through your quarry
- Able to taxidermy and display your hunts, or sell them for money
- Large map
- In-depth tracking (see below)

Cons:
- Game launched without key rebinding or an FOV slider
- Acting of the main character is cringe
- Forced sub-par story (I just want to hunt bruh)
- Weird blur on everything, which can make tracking difficult, as the blood and footprints blend with their surroundings even in hunter vision
- Animals at long distances (~150-200) tend to weirdly mesh and blend with their environment, especially if two overlap
- One issue I experienced personally, though have yet to see from others, the antlers of deer weren't rendering in that 150-200 range, making it impossible to tell which were male and which were female (max settings, high-end rig)
- Co-op is borderline unplayable for the majority of people

I'm really not getting the issues some folks are crying about; the tracking system is good and trails are decent to follow if you take your time using your hunter sense and make a good shot. I've only lost one buck with a bad shot, but that was because when I located the herd again to take a second shot on him, another buck stood in front of him behind the brush he was in and I wound up hitting the second deer instead of my original target. Might revisit the herd and see if he survived to have another go at him.

There can be frame stutters at higher frame rates, but I get that with most games on Unreal Engine, so it doesn't bother me much. Seen a few glitches, like Grandpa's rifle giving progress for all gun type perks, a badger gliding across the grassland with its head down, ass up, and being able to spot game through solid objects(might be a feature and not a bug, who's to say), but the game is overall well made and gorgeous to look at and roam. 

I see folks saying the rivers are too loud, but if you've ever crossed a river, they can certainly be quite noisy, so that's nothing of concern in my book. River's walking speed is a tad off-putting though; seems like the guy's powerwalking through the woods and that just screams twisted ankle to me, haha.

If I could suggest an improvement, I'd like an indicator of how concealed you are while stalking. i can't tell if brush is hiding me from an animal's view or not at this point, though crouching and staying still when the target is alerted does works more often than not to let them calm down.

This game has a LOT of potential. However, it is just missing too much and has a lot of simple problems. 5 Hours played on Coop (about a half hour to do the tutorial). 

Here is my observations!

The bad; 
1. Desync issues, performance hog, not very well optimized
2. Low FOV console game? 
3. One session we played for 3 hours and only harvested 4 animals. (2 hogs, 1 goose, 1 whitetail) 
3. No character customization 
4. Very limited gear, equipment, weapons, calls, etc. Was Honestly hoping for a bow, more varieties of guns, and different ammo types.
5. Good variety of animals, but good luck finding them! 
6. No real environmental interactions
7. The cars are too overpowered. You can damage them, but you can also basically set a way-point and drive in a straight line to your destination. 
8. No dogs, companions, or other vehicles
9. There is a variety of strange "".stuck"" issues and character animation failures 

There are some things that I think are REALLY cool and interesting about this game, however. 
Here they are; 
1. The shot calculations and ballistics are really cool! 
2. The shot play-viewer when you harvest your animal is REALLY unique and I think other games will find this as a primary competitive feature! 
3. The tutorial is paced nicely and gives the player a decent introduction to the map, the game features, and the basics. 
4. The animals calls, behaviors, animations, and sounds are given a LOT of variety and personality to them! No more hearing the same sound-byte for a animal over and over. No more expecting animals to move or react the same way every time. Expect the animals you encounter to be more lively and have more realistic and unique personality! 
5. The difficulty adjuster is well designed. The fact that it only affects your UI and the animal behavior is perfect. It doesn't seem to change how much in-game currency you earn or anything else. 
6. The game environment is really atmospheric and feels big 


Overall I would recommend this game; but people should wait to buy until changes are made and things we want are added :)",1660764901,1660765000,True,3,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False

Overall this is a really good hunting game, with some interesting unique game systems in place.  The graphics are good, and the gameplay is pretty smooth.
- Pretty graphics
- ""ammo is free"" is a nice touch
- Gun firing feels nice and smooth
- Nice diversity of wildlife
- ""Herd Health"" system is a new unique feature

Does it have some bugs and issues?  Sure!
- No FOV slider (will be fixed on first patch)
- No UWM support (will be fixed on first patch)
- No keyboard rebinding (will be fixed on first patch)
- Some inconsistencies in graphics performance (stated as a high priority)
- Small selection of weapons

From what I can tell, the review bombing is purely because of the FOV and UWM issues, which is top on their list to fix.  This is the classic ""game stinks because single issue"" thing that seems to go on with newly released games on Steam these days.

This game is remarkably stable, fun, and relatively bug free for a day one release, and has no smaller a selection of guns than COTW did when it first released.  From what I can see, it will only get better.

If you're all grumpy because of the FOV and UWM stuff, then just don't buy it yet and get it when they've fixed it in a few weeks.  Doesn't mean it's a terrible game.",1660764844,1660764844,True,4,0,0.520884513854980469,1,True,False,False

- Anti aliasing issues (only FXXA in 2022)
- No way to check the keybinding

A few interesting bugs in multiplayer that need to get fixed, but an overall enjoyable experience so far, and really good in single player.  It's new, so give it time for patches and content growth.  I own both this and the other hunting game that gets compared to it, so not new to the genre, and I'm finding some real positives in this title.

Post-shot tracking is a bit harder, but not impossible if you look around and read the tracks.  Not having a sundial on the ground showing travel is different at first, but you learn to look at the blood, see which way it's pointing, and look for the next trail in that general direction.  

The graphics are really good, sometimes breathtaking, making me stop and really appreciate the scenery.  

Seeing your prey across the map, not vanishing at 300-400 meters, is good stuff.  

Prey doesn't spook at high distance like some other titles, so I can sneak up on a shot and feel like it won't bolt at 200 meters while I'm crawling through the grass.  Flip side, sometimes the prey doesn't spook when you'd expect them to, like I'm standing 30 meters away in plain sight and they're looking right at me.  This has led to some fun moments of testing the scare limits of the wildlife. :-)

The vehicle isn't ear deafening loud like some ATV in another game.  I actually enjoy using the jeep to get around to save time.  On the other title, I tend to turn down the volume while using the quad only when absolutely necessary.

Cons:
Multiplayer needs a lot of work.  Too many bugs and missing features happening here.  We learned to work around it, but long term this needs a lot of love.

Couple of things I'm holding off saying to see if it's the game or just me adjusting to this vs the other game.  Could just be growing pains on my part.

I'd like to see in the future: Definitely more weaponry.  Archery needs to be in here for sure, especially since the wildlife isn't as timid and easily spooked.  Tree blinds and tripods, sometimes we need to overlook an area that doesn't have a wooden stand.  Definitely need multiplayer markers so friends can mark the map so we can see what they're pointing out, and friend markers staying up beyond 100m would be nice.  An increase to player count eventually; sometimes our party gets beyond 4 players.

The multiplayer animation of the other players is absolutely terrible, they just slide arond the ground, hands get stuck in animations, the binaculars got stuck inside his head and they stayed there even when he changed to a weapon. and i can't see if anyone jumps. (no animation of other players when they jump)

You can't change the time in multiplayer, why can't the host change the time?

And if anyone other then the host jumps they get stuck in a jumping loop.
The driver in a car is invisible for other players, the only thing they see is the bullets in the weapon floating in the air.

I get alot of framestutter in this game while playing. 4K Ultra on a 85"" screen at 70+ fps (i don't have that problem in other games)

Singelplayer is ok i guess. Multiplayer is a hard NO at the moment.

i realy hope they fix multiplayer fast.

EDIT:
When you get knocked unconsius then fast travle to 1 of the 4 other cabins you fall under the map you have to go back to main menu to fix it.

Animations in single player is horrible aswell, the arms keeps flailing about and get stuck in wierd positions.

In the 8 hours I've played since launch (yesterday afternoon at the time of this review), I have come across bug after bug.

Some notable bugs so far:
Prone animation - left arm floats on left side of screen (returning to even ground fixes)
Jumping into a hill or mound - character's legs get locked in a jumping animation without keypress (restart fixes it)
Fast travel - fall through map (restart fixes it)
Co-op - Desync caused me to float into the air (restart fixes it)
Single player - Animals float in the air when close to a tree (fixes when they walk away or get shot)
Elk pathing - after shooting at some Elk, they got locked into a circular pathing. They just ran around in circles and let me shoot them...

At the moment, the game and video options are lackluster and missing basic options. It feels like a Cabela game made for the Xbox 360. Graphics are actually good, but theHunter: Call of the Wild still looks and feels better.

Some things I like so far:
The ballistics report after killing an animal
Blood trails when an animal is shot
Realistic anatomy
Gun play feels really good (could use more recoil on most weapons though)
Herd management and behavior (only for big game... small game like birds and badgers aren't afraid of you and will land on you/ run up to you)
HUGE maps

Overall: with time I'm hoping this game will be as big as theHunter: Classic or even Call of the Wild, but, on release, the game as a whole just feels lackluster.

A few, there is no FOV slider though the devs have said they're adding it, there is currently no way to remap controls (devs have also addressed this and it will be added later), the audio *can* sometimes be a bit unruly but that's gotten a lot better with the day 1 patch. Lastly, there are no bows currently, though that's also been added to the list of things planned down the line. I haven't experienced this but I've heard a few people have run into crashes. This doesn't seem to be widespread but it's worth mentioning. 

But what I do get out of this is one of the more immersive, realistic hunting sims out there. There is no game that I've played that does big game, specifically deer, this well. The ballistics are detailed, I'm learning things about shot placement that other games haven't taught me, and you can get fairly creative with your placement (neck and spine shots are gnarly). The guns feel good, the scopes are very fun and actually have a lot of variety both in type and quality. The visuals are quite good, and the depth given by the aging and point systems is stellar. The game has a long way to go for sure, it's far from perfect and to be far, this is a very light recommend in its current state but what it does have is a very satisfying base to set up what I believe to be my current favorite hunting game, even in its current state. 

A couple things: first, this game requires patience and it is more niche than Call of the Wild in my opinion. Second, turn foliage down by one for what seem to be free frames. The render distance in the game is insane and I don't actually see a difference in quality between the highest and second highest foliage settings. On the highest render distance setting, big game start appearing at around 800m I believe which is helpful on a technical level for spotting.

TLDR: Read my review.

I have about 150 hours in The Hunter: Call of the Wild (TH:COTW). I am also a real life hunter and outdoorsman, though most of my time ""hunting"" is more accurately described as ""hiking a trail while holding a weapon; no animals nearby."" This game takes place in a place called the Nez Perce Valley. This is the name of an actual Native American Tribe that originally inhabited much of the pacific northwest regions of Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. Today, they have a reservation in northern Idaho. This game does a good job of capturing the general feel and aesthetic of those regions with sharp sheer mountain peeks and open terrain that you will find at around 8,000 feet of elevation.

I think this game has a solid foundation and good bones to build on. It has the clean User Interface of Sniper Ghost Warrior, driving and navigation like Far Cry 5, and scenic vistas and a map size like TH:COTW. 

If you can imagine what the base game of TH:COTW in 2017 released as, you'll have a good idea of how this game will feel. First impressions are positive, and the $40 price is justifiable. You can't compare TH:COTW in 2022 after 5 years of patches and DLC addons to this because then you're comparing a $20 game + $135 DLC ($165) to a $40 base game + $20 season pass ($60). They can both coexist and learn new mechanics to add from each other.

I'm playing it right now and enjoying it. If you like this niche genre of hunting games, you'll like it or pass on it within 30 minutes. I think TH:COTW still stands as the top hunting game on Steam. Way of the Hunter comes in right beside TH:COTW and I look forward to how the development team expand and add new content. 

There's some obvious work that needs to be done, and this game is not polished at all. I think this is healthy market competition; but at this point does not offer enough over TH:COTW to be considered a replacement. I would consider this game a supplement if you're getting burned out.

For now, I will enjoy taking in new scenery, unlocking new rifles, and trying to not to spook all the game with my footsteps.

The Inventory and the shop are simple from what I have seen and get the job done. 
However, I didn't find ammo in the shop?

Unfortunately the game is missing some very crucial aspects. 
Like others have mentioned before, there is no excuse for a game released without an FOV slider or Keybinding settings. Beta or not. It should be essential. Nobody likes to press all buttons to figure out a game. 

The fact there is already a DLC and SEASON PASS for sale makes it look even worse. Please stop releasing DLC along unfinished, unpolished games. It just looks greedy.
Your priority should be fixing issues that arise before offering additional content.

I ran into a bug where my character glitched in the reload animation. I then switched to my binoculars in the hopes that it would fix it, but the animation continued as my character tries to put bullets into the binocular.
Furthermore crouching causes the knee to come into frame and block the sight sometimes.

The animations to switch gear / weapons take too long in my opinion. Same with climbing up the ladders to the hunting stands.  Tracking down hit animals is difficult, but I guess it will get easier / quicker with spent perks.

I am willing to edit this review once the issues are fixed.",1660679890,1660754038,False,1,2,0.496151745319366455,0,True,False,False

So, i got it and i have loved every moment of the game. I get very immersed into what i play and this was a treat so far. I love the story, voice acting and pace. The graphics are stunning and the world i am in is so beautiful. The animal animations are spot on as well.

In 5 hours of gameplay alone:

Multiplayer issues:
- From animals dying standing up for one user and normally dead for another, blood tracks not showing to quite literally not seeing sh*t the other player can see. 
- The walking animation is broken and buggy for the player who is not the host.
- In the kill screen animals you have shot often show all bullets having missed if you are not the host
- Just not good enough multiplayer experience, no quests, no challenges, anything would be more than the nothing given to the multiplayer experience. 

General issues:
- Parts of the transylvania map are very buggy for wildlife traversing them and there appears to be a sloped area in which you can slide into and die even though logically it shouldnt kill you. I have a video of this tragic mess.
- Parts of your unequipped gun pop into the camera briefly when you stop moving, its unsettling.
- Animals do not seem to make noise unless startled, not sure if this is intentional design, seemed more prominent in multiplayer. General animal calls were almost non existent? 

Small QoL issues:
- No FOV or Keybindings for PC on release.
- No way to customise the colour of the hunters sense, which is annoying as it blends in sometimes with the natural colours of the map.

That said there's a lot of potential here if given the love it desperately needs in the areas i've mentioned above.",1660751366,1660751366,False,7,0,0.527824640274047852,0,True,False,False

Not an excuse but an explanation. In my book, this is what i would concider a beta, or something to be worked on over a long time, as with Call of the wild.

What is there is great. The world is expansive and feels very alive and well crafted. The animals act very real, as far as ive seen. Its immersive to hunt and the gunplay is solid. Soundscape is terrific. The Information that can be learned by simply hunting is great, you¬¥ll know when you¬¥ve done a good or bad shot because its systems will tell you, in detail, what happend, which makes it easier to actually better yourself. They have even added additional real-life facts to help people understand things like ethical hunting and such irl and i really like that. I would also want to praise the shooting specifically. Its a kin to when hitting a golfball just right, that pinging sound and then seeing it soaring towards the horizon. When you get a perfect shot, it sells the impact really well in a similar way, as you see the bullet hit just right and the animal staggers. The recoil may be a bit weak, but in the end the shots feel great. The hunting lodge has great potential to be a great place to return to between hunts. I cant speak too much on the aging/genetics and female to male ratios, but it seems awesome for hours upon hours of dynamic hunting.

Then, it¬¥s what is not there. No FOV-slider. No rebinding of controls. Jittery animation sometimes, depending on terrain. Barebones janky co-op. I have a quite a good pc-rig, and while the game does look beautiful most of the time, it lacks optimisation. I¬¥ve seen some pop-in and the textures sometimes looks muddy. It just feels half-baked. It smells and looks good, but if you look inside its gooey and still needs another half an hour in the oven. Im willing to give them time to put it back in, but it really is not ideal.

In the end, it¬¥s supposed to be a platform to be built upon. The lack of communication about the state of the game prior to launch leaves a sour taste in my mouth, but i will stick around. Since theres a lack of nuance here on steam, ill leave it with a careful recommend, know what you¬¥ll get yourself in to. It¬¥s way more oriented towards sim, so while the story teaches you the basics, you¬¥ll have to work to get good yourself. I do not regret my purchase, as i am investing in a genre i want to succeed and the large games are few and far between.",1660720942,1660735487,True,5,0,0.549180328845977783,0,True,False,False

After loading in for the first time and walking around I was joking with my friends that I'm going to drop off the kids at the ex-wife, block all my contacts, and live in this world forever, meditating under trees and in wood cabins to crackling fire. The sound effects and graphics are awesome, you're literally in a nature ASMR sim.

I don't really get the negative comments about FOV sliders. It's such an easy fix and honestly not that big a deal. I didn't even notice it on my 27"" monitor, maybe it bothers people with ultra widescreen setups but once again it's being addressed and coming hot in a patch. It's such a minor thing to get upset about.

As a hunting sim, WotH is not my first rodeo. I've got 26 hours in CotW and that might not seem like a lot, but I stopped playing because it wasn't offering the experience I wanted. I got really tired of it, playing multiplayer and hearing gunshots every second like I'm in Dorms on Customs in Escape From Tarkov and watching as online players genocide a whole species while running around with night vision goggles like they're on some kind spec ops mission as a f#### you to nature. The game was just too easy and it's not meant to be played with the hud completely off which was the experience I was actually looking for: full immersion without random glowing blue things popping up everywhere (you can turn it off, but the game wasn't meant to be played with it off so the experience is lacklustre with you always having to turn things on and off.)

RANGER difficulty (the-esports-sim-true-to-life-as-immersive-as-it-gets-only-attempt-if-you've-got-a-strong-gigachad-jawline-difficulty) on Way of the Hunter is a completely different story. It actually works well without a hud or hunter sense and offers the experience I've been craving. I was able to look at the swaying trees to determine the direction of the wind, I was able to stalk deer and pick out the strongest of the pack because of the size of his antlers and darker colour, I was able to find and follow the blood without using hunter vision because the blood actually sticks to the surface of leaves and on top of grass blades and isn't just a blob on the ground that becomes impossible to find like CotW, I could follow the blood all the way to the deer's body and it didn't even take an absurd amount of time.

I also love the emphasis on ethical hunting and not night vision stalking and eradicating an entire species. Whenever I found deer, I was asking myself this question: how can I do this ethically so that the pack still thrives in their habitat, do I go for a younger male who has bad genetic traits or do I take out an older male that looks like he doesn't have many years left. This question alone makes the hunt much more emotional, you're not just shooting the first or best thing you see because these factors are in play. You want the reserve to do well and thrive so your damn grand kids can hunt there too üòÇ

I also like the slower game play, the atmosphere, and the world. It's extremely immersive and I can't wait to see what comes next.

--THE BAD THING--
My only real gripe so far is that if I turn the hud off, I can't zero the weapon because that menu disappears so I don't know if I'm on 100m or 250m etc. so currently I leave the hud off and as soon as I know my distance to the animal I have to go ESC > Hud on > check that my gun is zero'd correctly > ESC > Hud off > take the shot. A fix or better way of doing this would be much appreciated üôèüèª

Also I got locked once and couldn't right click to aim down the sights so I had to quit to main menu and reload into the game to fix it, but luckily the deer were still in front of me because the game remembered where I was.

Pros:
+ Animal models are very good, with good animations and transitions between animations.
+ Foliage looks very good at a distance and not that bad up close.
+ Tracking animals by the blood trail is pretty interesting, the blood splatters are detailed and show the direction the animal was moving without being an arrow pointing right to them. Tree limbs will be spattered with blood if the animal brushes up against them, and tall grass will also be spattered.
+ ""Hunting Sense"" gives you the toggle-able ability to see animal tracks, spoor, need zones, blood trails, etc with a light outline. The fact that it is not on or off all the time and in an easy at-will keybind makes the game much more immersive and visually stimulating.
+ The Perks system gives you a type of progression without being tied to ""levels"".
+ Small touches. There are lots of these, far too many to go into in a quick review like this. From the blood spatters, the focus on ethical hunting, the calls and sounds of animals moving, to an extra-long-range rendering distance for animals (about twice as far as Call of the Wild).
+ Animals age! That young deer already has an impressive rack (don't giggle), but it has room to grow. So let it grow. It will become a trophy buck after a few more play sessions. Though if you don't find it again, it may die of old age. Seriously.
+ This goes hand-in-hand with the previous pro, and that is that you can essentially make trophy herds by careful selection and culling. That's an incredible level of detail in a game like this.
+ Varied calls allow you to call in the specific type of animal in a herd you're looking to hunt. Does, low-quality males, and higher-quality trophy males.

Cons:
- No FOV slider on launch - Devs have already said this is coming in the near future.
- Some people have had the game crash on them. Is this unheard-of on launch day for games?
- No way to change or alter keybinds at launch - Devs are already fixing this in the near future.
- Some controls are a bit sluggish, specifically weapon swaps.
- The visual transition to and from Hunter Sense is disorienting to some people.
- Multiplayer is unstable at launch - again, not unheard-of at launch (the game's been out for like 3 hours now) and I'd give it a week or so for them to get things much more stable.
- Weapon descriptions are pretty poor, as is information on which firearms are better for which animals at-a-glance on the shop page.
- Shotguns only have bird shot. Seriously?

- Shotguns all fire birdshot only (no slugs, no buckshot)
- No pistols, no archery (probably will be gated behind DLC)

[b]Incredible grind[/b]
- You level up by ""doing"" things. Like one of the perks requires you to crawl 7 kilometers to get it. The crawl speed is incredibly slow, maybe .3 meters a second. Someone can do the math on how many literal days worth of crawling that is.
- To hunt in areas outside of the starter area requires a ""private pass"", of which there are currently 8, and they cost 4,500 currency each. A good buck gets you around ~300 currency. Hunting small game is worthless as they only yield ~20 currency.

[b]Full of bugs;[/b]
- Downed animals disappearing as you walk up to them.
- Birds just sink straight to the bottom in bodies of water.
- Shooting an animal in the lungs at 100 yards and the animal nor the herd reacting at all; ghost bullets?
- Getting stuck in rocks and environment requiring a restart of the game.
- Crashing to desktop.
- Massive desync in co-op. Player models and animations look really wacky.

Missions are bland, bizarre and seem like they give no rewards whatsoever. The 4th or 5th mission is [spoiler]investigating a weird noise in the woods, which turns to be a tape recorder next to a radio that transmits a person screaming ""HELP ME!"" and apparently it's just some chick playing a joke on her brother or something? Really bizarre.[/spoiler]

As everyone else has said, no FoV or ultrawide support. Feels like a really bad console port. Framerate isn't very good on a near top of the line rig running at 1440p.

The relatively small Development team have done a brilliant job bringing the Pacific Northwest and Transylvania to life with some of the best animal behaviour and animation I have seen.
There are a couple of very minor visual bugs, but considering how ambitious this game is (with a population management system etc), I honestly would have expected far more on release.

- EXTREMELY resource intensive game. Despite its small hard drive size, your CPU will be able to fry an egg in no time flat.
- Data collection. This is a sore spot for me, but the game says it's anonymously collecting your performance data while you play. While it is up front about this fact and gives you a clearly marked button to turn it off, it feels like we're being asked to play this game so the devs can identify which areas need polish after release, which I'm not a fan of.
- Inaccurate hit markers. I know, I know, git gud. But I swear I landed several shots in vital areas that were not counted as vital hits, despite the hit marker being turned on and the recommended energy level achieved. In one instance I shot at what the game informed me was 213 meters. I zeroed at 200m (yes I double checked) and aimed a little high. To my everlasting joy the mule deer dropped dead on the spot, but when I went to collect the kill I discovered I'd been credited with a shot that lodged itself in the SPINE. Yes, I triple checked my zero. I'm sorry but what?
- The game punishes you for trying to engage at anything but 100 meters and for scoring anything less than a perfect shot. Even with the starter scope, I felt comfortable taking shots at 200 meters, especially at broadside targets. NOPE! You didn't get that perfect shot, no vitals for you! Good luck finding it after it has run away for around 200 meters or more. Call of the Wild lets me take accurate and devastating shots at 350 meters, with a reasonable chance of a kill confirmed. To be penalized for taking shots at a little over half that distance with a grueling chase because of questionable hit calculations is too much.
- Hunter Sense. Yes, the game gives you a shiny gold marker that flashes radiating around from the player. A shiny gold marker... on shiny gold grass... under the shiny gold ball we call the sun. There's a reason Call of the Wild uses blue and white, I'm just saying. Tracks also inexplicably disappear for no reason. I had at least one trail just... end. No kill, just... no more trail, and no animal. I may have missed it, but I spent a good ten minutes looking for a trail that should not have been more than ten meters away and never found the next part.
- Hunter sense audio also simply doesn't work. For some reason you can hear a mule deer chewing at 200 meters or a pheasant's footstep at 150, but at 100 meters or less (or after several enters/exits of hunter sense), the game just stops giving you audio indicators. You're pretty much forced to guess your distance to target and hope you get eyes on before they hear you.

One positive which is greatly appreciated is the ability to drop a pin exactly where your bullet will impact. Very useful right before you shoot because it pretty much guarantees you'll be able to find the start of the blood trail. It's features like that that give me hope that after a few months of love from the devs this game could eventually be a Call of the Wild killer.

Overall, this game was NOT ready for release and should have been delayed. I beg you all to wait for the devs to do the work that needs to be done polishing this before purchase, and do NOT pay full priced for an unfinished game.

Steam's refund policy gives us all two hours to try a game, which frankly means the devs have two hours to impress us, and in this case as far as I'm concerned they've failed. I may try again in two months, with a discounted price.",1660721383,1660722565,False,17,0,0.491726458072662354,0,True,False,False

- At 3 hours in I have had a lot of fun and really enjoyed the hunting experience and it feels like every animal I harvested were memorable.
- The animal behaviours are incredible. As a real life hunter, the animals in this game appear so life-like and close to the real thing in terms of their animations, movement patterns, reactions to the player and other animals, reactions when shot etc.
- The world is massive, beautiful and immersive. Some sounds need to be turned down, like water sounds, but other than that, they've nailed the ambiance.
- Graphics are really nice and it runs very well on my 1070ti. There are moments of frame drops or a bit of pop-in, but it's mostly when driving the vehicle which isn't too annoying.
- Render distance is 800m!! It's awesome being able to look down these far valleys and spot animals going about their business almost a km away.
- Weapons look and feel really nice. I love the scopes reticles.
- Blood trails are amazing with blood realistically smearing on plants, long grass and other objects as the animal passes by.
- Finding downed animals are a challenge and realistic. You have to follow the blood trail all the way to the downed animal. One whitetail I shot ran through a river as it changed direction, so was quite a challenge to find, but when I did it felt like an accomplishment in itself.
- I like how the hunter sense is implemented with only bombarding you with audio queues and other animal signs when activated with settings configure it to your heart's content.
- Bullet physics and ballistics have been realistically implemented with bullet drop and wind affecting bullets which makes for an even more realistic experience.
- The harvest screen is brilliant. There is a bullet cam that shows you the exact impact your bullets had on impact of the animal. It even saves this in your harvest log so you can admire past shots of all the animals you've shot. Also there are other detailed information on the hunt.
- Animals age! If you see a 2 star young animal, chances are in a few hours that animal will grow up to a 4 or 5 star or even die off if it doesn't get harvested in time. That means new young animals are spawning in as well.
- There is a genetics system where a herd with low quality genetics will spawn animals with bad genetics. So, to increase your genetics and get better quality animals and trophies, you have to hunt the bad genetics animals from your herds. A very cool system and really fun to hunt with those goals and to see the effects.
- There are lodges with spaces to mount taxidermied animals including multi-mounts.
- There are plenty of animal species including birds. The bird species are also done really well and I've enjoyed hunting some of them.
- There is a vehicle to make travelling a bit easier as the map is massive. Driving it feels good enough for a game where driving is not the focus.
- The time it takes for the game to load is fairly short which is nice (installed on an SSD).
- The story/non-story missions are fun and adds interesting and fun challenges.
- I'm pretty sure I've forgotten a bunch of things that add to this list of things that makes this game really good and fun.

The game has it's faults, but they're issues that can be fixed, and from the feedback from the devs, quite soon. So maybe if any of the issues listed below are a massive issue for you, then wait a little while for some patches before buying:
- I've had 2 crashes where I was forced to restart the game. Upon restart everything worked again.
- FOV and keybinds obviously which is coming in due time.
- Framerate drops and pop-in. It's not very bad, but would be nice if it was improved.
- Co-op which I haven't tried since I've heard that it's a bit of a mess. That isn't a deal breaker for me as I usually play these kind of games by myself.

Lastly I'd like to mention that this game is more of a hunting simulator and might not appeal to the casual type gamer. I LOVE that it is a simulator and a challenge. With that said, there are difficulty settings, and the easiest setting might be good enough for the casual gamer to be able to have fun. 

As of right now this game has mixed reviews, but I can guarantee that in a couple of months it will turn to very positive when the issues have been fixed.

There is very little key control usage in a Hunting game in the first place. You are NOT tossing grenades, changing rate of fire, or even changing ammo type. This SIMULATION has TWO basic control keys, besides the WASD movement keys. They are ""C"" to crouch or go prone and ""E"" to open doors or enter a vehicle. The Scope ZOOMS with the Mouse Wheel, the Scope range can be zero'd in with the Arrow Keys and you use the basic Left Shift to toggle run (which you RARELY use anyway because it's not advised or useful to run very often).

Stunning Graphics, Sound is ""just fine"", animal animations seem to be very well and realistically done and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this because, in my view, it is the BEST HUNTING GAME/SIMULATION out and I've owned and played them ALL.

First off the game is very different from theHunter COTW because WOTH (Way of The Hunter) focuses a lot on realism whilst COTW is more of a arcade hunting game. as a hunter myself I have experience in the field and I can say for sure this is almost exactly like it.

 Second the release of the game doesn't feature a FOV option or a rebind for keys on PC but the devs said they were working on it. I don't know why people are freaking out so much about it when it's clearly on it's way besides, after a bit you get used to the FOV. 

Anyways It is a AAA game and normally needs time for the devs to find bugs and even fix things. personally i already love the game it's a bit more complicated then COTW but overall if you like realistic hunting games get this it's worth the price it. plus it Only features 2 map dlc's but the base game features a lot of animals to hunt unlike cotw where you would have to buy 2-3 map dlcs to get the number of animals you get in a single WOTH map- 8/10--> for now.",1660717682,1660717682,True,5,1,0.5,0,True,False,False

Graphics aren't everything, but in a hunting game where it's just you and the environment, having bad lighting and low res, blurry textures all over isn't good enough when other games exist that do the environment many times better. 

At launch it is lacking a FOV slider, and the FOV is set incredibly low. It makes it quite uncomfortable to play for me. There is also no way to rebind keys, which is honestly just absurd.

So far its way better than COTW in my opinion, and im not saying that lightly. There are some launch issues like a couple crashes and bugs but its better than most launches tbh and im assuming most of these will be fixed next patch. Anyways, on to why I love it.

ITS REALISTIC. Animals have different hit animations based on where you hit them. There are real time ballistics and a velocity chart that explains exactly how your bullet is performing vs certain body parts and organs and at which points it slows down. Animals age, die, have babies, and pass on their genetics so there is a benefit to culling bad bucks and leaving larger ones alive to breed. Animals also detect you better vs other hunting games and hunts feel alot more authentic.

Tracking/animal deaths and behavior are very realistic. I am a hunter in real life so I really love these details. In this game I lung shot a doe mule deer, watched her run about 200 yards then lay down under a tree. I assumed she was dead and ran up to her and to my surprise she got up and ran another 150 yards before expiring. Another time I shot a buck and grazed its spine right above the lungs and he humped up, then ran around in a circle for about 5 seconds before falling over. I have seen deer do this when hit there in real life so I really was blown away.

The animals look good. Their legs are a bit... veiny and muscly but other than that they are acceptable. The whitetails in COTW look like deranged stuffed animals which always bothered me so its refreshing to have decent looking deer.

The glowing stuff/hunter assistance isnt too much. Tracks barely glow and only when you go into hunter/focus mode, and tracking blood trails is not easy, but still very possible. you can also leave waypoints at each blood splat you find manually to make a trail in your gps. I personally enjoy the entire forest not being lit up neon colors like in cotw ruining my immersion. There are also difficulty settings you can set to remove the glowing entirely if you wish for a more challenging hunt.

Need zones are alot more in depth. Every herd has many need zones for each thing and some are used lightly and others heavily, so animals wont always be in the same places, and you dont just camp water sources to farm animals. Every hunt is a bit different and meaningful. 

I havent played too much so I will update as I get more hours, but so far im loving what im seeing. So many of these things are things cotw could have updated and done but instead they just chose to add tons of dlc for you to purchase, and so in my opinion this game is going to come out on top.

Gives me TheHunter: Classic vibes only with mega upgrading. That is the kind of player this game is for. WotH isn't arcadie and easy like CotW.

More realistic animal behaviour, bigger maps, emphasis on shot placement and ethics, and you stay wherever you quit the game! No more restarting at lodges! Thank god.

Now, to me, the game isn't particularly hard but I am currently playing on the easiest mode to learn the basics. However, another great thing is you can  adjust the difficulty to suite your play style.

There are some QoL things they need to add, like colour-blind options, FOV (apparently that is a big deal for people), UW support, keybinding options but they are working towards implementing these in the early patches.

 Personally, the controls weren't uncomfortable, it's as simple as taking your hand off the mouse for 1-2 seconds to zero your rifle ( in a game where patience is a pretty good thing to have that shouldn't be a problem ) 
FOV on a 1920x1080 res was just fine. 
 This game offers a lot of things that CoTW doesn't and can really give it a run for its money in the future. We all remember a time people whose youtube careers that were made by CoTW stopped playing because it was so horribly broken, and as for the CO-OP animations being buggy. Thats a recurring thing in all client side based multiplayer sessions ( including CoTW ) Anyway, enough comparison. This game is unique in a few ways, the Harvest screen is detailed and easy to read, anyone who enjoys hunting irl will enjoy this game. The roadmap also looks promising. solid 8/10 in my book, looking forward to the few small improvements. Happy Huntin'",1660704155,1660704155,True,27,1,0.609169304370880127,1,True,False,False

A lot of these negative reviews are comedically nit-picky.

Pros:

- NO MICROTRANSACTIONS

- No cost for ammunition or changing time. 

- Great graphics and great draw distance. 

- Animal behavior is believable and immersive.

- Progression system is simple and intuitive. 

- Weather effects are really well done. 

- Adjustable levels of difficulty control animal behavior and HUD info. 

- Harvest screen is engaging and detailed. 

- Customizable map icons. 

- Every inch of the maps feels intentionally carved out and tailor made.

- You can't rebind keys or see what the command list is.

People are trying to compare this to COTW and in my opinion you cant. This is more of a slow pace simulator hunt forcing you to be quiet to get in close.

The game could use some work in performance and chunk loading, the recoil and gun sounds could use a bit of a tweak, would love more options in the store, character customization or outfits would be cool, a 3rd person camera mode that isn't the picture camera, and a key to move head without turning body.

I personally like the objective based gameplay/story as more of a reason to be doing the hunting but if you don't care for that you can totally ignore it, the game actually encourages you to do so if you like. The fast travel system is cool because you have to explore and find those locations, and the Jeep is great to get around quickly, but don't worry your still gonna be walking around a lot. I like the fast travel and jeep because they are tools that respect my limited time; for those that want the full experience, just don't use those tools.

The game unlocks things as you go, I wasn't aware of difficulties until I progressed a bit further, probably after 2 hours or so. I've increased it to Hunter as I found the default Adventurer a little to easy; kind of, it's not easy but I'm not entirely new to this either.

It's different than Hunter: Call of the Wild; I wouldn't say better, I think that game looks better overall, but where this one shines is that the animals you hunt actually exist at all times. In COTW, I'm pretty sure the animals kind of just spawn in and disappear and such, it's almost like walking around rolling dice. This is totally not like that, these animals persist and move around and you can track them and watch it all happen. They are even saved when you leave the game which is outstanding, persistence is one of the top features this game has, it feels real because of it.

I also like the trophy system and the bullet trajectory; this helps a lot with learning how to line up a shot and where you really want to shoot the animal to bring it down quickly. I also really like that rather than tracking an animal you shot but didn't bring down immediately, you can track it from a distance to see where it falls but you have to be aware enough to actually go find the downed animal, it feels real and not like your hand is being held.

There's more to it than this as I've only just started but just ignore the naysayers, if you like hunting games and aren't out to nitpick it to death, you really ought to like and appreciate this game.",1660701484,1660701484,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

No FOV
No keyboard layout screen or controls customization.
The ballistics on scopes seem to favor high and right of the reticle. I'm adding this as I'm not the only one missing like this often. Two other friends have been as well.
I bought a deer caller that has three modes on the shop screen, but in actuality it seems to have only one mode right now. Mouse wheel Up/Down changes it according to the UI but this is not the case. My friend plugged in his Xbox pad which in the menu scheme says D-pad Left/Right but the in-game UI says Dpad Up/Dwn. Doesn't matter because neither worked. I think the the other modes are not implemented yet.
Gun selection is pretty small right now.
Ammo is only default of that caliber. All shotguns are only in birdshot. You get ammo for free when you use the storage locker. You don't have to purchase it. (I haven't tried all the difficulties yet so maybe that changes?)
Four or Five lodges per map (one is free on the base map). Maps look good and seem very well done. No tripping on ladybugs or somewhat large fallen logs here.
Subjective but... I also think the character movement is rather poor but it is on par with most games. I'm just very used to Tarkov/Arma type games that are implementing much better movement systems for just walk, crouch, lean, etc. Would like to see that implementation.

I know the devs have already replied on other reviews here addressing upcoming patches that will implement some of the missing features. However, that is not the state the game is currently in and thus I can not recommend the title. I hate to see that this title is getting sent far into the negative but this is again in a BETA state of development (in general) for the PC port. If they held off the release until the basic PC port features were in the build, I'm sure it would have done better on reviews like it deserves.

Yes there is a few bugs but this is day 1, COTW has several bugs too and that's been out 5 years now. DLC after DLC all while the bugs remain.

The Devs are super passionate and you can see all the hard work that's gone into this. The animals behave naturally imo, the perk system is fantastic and the game just feels absolutely right to me.

No fast traveling to need zones, popping off a few animals and fast travel again. This is a true open world hunting SIMULATION and NOT an arcade game.

The design is super clean I know I will enjoy this for years to come. I just hope the Devs stick by it, just emagine how awesome this will be in 5 years from now.

I really appreciate the hard work the Devs have clearly put into this. I have found my new hunting SIM!

The Already Mentioned Negatives:
Most of the negative reviews ive read are not exactly about the game but more about the menu/options/or hardware requirements. Personally in 2022 i dont think the hardware requirements are sufficiently demanding to warrant review bombing! Quite clearly states on the store page what is minimum and what is recommended. If you cant manage them, dont get it.
Menu options I agree may need additions, mainly key bindings for me, but again, it really doesn't warrant a negative review on day 1
FOV is being addressed although i got used to it within 5 minutes of playing so not really sure what the big issue is

Actual issues ive faced (these arent game breaking):
- Multiplayer needs attention - quite obviously needs work so play solo for now. 
- Wolves can look buggy and teleport when running as a pack (happened twice)
- Pheasant/Duck get caught in walking instead of flying when in the air (happened twice)
- Fast travel to more locations would be a nice QoL addition (the travelling aspect for missions can be frustrating, especially the book mission)
- Wildfowl could use some tweaking as their flight lines can be a bit sketchy

Positives:
-Pretty much everything else.

Key things you should know before you buy.

This isnt an arcade hunting game. If you expect to jump into a cabella's type operation-wolf shoot em up with deer instead of infantry then please look elsewhere. And for those too young to know either Cabellas or Operation Wolf, google is your friend !!

This is a very well put together hunting simulation from what ive seen so far. Theres no target outlinings or blood spatter trail outlining like what you would see in Hunter: COTW and this adds to the realism. Expect to spend some serious time hunting down a wounded animal if you make a bad shot. 
If you are purely managing populations taking out the weak bucks/stags, i suggest head shooting as you can get 2 or 3 killed before the herd runs - which is actually realistic as you are there to manage not trophy hunt.


- Graphically its nice and the map is pretty huge without any loading gates.
- Officially licensed weapons/gear is a real positive 
- Missions can be a bit dull but then the Hunter:COTW missions didnt interest me one bit either
- Audio is amazing; having worked in the hunting industry they have absolutely nailed the ambience of the pheasants for example, both on the ground and when alarm calling. Adds to the overall atmosphere and you can actually track the animals through their calling.
- Population management is a really nice addition, im stilling testing out certain aspects of it. Its more true to life than the random grinding of COTW.
- I like the perk system in that you have to achieve things to unlock rather than just kill kill kill
- Really looking forward to when Multiplayer is polished

Key Moment So Far:
Whilst stalking into within 100 metres of a herd of 8 or 9 white tail, a fox crosses the road in front of me and sits under a bush and stares at me. Whilst this is happening a badger watches me from the other side of a river. All this whilst hearing Pheasants in the wood next to me. Choice's choices choices.....

Bottom Line:
If you aint a hunting enthusiast, best avoid it for now - maybe pick it up on a flash sale. 
If you hunt or love realistic hunting games, get this game and support its creators. Its an improvement on COTW from what ive seen so far. Animations look amazing and are far more realistic. Especially shot placement reaction.",1660692929,1660692929,True,5,0,0.464731961488723755,0,True,False,False

I get what the developers are trying to do here and for the most part I like it.   The biggest down side with the game is the Hunter Sense and the Tracking along with the FOV!!!!  

The Hunter Sense makes you feel like you eye sight has failed and you need glasses, you can get bad motion sickness with the hunter sense the field of vision and the fact you cannot comfortably follow the tracks as they are not highlighted  appropriately for average player.  I reckon hunting in real life would be easier and I am playing on Easy mode lol!

The tracking is what you spend your time doing as the tracks are really hard to follow.  Apart from that I like the game.

What I would like to see:

.  New approach to hunter Sense / you need to see the tracks easier without the hunter sense and maybe make the contrast greater between daylight and the hunter sense and make the track flashes much more often as they are slow at the moment and there is no flow to the players ability to track.  A double lung kill needs much more blood.  The better the shot the easier it should be to follow.

.  On easier modes the tracking needs a wee direction help so you can piece together the track the animal has taken
.  Key Binding would be a great benefit
.  Could do with tents or more fast travel points

Positives:

.  Absolutely love the gun sounds and the way the gun comes off the shoulder
.  Graphics are nice
.  Love the jeep option
.  Like the concept of hunting to order
.  Map is massive

I really do want this game to succeed as I will play it a ton if the tracking gets improved.

- 2 maps with nice graphics
- ""Skill Tree"" you have to grind
- bullet animation is a really cool feature
- Hunting rating system
- User/Beginner friendly (Distance Calculator etc.)
- Sounddesign & Weaponfeeling

Cons (mostly Multiplayer)
The Multiplayer worked (more or less) for the first hour but after that there were multiple bugs and lags.
- Weird sprint bug which makes you kinda sick because of the fast wiggle while walking
- Extreme lags for the Client including the car bugging
- Sound bugs (either no sound or it sounds like your mate is 300feet away)
- Insane slow down state after pressing Ctrl/Q which can only break free with sprinting (or I missed something?)

Early days, but I like what I've seen so far and have enjoyed playing the early missions and getting the first kills in (in addition to the mission kills). I'm sure I'll be spending a lot of time on this game.
Still to see if I like the speed at which animals grow - initial impression (from watching the early access footage) is that it is too quick - hopefully we will get to understand it more but I would prefer it if the growth was over a longer period than it currently appears to be.
The Hunter Sense could do with a tweak (the tunnel vision/blurring is sometimes dizzying and I'd prefer it if that could be dialled down a bit - unless there is a setting already that I just haven't discovered yet), but generally like the fact that the sense displays the rich information without having to click a button.
I'd like to think that there is more than the 5 star animals (purely because they appear to be almost guaranteed) and I hope there will be rare fur/plumage variations and atypicals when it comes to antlers and horns.
Given the size of the map, it would be good to be able to load out with more ammunition (great that it is free!) - having to head back to the jeep or fast travelling to a base is not what you want when miles from either. It would be great to have the ability to make camp at any location and the ability to place hunting stands/blinds/tree stands (probably because I'm used to it from COTW, but also, again, due to the size of the map).",1660688964,1660688964,True,4,0,0.542682945728302002,0,True,False,False

The FOV was clearly designed around the assumption that you would be playing on a TV and sitting on your couch with a controller.  The keybinds are...strange.  To zero your scope you have to use the arrow keys on the keyboard.  The arrow keys!  Which means you have to take your right hand off the mouse, the thing you use for aiming your gun, to zero your scope.  What on Earth?  The menu system uses Shift and Ctrl to move right and left through the tabs.  Seriously?  It's like they were using the left and right bumpers on a controller and were just like, eh, Shift and Ctrl.  That makes sense.  Furthermore, there is some really wacky antialiasing going on here.  I'm playing in 4k and it is blurry.  I'm not even sure its actually running at 4k at all.

Awesome, simply put this game is awesome the devs did a remarkable job.
Nice to get that buck fever feeling when you find a mature 4-5 star animal it is just plain awesome, something modern hunting games have been missing for quite some time. I'm sorry but having to gun down 2-3000 animals in a game just to get a animal with a preset rack is just flat annoying... ya'll know what I'm talking about.
so all the pros aside this game needs bows (they're already confirmed for a later DLC) not a problem I can wait. Placeable structures like tree stands and blinds would be nice especially when we finally get bows but for now the static blinds and towers are great. cover scents, spray attractants and bait sites or feeders would also be very welcome additions to what is already a outstanding Hunting sim.

Avalanche's game has been fundamentally broken since launch and they just release DLC after DLC on top of it, this appears to completely dethrone that game and make some incredible improvements along the way.

Passive animal behaviors are interesting and realistic
Wide range of animals to hunt on day 1
Engaging and sensible progression system: get better at things the more you do them
Ballistics are accurately modeled and are a fundamental component of gameplay
Genetics ecosystem which rewards you for culling less fit animals and thinning overpopulations
Complex needs system and animal travel routines
Graphics are brilliant, performance is very good.
Detailed shot replay system displaying projectile path in a 3D model with a chart showing bullet velocity as it makes its way through various organs
Wide range of weapons and attachments available on day 1
Access to a jeep that you can drive included in the game's purchase, unlike Call of the Wild which makes you buy access to an ATV with a microtransaction.
Real brand names and products, not made up mumbo-jumbo weapons and attachments.
Responsive and fair animal behavior in response to player movement and concealment unlike another game in which it's completely unpredictable at times.
Multiple difficulty levels to get the kind of gameplay that you want.
Probably several other big features that I'm forgetting to mention. All around this is a Call of the Wild killer for me.

And something I wasn't expecting: An engaging and interesting backstory. They went out of their way to make the world realistic and human. Every little detail is like a teabag on the face of Call of the Wild's forced poorly written political nonsense. For example (spoiler alert) when reviewing emails at the start of the game you find out how your grandfather became sick. A friend warned him that Mule Deer meat was getting people incredibly sick and your grandfather calls him a conspiracy theorist and dismisses the warning. You also find that your family tried to dissuade your grandfather from getting you involved in his world suggesting that the player had a comfortable life in LA. Absolutely brilliant, all of it.

The game is honestly fantastic in many ways.

The graphics are beautiful, the weapons look so slick, and they've somehow managed to squeeze in an interesting story line. This is the first hunting game that's really hit home for me on the immersion scale. The animals and their animations look good, and the bullet camera is a well needed addition to these games.

It is also not fantastic in some ways. I agree, with what seems like more than a few reviewers on here, that there are some key binding options and sliders missing here and there. Honestly?

And even though I have rated this as positive for the review because I feel there's enough good here not to warrant a negative one, take it with a grain of salt that it's also wishful thinking for this being a better game. But at the time of writing I will say that my verdict is mixed bag for this one.

Now with that out of the way, I will give first tell you what I find to be the good/eh/bad in the game so far.

First of all, the game's visuals overall looks really good, in some areas the detail is mind blowing. however I strongly recommend you set foliage to low and TAA if possible with your specs. This is because with how the game draws loads of foliage, you get this really grainy look that can be very hard to look at, especially when on a vehicle. As a matter of fact try playing with everything else on medium settings first since I've found my game having stutter problems on a GTX 1650

Second is the gameplay, even though it's not the most engaging video game you'll find (It's a hunting game after all), you have a very decent set of mechanics that can be turned on or off depending on difficulty, which can be a plus for appealing to everyone's type of play. The progression is pretty standard in terms of how it works, but that's fine for a game like this. The controls however need to be addressed as without any keybindings to change, there really isn't a solid way to know about going prone or how pacing works. Another issue arose when hunting pheasants, the only way to really hit them is on the ground, I've tried flushing them numerous times and lined the bead up, but it always misses, same with trying to adjust it to where it might land (Which isn't that relevant as I was aiming from 30 meters away, not a long distance) so that I think should be fixed if it can.

Third would be the immersion, it's top notch in some cases with how serene it can all be, except for the part where you look to your right and the river suddenly just disappears. And even though it's not exactly an immersion issue, I would like to see some more out of animal populations, not the genetics and such, I just mean having lone deer or other game out in the forest foraging rather than everything being in a herd, plenty of game in real life wander alone away from other herds, something minor like this would help make the forests feel more like an ecosystem this way.

I give this game a solid 6/10 when it comes to everything about it, it's a good 8.5/10 as a game when it works, but with the lack of basic features at launch and with several performance issues along with bugs, it's gonna stay at an ""ok"" for now.",1660684114,1660684114,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

There is even a nice storyline in a comic style. Also its more accessible and tweakable due to difficulty settings then COTW. 

If you played COTW before and liked that I recommend to switch to Hunter difficulty right away otherwise the animals might seem too hard to spook. This will still give you the option to have highlighted tracks and such but the animals will be a lot more aware of you. Also there is a complete hardcore mode (forgot the name of the setting) which does not allow any assists.

Yeah, there are some kinks that need tweaking, but overall it's a very solid hunting simulator. I would even go as far as to say that the sense of immersion, attention to detail and overall realism on display here, beat out 'The Hunter: Call of the Wild' hands down. I think the $40 price-tag is within reason, and if you enjoy hunting and stealth simulation games, then you'll likely really enjoy this one. In my opinion, although TH:COTW is way more 'arcade-like' than this game, it will probably retain it's title as the top hunting game on Steam for now, but that is largely due to more than 5 years of constant updates, patches and 100's of dollars in DLC. Way of the Hunter can't quite compete with that kind of legacy just yet. Regardless, taken as a starting platform and more in the vein of an actual hunting simulator, it outshines it's competitor. The campaign, although kinda low-key, feels very believable, almost as if you're playing through a Discovery Channel documentary.

The game itself so far is great. It feels different enough from COTW (which I have 200hrs in) to feel like a new experience. It is slower and requires more patience. The maps are beautiful, the blood tracking is excellent, and the animals look and behave realistically. The shot tracking and ballistic data is fun and something that I will miss when I play COTW now. I haven't encountered any serious bugs or performance issues yet, but have not played multiplayer so will not comment on that.

Is it a bummer that the FOV and controls are locked right now? Sure. Does it mean that game is bad or otherwise ""unplayable""? Absolutely not. It also certainly does not mean that the developers are scum or don't care. These things will be addressed and implemented, and when they are the game will be even better than it already is.

while this game has potential its so far beyond not ready there are people defending it for reasons i don't really understand but the game is broken and unfinished so wont be refunding just waiting 

*important* : the DLC DOES NOT ADD ANYTHING Half of the map is locked away behind a pay wall this is really scummy

why do we have to settle for buggy releases that are barely functional when did this become the norm? remember when you would just get a game then at some point you'd get a patch for it in maybe 6 months to fix bugs that affected a small amount of people 

this game is much more of a sim than call of the wild is however it needs a better tracking system i applaud the developers for trying to make it realistic but realistic doesn't work in a video game because irl you can follow a blood trail easily enough and find fur on branches if you clip a deer its pretty much gone and game are running off when they really shouldn't be im an experienced hunter IRL and i'm kind of sick of games just letting your game run off because you didn't directly hit the heart animals tend to run for a short distance then sit down as their organs bleed out and their lungs fill with blood they don't run a marathon 

the game also realistically shows where animals are via distant branch snapping or calls and the animals behave realistically they don't sprint away as soon as they see you they stop and watch you then go back to what they were doing if you don't pose a threat (unless you have been actively harrassing them then they will keep fleeing) 

i also applaud the enviromental message of the game hunting is important for many regions in the world for example in Australia hunting is vital as there are no natural predators and a lot of enviromental damage is done by just letting them eat to death

-gfx glitches because they want to play a modern game on a 2005 potato.

-Awesome gfx if your PC has the capabilities.
-More realistic interactions. (You dont spook a deer half a mile away like another)
-Animal animations, & personalities match wild types a lot more than most hunting games.

Very Realistic The Devs did such an amazing job. This is literally the best hunting game I have ever owned and Played. This beats COTW 1 million times. TRUST ME!! I also am averaging 75fps and I am running my settings on High and Ultra.  The blood trails/tracking after the shot is so cool too. I had to mark last known blood on my map and then continue to search and place new marker everytime I saw new blood. I have experienced no bugs so far (I have only played for 3 hours). The story behind this game is very unique and it really touches home. Hunting is about family and traditions, this game does exactly that. Plus it has actual license equipment from guns, calls, optics ect. Currently as of 8/16/2022 there is no archery, however the Devs do have a DLC for Archery that will be dropping in the future. I can not wait to get that and do some bow hunting. I would give this game a 10/10 but I need to be realistic so I would score this game a 9/10. I also was playing with my xbox controller which made this even more fun all the controls were preset and very  easy to learn with ZERO problems. The 1 and only downfall I have noticed so far was hunting small game like birds, it is extremely difficult to shoot a duck while it was flying.  I did like the difficulty on the ducks. So if the Devs could add a clay pigeon course at the Range to get practice for shooting that would be huge. Other than that I would not change anything about this game.

Pros:
- Graphics were nice.
- Animals were nice to look at.
- Gun scope up was good.
- Had to sight the gun in for distances ( Cool Feature )
- Binoculars had rang finder ( Cool feature )
- Nice Jeep type of vehicle. 
- Sounds were nice
That's about it. 

CONS:
- CANT BIND YOUR OWN KEYS
- MADE basically  FOR CONSOLE CONTROLLER 
-Horrible FOV - Favors Console- Cant change.
- Bad Speeds walk/run
- Horrible Tracking system... I mean REALLLLLY BAD
- Hunting Rifle and shotgun. That's it.
-No scent blocker 
- Though you adjust your scope, Shooting is very(  randomly off? )

Coming from COTW the game is very familiar as WOTH copies a lot of the established systems. the guns feel good and sound great comparatively, and the gameplay is a lot less jank and floaty. animals move a lot more fluidly and actually look quite good when they do. maps look great as is par for the course by now. ultimately COTW has more going on in a game sense but this feels much more solid to actually play and appeals to people more interested in immersion and a sim style experience.

Among the new additions are private properties which you can unlock through quests or purchasing a permit and are apparently a major thing, these areas apparently have a higher concentration of animals with good genetics and so a higher chance of a good trophy rating animal. Hunter sense is also changed a bit, you arent autopiloted towards an animal or a kill as hard and will now be paying more attention the the track itself, its also possible to actually track things without it though hard.

This game requires time and dedication. You can't just run up on every animal and shoot them. They will see you, smell you and hear you before you will see them.

Its not Roll up in your jeep and blast 15 deer with your AR-15 which is what you do in Call of the wild.

Overall, the game does run good. Graphics are pretty good (Not as good as call of the wild though). They need to implement the FOV slider, which is what they're currently working on. Same with the keybindings. 

The best part of this game is the tracking and ballistics. You need to account for distance, wind, brush and bullet drop. When you shoot a animal, you also need to make sure you hit it in a fatal area. Unlike call of the wild, simply shooting the animal doesn't mean you will get a kill.

The game is really good. I'm only an hour in and I can already tell the mechanics are far superior and more logical to those found in The Hunter Call of the Wild: 

--a vehicle is included in the base game for free
--go to sleep/pass time for free
--realistic and sensible ranging/zeroing system on scopes 
--animal behavior is more lifelike and dynamic (less robotic)
--inventory management makes more sense
--the GUI in general is a lot better
--no annoying constant voice-over narrative 
--the game lets you approach objectives as you see fit and doesn't ""hand-hold""
--world exploration is organic
--fast travel system
--tracking and hunting in general is more realistic 
--real-life product brands such as Remington

These are just some things I've noticed after only an hour. From what I've observed, the devs actually care about making a quality hunting game that respects authenticity. Many of the things included in the base game probably would've been DLC in CotW. So I can tell the devs care about their community as well. If you like hunting games, I strongly recommend Way of the Hunter.

* First Impression matter and the developers in this case chose to incorporate a strange plot line with amateur voice acting in what strives to be a simple yet semi-realistic hunting sim. The lack of QoL features that have become standard in gaming, such as an adjustable FOV and the ability to rebind keys makes general gameplay very difficult to enjoy. There is also a noticeable lack of basic QoL things that have become standards within the hunting genre, such as directional cones for blood trails to make tracking less tedious to the basic ability to set up tree stands or blinds and apply scent cover. This title does very little to stand out from other hunting games currently on the market and has a ways to go to even be considered competition.

Pros:
+ Animal models are very good, with good animations and transitions between animations. 
+ Foliage looks very good at a distance and not that bad up close.
+ Tracking animals by the blood trail is pretty interesting, the blood splatters are detailed and show the direction the animal was moving without being an arrow pointing right to them.  Tree limbs will be spattered with blood if the animal brushes up against them, and tall grass will also be spattered.
+ ""Hunting Sense"" gives you the toggle-able ability to see animal tracks, spoor, need zones, blood trails, etc with a light outline.  The fact that it is not on or off all the time and in an easy at-will keybind makes the game much more immersive and visually stimulating.
+ The Perks system gives you a type of progression without being tied to ""levels"".   
+ Small touches.  There are lots of these, far too many to go into in a quick review like this.  From the blood spatters, the focus on ethical hunting, the calls and sounds of animals moving, to an extra-long-range rendering distance for animals (about twice as far as Call of the Wild).
+ Animals age!  That young deer already has an impressive rack (don't giggle), but it has room to grow.  So let it grow.  It will become a trophy buck after a few more play sessions.  Though if you don't find it again, it may die of old age.   Seriously.   
+ This goes hand-in-hand with the previous pro, and that is that you can essentially make trophy herds by careful selection and culling.  That's an incredible level of detail in a game like this.
+ Varied calls allow you to call in the specific type of animal in a herd you're looking to hunt.  Does, low-quality males, and higher-quality trophy males.

Cons:
- No FOV slider on launch - Devs have already said this is coming in the near future.
- Some people have had the game crash on them.   Is this unheard-of on launch day for games?
- No way to change or alter keybinds at launch - Devs are already fixing this in the near future.
- Some controls are a bit sluggish, specifically weapon swaps.
- The visual transition to and from Hunter Sense is disorienting to some people.
- Multiplayer is unstable at launch - again, not unheard-of at launch (the game's been out for like 3 hours now) and I'd give it a week or so for them to get things much more stable.
- Weapon descriptions are pretty poor, as is information on which firearms are better for which animals at-a-glance on the shop page.  
- Shotguns only have bird shot.   Seriously?",1660677570,1660677570,True,269,12,0.731383204460144043,3,True,False,False

Love the sounds, The feel of the rifles and shotguns, the scopes are real and simulates parallax. Very realistic how the animals react.

I used to use a steyr mannlicher in 7mm REM and a streyr pro hunter in .270. Very good. Very intrigued to see where the updates go and the future of this sim. I suggest a few things for added immersion. (Just suggestions my 2 cents) ie: 1. possibility for animals to get injured with a bad shot and have to finish it with a follow up shot. 2. when you break the barrel of a shotgun or cycle the bolt on the rifles to reload after a round has been spent smoke should come out the breech and a little out the barrel as well.

Went hunting to help my Grandpa out through some tough times. Started tracking a heard for an hour. Intense listening, paying close attention for the faintest of sounds. Following the blood trail into the woods from the meadows. Got stuck in a tree.

Definitely something to play, its amazing and you can literally forget you're playing a game. Trust me, its worth the experience.

abysmal performance. i get around 50 frames @1440p with a 6700k, 32Gb of RAM and a 3080.
The AA doesnt seem to work, both options FXAA and temporal dont change a thing compared to off. everything looks jagged. and the pop ins are ridiculous as off now.

I have static Noise in the Audio (using a scarlett solo 3rd gen). mostly in the Music, so i turned that off, but also in the ambient sound. super annoying. 

You CANT REMAP KEYBINDS (WTF????) and the FOV is locked to 60 so you get motion sick with that head bobbing that you cant turn off either. 

I recommend you wait a couple patches, the gameplay itself seem spromising, sadly the game got [b][i]CYBERBUGGED[/b][/i]

I kept trying to figure out why the mouse movement is so bad, but eventually I found it's due to the FOV being locked into an extremely narrow angle with no way to adjust. Additionally, there are barely any firearms and equipment in the game, which I assume is due to the fact the devs opted to ONLY use officially licensed firearms and equipment, which does NOT include a good number of actual hunting cartridges used today. To top it off, the game has day 1 DLC, which should have been an instant ""NO BUY"" for me, but I really wanted to give this one a try anyway.",1660674611,1660674611,False,4,0,0.490697771310806274,0,True,False,False

-Missing any way to customize your controls... no really, I thought I was crazy to but I searched everywhere there is no control customization. Infact the only place they show controls at all are under the controller section so no idea what the PC controls are unless you just play and hit random buttons...

-No FOV options, I am running on a widescreen monitor and the view is so squished and distorted in this game that I could only play for so long before having to take a break due to headache and nausea.

-Guns feel lackluster, they are not the worst I have ever felt they will do but they certainly don't have a clean punch feeling like Hunter call of the wild does. If you are expecting that level of gun physics and feel you will be very disappointed.

-Overall just feels like a rushed port with no PC features and lackluster gunplay. If they update the game and add FOV sliders and PC controls I will put more time into it and can see if the game gets better enough to change my review but until then it is honestly unplayable for me when there are so many other great titles out right now to spend my time on instead.",1660674016,1660674016,False,4,1,0.501814544200897217,0,True,False,False
