I player the 2 so I will compare this two from the serial game.

the first are the skill from the general, that over 90 % of the in-game skills are either miss or no effect, it's really hard to enjoy the battle while most of the skill can't work, the other problem are the AI while hang around in every match, in-game AI them can't fight well I must say.

you had two types of general, one is warrior other one is caster, by combine this two kind of general there plenty of room that you could enjoy, the market and diplomatic kind of useless, while most of time you couldn't earning enough gold to buy, by the time you could purchase you already finish conquest most of the  towns in whole map.

and the maps are the same when different times, which meaning there no different on second or third play through, there little joy from it since most of the creature and wild army appear at the same location, the final little complain are when near end game, most wild army from the maps spammer crazy message which bombarded you over and over.

Bot from this game are terrible, most of the time Bot either do nothing or focus on doing strange action, like spread them troops into different location which lead a easy chance for player control force.

the end that most thing this game need are publish the English version.",1656854116,1657050868,False,2,0,0.529005527496337891,0,True,False,False

1. right click ""heroes of the three kingdoms 7"" in library >  ""manage"" > ""browse local files""

2. look for the file ""Sango7"" (configuration settings) file type or ""Sango7.ini""

3. change the line from ""m_bFullScreen = 1"" to ""m_bFullScreen = 0""

4. change the line from ""m_bBGActive = 0"" to ""m_bBGActive = 1ss"" then save

5. right click ""Sango7"" (application) file type > ""troubleshoot compatibility""

6. click ""troubleshoot program"" >  tick ""the program opens but doesn't display correctly"" >
   > tick ""error message saying the program needs to run in 65536 colors or 16 bit color mode""
   > ""test the program"" the game should run smoothly now (if the game is slow or if the game looks purple go to step 6b) > ""next"" > ""yes, save these settings for this program""

6b. close the program > ""next"" > ""no, try again using different settings"" tick both ""the program opens but doesn't display correctly"" and ""the program worked in earlier versions of windows but won't install or run now"" > ""Windows XP Service Pack 3"" > tick ""error message saying the program needs to run in 65536 colors or 16 bit color mode"" > ""test the program""> ""next"" > ""yes, save these settings for this program""
