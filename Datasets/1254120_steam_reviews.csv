Regional events that are happening all the time, with reward cooldowns that support not being able to play for hours every day.

A combat system that feels smooth and intuitive. Complex enough to be engaging, but straightforward enough that I can plug in an play without feeling completely overwhelmed, even after months away.

Very little gating of content. Even crafting allows players to participate in all available professions. No need to select and forego.

The quests are voice acted well, and the quests are easy to do in small increments while still maintaining a feeling of forward progression.

Story OK, not gripping like FFXIV or SWTOR

Gameplay is good; combat has weight, there's combos and dodging. Nice pace to it, not too fast. There's matchmaking for group activities. Crafting/fishing is pretty easy to get into and world bosses are pretty fun. Not really any P2W things tbh. PVP is pretty fun as well. The questing system is kinda like GW2

1, The loot that drops are worse than terrible... not sure how they expect you to improve your Gear Score when all the high level mobs (world bosses) and dungeons your level drop items far worse than what you are already wearing? makes no sense...
Maybe a ploy to get you pay real money to buy the currency to buy the gear from the in-game player traders?
2, Trade post is terrible... so many menus to navigate through just to be able to sell/buy an item, and no player-player trading... all trade done through trade post, in an mmo !
3, most of the top level mobs constantly have an AOE effect around them, making melee classes (Berzerker/Crusader) at a huge disadvantage when fighting them, as getting close to do actual damage is virtual suicide.
4, Sadly over the past few weeks iv'e seen fewer and fewer people playing (EU Server), the main hub areas that were bristling with people just weeks ago are now ghost places harbouring a few die-hards and goldsellers. I can't advise spending your time in the game when the numbers are so low and falling daily...

But for me it was the lack of loot that was the final nail in the coffin... to progress needing (Star seeds) to buy stupidly expensive items in the player auction house as all you get it trash.

2.) Camera gets locked when you accidently press or the enemy is too far away and you press lock on and your camera literally have a seizure and ruins game play. It's really not fun and annoying and I have died in dungeon when this did happen.

3.) When someone VOTES TO END dungeon hooo this is sooo frustrating your CHARACTER cant attack, roll, NOTHING UNLESS you press agree or disagree.. GET RID OF THAT. Sure we need vote to end dungeon but it shouldn't STOP MY CHARACTER TO PLAY. I've lost SEVERAL dungeons thanks to this vote mandatory you guys imp laced. PLEASE, for the love of god I love doing dungeons but THIS RUINS THE DUNGEON GAMEPLAY.

4.) If you take the time to play ranger like I have the skill ""Tempest volley"" doesn't WORK. Yes, you heard it right, try playing the ranger and keep pressing the button sometimes LITERALLY sometimes it holds and DISABLES on its OWN. Please get that bug fixed ASAP, really frustrating while PVPING!|

5.) Implant more Movement speed elixirs. You got literally every elixir in the game but movement speed. You got HP, Defense, Dmg, Crit, Crit dmg, Defense decrease and dmg increase but no MOVEMENT SPEED!. The only MOVEMENT SPEED we have is from the Blessing in towns and THAT GETS DISABLED IN DUNGEONS!!. If no to movement speed elixirs then decrease the stamina consumed when rolling and etc. You are minimized to moving in this game which is fine that's why Elixir of movement speed would be amazing.

6.) When ANYONE is above you in the stairs lets say for example.. My ARROWS cannot hit them because they're above me? Such as thundering arrow?? This is the FIRST, FIRST EVER MMORPG where I can't hit someone because of the SLOPE? Like WHAT? PLEASE HAHA THIS IS SO STUPID IDK HOW ITS IN THE GAME BUT FIX THAT. PLEASE LMAO

HOW COME YOU CAN DYE REGULAR AMORS WITH NO OUTFITS BUT THE OUTFITS I BUY WITH REAL LIFE MONEY I CANT DYE??????????? WHAT THE HECK IS UP WITH THAT??????????

Had fun untill level 31+ , Now left the game as it s pointless game, got my founder package, but hoping major changes under mentioned areas.

Lumen (Premium currency
Is a joke. If you think, alright, i will spend 5€ on that free to play game, to increase my storage capacity (which is intended as you have super limited storage, most things stack on low amounts like 20 or 100, when item crafting will require like 400)..

1 SINGLE backpack slot costs 3 Euros. it has to be a typo it should be 3 pesos.
As you also have account storage and warehouse storage and they are even more expensive.

MARKETPLACE:
Game currency is a joke.
Basically devs are fighting against Star seed sellers(actual currency you can use to buy things).
Without founders pack etc.. i maybe have earned around 50k star seed in that time. (you can transfer gold into star seeds N times, depending on your level)
So trading economy is bollocks.. legendary gear sells for 1.5m il star seed and more, so only if YOU BUY star seeds from sellers, you can obtain those items or spend grinding days for that luck.

END GAME:
Basically, almost no one PvP-s, as there is no point in that (Need to have super active guild who helps to farm also PvP gear, as gears have single stat, which basically means if it s PvE or PvP gear.).
All end game is basically grinding the same dungeons or world bosses
NB: Monsters Scale! therefore no matter how much you spend your time on gear grinding, AI will dynamically increase in level and HP. Turning it into useless.

Dungeon AI will keep the same level scale, so that s nice.. Open world is useless as a sock inside a sandal.

except high AI latency. It was pretty fun.
Kills are shared, quests progress is shared. World boss loots are shared etc..

Is this a genre changing MMO? No it is not. Is this a game you should avoid? No. It is not.

I have not been a fan of tab targeting for oh ... going on about 7 years. The action combat here is decent.
You can briskly move through the primary quest chains, or meander through LOTS of side quests.

Is there a cash shop? There sure is. Do you need to buy items from the cash shop, to progress? No. Plenty of gear drops, and mini co-op events with even more drops. Costumes in the cash shop are cosmetic only, no buffs.

End game in any MMO is a slog. I still don't understand peoples rush to max out as quickly as possible. I'm in no hurry, and so far enjoying the journey.

This game is not a 10/10 best new MMO. But its fun enough to keep me interested. It is a MASSIVE improvement in the technical department over the last Bless. my FPS stay pretty solid and can actually play the game in high traffic areas. The combat starts off slow and clunky but turns into something that is actually pretty cool(but still a bit clunky) I have no idea of any sort of story as i have skipped all cut scenes. Most of these Korean MMO's stories are not good anyways.  The game shows its age usually with weird model shading but i am sometimes surprised by little details like real time reflections on metallic surfaces (Armor/Weapons etc). I do feel some of the balance scaling is weird. Field bosses one shot people even 4 or 5 levels above them which seems strange. I feel like i take a ton of damage from sources that i dont notice till i'm very low. So, little quirks here and there.

I was able to play for about 9 minutes the first time, to which I was met with no English on the NA Server at all; So be it, this game isn't much for PUGging anyway. Then minute 10 came with a crash. The recommendation is to disable overlays. Tried - More crashes. I am unable to play for more than 5 minutes without a crash - And by 'crash' I just mean the game stalling, esp in cutscenes, and 'Not Responding' to Windows. The Disc/Forums/Reddit is filled with people with this issue, but I haven't seen any replies.

I asked how to submit a ticket, but no reply - Official support is ""via Discord"", despite having a ticket system in game. Any attempt to use the console Bless (Actually maintained) is met with ""This is a different studio, please go to their webpage"".

I enjoy this game, it's a fun, casual, RPG. However, this studio is not earning any of my recommendations in the current state.

And yes I play BDO which has PvP forced to be on. Except there is no cash shop item to remove PvP and the death for PvP is annoyance, nothing serious. The world is massive (zones in this game are crowded and small) so PvP is extremely rare to begin with. 

Never played a game where you pay real money per hour to have no PvP.
