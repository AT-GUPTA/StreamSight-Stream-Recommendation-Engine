        [td] The game looks fantastic! The world looks beautiful and the weather system helps make the world look even better. The car models are stunning and really detailed. The character models look pretty good too. Sadly the mirrors do not work, and the steering animation is horrible. You're lucky to get a 90 degree turn. The character just barely turns it and it can be distracting if you are playing in the interior view. Also the UI in my opinion just feels messy and can take a little bit of time to get used to. Besides that gripe, the game is just stunning and in my opinion aged pretty well.[/td]

        [td]🎮Gameplay[/td]
        [td] The Crew 2 has some really good features. One is the incredible amount of cars here. You have dirt bikes, speed bikes, planes, helicopters, demolition cars, sportcars, race cars, F1 cars, etc. The list is absolutely insane and one of the best car lists in any game out there. The upgrade system is simple and has good progression, luckily you can switch your upgrades to other cars in their respective category so the grind for upgrades is not that bad here. The grind for money (in my opinion) is horrible. Making money here will suck and takes forever to make good money, especially if you are wanting to get many vehicles in the game. Some may like it, but I don't. The Motorpass (which is basically like their season/battlepasses) is a complete joke. Now you can get the Motorpass for “free”, but have fun spending 3+ million for it, or hey you can spend real money. You do have the option to spend real money in this game (hint at the insane grind). It kinda overshadows the experience, but nowhere near as bad as the events (I will talk about in the story section). The sense of speed is really good here and you do have some sort of customization. Don’t expect a need for speed levels of customization, but it’s pretty solid, it just depends on what vehicle you want to customize (as some don’t really have many options). The photo mode is really good here too, you can change the weather, time of day, with many awesome filters to mess with (perfect for you photographers). The physics here are actually pretty solid. The drifting though was a mix bag, but once you get use to it, it’s okay (still nothing great).[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]📜Story[/td]
        [td] The story is pretty vague. Basically just beat all of the main events (Freestyle, Offroad, Pro Racing, Street Racing, etc). You also have many more events since this game has been getting frequent updates. The Summit allows you to unlock limited time items and vehicles which are actually really fun and rewarding. Some of the other events are fun though, like dirt biking for example and street races. Sadly most of the events are a bore fest. Mainly just racing yourself and no one else (well a timed race but same thing). You will do these timed races ALOT! I almost lost my mind just doing these races. The ending didn’t feel all that rewarding here and I was immediately back into the grind of doing these boring event races. This is the biggest weakness The Crew 2 has, so just be warned that most events are pretty underwhelming here.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎭Multiplayer[/td]
        [td]The multiplayer was pretty fun here. Being able to do races with your friends was a blast. The best part was traveling around the map with a buddy. Doing cruises in some JDM cars or motorcycles was an absolute blast. Even cruising in planes/boats or going off road on a dirt bike felt so unique compared to other racing games (like the Forza Horizon series for example). Honestly if you are planning on buying a game to cruise with friends, this is a must buy for that reason alone. It was super addicting and fun.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🕛Playtime[/td]
        [td]With the amount of content and events, you have a ton of playtime here. The grind will also promote a longer playtime as well. If you can get a buddy to play with you will sink in a ton of time here. The game took me around 50 hours to get all of the achievements, and I still have a ton of cars to unlock so you will have a ton of time with progression in The Crew 2 no problem![/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎧Sound[/td]
        [td]The cars sound pretty average. I will say some cars do sound really good, but don’t expect most of them to sound impressive. The dialogue here is horrible. With cheesy lines that will make the hair on your neck stand up from cringe. Ubisoft has a thing for bad dialogue, I don’t know why.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]❗Bugs❗[/td]
        [td] I have gotten stuck on rocks plenty of times, so offroading can be kinda sketchy. I had my game act weird with the menu at times. With me having to exit the menu and starting it up again helped. Like it wouldn’t load up the next menu, it can be odd at times.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🔅Performance[/td]
        [td]The game runs at a solid 60 fps on max settings so frame drops were non-existent here. The bad part is that I would be getting these stutters during races. Not during free roam, which was weird. But certain events would make my game stutter. I tried lowering my graphics, or turning off Uplay overlay but nothing changed at all for me. This could just be a me issue so keep that in mind.[/td]

        [td]🔗Conclusion[/td]
        [td]The Crew 2 has a beautiful map, and a huge diverse car list that I adore greatly. Sadly the events and issues surrounding this game, makes this a mixed bag for me. I’m gonna recommend it because it may not be for me, but I can see many people enjoying this game that want a more casual and easy racing game. This game has very little challenge (except the grind), so if you are a more casual player, you may enjoy this game. Just know that the events are underwhelming, but you can explore an amazing map with friends and have a good time. Just make sure you put the time in to get the cars you want as the progression is really slow. [/td]

The original Crew 1 is shutting down March 31st, 2024. This is a huge disappointment because I used to really like the original one, to the point I acquired 2 copies (on separate Ubisoft Accounts).

I'm not review bombing this as it makes no sense to, but I'm very disappointed in the path you would go. Some people (well I'm not one of them who paid full price each time) will miss the original title, and if the way I see it happens, The Crew 2 is subject to the same treatment in the coming years.

A lot of disappointment in 2024 already starting. I'd like to see more optimistic approaches for the remainder of this year.

Original review below (2018):

A lot of reviews I've read are related to a mistake that happened yesterday (June 28) but they have appeared to have fixed the issue since 8:00AM Pacific this morning.

I know a lot of reviews are writing about how crappy that is, but the point of this review is to point out that not everything is wrong.

For The Crew 2, when it was announced in E3 2017, I had lots of high hopes. This led my uplay account to be flagged (in a good way) to enter the Closed Alpha (NDA required), the Closed Beta, and the Open Beta. I also pre-purchased the Gold Edition since April 2018, and had absolutely no launch issues when it went live at 9:00PM PDT June 25.

Let me go in depth on why this is a good game, and my recommendations:

[b]Positive:[/b]

[b]+ Very large open world[/b]
This is a core aspect of the game. In fact [spoiler]one of the achievements requires you to go outside of the map zones, which is easily done in New England with an airplane[/spoiler] and it has an icon of an octopus, which actually is pretty funny.

[b]+ Variety of races[/b]
At the start of the game, you are thrown into a series of crazy races. These involve 3 of the [spoiler]10 or so discliplines of The Crew 2[/spoiler] and then you must complete a series of trials to unlock the ability to purchase those types of vehicles. They give you one vehicle for free on the 1st disclipines of each branch of racing which are [spoiler]Street Racing, Pro Racing, Offroad, and Freestyle[/spoiler] while the rest you must purchase with in-game cash.

[b]+ In-Game Cash seemingly easy to make[/b]
Unlike The Crew 1 (which I got for free during Ubi's Christmas one year), The Crew 2 puts efforts into their money system easier. Crew Credits (CC) do make a return, however it is not an absolute core to buying the dream car you want. While playing The Crew 2's early access Gold Edition, I managed to purchase the most expensive car in the game upon reaching the [spoiler] Icon 1 [/spoiler] rank. There also is an achievement related to this as well on Steam. I only say this point because every time you rank up, they [spoiler]Pay you $125,000 and 10,000 CC except past Icon 1[/spoiler].

[b]+ Different ways to explore the game world[/b]
Well the first thing is, some people think (especially those who've played The Crew 1) the ability to ""Fast Travel"" was removed. But, actually, this was removed to a small extent - you can still travel to event start locations and skill start locations as well. Besides, while driving on the game world, you might encounter [spoiler] Live Rewards, which give loot drops, which are almost always upgrades. Blue upgrades also give an affix, and Purple upgrades give 2 affixes [/spoiler].

Neutral:

[b]Airplane Controls are iffy plus cause issues for new players[/b]

By Default the controls for airplanes are actually self-explainatory in the introduction, but I strongly recommend you disable STICKY KEYS and FILTER KEYS (you do not need to dsiable TOGGLE KEYS, the game doesn't require you to use that key) and  (from Windows Accessibility commands) because you will run into those two always if you use the default controls. (R+Shift to decrease altitude, R+CTRL to increase altitude, W to increase throttle, S to reduce throttle, A and D to turn fast)

[b]Loot drops sometimes go in your favor, other times, they don't.[/b]

This isn't really a negative point, but when you see Blues and Purples drop, you have to look at the affixes (F9 on performance screen) and see if they are good affixes. [spoiler]All the affixes you do see are actual unlockables for Icon Points, once you reach Icon 1.[/spoiler] Due to this, I sometimes must use lower quality item parts to keep the good affixes on my vehicles.

[b]GPS sucks compared to The Crew 1[/b]

Forgot to add this point in my comprehensive review. This is actually a problem because it forces you to pay attention to your map (since there is no line, like there was in The Crew 1) and they should consider re-adding it.

Negative:

[b]-No PVP Interactions in game (extremely rare)[/b]

Unlike The Crew 1, finding a player in-game at the same time is very rare. Not to mention, it's almost impossible to spot out their location on the in-game map. This is a mistake and should be corrected, since The Crew 1 was known for that reason.

[b]-PVP Modes unavailable at launch[/b]

I do not usually PVP, but I understand that people are upset that they did not include this feature at launch. However, Ivory Tower developers and The Crew 2 discord users have confirmed that their major update in September will release [spoiler]Legendary loot drops (I'm going to assume 3 affixes) and the Hovercraft races.[/spoiler] Unfortunately, we have to wait for PVP until December (in their 2nd major update.)

[b]-You probably need a good computer to run this game[/b]

There are some locations that I've lagged out with a fairly decent rig (GTX 1060 6GB & i6500 4.4Ghz) and there is a frame cap of 60 (which is not necessary but I see why they are doing that). 

[b]CONCLUSION[/b]

The Crew 2 absolutely lives to my expectations, even more then when I purchased Destiny 2's $100 edition. The fact I shedded out $100 for The Crew 2 (and invited into all phases of their testing) should tell me that it was going to be a great game.

Graphics: 10 / 10 (excluding high system requirements and 60 FPS cap)
Sound: 10 / 10 (good music choice, always keep it on. Theme is spot on, you also can unlock it through the Ubisoft Club.)
Gameplay: 10 / 10 (lots of races to choose from)
Multiplayer: 6 / 10 (for now, until the 1st major update)
Loot/Vehicle Variety: 9 / 10 (not Battlefront 2 or NFS Carbon, thank goodness.)
Leveling Flow: 10 / 10 (Very consistent, and very lasting)
[b]OVERALL: 9.17 / 10[/b]

[b]Recommendation? [/b]
I recommend this game. But if you do not want to pay $60, wait for a sale.
It's a great game, and when they release their 1st major update, it will get better. Trust me.
Leveling system is incredible compared to The Crew 1, because [spoiler]after you reach Icon 1, you must reach Icon 9999 to complete the game lol[/spoiler].
It's a great game. Please give them credit for their hard work since E3 2017.",1530287690,1706025290,True,10,0,0.606227457523345947,0,True,False,False

I genuelly loved this saga since it got released on console and i have been playing the beta of this game.
it was always a mixed experience, but unique towards the other competitors and still is one of the biggest maps in racing games history (i don't blame you TDU <3). 

The gameplay felt really barebones but also kind of enjoyable. the switch between planes, airboats, motocross, etc, wasn't the most successfull thing as they mostly remained to gather dust and being recycled for Live Summit rewards, same concept happening with Motorfest being just a fancy look to compare difference between other companies.

Overall, if you really highly loved this saga and want to try it out then give it a go but a reminder that [u]this game might not stay for too long,[/u] i wish to you a great day and [i]one less subscription a month keeps Ubisoft away![/i]",1683112434,1706008509,False,0,0,0.499031811952590942,0,True,False,False

On its own terms the game shines ,with original ideas like Fast Nav,switching from plane to car to boat smoothly. This is a one of kind experience .

The crew 2 is impressive in terms of quantity, but i'm afraid they left out what matters  the most : attention to detail and quality. However some areas and aspects of the game are build well like impressive track designs and original ideas.

In terms of gameplay ,it feels arcade and less realistic..but once you understand how it works it's a decent experience. Feels different than other racing games on the market and that's a positive. 

I really liked the followers and loot systems. After each activity you earn followers that can increase your popularity level. At higher popularity levels you'll unlock more disciplines and activities.Also you earn parts to upgrade your car which provides a unique leveling system and a sense of progression.

I'm still waiting for Crew Motorfest on steam, it's strange how Ubisoft decides to shoot his own foot!

Pros:
-map size
-huge amount of content with original ideas

-The huge amount of content have a downside in terms of quality

But here I am in 2024 and running a MSI RTX3080. I am running it at 4k resolution on a 65"" screen. I am extremely happy with the graphics. The latency with my G27 wheel is not too bad either.

One of the downsides is that there doesn't seem to be live players that want to race etc. I don't know.... maybe I don't know something.  It's different to Project Cars type games.

The Crew 2, developed by Ivory Tower and published by Ubisoft, is an ambitious open-world racing game that offers a vast and diverse landscape for players to explore.

Strengths:

Expansive Open World: The Crew 2 boasts a massive and detailed open-world environment set in a scaled-down version of the United States. The diversity in landscapes, from bustling cities to scenic countryside, provides a rich playground for exploration.

Versatile Vehicles: One of the standout features is the wide variety of vehicles available, including cars, motorcycles, boats, and planes. The seamless transition between different vehicle types adds a layer of dynamism to the gameplay.

Stunning Visuals: The game's graphics are impressive, capturing the essence of various locations with attention to detail. The day-night cycle and dynamic weather contribute to a visually engaging experience.

Weaknesses:

Narrative and Characters: The storyline and characters may feel secondary to the overall gameplay. Some players might find the narrative lacking depth compared to other aspects of the game.

AI Behavior: At times, the AI behavior during races can be inconsistent, leading to moments of frustration. Improved AI logic could enhance the overall racing experience.

Innovative Features:

Photo Mode and Content Creation: The Crew 2 introduces a robust photo mode, allowing players to capture and share their best in-game moments. The content creation tools add a layer of creativity to the overall experience.

Live Xtrem Series: The addition of Live Xtrem Series events, featuring a combination of different vehicle types in a single race, adds a unique and exciting element to the racing genre.

Conclusion:

The Crew 2 successfully builds upon its predecessor, offering a thrilling open-world racing experience with a diverse range of vehicles. While it may have some narrative shortcomings and occasional AI issues, the game excels in providing an expansive and visually stunning world for racing enthusiasts.

good stuff: 
1- a lot of cars.
2- map is huge. 
3- a lot of good cars and bikes planes boats and hover boats.
4- a lot of free cars (you need to finish races or do challenges and its not that hard) unlike the old version of the game you have to work your ass off to get a single car imo.
5- a lot of crazy customization like you can have underflow and change wheel colors etc.
6- crazy cars.
7- drifting cars are easy.
8- you can get free battle pass or motor pass for free which is really good imo.
9- you can farm cars for the crew motor fest :).
what else...idk.

bad stuff: 
1- you cant change your character.
2- you cant reset your game progress in order to change your character.
3- my character is ugly. 
4- the handling of some cars or maybe all cars is bad comparing
to forza horizon 5.
5- you get kicked after few mins and you get kicked randomly
what else...idk.

the game overall is good for me.
cant wait for the crew motor fest.

EDIT: with the recent announcement that the crew will be shut down forever in march with no way to play it ever again, yea not too happy about that.

That being said you do you ubisoft but i imagine this means eventually the crew 2 and motor fest will be taken away from me as well along with other games i have paid $60+for, so i wont be buying anymore ubisoft games at full price anymore since its just basically a rental service now. and hopefully if you're someone reading this that hates the idea of paying $60+ for something to be taken away forever eventually that you do the same thing and wait for a sale or not even buy their games at all, let their new games sit on the shelf on launch day and no money come in until they have no choice but to reverse decisions like these or go broke eventually.

TL;DR; Game still sucks. 
- The soundtrack feels like you are eternally playing inside an elevator. Indie games have better soundtrack than this game.
- Story and Progression is non existent. And every single NPC sounds like an A Hole, why is everyone so aggressive to one another? It sounds like the development switched directions at some point and they already had the voices recorded.
- Devs/Managers refuse to fix the Dualsense controller bug - It might be intentional? I wonder.  
- Compared to Forza, driving is just awful, it is not just because it is arcade either. To be honest GTA III did better vehicle physics than this game. And on the topic GTA Vice City probably did Boats and Planes better too.
- And don't get me started about the rarity/score upgrade system. It is an annoying way to smoke screen your player into not noticing that: in reality, you don't have all that much content. To say the least. 
- Whoever planned and developed the UI/UX and keybinding for it needs to be arrested by the gaming police. Slow, Clunky, Nowhere near streamlined, it is a Maze. I bet you 100 bucks a 5 year old can plan a better UI. Damn frankly I can do it myself. 

I want to end this by saying TC1 was a better game.

=====

Ever since the Alpha and Beta I posted on the forums regarding some of what will be present on this feedback.

TL;DR the game feels, unpolished, rushed and unfinished. It does not have a tenth of the immersion The Crew 1 had. Although the car models look nice some have incomplete customization options and the scenery in general looks poor/worse  than The Crew 1.

The Story:
  Even though The Crew 1's story was somewhat weak, The Crew 2 simply gives no mention of importance to put you in the game with a nice story driven content. And to make it worse everyone you meet at the start of the game seems to be a jerk. It really throws me away from even trying to like the characters.

Menus: 
  The Menus and GUI are a pain. I had to spend a few minutes just to figure out that Ubisoft, out of their endless pit of knowledge, decided no to use the ESC button to call in the menu. But then again, the whole UX and UI is slow and sluggish, too many clicks and lack of critical information all over the place.

Un skipabble content:
   There is a lot... get used to it.

Planes:
   Planes feel sluggish and slow and the flight dynamics are just awful, even for the most arcadish ever simulation of a plane I can think of, the model lacks just too much to be fun. And of course the default control scheme will get you into a keyboard ghosting situation real quick. 

Cars and Boats:
   Well no complain here, they feel fast and have a nice handling - so far. Although I feel there is a lot of customization missing in the game.

There is a lot to be done, and I doubt they will, better keep with The Crew 1.",1538968578,1704049568,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

As long as the product is sold and non-refundable, they are good. If the patch doesn't come out for the game that is being taken down just because Online features and upkeep of the servers are not feasible things for the company, it will clearly show there the interest lies. 

People get it, keeping up with server payments and infrastructure is costly and doesn't get cheaper, but if you pull a license from paying customers just like that, I really hope people will take notice and never buy anything from them going forward. 

I won't, and will do my best to advise everyone I can to steer clear from companies like Ubisoft and Electronic Arts. 

And I really do hope companies that feel that it's an okay thing to do to their customers will implode and close up shop. It would suck for talented people who work on good games, but they are not the ones that profit from their own creations.

Edit: If anything, it would be somewhat of a fun time to pirate games of the said company to enjoy them for free. And without the constant worry that the library I've spent money on will go AWOL because some asshole in a suit made a call. I'm more than happy to pay for games I play, but the sad reality we all worried about for about a decade and a half start to creep in - If it's not Physical, don't buy it. I'm sure there will be more and more precedents like this and the big companies will hide behind ""anti-piracy drm"" argument with their Always Online bullshit as well.

Of course this is not a racing ""simulator"" so don't expect it to be very ""realistic"" but if you like racing games, it's a really cool game. A lot of cars, motorcycles and many other vehicles to choose from, a lot of races etc. The only downside is that it's an ""always online"" game even if you play solo like me.

The Crew 2 kind of does this, but in an extremely unfulfilling way. It takes the joy out of actually traversing across these states due to unpolished vehicle movements, wonky ai mechanics and poorly rendered surroundings. The civilian vehicle npcs are tragic and will oftentimes disappear 100 feet in front of you, being somehow replaced by either thin air or a different vehicle altogether. They'll honk at you if they're in the opposite lane on a bent road (unpolished distance/impact measuring). The ones walking around in the cities will dramatically jump out of the way even though you're just casually cruising on the road, nowhere near the sidewalk. 

The switching mechanic is kind of cool, but again doesn't really get used enough. Not only does it ruin immersion but it's trying too hard to be multiple things at once. Oddly, being in the plane feels like home for this game. The textures don't look that crappy from up there and you won't notice the ai as much.

The whole thing just feels like something Ubisoft would make and they definitely stuck with their formula on this one.

Sorry, this is absolutely inexcusable. They tried this with their DLCs last year (but rowed back due to the sh**storm), yet seriously, now this again??!! Don’t get me wrong, The Crew 1 is actually a great game which has quite some single player story content, obviously even an offline mode is integrated hidden in the files (due to some programmers in the community who are working on a mod, see the forum discussions), so there’s obviously no real reason to not give us customers (who paid for all those expensive season passes and DLCs) an offline function. Ubisoft really needs to stop their extremely toxic anti-consumer behavior, because meanwhile even I (I always defended them in the past) am losing interest in their products. And another joke, if you want to complain at the moment, there’s even no official Ubisoft internet forum anymore, only one on Discord (where all discussions get lost anyway).

Embark on a cross-country journey in The Crew 2, where land, air, and sea converge to create a diverse and expansive playground for motorsport enthusiasts. With a multitude of vehicles and an open-world expanse mimicking the USA, the game promises a high-speed, action-packed experience. However, it's not without its share of strengths and weaknesses.

Pros:

Multifaceted Gameplay: The Crew 2 introduces a unique blend of racing disciplines, allowing players to seamlessly switch between cars, bikes, boats, and planes. The sheer variety of vehicles and racing modes adds an extra layer of excitement to the gameplay.

Vast Open World: Spanning the entire USA, the open-world map offers a rich and expansive playground for exploration. The ability to engage in leisurely drives, road trips, and intense races across iconic locations contributes to the game's immersive experience.

Vehicle Variety: The game boasts an extensive collection of vehicles, ranging from traditional cars to boats, planes, and bikes. This diversity caters to different racing preferences, ensuring that players can find a vehicle that suits their style.

Visual Improvements: Over its predecessor, The Crew 2 exhibits graphical enhancements, showcasing improved visuals and more detailed environments. The game captures the beauty of various landscapes, enhancing the overall visual experience.

Continued Content Updates: Despite the release of The Crew 3, The Crew 2 continues to receive content updates, including new game modes, tracks, vehicles, and events. The ongoing support from developers keeps the game fresh and engaging.

Community Engagement: With a large player base, The Crew 2 fosters a sense of community among players. The option to play with up to seven friends online enhances the social aspect of the game.

Accessibility: The game offers a trial period, allowing players to experience The Crew 2 for free for a limited time. This feature provides an opportunity for players to determine if the game aligns with their preferences before making a purchase.

Enjoyable Exploration: The game excels in delivering an exploration-focused experience, allowing players to casually drive through iconic locations and relish the diverse landscapes.

Cons:

Inferior to Predecessor: Some players express disappointment, stating that The Crew 2 falls short of its predecessor in various aspects. This sentiment extends to elements such as boats and planes, which are considered by some as gimmicks, and the game's wheel support, perceived as inferior to the original.

Performance Issues: Certain players report performance issues, including crashes and lock-ups, particularly on high-end rigs. Such technical problems may impact the overall gaming experience and potentially lead to frustration.

Monetization Concerns: Microtransactions and the introduction of predatory practices in the form of paid content have raised concerns among players. While not forced, these microtransactions can restrict access to significant content, creating a sense of frustration.

Repetition and Lack of Challenge: The single-player experience is criticized for its repetition, with a noticeable bias toward Street Race events. The abundance of Street Race events compared to other disciplines, combined with AI that lacks challenge, contributes to a less enthralling single-player experience.

Devs' Lack of Responsiveness: Players express frustration over what they perceive as a lack of responsiveness from developers to player feedback. The perception that the developers prioritize monetization over addressing player concerns may impact the overall relationship between the gaming community and the development team.

Limited Variety and Boring Events: Despite the promise of diversity, some players find the game lacking in variety, particularly in terms of the vehicles introduced through updates. The focus on Street Race events, both in the base game and updates, can lead to a monotonous experience.

Empty and Bland Map: The open-world map is criticized for feeling empty, bland, and at times soulless. Copy-pasted elements, stretches of empty road, and condensed towns contribute to a map that falls short of the vibrant and dynamic environment expected in an open-world racing game.

Graphical Quality: While there are visual improvements, some players find the graphics, while good, not up to the standards set by other modern racing games like Forza.

Final Verdict:

The Crew 2 navigates a mixed terrain, offering a multifaceted racing experience set in an expansive open world. While it successfully introduces diverse vehicles and gameplay modes, it stumbles in areas such as performance issues, monetization concerns, and perceived shortcomings compared to its predecessor. For players seeking an accessible and exploration-focused racing game with a variety of vehicles, The Crew 2 may be a worthwhile experience. However, those prioritizing realism, robust challenge, and a responsive developer-player relationship might find some aspects lacking. The game's strengths lie in its community engagement, vast open world, and ongoing content updates, making it a decent choice for those looking for a casual open-world racing experience.",1591107044,1702053279,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Quite likely my favourite thing are the 40 minute races you can have in this game without ever driving on the same road twice. A little pricey for the game's age, maybe wait for a sale.

Visually, it's in this weird in between. The free roam and most races will look pretty bad in 90% of the cases, very flat colors, lack of detailed textures on buildings, and the general shading looks quite fake and off. But in certain free roam situations and races, when the settings are just right, it looks GORGEOUS for no reason. Cars look good but some models have lower polygon count, but that's to be expected if you want to fit 600+ vehicles in a 60Gb game. 

Gameplay is... not it. The cars feel way too responsive and grippy, and even a slight steering input might make your car go crazy. It's not helped by the fact car settings aren't well explained, you don't even know what does what. 
Don't even get me started on planes. If you don't have the ""feeling"" for them, then you're going to hate those.
The structure of the game is interesting, I like the 4 branches with many disciplines in them, and once you complete enough in a branch, you get to fight its boss for a big cash reward and a new car. Also some races switch up the vibe of the game drastically (like that one Street Car event that makes the game look like a retro game).
I personally am fine with the Motorpass, it gives an avenue to earn cosmetics and the paid pass that allows for unlocking premium rewards is a one time purchase, which I appreciate. It is a bit too expensive though.
I do feel quite annoyed by the ""premium money"" packs that trivialise some things like buying new cars but a lot more annoyed at the fact it's the only currency that can buy cosmetics that rotate every week, I don't like it when games try to exploit FOMO even if it's just with visual stuff.
My personal favorite feature though, is the fact that if you're going to play The Crew Motorfest, you'll be able to import your TC2 collection of cars and cosmetics, which actually doesn't make your TC2 collection disappear, it's just getting copied over to TCM which is great imo.  

Music is solid, some good choices are in there but I'm sad there's no songs from The Heavy, their inclusion in 2014's The Crew elevated it in my opinion.

The game runs well enough on my PC, but 2014's The Crew had pretty bad periodic stuttering and while The Crew 2 doesn't have the exact same issue, I do encounter near-constant stuttering in the game. The solution I found was to lower my screen's refresh rate to 59Hz in Windows settings before launching the game. So be aware this game has issues.

All in all, it's a solid 14-15/20. It's fun, but the handling model will make you frustrated more than anything else. Can be worth it to get it before Motorfest if you're planning on playing it too.",1667281578,1701083701,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

One of the game's notable aspects is its expansive open-world map, featuring a scaled-down version of the United States. However, while the map is vast and diverse, the world lacks depth and fails to offer a truly immersive experience. The environments feel empty and devoid of life, making exploration less engaging than anticipated.

The variety of vehicles available is a highlight, allowing players to switch between cars, boats, planes, and bikes on the fly. However, the handling and physics of these vehicles often feel unrealistic and beyond arcade-like, detracting from the game's immersion. The lack of depth in the driving mechanics may disappoint players seeking a more realistic racing experience.

Additionally, the progression system feels uninspired and lacks innovation. The missions and races become repetitive quickly, lacking the necessary variety and challenge to keep players engaged in the long run. The storyline, too, feels shallow and fails to provide a compelling narrative to drive the gameplay forward.

The multiplayer aspect, while promising, suffers from various issues, including connectivity problems and a lack of meaningful interactions between players. This diminishes the potential for engaging cooperative or competitive experiences that could have added depth to the game.

In summary, Crew 2 falls short of expectations due to its lack of depth in the open-world design, shallow progression system, and underwhelming handling of vehicles. While it offers a diverse range of vehicles and a vast open world, the execution leaves much to be desired, resulting in a gaming experience that feels more hollow than immersive.",1700155195,1700555227,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
-LOTS of cars to choose from!
-Content heavy to keep you engaged!
-Massive condensed map of the U.S. 
-Race creator (recent updates)
-Interesting events
-Different types of careers (Street, Hypercar, Boat racing, Motocross, Stunt, Pro Racing, Airplane racing, etc.)

Neutral:
-Soundtrack; some bangers, other songs sound generic and forgettable.
-Customization is great but could be better if wed be given freedom to edit individual visual parts like in NFS HEAT.
-Graphics look like they are from later 2010's but its a sacrifice given the size of the map.

Cons:
-Engine noises sound like they were made for mobile apps.
-Physics: Cars handle like bricks, even with pro tuning some still handle heavy.
-Only up to 8 players in 1 lobby which is underwhelming given the size of the map.
-Only a party of 4. NFS HEAT can have up to 8 players in a party so why not in this game?
-PVP is not really there since I take more than 5 min to queue up and most of the time I get nothing.
- Cars are too pricey. It'd be best if the price were reduced by 50%.
-Upgrade system: don't really like the idea of collecting parts that are different colors with different stats as if it were some Fortnite weapon rarity. 
-Cringey voice acting. Just turn off the voices.

Overall: Solid racing game filled with tons of content to keep the player engaged and every update seems better than the last, especially with the upcoming MAD update. 8.5/10.",1700001834,1700189908,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Silent protagonist (probably for multiplayer stuff).
- BattlEye Service is making me to turn off something in my Windows Defender.

If you want fun gameplay, play The Crew 2. But if you want stories, play the first game instead.

game was fun for a bit, but it really gets held back by progression, replay-ability, and limited-time events and cosmetics

i wanted to try and collect every ""classic"" car in the game. for many hundreds of hours this was the only reason i didn't quit. then when they started having these limited edition vehicles, i gave up. vehicles i almost could never have or are wildly expensive for no real reason.

Side note: Try the pro config for more realistic driving, the standard version is more than enough, the graphics are great if we have in mind when was it released, good events with good oportunities to get limited edition cars, you can import your cars if you end up getting motorfest later (upgrade to the most recent the crew), it's a great game overall but it's not worth the full price, i'd get the motorfest instead for some extra bucks

Most of my progress is just from driving around the country. It's so relaxing to just take a nice car or bike and just go 70-90 miles, and the game is absolutely gorgeous. Highly realistic rain, beautiful bloom, fully decked out and functional car interiors and dashboards, gorgeous landscapes, etc. I much prefer to drive from the drivers seat camera, there's something so satisfying about it. And it works so well. And when it rains, the windshield wipers go. I just love the game so much. It's my goto when I have time constraints too, because I can just stop when I feel like it, there's no reason I have to play for any certain amount of time. It IS a bit of a time sink, but entirely by choice. It's incredibly satisfying.

EDIT: Replaced with better mobo and PSU. Ram also died so I replaced that. Everything is running fine now. Now that I'm sure my parts are good quality, I'm think it might just be this game is very clunky. It has a few, if minor bugs, like being unable to tab into and randomly crashing.

This is for anyone who is looking for a game to kill a few hours. The map is big, players have the option to switch between the three modes of transport while in-game. The whole map is unlocked after few initial hours of following the story the devs have designed, so you are on your own and have all the freedom to explore. 
Re-playability will always be there as there are many vehicles to choose from and as i mentioned, the map is quite big.

The city feels empty and unfinished, but the forest feels decent.

The handling of the car here is garbage. The cars feel too light. 
I rather play racing event in GTA V than this game. Heck even GTA SA ps2 has better handling than this game. 

The map in this game is so much worse than The Crew 1, It's practically the same but no snowy mountains.

It's fun and relaxing to just pick a spot and start driving aimlessly. Unforunately, it still feels empty because you can only have max 8 players in a session.

There are 598 vehicles in the game but it's a long grind to buy any. You get about 15-20k bucks for every race. But each car usually costs around 300-500k, so that's a lot of grinding, about 20-25 races to own another car. Only a handful of cars are under 100k. There's also their version of a Battle Pass called ""MotorPass"" which costs 3 million bucks.

There is multiplayer matchmaking but it takes a while to find a group, usually about 10-20 minutes. It's not obvious how to get to it as it's called ""Live Battle"" instead of multiplayer, and needs 4 players to start (8 max).

The Crew 2 is an exhilarating ride through an open-world racing paradise! The game's diverse range of vehicles, from cars and motorcycles to boats and planes, keeps the gameplay fresh and exciting. The sheer size of the game world is impressive, offering a vast and detailed virtual United States to explore. The ability to seamlessly switch between different vehicle types on the fly is a game-changer, adding a unique twist to races and challenges.

The graphics are solid, with a great attention to detail in the vehicles and environments. The game's variety of events and activities, including races, stunt challenges, and exploration tasks, ensures that there's always something to do. The multiplayer aspect is enjoyable, allowing you to team up with friends or compete against others in a wide range of events.

While The Crew 2 offers plenty of fun, it does have a few downsides. The story and characters are forgettable, and the AI can sometimes feel a bit predictable. Additionally, the in-game microtransactions might be a turn-off for some players.

Overall, if you're a fan of open-world racing games and don't mind a lackluster storyline, The Crew 2 offers an adrenaline-pumping experience with a vast playground of vehicles and challenges to conquer. It's a fun, fast-paced, and enjoyable ride.",1695823633,1695823633,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This open-world racing masterpiece has not only set a new bar for the genre but has also redefined what we should expect from racing games in the modern era.

Visual Spectacle (5/5):
The Crew 2 boasts a jaw-droppingly beautiful open-world rendition of the United States that's a visual feast for the eyes. From the sun-soaked streets of Miami to the serene landscapes of Yosemite, every inch of the map is meticulously designed, capturing the essence of these iconic locations. The game's attention to detail is second to none, making every turn, jump, and drift feel like a cinematic experience.

Unmatched Variety (5/5):
What sets The Crew 2 apart is its unparalleled variety. The game offers not just one type of racing, but a smorgasbord of disciplines, from street racing and off-roading to aerobatics and powerboating. Each discipline feels unique, with its own set of vehicles and challenges. Whether you're tearing through the streets in a high-speed hypercar or navigating treacherous mountain trails in an off-road monster, you'll find something to love here.

Seamless Transition (5/5):
The Crew 2's most impressive feature is its seamless transition between land, sea, and air. With a mere push of a button, you can switch between cars, boats, and planes, allowing for mind-bending and awe-inspiring moments. This mechanic adds a layer of strategy and creativity to the gameplay that I've never experienced before in a racing game.

Incredible Multiplayer (5/5):
The multiplayer experience is another area where The Crew 2 truly shines. Whether you're teaming up with friends for co-op challenges or competing against players from around the world in intense races, the seamless integration of multiplayer into the open world adds endless replayability.

Continuous Updates (5/5):
Ubisoft has proven their commitment to The Crew 2 with a steady stream of updates and expansions. New cars, boats, planes, and events are added regularly, keeping the community engaged and excited for what's next.

Minor Drawbacks (4.5/5):
While The Crew 2 is a nearly perfect racing game, there are a few minor issues worth mentioning. Occasionally, the AI can be a bit too aggressive, and some might find the grind for in-game currency a tad demanding. However, these are minor quibbles in the grand scheme of things.

In conclusion, The Crew 2 is nothing short of a racing masterpiece. Its stunning visuals, incredible variety, seamless transitions, outstanding multiplayer, and ongoing support from the developers make it a must-play for any racing game enthusiast. If you're looking for the ultimate open-world racing experience that will keep you hooked for hours on end, The Crew 2 is the game you've been waiting for. Strap in, rev up your engines, and get ready to embark on the ride of a lifetime. It's a game that deserves all the rewards on Steam and a place in the pantheon of gaming legends.",1694957592,1694957592,True,1,0,0.496183186769485474,0,True,False,False

One of the standout features of The Crew 2 is its massive and beautifully crafted open-world environment. The game offers a scaled-down version of the entire United States, providing players with a remarkable sense of freedom and exploration. From the bustling streets of New York City to the serene beauty of the Grand Canyon, the world feels alive and dynamic, making it a joy to simply cruise around and take in the sights.
The vehicle selection in The Crew 2 is vast and varied, catering to a wide range of racing preferences. Whether you prefer high-speed supercars, agile street bikes, nimble off-road vehicles, or even aerobatic planes, this game has it all. The seamless ability to switch between different vehicle types on the fly is a unique feature that adds a layer of excitement and versatility to the gameplay.
In terms of gameplay mechanics, The Crew 2 strikes a good balance between realism and accessibility. The driving and flying controls are intuitive and responsive, allowing both novice and experienced players to enjoy the game. The different racing disciplines, including street racing, off-road rallies, powerboat racing, and aerobatics, provide a refreshing variety of challenges and keep the gameplay engaging.

The multiplayer aspect of The Crew 2 is a significant improvement over its predecessor. Players can seamlessly team up with friends or compete against other online players in various events and challenges. The online integration adds a layer of competitiveness and camaraderie that enhances the overall experience. However, there are occasional connectivity issues and matchmaking problems that can hinder the online experience.
The visuals in The Crew 2 are undeniably impressive. The attention to detail in recreating iconic landmarks and cities is commendable, and the lighting and weather effects add a layer of realism to the game world. The game also features a dynamic day-night cycle, enhancing the immersion further. However, there are occasional instances of texture pop-in and minor graphical glitches that slightly detract from the overall visual fidelity.
While The Crew 2 offers a vast open-world, it does suffer from a lack of meaningful content at times. The main storyline is forgettable, and the missions can feel repetitive. The game heavily relies on a leveling system and an extensive collection of activities, but it would have benefited from a more engaging narrative to drive the player's progression.
Overall, The Crew 2 is a highly enjoyable racing game that successfully builds upon its predecessor's strengths. Its expansive open-world, diverse vehicle selection, and immersive gameplay mechanics make it a solid choice for racing enthusiasts. Despite some minor flaws and a lackluster story, The Crew 2 offers an adrenaline-fueled experience that will keep players engaged for hours on end.

pros:
-large map for open world fans (supposedly takes 30 mins to go east to west)
-large vehicle variety
-also large gameplay variety with several race types and loads of other activities
-pretty fun races especially the rallycross ones
-Good and right amount of grind. not too grindy that it gets boring but not too easy that its like that one game that starts with the letter F
-a lot of customization for (only) street cars
-vinyl customization babeyyyy

cons:
-engine noises sound too similar sometimes
-car upgrades barely feel like anything. its probably for the grind and all but lesser upgrades that take more time to take but have more noticeable effects 
-body customization only limited to street cars, good luck if you wanted to make your pro racing car or rally car look better
-you only get like 8 guys per multiplayer server despite having an extremely large map. unless youre hanging with friends then multiplayer is basically useless and empty here

in conclusion, good game overall with a huge variety in things to do and vehicles to own. my main issues are multiplayer being too small for the map scale and the upgrades being too gradual to actually visibly change much but other than that, if you like driving, exploring, racing, and all that stuff, and you want to race not just cars but boats, planes, and motorbikes, then this game's for you.

Somehow I managed to farm whole MotorPass (battle pass) to max lvl in one day and right now it can be bought via in game farmable currency so I even bought it in couple of days. Unfortunately, maybe we will see one more but that's it, because of upcoming release.

I was pleasantly surprised when figured we will be able to transfer some of our vehicles and vanities to the next title The Crew Motorfest.

I was unpleasantly surprised when I've found out that our dense developer didnt learn the lesson first time and won't release it in Steam anytime soon. Hence the negative review. Sorry not sorry. Cya in 4-5 years with -75%. Oh, and with the trophies, bitches !

Update:

I have recently purchased MSFS Anniversary, I had to jump some hoops to make that game work but at least someone there knew what was up.

For a lot of games to work, developers don't expect people to run different languages for their OS.

Enable and Use 

Language; Voice (And Speech); English (United States)

It's not your average cup of joe racing game out there, it's much more than that, you discover as you drive around and if that's your thing then grab it !

To put it in short its not like nfs, driver, forza and I personally wouldn't top it up as the others cause like others it has its flaws as well. However, driving around the United States in your GT500 , while going through different seasons is something you don't experience in other racing games out there except for maybe two seasons. When I mean the map is huge, it's HUGE, like a trip from NY to LA would typically take you around 1- 1.30 hours and that entirely depends on the vehicle you have. If you're into huge maps and love cruising and discovering new landmarks, this game is for you. 

I have heard direct comparisons with the The Crew  and I can verify that the graphics in The Crew are way better than the second installment, but don't let that stop you from buying the game.

Car Customisation: 8/10 - Way better than Forza Horizon 4

Its minor failures are, however, dwarfed by its huge successes; for the second game in a row, Ivory Tower has recreated the entire U.S. and this time added planes and boats into the mix too. It looks gorgeous, has a great soundtrack, heaps of customisation and a massive open world that’s full of stuff to do. More than anything though, it’s amazing to play a game where, in a couple of hours, you can race through the streets of New York, flip and spin on a monster truck course just outside L.A., loop and roll under the Golden Gate Bridge, and power past the Statue of Liberty in a powerboat.

Things I don't like:
* There's too much heavy/immovable junk to drive into for an open world driving game
* There's completely unnecessary traps scattered everywhere that you're forced to re-spawn out of once you fall into them, and if you dare try to off-road with a street vehicle...the game will re-spawn you NOT to the closest area before you got stuck, not even to the closest road. They will re-spawn you to the section of the last road you were actively driving on. This means, that if you're off-roading and you cross a road or drive on a road for a short amount of time and then go back off-road and get stuck...the game will dis-regard the close road you were just on and will still re-spawn you all the way across the map where you first turned off-road. 
* The cars will unpredictably come to a complete stop if you try to slide your car against a railing or wall. 
* Many of the races are dull yet frustrating, keeping you turning left, right, left, right etc. in a grid-pattern city for the majority of the race instead of having all the races at the same level of quality.  
* The guardrails on the sides of the roads are often unbreakable (even some wood ones). 
*In the menu the select button can bring up your car's part boosts....but be careful because that same button brings up the map if you accidentally press it twice. 
* The only thing that seems close to scale is the horribly limited room on the roads, you WILL crash into spawning traffic in this game because there is A LOT of spawning traffic.  

Things I like:
* Good selection of cars that all have interior views, a lot of the G.O.A.Ts are in here.
* Daily challenges aren't intrusive, they can be completed if you like but they're not annoying if you don't.
* Weekly challenges grant you plenty of extra cash and incentive to purchase new vehicles you haven't tried before. 
* After some tweaking in the settings, most players should be able to tune this game to be close enough to what they like to be able to start winning races whether you prefer simulation, arcade, or somewhere in between. 

Conclusion: There is some fun to be had if you're open minded, but there's too much that gets in the way of that fun that seems purposefully placed to stop you from playing/driving in this game. Not only could I not recommend this game, I would recommend that if the publisher wanted to sell a game that tries to stop you from playing...perhaps try making a puzzle game.",1688366139,1692929721,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am a single father to my Son, who is 15 now. My son got this game for from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 12 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he let me borrow his controller. Me and my son then played in turns and I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

Why? 
Well, for one the control's Don't include the mouse for control, Which, make the game very hard to play. 
Worse, the set game controlls are bad, as in you rash a lot and you can't control the plane at all and the boat race was just ok.
But i'm greatly saddnen that i was stuck on keyboard only settings, when i got this game i though it included my mouse as to turn the car left and right.

So people like me will probably have like 15 hrs to enjoy potentially.
HOWEVER, I would easily recommend the crew 1, and TDU1 and 2 even more, simply because the exploration itself is much more straightforward and sensible in its progression bar. TDU1 and 2 had uncovering streets by driving on them, probably the most straight forward, but it requires more teleporting, the crew 1 had uncovering by grids, which didn't make you run the same intersections constantly, but some grids were off-road, when the vehicles and terrain just wasn't there for it. The Crew 2 has weird checkboxes, things like ""enter location"", drive at specific time of day with specific vehicle in specific spot, get X pickups. It's all very non-linear in its progression, feels inconsistent, unrewarding, and some are just terrible straight up.

Now for those who just want racing and vrooming, it is a TON of ""content"", but they all repeat tracks CONSTANTLY, you click a new race, and it's just reversed or different weather. Then those several repeating ones in one category, repeat in ANOTHER category. You don't have to go back to a race after getting first place, cause you surely are going to get more of it as seperate instance.
For those who want to race, the experience can be downright miserable, the UI is awful to navigate, starting an event always involves not only loading the race area, but also completely useless downtime in its ""preparation spot"", some have additional pointless drive to the starting area, then they have a cutscene sometimes (some are even f***n unskippable), and then you start riding.
Once you think all is good in the world, after each race ends, you have massive progress bar animation which you can only skip by slowly opening and closing leaderboards, then you have loot that you have to manually ride over (or they get sent to a mailbox with god damn space limit, and you have to travel to seperately), and THEN they have a loading screen for actual multiplayer consistent weather of the area you are at.
ALL OF IT, REPEATED, EVERY SINGLE TIME, FOR EVERY RACE, not the mention that the game can be grindy as all hell if you want to buy a lot of vehicles. If you see my 30,40 or whatever 10s of hours on the clock, the amount spent on mundane s**t is unreal and I hope the FOMO element designers are whipped for YEARS to come, cause it is clearly intentional, designed to waste your time while building up your SUNK COST FALLACY on all of the time you spent. Also a lot of the prompts are ""hold interact"" instead of a tap, micromanaging upgrades every time, endgame progression being ""0.1% to a stat per level"" and then additional upgrade loots per 10 levels.

Words cannot describe how horrible the design of the game is, so much actually good craft of it, wasted because of what it tries to incentivize. I like the driving, I like the selection of cars, I like the views, I like cockpit view for basically every vehicle I tried, I like some of the random ""skill"" events I could run into, I like some of the music, but all that is buried under an insurmountable pile of trash. Not to mention horrible things like forced story, quirky characters (that I had to mute few minutes in), stupid visuals for some of the GUI or these awful emotes.

Unless you are insane like me, where you are willing to spend 5$ just to scratch that frustrating itch for an open world cruising game, I cannot recommend this game to anyone. It is filled with live service nonsense, even more forced MMO elements, required always online (with logoff for afk instead of offline driving), sEaSOnAL ""content"", and basically no respect for your time.
This thing horrifyingly reminds me of something like Destiny 2, and you have to fight with the game to enjoy anything out of it. At least it seems to be nowhere as popular, given how massive the discounts are, but that might be just in preparations for the third Crew game.
Either way, if this game is supposed to be a trend for what to expect from Crew 3, then I have no hopes for it, besides picking it up 5 years later for 5$ to scrape out some enjoyment out of it. Triple A market is dead, and I can't wait till the live service nonsense gets buried in the mobile market exclusively.",1691368384,1691368384,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The game runs better than forza horizon 5 hilariously because game devs don't know how to release decent products, this is one of those cases. After playing The Crew 1 you start to see how lack luster and bland this game is and how sad it's become, dominated by nothing but anti-socials sitting in menus or cheaters who use hacks to speed in street race vehicles extremely fast to ram and abuse other players as well as to cheat at summit live making getting summit live or motorpass vehicles impossible. Cars are way too overpriced for no real good reason and the cool cars are summitlive only and can't be bought with ingame money which is super stupid considering even a super skilled driver who has skills in many racing games with simulated and arcade handling can't get platnium on the stupid thing and never gets to get the car because of dumb hackers who are cheating and yet you can't even report them not even in freeroam when you catch them. The car's handling is absolute garbage even fully upgraded cars are either jello or jello and super understeer and feel like weightless toys that can fishtail suddenly for no reason on any corner even if you're doing multiple laps driving consistently. The AI have no respect for the player and will ram you akin to forza's garbage AI that disrespect racing rules of no contact and will hit your vehicle off, races are super easy to cut once you get enough nitro it's a game of who can figure out how to exploit track limits to get the best time ruining any type of racing fun. The grind even with over 500 icon points put into money is just annoying and dumb, hours in you'll struggle just to get a few decent cars and the same races are used for grinding that have no variation. Once you buy a OP car or earn one from the motorpass the AI even on the hardest difficulty become a joke and get absolutely dusted, offroad racing is a nightmare considering how poorly the vehicles handle and demolition derby ring fighting matches are broken and unfair with the AI even on super easy difficulty being extremely hard to beat since they literally fling themself off the arena after being slightly tapped by another AI or get caught on a wall then slammed into and destroyed.The offroad ghost when redoing offroad events you completed will leave you wondering why you're losing to the AI on easy difficulty non-stop and restarting non-stop till you realize after a while that it is your ghost and you don't have to beat it you just have to beat the AI's old time but don't have their ghost selectable so you can actually test vehicles and get an actual race.Vehicle modification is laughably bad alot of cars get nothing but rims and some don't even get that luxury; worked hard for a cool set of tires well too bad this car can't be customized. The traffic in hypercar races needs to be removed the traffic in general is cancer, they spawn in as fake box trucks 10 feet infront of you then despawn till they are 5 feet in your face then reappear too late as a ugly whatever traffic car and not a box truck hitting you and throwing you off the road for no reason. Traffic in racing games is cancer, you companies know players don't want it you're not a cruising game you're a racing game so get rid of it. Street racing is illegal and immoral stop promoting it with traffic and remove it and make it legal.Test drive durations need to be longer you barely get any time to push a hypercar to its limits and get to understand the vehicle, you need to make it to where all cars including motorpass and summitlive cars can be bought with ingame currency at a higher price than normal because you know you have cheaters and exploiters and they continue to harass the community and deny good skilled drivers cool cars just because you had to put a stupid PVP system that is entirely dumb and should be removed and cheaters and exploiters don't get punished or can be even reported. The interior dash of some cars is completely horrid even on high graphics, i've seen much better from forza horizon 1 and car mods from Garry's Mod it's 2023 fix your stuff there is no excuse for this live service sorry excuse for a game to not be updated and upgraded to such standards. Do not buy this game if you are looking for a social open world experience, just like forza horizon it is anti-social full of pause menu abusers and very dead plus it has a stupid player collision system so others can abuse it and ram because for some reason we don't get that no one wants that in freemode leave it to demo derby. The car tuning window is completely useless with really dumb + or - rather than explaining what the setting does leaving you to have to experiment to figure it out resulting in some cars never being good because no one can figure out how to tune them and even if you do the handling system is so horrid it doesnt really matter at all. Asides that absolutely love the ability to switch to different vehicles on the fly using the favorite system, the game is somewhat beautiful to a degree but it's all ruined by having nothing to do and the races being all the same. It is also ruined by never being able to compete in summitlive or getting on the icon leaderboard because it is dominated by cheaters and exploiters, i really think summit live needs to be removed along with the dumb motorpass and icon leaderboard you've let hackers and exploiters dominate your game and it's ridiculous all PVP is entirely ruined.",1675916350,1690752129,False,1,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

There are so many different styles of racing in this game and each one has it's own 'feeling' that makes it stand out and all of them are at least somewhat okay once you get the hang of them. Something I really liked about the way they handled all of this is that the cars you get are all very good without you even needing to spend in-game currency on any unless you choose to and for a few event types (primarily the police chase ones), which means you can just have fun instead of needing to ever grind aside if you have a personal preference for a car you'd like and want to drive in.

While the main game of just doing all the styles of instanced races is fun, one of my favorite things in this are the 'stories' which are just long road trips from point-to-point all across America. You get rewarded with loads of fans from everything along the drive and ultimately a new vehicle by the end, but this is one of those rare times the bland and overused adage of ""it's about the journey not the destination"" is totally true. There's something just nice, fun, and relaxing about going on solo road trips around the country at 300mph.

I like it, it's not the best driving or racing game out there - but it makes up for it in having so much to do in so many different ways, such a big map, and other players interacting outside of events in short fleeting moments like impromptu police chases or motorcycle races.",1690497336,1690497336,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Good variety of vehicles at your disposal to keep thing interesting, and community downloads for decals are godsent.

Would like to have seen more customization options on the body part side of things, but this will hopefully be addressed in the upcoming entry into the series.

Sth even worse: you have to install some intrusive ubisoft program shlt to play the game. I think Valve should have a policy against that. If you want to sell your shlt on Steam, just do so. If you want to force buyers to install additional front ends, just f-off. That should not be allowed. The steam front end is more than enough.

And the worst of all, it is an online only game. Wtf? 
That should be clearly advertised on the game page, ´´Attention, this is an online game´´, so that people could stay safely away from this shlt.

Tried mostly everything in game that i am interested in (so basically anything that involves wheels on the ground)(the flying and driving on the water is atrocious IMO), and it kinda has the same problem forza horizon has where there is just no sense of progression.
The car you can buy are cheap enough to immediately just complete any normal event you can do and from every race you finish in the top 3 you get loot which immediately improves your car for that discipline and therefor immediately propels you forward even further making this game only challenging when you repeat events on higher difficulties.
Which is another point on contention because you cant choose higher difficulties for the events untill you completed the previous difficulty (really stupid decision to be honest).

There is an absolute metric fuckton of shit to do in this game also due to its almost battlepas like setup with daily quests and monthly goals and all that BS, but i personally have found none of it upto to this point any type of interesting beyond the cannonball like events because i like to just space out and drive while listening to music.
The stories are just single events with no NPCs beyond the police events which are glorified burnout (the game) events that are extremely trivial to anyone who enjoys racing games fairly regularly.
That or just a small piece of text about someones travels through america and you get to drive to some of the points of interest by yourself and have to find those points yourself which can get really annoying when the clouds show back up on the map when you zoom in...

Did some of the flying and boating events in the beta and never looked back, just atrocious as i mentioned above.

i'll give it some more hours, try and look for events with actual NPCs in them even though the small amount i have done the AI is also atrocious.

In short, if youre looking for a casual racing game that doesnt require you to setup your wheel and just go in and have some fun, this honestly aint it.

I will never buy another one of these stupid games that requires you to use their version of Steam through Steam; either offer it on Steam or don't, but stop making Steam go through your launcher!

First and foremost with this game is expectations.  This is not by any means a racing simulator; it is more realistic than Star Wars racing, but only just.  It is an arcade race game, and a really good one at that!  Just don't be surprised when nothing is remotely realistic, except the graphics, which are great. As a private pilot who used to own an acrobatic rated plane, flying is by far the least realistic, which at first was frustrating, but eventually I learned to just accept it as a fun parody of flying.  Motorcycles are given no justice here; they actually turn worse than cars, which is totally backwards!  Of course in the real world cars cannot compete with motorcycles, so motorcycles had to be ""dumbed down"" to make them equal in the game.  Hovercraft seem to be the most realistic, interestingly, but all of classes of vehicle are totally unrealistic.  So, if you are looking for hyper realistic physics and realistic controls, this is not the game for you; however, this game is fun and easy to get straight into racing with little to no set up or ""training"".

The good:  Lots of fun, lots of variety of racing, and an open world, semi based on the USA.  I love all the real world cars, planes, and boats; even if none of them are realistic performance wise at all.

The bad:  the events are not well balanced.  The street racing discipline takes up like 1/4 of the game!  Or, so it feels.  By the time you finish all Street Races on easy, you have multiple fully upgraded cars in that class.  Then, you have multiple classes where you have to repeat levels over and over on easy, just to make bare minimum performance recommendations.  Not a deal breaker, just a little odd.  It would flow better if there were more of the other events, as they tend to be a bit more ""grindy"".

The biggest bad is the multi player system.  Having random players get in the way while you are doing the same event can be really annoying.  Especially in the weekly Live Summit events; where I have literally had to endure someone parking a monster truck between the edges of a checkpoint, so no one could do well in that challenge.   That was VERY annoying!  Another common problem is other random people also doing the same timed event who are slower than you; now you either wait for a clear chance, or just do your best getting around them in the middle of a scored event.  Ability to race real people, good; real people getting in the way of your single player skill challenges, bad.

Next, the Ubisoft launcher sucks and it can be a major PIA just to get the game to actually start most of the time.  Some times it just flat out refuses to let you on and play, even if you only want to play solo.  Just expect that it will usually take 5 - 15min to actually get the game running, and sometimes it won't let you play for a while.

The world:  The game marketing makes a huge deal of having the entire USA open world to drive, fly, and boat around.  Well, that isn't accurate at all.  From coast to coast is like 50miles and can be driven in about 20 minutes.  It is more a bunch of parts of the country cookie cuttered out and put in roughly the correct places, just with a whole lot less real estate between ""cookies"".  It's kind of cool that you can drive from Seattle to New York, and you will pass through several familiar places, or many other places.  The cities that it includes are pretty good representations; however, what cities and places they decided to include and not include is very random and odd.  I get the feeling the developers are based on the East Coast, as they have the California central valley a lush forest.  Anyone who has ever been anywhere in the California central  valley knows it is a brown ""grass"" grassland on the verge of being desert!  It's also funny they didn't include any differential weather, so yes it snows in Miami!  Over all the playing world is a little funky, but great.

Realistic: not a bit.  Fun: absolutely.",1619416262,1689820647,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

* Regular server down times, and the game is online only. 
* AI is riddled with hack'arounds and does not feel like it's actually simulated. It is rubber banding in some situations and is completely useless in others. Bosses rubber band and cheat like crazy. Same when AI is closer to your car's performance level. Once you increase your car's performance index, AI disappears, sometimes several minutes behind.
* Physics engine is quite bad. Might something to do with the fact that they have to have planes, boats, monster trucks, hovercrafts and bikes, and all of them are absolutely terrible to drive.

* Tons of content
* Can buy premium season content with in-game money
* Good car selection and customization

on the positives, 
-there's a lot of cool vehicles in the game and a few strange choices. which I always appreciate. even the legendary Gee-Bee.
-Lot of variety. Drifting, offroad, air races, etc. hard to get tired of the variety
-The map is huge. Yeah it's a very strange version of the US but it's sheer size is incredible. 

my negatives
-Controls REALLY suck, you have to level up to unlock the ability to tune cars more in-depth. without turning off assists and such they just understeer heavily. E-brake really doesn't let you slide and without tuning some cars are absolute slogs to drive. other vehicles like the hovercraft and even off road vehicles feel fine. planes are okay. 
-Lack of speed. 240mph does not feel like any speed. 
-Battlepass, bundle content, premium coins, etc are constantly there. 
-Game can be ridiculously easy when doing an event for the first time due to upgrades or just the first go through at the lowest difficulty can be a cakewalk
-Lack of any real narrative, it just feels like cut scenes happen, people talk with no rhyme or reason. and man I hate all these people. everyone minus a few are these ""yeah bro lets go WIN and do the sick jump!"" dudebro or dude lady. the only character that feels any different is clarance and he feels like an AI speech bot talking to me. And the writing is atrocious at times. ""you can win races but you'll never win the race"" is a real line in this game. It's just. ugh I hate this style of writing in horizon and I hate these type of characters. I hate racing games trying to have a crappy story and characters. I'd rather no one talk to me then whatever dialouge happens here.
-Air racing isn't air racing. It's just time trials. no actual opponents. this kinda sucks. I still enjoy it but it's Air RACING not air trials. 
-no real evolution or actual ""career"" just grind credit to buy cars or randomly get them. it doesn't feel like I'm being a famous ""pilot"" there's really no cutscenes or anything that forms a world or anything. Grid 1 had your race shop grow and become more professional. this game has your house get nicer and that's really the only indication your getting more famous.

I could probably nit pick more complaints. wish I could rate this mid but I'll give it a positive review. it goes on sale very often for a couple of bucks and I got hours out of it. Season pass is not worth full price. probably on sale though. you can have some fun with it and it's nice to just drive or fly. Just wish the handling was better and the game didn't have annoying characters that make me wish I was wolfgang von trips at the monza grand prix in 1961",1689739025,1689739025,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-Forza + ขับรถในอเมริกา  + เรือ+เครื่องบิน+มอไซร+ดีเทลสิ่งแวดล้อมเยอะกว่า+สนามแข่งมากกว่า และเยอะกว่า
-เกมขับรถ แนวอาเขต ที่มี Gameplay รวมทุกเกมเข้ามาไว้ในเกมเดียว     
-ชอบขับรถแบบ NFS,Forza  แต่อยากปรับแต่งแบบน้องๆ Forza หรือไม่ต้องจูนมาก   และมีสนามแข่งและ map ใหญ่ๆ  เกมนี้ตอบโจทย์เลย 

ข้อด้อย
-แบรนด์รถไม่เยอะเท่า Forza  ,จูนรถง่ายกว่า Forza ,ต้องเก็บพารท์แบบสุ่มจากการแข่ง แทนการซื้อของมาแต่งแบบ Forza
ระบบ physic ของการแต่งรถ ที่กระทำต่อสนาม  น้อยกว่าเกม Forza ทำให้เกมนี้ดูเล่นง่ายกว่า

-เน้นขับรถแบบสมจริง  ข้ามเกมนี้ไปได้เลย

The core racing experience is fun, and the open-world is still a thrill to just fly, race and drift around. However, there are definitely some irks that hold it back.

The Crew 2 was designed to be far more ambitious in it's storytelling. The cutscenes and dialogue you get occasionally before or after a race feel really disjointed, as if there's a big chunk of the story you missed somewhere.

Also, what's the point of having a house or garage in this game if you can't even do nothing with it yet? Can't customize it, can't have people over, can't do jack squatty. Seems like some lazy backwards logic by the devs if you ask me.
In this game it's just the same thing over and over again, race after race against the AI with no variation in gameplay other than the fact you have planes and boats now. One big long grind to get better parts for your vehicles.

This game is max quantity, zero quality. If you told me this game was designed by people who had never actually driven or sat in a car and everything they knew about driving was through bing searches and 80's action movies, it would all make sense. Then they added rpg elements with based loot. This is a parody of a driving game through the lens of the onion.

And the worst part: Why on earth you lost the license for Subaru? Literally the only brand that would make me still play this game.",1689529191,1689529191,False,2,0,0.528023600578308105,0,True,False,False

This review would probably be a lot more favorable if I got this game when it came out 5 years ago, but it really shows its age now.
 
As an Arcade racer it's fine, but the upgrade system is atrocious. ""Loot"" for Upgrades is probably the worst thing I've ever seen in a racing game. 

Graphics are only okay when in an actual race. the Cinematics are pre-rendered and looks horrific at anything higher than 720P resolution. Driving in the open world isn't great, even with max settings and motion Blur off, it feels like I'm in a much older game, I had to stop driving in the over world due to it making me a bit nauseous with how bad the Loading Distance, weird tearing, overall low fidelity.  

The AI's you race against are pretty sad as well, I can consistently go into races that I'm supposedly under powered for according to the ""perf"" stat. But the AI is so bad, that I can easily beat them in most races, which results in a overall boring race experience. 

I do love the Hot Pursuit mode, those little races are far better than the entire Citroen remake that ruined NFS: Hot Pursuit for me.

Overall, it feels like this was a racing game first, then Horizon did really well so they shoe-horned as much content in as possible to compete with it. I do think it was ambitious but a lot of the aspects just don't feel great. Everything feels like it's driving on rails... doesn't matter if you're in a hyper car, off road truck, the badly named ""watercraft mk 1"", or one of the racing planes... they all have the same feel. If the game is on sale for $10 for the Gold Edition, I'd say it's worth it. Otherwise, wait for it to go on sale.",1689291330,1689291330,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

CONS
- The overall physics and effects make it look like ""Mobile Game - Asphalt 9""
- Heavy car drifting on mixed surfaces at 200 kmph without any sense of friction. Cars basically slide on roads.
- You may think Crew 2 is open world arcade racer but in reality, the arcadiness is beyond everything.

PROS
- extremely huge open world giving tons and tons of different types of races and stuff.
- very cheap price (90% off) and so much to explore 
- you can drive boats, planes, bikes and cars


Verdict - Game is nice and comes on superb sale but it's too much grind and game feels like poor budget from ubisoft. If you don't have NFS or Forza, then Crew is good title.

But holy shit does this take the cake. How is it possible to take a simple concept as a racing game and make everything wrong about it. The handling? Is shit. The physics? Is shit. The gameplay? is shit. The sound design? Is shit. The storyline, characters, atmosphere, and literally the entire game? Is shit.

Nah, don't buy this game even on sale. Because you don't actually buy a game, you own an access to the game. What do you mean? Oh I don't know, maybe because your save file is tied to the in-game servers and you have no way of restarting your progress unless you buy a new copy? But why does it matter? Oh I don't know, maybe because if servers gets shut down you will be left with a skeleton copy of a game that you cannot play? Does that make an owner of the game copy or owner of the game access? Because that just sounds to me like a free to play game with added fee to it.

Graphics are utter garbage. And it's a nice way of putting it. Draw distance is way too close and you can't make out what is happening in front of you. IN FRONT OF YOU IN A RACING GAME. (Ultra settings btw). The lighting system doesn't work. So your headlights do not light up the road in front of you... IN A RACING GAME WHERE YOU NEED TO SEE THE ROAD.

The physics and controls are arcade style. So I let that pass. But if you come from NFS, Forza or Dirt background... Well it will feel like none of those games would feel close. It has it's own sluggishness attached to it. There's also lootboxes for car upgrades. Why? What's wrong with tier upgrade system to put every car on par and balance each car to be equal? Actually don't say it - Microtransactions.

Oh and story? Yeah it has nothing to do with The Crew 1. You are basically playing as an obnoxious streamer. I guess it was hip to make games about streamers back in 2018.

And even the sound mixing is garbage. How do you screw up something as basic as hearing the sounds? Was this mixed by a deaf person? The engine sound is too quiet, the FX and Voice Acting is too loud. And if you increase volume, the menu sounds bangs your eardrums. It's all over the place.

But, I will be nice to the game and give credit where it's due. I like soundtrack. That's it.

So if you read this review, think for a moment, do you really want to buy a game that one day the servers will shut down which lock you out of playing a subpar game? A game with 0 replayability because your savefile is tied to your account with no options of resetting the progress? Yeah, I thought so too.",1689001104,1689001104,False,10,3,0.597634613513946533,1,True,False,False

I wouldn't have bought this game but horizon 5 and its drip fed content ended my patience for that franchise so while waiting and hoping for solar crown to not shit the bed I found this on sale, and I have to say, it won me over.

The races are fun, the variety is cool, the airplanes and boats are gimmicks, yes, but they play okay (no stall manouvers on aerobatics do annoy me tho), it's an activity to do if you need a break, there are bikes, touring cars, rally cars, trucks, monster trucks, bikes, offroad bikes, open wheel racers..
The environment is quite a joy to explore, there is quite a bit of content and I haven't even unlocked the summit yet.

My only complaint is the progression, the crew 1 was a slow burn, it felt rewarding having to take a road trip and drive for some time to get to a new city, then doing the events there, then hitting the road again..slowly giving you the cars and upgrades, some races were very long, crossing multiple states and I miss that, here, fast travel to any event without cost is available from the game start and the progression feels a little too effortless and meaningless to be rewarding for me, it's one of those loot mmo progression systems that does not fit the racing genre well but devs insist on it for some reason, grinding a 4 minute race to fit a legendary ""motorcore"" (which sounds like a heavy metal genre) loot part, then rerolling it's attributes, I wish they kept to the first game's progression but made it a little bit faster instead.

But honestly, with horizon 5 and the state it's in, I'll stick to the crew 2, it's simply a better open world racing experience, with NFS completely botching a mild success with unboud and forza becoming more and more greedy, careless and putting zero effort in the franchise, I don't see that changing, the crew 2 will be the better open world racing experience out there for a while, not because it's simply that great of a game, it's not, but with competition like that, might as well be.

First of all, the UI is a jumbled mess. I mean, navigating through cars to buy or to get into is tedious, between races or when you are at a staging area, you slowly stumble along on foot to choose either races, cars or to escape the drudging dull monotony of this mode to freemode in a car. 

It is such a mess that in first play through it took me about 10 mins to figure out how to quit the game. There is two ways I found where you can exit the game. I'll tell you so you'll be able to get outta there without raging and go kill the process in the task manager. The quit options are actually hidden and there's no indication where it is in the game. I've found out that if you are in a race or activity in a car, you must press and hold the Y button on the controller to be able to quit the game. If you are in free mode, either in car or on foot, the exit option is hidden on the far right of the settings menu. You actually have to scroll the menu sideways to the right to be able to see it. Pressing start and having a simple pause menu where you can load, save and quit (Like the majority of games out there) would be far too logical. No! You're stuck here bro until you figure this out. 

Also, don't ever and I mean EVER follow the GPS arrows on the screen that tells you where to go. It tries to take you everywhere and anywhere but on the road (I was in an off road vehicle). That in itself wouldn't be all that bad, off roading through the world could be fun, but the thing is taking you through places where it is IMPOSSIBLE to get out of. Usually you would just have to use the really helpful ''Reset Car'' option (You have to press and hold both Shoulder Buttons) but it just reset your car 5 feet behind IN THE SAME HOLE YOU CAN'T GET OUT OF. I was in the grand canyon, so it might be less of a problem elsewhere, but then again, I don't want to find out. My last play through I got stuck again so I just quit the game, with the really helpful Y button menu. 

All that being said, the driving simulation is competent. The activities sound compelling. And the story missions entertaining. 

As for performance and visuals, there are better options out there (Like Forza Horizon 5). I run the game at 4K resolution HIGH settings on a AMD Ryzen 9 5900x 12 cores 24 threads with 32gigs of high speed DDR5 memory with a RTX 3070Ti and FH5 runs way smoother and looks better at 4K resolution. 

Now I've bought the game on sale at 90% discount. So I got the full deluxe edition for 12$ so the disappointment doesn't hurt as much as if I had paid the full 120$ full price for this. Even at that price, if you crave for a GREAT racing game, throw 10$ on a XBOX game pass and play Horizon 5.",1688877735,1688877925,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I played the original game on Xbox back in the day. I was looking for much the same thing when I picked up The Crew 2 on sale and it mostly delivered.

Coming into the game 5 years after release, I was completely overwhelmed by the amount of content that was available to me. The lacklustre tutorial left me confused, not knowing what events to do, or which ones were the main campaign and which were added content. However, once I had figured things out, I loved the vast amount of content.

The driving physics leave a lot to be desired. The Crew 2 is clearly an arcade racer, however this is no excuse for physics which are undoubtedly worse than 15 year old Forza games. The lack of realistic physics makes driving skill less important, instead placing more importance on the perf level of your car.

The difficulty of races is solely determined by the recommended perf level that your car should have. This makes the difficulty rather binary: if your car meets the perf level, the races are easy; if it doesn't, they are hard. This, coupled with the physics, makes progression in the game less of an investment of skill, and more of an investment of time. The weak story reduces the motivation to progress.

The cars are expensive, requiring a significant grind to afford them. With 16 different disciplines (vehicle types), the game is very varied, making the grind interesting, and giving the player lots of vehicles to buy. With the variation of the map, it becomes easy to spend hour doing events that all feel very different from each other.

Roaming around and completing events with friends is really fun. Showing off the vehicle you've been grinding for is rewarding. I believe the game becomes better when playing with other people. The GTAO-style open world roaming allows you to meet new people - who you can add to your crew to play events together,

I was extremely surprised to discover that this 5 year old game is still updated to this day. The weekly Summit adds competitive challenges with good rewards. The Motorpass adds more things to grind for, and the Motorflix events adds more content to the game. Just recently, a race creator was added: I am impressed by this so far but we will see how it develops. With the upcoming release of The Crew Motorfest, the updates are likely to slow, or even stop, which is slightly disappointing.

Some features of The Crew that I was looking for in The Crew 2 that were not present are:
- Linear progression system
- Using one car across multiple specs

Despite all of the negatives, The Crew 2 is an extremely enjoyable game, that makes me keep coming back for more with its varied content. I would definitely recommend picking this up on sale: paying full price is not worth it.",1688641785,1688641785,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Driving feels bad. 
- Physics feel very simple, the controls are sluggish, and the camera is terrible. 
- Vehicles handle very differently in game compared to the trailers and screenshots on the store page. 4 wheeled vehicles in particular feel like balloons hovering over the ground with locked rotational axes. 
- Vehicles felt very much the same within types, among the ones I tried.
- Gameplay definitely feels like it was not a priority.
- NPCs often annoy you while driving. 
- Cringe ego pandering. Anything you do seems to warrant brown nosing from NPCs and gain hundreds of followers on fake social media.

I got the gold edition on sales ($13.50 CAD)
It was worth it
If you are going to buy it, buy the deluxe or gold edition as it gives you a huge head start.
The map is HUGE
HUGE vehicle selection
Realistic graphics and audio
Friendly community
Would recommend a decent system on this game if you want to play on ultra settings
Would recommend a good steering wheel
(""I find $111 CAD for the gold edition too much because you can get multiple different games so just wait for the steam sales event"")

I recently bought a new top tier PC and unlocked the graphics' full potential. For the record, I returned before getting my new rig. BUT!!! The MOST important thing about this game is that the developers KEEP IT COMING!!!! SO MUCH (BEYOND FATHOMABLE) NEW CONTENT THAT WAS INTRODUCED THROUGHOUT THE YEARS- EVEN AFTER A NEW CREW GAME WAS ANNOUNCED. and GOOD and FUN content too! Very diverse, much adrenaline fun.

**Even kind of a ""story"" was added to the game, like a flash of what would be a plot- Not much but it DOES add some soul to the game. Always room to improve.

ORIGINAL: Bottom line is, this is a good racing game, stands out well in the crowd comparing today's selection of racing games. plenty of things to do, fun to drive. i guess at some point after doing all the initial content the game had to offer before all the updates that came along the way, i lost interest (but only eventually! but still had plenty of fun in this game.)

if i have a friend who usually dislikes racing games who enjoyed this i can tell you it's fun. they keep making content, so i'd say, it's a good thing. so i give it a thumbs up, even though i barely play anymore tbh. i sometimes come back for a couple and then quit. but the game i always come back to is midnight club 2. sometimes even underground. so you can see why people with my kind of taste for racing games would like this.

P.S. at +400km/h you feel the speed, MAN that feels good in this game!!
i just wish this game had SOME story to it... i get the point that the game is trying to get the player to feel, that you enter a world that is basically just a huge playground (size of a mini usa, but huge map still) that you enter to race ANY type of vehicle out there except trains probably, but still.. i always love the story that drives heat through your veins to race like hell and.. there is just this ""have fun racing any kind of vehicle you can think of"" which is lacking that heat.. but on that any type of vehicle i mean, they had freakin hovercrafts, now we got some sportbikes... it's a fun game.",1593206565,1688412129,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I prefer games like F1 or Motorsport and was after something with a similar driving experience but this game was not what I was looking for.

- Decent sense of speed
- Player sync seems okay (other than bikes)

Con's - Game doesn't know what it is
- Drift mode is trash
- Drag mode is trash
- Touring mode is now trash with recent physics changes
- Planes are trash with trash controls
- Boat control is trash and slow
- Parts system is trash and annoying
- Traffic is trash and annoying
- Animals are trash and annoying
- Lot's of ruined first person views (poor gauge placement)
- Motorcycle player sync is trash (as soon as you wheelie other players see you upside down)
- Races are too short for an entire map of the USA (should be more coast to coast 1 hour races)

Conclusion:
Game had massive potential, but unfortunately falls short trying to do everything instead of doing 1-2 things well.

Whoever is in charge of 'testing' and 'physics' got paid too much.

I could have made this game better than Forza with a few simple changes.

Update (07.04.2021) - Slightly closer to endgame now.

Update (22.02.2022) - Finally reached Icon 9999 at 3060 hours played. Full review below.

While my interest in the game has deteriorated over the years as the more you progress, the less there is to do, I still find personal objectives for myself to progress towards - hunt certain performance part sets or get certain statistic to higher milestone or improve my times on leaderboards - there is a lot to do in The Crew 2. Doesn't matter if you are just starting out or you have played for 50 hours already.

Negatives:

- The game is very grindy and there is barely any story at all
- There is a lot of time-gated (timed exclusives) content
- Quality of Life is completely out of balance (some vehicle categories are well balanced while others have 3 vehicles that dominate out of a group of 30)
- there are boosted sets that dominate leaderboards with only a limited number of players having access to them
- lack of crossplay
- unoptimized game performance can make the game crash even on more powerful systems.
- As the game is always online and mostly on the server side, there is no modding community for it and players have to put faith into devs and Ubisoft, who, honestly speaking, have been milking players for over a year now.

However, there are great parts to The Crew 2 that make the game better for me than other rivals:

- Game offers a vast open world, biggest in a current-gen racing game (though it was released during PS4/XB1 era, the game is a bit too big for those consoles and players suffer from poor performance and lengthy loading times).
- A wide variety of different types of vehicles to play with, learn and master (and collect), not just limiting to cars, but also bikes, boats, planes and hovercraft.
- An enormous amount of different activities, with new types having been added over the years.
- Excellent arcade-ish handling model, works amazing with a controller, but keyboard is great as well. Funnily enough, the actual meta is wheel... in an arcade game.
- Working PVP system, albeit its a bit too simplistic, offers no customization and suffers from bad rewards (PvE is better way to grind for rewards), yet people continue to play it and populate lobbies.
- High level of visual modification for most car/bike vehicle classes. As is standard these days, player populated vehicle livery system is present, where players can use in-game livery editor to make designs for all vehicle types.
- You can drift in this game. It has an entire category focused on drifting.
- Demolition Derby with destructible cars is also a thing.
- The Crew is a GaaS (Game-as-a-Service), which means that it is being continuously updated. Fortunately, all the new cars (non time-gated ones) and events and QoL updates have been completely for free. After buying the game, the only things that require premium currency are vanity items (nitrous, tyres, underglows, rooftops, horns, window tints etc) and there being very few opportunities in the game to receive premium currency, forcing players to put more money into the game.
EDIT as of late 2022 - Motorpass can now be purchased with in-game bucks, premium currency spending is no longer required.
- Leaderboards for every type of activity keep the grinding process engaging, as you can keep on improving yourself on leaderboards, while getting followers (XP), money and other resources.
- Hobbies (accolade system) makes you constantly feel like progressing in the game, no matter what the activity is. More frequently early on, less frequently later in the game.
- Having an insanely high account level cap (Icon 9999, took me over 3000 hours to reach it) means that you are constantly gaining XP and levelling up. You can use these levels to improve various passive stats (Nitro is more powerful, earn more bucks per race etc).
- There are a lot of other great things in the game, the list would be too long.
- EDIT July 2023 - Track Creator has been added to the game, removing it from negatives listing and adding it to positives. Feature looks to be very robust and offers a lot of creative applications for the players on the biggest map in a current-gen racing game.

There are also a few grey areas to mention that I cannot really put into good or bad:

- While the game does not have an implementation of cops, there are game modes where you use ""pursuit"" vehicles to destroy destructible AI vehicles. It kind of works out like the ""Road Rage"" mode in Burnout Paradise. You can play this game mode with friends and smash AI in co-op fashion.
- The Crew 2 has an in-game video editor. I have not really seen a lot of player implementations of it and honestly, most people do not even know it exists. 
- PC version has a chat system, which seems to be mostly utilized in PVP. It was used more in The Crew 1 and in the early days of The Crew 2, but in later years, most new players do not know it exists. People use the emote system instead.

I think that is my review. While this is my most played game on Steam and most streamed game on Twitch, it is not the best game I have ever played. It has its flaws and lack of exciting new content and progressive Quality of Life implementation has left a sour taste in the mouth for most veteran players. We hope the publishers still see potential for this game and allow developers to move the game onto a better path, which it deserves. It was great once, it can be great again.

My score for an experience of playing The Crew 2 over 3.5 years = 8.5/10.",1590098525,1688065675,True,6,8,0.587469816207885742,0,True,False,False

People complain about the Crew 2 but i think its for the wrong reasons; most of the critism is about the grindy aspect of this game and yes they are right it indeed is one of the grindiest racing games ever but to be absolutely honest.. i bought a racing game to win races, if the grind is based on racing then why would i complain? anyways, theres seemingly endless content to be played, most of it feels either the same or really really alike but i really appreciate the cheer amount of content Ivory Tower came up with, set peaces and special events really look and feel cool to go through but it is obvious that most of it were simple instagram filters being put onto your screen to make it feel different even if it mostly isn't.

Graphics are OKAY, it does look outdated compared to even older titles and the antialasing is basically non existent, the backmirrors do not work and your headlights are literally looking like transparent yellow JPGs to make it look like there was light but it actually is no light source at all inside the game engine, the steering wheel barely moves at higher speeds. It definetily has its moments though, it can look pretty and sometimes i had more NFS Underground Vibes than the past 5 Need for Speeds were able to get me but the fact the night time got literally massacred in order to cover up non functioning headlights really bothers me

Heres what i think is important to know before getting into it
Anything you do, wether it be menu navigation or real time gameplay, it feels like a mobile game with PC features. Theres so many decisions made in design which simply go all against the user experience to make it as annyoing and uncomfortable as possible and i will have to give you a couple examples to make some sense of what i actually mean: 

Every time you finish a race theres an unskippable animation playing telling you that you won, how much XP you got and how much money you earned, it takes almost 10 seconds every single time, right after that you'll see some funny colorfull packages spawning in front of your car so you collect them, these are literally random generated tuning parts which also have (feelingly) hundreds of additional passive effects besides pushing the cars perfomance. Once your inventory is full and you tuned up your car, you gotta dismantle the stuff you don't need and that.. takes way too much time. I could guess that 1/3 of my playtime was dismantling tuning parts only.
This entire process is what you get for playing the game. The Tuning is based on RPG NUMBERS and STATS, its no new super duper new engine you build into your car, its literally the same thing now being purple instead of blue (rarity=quality) and the number goes up from 245 to 247. 
Other than that the Visual Freedom of your car is astonishingly huge, less for the GT and Hyper Classes but more than ever in street race cars, generally the car selection is almost as impressive as Forzas is.

The AI in your races also base their difficulty on those RPG like ""Perfomance Numbers"", meaning your car has to have a ""220-Stat"" to be able to compete in that specific race; this system leads to the AI being either entirely broken or not existent at all. One side of the game makes you want to own as many cars and have as much variety as possible, on the other side theres really obvious differences in cars in same classes. Almost every Muscle Car feels underpowered as hell while other ""meta-cars"" will have no problems whatsoever; Some cars really do struggle a ton to keep up with the AI, others will make you simply drive the course to the finish line making it a personal time trial.

But wait! theres more! The Crew 2 has an RPG like Skill Tree. It enhanced passive things like ""slipstream power"", range, effectiveness, it enhanced your nitrous in 7 different ways and makes competing against other lower level people a joke; actually the PVP section of this game is dead since release because of the slipstream mechanic which is absolute BS, you can literally hear your car gaining +100HP as you drive behind your mate. This is a racing game, no MMORPG and most certainly no MOBA, i genuinenly do not understand how one could implement such things into a racing game, making a skill set almost obsolete (of course you still have to know how to drive lol)

Also, there is an ingame real-money shop for you to buy cosmetics, car bundles and battle pass though you can buy the battle pass with ingame money you get from playing

On the plus side though, i really like how easy accessable the multiplayer is. You invite your friend to the party, you choose a race and there you go, no overcomplicated crap needed for this.

I love playing this game but i seriously hate everything that comes with it.

UPDATE: Last week an item disappeared from my summit rewards, I was careful not to lose any unmarked boosted loot and checked every piece one by one, and yet an item has disappeared. It seems entirely evident that Ubisoft support is not run by humans. The responses are either just scanned by a bot and replied with keyword based responses, or they are the most idiotic and/or broken English users to ever grace this planet. It takes weeks to months to get a broken reply, good luck if you have an actual problem which you're likely to run into with this garbage company.

I can only imagine The Crew: Motorfest being plastered with reused assets including the user interface (which appeared in the BETA.) The UI is absolute garbage in TC2, so why would they reuse it in Motorfest? Gosh, it's absolutely appalling how poorly this company runs its own franchises into the ground.

PvP is unbalanced dog shit: We have the issue in PvP of people using manual driving to go faster so automatic drivers literally can't maintain the same or similar speed unless slip streaming. The gears often don't even work properly unless you use non-sequential gearbox, with some cars not switching quickly enough, partly because of this problem people use third party programs to get gears to work on a joystick because Ubisoft couldn't be bothered to implement it themselves. PvP is just following the manual driver's slipstream, and if you make one mistake you are almost guaranteed to lose the race. It's not just their steering that's winning the race, it's the gear changing increase in speed. The auto gearbox lags extremely badly, you can be stuck on a gear for seconds before it changes, losing so much potential power output. Also, if you are further from the server people are able to slip stream off you end race and still win, even if they are behind you because the server counts total time, not race position. If you are delayed by any ping you have a disadvantage because your slip stream is free to use. You'll try to use your slipstream strategically and wait for them to go ahead, then slip stream off them, pass them over the line and lose. They will slip stream off you, and either pass you or not and you will lose, so you're fucked trying to choose when to boost because you're giving them free slipstream no matter what. The game is fucked.

It could have been fun to have an automatic only lobby so people didn't have to dick around with trying to get gears to work correctly in this fucking horrible let down of a game.

Sure, I have plenty of hours, but it was just turned to bullshit when I started PvP, the game is broken. I wasn't bad either, I got world top 100 times in some tracks, PvP was just erratic and almost no one played because they hid it speed within the terrible menus somewhere, fuck knows where it is, I just go to a tent in a HQ.

The game was fun, for a while, but it's buggy and Ubisoft are disgusting and obnoxious. Avoid the forums and their website because it's trash; oversized with massive ignorance, arrogance and censorship nonsense. Don't buy the Season pass, it just floods your game with unearned cars, yuk.

Hello Ubisoft staff member,

I uploaded this video of the problem and managed to capture it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ja_HmvPjdrs&t=191s

I captured this because it kept happening to me and I know I had to spend over 200K worth of scrap to correct the issue for the Summit and it has left a sour taste in my mouth. This happened many times and multiple times on the same loot for the perfect 10% Points rolls. I was sitting there repeatedly pressing it and I was a bit delirious from all the time I spent trying to earn the BMW.

I sat here for days farming loot for this and lost a substantial chunk of Bucks and Scrap. The problems would have caused a few million bucks worth and a LOT of scrap, not only in the broken items, but the time and energy to try work around this problem and nearly missed out on the BMW.

I am really quite upset and hoping someone can look into this and help me out please. :(

Thank you so much! :)

And the idiots replied like this:

Hello Player!

Thank you for contacting Ubisoft Support. I hope you are doing well. My name is Ubi-Caesar and I will be assisting you today with your query.

Upon checking your case, we can temporarily deactivate 2fa for you so that you can login. You can activate it again after you are able to access your account.

When completing a race in The Crew 2, missed or forgotten loot can be found by accessing your mailbox.

You can access the mailbox at any Head Quarters (HQs). The loot in your mailbox will be accessible via the relevant HQs hosting the race, depending on the race you completed.

Please note that if you receive loot while your mailbox is at full capacity, the excess loot will be deleted.

Feel free to ask if you have any other questions!

Warm Regards,
Ubi-Caesar
Ubisoft Support.

Then I decided to post on the forums which was a mistake.

First post was rejected and I was given this warning for posting the conversation with the support member:

""You have received an warning for this post. More specifically for the following reason: *Posting private chat logs in public threads*

Warnings serve as a reminder to you of the forum's rules, which you are expected to understand and follow.

All the best.""
------------------------------------------------------------
So I corrected it to follow the rules and it was accepted by one moderator then, then removed by another.

This topic has been deleted. Only users with topic management privileges can see it. ""UbiChrisMANG""

You idiots said your support chat would open at 12am and finish at 2am. I waited and it was unavailable.

The game also doesn't explain anything from start to finish, hides chat functions, uses uncommon words like ""affix"" for no reason apart from pomposity and just leaves you baffled till you finally figure yourself out. Also, some purchases are blanked out and it won't explain why, you just have to figure that out yourself.

Get stuffed Ubisoft, why would you treat a customer like this? Your customer support is dog crap.

Well, the latter was correct. I really don't like the non-driving events.
But everything else was pretty good! The driving physics are honestly pretty rough, especially early on, but I got used to them really easily and I feel like this game offers a lot of fun that Forza can't. I like how cars being locked to their own event categories forces you to not use the same car again and again. It's a very good game that runs pretty well and I enjoyed my time.

The Crew 2 is the first racing game I ever got into, and I genuinely was excited to get it. I was just as excited and having fun playing it as well. I haven't played since August of last year, however, that's due to my transition to the Forza series. I wanted to try something new. 

Nonetheless, The Crew 2 has a special place in my heart and I will keep coming back to it no matter what. I enjoyed this game a LOT, especially in 2021. Before I get to the pros of the game, I'd like to quickly talk about the cons so that it's out of the way and you're aware of those first: 

The Detail: 

Compared to Forza Horizon 5, the latest Forza game in the franchise, The Crew 2 isn't as detailed when it comes to map design. The buildings and set pieces can be rather bland at times and cities can feel a bit empty. 
In terms of car detail, it's there but not up to par with Forza. 

Characters: 

The characters are not that important, but I'll say they're not very realistic. I feel that Forza did a better job with character customization options. TC2 isn't that heavy on the character design, so just keep that in mind when you choose your default character. 

Single-player: 

- The Crew 2 is heavy on single-player mode, it's mainly a solo game. Yes, you can play co op, aka with friends, but it's more to explore than to race together. Forza has many multiplayer modes, which allows you to compete with other racers and there are leaderboards. 
But this is a PRO OR CON depending on what you prefer in racing games. If you like exploration and adventurous racing games that are solo, The Crew 2 is the right game for you. 

PROS: 

the map: 

- The map is truly huge and detailed. Although not all the displayed states are in detail (because that would take a hell lot of time), the landmarks and major cities are done properly. As a Floridian, I can confidently say that Miami is pretty accurate! The best part of TC2 is the feeling of driving across the United States. That's what you're paying $60 for. You're essentially travelling to all the major cities, beaches, and bridges by car. It can take you hours to drive through the entire country from one corner to the other; I highly recommend TypicalGamer's TC2 gameplay of driving all around the US. Overall, the map is awesome and you'll find many places to go, you won't run out of curiosity. 

Vehicle Switching: 

- this is one of the BEST features of The Crew 2. You can not only use cars but BOATS and PLANES as well. This provides ample opportunity to explore and feel immersed in the world of TC2. I personally love driving a boat around a city during sunset or sunrise. It's gorgeous and worth taking a good screenshot for. Although planes weren't my thing, it could be fun for other players that enjoy aerobatics. Being able to use cars and bikes is also such a cool feature to have. When I started Forza Horizon 5, I was bummed to find out that bikes weren't a thing. I think this is special to the crew 2 since I played NFS and there weren't any bikes there either. So, the trio vehicles are ultimately a great addition to the game and it feels like you're playing three separate vehicle games at once. 

Grinding: 

- this may be a CON for some players, but to me it's a pro. compared to Forza Horizon 5, it's MUCH harder to get cars in TC2 than in FH5. FH5 is very rewarding, of course, but it can diminish the meaning or satisfaction of getting a car after doing many races. The feeling of accomplishment can feel minimal. So, I like that I had to do many challenges, races, and quests in order to get a pretty good car in TC2. It makes me want to play the game more because of how much I have to do to get a car. It feels more realistic. 

Player Homes: 

- In Forza Horizon 5, the player ""home"" exists and you can purchase different homes other than your default one, but you can't really explore it. You can't go in and customize your car while your character is IN the house. Again, this may not be important to some players, but in TC2 I really liked the idea that my character could be in a 3D space in their house. I could walk around, even run, and change my outfit by just walking to the closet area. This gives me a sense of freedom; I like that I can explore places without using a car all the time. I know that sounds ironic because this IS a racing game, but when there's characters and exploration involved, I think that character mobility adds a nice touch of realism and freedom. 

All in all, The Crew 2 is a vast game of diverse racing opportunities with so much to explore. From hidden easter eggs to story challenges that encourage you to explore more, you'll constantly be driving around getting to know your environment. The customization, map size and landmark details, driving experience, and player mobility all contributes to the great charm of this game. I may be biased since this was my first ever car game, but I truly love it no matter what flaws it has. I genuinely enjoy the endeavor of visiting a state virtually when I can't in real-time.

I dont understand why a game would claim to support wheels when you have to do all kind of backdoor work just to get the wheel to work with basic functionality.. I still dont have a working gear shifter and I still have to use a controller for anything other than gas, brake and steer.. Even then, I must do this little ritual anytime that I want to boot up the game and use my wheel.. This leaves me to favor almost any other game in my list over this one.. I must acknowledge that the majority will not have a wheel and this will not be an issue for them.. It still needs to be said.. 

My other negative about this game is that it is graphically challenged.. In todays market, there are small studios of a few people that put out graphics like this or even better.. The 60hz restriction is also a major drawback given the games poor graphics.. 

I will say that the game runs pretty good unless I try to plug the wheel in.. Without that, the game doesnt have any graphical glitches or freezes that Ive found.. 

If you have a friend or two to play with, That is where this game gets its positive review from.. The fact that its just fun to play with friends.. Of coarse, We avoid the boats and the planes mostly because those were honestly a waist of time putting into the game..  The core system is fun to play and the driving feels good for an arcade racing game.. Leaps and bounds ahead of the most recent NFS games.. In the end of the day, that is the most important aspect to get right.. If the driving sucks, the rest of the game is not fun.. NFS Unbound and Heat are a prime example of that.. 

Bottom line is that the game is worth a purchase if you are a controller user that has a friend to play with.. I would still wait for a good sale before purchasing.. I wouldnt write home about the game and honestly none of these big companies have released GOOD games in recent years.. The fact that this one is just not as bad as the rest is the reason to buy it.. Some guys like me always get that itch for an arcade racer and this is just going to have to do..",1682774570,1685282266,True,1,0,0.522058844566345215,0,True,False,False

So then I played it, loved it and when the game was released on Steam i bought it! But what? When I ""start"" I continued what I've already done in the demo so, the first mission (the unrepeatable by any means tutorial that has the first achievement tied to its completion) is already completed and... I don't have the achievement.
I can't reset my progress because Ubisoft has my saves in cloud blah blah and can't touch them. Even if I ask them to do so, apparently the customer is not to be trusted or listened to.
So, I can't get the stupidest achievement of the whole game because I was so excited for it I DARED TO PLAY THE DEMO. I know ""it's just an achievement"". I paid for this, that includes the achievements and Ubisoft refuses to care.

Though it could be that I'm biased since I had pretty much finished the grind before I quit playing. At the very least there are so many new tracks you shouldn't need to keep rerunning the same ones to get your performance level up.

[b]*Original*[/b]
The Crew 2 has always had some problems, enough I think to deter many players from sticking with it. There were/are reasons to play it but this new Inner Drive update (Patch 1.6.0) makes enjoying the game that much harder.

Most of the problems I have with TC2 predate 1.6, the update just exacerbates them without fixing anything. 1.6 isn't all bad though, here are some things I like about it:
-The UI is better. It's still abysmal but it's better than it was.
-Hypercar offroad speed nerf. (probably a lot of mixed opinions here)
-New content.

Onto the bad; for TC2 as a whole, not just 1.6.
-A lot of the content, especially in 1.6, is premium cosmetics. You can earn CCs (premium currency) by completing daily challenges. I have quite a few tire smokes and underglows without spending any real money. 1.6 just adds more options for nickle and dime tactics.
The weird thing about it is how absolutely awful most cosmetics are. Like these things are bad. This is coming from a guy who puts anime tiddies on his cars. But hey, keep adding more instead of making the game better.
-Missing car brands. This is more a fault of the manufacturers I'm sure but it doesn't change the fact that brands such as Toyota and Subaru are absent. No Supra or Impreza for you.
-The open world isn't used to it's potential, there are a lot of tracks to race on but there are so many more possibilities. It feels like they skimped so as to be able to trickle new tracks every few weeks. There are even ready made locations like the Laguna Seca raceway that just aren't used.
-Tying into that, why is there no custom track editor? If you could make and share your own tracks I would reinstall and recommend this game in a heartbeat.

[b]So this is where it gets really bad.[/b]
-The PVP is an absolute joke. It's not about who is the better driver, it's about who has the better car. If you're both driving the same vehicle then it's about who has the better parts or higher Icon level. It's only about who is better if you're both maxed out really.
The higher your level in the game you can assign more and more points to things that make you catch up to other cars quicker, pull away quicker, your boost lasts longer, boost recharges faster, boost is more powerful, less slowdown offroad, bikes and planes handle better, and the more points you earn in skills.
If you're new, even if we both drive the same clunker, even if I unequip my Nitro Chemist parts, I would crush you on Icon Points alone. It's not a subtle difference. If I kept my max performance and perfectly affixed Nitro Chemist parts on I could probably give you at least a minute long head start and still smoke you.
-The grind is atrocious. Each vehicle type has their own parts which can be shared with other vehicles of the same type (Street Race, Drift, Power Boat, Stunt Plane, etc). Each type has 7 different parts, each part has four different rarity levels with yellow being the best, yellow parts have 5 different bonuses, you need all 7 parts with the same yellow bonus for it to activate. Each yellow part has 2 Affix bonuses that can be rerolled to help min-max the part (it makes a huge difference.)
Each part has it's own Performance level. Let's say you start with a Street Race car with 100 default performance rating. Each race you win you will get parts in a 97-103 performance range, the level of the parts will slowly go up from what you have. If you're unlucky you may have 160 Tires but 110 Brakes. Street Race performance maxes at 280 so once you get all your parts there you need to start grinding for a 280 yellow set. Remember each yellow part has 5 different bonuses and you need all 7 parts to be the same (yellow parts can be pretty rare). Now that you ground that out you need to waste around a million in game Bucks to min-max each part's affixes, two per part.
You think you're done? Do it again for the other 13 vehicle types.

I can keep going but if that's not enough for you I don't think anything else I say will really matter. Besides, thinking about things like the above grind for the Drag Race profession or back on track exploits is just depressing.

[b]Other Thoughts[/b]
-I really like the idea of weekly Summits. It's the only reason I've played the game as much as I have.
-Graphically the game is meh. It ranges from pretty good to pretty bad. There are some moments with pop in and LOD flickering that I almost wish the graphics were just worse. The flickering is so apparent and distracting. This is allegedly the fault of having planes in the game.
-The game takes quite a long time to boot up and connect to the Ubisoft servers. After you're in load times are very reasonable, at least on a SSD.",1585173424,1684478602,True,0,0,0.470195263624191284,0,True,False,False

Sure, if you're solely interested in racing, ""The Crew 2"" might scratch that itch. But don't get your hopes up for anything else. Want to customise your character and make them your own? Well, tough luck, because you're stuck with a roster of default characters, but you'll have to be smart about it - because you can never change that avatar again. Thanks, Ubi!

Now I know it's the 21st century, but some of us still live in the dark ages, and this game requires a constant internet connection, even for single-player mode. If you're in an area with less-than-stellar internet or you simply prefer playing offline, tough luck again.

But wait, there's more! Let's talk about the car tuning system, or lack thereof. Sure, you can fine-tune your vehicle, but it's all in the form of random loot drops that have nothing to do with actual functionality or your skill as a driver. It's like giving someone a toolbox full of random objects and saying, ""Good luck, hope you find something useful in there!"" Because apparently, making logical adjustments based on your driving preferences and style is just too much to ask for.

And we can't forget the voice acting, nor the absolute lack of quality in that department. Prepare yourself for some iffy voice acting that's as inconsistent as rush-hour traffic. It's like the developers rounded up a bunch of random uni students and said, ""Hey, can you do some voice lines? We'll pay you a half drunken beer and some leftover pizza.""

""The Crew 2"" is a game that had potential, but never failed to squander it at every turn. While some people might find enjoyment in its racing aspect, anyone seeking anything more will be deeply let down. It's best to hit the brakes on this one and find a game that truly delivers on its promises.

But to be honest form me whats the point of trying and achieve so hard to get some kind of limited edition from live summit where you can buy it from original one. Like i get it, people want to become the collector or trying to brag something that has been achieved, for that i get it but its frustrated for me to keep up like this, like performances from the players, sometimes most of the record at the top just like cheating and i don't get it. About the live summit, its fun but still i don't think it is worth it aside from getting credits, parts, and experience. Like example, im getting a lamborghini huracan but there is a lot of huracans because of limited edition, not for the performances but the looks and i dont need the duplicated version just for the looks, and i don't even care about similar performance, even though they are slightly different. One of the people find this is import and keep annoying me to get those unwanted cars but that is not my concern as im uninterested.

Its like those races are quite repetitive that is ok, i can clearly see some content but it feels like half ass to me. Boats is ok buy flying missions, it doesn't feel like races to me and solo stunting cause i prefer direct face with AI in stunts or races in air is better so i give my thumbs down.

Long story short:
-The Ubisoft Support is horrible (if you have any problem in-game they will not help you)
-A lot of bugs in this game.
-Horrible textures in some places.
-Some races are horrible, the curve arrow doesn't make any sense, you need to go forward and the arrows tell you to make left or right.
-A few cars
-Derby is annoying
And more things like this.

Story:

I played this game when Ubisoft+ was free for a month and then i unlocked about 60-+ cars. After ending my 1 free month subscription of Ubisoft+ I decided to buy this game on Steam. When I opened the game from Steam I had a surprise, all my 60 cars were blocked. Those cars appear in my garage but have the lock on them and i cant use the cars. Those cars are blocked by Ubisoft, I don't know why. When I saw this I created a ticket on Ubisoft.com explaining them the issue and the operator from live chat support told me to make a ticket on their website because there is a problem with my cars and a team must help me. I opened the ticket on 22 november, now it's 13 may and my issue was not solved, passed 7 months and nothing happend. I want to play this game but i can't with the cars locked and they are not responding to my ticket.

The Season Pass For The Crew 2 is utterly amazing, however, there are no Drag Cars, Hyper cars, Alpha Grand Prix Cars of any kind. It has been torture without them but i found some of every one of these classes, luckily. The game itself feels like Forza Horizon 5 with its own quirks. I love how Tio is the street racing boss but yet easy to beat. Just a heads up, if you can, buy the Red Bulls Alpha Grand Prix car, Although not the best. it is still wonderful. I'm guessing you want a good Hyper Car to start? The Jaguar 
XC-75. Albeit expensive, this Car is wonderful for its price. On the harder side to use and get so make sure to do plenty of Hyper Car races to get used to it! I hope this review helped many.

The game features a variety of vehicles, including cars, boats, planes, and motorcycles, and allows players to race across a scaled-down version of the United States. Here's a detailed review of the game, covering its good, bad, and ugly aspects:

The Good:

Vehicle Variety: The Crew 2 features a massive variety of vehicles, ranging from sports cars to airplanes. Each vehicle feels unique, and players can easily switch between them during races or exploration.

Open World: The game's open world is impressive, with a scaled-down version of the United States that is both diverse and well-designed. Players can drive, fly, or sail across the map, discovering hidden areas and engaging in various activities.

Multiplayer: The game's multiplayer features are well-implemented, allowing players to compete against each other in races or explore the world together. The game also features live events that are updated regularly, adding to the game's replay-ability.

Graphics: The game's graphics are impressive, with detailed environments, high-quality textures, and smooth animations. The game also features a dynamic weather system that adds to the game's immersive experience.

Customization: The game allows players to customize their vehicles, including their paint jobs, performance, and handling. This adds an extra layer of personalization to the game, allowing players to create unique builds and play styles.

The Bad:

Story: The game's story is weak and uninteresting, with a generic plot that serves as a backdrop for the game's racing events. The story missions also feel disconnected from the rest of the game, which can be jarring.

Repetitive Races: While the game's variety of vehicles is impressive, the races themselves can feel repetitive. Many of the races share similar layouts or objectives, which can lead to a feeling of deja vu.

AI Difficulty: The game's AI difficulty can be inconsistent, with some races feeling too easy and others feeling frustratingly difficult. This can be exacerbated by the game's rubber-banding mechanic, which can make it difficult to maintain a lead.

The Ugly:

Glitches and Bugs: The game suffers from various glitches and bugs, ranging from minor graphical issues to major game-breaking bugs. Some players have reported issues with the game's AI, physics, and save system, which can be frustrating.

Micro-transactions: The game features micro-transactions that can be used to purchase vehicles, customization options, and other in-game items. While the micro-transactions are not necessary to enjoy the game, some players may find them off-putting.

Overall, The Crew 2 is an enjoyable racing game that offers a massive open world, a variety of vehicles, and solid multiplayer features. While the game's story is weak, its graphics, customization options, and vehicle variety make up for it. However, the game's repetitive races, inconsistent AI difficulty, and occasional glitches and bugs may frustrate some players. Despite these flaws, The Crew 2 is still worth playing for anyone who enjoys open-world racing games.",1683840498,1683840498,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First off, the graphics were so good that I swear I could feel the wind rushing through my hair. And speaking of hair, the character customization options were so extensive that I was able to create a driver who looked just like me...if I had access to a professional stylist and plastic surgeon.

But the best part of the game was definitely the ability to switch between different vehicles on the fly. I mean, who wouldn't want to race a speedboat down the streets of New York City or fly a plane over the Grand Canyon? It was like being a superhero, except without all the responsibility and spandex.

Of course, there were some downsides too. The Al drivers seemed to have a vendetta against me and would ram into my car every chance they got. And I may or may not have accidentally driven my boat straight into a building while trying to take a shortcut.

Overall, ""The Crew 2"" was a wild and wacky experience that had me laughing and cursing in equal parts. If you're looking for a game that lets you live out your most ridiculous vehicular fantasies, this is the one for you.

1. Sometimes when tabbing, it ends up on the wrong screen. Two things, Ubisoft, One. Make sure the game's on screen ONE. Two. Make sure it STAYS on screen ONE! It's NOT hard for you, NONE of your other games does this, so WHY does The Crew 2 HAVE to? Get your things together! Edit: (In Full Screen mode, works like I want it to in Borderless, even so, sometimes I wanna get at whatever's under the game, so NOT having Full Screen work as intended is NO excuse even though Borderless fixes the issue.)
2. The map seems to have some randomizer that has 2 modes, either stupidly zoomed in or stupidly zoomed out, make up your damn mind and STICK WITH IT!
3. Just moving the mouse cursor outside of the game causes it to freeze and significantly slows the PC down, YOU, Ubisoft do NOT need to KNOW when WE tab out of the game, that's NONE of YOUR business, STOP IT!
4. Unskippable opening video, once done you have to press a button to ""Start your game"", then you have to wait for the game to load, once loaded, THEN can you start the game... how is this even REMOTELY useful? just render the menu and THEN load, we do NOT NEED a stupid intro, we do NOT NEED to press a stupid button for it to load, why not just start thje loading when you're ACTUALLY on your way INTO the game? Just so much unnessesary waiting and us having to input 5236985762398 things before we even get to the game, it's STUPID and UNNECESSARY. FIX IT Ubisoft! You DO know HOW to, just don't be lazy...
Edit:
5. Do NOT take up the WHOLE screen for EVERYTHING! I do NOT CARE how I did in a speed trap to the point of knowing EVERYTHING about how I did on it! Make the text MUCH smaller and ONLY have it on the top and bottom so that I at least CAN SEE what I'm doing after running through it... Also, on the subject, LET ME USE THE DAMN MAP TOO! Just because I'm running through it does NOT mean I MEANT to... sometimes, or MOST of the time I'm just getting to another place and that just happens to be in the way and VERY FEW are dodgeable, FIX IT!

My son got this game for Christmas in 2022 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

It's honestly a pretty fun game with some pretty good graphics and an expansive car lineup.
The only thing that I do have a gripe with, is the launcher when you start the game. When I start the game, it starts in Ubisoft's own launcher, which kinda sucks... Still, it's a really good racing game if you want open world and freedom. 

I would rate this game an 8.5/10, highly recommended. It does have some quirks, but most of these are minor and won't really get in your way.

The graphics are very good and the gameplay is very fun so in that case the game is definitely worth buying, however, this game has terrible support for the 'Logitech G29' wheel, as it will intermittently not recognise the wheel and won't create any button maps for it, I googled the issue and found it's been an issue for over a year and yet there's still no fix other than manually button mapping each thing, 'Ubisoft' don't know how to fix it and are clearly making no effort to even though it says on their website that the game has full support for it. The issue seems to be hit or miss and only affect some people, so there is a chance you'll have no issue but just know that there is a chance you''ll have to do a lot of manual editing to make the game work as expected.

Simply the best car/racing game, big map, does not need an amazing pc (i've played with gtx 1650, i5 6500 on low settings) Max settings works magnificent with a rtx 3060 with i5 12600k on 60 fps. I recommend buying on sale when it's around 10 dollars because it's really worth it. Also no game breaking bugs, met like 2 bugs in 170 hours of gameplay.

It's clear to me that The Crew 2 was developed by some really passionate people who had an eye for detail, and it's a miracle that they somehow managed to wrangle such a huge and diverse game into a package where everything in it feels competently made.

Really, I'm blown away. There's a huge diversity of racing disciplines, and each one feels unique and well thought-out in their handling and design. For example doing a street race and messily barreling through a city feels vastly different from racing on a track (where, at higher difficulties, taking a good racing line will actually matter), or off-roading through the countryside and trying to manage bouncing through technical terrain. And then you have vehicles like dirt bikes that feel so different that they feel like they could've been in their own game; and then we got boats and planes, that again, are well-made and don't feel like jank bolted onto the game to tick some checkboxes.

The individual tracks themselves also all feel hand-made too, so there's no copy-pasta syndrome to be found here. And given that you'll be racing through complicated cityscapes and/or through large swathes of open country, the devs have also taken care to make sure where you need to go is always sign-posted so that you can focus on the race instead of on your mini-map.

Then there's the world. All I'll say it's absolutely huge, and it's been a blast road-tripping through the United States and creating my own stories.

So what's not good?

The physics. They work, and you can quickly get used to them, but the skill ceiling for mastering it is quite low. You can pretty much full-throttle it 90% of the time, and having to slow down or take a good line is an extremely rare event.

Being able to tailor the difficulty to your skill is also a big problem. Every event has 3 difficulty levels, but you're not able to freely select them, and must finish the event on lower difficulties before you'll be able to access the higher ones. Because of this, almost every event in the game has been too easy for me (I'm usually 10-30 seconds ahead of my opponents), even when I try to match my car's level with the event's recommended level. Sometimes matching the recommended level would give me a challenge, or I'd have to be 10-25 levels behind in order to not have the game turn into a Time Trial Simulator.

The loot system. It adds nothing to the game; all you do is just swap out lower numbers for higher numbers. Not to mention that because I was forced to play through every event on the lowest difficulty levels first, I never bothered with equipping upgrades because it'd have made these events even easier and more boring.

So in terms of raw fun factor, I'd have to give this game a 7. When the game gives you a proper challenge, it's absolutely exhilarating, but far too often you'll just end up yawning from being in 1st place all the time. In my playthrough the magic of the game wore off towards the end because I just wanted to finish the campaign, and I got tired of figuring out how many levels my car should've be under-leveled so that things wouldn't be too easy or too difficult.

But in the end, I must still give this game a thumbs-up due to how unique and how absolutely massive in scope it is. There's just nothing like it, and at a sale price of 80%, it's not hard to recommend.",1681804887,1681868387,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

good if you play at least with one friend

other than cars you have like , well more cars and planes and boats , its fun (with the bugs too)
its not that competitive , which is exactly why is much better than other racing games , overall a chill game

That aside, here are some low points of the game;
Even if you shell out $50 to buy the game, is pay to win afterwards.
The upgrade system for parts to upgrade vehicles was done badly.
Not alot of people are ever online.
I never see updates for fixing bugs in the game.
I don't know how to make my own Crew, nothing seems strait forward, and/or everything over complex where it should be simple, and everything in other areas of the game is too simple when should be more complex.
I could add few more complaints, but I'll just end it with, if you wanna exit the game, then gotta go to options, scroll off screen all the way to the right, is like a hidden feature that is very hidden, just for the option to exit the game, very dumb if ask me.

All of that aside, the game is actually really fun, the concept of every race type imaginable all in one is incredible.
The game runs very smooth.
Even if just racing against NPC's, is incredibly fun. (is many still playing all these years later if wanna race others)
The graphics for the whole USA blows my mind away, so very detailed no matter where you go, whether inside of cities, or out in the middle of nowhere, is all eye candy.
I'd say is a top notch game in many ways!!

All and all, if want an Epic Racing Game that is like no others, one that you will not regret buying, than this one is very good. And for the ones that say the controls are bad in the game, they probably have beginner stuff, and not yet have tasted a vehicle with upgraded stuff in it. They just need to put a few more hours in I'd say, or get better at racing. Am on keyboard here, can only imagine how much better a steering wheel would be, but keyboard works amazingly well.

Hope this review helps some people. :)",1681052844,1681052844,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's a sequel to the popular game The Crew and features an expanded gameplay experience, including the ability to race in cars, boats, planes, and motorcycles. Here is the review of The Crew 2, mentioning both the positive and negative aspects of the game.

Positive aspects:
The Crew 2 has a vast open-world map that allows you to explore the United States and participate in a wide variety of races and challenges. The game offers a seamless transition between vehicles, making it easy to switch between land, sea, and air racing. The game's graphics are impressive, with stunning visuals that showcase different locations and terrains realistically. The game's physics engine is also noteworthy, as it provides a realistic and immersive driving experience.

Another positive aspect of The Crew 2 is the variety of races and events. The game features various race modes, including street racing, rally racing, and drag racing. The game also has events that involve performing stunts, time trials, and speed challenges. This variety adds a level of excitement to the game, as there is always something new to do and explore.

Negative aspects:
One of the negative aspects of The Crew 2 is the lack of a compelling story. The game's narrative is thin, and the characters are not well developed. This can make the game feel shallow and lacking in substance. Additionally, the game's AI opponents are not very challenging, making it easy to win races and challenges. This lack of difficulty can lead to the game feeling repetitive and boring after a while.

Another negative aspect of The Crew 2 is the microtransaction system. While the game itself is not a pay-to-win title, some of the in-game content is locked behind a paywall. This can make the game feel like a grind, as you need to spend a lot of time earning in-game currency to unlock new vehicles and upgrades.

Grade:
Overall, The Crew 2 is an enjoyable racing game with impressive visuals, a wide variety of vehicles, and a large open world to explore. However, the lack of a compelling story and challenging AI opponents can detract from the overall experience. Additionally, the microtransaction system can make the game feel like a grind at times. Despite its flaws, The Crew 2 is still a fun game to play, and I would give it a solid 7 out of 10.",1681011112,1681011233,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1) Car customization still feels like half baked, like if you want certain body part and rim to look esthetic, it really missed the mark. Like there is no body kit manufacture/brand, all the customization preset are just mix-n-match, not come close like other title like NFS series does. Example car like GTR which potentially hold lots of customization laughably can hold 3 body kit preset in this game. This part of the game really need to improve the most as for what you play racing/car game for then? 
2) Same grinding to earn money really come to tear off. Maybe you need to add race customization slider like traffic car density and lap round. Certain player like short race then repeat that over again and again, some player enjoy long trip race but all the available race option it offer are too few. Although, overtime they did add lots of race option into the game, but it does not feel variable as each of these race does not feel so different one to another, and very few variable long trip race being add to base of the game, else from weekly summit event in the game. 
3) I kinda missed the OG the crew 1 where there is free roam police, the thrilling police chase and things to do around the map rather than this 'soy' and being 'legit' of following rules, influencer of motor world wannabe nonsense. In anyway, i didnt deny that adding the wannabe police chase mode aka stuntman mode, movie setup, etc of whatever nonsense creativity you want to bring but the what really keep player busy doing around the map when not in the mood grinding money from race is maybe adding the police chase that your playerbase had been crying out loud for many years yet you would never want to do that. Not gonna spend my time roaming around searching for exp box + car part inside them or perhaps the nobody ask for of the boat and plane being add into this game further render this 'soy' mode in game sink more and more. 

That is all my not recommend tag for this game, perspectively from veteran player. I cant say much for those who are new or want to find reason of if they need to buy this game or not but i would say no since if you are looking for element of customization, grind and diversity of the game could offer for you, in short and long term, it is kinda meh and not worthy. The only good thing in this game is that the very large open world map, LOTS and LOAD of car and they still add few more to the list but thats all.",1545300330,1681001550,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Oyun eğlenceli arcade takip ettiğim Disket Kutusu, Enis Kirazoğlu, Sinan Akkol tarafından serinin ilk oyunundaki gibi çok başarılı olmayan bir oyun olarak çıktığını hatırlıyorum ama Ben söylenenlerin aksine ilk indirimini bekleyip gold edition aldım ve aldığımdan itibaren eski Uplay şimdiki Ubisoft Connect programının başıma açtığı dertlerden oynyamayıp aşağıda ellemediğim eski yorumumda bunu yazsam da şuan oyuna haksızlık ettiğimi fark ettim çünkü eğlenceli farklı kategorilerde sürüş tarzı asfaltta eğlenceli arazide araçlar yavaş gidiyor sıkıcı ama güzel bir sürüş başka bir örneğini hatırlamadığım uçak ve bot kullanımı var ki uçak ve botlarda çeşit çeşit kategorilerde küçüğü büyüğü çok ilginç çeşitli. Oyunda yarış yaptıkça düşen farklı seviyeleri olan araç geliştirme parçaları biraz iğrenç bir sistem olsa da (aynı yarışı 1000 defa [b] GELİŞTİRMEK İSTEDİĞİN HER ARAÇ İÇİN [/b] yapma firmaların sevdiği ama hoş olmayan bir model) yaptım; youtube'da kısayollar aradım en kısa kolay yarışı buldum araç kastım... Menü olarak biraz garip basit bir yapısı var ama iş görür ki menü konusunda en saçma komik şey '90lar gibi oyunu kapatmak için ayarlar menüsüne girmek bence; ayarlarda en sonda oyundan çıkış var ama neden ? :D

Biraz daha oyun sürüş hakkında ayrıntıya girersem araç arazi aracı olunca aynı aracın daha güçsüz hissettirmesi saçma geldi. Araba arazi için modifiye edilmiş ama neden bu kadar zor gidiyor demiştim başlangıçta çünkü oyunda araçlar kart sistemi gibi yarıştan gelen yolda bulduğun daha iyi seviyesi olan kartı araca tak sistemi olunca başta biraz sıkıcı denebilir. Eğlenceli görsellere para harcattıran gerçek dışı arcade bir sürüş ile eğlendiğim çeeşit çeşit araç ile gezebildiğim hoş bir oyun. İlk aldığımdan beri çok gelişti. Çok paralı içerik eklendi, bir kısmını denedim. Güzel.

The Crew 2 is an open-world racing game developed by Ivory Tower and published by Ubisoft. It was released in 2018 and is a sequel to the original The Crew game. The game allows players to explore a vast open-world recreation of the United States, race against other players online, and collect a variety of vehicles, including cars, boats, planes, and motorcycles.

Pros and cons
🟩 Positives	
- Expansive open-world with a variety of environments to explore

- Impressive level of vehicle customisation

- Wide range of vehicles to collect, including rare and unique ones

- Well-designed vehicle models with realistic handling

- Weekly events and challenges provide a sense of progression and competition

- Impressive graphics and sound design

🟥 Negatives	

- Grindy nature of the game may be off-putting for some players

- Limited storyline and lack of compelling characters

- Some ""vanities"" can only be obtained through real money or live summits

- Multiplayer PvP mode is limited to simple point-to-point races

- Some bugs and issues with the game, though most have been addressed through updates and patches.

Gameplay
The Crew 2's gameplay is enjoyable and immersive, with a strong emphasis on exploration and racing. The game's expansive open-world allows players to explore various environments, from bustling cities to scenic countryside landscapes. The game's attention to detail is impressive, with realistic handling of the different vehicles and a wide range of customisation options.

Events
The game's ""live summits"" events are weekly events where players can win vanity items or time-limited cars. However, some players may struggle to win the top prize without first obtaining cars and parts that give them an advantage. The game's multiplayer PvP mode is a simple race from point A to point B.

Vehicles
The game offers rare, unique vehicles not usually found in other racing games. The game's vehicle models are well-designed, and the level of customisation is impressive, allowing players to almost widebody every car. However, some of the game's ""vanities"" can only be obtained through real money or live summits, which may be off-putting for some players.

Story
The game's story is minimal, with no clear protagonist or antagonist, and the game focuses more on exploration and racing than storytelling. However, the game's open-world and the various challenges and events provide a sense of progression.

Graphics and Sound
The game's graphics are impressive, with detailed vehicle models and environments that look and feel realistic. The game's sound design is also noteworthy, with diverse sound effects adding to the immersive experience.

Conclusion
Overall, The Crew 2 is an enjoyable and immersive racing game that offers a vast open-world, a wide range of vehicles, and various events to compete in. The game's attention to detail is impressive, and the vehicle models are well-designed with realistic handling. However, some players may find the game's grindy nature and lack of a compelling story mode to be a turnoff. Nevertheless, The Crew 2 is still a game worth playing for racing fans and those who enjoy exploring and customising their vehicles.",1680873636,1680873679,True,1,0,0.497925341129302979,0,True,False,False

I was also disappointed with the game's reliance on microtransactions, which made progression feel slow and tedious without spending additional money.

+ Overall well optimized 
+ Great Music playlists through several radio stations
+ Wide variety of play styles, including Playing as a cop, Boats, Planes, Demo derby, Gymkhana(ish) etc (Plane and Boat races are boring and extremely unbalanced, respectively.)

- Weird physics but it's possible to get used to it
- You need to repeat the same f*cking event 3 times to get the best loot possible
- The loot/car upgrade system is uncanny
- No engine swaps
- No free roam cops (Can you even be chased by cops in this game?)
- Always online
- Premium Motorpass/ Micro transactions (they are avoidable)
- did i mention weird physics?

[h2] Gameplay [/h2]
The Crew 2's gameplay is enjoyable and immersive, with a strong emphasis on exploration and racing. The game's expansive open-world allows players to explore various environments, from bustling cities to scenic countryside landscapes. The game's attention to detail is impressive, with realistic handling of the different vehicles and a wide range of customisation options.

[h3] Events [/h3]
The game's ""live summits"" events are weekly events where players can win vanity items or time-limited cars. However, some players may struggle to win the top prize without first obtaining cars and parts that give them an advantage. The game's multiplayer PvP mode is a simple race from point A to point B.

[h2] Vehicles [/h2]
The game offers rare, unique vehicles not usually found in other racing games. The game's vehicle models are well-designed, and the level of customisation is impressive, allowing players to almost widebody every car. However, some of the game's ""vanities"" can only be obtained through real money or live summits, which may be off-putting for some players.

[h2] Story [/h2]
The game's story is minimal, with no clear protagonist or antagonist, and the game focuses more on exploration and racing than storytelling. However, the game's open-world and the various challenges and events provide a sense of progression.

[h2] Graphics and Sound [/h2]
The game's graphics are impressive, with detailed vehicle models and environments that look and feel realistic. The game's sound design is also noteworthy, with diverse sound effects adding to the immersive experience.

[h2] Conclusion [/h2]
Overall, The Crew 2 is an enjoyable and immersive racing game that offers a vast open-world, a wide range of vehicles, and various events to compete in. The game's attention to detail is impressive, and the vehicle models are well-designed with realistic handling. However, some players may find the game's grindy nature and lack of a compelling story mode to be a turnoff. Nevertheless, The Crew 2 is still a game worth playing for racing fans and those who enjoy exploring and customising their vehicles.",1680488968,1680488981,True,26,2,0.720228195190429688,0,True,False,False

In Crew 2 getting a new car has a sense of achievement. I played both, Crew 2 is far more enjoyable, even the driving. Horizon 5 is more like a cheap arcade game if it was not for all the hype for some visual gimmicks.Update: story missions are super fun and engaging, large cities are simply amazing (see Chicago, St. Luis, etc), driving is also very fun, recommend to drive open cars like the Porsche Syder 550 to see more of the world as you drive. If you are on the fence defiantly get it, drive with a new version of Xbox controller, and set your settings correctly to drive (look on line for advice). Start with the story missions, they consist of 12 parts each, some less, but each takes about your better part of a real day.  The reward is usually a car , which is nice as cars are hard to get in this game unless you want to pay for micro-transactions, which of course you should not do, it just ruins the fun and the achievement.Also, 10,000 km of roads, amazing country and scenery, awesome vehicles, and super fun driving (somehow more fun than any other driving games I tried in the past).",1680068683,1680149345,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I leveled up, which deleted my progress to that destination, so I had to drive all the way from the west coast, to the east coast again. almost 20 minutes of boring high ways... twice in a row >.<
3. the menu is weird to navigate. I often end up pushing the wrong button, which puts me into the store and also deletes my progress towars a story destination -.-

The thing that makes The Crew 2 great is its variety. Unlike most racing games out there, this game gives you a taste of almost every conceivable racing sport, on land, in the sea, or in the air. From street racing to offroad, motorcycles, dirt bikes, monster trucks, speed boats, demolition derby, aerial acrobatics, and even hovercraft; there's a little bit of everything here. The beauty is that none of them is too difficult for you to quickly grasp the basics, allowing you to seamlessly drift between disciplines to your heart's content. My personal favorites are the multi-discipline events, switching styles mid-race. I also found most of the bikes really satisfying to drive.

The game definitely leans toward the arcade end of the arcade/simulator spectrum, so if you're looking for true depth, you may find the game lacking.

Bad things about the game:
Firstly, this game uses a system of loot boxes with random items to upgrade vehicle performance, which is highly annoying if you are looking for a specific item because it cannot be found in a specific area or bought using the in game (or real world) currency.  I personally found the loot box system so annoying I stopped playing and bought Forza.  If you can get over the randomly stupid loot boxes then read on.  This game has BattlEye cheat protection which may work while competing against other players, but does not stop cheaters from obtaining impossible speed records.  
Good things about the game:
There are heaps of different vehicles and heaps of different races, both single player and multiplayer.  While there are heaps of different vehicles to race and heaps of different things to do, be aware that this is a game with very arcade physics and not a simulator.  If you are looking for a simulator experience, this is fun, but it's probably not the game for you, however if you are looking for a game that you can just play without having to worry about micro managing vehicle setups and going through ludicrous qualifying stages then this is a decent game (except for the loot boxes).",1581164470,1679212097,False,0,0,0.467032968997955322,0,True,False,False

the GPS sucks massive ass, and regularly tells me to go directly up a literal canyon in order to reach my destination.

They give you rewards (vehicles, cosmetics, followers, depending on the scope of the story) for driving at your own pace -- though you do have to complete a given leg of a story (not the whole story) from start to finish in one session, usually 5 to 20 minutes a leg. Just make sure the Start location goal turns green before you drive all the way to the final goal... mark my words!

Open-world graphics range from great to decent to ehh. They're mostly good. Many different event types and vehicle types. I'd like to see more classic cars, especially from the 30's-50's, but there are at least a few nice ones. The option to select user-created liveries is a lot of fun.

* Mighty Mac in real life does not begin on the northern edge of Detroit, and has only two towers.

[b]Playstyle[b]: While Forza Horizon genre becomes dull in a few hours of play time, Crew 2 does it's job of keeping the game alive in any way or form. Live summits are renewed every week, requiring you to grind new vehicles to perform better in the leaderboard. The races in the summits are not seperated from each other and you need every kind of vehicle to achieve a decent point. Grinding for points is easily understanable in 4-5 hours into the game for an average player, unlike other racing games in the genre which takes a lot longer. 

[b]Driving[b]: Not as good as other games in the genre, though has its own style such as drag cars, hypercars and offroad cars. The driving styles are seperated in every category, not as realistic but gets you hooked anyways.

[b]Casual Friendly?[b] : Yes, only factor keeping the game competitive is pretty much weekly summits which is not obligatory to do. You can pretty much try to beat your own score and leave too.

[b]Multiplayer[b]: Not often that you see PvP matches but you can add friends to grind money and followers together which is a much better dynamic.

[b]Pros[b]: A big open world map that'll take hours to roam.
Casual friendly
Monthly Pass is ignorable 
Can playable in Geforcenow with an average internet

[b]Cons[b]:
It is owned by Ubisoft (lame).
Not as realistic.
Cars are limited though not inadequate.

The first thing that happened to me in the beta was I drove my car off the ski slope jump and immediately collided with someone in a low flying plane. No, I did not set that up, I have no friends. I just knocked someone out of the air with my car coincidentally because I wanted to see if they fixed the physics going ape shit when you land a non-raid vehicle after a huge jump.

Compared to TC1:

++ improved open world
++ more cars
++ sound design, cars sound more dynamic now.
++ no, seriously, they put more effort into the world
++ anticheat so the records can finally not be arbitrarily limited however Ivory Tower eventually put in place in TC1 where you can now set an actual world record but not have it count because they considered it beyond the ""you're cheating"" barrier
++ manual livery editor, not unlike Forza.

-- anticheat doesn't work on linux and stops you from playing at all even 5 years later.
-- the story is somehow even worse, how did you make a worse story
-- why are we driving on rooftops?
-- I hate more than half of the racing types in this game and there's nothing you can do to skip them if you really, really hate them
-- last I tried, bikes are even more annoying than in TC1
-- they removed arbitrary fast travel because ""you have planes now and hypercars are fast"" so if you don't like any of those you can go fuck yourself, or pray someone set a land speed record where you want to go
-- doing the same stunt jump in Chicago for 2 hours to level a car was annoying but now there's no reason to do anything at all. I had no motivation to do literally anything in game anymore.
-- Forza 3 has a better livery editor. Like being able to precisely set the positions of stuff. If that still doesn't exist in this game, it's less advanced than a title available on the Xbox 360 from 2009. I don't even remember if that level of detail was in Forza 2, but if it was it doesn't make their editor any better.
-- CARBON FIBRE STILL CANNOT BE PAINTED OVER WITH PAINT OR DECALS


~~ No vehicles will be locked behind a paywall... except this vintage Porsche 911 Turbo you now want because you literally cannot earn it. The Bladerunner 35 looks dumb so I'm not personally bothered but still upset by principle, and the Spitfire MK IX in Aerobatics being paywalled was also really stupid.
~~ There is no longer a division between ""Street"" and ""Performance"" where cars seemingly randomly have a street version but no performance version, ex. the Chrysler 300C SRT8 in TC1, which is basically a Dodge Charger, but only available in Street probably due to licencing. Or the reverse which means the car is available for the spec with the least races in the Story [i]and[/i] PvP despite being the spec with the most vehicles (WHY?). I did not buy enough cars to find out if there's still an issue like there was in TC1 where around 50% of the Performance category is unusable at max level because there's ""Performance"" and ""[b]Performance[/b]"" spec vehicles divided by ""is basically a fast street car"" and ""this rivals a circuit spec car."" Now instead you have ""road cars"" and ""really really fast road cars"" which also means ""I hope you really like a modern hypercar (that's in this game) because if not this is going to be a set of long and boring races because it's either hypercars or no car""",1678357282,1678365866,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

If you expect realism, this game isn't for you, but if fun and speed is what you're after, you honestly can't do much better than this.

The variety is honestly spectacular, you can go from a driving an F1 car, to racing in speed boats and then fly around in an acrobatic plane in the same event, its nuts! 

The game also tells me that 69% (nice) of my time spent in the game was on street racing, and there's good reason for that, because you can turn any car you want into an absolute monster, the customization is pretty good as well, despite the parts being all original from the game (brand name parts are still sorely missed).

It sounds good on paper but as the game really plays, the map is quantity over quality, in exchange for such a large map they had the game essentially looking like a mobile game. Another issue is the races are just boring roadtrips if they aren't just within a single city. That's all fine and dandy except when you consider the handling is very barebones and the sense of speed is basically nonexistent, plus the soundtrack isn't really the best so you're really just in for an incredibly boring, incredibly long ride. I have never fallen asleep playing games unless I was really comfortable but this game had me snoring while standing up, that's not what you want out of a video game. Another thing this game offers is vehicles. Personally I only really care about the cars and let me tell you, the car list is pretty solid. A good amount of tuner, muscle, and supercars. They even have a good selection of bikes and even a hovercraft if that tickles your fancy. The game also has customization which is where the fun ends for me. I do want to say that the customization isn't so bad, and it almost isn't. But it's mainly just splitter kits and tacky spoilers, alot of the better customized cars coming with some pretty ugly body kits that make Need for Speed Underground 2 look more considerable. If I had to say, I'd recommend just buying Forza Horizon, you'll have more fun with that mess than you will here. But if you want a real recommendation, despite the fandom calling it essentially one of the worst games ever, Need for Speed Unbound is a great game. Significantly better customization, more unique handling between cars, a banger soundtrack, colorful artstyle, beautiful city to go along with the stunning graphics, and the single player story is more interesting than whatever The Crew 2 has to offer. This game feels like a cheap yet incredibly overpriced Forza clone and it's not worth your time or money. I already wasted mine and have taken too long to get my refund, I just hope you can spare your wallet or save the money for something better. Maybe Motorfest will be better at least, I really do hope for the best for that game.",1678163901,1678163901,False,3,0,0.563492059707641602,0,True,False,False

This won't be the best explanation or review but at least I hope this will help you decide, but from now I will tell you WAIT FOR A SALE it's not a this good of a game to be worht the full price for it. 

Let's Begin.

Cars: There are so many cars to collect and there is at least a few that you won't usually see in forza or any other racing game (Unless they get inspired by it). For example Bugatti La voiture noire and cars that are completely created out of nowhere (If I'm not wrong) with a lot of customization, which leads to my next point.

Customization: You can almost widebody every single car in the game, the customization might not be need for speed style but you can still make it cool. But there is something called ""Vanitys"" you can change almost every part of the car that goes tires,windows,nitro color,tire smoke and neons, but you can earn them by buying them with real money OR through live summets but if you don't care about that it shouldn't be a big deal.

Events: The only events in this game are ""live summets"" they are weekly events where you can win vanitys or cars that are time limited. For a new player you can't win the top prize, no chance. You need cars and parts that give you a bit of advantage which sucks but at least you can try and win something on it.

Mulitplayer PVP: Race from point A to point B that's all.

Open World: The map is huge and it will take a very long time to travel alone or with your friends from the left side to the right side of the map. It suppost to be America but not really because the citys are small and it's inaccurate.

Everything else is just personal opinion, I hope this review helped with your decision.",1678051420,1678051420,True,61,0,0.839448332786560059,0,True,False,False

It might be unrealistic and have funky physics but one thing they got right is fun. I think this is the most fun I've had playing a game for a long time.

I really like the vast screenshot and filming functions. I'm a big fan of video game photography, which might sound hilarious. It's a neat hobby that many video game enthusiasts have. The ability to control the blur, the filter, the time of day and more makes the activity of taking screenshots much better. I have already taken some good shots in my first three hours of playing.

Long story short, if you enjoyed playing Steep you will probably enjoy The Crew 2.

Think oldschool Lego game driving feel, Not the lego racing games, the TT game vehicle handling model. This worlds interpretation of gravity seems to be that the ground is a magnet. Where normal gravity has you take a jump and soar through a beautiful arc through the air. This games jump ends with a direct drop straight to the ground with the least satisfying of crashes. And thats with any vehicle, thats just how the ""physics"" work. Them putting stuntparks and jumps in here is nothing short of ballzy with these physics, as it so clearly outlines how abysmal they are. You want a fun arcade racer with easy but competent physics? Hotwheels unleashed is infinitely more complex and intuitive than this game.

I played the demo for this about 2 years ago, felt like trash then, feels the same now. Theres a lot of things that this game does well and compared to Forzas dilapidated state of content and complete lack of personality, This game has a lot of good ideas and flare, and really, it has massive potential. The physics are not okay, they're not what I consider passable my any degree. The first Crew had passable physics and driving, This is like that game if it were made in 1996, but remember, Porsche unleashed came out in 2000. And by comparison, Porsche would be a certified racing sim. Its close to the worst driving Ive ever experienced, but I used to play a lot of bootleg cheap iphone racing apps back in highschool 10 years ago, so its just slightly above that standard for me.

The kicker for me requesting a refund was that I log in today and my controller mapping is completely borked. Cant reset to default, doesnt fix it. Cant remap to get an accept button, Just completely unusable. On the forums on here I learn its a common issues and the best solutions are messing with code files. At that point I requested a refund. 
The devs appear to have stopped fixing issues, but they seem to still be releasing content to dangle MTX and paid transactions ingame. What an absolute shame. I heard they're planning another entry soon to compete more directly with the Horizon franchise. I guarantee you wont see me there if the physics are not at least 10x better than this, because Horizon 5 is probably 30x.

Despite common misconceptions and stereotypes, many furries lead normal and healthy lives, just like any other person.

Like any community, furries have their own interests, hobbies, and social events. They may participate in online discussions, attend conventions or meetups, or create art and music related to their furry interests. While some furries may enjoy wearing fursuits or costumes, many do not and simply enjoy the creative aspect of furry art and character design.

Research has shown that furries tend to be well-adjusted and socially competent individuals who value friendship, creativity, and acceptance. They come from all walks of life and backgrounds, and share a common passion for the furry fandom.

The physics feel off, and the handling is far too simplistic, making it difficult to maneuver around tight corners or maintain control at high speeds. The game's emphasis on arcade-style racing also detracts from any sense of realism, which may disappoint those looking for a more authentic driving experience. Overall, the poor driving model is a major drawback to an otherwise promising game.",1625081478,1676755924,False,0,0,0.481972932815551758,2,True,False,False

Though, there are some downsides to the game but the positives outweigh the bad ones. 

The game's fun, the big map adds a lot, but most often it just feels desolate with only about 10 different npc car models and the pedestrians.
Big selection of cars, bikes, boats, planes, but to be honest you'll be playing with cars most of the time. Plane control is horrendous so I just avoid them, boats are fine. The game does not have any cars from 2020 from what I've noticed.

You'll be crashing into npc cars on the road a lot and I mean a lot, sometimes they're literally  invisible or they just spawn right in front of you while you're going at 400 km/h.

I wouldn't recommend buying this game alone, try to persuade a friend or two since going solo will be super boring. (most fun times i've had were when me and my friends would go on road trips across america with wonky vehicles).

Good luck finding a pvp match or players in general since the servers are pretty dead with their being 1-3 people in a regular session.
Do not buy this game when it's off sale, don't scam yourself by paying the full price, just wait for a sale and get it for pretty cheap.

Godspeed.

Every car,boat,plane is so damn expensive to purchase. You can play NFS or Forza Horizon game for 50 hours and purchase everything those games have to offer. But in here after playing for 50 hours i only got 4 cars and few boats&planes. It takes ridiculous amount of time to purchase something. Controls are kinda janky i played it with kbm and dualshock 4 and it felt like game tried to act like half sim and half arcade but in the end it couldn't do either of them a justice. It's not a terrible game though, graphics are fine and it's cool to take your favorite vehicle and ride it through map of whole USA. In the end the game couldn't satisfy my needs and disappointed me.

About 200+ square mile map, tons of real world landmarks outside of the major cities, many small cities, photo op and story side missions requiring traveling. good amount of cars, some notables missing(no 90's NSX, S15, 65' Cobra, F50 etc), can use planes and boats too, they are decent, you'll either love it or hate it, dont have to use them. 4 main discipline catagories with 4 sub catagories within. main story is bare bones, told mostly in subtitles. Main rivals are laughable. handling model is alright. some issues. two game currencies called Crew Credits and Bucks. CC must be gained using real money. You level up from gaining followers you win from events and doing tricks in free roam. Good game with some glaring issues

Long review:
My first impressions when playing the first 20 minutes was that the handling model was strange but not too much of a problem, but when I came to realize is that this game has the strangest handling model of any game that ive played. Nearly every car seems to spontaneously lose grip when going around corners. whats worse is that the certain cars have handling that is complete opposite of their real counterparts. Case in point two cars, the 2018 Nismo R35 and the Lamborghini Veneno, The Nismo handles more like a 65 Shelby Cobra would, tail happy all the time with no downforce. The Veneno has the steering response of a Lincoln Continental. I suspect they do this to foment discontent so you spend money to try and fix the issue

The map is cool, lots of things to see and do. You have a home base in LA that will change as your Icon level goes up(you get another in Florida if you have the Season Pass). There are photo ops in each of the 4 catagories(Street Race, Freestyle, Off Road, and Pro Racer) There are Hobbies with 3 catagories(Explorer, Collector, and Racer) with LOTS of in game achievements. There are 12+ Stories where you travel all over the map to unique locations that take hours by themselves to complete because of travel distances and you get unique prizes like cars and custom wheels, horns, nos etc. There is also I live summit event which consists of 8 events varying in disciplines and is point based. You compete with other players in point totals going from bronze to platinum(platinum being the top 4000 players). Prizes for each medal, platinum being a rare custom item you can only get through live summit. There are also PVP events in  as well which ive never tried as of now but you just add the human factor to all the things ive mentioned

As you progress the map with show events as you progress as well as the headquarters of the 4 main disciplines. Traveling around is fun and engaging. You can see other players as well, up to about 10  There is also a day night cycle and some cars even show the progression of time on their digital dashboards if they have them. The graphics are decent but I have a serious problem with the pop in and the lack of sufficient detail on distant objects at ultra settings. Also settings any resolution past 1900x1200 with show constant microstuttering, at least for me, no fix as of yet. So I cant set the game to my monitors native resolution which sucks and is a mark against the games appeal

Overall I would recommend the game but on sale. Full price it has too many glaring issues to be worth full price.

The game offers a diverse range of vehicles, from sports cars to airplanes, that players can use to race and perform stunts. The game's map is massive and well-detailed, offering players a variety of landscapes and environments to explore.

However, The Crew 2 is not without its flaws. The game's controls can feel loose and unresponsive at times, making it difficult to navigate tight turns or perform stunts. The AI opponents can also be overly aggressive, leading to a number of frustrating accidents during races. The game's story is also underwhelming and lacks depth, making it difficult for players to become fully invested in the game world.

Despite these issues, The Crew 2 is still a fun and engaging racing game that is well worth checking out for fans of the genre. The game's diverse range of vehicles and vast open-world map make it a unique and enjoyable experience that is sure to provide hours of entertainment.",1675578231,1675578231,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Really fun to play with friends. Especially with the ""Crew' mechanic, which means if you are playing with a friend, and one of you win, you both win. Weekly updates (Summits) can keep you playing for a long time after you finish everything. Every week Summits allow you to compete against other players to win limited edition items/cars, which keeps things fresh. Game also receives free DLC updates few times a year. Another + to this game, is Motorpasses (Crew 2's equivalent to battle passes) can be purchased with in-game currency, so you don't have to buy In-game micro-transactions to get the new stuff! (To my knowledge this is the first game to do this) A lot of people reviewed this game for it's ""poor"" story. Even though it's about ""becoming famous"" and gaining followers, it can still be enjoyable, and it keeps getting updated and getting better with every update. You can see that the developers really try to make this game better with every update. Overall: Would highly recommend this game.

[h1] Story [/h1]
The game is mostly about street racers trying to legalize street racing and have fun[i] (3/4 disciplines, because Pro Racer is salty as hell.) [/i] IMO this is a weird turn from the first The Crew game where it's like, about revenge and underground stuff
[i] Cons, see Gameplay. [/i]

[h1] Pros [/h1]
[list]
[*][b]Visual & Scenery[/b] - If you're up for chill rides and scenic routes, this game has a good landscape and graphics.
[*][b]Bikes[/b] - One of the reasons I'm still coming back to this game is I love street racing games and bikes, which FH and NFS can't offer. [i]But still, see Cons.[/i]
[*][b]Planes[/b] - This game has them and ngl I love my Mustang so much.
[*][b]Free Battlepass[/b] - You could get them with a huge amount of grind currency. But hey, 'least it's free, eh?
[*][b]Exploration[/b] - This game has a lot of side activity beside racing. Photography, not gonna lie, this game has great photo mode. And Stories, where you get to travel to places finding secrets which I didn't get to it fully just yet.[spoiler]Or I'm just hungry for it because PSO2 NGS exploration sucks so much.[/spoiler]
[/list]

[h1] Cons [/h1]
[list]
[*][b]Unforgiving Competition [/b] - It's not that I'm a snowflake that can't the L, but according to the story, the competitions is supposed to be [i] for sports and fun [/i]. But no, in this game, If you lost, you won't get no jackshit. Not even a perf part to gitgud. It's supposed to be like Forza Horizon and not like NFS universe where GGEZ is a thing.
[*][b]Bikes[/b] - Bikes suck. Ubisoft just nerfed them to the lowest pit of hell. I used to ride Panigale everywhere, and now it could barely corner at all. And not just Panigale, everything. Fireblade, Draxter, S1KRR, you name it. They suck.
[*][b]AIs[/b] - The AIs in this game is either insanely bad or insanely good after you maxxed out the perf limit on your rides. It's either you or them are going to be collecting dust always.
[*][b]RPG system and Grind[/b] - The Crew 2 involves a shitton of grinding and you better start praying to god you don't get trash parts so you can move on to cooking or do something else.
[*][b]Boat races[/b] - Who the hell at the HQ takes a dump and thinks this shit is a great idea?
[*][b]Customization[/b] - The Crew 2 is about fast, flashy cars, but offers weirdly bad customization, about visual parts I mean. [b]Because the vinyl system is even worse.[/b] Hell, you can't even search or [b]save[/b] vinyl designs. The search engine is incredibly horrible. You can get either the tops, or recents. Tag search isn't helping either. Forza franchise tops this. Ubisoft if you don't fix this, you won't even get a chance at a comeback ever.
   JDM fanboys, I'm sorry. You could barely customize R35 at all. No fat body kits, not even wheels.
[*][b]Weird Weather[/b] - It's a minor issue I have for immersion reason. Imagine chilling in summer and the next minute it's already snowing for a whopping 5 minutes.
[*][b]Weird vehicle lineup[/b] - Recently Nissan unveild '24 R35, and this game decides to add '15 model of it just now I don't understand why. I think they previously add the old '16 Yamaha M1 during around the 2021 MotoGP period too. Still waiting for more bikes like R1 and V4 by the way.
   I was so excited for F4U Corsair when it was leaked. Words can't describe my disappointment to think they already scrapped it.
[/list]

I'm still doubting if I should give this a thumbs-up, I really want to do the opposite. But I won't lie I find myself still enjoy chilling in this game. So thumbs-up it seems.",1674482586,1674483551,True,2,0,0.528774559497833252,0,True,False,False

Good game...
-Very large map
-Lots of camera angles (including cockpit)
-Lots of cars
-A few planes
-A few boats
-Lots of racing variety (16)
-Good enough graphics
-Customization: Vanity (tires, smoke, nitrous,tint) Livery sharing

However...
-Microtransactions
-Buy the Gold Edition or you won't get the permanent 20% vehicle price discount
-Limited edition cars (LIVE Summit exclusive) that you can only win in specific weeks (can't buy them)
-Can't customize Visual Parts (hoods, front bumpers, widebody, spoilers) on limited edition cars
-Very little camera shake, makes it boring
-Not very exciting special races, only 1 or 2

✅ Having a wide variety of races
✅ Races are very enjoyable
✅You can drive on the map or teleport directly to participate in the races.
✅ It is impossible to get bored with so many different types of vehicles
✅ Graphics are excellent

Why don't you buy this game?
❌ Vehicles are very expensive. You race with standard vehicles for a long time.
❌ The game is too expensive
❌ It's hard to level up

As far as i'm concerned I think that we both can agree(me and you(the reader(if you have played more than 2 or 3 hours))) that the game is particularly empty considering the astonishing quantity of the cities all around United States. I mean that there are only 11 cities on the map that are ""the most important"" or ""the best known"" cities. Some examples that come to mind and could have been added to the game are: Philadelphia Indianápolis San Diego Oklahoma Atlanta or even Austin. 
Another thing that I'd like to emphasize is the few amount of villages that are scattered on the map. For example If you go from Los Angeles to Miami you i'll get bored since there aren't much villages  that you can visit while the drive.
Lest's move on to another particularity of the game that it is Rubberbanding it's frightful. You are racing and without reason you get passed by another car just before the race is gonna end. This have happened to me a few times but i was really pissed off.
I'm not quite sure if I can recommend this game it's really fun but there are some things tha might ruin your experience.
I really enjoyed driving and the taxi missions are fun either but the for ex if you go full to the right the steering wheel moves a only a little bit and i felt that  hardly any realistic. The graphics are pretty well done.
[h1] So in conclusion [h1]
If you want a game to drive and waste some of your time going from a city to another is a good game. The races aren't thaaat bad but could have been much better
If you really want to feel an exciting expierence of driving i can recommend Forza Horizon 5 rather than this game.
I hope this was useful and have fun if you buy the game! :)",1674096864,1674096864,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The drifting is pretty easy to get the hang of and it's very fun to just drift around the map for hours on end. So if you have the money for this game. Get it.  Also @Ubi-SpaceCats i will probably not reach out to Ubisoft, because i can still play the game.

My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 30 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he friended and invited me to join him. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

Anything more than like 20 metres away looks like PS2 graphics. Game is capped at 60 FPS. Camera angles are very limited and you can't look around very well. City designs are a bit disappointing, VERY small cities that feel like they have no personality or detail. Highway ramps / interchanges look like they were made in unmodded Cities Skylines.

Only really positive thing about this game imo is that the game world is big, but with most of it being basically empty landscape and the handful of cities being like less than 10 city-blocks in any direction, it feels very hollow.

Got it on sale in the Winter Sale so I figured I'd at least doing a little virtual road trip to the grand canyon but the camera angle doesn't even let me get a good view while parked right at the edge, and the awful rendering quality for anything at a distance makes it look awful. The Crew 1 was better. Unless you are literally completely out of any racing content from other games, I don't think this game really offers anything. If you haven't played them yet I think you would get more value out of something like Burnout Paradise (even though it's like 14 years old) or picking up a Forza Horizon game on sale. As it stands I don't see myself really putting any more time into this as it's just not compelling despite it only being $12.

Not even really worth discussing the plane/boat stuff, it's not interesting and probably just waited a bunch of development time that took complicated the physics programming or took away from putting more work into building up the rest of the world or focusing on better game performance.

If Ubisoft makes another installment of The Crew, I suggest they return to only focusing on ground racing (mix of street, track, offroad, and maybe bike) and spend more time on making more responsive driving physics and a more polished game world... and maybe less gigantic 50 metre tall ramps randomly placed in the middle of city streets (kind of makes it hard to suspend disbelief).",1672361562,1672361562,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Ingredients:
1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.

I played a race on the hardest difficulty setting (Ace) with my car's performance equally matched with my AI rivals, and I can easily win races with a 5-second lead. (No, this isn't due to my skill level since I often lose races in multiplayer, it's simply due to easy AI).

The rubber-banding effect (at least on lower difficulties) is also extreme - I can crash out at the back of the pack and easily wind back up in 1st place by the end of the race. Even worse, the game forces you to play each event on the lower 2 difficulties before the hardest difficulty was unlocked, which is unnecessary and time-consuming.

(And no, I haven't tried purposely using underpowered cars just to make the single player races challenging, since this would be pure trial-and-error and would be unnecessary if the game offered a reasonable challenge).

The driving mechanics are also disappointing. As far as I can tell, there is virtually no drift, and it's completely impossible to spin out when cornering, meaning you can take most corners with the pedal to the metal simply by steering. (Even arcade racing games like Ridge Racer Unbounded require you to use skill when cornering so that you don't oversteer and spin out entirely). This makes the driving mechanics closer to Burnout or Mario Kart than a serious racing game. (I even tried tuning the controller settings and turning all driving assists to ""off"", but noticed very little difference).

There are also a few other oddities, such as planes getting stuck when hitting trees. But again, this is negligible. The fact that the game is time-consuming but offers little challenge and uninteresting driving mechanic's isn't. The only real saving grace might be the multiplayer (since all cars are upgraded for free when playing multiplayer and no mindless grinding for parts is required), however games like Forza Horizon 4 probably offer a much better multiplayer experience.

Overall, I don't recommend this game at all except for young children or people who don't play racing games with more realism than Mario Kart or Burnout. It's all flash, but very little substance, and seems to be more of a cash-grab than a well-designed product.

(P.S. I also think the publisher may be deleting negative reviews, since i recall this game's average rating being ""Mixed"" a few months ago, but all of a sudden it has hiked to ""Very Positive"").",1672129284,1672129483,False,3,0,0.553096115589141846,1,True,False,False

1. Criterion doesn't take the conventional 'hyper-realistic' route for Unbound and apparently some people like it as a change/dynamic/variety... BUT, unfortunately, TC2 balances it all. Ubi also tried to be different in addition to include every technological advancement/prowess at its time. (Criterion gave Unbound ray tracing, which isn't possible for TC2) TC2 also offers replayability value so it's a big win.
2. For the sake of story-telling/lore, Unbound takes a win here. However, TC2 never meant to be a singleplayer prodigy title. Ubi opened a blank new page to start a new journey. TC2 focused on vehicle optimization and gameplay features instead of storyline (that also explains TC2 story kinda stale/leaving players hanging)
3. Unbound rises rage and anxiety for many people (especially for the fact that Unbound being a $60/$70 game) while TC2 being the character it delivers. (TC2 already fine the way it is) TC2 tried and get improved overtime, so by now the player base is moderate enough for the skill ceiling, which is explained that Unbound definitely not ready (yet) as a competitive title.
4. Obviously, TC2 has microtransactions, but why does it even matter? IT'S ALL COSMETICS. I'm not gonna buy a brand new release merely for the lore. I bought this for 18 months and I feel so thankful that I can still play it until today, giving this a taste of RTX 3060 that my 'revolutionized' internet café has. I paid ONLY (due to exchange rate, so approximately) $7 for the whole experience (I'll continue my road to 100% assuming that I have the chance)

In conclusion, TC2 wins, at least from the perspective of a third world country. Let them feel the experience of Unbound, who you ask? people who ACTUALLY bought it. They always took money for granted. Having the privilege of better govt (policy) and stability, who doesn't want to live such an ideal life?

The sound of engines roaring and the sight of my competitors falling behind filled the screen, but I knew that I wasn't the one responsible for my victories.

I had always dreamed of becoming a top racer, but I had never been able to put in the time and effort necessary to get there. So I had resorted to cheating, using a macro to do the work for me.

At first, it had seemed like the perfect solution. I was able to dominate the tracks with ease, and I even started to receive offers from teams and sponsors. But as the accolades poured in, I couldn't shake the feeling that I wasn't truly earning them.

As the truth about my cheating was eventually uncovered, I was banned from the racing community and ostracized by my peers.

This game has little to no detail at all, graphics at ultimate settings look like roblox.

Map has no detail, roads look pixelated and it's really boring to drive around doing nothing.

Graphics:
Rather dull, dead looking colors with even the most beautiful of places lacking appeal.

Storyline:
Absolutely miserable. Both the Stories and the Storyline have the appeal of a 4th grader's fiction assignment.

Price:
The average person will likely quit fast, buy it on sale.

Difficulty:
Pretty easy when the game works well, extremely hard when the game bugs out. Keep in mind it's an arcade racer type game, meant to be repetitive and easy.

AI:
They aren't even really AI. The ""AI"" are just other cars with completely preset paths and decisions, making them rather easy to figure out and beat (sit in the back of a race and watch how every moves, now do it again. It will be identical).

Cutscenes:
Absolutely miserable. Ubisoft neglects cutscenes majorly and it shows. They all look like something you'd see in a 6th grade computers class where they're working with Prezi.

Fun:
It's fun when it works. Unfortunately, that's only half the time.

Sounds/Music:
They sucked. Bland noises and only pop/dubstep-like music.

Replayability:
I could 100% see replaying it... well, maybe not the whole thing. There's some things, like the 45 minute Hypercar race, which are just unbearable to do again. I could see how you could return to regular races though.

Controls:
Each class of cars feels absolutely horrible at first, but soon you'll have an extremely tight grip on it. You feel like you have total control of every car.

Performance:
Worse than Cyberpunk to power something that looks worse than 2012 NFS games.

Modding:
Unfortunately no mods will ever be publically supported by the game. Ubisoft decided that always-online with other players was the best approach, meaning there is no way to mod the game.

Selling Out:
Ubisoft has absolutely sold out.
- ""Special Edition""
- ""Gold Edition""
- ""Season Pass""
- In app purchases
- A literal battle pass (yes, in a racing game)

Similar Games:
I'd say anything in the Need for Speed series would be pretty similiar.

Bugs:
- Random crashes

The Crew 2 is such a fun and great game that you can play with your friends through the whole USA, there are many variety of races, vehicles and plenty other stuff you can do. You can choose from (more than 500 vehicles) to drive around in the New York streets or why not in LA. 

 For those who wondering, the handling of the cars is very good and pretty easy to ""controll"" which makes it so easy to drive compared to Forza and i love that. And yes you can also use boost:) so i highly recommend you buy it and do a test drive around the USA map. 

There is also a competition every week called The Summit which allows you to do events and score points against other players to get great rewards.

I have tried to change some settings (graphics) from medium to high to see how it could affect framerate but nothing really changed. I did not find a way to select a locked fps of 30 or 60fps in any menu (unless I am blind). But there is also no FOV slider and I found that playing and just simply driving around the map causes me to have headaches after 30 minutes, something I never experienced with Grid, NFS, Gran Turismo or Forza in my limited experience with those games. And this is really odd because my astigmatism usually triggers headaches for FPS and third person action games only, never an arcade/simcade racer game. I do not understand why it is happening with this game specifically.

My nephews have no issue with the game, so maybe it is really just me. They have fun, but even watching them play gives me headaches over time still. 

As an arcade racer, I can't really recommend this game. But for something different and on sale, it is a packed game for what it offers, but it really isn't for me.

Will I buy Crew 3? On sale maybe to give it another chance in the future. But this game, glad I didn't overspend on it with those DLCs or vehicle packs.

Original review is below.

-------

Bought it on sale. I see the map, and I see the amount  of content I ""could"" play through.

But one of the most fundamental elements is really bugging me, the handling of the vehicle (cars specifically). I know it isn't a simulation racer and is more ""geared"" towards an arcade-y  feel maybe but even on that front I feel it fails miserably.

I personally don't like how it handles. I don't know how the kids would like it though yet. So I can't pass full judgement yet. For now, I can't even recommend this on sale.",1669453548,1670241319,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Having access to a manual transmission mode is also nice to have. The graphics are great at times and awful at others; in terms of cars, most of them look really good, and the lighting is also decent as well, however the city-scapes and buildings don't look so great, and the cities in general feel pretty barren. The variety in vehicles is also nice, however I personally find myself almost exclusively using cars, unless its for a specific race; while the vehicles handle just fine, I find the game to certainly be more land-vehicle oriented.

Three years ago, I wouldn't recommend this game at all. The changes in its handling, physics, as well as how new content was delivered, were all terrible. The game went from enjoyable handling model to ""how the hell do i control this soap?""
Then as years passed, the game went through drastic changes, its only mistake being that those occurred in the span of [b]four[/b] years. 

The grind has been greatly improved, it isn't a second job anymore. Handling is fun with all its quirks and features, being tough to master but easy to get by. The premium motorpass (battlepass) has recently been made available for free if you've got enough in-game money (bucks) that is. The plethora of Motorflix episodes (new races being released monthly) are fun and very well made for the most part, altho the current latest events (Into the Storm) was a bit underwhelming as it had half as many events as the previous episodes, altho it has a lot of untapped potential. If you get the game now, you'll face a mountain of content waiting to be explored.

I'm glad I decided to revisit this game after all these years. It has become quite good since then, and is a nice break from games that attempt to incorporate more sim-ish models into their handling and physics. It's dumb fun, and that's all I could ask for.",1669462387,1669462387,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

You want to play street races no problem there is street racing mode. You want street race but faster sure there is Hypercar mode. You are bored of racing, you prefer drifting, well dont worry there is drift mode. You are more of a drag race mother*ucker, say no more they made drag race mode. Wait a minute i dont like street racing, i want to race on track with pro cars and F1 vehicles, okay we made that too so no worries. Well what is with people who like offroads and motorcycles, well we thought about them too, we made rally cross and motocross events so jump in and start playing. And thats just begining of playing, there are boats, planes, there is even military hovercraft, These guys thought on everything. So dont wait and buy this game and start playing it today.

I just come across a lot of issues. That being said, here is my issue. I have looked up plenty of tutorials and all of them I have followed. None of them have fixed it. I do not mind the low frame rate, my PC has old specs so it is to be expected. However, it is the constant frame drops that anger me the most. Cruising around I average 60 FPS (since it is capped at 60) with frame drops down to 0, and back up. Usually it is only for a few seconds at a time, however, occasionally it can last up until a full five seconds. I do not know about the other players, but I do not want to be going 200 MPH and not know where I am going for 2 seconds. Not just with cruising, but with in game events as well. Drifting puts my average frame rate to about 36 FPS (of which I am perfectly content with) but with frame drops happening every 3 seconds where my game would quite literally freeze for 1-4 seconds before resuming. Very. Infuriating. I have put all my graphics to low and exited all background applications with no results to show. Nothing has worked. Last time a developer has told me exactly what I have done already, so I will put this into another sentence to make it clear.

If I hear another person tell me to verify my files, disable background applications, turn down graphics, or use a trouble shoot wizard of some sort, I will lose my mind. These generic steps I have tried and do not work.",1655433284,1667715428,False,0,0,0.47999998927116394,0,True,False,False

I recently bought a Xbox official controller. I tried to use it in the game but when you try to change the key-binds, it does not even care what key-bind you set, it just keeps the stock key-bind and ignores what you told the game to set the key. Also, the stock controller key-binds are trash. Ex. Acceleration & Brake for the controller is automatically set to ""W"" and ""S"". I don't know of any controller that has ""W"" and ""S"" on it. Keep in mind, you can't change the key-binds, so you will just have to stick with a, ""One-hand-on-controller-one-hand-on-keyboard"" method of playing. 

On the plus side, the graphics are pretty good and the use of cars + planes + boats + motorcycles makes this game very diverse. The map is also huge with 80+ miles from one end to the other. I also like the use of real life cars, it makes the game feel more prestige with this addition.

If you look, my steam account has over 3400 hrs on beamNG.Drive, 3000 hrs on GTA V, and on my Microsoft account, 200 hrs on FH5. In my opinion, these are WAY better options for a ""Vehicle Simulator"" and these should be considered when you buy a car game. Overall, this would fall about 7th-8th place of the best car games iv'e played. (Iv'e played better Roblox games). And my score would be a 4.5/10

I hope this helped

Ubisoft already milked the game pretty dry, no need to appeal to Deck users. Such a shame as this would probably play well on the Deck and offer a still pretty much unique racing game experience (if you can ignore the battlepass crap, that is).

TL;DR: Getting shafted by what is essentially greed sucks, especially when the thing that you paid for doesn't actually deliver enough to be recommendable.

Such a shame it had to go this way, I really like the possibility to have cars, bikes, boats, airplanes and even hovercraft available in the same game, especially with the weekly time/score based competition.
Sadly, the game is lacking in almost every aspect and only very little has been and is being done about that.
- The performance is getting worse, despite the graphics not getting any better.
- Having to launch the uplay app every time I want to play this game is annoying, but I guess that is something we will have to live with these days, looking at how many other games have similar situations going on
- Content for most vehicles besides cars and bikes is running thin, there haven't been new tracks or vehicles or air and water based racing in a long time.
- There is next to no street or touring bike exclusive content, sure it's nice that they let you use bikes on the same tracks as the cars, but the bikes massively outperform the cars in PvE and there are only a few bike limited tracks in PvE and even less in PvP.
- The rate at which new cars get introduced is fine, I guess. What isn't fine is how overly expensive all the vehicles are when compared to the amount of cash you get as rewards.
- The micro transactions used to be completely optional, basically only allowing players to shorten the grind to obtain all the vehicles they want or need using a premium currency, but I guess that doesn't bring in enough money. So they decided to add cosmetics which are mostly unlocked using the premium currency, but as that somehow wasn't enough either they just couldn't resist following the most recent micro transaction content trend and introduce battlepasses. If this was a free to play, fair enough, but as you might spot on the store page, this isn't one, in fact, they even want you to buy the season pass. But as that isn't enough either they have made it impossible to collect enough premium currency to obtain their battle pass without paying at least 10€. To make it even more insulting, half of the currency you can earn during each ""season"" is locked behind the premium pass, the free rewards are extremely weak, however the rewards behind the paywall are vehicles that outperform the limited selection of non-premium vehicles you can get for the leaderboard (summit) events during the battlepass 'series' (season), rather than the usual, completely acceptable cosmetics.
- The fact that there are so many cars which you cannot get via gameplay but only via micro transactions by now is just not okay. Especially not when there are ranked activities which require a new class of vehicle and most of the vehicles of that class are locked behind that nasty paywall and the ""free"" ones are the worst performing ones.

As you might be able to tell, the last points are what drove me to post a review for this. I absolutely despise having micro transactions in games that already have a price tag up front, season passes are already bad enough on their own, but now you can't even expect those to grant you access to all content of a game you already paid for.
The Battlepass and the way they ""justified"" the recent changes is intolerable to me, not only did they take away the possibility to obtain the premium currency for free on daily basis, they also introduced loads of cars which are obtainable with the help of premium currency only.
So, why did they remove the possibility to obtain larger amounts of premium currency for free? From their announcement you can gather that they didn't want too many daily activities overlapping with eachother (fair enough, could have integrated the currency rewards into the ingame progression systems, but well, didn't happen) and, to no ones surprise, that they didn't feel like they got enough money out of the game to keep up the support for the game.
With that reasoning in mind I really get the feeling that they don't actually want this game or rather the series to keep going, choosing to go the lazy route, adding content that basically is just fancy reskins instead of improving and continuing the content that is already there.
I guess we will see how this will work out for them and wether or not this will mean the end for The Crew in the long term.",1607306666,1666652568,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

There is a lot of motorcycles and cars to choose which is amazing and they can be tuned and custom as u want.
Sounds are decent most motorcycles and cars sound like they real life versions even when downshifting (way better sounds than FH4)
Game is well optimised and it runs on UHD 630 on low preset at 55-70 fps
Its on a bigger side at 60 gb but the map size backs that up because the map is huge and it takes the same time to travel 100km as it would in real life.

This game has a greatly detailed and expansive open world. While you can quick travel to locations (and it can certainly be necessary to use quick travel on shorter gaming sessions.) taking the time to travel through the open world is highly interesting and rewarding. The game has many fleshed out major cities and suburb areas, incredible land marks like the grand canyon, and some cool sites like Cape Canaveral.

There is just about every type of race event you can think of. From boats to planes to cars and even hovercraft. You can do street races, demo derby, monster trucks, air stunt events, deliveries, and my favorite, drifting; just to name a very small few of the types of events you can partake in.

There is a really fun exploration mode where you are given an approximate location for a site to visit, but you must deduce specifically where to find the site. This mode has you traveling along various regions, often requiring you to manually drive from the previous location to the next location. At the end, you gain a special vehicle which can only be obtained by doing these events. It's very fun and very rewarding.

My gripes are:
* Handling and physics are a little to arcade style for my preferences.
* Progression through improvements and upgrades is uninteresting. 
* Specific cars only work for specific modes. If you get a rally car, you can't tune it to be used in street or drift races. The car is locked to the specific event type, so you can't use a rally car for street races (for instance) even if you wanted to.
* There is literally NO vehicle damage.
* The lack of a compelling story is moderately disappointing.
* Instead of ""Experience"" to level up, you gain social media followers. The more followers, the higher your influencer level.

""Experience"": Experience and levels being based on social media influence is the stupidest thing in this entire game. Social media being a plague to humanity is glorified and almost worshiped in this game. Don't quantify your self-worth based on ""followers"", ""likes"", and ""comments"". You're an incredible human and the sum of your worth is not by how you influence people because of pictures of food on some website, but by your own personal accomplishments and not by what other people think of you.

Handling gripes and suggestions: I'd like to see slightly (or vastly) more realistic physics as an option and then group people into lobbies or shards that use a similar level of realism.

Progression gripes and suggestions: Once you get a max level set of parts for one road car, you can use those same parts in any other road car. It works like this for all vehicle types. Unlock max set once, use the same parts in any other vehicle of the same type. It's boring. I'd like to see cars upgrade more gradually and with a greater level of verbosity to the part names, descriptions, and the effect that the parts have on the vehicle. Instead of obtaining car parts exclusively as ""loot"" for winning an event, simply lock parts behind player level and/or car level as well as cost requirements. The ""affix"" and ""set bonus"" system is just silly and weird to me.

Tuning gripes and suggestion: Allow any car to be used in any car event and rely on the tuning of the vehicle to allow it to enter specific events. Have a rating for race types that your car needs to meet before it can enter the event. If your car has a high rating for rally but a low rating for street racing (due to how it's setup via selected parts), then the car won't be allowed to engage in the street race until you equip parts that increase the street racing performance.

Vehicle damage gripes: Why is there no vehicle damage? This game is so incredibly detailed and vast. I would like to see some kind of vehicle damage. It doesn't have to be BeamNG Drive levels of detail, but some kind of vehicle damage system would be preferred.

Story gripes and suggestion: I know a lot of people don't care about stories and often skip through them, but I enjoy them. The seeming lack of a story in this game, while being minor when considering the scope of the game play, is still disappointing. Any kind of story presented is a generic ""I'm going to beat you in this race!"" ... ""What you won?! How dare you beat me!"" and forgoes any sort of deeper plot.

All in all, I really like this game but it could be made so much better. This game suffers Quantity over Quality. And while the quality of a large portion of the game is very high, some portions were overlooked or intentionally made less complex for the sake of casual audiences. 

I think the thing preventing me from playing until my eyeballs bleed is: the progression and parts system. I got my car upgraded to max on the first sitting. ""Need for Speed: Heat"" has a far more compelling upgrade system. Considering the depth and scale of this game, I'm surprised they went with such a shallow system for progression.

Do buy if: You want a *gigantic* and detailed open world with an almost uncountable number of diverse race events and endless things to do.

Don't buy if: You want realism or interesting progression.",1666203235,1666204093,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Despite the game's obvious arcade nature, it feels surprisingly good - the cars are heavy, react differently to various surfaces, and the level system provides fair balance in online racing. This game is a good racing game to introduce genre to your friends - it doesn't require a wheel to play, and the diversity of content will always allow you to rest a little and play around with different activities and achievements.

No co-op missions, and the gameplay is geared towards playing short races for small money for hours to get enough money for decent cars. Or, you can spend an extra $40 to $70 for credits and hopefully get the more top of the line model. That is per vehicle price. Outrageous. The skill box are useless as it is all about the part rating number. Skills have little impact. 

I try to interact with others and create/join crews, but the conversations are limited to preset emojis and tag lines. Often leading to long games with no one in the maps. And when there are other players, everyone pretty much lone wolfs. 

Buy the game on sale = or >50% off and you get some good play out of it. Buy it at full price and you will be disappointed. Don't bother buying credits. Waste of real money as the new vehicles shine rubs off very quickly, so you will not get your money's worth. As mentioned above, a new car can cost more than buying the game.  Other comments already cover about the Season Pass as well. Base game is enough for a few weeks of fun, if you didn't pay full price.

Biggest disappointment is the Motor Pass and how you have to buy it in order to unlock the items you win with achievement points that are earned by grinding. Otherwise, you can look at the item you have enough points for, but can't get it unless it is ""free"". Anything  that looks cool will cost more credits than you can earn in the game.  Again, only recommend the game if on sale. 

UPDATE: Came back to this game and saw a neat update. There were ""step"" missions to earn vehicles. After a few hours to complete one mission the award was a crap car. not really worth the replay. Uninstalled again.

There are so many different weird and cool vehicles you can buy and race with and there is near endless content as they add new types of races pretty frequently, on top getting better parts for your cars, rolling their stats to match the types of races they are for (The RNG on parts isn't too harsh either) tons of things to find and challenges to do in the open world and being able to race planes and boats too just adds to the variety

Now all that being said, I'd still say wait for the game to go on sale (it does pretty often) since giving Ubisoft a significant amount of money is not something I'd recommend anyone do",1666117402,1666117850,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The Crew 2 is a strong competitor to the open-world live service arcade racing genre. Visually flashier than the first game, but also lacking in unique locations and a move away from embracing the full continental US experience. 

The driving is great with a little bit of understeer here and there being common. There's also a ton of vehicles to get and 16 racing styles, including things like monster truck rallies and dirtbike races. 

Overall, it's a game full of content with a ton to do, though the overall atmosphere suffers as a result of the switched focuses.",1666108035,1666108035,True,5,0,0.525209724903106689,0,True,False,False

That wasn't the case either, since drifting is basically nonexistent and the input delay paired with the 60 FPS hard cap makes it unplayable.

If you like a long explanation, here is mine:

When the game first came out, it was Wonderful. there were in game events, stuff to do, fun to be had, friends to play with, etc. the items on the shop werent too bad, you could earn in game credits to buy shop stuff. cars were easy to tune and fun to drive. that was over a year ago. i stopped playing then because there was an update they did where you couldnt earn coins to buy stuff in the store anymore. there were reaccuring bugs with the land/ground where the cars glitched through. the sound would come and go as it pleases, and the graphics would stutter. (No, not a computer issue. i checked.) 

Coming back to this game, playing on 10/13/2022, this game isnt worth it too me. The glitching of the cars through the ground seems to be fixed. however you are still not able to earn coins via events or races. so you have to use real money to buy extra items for your car. (Note: most of these items are cosmetic). The Graphics are still stuttery, but not as bad as they used to be. the sound goes out on some cars. you sometimes hear the squeal of the tires or the engine, other times you dont hear anything, just the whine of the turbo like its an electric motor. not cool, especially for us manual shifters who base it off of sound. the community in game seems dead. i hardly saw anyone anywhere when i explored the map. i even hung around the old popular spots like the dock or the rally race tracks, and the demolition arena. only one or two were there, but just afk. it use to be Full of people all the time. was so much fun. 

So, in all, I would Not recommend this game. it is a waist of money now, and the fun you would have had in the beginning has died out. If a third game were made, i most likely would not buy it.

The Crew 2 is a giant open world racing game where you can use land air water vehicle to compete in the world. You, the main protagonist will participate in LIVE event to reach to top/podium of the event and defeat the champions on each four factions.

There isn't much story to tell except to beat the champions as mentioned above, so if you are looking for a story driven racing game, this is not the game for you to get pumped because of the story as it has none. I would say this game is on the dumb fun side so you can do whatever you like in this game.

With that being said, let’s talk about the gameplay, The Crew 2 packs with multiple driving physics depending on the class/faction you picked. Providing you unique driving experience for each factions, but not all driving physics are excellent to say, as a matter of fact some of the faction driving physics is borderline bad, for example drifting gives you zero feedback as if you are just swaying your ride and pray it don’t sway to a wall for no reason. 

Having a large roster of rides provides you choices to pick your favorite ride and customize it, most of the customization doesn’t include licensing so Ivory Tower went ham with how the body parts look like compared to Need for Speed/Forza as you can do so much with licensing.

As for monetization this is one of the grindiest racing games I've played for a long time. You basically have to keep grinding the longest race to get the car you like and then re-do it all over again, making it feel like a chore. However, the more you play the game you get comfort points to increase your stats so you could have 10% nitro boost or increased payout/experience gained in a race, making it very friendly for veteran players to grind. The game also rocks with the battlepass system so you can get limited edition themed cars and cosmetics, unfortunately there’s no way for you to earn premium currency anymore. 

If you want to get competitive, there’s always weekly ranking system where you get rewarded with cosmetic for doing well in ranking, but do be warned though, platinum ranking is filled with veterans and tryhards you probably need a friend or two get you through the rankings.

In conclusion, the game is pretty cool, I find this fun because it’s a no brainer racing game to relax yourself with. If you ever consider buying this game, probably wait for the discount, it’s a lot better. 7.5/10",1614357878,1665164343,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Now, the negative review is about what is happening with Ubisoft - their launcher does not function properly, so they do not want to fix it for ""older operating systems"". So despite that the game runs great and smoothly, the launcher doesn't. Making new friends is impossible and inviting old ones to play with you together is impossible, too. Ubisoft needs to have a serious talk with their developer team:

I really tried to get this game to work for me, in the sense of enjoying it. Trust me, I really did. But sadly, I could not. *Spoiler Alert:* I do make a lot of comparisons  between the Crew 2, vs Forza Horizon 5 and Need for Speed: Heat, so watch out.

I was not aware until I purchased the game that this is one of those Pay to Win games (P2W) . Where if you want a car, even an average one, if you don't have enough credits, you gotta pay real cash. It does not help that the Devs intentionally make Credits hard to come by. Even worse, some cars are locked behind seasons pass or seasonal only, meaning you can not get it unless you buy a special pack, or happen to be here at the right time in order to obtain it.

In contrast, Need for Speed: Heat and Forza Horizon 5 make Credits easy to come by, especially the later, and Forza Horizon 5 practically gives you cars as you progress through the game. 


As for the map, which was my main selling point for buying the game, unlike Forza Horizon 5, the map may be huge, but it's mostly empty with few details outside the major cities. Another thing that disgusted me was the outdated and bland customization system. You have no access to community made logos/decals, and what little you have, can only be applied to 16 cars in the game. That's right, you can only customize 16 cars before you have to delete a skin. You can not even have more than one skin for the same car. This is something that makes nearly no sense. In contrast, Need for Speed Heat while it does not give you access to community decals, does give you plenty of decals to choose from, and you can have up to 100 skins for your cars, including the ability to make more than one skin for a car. And as for Forza Horizon 5, while I have not hit a hard limit, (I do have more than 70 skins made, including community ones), in theory lets you have unlimited skins, and community made decals.

In conclusion, while a good number of games do have micro-transactions (what game does not these days?), including this one, the system really does not belong in racing games. Unlike some games like those of War Thunder, and World of Warships, which have little to no competition, The Crew 2 has plenty of lower cost, non P2W, non micro-transaction racing games available. There are so many that it would be impossible to list them all.

So in the end, unless you do not mind spending a lot of extra cash on this game, I would advise you to look elsewhere.",1663373453,1663373453,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

mind you, the crew 1 and 2 both requires constant internet connection to hop on servers as there's no offline singleplayer mode; therefore one day very soon, you lose access to the crew 1 ,and after a few years, to the crew 2 'cause servers will be closed down. same thing happened to Far Cry 3 and a few other games where you can't have online content from DLCs you paid for, because they shutdown servers and didn't even bother to release any patch to port multiplayer coop missions against AI to single player mode. this practice must be stopped!!

This is like a large open-world of the entire United States and you can drive around freely and then join different types of events as you want. Otherwise you can just drive around from city to city or to other locations and get on the highways to race with other real players. I like that this game is not too punishing for getting damage to your car and you car gets quickly auto-repaired in like one minute by itself so this game is not too serious or stressful. So you can make mistakes and crash a lot if you are just learning as a new player. I play this game with xbox 2 elite joystick but other players use the actual steering wheel and gear shift gamepads also. This is a pretty accurate simulation of actual car driving and you can keep driving around for hours freely in the open-world environment or join any races, speed traps, do courier missions to deliver items, look for special loot boxes for rewards, etc. You can also get off the main road and drive through the deserts, fields, and any other terrain on the sides of the road it's all part of the open-world terrain.

The racing itself fun for most part aside from feeling like you're racing toys in a static make-belief world which to be fair is the definition of racing videogames, but this one shows it better than anything especially with how all the performance parts are interchangeable between different brand cars. Up next is the dialogue: that was cringe beyond cringe so as an avid fan of cringe even i had to mute it cuz it was just too unbearable, like it was hazily written by some drunken dudebro degenerate. Of course it has a ""battle pass"" which locks away the coolest lookin cars... what else what else did they lock, oh right the fps to 60, thanks again consoles.

pros-
it does not take itself too seriously 
is multiplayer
is fun
multiple types of races, hours of content and multiple types of vehicles 


cons-
can be buggy at times 
quite pricey for a 2018 game

well aside from it being buggy and quite pricey id say this is overall an 8/10 racing game

There are many people that say it is the worst driving game, but personally, I feel that it is one of the best, I even prefer it to Forza. It was great diversity and has a very fun and interesting feel to it and Forza just doesn't get. I love the map and the races and activities are great. It's a great game to relax to.

I just wish however that the graphics were a little better, although the new graphics update has helped. Maybe there were some more cars (although not too many as I feel that too many cars is also a problem). The car sounds are okay but they could be better. I will say however that the races are very easy, and there is almost no competition (unless you do PvP), personally this isn't and issue for me but others may find it to be.

Positives:
- There is a lot of content, and not the usual boring and filler material. So many types of races, including destruction derby, bike races and boats will keep you busy.
- It is easy to upgrade cars, you get a lot of materials to upgrade. Live Summit changes every week and provides good rewards so leveling up is easy.
- This game has one of the best ways to display the map that I have seen in a racing game. 
- On Normal level, it is an easy game, so I play the race on normal and win, then try it on hard (and win again most of the time). 

Negatives: 
- Ubisoft
- In a lot of races, you race against a ghost and there are no other drivers.
- Soundtrack is mediocre. Racing games like NFS and Forza have one of the best soundtracks, something you enjoy while driving, but not here. Very okish. 
- Graphics are good, but at some places, houses look like boxes. 
- Online component is dead.

I also find the plane controls pathetic, although I am not sure if others feel this too.

Overall, it is worth the money. Get the gold edition, so that you have a headstart with extra cars and content.",1660847232,1660847232,True,17,2,0.720332562923431396,0,True,False,False

I prefer the photography in this game as it's much simpler to use (though fh5 does have more camera like settings). While this game is now FIVE YEARS OLD, they still update it regularly with summits every week, new vehicles every couple months or so and even have improved the graphics with some nice new shaders. While this older game cannot compete with many new games with newer graphics engines and optimisations behind the scenes, this game makes it easy to lose yourself or play the same race over and over. 

So thank you Ubisoft for a great game and I do really hope for a third version!",1660796891,1660796891,True,0,0,0.493827164173126221,0,True,False,False

The customization is amazing, there are dozens and dozens of different parts for each of the nearing 400 vehicles, including a livery creating system to make and share skins with the community. The Crew 2 also has a big variety of vehicles, including my favorite, the DMC DeLorean (though I hope sometime soon they'll add tesla vehicles to the game!).

Extra comments: Game is very grindy and not very F2P friendly as a lot of the meta vehicles are locked behind motorpasses, meaning you can't get them anymore. Also, if you want the Platinum rank in a Live Summit, good luck. You'll basically have to know every single little time save and trick in order to get Platinum.

That was three years ago and I think its about time I gave this game a fair review. Before I bought this game I was playing the TC1 (the first crew game). It was AMAZING and I never played anything like it. It was where ""fast and furious meet need for speed"" it was cool as crap man. The only thing that I really hated about it was the excessive amount of traffic cars in EVERY RACE. All they had to do was take out the traffic cars out of most of the races (this does not inclued open world driving, hot pursuits, and other small events). Other than that the game would have Achived perfection.

 Then the second game came out; and boy where do I start?

The game itself had some really good features such as vehicle customizing (I think they thought it through very well), cars that were not added to the first game, avatar selection(even though you couldn't change the avatar at all Which sucked). The motorflix which the most recent updates thus far was in fact pretty fun (except ""The Chase"", that one sucked really bad). There was some stuff out of the ordinary and it was really
fun and different and it was something to enjoy and it really changed things up in a good way.

However the game has more cons than pros, and prepare to get burned Game Makers.

Most of the vehicles in this game are worthless. There are over 500 vehicles and only about 50 of them are any good. In my opinion they wasted a lot of time getting at least half of those cars in the game, and believe me I test drove over 400 of them(yes that how many I own in the game). I did however like having a good variety. But to in all honesty: HOW MANY MORE CARS DO YOU NEED TO PUT IN THE GAME?! I mean seriously its like their trying to turn this this game into Forza Horizon.  

There are no cops in this game( so if you don't like hot pursuits you don't really need to read this part). I'm a huge NFS fan and I love a good hot pursuit. After I bought the game and then found out that there will be no hot pursuits added, I was pissed. Because in the previous game those event gave a variety of fun. Seriously it never got old, and it was a good money maker when it came to buying cars. They wanted to GIVE the game a ""MOTORSPORT THEME"". They thought that ""Legal racing was the way to go in this game"". Boy are you guys so wrong. I got so bored doing the same races over and over and over. Even with all the current updates I still get bored playing this game. This is one of the biggest reasons I think this game sucks.
Oh and F.Y.I. one of the latests updates called ""The Chase"" is an absolute insult to all NFS fans.

There are no faction races. ( not yet at least). In TC1 they had Faction Races, those were the best races and the best money makers. A few of those race took me 3 and a half hours to complete and they were SO MUCH FUN!!!!!! I hope they add them to TC2, because if they don't, the game will just become a bigger disappointment. 

There not much of a story line. Now keep in mind this was not much of a disappointment, however there is no plot and it made the game a little dull. Basiclly it was: go in, do a few race and kick the champ's ass. Thats all it is and it sucks. However with the moterflix added it did change some things up, but there no main plot and I'm still disappointed.

The Motocross Discipline: So back when the game was new the dirt bikes were fairly easy to handle, although the handling wasn't perfect, it was still fun. Then a few years have past and then an update came out, that update was supposed to improve the experience of the dirt bikes or something like that.
But the game makers screwed that up too. The handling ended up being soooooooo much worse and its frustrating to play now. I MEAN SERIOUSLY!!!! HAVE THOSE MORONS (referring to the game makers) EVER RODE AN ACTUAL DIRT BIKE DIRT BIKE!?!?! ITS NOT THAT HARD!!! I own one and last I checked the handling is not that difficult! They should of left that alone, it was fine the first time. 

Boats and planes: It was fun to an extent but some off it got really frustrating. I'm a fan of Ace Combat and I'm a pretty good pilot. Handling the planes in this game was a little tough however. I got the hang of it but I still wish I had the same control setup as ace combat. I tried too make the setup a little similar, BUT GUESS WHAT!!!!! THE BLOODY GAME WOULD NOT LET ME!!!!!
WHAT THE HELL!?!?!
 As for the boats: having them in the game was cool and like the planes there was a little trick to winning races in them. The powerboats weren't bad, but when it came to the jetsprint boats, lets just say I was not a happy camper. Seriously! LEAVE THE BOATS AND PLANES OUT THE CREW GAME!!!!!!! They just don't belong. This was another big reason why I think this game sucks.

You have the summit, the online racing and a very similar mapping setup which was all well and good. But then they took the best stuff out and replaced it with garbage and then managed to flush down the toilet. I've seen people screw up sequels, but DAMN!!! This is ridiculous. ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS MINIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF TRAFFIC CAR BEING SEEN IN THE GAME AND GIVE IT A NEW STORY LINE AND THE GAME WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECT!!!!!!!!! BUUUT NNNNOOOOOOOOOO!!!!! YOU JUST HAD TO GO IN AND RUIN IT!! And at this point there just constantly adding a high dose of suger to dog crap.

I'm sorry, but you don't just go and take a wonderful game and turn it to garbage with a sequel. I think thats the biggest disappointment of them all. If you like motorsports then I do recommend this game. But if your like me then save you money because I give this game a big fat noooo. I just hope that the game makers read this review and take it into serious consideration when making the The Crew 3 if they plan on it.",1597643965,1660389890,False,12,1,0.596840143203735352,0,True,False,False

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, got my car and map and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

Major downside is, the game is online only. No internet connection, you can't even play single player. It also means one day this game will be totally dead and unplayable.

Overall, considering the downside, I can only give a 6/10 rating.

Had a lot of fun with this one. I bought the base game on sale for 10 bucks. The season pass isn't necessary as it just adds more cars and a slight discount in the game store, but you don't need it, you just gotta play and earn stuff that way which to me is more fun. 

I'm really glad there's actually characters and narratives that kept me interested. A lot of racing games are just go here, do the race, go to the next one, etc etc. But here the story, leveling up, loot and characters made it feel like I was aiming for a goal. 

There's a TON of stuff to do. Street racing, hyper car racing, drag, drift, power boats, air races,  rallycross, hovercraft, motocross, touring, demolition derby, and MONSTER TRUCKS!!!! Those were my favorite. It's all arcadey feeling, so you can turn your car in mid air and stuff like that. There's also HUGE JUMPS which are so much fun. Plus there's loads of side activities like taking photos of landmarks, animals, stunts, etc, and escape missions, speed traps to name a few. Not to mention weekly events (called Live Summit) that have leaderboards and rewards are based on how many points you rack up against other players. 

On top of all that there's these really cool movie like scenarios called Motorflix where you have to either do events for movies, or smash vehicles like youre in Burnout 3. AND there's treasure map type missions where you get clues and have to find the specific area and take a picture, which when all are completed you'll get a nice reward. All of it is completely optional. You don't have to do every single event in any section to progress. I jumped around a lot. When I got tired of races, I'd jump into some drag races, monster trucks, photo ops, live summit or the motorflix. Just whatever you wanna do.

Speaking of rewards, this game gives them out nicely. Not just cars either. You can get parts, cool visual stuff like neon underglows or colored tire smoke or nitro colors. It's basically a dopamine simulator. 

Got all the achievements, completed the live extreme series and did over 70% of street racing, offroad, freestyle, and pro racing events. I also did all three seasons of motorflix and part of season six. There's still a ton of stuff left to do if I wanted as well.

The only stuff I didn't like was that since you can fast travel to any event, there isn't much reason to drive around the world. Kinda wish they would take a Forza Horizon approach and have billboards and fast travel boards scattered around to encourage this, but the way the whole game is set up is still really fun. I wish the game had more steam achievements too since there's so many things to do and unlock in game. Kinda surprised they had em in the first place considering it's a Ubisoft game. But the worst part is it's online all the time, which means when Ubi shuts down the servers the game will be dead, probably. So it's possible the game has an expiration date, unless they let people play it single player. 

And let me point out that while the game is called The Crew 2, I basically played almost the entire game by myself. I joined a crew for a little bit and did some stuff, but then I guess I got kicked out but all of my progress was still there so no big deal.",1659401117,1659401212,True,30,0,0.76624065637588501,0,True,False,False

Cons: Pretty much everything else

I overall enjoy TC2 but it's very much an arcade game before anything else, consistency and predictability are not there for those who want to challenge themselves for lap times and such. It turns into a grindfest very fast and the constant barrage of Ubisoft sh*t to keep those dopamine hits coming gets old. There's a constant battle against RNG factors that honestly just gets tiring. The ""tuning"" adds another layer of personalization, but it feels more like a band aid for the lackluster handling model and just another minigame to get the highest numbers somewhere.

I love the idea but despise the execution as it's the epitome of modern Ubisoft ""game design."" Usually I'm the type to say git gud but can't reasonably expect anyone to sit through the grind this game calls for. Games need to stop relying on spoonshoveling mountains of garbage into kids' mouths and get back to making genuinely entertaining experiences. The racing genre has a million opportunities for innovation, stifling that for more microtransactions and RNG mechanics just shows how gutless and disconnected this medium has become.",1659381265,1659381265,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

PLEASE NOTE, even though I have left comments on, I am not interested in you telling me that I should put 4000 hours into a game I don't enjoy so I can ""git good"", and then I would like it. That is a stupid argument. Don't be stupid. Skill is not indicative of enjoyment, and I have better things to do than bash my head on what I personally feel are bad / mediocre games on the off chance I could maybe like them one day. I have a life and don't play games to develop Stockholm syndrome.

Neutrals:
- There are 25-minute single races. In an arcade racing game. I hated this. You may not.

Pros:
- Most of the time, it ran at 60 FPS.
- Large map, but...

Cons:
- There is little to see on the map that's interesting. Sometimes the trees change type, and maybe there's more water in an area.
- The upgrade system is painfully bad and is essentially a lootbox minus a box. You win a race, you get some random upgrades. You can have, say, LVL 65 in every part but one and it may take you 20 races to get an upgrade for that slot. Yes, you can get RNG'd into having to grind races to upgrade. It's as bad as it sounds.
- VERY hard to read tracks when racing. Sometimes you'll just go in the wrong direction because you have no clue where you are intended to go. You essentially have to watch the minimap because watching the race itself is useless as the tracks are signposted more poorly than any other racing game I've played in recent memory.
- The AI is tuned incredibly poorly. Either they're WAY ahead of you even though you're driving a better car and the race is half your level, or you're absolutely demolishing them. There is no adjusting this. It is infuriating.
- All the cars control like they're racing on butter. Everything slides uncontrollably and really shows off how shoddy the physics are in this game. You will constantly careen into stuff. And speaking of...
- Hitting damn near anything brings you to a complete stop. You don't slide past stuff like other arcade racing games when the corner of your car clips a bush, you come to a complete halt. You now have to restart the race because you WILL NOT catch up. Is the race 12 minutes long? Too bad. Now to find that race reset...
- The menus are awful. I had to actually Google how to restart a race and quit the game. Thought they'd be in the in-game menus? Hah, you simpleton! You have to hit Y to bring up a special menu that hides in the corner of the screen, but only comes up while driving! Want that menu on a keyboard & mouse? NOPE! Those buttons sometimes show up at the bottom of a different menu where you may have expected them in the first place! Well, sometimes. Only when the option for the buttons feels like appearing. Sometimes it just doesn't.
- The characters are astoundingly annoying and are written to speak like a Red Bull commercial. The overtly positive ""might as well be saying nothing at all"" style garbage non-speaking flows out of everyone's mouth continually. The story is non-existant. If you love chasing ""followers"" (ugh), then go on Instagram and be vapid there. Even the shell of a life you pretend to have there will be more fun than The Crew 2.
- Very odd and frequent framerate drops when physics items interact with each other. This happens often. Adjusting settings did not help.
- It looks worse than the original did somehow, and the first was quite an ugly game.
- One of the worst game soundtracks I've heard since Gone Home. This low-budget mess of a soundtrack complete with incredibly shrill lady-punk songs. The only good song on the soundtrack is Airbourne - Running Wild, and it's over 10 years old. Yes that's an opinion, and your mileage may vary.
- I am an idiot and preordered the Gold Edition because, hey, this is a sequel. It's going to improve on the original in many ways. (Narrator: ""It did not."") They didn't listen to a single damn complaint about the original, even though nearly every review both professional and amateur said the same things (Many of which are pointed out in my review here). This makes me madder. You couldn't even be bothered to fix the obvious? Bad form, Ubisoft.
- They haven't improved on any of these complaints since launch and instead insist on putting out boring Live Events. This is because Live games make more money (See Destiny). Make no mistake, this is a product, not art and it definitely wants all of your money.
- I genuinely tried to like it and power through some of the issues, but I just can't any more. I hate this game. It is one of the worst racing games I have played in recent memory. Even the two most recent Need For Speed games were better, and they were mediocre at the best of times.

UPDATE:
Tried it again several years down the road. Holy god there is so much seasonal crap slathered everywhere, and random things to level that they're trying to sell you it was nearly impossible to figure out what to do next. This somehow got even grosser than it was. Oh, and even though the menus have changed, they now make LESS sense due to the sheer amount of layered-on garbage that, AND I still couldn't find a way to quit.

Now, 43 hours later I find myself that I can't stop playing and not planning on stopping.

Ok, I purchased game couple days before motorpass started so that was good way to get started and get prepared for new motorpass.

Let's talk about what I like and what I dislike/would change or improve:
Graphics:10/10
Weather and day/night: 10/10
Cars: 10/10
Amount of vehicles: 10/10
Amount of events/ amount of what to do in game: 10/10

Ok, so from playing this many hours game definitely doesn't feel like grind fest or that you have to pay real money to progress. Game actually feels sit back and relax, if you buying cheapest cars from every category than it's easier rather than grinding to buy most expensive cars.
It took me first 20 hours to save up $2.3 million to buy my first bugatti. now I can do it quicker, BUT instead of going for RICH perk, I went for FAMOUS perk and can get 100k followers every 30 minutes. I prefer followers over money.
Currently icon 300 so not bad going.
But back to the cars and legendary upgrades and perks. I thing I aboslutely hate and it's not having presets!
I mean how hard is to have preset for every car, for example Bugatti with followers preset and second preset would be skills doubled. I really do hate constaly swapping and finding the correct set I have to the other one. This can take several minutes!

Map, is absolutely huge. Plenty to do and also different climates.
Let's move onto tasks. This is another thing I personally would change is that completing race on easy difficulty count as compelted towards your 100% completetion. INSTEAD of this should count as 0.3% and you would have to complete all 3 difficulties to count towards 100% completion. Yes it is easy, but it would make player to play harder difficulties.
Once car is fully upgraded even ACE difficulties are bit easy, i wish it was harder than it is now.

I played PVP for 2 races, not big fan of PVP to be honest, so not gonna leave feedback other than not a lot of peope playing it as waiting time was over 4 minutes and only got 4 players.
Not very popular.

SUMMIT on the other hand is fun, great challenge against other players, making you try and try over and over again to get better scores. And has great rewards. I do like this one.

MOTORPASS again I enjoy this with great reward. BUT, what i don't enjoy is that motorpass still has 56 days left and i completed it already meaning all those daily/weekly challenges are pointless sometimes even summit has 30 token as reward which is so pointless. AGAIN why they couldn't make further small rewards after stage 50 in motorpass for people who completed it just so they don't feel like for next 55 days all these daily/weekly challenges are absolutely uselles with 0 reward!
Motorpass was easy, but didn't expect to complete this early...bit of waist from now

Flying planes: Controls are horrible and i struggle a lot especially in summit and this is one of my weakness that i can't get 100k in flying through zones. Not my favourite

Lastly when you trying to climb leaderboard in crew2.
First you learn track/circuit AND THEN once you know track you learn all the shortcuts. In crew2 you could be the best racer, but if you don't know shortcuts you will never get to the top of leaderboard.

Just imagine New York hypercar takes 33 minutes without shortcuts OR 24 minutes with shortcuts. 9 minutes saving!

Final verdict: I got gold edition with huge discount to play for 2 hours and then refund. That was my intention. Now still playing it a lot.
Fully recommended, still full of players. Don't think it's worth it for full price, but it is fun game.
My bigest complain are not being able to do presets on cars for different legendary upgrades. That was my biggest hate. Otherwise all positives ;)

i played an hour and forgot to shut off the game for the next 5 hours so ignore the 6h playtime of original review

the game literally use a minigun and throw you pop-up, notifications, rewards, unlocking, etc..... the first hour you play you just cannot play for how much the game wants you to know about every single events and whatnot.... after having skipped 90% of cutscenes and barely read what the events are.....i was just left in game who felt like playing a sandbox game like Garry's Mod.....the game don't tell you what to do and you do as you want......ok but when you start you should have some place to be brought at that isn't a tutorial that teaches you how to inhale and exhale with your lungs



the gameplay feel like Forza Horizon as an ''off brand knockoff''......the steering is unresponsive...the only way i could say it actually is, is by using a steering wheel to drive around.....the fps maxed at 60fps also make the game not as responsive as it could so...expect a lot of imput lag as if you were playing in 30fps




side note to the Dev team.........can you fix the launch of the game? having an ssd with an i7 12700k taking 30+ sec just to launch is disgusting.................oh and the 2nd time i opened the car market to check what i was supposed to have with the season pass made the game crash...uppon going back i got what i was supposed to have",1658367186,1658367186,False,4,4,0.512245357036590576,0,True,False,False

I was expecting something along the lines of Forza Horizon but instead got a cheap NFS Payback Knock off. this is an arcade type racing flying boating game and nothing really more. the story makes little sense and the dialogue is random and confusing most of the time. the Hiro character never seems to stop talking. The sounds for cars and objects have little variety so everything sounds the same and crash noises also sound the same weather you plow into a wall head first or barley tap a cone. the GPS and map system bug out 40% of the time which can be confusing and get you lost during races and events.

The car racing part is quite enjoyable; if you like Forza Horizon and similar you will feel at home with this game. The map is quite large and it is very well made in terms of replicating various areas of USA. The areas are quite small and not reflecting their real counterpart but it feels like being in New Mexico, Los Angeles, Seattle or New Orleans, so good job on that.

The driving model is OK; it is not a simulation by any means so don't expect each car to drive considerably differently as they would do in more simulated games; but at the same time the fact that the game is more arcade allow you to do fun things while driving. AI cars are few and in between but they are there, and crashing won't affect anything.

The game is based on missions for most part, you progress by collecting prizes and using money to buy new vehicles; so nothing you haven't see already. The fun part is mostly the various events, which are kinda like Forza Horizon; where you participate in specific race categories or events that put you in various setup and conditions to win those races. You can play at your own pace and you can even totally ignore the main competitions and just focus on side events, like the taxi driving missions or the delivery missions and so on. You also have a house where to store your stuff and various areas where you can see your avatar walking around; but it is not GTA: can't get out of the car at any time or there is anything to do on foot, it is mostly for looks

Being a Ubisoft game you can expect monetization and it is there in your face; the game expect you to pay money to buy the usual pass for more content and in game currency to get upgrades for your cars (which are basically like loot in rpg/shooter games, with different color and rarity). I didn't spend a penny simply because I don't even play online, so to me the improvement of the vehicles is something that is relative; but if you play online a lot, you will feel pressured to upgrade your ride or spend a lot of time grinding for parts.

There are also hidden cache spread through the map; you will hear a sonar beep when close by and it is a matter to run around remote areas to find those boxes, which will give you parts and cosmetics at random.

Other than that, there are not that many negatives; I never tried the ""crew"" feature, which is one of the main selling point of the game, but I don't play online nor I care, so YMMV. 
It is a nice game that you can play even to just roam around doing side missions, in a semi-realistic setup; and it is entertaining for a while. Eventually it gets old like every open world game but there is a ton of content and you can play most of it with just the game purchase (buy it on sale, it goes often on sale)

Crazy vehicle variety including cars, bikes, boats, planes and even helicopters to choose from. The map is vast, open and really fun to explore. Races have no cheap rubberbanding; if you have a better car than your opponents you just leave them in the dust without them magically catching up to you. Also since i'm a sucker for games where loot is a thing, i kinda like the car upgrade mechanics even if they are quite simplistic. Other than that, you have many different options of visually customizing  pretty much all of the 500+ vehicles presently available in the game. My favourite customisation feature has to be being able to share livery designs with other players or using their designs on your own vehicles. And if all these features weren't fun enough, this game is fully playable in co-op. You can play almost every event in the game with up to 3 friends and you all share the rewards, so it's fun and worthwhile. Overall this is game is great fun and I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates fun driving, big open worlds and co-op.

If you often found yourself playing GTA just to mindlessly drive around, listen to music and explore, This game is for you.

yea, it has Micro transactions in that you could by ""Crew Cred"" with real $$$ to buy cars instead of earning them with the ingame currency, so think of that what you will,    

but since i bought the game on sale at $8, and enjoyd the free mustang i started with,  i didnt mind spending ~20$ to buy the Lamborghini, Camaro, Volkswagons and Corvettes i love

If i actaully played the races and content and such, id probably earn the money to get them for free, but i just wanted a game i could mindlessly drive around the highways of a condensted USA

Map is pretty huge,    to drive from Seattle to Miami is about 97 miles to give you an idea,

So whether you wanna fly at 270mph in a Bugatti,    Cruise at 60mph in a Volkswagon bus  or any speed inbetween, This game is great for either


Also recently got a steering wheel, with Shifter and pedals, but i still dont have it set up quite right, though the game does seem to have lots of adjustable settings to work with on that

☐ You forget what reality is
☐ Beautiful
☑ Good
☐ Decent
☐ Bad
☐ Don‘t look too long at it
☐ MS-DOS
Notes: The games' scenery looks amazing, with the game taking place in a huge, free-roam, scaled down version of the USA. However, the devs had to make some sacrifices regarding the quality of some textures and effects due to the huge size of the map, some small (low quality textures and city enviroment if viewed closely) and some bigger (very noticeable changes of LOD in things like trees and traffic cars)

---{ Gameplay }---
☑ Very good
☐ Good
☐ It's just gameplay
☐ Mehh
☐ Watch paint dry instead
☐ Just don't
Notes: The game's strongest point is the huge variety of vehicle types, ranging from land, water and air, and even a mix of the first two with the Hovercrafts! [note that a vehicle of a certain type (ex. street race) can't be used in another race type from the same discipline (ex. drift) so you'll have to buy a different car for each type of event] As said before, the game features free roam and the map is huge. Next to the races it has a few little free-roam challanges like Speed Traps and Slaloms and often updated quests. The game is very arcade-y and not very realistic physics and handling-wise, but is extremely fun, and the assists can be turned off.

---{ Audio }---
☐ Eargasm
☑ Very good
☐ Good
☐ Not too bad
☐ Bad
☐ I'm now deaf
I am not a car guy, so I don't know about the autenticity of the car sounds, but I'd say they sound nice. However, this game has a weak soundtrack.

---{ Audience }---
☐ Kids
☑ Teens
☐ Adults
☐ Grandma

---{ PC Requirements }---
☐ Check if you can run paint
☐ Potato
☐ Decent
☑ Fast
☐ Rich boi
☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer
Note: Despite the sacrifices made to the graphics, the game still requires a fast PC, mostly due to the huge map size and city sizes.

---{ Difficulty }---
☐ Just press 'W'
☐ Easy
☑ Easy to learn / Hard to master
☐ Significant brain usage
☐ Difficult
☐ Dark Souls
Note: This one is a bit biased, but the late-game grinding requires you to understand how the affixes and item sets work, as I and some friends have had trouble understanding what some of these do. 

---{ Grind }---
☐ Nothing to grind
☐ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks
☐ Isn't necessary to progress
☑ Average grind level
☐ Too much grind
☐ You'll need a second life for grinding
Notes: As said previously, it gets pretty grindy late-game. After you've bought all car types and finished most races, you'll most likely start grinding the Motorpass and Live Summit (and maybe the Hobbies and Stories) and that also reguires you to grind races for parts. However, you can still play the game casually (buy and customize a bunch of cars, finish every race on every difficulty, mess around in the free-roam, take photos with the Photo Mode, etc), but I chose to talk about this since the majority of the current playerbase focuses on the grinding of the Live summit and other mentioned stuff)

---{ Story }---
☐ No Story
☑ Some lore
☐ Average
☐ Good
☐ Lovely
☐ It'll replace your life
Note: The beginning and some of the races have some story telling, and it's okay, but nothing amazing.

---{ Game Time }---
☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee
☐ Short
☐ Average
☐ Long
☑ To infinity and beyond
Note: Next to the huge variety of races and stuff to do, the game also gets updated quite often with a bunch of new content.

---{ Price }---
☐ It's free!
☐ Worth the price
☑ If it's on sale
☐ If u have some spare money left
☐ Not recommended
☐ You could also just burn your money
Note: Despite the amount of game content, I still think it's too pricey and you should get it on sale if you're planning to get the game

---{ Bugs }---
☐ Never heard of
☑ Minor bugs
☐ Can get annoying
☐ ARK: Survival Evolved
☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs
Note: I've only noticed a few minor bugs, and even then most of them don't take away from the experience.

Additional notes and things I've missed:
- The game has a similar-ish performance system to the one in Need for Speed: Payback, but way less furstrating and only really required in late-game grinding.
- The game has a character select at the start similar to that of Need for Speed: Heat, and clothing customization mid-game, with some unlockable clothing.
- The game has leaderboars for races, the Live Summit, the free-roam activities, and probably some other stuff that I don't remember.
- The game has been getting updates since its release in 2018 and has a fairly healthy playerbase

A bit of backstory - since the Inner Drive update, Street Race and Hypercar had their handling models updated to be more grippier and more intuitive to drive compared to when the game launched after an initial test run on certain cars during the Blazing Shots update. The problem is, for the next two years, this change was not applied to the other ground-based disciplines (Rallycross, Rally Raid, Touring Car, Alpha GP), meaning all cars in those disciplines that released prior to Blazing Shots and Inner Drive were on the older, outdated handling model while cars that released during and after those updates were on the newer handling model, leading to inconsistent handling and a heavy imbalance of performance in said disciplines.

Now as of Season 6, IT is gradually working on righting this wrong, starting with a full rebalance of Rallycross, followed by a current test run with Touring Car. I still think this change should've occurred during Season 3, when these disciplines were the main focus content-wise, but I suppose it's better late than never at all.",1608726030,1657453043,True,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Physics engine is wonky and cars dont handle like you'd expect. it doesn't feel like a fun arcade racer or a fun simulator, it just feels gross and floaty. Gearboxes dont behave the way you'd expect in auto or manual mode. A one-ton truck feels the same as a mustang, it's just pathetically bad. 

It looks like crap. It looks like something from the early PS3 era. Customization is laughable when you cant even remove stock liveries from vehicles. The RPG style upgrading of cars is also complete trash. 

The controller support is bad. It does not support a native xbox one controller wirelessly at all. 

Microtransactions are another thing it has, avoid it, dont give them your money it's not worth it. 

This entire game is just complete and total garbage barely worth 3 bucks let alone the 60 or more it sold for previously.  Do not recommend, infact I would avoid. Go spend your money on Assetto Corsa, BeamNG, Forza Motorsports, anything else other then this pile of absolute garbage. 

Oh and one last thing; I dont know who designed the Lake Tahoe region in this game, but whoever you are, you  should be absolutely ashamed of yourself.

It feels rushed, like it was put together on a time crunch.
A lot of assets and sounds are reused from previous ubisoft titles, such as Driver:SF, A much better game might i add. Probably one of the few decent games ubisoft has ever produced, but this isn't about driver:SF.
Right, back on track.

Buildings are copied and pasted, Horn sounds are taken straight from Driver:SF. For an open world game, this world feels incredibly lifeless like it was slapped together in a week.
To even think that this game was full price at some point makes me vomit. The visuals are way to poppy and ""Graphic design is my passion"" Esq, the voice acting is terrible and whereas TC1's story made complete sense, this feels like a concept game more then an official release.

Whatever you do, do NOT pay for this game.

Ingredients
150g salted butter, softened
80g light brown muscovado sugar
80g granulated sugar
2 tsp vanilla extract
1 large egg
225g plain flour
½ tsp bicarbonate of soda
¼ tsp salt
200g plain chocolate chips or chunks
Method
STEP 1
Heat the oven to 190C/fan170C/gas 5 and line two baking sheets with non-stick baking paper.

STEP 2
Put 150g softened salted butter, 80g light brown muscovado sugar and 80g granulated sugar into a bowl and beat until creamy.

STEP 3
Beat in 2 tsp vanilla extract and 1 large egg.

STEP 4
Sift 225g plain flour, ½ tsp bicarbonate of soda and ¼ tsp salt into the bowl and mix it in with a wooden spoon.

STEP 5
Add 200g plain chocolate chips or chunks and stir well.

STEP 6
Use a teaspoon to make small scoops of the mixture, spacing them well apart on the baking trays. This mixture should make about 30 cookies.

STEP 7
Bake for 8–10 mins until they are light brown on the edges and still slightly soft in the centre if you press them.

STEP 8
Leave on the tray for a couple of mins to set and then lift onto a cooling rack.

RECIPE TIPS
FREEZING THE BISCUITS
If you’ve frozen the biscuits, take them out and arrange them on a lined baking sheet. Once defrosted, pop them in a medium oven 190C/170 fan/gas mark 5 and heat for 2-3 mins to crisp up. Don’t leave them too long or they’ll dry out.
STORING DOUGH
You can keep the uncooked dough in a sealed container in the fridge for up to two weeks. Simply take some out, dollop on a lined baking tray and allow to come up to room temperature for 5 mins before baking",1657335529,1657335529,True,5,0,0.518292665481567383,0,True,True,False

• It's fun to drive the vehicles.

• Uplay - Forced accounts and app download. 
• More focus on microtransactions then fixing the current game. 
• Awful story and the sidekicks are obnoxious. 
• Superstar-padding by the enviroment takes the immersion away. 
• Main goal is to gain followers on social media. (I thought it was driving the cars?)

 If you have a sim rig or even just a basic setup with a wheel you will be extremely disappointed. The force feedback literally makes no sense. You'll be taking a corner and when the rear end slightly slips out from under you the force feedback just decides to fu*k off in a direction that makes no sense. There's an insane amount of options missing that would be in any racing game whether it's an arcade racer or sim with wheel support. 

Next issue is the fact that for everyone on PC you are limited to 60 fps with no work around.....like...WHAT!?!? Iv'e literally never played a game on PC that limited my frames to that of a console. What was the thought process behind this decision? 

Interface controls moving around the map with a wheel is extremely frustrating but you can get used to it

I have to scroll through every single wheel till I find the ones I want as there are no filter options unless I missed something but come on guys 

On the vehicle selection screen there's these flashy light things grazing across the car tabs and is super annoying / makes it hard to see what you're looking at

Some of the cars wheels maximum size still are too small and makes the tires look like they should be on a rally car

Just because we have a sim rig doesn't mean we are limited to sim racers. Sometimes we just want to screw around in an open world environment and zone out which Horizon is great for but that's literally all we have and every NFS title with wheel support is probably even worse than this

In the end if your game is going to have wheel support why even bother having it in the game if you're not gonna do it right?

You have street races, off-road races, Motocross, boat races, hovercraft events, and airplane races and stunt competitions. 

There are also ""story"" events, where you cruise from one town to the next, uncovering clues about a character's life. The clues lead up to the discovery of some unique car: a lowered, tricked Road Runner or a rare, vintage Porsche... and so on. 

I think I've spent more time in this game just driving around than actually engaging in the race events, and I'm still having fun.

- FOMO out the ass with the live summits, and their cars remaining in the shops just to show you that you can't get them anymore, you fucking loser
- Map wide as an ocean, deep as a puddle
- All the vehicles feel the exact same, not that you have any reason to use anything that isn't a car to begin with
- Event rewards so low you could go through Ferrari's entire convoluted process for buying one of their newer models and still have wasted less time and money than it takes to buy a mid-range car in this game
- Draconian Battlepass system that requires you to play the game religiously and has all but, what, [b]three[/b] significant rewards (as opposed to pathetic amounts of money) locked behind a paywall?
- Motorflix was honestly just a shit idea in general. We're six seasons in and they have managed to have exactly ONE good idea (Stories, which they managed to miserably fuck up anyway and there is only one story that's any fun at all)
- Obtrusive activity UI that takes up the entire screen for a good five seconds if you dare to hit a speedtrap while trying to get somewhere
- Obnoxious sidekick who will chime in at random times to make asinine remarks that aren't even correct (""Why haven't you tried Street Racing yet?"" is a stupid question to ask when I'm currently driving the car you get as a reward for completing the **** Street Racing storyline!)
- There is precisely nothing good about this game, its only pro (and the only reason I still play it at all) is that you can't buy the much better Test Drive Unlimited games (anymore in the case of the first two games, yet in Solar Crown's).

I will admit that things like, character animations, character models (cutscenes), floating trees and voice overs ruins the experience a little bit. The character animations look very unrealistic. When roaming around, you'll often find floating trees. Character models in cutscenes look rushed, and the voice overs don't really fit in to the animation of a character. For example: A character could be yelling, but the mouth would only slightly move, as well as the animation.

Overall, a very good game. I recommend it if you like racing games, and exploration games. 9/10.",1656693090,1656693090,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First, why am I stuck to one character forever? this is the most ridiculous  decision I have ever seen in a game. What game does not let you start over, or start with a new character. I dont care if it has no bearing on the gameplay. What if I have other people in my family that want to play.(which is actually a reality) So they have to play with my character? It is real dumb.

However, the number of disciplines is also a huge problem. Each one is only developed to the bare minimum. Detailing makes it clear that the game is capable of more, but instead they focused on live service content updates rather than upgrading the base game. If you want variety and arcade racing this is for you. If you were hoping for more effort in the racing itself this isn't for you.

As an FYI if I were to place the realism/arcade of the racing with Forza Horizon as the perfect middle ground IMO this would be about halfway between arcade and the middle.

+ Weather. Actually, looks nice for this being an open world racer.

+/- Scaled USA map. The overall geography of USA is modelled across the map. Several miniaturized cities with relevant landmarks are also modelled. For the most part things look pretty good across the map. Except being a racing game the lack of curvature (both right/left and up/down) in the roads can be very unnerving. Many games way older than this one has more accurate road shapes so its really inexcusable. 
+/- Physics Model. Based on the config screens for cars this game was capable of much more detailed physics. However, none of this is properly explored within each of the disciplines. Once you've used one vehicle you've used them all (aside from just being generally better at doing things).

- Progression. You get money, unlock races, buy cars and that's it. You really aren't gaining any new experiences from unlocked content. Its just the same thing in a different car. There isn't the reward of learning the ins/outs of your vehicles and getting better that you would normally get in most racing games.",1656104598,1656460639,False,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

Except the random high CPU spikes and garbage CPU utilization.

While playing I decided to keep up my PC performance stats. Turns out the CPU would hit 100% at random times quite often. Doesn't happen with anything else I play.

There's always something new to do whether it's a vehicle you wanna grind out, boosted part set you wanna collect, or new missions from an update.

This game is a great example of ""fun playing solo, even better with friends"". There are weekly Summit events that can be played solo perfectly fine and there are TONS of events to run through individually, but if you have a friend who also plays this game the possibilities are literally endless. There are a few cases when the weekly Summit has included a speedtrap event which is much easier with a friend since you can slipstream them and get a faster speed, but other than that I don't think friends are needed for any other aspect of the game.

Drifting feels weird/wrong & I just dont enjoy how the hovercraft responds. 

The map is huge. Being able to swap between vehicles as you are driving around is cool.

For my taste in handling I need to use Advanced Tuning on every vehicle. Advanced tuning is easy, once you get the hang of it but having to always fiddle with it on every vehicle gets annoying.

Parts - Grinding for parts has gotten easier but rerolling them to the stats you want is a pain & absolute waste of resources. 

Weekly Summit - I enjoy doing these but unless you have the right completed part set & know all the shortcuts its difficult to get platinum.

Motorpass - I like the idea of unlocking rewards for doing tasks but let me earn the green CC in game. 

Headlights - why have them in the game if they dont work

Non player cars - oh my these buggers spawn when they want & for some reason I cant see them until Im right of top of them. Some drive over the middle road line, some intentionally block the road & intentionally ram.

One of my biggest gripes is not being able to see where Im going b/c of weather or night or where the road is. There is no need to change the weather & day/night cycle that many times in the NY hyper car race.

646910,116071242,76561198062848658,203,2,202,0,193,1656128705,"[h1]tl;dr: Seems to be more of a quality control lacking framework for a live service, a game where the actual game came second in development.[/h1]


This must be one of the worst first experiences I've ever had with a game cause of how many unique ways this game found to frustrate me in only 3 hours.

So, first of all, the menu and UI. Changing key binds in this game is akin to a battle against a very ""smart"" system that attempts to automatically resolve key bind conflicts. Allegedly. What it actually does is a mystery to me, but it always changed a number of unrelated key binds as well, seemingly at random. Which meant that every edit had a cascading effect throughout all the controls that you had to fix with trial and error. It took me like at least 10 minutes to change 3 binds. And it's not like the game didn't allow my config, it just made it almost impossible to get there.

Second big annoyance: How to start an event from the map. Well, you select it, drive/port to the marker and then you have a access a menu which gives you some information about said event, but to actually start it you have to drive into an adjacent building. Took me a sec to figure that out. But there was a problem. I like to play with a manual gearboxx, meaning of course, to drive forward i have to shift into first gear.
In my case the button to do so being the same button to access a menu. So, every time I ported to an event, I had to reverse out of the marker to then be able to shift up and drive into the building.
You could say that this is my fault for rebinding the ""shift up"" key, but this is the second most common layout that works on every other open world racing game that I know of.

But maybe this game isn't supposed to be played with a manual gearbox. Because every time a race starts, the HUD takes a few seconds to appear. For some unknown reason. So i guess I just have to shift blind till 3rd gear.
And can I just say, having the speedometer on the left side is very jarring. This is more of a nitpick, I'm sure you get used to it, but out of curiosity I skipped through a video comparing the gameplay of 100(!) racing games. Out of 100, only 2 had the speedo on the left. ""The Crew"" and ""The Crew 2"".

To cap off menu and UI, at one point the game remembered that I bought the gold edition and added a bunch of stuff to my invetory, wich triggered about a million progress bars and achievements to appear successively. Which would be annoying on its own, but for the first half I could not interact with the world anymore for some reason (I wanted to buy a car) so I had to just wait it out.

Oh, and I haven't been able to find the ""quit game button"" yet. Maybe the game has one, but I searched for a good while and did not find it in any menu. Only ever quit with Alt-F4 or the game crashing because I tabbed out. Oh well.

Let's get the ""story"" out of the way really quick. I would not mind a non-existent story, or even a bad one, but everything here is just weird..? Why do i find myself in a stunt event where suddenly some cringe(I don't even like that word) NPC comments every single move and also talks like I'm driving his car? ""Oh, my new paint job!"" ""Don't faint"" ""Oh, my shocks!"" - Who even are you? Could you please stop talking for 3 seconds? I think I never had a game where I had to turn down all voices to zero.

I also don't get why the some races insist on bending reality itself. Nobody needs immersion, here is a tech demo with no actual effect on the gameplay. But I'm not impressed, only confused.

Maybe a good time to talk about graphics and art style. The cars look nice. But many things are just not up to the standard of 2018. The environment is bland and lacks detail, the draw distance is noticeably low and and the cutscenes appear to have a fixed resolution. Why can I see pixels in a pre rendered cutscene? 1440p should be within reach for a game of 2018.

I don't really care for the art style, in my second race I already saw some over the top animated smoke cosmetic so I guess there is just no consistency with the realistic environment/cars but whatever, it's not really a problem just not my cup of tea. I just screams of microtransactions and you can see how the need for flashy cosmetics overrules the integrity of the visual design and that's always sad.

And lastly.. what about the driving experience itself?
I do not have a problem with arcadey driving models, but I would like my car to be predictable. This game has some sort of assist (I disabled all the official assists within the options of course) that intervenes [i]sometimes[/i] when the car is about to slide out. If I steer too hard into a corner, I would expect my car to oversteer. And it does. Good. But [i]sometimes[/i] when I transition from hard left to hard right the game limits my steering, maybe to prevent me from sliding out too hard. In a sequence of corners (aka every race all the time) this leads to my car sometimes losing the grip as expected and steering hard into the corner as planned, and sometimes barley reacting.
I don't mind arcadey assists, I mind inconsistency. And inconsistency is usually the argument against sim-racing and in favor of arcade. The goal of arcade is a simple and predictable handling. This weird assist is not a result of arcarde (or sim), it's a result of bad design. How can we have a 20 years+ of history of perfectly fine driving models and a modern game of 2018 feels so weak?

I'm sure this game has redeeming qualities like an overabundance of content and.. many other things.. maybe? But I don't feel the need to explore it further. I can already see more things ready to annoy me in other reviews here, like people complaining about progression and grind. I think I'll try to satisfy my longing for a good modern racing game elsewhere.",1653625499,1653632596,False,51,7,0.724049627780914307,9,True,False,False

If you really want to enjoy it after maxing out, try using lower tiered cars or putting more affixes towards loot find/quality. That helps keep the pack with you so that races don't get boring and you can still max out the car with gold parts to get the most from affixes.

They also added a massive amount of street races, and just about all of them are pretty well thought out, only one or two runs to get the track feel down. There are some exclusive cars due to season passes (motorpass), but none of them really top the leader boards so it's not a huge deal.

Originally I gave the game a negative review, but it's gone through a ton of updates. Some of the issues are still there like locked to 60hz refresh and the photo op/skill prompts during free roam still take up most of the screen for about 20 seconds every time you go through one.

I'd recommend this game.""  The longer answer is a little more nuanced and if you'd like to read a few ""caveats"" from someone who still enjoys the game, mostly......please proceed.

I have played this game since launch.  I owned the ""Gold Edition"" on PS4 and logged A LOT of hours there.  I then made the switch to PC and, as you can see, I've logged over 200 more hours on here.  There are a lot of positives that any number of other reviews will also bring up.  There are also a lot of negatives, many of which are not immediately apparent.  And here is where I am going to bring these up.  They weren't severe enough for me to not recommend the game, but they were important enough for me to mention.

1.  No cross-platform support or cross-play (not too concerned about cross-play though)

It's one thing to not offer this.  It's another to have very specific rewards for completing certain events and not allow people who earned those rewards to carry them over (or even allow them to use MTX to buy them back on your new platform).  Don't get me wrong, if they asked me to pay money for items I already earned; I'd tell them to get bent.  However, this business model here actively discourages people from buying the game on more than one platform.  Seems stupid.  I have numerous cars earned from PS4 Summit, but because my Uplay account is logged in to a steam version of the game instead of a PS4 version of the game......I can't use them.

2.  It's pitched as ""any vehicle, anywhere, any time""

No.  It's not.  Sure, there are plenty of events and lots of different vehicles, but the lion's share of events and vehicles fall in to ""street race"".  There are more ""street race"" events than all the other ""Street HQ"" events combined.  There are more hypercars and street race cars than any other class except for MAYBE Rally Raid and Touring Car.  I don't mind these events/vehicles, but it would be nice to get something else.  It's especially bad for Summit as most ""special vehicle rewards"" are just another street spec or hypercar spec.  The ""Xtreme Series"" (one of the more unique aspects of the game) has less than ten events and that's after they added some.

3.  It's ""grindy"".

Again, clearly I don't mind the grind, but I'd be lying if I said a large majority of my time spent wasn't re-running the same handful of events for cash and parts.  The RNG is hell sometimes and certain vehicle types just get aggravating to get parts for.  

For example.  I own full legendary part sets on every single hypercar I own.  I managed to do this in about a week simply re-running the New York hypercar event,  It nets about 300,000 bucks on Ace and yields a BUNCH of legendary parts.  The event is a long cross-country event and takes around 30 min to complete.  Simple enough.  Jump on, run it once or twice, net cash and parts.  But outside hypercars (and one or two street race events) there aren't any events like this for the other specs.  This is ESPECIALLY egregious, because they had stuff like that in the first Crew.  It would be nice if there was a better way of earning legendary sets without relying on Summit or getting to Icon 1000+ to dump a bunch of points in to buffing your loot quality and amount.  

4.  ""Vanity Parts"" and ""Premium Currency""

I have an issue with ""pay to customize"", especially on a game where customizing is a key component to that experience.  It's one thing to pay $5 to have a gold gimp suit or some such crap on Battlefield or CoD.  It's another to have these ""pay parts"" on a game all about customizing.  It's made worse by the ""Season Passes"" having a ""regular"" and a ""premium"" version and even the premium pass doesn't net you enough Crew Credits to buy an epic vanity part.  You get a couple extra vehicles (probably another street spec or hypercar).

I mostly bring this up because they used to gift Crew Credits a bunch more and just by saving up a bit, you could put them to use in amazing ways and made you WANT to play.

5.  The ""Online"" Experience.

It's not great.  It's better than a lot I've seen, but it's still pretty bad.  I've had invites from all kinds of people,  almost none that actually want to do events.  You join someone's crew, you screw around on the map until someone gets bored.  Someone joins YOUR crew, they quit as soon as they realize you're starting an event.  Maybe it's time.  Maybe it's the platform.  I can't say for sure.  I CAN say, the social experience WAS better when I was on PS4.

Last but not least, this isn't Forza.  If you're expecting Forza, then buy Forza.  This is more akin to the GOOD Need for Speeds from back in the day (i.e. Most Wanted, Carbon, Underground).  The physics aren't great, but they aren't horrible.  It's mostly just designed to goof off with and have a good time......not recreating what driving a Bugatti is like.

If nothing I said dissuaded you, then give it a try.....and if you see me around, shoot me an invite.  Just don't be afraid of doing something.",1653424353,1653424353,True,39,1,0.811758339405059814,3,True,False,False

They introduced this thing called ""motorpass"" which is basically events that you play to earn loot. These missions are used to level you up and get unique items like tire smoke, decals, and even cars. The motorpass costs real money and changes often enough to not be worth it.

They try to jump around this by technically making it possible to buy motorpasses with the special currency you earn in game, but the motorpass changes every couple months and it's IMPOSSIBLE to save enough money to get the motorpass free without making this game your life.

Finally, the biggest stab in the heart, is the devs said this game would forever be ""free to earn"" and the season pass (not the motorpass mind you) would only grant you access to cars as they release and got a special 20% off any item in game. They found a way to work around this completely by making certain cars free but require the paid for motorpass to acquire.

Tl;dr: Abandoned ""free"" dlc gimmick and made owning the season pass practically worthless throughout update's. Do not recommend investing time in this game in it's current state.",1545245760,1653342617,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The Crew 2 is a huge racing game, the best on the market for arcade racing fun (with a bit of realism here and there) and exploration lovers, with a little rpg soul when it comes to vehicles powerups and leveling.
An underrated masterpiece that deserves more love.
I will explain why.

There are hundreds of vehicles in many categories.

--Street cars and bikes, Hyper cars, Drag cars, Drift cars for the Street racing, a ""family"" of races based on the pure asphalt you can find around the cities of USA, with the most varied race experience in this game.
This is also the category with the largest amount of bodykits and parts, and i'm not talking about vanity items like neon wheels and coloured smoke or NOS, just body parts.

--GT cars and bikes, F1 cars, Powerboats and performance Airplanes for the ""professional"" category, mostly track races with boats and plane races that are really funny and usually placed in great sceneries.

--In the off-road section you can find Rally cross vehicles, Hovercrafts, Motocross bikes and Rally raid (enduro) vehicles, really funny and you can figure out why by yourself ;) p.s. use hovercrafts only in freeroam.

--Then you have the ""non-pro"" Freestyle category with Monster trucks, Demolition Derby cars, stunt planes and Jetsprint boats, i just play some monster truck and demolition events, cause i find plane stunt events and jetsprint a pain in the ar se.

Every of the mentioned categories have a lot of races and stunt challenges, but this game seems more focused on the road racing, due to the amount of vehicles and events in this section. AND THIS IS A SHAME, sadly.
JUST ADD A SIMPLE RACE EDITOR, like the one in the first Crew game, dear developers.

The personalization is really good, every single car in the Street racing category has at least 50 different body pieces, combined.
When it comes for vanity items (neon wheels, rainbow smoke and animated glass tints for example) you need the premium ingame currency.

The ""POWERUPS"" i mentioned at the beginning are basically car parts that you put in slots like brakes, suspensions and wheels.
You get them after every race or event, with the rarity depending on the difficulty level.
Those will give advantages to the player like more powerful or durable boost, better aerodynamic trail, better handling on offroad, more money or followers and a lot more, based also on the vehicle type.
Then there are some special sets of ""golden"" parts that gives a special bonus when you equip them togheter, like double boost, double followers etc.
Besides those ""arcadish"" effects these parts will not give any power, handling or speed advantage to your vehicle.

When you level up your followers-level (after becoming an icon, aka level 100) you'll get some points that will increase the same stats given by the above mentioned powerups.

Every week there is a ""pack"" of races called Summit that mixes some of the categories with some twists, like stunt races, themed races with cool effets etc.
Every summit gives some limited items to players who can place high in the leaderboard, like special car powerups/parts, fancy vanity items like colourful neons, smoke or wheels or even themed vehicles.
It's meant for player that have already completed the single player campaign with a bit of virtual money in the wallet to get the new vehicles needed to complete the races and challenges of the summit.
Those vehicles are always bundled and discounted, so you will get a bunch of cool vehicles at bargain prices.

The driving experience is arcade with some realistic ""twists"" here and there. Funny nonetheless.
There are many different handling types in every single vehicle of every of the above mentioned categories.
And... EVERY VEHICLE HAS A TURBO BOOST, AKA NOS, called Pro-tox in this game. :D

The map is HUGE AND FULLY EXPLORABLE by air , ground or water.
A simplified version of the united states of murica, with the main cities, roads , monuments and nature beauties.
Lately i'm having a lot of fun roaming around in first person with motocross in the mountain forests , and with airplane between skyscrapers, really cool.
Actually the interiors and the first person in general are very well made, with the camera that will lean in the steering direction in a realistic way...so first person is well suitable for racing too.
Also the sound effects shine in first person. You will hear the wind whistling the faster you go, the wheels and the engine sounds (very well made, top notch) will do the rest.
THE MUSIC is also top notch, with various and radio stations based on your music tastes. Very good track selection and a lot of hours of different songs.

Graphically talking I find this game really beautiful an particular.
And i played FH4 maxed out....but it feels worst in some aspects compared to the Crew 2.
The climates are better in the Crew 2, without any doubt.
A lot of transitions and diverse weathers that can change in a matter of minutes with a lot of nice lightings, shaders on cars and diverse terrain effects.
Car models are really well made and the interiors are top notch.
The terrain and the world in general is very detailed considering it's a racing game.
The world destructability and the physics are ok.
The draw distance is ok, but really shi tty when it comes to traffic vehicles. I think developers made this choice on purpose for console optimization reasons.
This game lacks only in some ultra modern lighting effects but you will not notice cause lighting it's still very well done.
I play with an Xbox one controller and it's great, also funny and not too difficult with my DFGT wheel, but since i do a lot of different race categories....i found myself driving a bike or a plane with a damn wheel :D

The multiplayer can be due the lack of players in other racing/vehicle categories besides street racing.
So grab some friends add them to your crew and solve the problem, you'll have a lot of fun drifting on mountains or racing around :D

IF YOU LIKE ARCADE RACING GAMES BUY IT ON SALE, MANDATORY.
Even without cops (there is actually a cop in this game, but is YOU ;D) , it's at least 150 times better than every modern NFS, and the world map, the exploration factor, the weather system and the fun in general outshines FH4 and his copypaste FH5.",1616294500,1651958780,True,4,0,0.513888895511627197,0,True,False,False

1. The map is huge!! ( About 180+ km from New York to San Francisco )

2. At the time I'm writing this review there's more than 493 vehicles!

3. The customization is amazing! But only on some vehicles cuz some of them can't be customized or have 
    very little customization for example Rally Raid or LIVE Summit vehicles.

4. And when I mentioned LIVE Summit vehicles I'll have to talk about The LIVE Summit Events:

    LIVE Summit is a Player vs. Environment (PvE) gaming mode.
    Players who participate in the LIVE Summit have a chance of winning different tiered prizes depending on 
    their positions on the leaderboard ( Unranked, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum ) which is separate for each 
    platform (PC/PS4/Xbox One/Stadia).
    LIVE Summit's last for a week and are updated every Wednesday.
    The prizes there are for free but if you miss them and still want to get them you'll have to pay IRL 
    money for them... ( Not vehicles, vehicles just become rare after time cuz there's no way you can get 
    them ). So there's the motivation to play The LIVE Summit Events!

5. You can do everything in this game from Hypercar Races and Drifting to Air Race's or Power Boat Race's.

6. The Photo Mode is amazing! Lot's of filters and alot of customization with the camera. 👍

                                             ❗️❗️❗️    BUT TC2 ALSO HAS SOME BIG L's!!!    ❗️❗️❗️

1. Don't but it at full price! ( I think you will regret it... Cuz the Original price is: 49,99€ and the Sale price is: 
    12,99€ or 9,99€ )

2. The physics are weird ( Ik It's an arcade game but.... Do they have to be that bad? )

3. The story is the type of a classic racing game, from nothing to everything + the characters are very 
    forgettable except the black dude on a wheelchair ( Still don't know the name )

4. Pedestrians look like they are from a PS1 game.

5. In place's like New York there are literally no NPC's. But on some lonely road going to the forest? Guess 
    what?! THERE'S LIKE 150 VOLKSWAGEN SUV'S GOING 20 km/h AND A FUVCKING DEER AND A COW 
    GOING TOWARDS YOU!

6. The big city's look amazing but when you go to some village or something, the house's look like picture's 
    from 1989.

                                                                But I still play it and love it :) ❤️️",1651864253,1651864841,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Really fun to play, after a bit of tuning and removing of the assisst systems the cars become much more responsive.
The assist one can turn off right away, to tune everything on the car one have to wait until one reaches the first Icon level (there aree 9900 Icon levels), one can get there relatively quickly so isn't much of a hassle.
Works quite well without having to tune the veichles as well and just go with the default, the only thing I strongly recommend is to turn off the assists, as they make controlling the car feel unnatural and for me anyway harder. Everycar can be indvidually tuned, but the assists that is found in the same place as the tuning and is the top category of it is goes for each type of veichle, so if you turn it off for one Street Race car you turn it off for all those, same with hyper cars,hover crafts, race planes, power boats, and so on. There is a line seperating the assists from the normal tuning, the normal tuning is done individually for each different veichle and is not done for all veichles of that category, different veichles also respond different to the same tunings, so that is a good thing. Or one can just go with the default tuning, that one is pretty ok to.

In the first Crew game you where working undercover, pretty much like many of the Need for Speed games, in this one you are a driver making a career, much more like the Forza Horizon Games.

There are tons of different activities to do, everything from classical racing, to Demolition Derby, Monster Trucks, Slalom with different kind of veichles, Air racing and acrobatics, Escapes, Photo Shots, Skills, Events, Exploring, Collecting, Stories, Upgrading with better parts, customizing the looks of both the veichles and your character, as well as designing ones own custimzed looks like in Forza, and customize the chassises on cars, the Street cars are the most customizable ones (There are several different categories of Veichles) and more.  Both PvP, Solo play activities, and Group (Crews), coop play PvE or PvP, depending on what one prefers.

Really loving it and is really hard to put away, although one can buy Crew Credits (Special in-game money aside from the usuall Bucks that is the normal in-game money) there is not really much need as it is not that hard to earn cash. And most things can be bought with normal cash or won through activities and events, there are somethings that can only be bought with Crew credits, but as far as I have seen those are just cosmetic stuff.

The control setup for planes and boats are pretty easy to use as well, not very complicated :).
one can also choose between several different cameras, 2 3rd person cameras, a hood, camera, a bumper camera, and a cocpit camera for all types off veichles, on cars one can also customize how the inside of the cars look. And different cars will look different offcourse depending on what car it is and their make.

There are also both modern and classical veichles.

If you like the Forza Horizon games, then you are probalbly going to enjoy this one as well.
And if you did not think Forza had enough to do, then this one have even more activities to do :D.",1651021077,1651021077,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
