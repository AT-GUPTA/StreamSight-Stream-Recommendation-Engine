*************************************************************************
Slightly above casual flight game.

Pros:
Graphics. If you have the processing power and stable internet for the streamed scenery, it's beautiful.
If you lack either of those things, you're going to have a bad time.
I did not personally have an issue in the graphics department, but your system may vary.

Control(s) binding.
Overall a great system for having modifier keys/buttons to perform different tasks with a limited/restricted number of controls.
Only gripe is the controls menu that sometimes seems to get mad at you for not specifying a class/type/group and resets the controls menu to everything at once.

Cons:
The flight models are insanely underwhelming. This has very reminiscent feeling of Flight Simulator X and it's predecessors, where external/additional software was necessary to give you more realistic physics.

The updates. Holy hell the updates initially where for some reason the Xbox style distribution was the choice was awful. I've noticed lately they're more reasonable, but when using a platform like Steam, the launcher for the game counts as playtime, so you may have several hours ""played"" while it was all just updates is a hard pass.

Support. I'm guessing Microsoft is doing business as usual treating games as a service, so now that FS24 is on it's way, I can only imagine ""DLC"" to upgrade your game to the newer version, instead of I don't know, ADDING CONTENT TO YOUR OVERHYPED GAME.

Overall:

5/10, not worth buying unless it's 75% off original pricing. Even then it's still a hard sale considering the price of additional content from third parties (this used to be a problem in the days of FS9, FSX, but you could buy a cheap copy of the game from virtually anywhere.)

The gameplay is definitively very nice, especially if you like planes like me, which this flight simulator has an expansive collection of. I personally thing that it`s quite nice to just [b]f l y .[/b] Also, there is tons of different missions, including discovery flights to take in the stunning graphics (we`ll talk about those later), various training missions to better understand the art of flying, and more. Perfect when you`re bored. You can also fly [b]literally anywhere[/b]. yes, anywhere from international hubs like New York to your own house without downloading anything, which is sensational. Though, there is a sizable catch: Some propeller planes, including the Cessna 152 and 172, Cirrus SR22 and more, like to just fail on me mid-flight, even with all assists, of which there are many. After the failiure, instruments suggest that the oil pressure is straight up gone, and I can`t get it back (probably because I`m not a real pilot.) And the Cessna 152, which is included in this list, is used in many flight trining missions, making them impossible.

Graphics: 10/10
The graphics here are an easy 10/10. They are just stunning, though they do sometimes fall short. For example, nuclear power plants get represented as round skyscrapers, which is quite funny. Ignoring that, the graphics are just beautiful and gefinitely fit for a triple-A title.

Download:0/10
The download process was absolutely miserable, chugging at 2 Mb/s on roughly 300 Mb/s internet. I started the download at roughly 2-3 PM and still had to do it overnight. Absolutely unacceptable.

Overall: 8.5/10
This is definitely a solid game, and it deserves its position as the best flight simulator. It`s quite expensive, but worth it.",1708887232,1708887232,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Both in it's original form and as FSX:steam. I waited a while for this one to settle in and become established. I wasn't going to bother and stick with FSX and XPlane 11 (due to my clunky old cpu)
I downloaded MSFS 2020 on a bit of a whim (whilst on sale) as my computer is getting a bit long in the tooth ( 7 years old i5 with a GTX 970 graphics card and 16 gig of RAM). It JUST scrapes in on the minimum specs with a tiny bit to spare.
Disappointed? Flying a slide show? Hell no. I laugh to myself at the vast improvement over fsx. I can take off and actually recognise the area where I am flying without massive upgrades. i.e. I love Lanzarote, Tonight I took off from Lanzarote airport VFR and could easily navigate along the coastline of Puerto del Carmen and see the landmarks I know. This is with a vanilla, nothing added, install of FS 2020. it runs smoothly and I have not yet experienced any stutters or hangs 
Is it perfect? hell no ( I'm on the minimums almost, after all) Am i glad I took the punt at the sim? YES.
I have caveats: 
I have limited time in the sim and I have yet to try any of the big iron and yet to fly any of the dense environs, but so far so good.
Do I recommend to anyone in a similar position? YES you won't be disappointed. I love it so far

Cons:
This game is nonrefundable because the download is done through the actual game which absolutely sucks and just slows down the download speed. Other than that, the game is mostly pay to win in my opinion, you have to buy planes and liveries, etc. so I wouldn't recommend it when it comes to the selection of planes and liveries unless you buy a deluxe or premium deluxe pack.

Pros:
The game is fully interactive, as well as you are able to set settings for which you can choose from realistic, simple and assisted. This game is really fun and time consuming, especially when playing on VATSIM where you can interact with real people in real time! Absolutely amazing. The views, wohhh!!! Can't describe how amazing they are! I would recommend it for the enjoyment, not for the selection of planes and liveries though.

Unable to play, crashes on startup

Update: Finally managed to launch it, most of the playtime was spent downloading the game data of 100+ GB (!) which has to be done in-game and counts as time played.
This has to be a joke, physics and plane controls just feel horrible, a plane in Just Cause flies better... Don't even think about flying with only a keyboard. Loading times are incredibly high and if you crash the plane, the game reloads EVERYTHING from scratch.
Graphics look mediocre even on ultra and 4K.

Say what you will about Microsoft's tactics, I don't believe their intent is to game the steam refund system- still, the result is the same, and they should catch flak for that. There are plenty of reviews that talk about that issue. As it stands, you literally cannot refund this game.

So, down to brass tacks. This is a flight simulation. Think ""Train Simulator"" but for uh... you know, plane ""enthusiasts"". You know the type. I'm their target audience. There are assists available for those inclined to explore interesting places, there's realistic settings for those inclined to get weird about flying planes and helicopters. There are... a *lot* of realistic settings, buttons, etc. Think of something, good odds it's possible to tweak it.

The game is stunning in most ways, and the fact that there are microtransactions doesn't bother me if the return is the level of quality displayed in the game. It's great how far flight sims have come since I was a kid. There are a few gripes that are solved with free mods, like tree height, or certain locations looking odd. Four years out, flightsim.to probably has a good enough answer.

You probably already know if you want this, and if you already know you want it, you're probably right. If you're not sure, plumb the depths of your mind and think: ""Do I like the sound of the seatbelt light a little too much""",1708586422,1708586422,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

More or less if you liked FSX you would like this. World is amazing to look at. Planes are impressive. Have a good enough computer to run it.

Downsides...
No accurate Crash physics...Game just stops and asks if you want to restart. Play something else if your goal is to smash planes together. Insane amount of Hard Drive space needed. Needs good computer to run ok. Also if game is choppy, the computer needs to reset, When I try to fly every plane in a day the cashes get full up, A reset of computer will restore performance. Also just because it is on the market place doesn't mean it is good, read reviews also any planes with weapons, bombs or missiles will not come with those visual options. To maintain a E rating they can not sell anything that has weapons, it is not a combat sim and even though you can get 3rd party planes with weapons they are visual and do not work. 
Upsides
Accurate ground textures I was even able to find my real life car...it was only drawn on the ground but from 4000' it looks good. Some areas they are LIDAR Data so you can see actual 3d cars and building faces, when it works it is scary how real it is.

My issue was after 55gb installed the game crashed & removed the ssd from my computer altogether.
After fixing the sdd i went back to resume the download to find i had to re-install the game from the start.

If my experiences off this game was actual gamplay & not just installing of game files I wouldn't have refunded the game.

You lose the right to refund this game the way Microsoft handles the download & install off the game files, while the game launcher runs in the background.

If in fact you do finish the install & have an issue with the game, you can't refund due to game launcher running in the background while installing the game files & yes this does count as game time on steam even tho you haven't played the game.

MSFS currently receives regular updates, which on top of bug fixes and engine improvements, includes free content in the form of regional packages that add real-world details (to the point that you can accurately go on architectural tours in huge swaths of the world), and occasional 3rd party promotions that come with cool free aircraft and challenges: Maverick, Red Bull, & Dune all offer free aircraft and challenges (the Omnithopter is a special delight to fly over your favorite city in - big glass cockpit has open views and that thing can hover on a dime, fly backwards, do insane flips - so much fun...). All of this is in addition to the included flight lessons, discovery flights, landing challenges, the Bush flights, the historic flights, and the endless additional content in the Marketplace - it's staggering how much there is to do here. Where this hobby gets expensive is in the peripherals and add-ons, but adding pedals, a throttle, and a proper joystick makes it an immersive experience. The 5800x3D/4090 combo finally unlocked the level of VR realism that I'd been searching for decades - it feels like you're in the cockpit. The range of available aircraft is another huge realm of this experience - big, small, slow, fast - there is an option for everyone, but make sure you read reviews before buying Marketplace aircraft.
Real-world weather comes with fun Easter-eggs, like you can experience a solar eclipse in real time! 
There are add-ons that enhance the feeling of a living world (boat traffic, birds, etc.) that are worth it if you have $ to burn and hard drive space available. Once you download all of the free packages and start to collect aircraft, and you build up a rolling cache, your MSFS folder on your hard drive can easily go over 1 TB on it's own, but if you're into aerial sight seeing, then this is a must for you - it's a very good 1x1 map of the ENTIRE world to fly around in, and it can be nearly as beautiful, thrilling, and exhausting as flying is in real life.

This is one of the only flight simulators where you can take a trip in an airliner across the entire 1:1 globe that uses real time weather and traffic data. The immersion is so next level that sometimes you'll catch yourself staring out of the window of your 737 at a famous landmark forgetting that you're even in a game. It doesn't have to strictly be played for fun as a game either; you can use MSFS as an actual tool for practicing your flying skills, as well as standard operating procedures that airlines use, & even ATC communications which is its whole own thing. You can either use the default ATC in game or use a 3rd party software like VATSIM for real time communication with volunteered controllers for a more realistic experience.

Edit: One thing I'm not a fan of is this game takes 30 minutes to an hour just to load up (not even counting the time it takes to set up and load a flight) Sometimes it will crash (not because of my hardware) and it's so frustrating because I don't want to wait 30 minutes to an hour to load in, hopefully they fix this with msfs2024.",1704517612,1708205262,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I had to move the motherboard SATA connection back and forth to get the drive to be recognized.  That happened 4 separate times - each after killing the installer from the task manager.

Fact is, this is clearly just a poorly written installer.  Yeah, it works for some.  But in my experience it was horrible.  And based on looking for answers on the web, I'm not the only one.

[h2]TL;DR:[/h2]
- 12 hours to download the 120 GB (on a ~120 MB/s line, running at a whopping 0.3 MB/s - sometimes 10MB/s but it never lasts), I don't know how many more hours to download all the free stuff available.
- I wish it was a microsoft game, they have decent servers. Oh wait...
- there's a menu to show the controls. Of course it's ordered very poorly, with shortcuts that don't make sense.

It says 17 hours play time at the time of this review. Don't be fooled, I've tried for the lasT 20 minutes to fly over my house, without success. And that is my entire actual ""play"" time.
The planes/helicopter behave weirdly, tiny tap on the controls, nothing happens, 2 tiny taps and they go into a spiral.
The mission planner or whatever its called doesn't like being told the altitude (good luck finding how to set it btw!).
That or maybe 500 ft is not acceptable so you end up at 5000 ft. So of course, you try and plan a slightly different mission. Guess what: it doesn't remember what you've just set, you can set it all up again. Whoever designed that: ugh.

As many other people on the net, I have super low download rates: 2 Mb/s, so around 300 kB/s (I'm feeling generous).
However, in the another steam-like downloader, I usually get around 1 Tb/s, which is around 100MB/s (yes, 500x faster).
It's not my computer, it's not my wifi, it's not my ethernet, it's not my DNS set to google or whatever, it's not my netsh config. I didn't try the VPN trick so it could be my provider but really, I don't think so.

Hell, at this download rate, I think they are pulling a prank.

It's been going on for years now so it will not be fixed.
Unfortunately for me, I have a special link to this game so I'm willing to endure this non sense.

[spoiler][b]Don't be like me.[/b][/spoiler]

Final word: after 22 hours of computer ON because slow downloads, I finally finished downloading 350 GB of game + free stuff. That's about 4 MB/s if I'm not mistaken. This is great - NOT.

[hr][/hr]

[h1]Old review from a few years back: 2020, 2021?[/h1]

Be aware that you'll be downloading 500 MB (0.5 GB) through steam and an additional 110 GB through the in game downloader. This counts as play time.
I'm new to FS so I set it on easy, where you get a help that tells you what to do.
I selected mouse & keyboard to play.
I'm on the runway, about to take off, great. If I remember well, I chose the TBM plane.
Press Y for the outside/cockpit view.
Press B to release the brakes - doesn't work, I see that the handle didn't move in the virtual cockpit.
Then, the game tells me to press the ""THROTTLE_INCREASE"" key, without further information.
F3 after some research.
I'm starting to move, cool. I try to use the arrow keys to get the plane to move, nothing.
I press Y to get the outside view and the plane immediately stops from moving ???
I don't have time to painfully look the dozens (hundreds) of keys through the configuration UI.
Apparently, there's no official manual with all the keys either, I could only find some lists of keys of various reviewing websites.
Unfortunately, i didn't have enough space on my SSD to install it there so it was just a regular HDD.
Awful loading times.
I've asked for a refund since this wasn't a fun experience at all.",1600515338,1708146058,False,2,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

The update system is [i]infuriating[/i] and should be prohibited by Valve - essentially only the MSFS launcher is updated within Steam, all physics/general updates are done during launch, and then all scenery and world updates are done within the game. Conceivably, one could launch Steam, find a ~300 MB update for the MSFS launcher, load MSFS to find a 50 GB game update, then finally get to the menus to find 30 GB of world updates. I've clocked up tens of hours of Steam playtime just with the game sat running internal updates.  

It is a behemoth, hundreds of gigabytes with all the add-ons. It is clunky, confusing menus, slow to load and absolutely full of bugs and issues. I've completed challenges where bugs prevent them being recognised, I can't see some friends online but see duplicates of others, and so on, and so on. 

However, it is unbelievably beautiful. For ~¬£20 I would recommend just for the wow factor, flying around areas one knows in incredible detail. The regions with photogrammetry are mind blowing. As a fun game, it's also good, some fun challenges, not withstanding aforementioned bugs. It's certainly not worth it's full price (still ¬£60 as I write this review in Feb 2024).

If you are a serious simmer, and want something that loads in seconds, is physics based, has functional menus, detailed aircraft systems, and you can forgo the beautiful scenery (or afford orbx) - then X-Plane is the better choice.",1707679804,1707688974,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

For the most part it is a really fun simulator but the file sizes are pretty insane. If you have a beefy rig it will be graphically beautiful and I recommend an eye and head tracker. There isn't enough quality control in the marketplace so it feels like you have to research all of the dlc you might purchase. 

And I have noticed with the Steam version there is a bug that won't sign you into the X Box network, which makes the game unplayable at times and you end up having to uninstall, usually for a couple of weeks before they fix the bug, then re install. .

Asobo and MS have announced and plan on releasing a sequel to this sim, MSFS 2024. The 10 year update promise has been disregarded, ostensibly to address design flaws in the MSFS 2020 engine. If they address those key issues, like the launcher and its awful, slow download and installation process, then maybe MSFS 2024 will be an excellent sim. That said, MSFS 2020 will still have those major flaws. As it is currently, I typically reach for XP12 and DCS before MSFS 2020 because they have better flight models and I don't have to spend more time downloading updates than playing. Sure, they look worse but at least I can get flying. 

Original Review:
The best looking flight simulator on the market. The flight models vary from cartoonish to study level. Some of the aftermarket aircraft available have finally reached study level which is nice. There are some bugs which were present during the insider testing which have never been removed, such as the auto-pilot deciding to roll left and enter a suicide dive. This can happen in any aircraft, in any configuration, which is extremely annoying. Spend 10 minutes inputting a flight plan to the FMS just to have the AP try to kill you as soon as it's activated.",1664062259,1707685959,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As much as I want to like it, I can't help but experience a degree of buyer's remorse every time I open the game. My 152 hours played do not represent my actual in-game time. My views are built on a cumulative 500+ hours in previous MSFS entries.

[h3] tl;dr [/h3]
MSFS2020 is no more than a visually-appealing game masquerading as a proper simulator. The game's mandatory update policy and menu design are what I would describe as anti-consumer. The game is missing many tools that have been available since FS2002 (that I have observed). Avoid this product unless you need a shiny couch game.

[h3] The Good [/h3]
The game does deserve praise for it's visuals. An accurate world map being streamed to your session is an impressive technological feat, and it pays off in the flight experience. VFR flying is pleasant when you can identify real-world landmarks that you drive by every day in the real world. 

Flight physics feels... a little better(?) Than FSX. The juxtapose being I can pull the stick back on any given plane at stall speed and it will almost certainly hang at the edge of it's flight envelope indefinitely. I'm unsure how stalls are simulated with that said. This comment floats between the Good and Bad sections. Yes, my physics setting is set to realistic.

The flight plan map features a scrollable Earth to move around and select your dep/dest airports. If the map hadn't stopped being blank at high zoom in the past few months, this comment would be in the Bad section. Regardless, I'd call this feature an upgrade to previous entries' use of a panel with multiple dropdown boxes. Though it would be nice to have the filter options available here as well.

Airports don't look like copy/pasted tiles, as compared to previous MSFS entries.

G1000 is all-round great. Could use a Tetris button for those long-haul flights.

[h3] The Bad [/h3]

Edit- I've discovered that zooming in on the flight planning map too quickly crashes the game.

Edit- I've started dabbling with custom livery creation and am not surprised in the slightest with how inconvenient every step of the process is. The official SDK does not provide any useful information about livery creation, so I'm left to piece together information from various online sources. While confirming this statement on the SDK website, I found that the ""How To Create An Aircraft"" link 404s. I've nonetheless managed to create a custom livery despite the massive setbacks. The fruit of my labor appears to be somewhat spoiled, as my game now has random crashing fits while loading into the world or looking around too quickly. I can only deduce that this is related to the custom liveries but the behavior in which the crashing manifests itself leads me to believe otherwise.

Edit Edit- The game is now crashing before reaching the main menu even in Safe Mode. I suspect that I am being punished for this review.

Administration-wise, I'm not upset about the recent server issues causing a mandatory update to be unobtainable for a few hours. Downtime happens. What I'm upset about is players being unable to use their purchased software when an update is available. Leading to my first point:

Mandatory updates. For the love of god let me play the game that I purchased. Why is this patching not performed through Steam, like every other rational game? I allocate an amount of personal time to play your game, only to endure updates of 10+ minutes if I'm lucky. I've experienced a crash to desktop while in-game, and it then asks me to update when re-opening it. A customer should have the right to update their software when THEY see fit.

I'm pretty sure your flight information doesn't get logged if you're not signed into a Microsoft account. This is unlike previous MSFS entries where the sim itself maintains a logbook detailing every flight.

Content Manager is very difficult to find in the menus. How else am I going to update my scenery for <European country here> and jack up my MSFS2020 install past 200GB?

Flight planning is lacking a lot of depth. In previous MSFS entries, I had an IFR map in which I could drag my flight path onto VORs, DMEs, intersections and the like to form a complex route. Absolutely not a thing anymore.

Flight controls have just never felt right in this game. I've adjusted my joystick sensitivity curves any which way, but I've never found a good feel. Can't say the same for previous MSFS entries. Those just work. I won't deny this is probably just a me issue.

Differential braking in aircraft with free-castering nosewheels such as the DA40 is non-existent. Assigning keys to the Left and Right brake controls yields no results.

The Alt-menu featured in sims of old has been replaced by a developer toolbar that must be toggled on in settings. Absolute downgrade in every regard. The ability to take 4K screenshots is hidden in this toolbar, and having it enabled means you won't earn Steam achievements on your flight. No more flight replays, timescale adjustment, teleporting, fuel quantity changing, or in-flight failures. These are a huge deal-breaker to me.

Active Pause literally does not pause. It gives the appearance of pausing your game. When enabled, your aircraft stops moving but will continue accelerating according to it's current situation. Start a flight and ascend to altitude, then nose down and pause. The airspeed will continue to increase as if the game were not paused. I've accidentally had Active Pause enabled while starting up the A320 at a gate only to find myself unable to move. After some troubleshooting, I disabled Active Pause only to be flung forward into the gate at several hundred knots. This is a huge deal for me, as I'm usually unable to both manually fly the plane and be moving around the cockpit working switches. Severely affects the playability.

In-game cameras are not pleasant to use. In order to use anything other than the switch-through cameras, you need to navigate through that abhorrent floating menu in the upper-center of the screen and navigate through another menu that appears, then through several drop-downs. I want my right-click menu back. This wouldn't be so bad if the Active Pause actually worked, so I could navigate the menus without the pressure of possibly destroying my aircraft for a photo.

Camera ""zoom"" with scroll wheel is actually just changing the camera FOV. Entirely not useful when you're trying to move your camera up to get a vantage on something of interest. This is not how it's worked in previous MSFS entries.

ATC is just more limited and soulless when compared to previous MSFS entries. I'd almost expect voice synthesis to sound a bit better than prerecorded voices when the simulator controls the context.

Ground taxiing with AI traffic is laughable. They'll roll right through you as if you weren't there. Even FS2002 didn't do this!

The Bell 407 yaw stability is non-existent. Read up on some forum posts and was never able to resolve the issue. Unusable.

When using live weather, you'll occasionally encounter ridiculous spontaneous wind shifts. Sims in the past usually had pretty hard weather shifts, obvious by sudden cloud changes, but nothing like this.

Weather panel is more limited than previous MSFS entries, and I'm not entirely convinced the layers work properly, based off previous experimentation.

Water got a downgrade compared to previous MSFS entries. Any body of water is only a few feet deep, meaning aircraft do not interact with the water itself, but the land under it. Seems a very hack way of implementing this when previous sims had relatively good water systems.

once again, I went to play the game again after a couple of years - had to endure an insanely long download, then another insanely long loading screen (with no feedback about what it's doing). I closed the game because it appeared to be doing nothing for 20+ minutes. opened it and finally reached the main menu! but then every screen was broken. I then did a very normal thing for a steam user and verified the integrity of game files, only for that to delete all of the 137gb game that I'll now have to re-download if I want to play (I don't)

steam has solved the issue of content delivery, DLC and updates, but MS just use an objectively worse system (and continue making awful UX) for no reason, apart from the fact it artificially inflates playtime which probably looks GREAT to microsoft execs!

don't buy this game - I won't be buying the next MSFS due to the continued awfulness

Since Microsoft forces Asobo to use Azure PlayFab for their CDN and often broken live services, contacting support is mostly a matter of shifting blame around.

> can use VR setup - can grab yoke, turn dials, and flip switches.
> more accurate landscape - easier to navigate by landmarks.
> has collision damage and engine stress - can fly your ride apart
> tame large aircraft physics.
> air traffic
> can fly the DC-3 included in standard line-up -- long live the legend.

Cons:
> less stable -- dependent on other auxillaries --- if one is not updated = program crash
> VR interaction is glitchy - imagine a touch and go - you're short and steep and you are irl flapping your arms up and down trying to get the flaps to step up.
> ghost collision - you are parked, doing a cold start -- suddenly collision / crash.....
> sometimes you start parked 2000 ft in the air --- pull on the yoke, see if the frame can glide from a zero velocity dead drop, and perform a cold engine start before you face plant.
> the larger craft handle well - but the smaller seem off... too tame.
> data hog -- over 80% of my current hours was downloading.

would still recommend as it has other options that brand X doesn't offer, everything on the plate is good training.

The few hours i played where great though.

Update January 2024:
As of today i moved the whole data to a seperate, old 240 GB SSD drive.
The data just used up to much of my main SSD with other games.

If you want to do the same:
You can select the data folder upon reinstallation of the ""Starter"" files you install with Steam :)
As a good practice, assign a unique drive letter to that data SSD drive before reinstalling / changing the data folder.

Estimated data used as of January 2024: 

190 GB

Update on size now i checked free in-game world updates:

240+ GB

Thanks, so my old SSD is already obsolete again :)

I love the realism and graphics, but there are a lot of crappy things in this flight simulator. If you like fighter planes like F-16s, this is the game for you. If you like airliners, your options kind of suck. 

So here is what I really hate about this game. Developers, please fix some of these stuff in MSFS 2024, otherwise it just feels like the game is throwing money into a fire. 

1. The autopilot does not work. It does, but at a certain point the autopilot won't follow instructions or the flight plan. It is really frustrating and I overshot the airport dozens of times thanks to this.

2. Have more variety when it comes to airliners. I don't know if this a MSFS or small creator problem, but the options for aircraft suck. Several airliners don't even appear in the game, and if you hate one product for a plane, you don't have any option to buy another for the type (eg 737 MAX). 

3a. While on the topic of airliners, there are only three options for a standard edition. The A310, A320NEO, and 747-8i. And the livery options are really horrible for starting off. Barely any selection.

3b. And now I have to pay MORE money for liveries. 

4. I got into a stall a couple times and the flight assistance didn't help even attempt to recover. There were even 2 times where it nosed DOWN the plane at around 5k and 8k feet and wouldn't recover, even in an overspeed.

Those are actually my only complaints. I sort of feel like a Karen for complaining about this stuff, but 1 and 3a may relate to some. Also, if you want to buy this: Don't. Just wait for MSFS 24 to come out which (hopefully) should be this year. Unless you like fighter jets.",1707006856,1707006856,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Long version: First things first, the interface is optimized solely for Xbox and is horrible to use on PC. Most interactions (inlcuding the most basic ones like looking around) require weird crtl-alt-shift-hotkey combinations, and some are even wrong out of the box (like propeller angle and mixture working in reversed order).
So your first job is to go through ALL the commands and correct them and map them to keys that are actually usable on a keyboard. If this is a console game, then why do they hype it as successor of one of the most important PC (not console!) flight simulators? Must be some neat marketing trick.

To the planes.. they look good and realistic at first glance, but most planes are equipped with the same Garmin G1000 glass cockpit, including the Beech Baron, the Beech Bonanza, and even the venerable C208B. Although it is realistic that all those planes did exist in G1000 versions in real life (not anymore though since the G1000 is discontinued in real life), it leads to all the planes looking, feeling and handling pretty much the same. And since there are no more 2D cockpits but only the 3D representation, the glass cockpit is very hard to read from the normal piloting view. That means in order to read or change something, you need to pause the game, zoom towards the controls, change what you need to change, reset the view, unpause the game. Very realistic flying indeed.

To the ground textures.. they are based on satellite images which actually looks pretty good as long as you're not flying too low. However, as soon as you start to log a few hours in the game and use different weather/season settings or even the ""real weather"" feature (which I already liked a lot back in FS2004),
you realize that there is only ONE set of textures. That means that when you use real weather and fly in winter, you still fly over lush green forests and blooming fields. And that looks so ugly and feels so unrealistic that I wish the old FS2004 graphics back, at least the scenery there would change according to the season.
It really makes this feel like some cheap flying game where they did not have the resources to implement changing scenery.

To the real issues.. boring planes can be replaced by community planes from the marketplace (there are a few good ones if you are willing to shell out the price of the game a second and third time),
and unrealistic scenery can be looked over. What cannot be replaced or looked over are the frequent crashes and the lack of some of the most basic and essential features.  Like saving and reloading a flight, which is not possible.

Because you're probably not going to believe it (I know I didn't), I'm going to say it again: yes, you cannot save and restore a flight. 
The feature does exist, but is horribly broken and seems to be broken for years already, but MS doesn't seem to care no matter how much the community complains. You may save in mid-flight, but when you load, you never know where you end up - sometimes in the air, sometimes on the ground, sometimes with engine running and sometimes not. What will be the same every time though is that your settings, autopilot and avionics configuration and flight plan are gone.
So you can forget about longer flights in larger planes.. all you can realistically do is short flights that can be completed in one sitting. And there is the cheap flying game feeling again.

And don't even think about just speeding up the sim during long flights with the sim rate feature.. that is botched as well since they didn't bother to put in a rate indicator. Happy guessing!

Don't think about just testing it either, since you can always refund.. you can't. Steam only gives you a small loader program, you then download the actual game from Microsoft. Their servers are so horribly slow that the download takes 10+ hours, which Steam conveniently counts as game time. So once you can actually
start the game, you are already way over the 2 hour refund limit. Another neat trick to prevent refunds.

So if you're ok with an Xbox flying game to take a few smaller planes for a quick spin in all-summer scenery, it's not even a bad game, albeit overpriced.
However if you want a real flight simulator, DO NOT waste your money on this one despite all the hype. You have been warned.

Boy, do I wish back the times of Flight Unlimited 3 back in the 90s.. working save feature, scenery changing according to season including moving animals (I'll never forget that moose on the runway.. ouch!), a working realistic damage model including damaged parts like a broken landing gear from a hard landing or damaged flaps from going too fast with flaps extended, and even realistic air traffic control responding according to the players actions (I'm still laughing about that tower controller yelling at me for making him spill his coffee after that daredevil close pass at the tower). THAT was a simulator.. and all that back in the 90s running smoothly on the simple computers we had back then. 
So Microsoft, what the hell have you been doing since 2004?

Microsoft Flight Simulator (MSFS) is a breathtaking testament to the advancements in gaming technology, delivering an unparalleled and immersive experience in virtual aviation. As a long-time fan of flight simulation, I find myself captivated by the sheer beauty and realism that MSFS brings to the genre.

One of the most striking features of MSFS is its jaw-dropping visual fidelity. The meticulously crafted landscapes, powered by cutting-edge satellite imagery and AI-driven technology, create an almost photorealistic environment that feels like a leap into the real world. From the sprawling cityscapes to the minutest details of terrain, every inch of the virtual world is a work of art. Weather effects are equally impressive, with dynamic weather patterns adding an extra layer of challenge and realism to each flight.

The attention to detail extends beyond the visuals to the aircraft themselves. With an extensive fleet of meticulously modeled planes, each boasting realistic physics and authentic cockpit details, MSFS offers a diverse range of flying experiences. Whether you're piloting a small Cessna or a jumbo jet, the sense of control and responsiveness is exceptional.

The world in MSFS is not just a static backdrop; it's a living, breathing ecosystem. Live traffic and real-time weather conditions further enhance the immersion, making each flight a unique and dynamic experience. The AI-generated air traffic and live multiplayer functionality add a layer of realism, turning the skies into a bustling and dynamic environment.

The user interface is intuitive and accessible, catering to both newcomers and seasoned flight simulation enthusiasts. The inclusion of in-depth tutorials ensures that even those unfamiliar with aviation can quickly grasp the basics and enjoy the experience. The various difficulty settings also allow for a customized experience, making it accessible to a wide audience.

The ongoing support and commitment from the development team are commendable. Regular updates and improvements, including the addition of new aircraft and regions, demonstrate a dedication to keeping MSFS at the forefront of the flight simulation genre. The thriving community and third-party developer support further contribute to the richness of the experience, with a plethora of mods and add-ons available to enhance and expand the simulation.

In conclusion, Microsoft Flight Simulator sets a new standard for realism and immersion in the world of flight simulation. Whether you're a seasoned pilot or someone dreaming of taking to the skies, MSFS offers an unparalleled and awe-inspiring virtual aviation experience that is nothing short of extraordinary. It's not just a game; it's a true marvel in the realm of simulation, and a must-have for anyone with a passion for aviation.",1706421197,1706421197,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have had a lot of good hours on this game since its release in 2021. The game itself, the flight experience, the graphics and landscapes are beautiful and impressively accurate, thanks to live connection to Bing maps. Free addons can correct some minor discrepancies in the landscape and the sideload addon system is nice to use.

The big problem is the installation. The blunt truth is that the Microsoft installer is broken. Steam has a perfectly good installation system for large games, but instead of using this, it hands you off to the MS installer which just doesn‚Äôt work properly, redownloading the same files repeatedly, sometimes 50 times each. Crucially this bug affects updates as well, so you might be looking at 24 hours or more to install every update. It also affects the in-game content manager.

MSFS Support purports to attribute this problem to a bad connection. They have a list of 100 things to try rather than accept the problem is with their installer. None of my other internet usage is affected by my purportedly bad connection. There is a workaround for me: the problem appears to be an incompatibility in the game with wireless internet. If I move my computer to somewhere with a wired connection available, the installer works. But this is an unreasonable workaround. My internet connection is wireless.

The download bug means when I first bought the game, it took four days to install. I recently spent another two days trying to reinstall it, before discovering the wired workaround. When I bought the game I thought this problem had to be with MS‚Äôs servers, and would be fixed in a few hours. It still hasn‚Äôt been fixed. All this time has been counted in my played hours.

The game itself has otherwise been improved since release. There‚Äôs a fantastic glider now and a nice little Icon A5 floatplane. But every mandatory update spells bad news.

I've always dreamed of flying a Cessna and this game gave me that opportunity (I like small planes). I know a lot of other people in the reviews are complaining about the download time being miles long and such, so I'd like to share my experience with that... Firstly, when I got the game, the initial download on steam is about 1 or so gigabytes. Once you get into the game it may need to load for a bit, then the game will prompt you for a required download (the game automatically checks for updates every launch), which is a mandatory update being the size of around 100 gigabytes, which is quite a lot (It's downloading the whole frickin' world to your computer, so what do you expect?). So the time it took to download was a little over 3 hours. I've been having lots of fun with the hyper-realism for a few days now and I regret nothing with my hefty purchase. It's a great game worth the fair price it gives.

 Thanks for reading. =)

 Edit: I only play on VR because the default computer controls are wonky as hell and I don't bother changing them, but that's just me. Do as you wish (still an amazing game). I would recommend at least an I9 CPU, 24 gigabytes of RAM and a good graphics card for best experience in VR.

Game has so many terrible bugs DO NOT BUY ·º±œÑ ‚Ç∑«ôœπƒ∏≈û ‚Ç≥‚Ç¥‚Ç¥
but when it works it's pretty fun

PART 1: ORIGINAL

The 18 hours I have spent on the game are actually spent downloading the damn thing. It keeps doing a chunk then resetting. I'm still trying to get help on this bug but so far none of it has worked, or the forums have been outdated. It seems that this issue has been around ever since release. Installing a f*cking game should not take this damn long. Do not buy this game.

PART 2: RANTING

After two days of downloading (most of the time spent troubleshooting), I got it to work. It works quite well and up until now I've been happy with the gameplay. THERE ARE SO MANY BUGS!!!  Most of the airports I have been to are PINK, you heard me right THE AIRPORTS ARE PINK?!?! I don't know how that's a possible error but it is shameful for a game that is so expensive and has been out for THREEE YEARS and more years before that going towards production I assume. I've played this game for about three days in total and every session has a bug or several. In the 747 when I load a saved flight, the throttle jams, the AI assistant dies, the HUD disappears (even after turning it on and off), and there isn't another soul unfortunate enough as I, to find a solution to these problems other than ending the whole flight.

Not only are there loads of bugs, the game design isn't nice either. I can't find any way to switch camera views other than pressing buttons hoping it doesn't do something unrecoverable. 

PART 3: THE TIMELINE

The thing that prompted me to write this is a long story. I was thinking ""I want to see if they made my favourite place 3D unlike Google maps. Why don't I fly there from my home city Christchurch, in my favourite plane the 747!"" And that's where the bugs start crawling. Just after pushing back from the gate, the ATC widget breaks and I can't stop the pushbakc until I re-tune it.

I brushed the first one off assuming it was just a weird scenario and it's fine. ((Note: The airport looks fine, it isn't pink)) On my way to Sydney, it was getting late in real life so I saved the game and went to bed. Next morning when I loaded up the flight (which took me quite a while to figure out due to peculiar layout), I tried adjusting the throttle and it didn't budge ""Oh silly me I forgot about autopilot"" Nope, even after turning off autothrottle it didn't move. I searched for ages online to find a solution but none worked. I really didn't want to lose my progress so I just restarted the flight hoping it would restart me where I was. While I didn't have to takeoff or anything, I was respawned AT SEA LEVEL. Rather inconvenient. If that was the only issue and it fixed my throttle problem (which it did) things would be fine. But.
Restarting the flight only presented MORE bugs, it hid the HUD, muted the ATC people (I have no idea how), and broke the autopilot completely.

After this  ÇhiœÑ Çh‚óåw I gave in and ended the flight. I set my departure to a custom location a while away from SYD, and when I added the pin, I can't change anything about it! I can't say what altitude, what heading, what speed, nothing! Anyway, restarting the flight fixed all of the immediate issues and I was happy. But then through the thick and low cloud, a Barbie styled eyesore loomed into view ""What the F%^K???"". Yep, it's Sydney. When I got within one nautical mile, the lag kicked in, and boy did it KICK. My computer can run MSFS perfectly fine with no hitches flying over a detailed city, but the short final to Sydney? Not a chance.

After touching down on the hot pink monstrosity, the lag started to ease off and I could taxi to the gate which was thankfully rather uneventful. I shut down my plane and ended the flight. Now for the next leg to Dubai! Not long after takeoff, the ATC chat stops dead, and then speeds up but without the voice, it's just sending the messages and not waiting for any would-be voiceline to end. It's just rapid fire and I can hardly keep up. Other than this, it's mainly fine.

On approach to Dubai, nothing abnormal happens. The airport is pink, and the ATC is fast and muted. It's all fine, I do a really good landing, I taxi to the gate, shut down, and that's another few more hours added to the logbook. But heading out of Dubai, something appalling happens. The entire right side of my aircraft doesn't work. It turns on fine,and it receives the orders from my throttle, but the engines don't do anything. At this point, I've had enough b ãllsh·º±œÑ and I have an itch to write an angry review. Here I am, pleasing that itch.

Looking back on my review I have no mercy for the guy who should be tasked with fixing these bugs. They shouldn't have existed in the first place. Thank you for reading this hand written review that is longer than all of my essay requirements ever, and please comment if you spot a spelling or grammatical error.

PART 5: Recent thoughts

I've been doing a bit of research on my favourite plane and it's MSFS version (ATR). I decided it's worth the cost and bought it. I also bought NZCH by NZA simulations, I got charged, though I didn't get the airport. I tried getting a refund on Steam so that I could try again, but apparently it had been modified, consumed, or something else. I didn't even get the damn thing. Regardless, I didn't get the refund, so I sent a problem report to the Devs yesterday (at the time of writing), still no response. Hopefully I get the airport I paid almost $40 for. Currently trying to fix the pink airports, might work(?).
When I get the airport I paid for, I'll be back to update my review.

PART 6: Update

I got my airport! But a major downside is that parts of it are pink so I'm currently re-installing the game and it's taken two days so far. I still don't like the devs because it could be so much easier to just let steam do the downloading but no, they wanted their own stupid downloader that has never worked normally for me. XP12 is probably better.

PART 7: What a rabbit hole
Turns out the pink/missing textures bug has been around for ever. I've done everything to try and fix it but NOTHING worked. Asobo and Microsoft should be ashamed. I know that sounds harsh but this game costs more money than any other game I own, takes up more space, took longer to download (2-3 days), uses more resources, causes more suffering (to me).

DO NOT BUY THIS WASTE OF TIME AND STORAGE

My intentions are not to be funny.

even if my review somehow hasn't swayed you, at least buy it from the Microsoft Store or the Xbox App. want to know why? ‚Ç´¬§ ·Ωó…æ  ò≈µ…¥  Ä…ô‚Ç∑‚Ç¨ƒÖ≈ó‚Çµ…ß",1701052867,1706138271,False,3,3,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False

The game uses Bing Maps and a live weather service, so when you load into an area that you want to fly, you may need to give the game (and ur pc) time to load up and get things rendered in.

But once your in game your there. Im not a pilot but i love the physic engine in game. The air is modeled really well across your planes and you get a great feel for how ur plane flys. 

If your a beginner like me, the game has a bunch of setting to help you find the balance of hardcore sim to something of a casual arcade flying game. Its a make your own adventure.  

For me, I like exploring places i dont have the cash to go see IRL or flying a 737 through the Grand Cayon with 1 engine

I‚Äôm not a MSFS or Asobo hater - I still try to enjoy the simulator - but after four years it‚Äôs unbelievably frustrating to have to constantly deal with very basic feature bugs that can ruin the flight experience.

For four years I‚Äôve run MSFS on the same laptop setup. I only ‚Äúfly‚Äù with my laptop keyboard and built-in trackpad. So I‚Äôm not even looking for a perfectly ‚Äúreal‚Äù experience. But one thing I expected was for obvious bugs to gradually be eliminated - and certainly not introduced with each update!

A couple of examples: I set up some custom keyboard cockpit camera controls, just to make the flight experience a little easier. Sometimes they work, sometimes they don‚Äôt. On some flights they work initially and then all of a sudden not at all! If varies from day to day, flight to flight, despite not having changed any of the bindings! This behavior has persisted for years! I can‚Äôt imagine MS/Asobo is unaware of the problem.

Likewise, keyboard pilot controls are inconsistent. Sometimes a single keypress causes a reasonable bank to the left or right - as it should - other times it JERKS the plane one way or the other! This behavior is totally unpredictable. It often happens early in a flight, but can occur anytime!

Even the flight planner is inconsistent - you can select a time of day, then use the map to enter waypoints, but then discover the simulator has radically changed the time of day! What?

New features and options are great. The richness of the simulator is incredible. But continuing to ‚Äúenhance‚Äù the game while ignoring basic bugs is just inconceivable. Likewise, don't expect to see negative comments on the MSFS forum - the moderators will quickly remove them, despite how legitimate the comments may be. So MSFS 2020 had a great vision, but a horrible execution.

As a virtual pilot, you're treated to an immersive experience that captures the beauty of real-world landscapes and cities.

One of the standout features is the game's use of Bing Maps and Azure AI, providing an unparalleled level of realism. The meticulously recreated aircraft, airports, and weather conditions contribute to the game's authenticity. The attention to detail is commendable, with everything from the play of sunlight on the aircraft's surfaces to the accurate representation of cities and landmarks.

This is a shame, and also a shame if you want to return it.

Update: After 31 hours, I finally got into and the update was done. Now ima play it and then review it. (Also, i downloaded it 4 times before it worked)

Last update: Its refunded, steam was so nice because they know MSFS2020 broke the rules so that was nice. The game did not even worked on my joystick, its a completly normal joystick. I stick to x-plane 11. (Still the king of flight simulation)

Hey Again: I bought it again... and I actually enjoy it this time. Well, that was an exaggeration, its playble. After tons of settings changes and mods, finally I can play ""xplane"" with good graphics. (still waiting for a proper replay mode like xp).

Good news: Flight Simulator 2020 simulates that all too well!  If you know that, and if you have a lot of time, money, and patience and you know what you're getting into already -- go for it.  But if you're just casually deciding whether to get into this -- probably you can have more fun elsewhere; this won't respect your time.

I've spent a ton on controllers (yoke, stick, throttle, pedals...), hardware upgrades to run it in VR (not to mention the VR headset)...  Over the years, from Flight Simulator '98 to this: it is a dream come true to be able to really sit in the cockpit, look around, and fly all over the world!  (I wish Force Feedback were still a thing).  The content updates have been a treat: the F/A 18 Top Gun expansion, the 40th anniversary additions (Meigs Field!), helicopters, sailplanes..!  (For the sailplanes, hopefully you like metric..)

But Flight Simulator will not make it easy for you to enjoy it.  Gigantic slow downloads that don't happen in the background.  An incredibly clumsy interface that makes it more difficult than necessary to actually do anything other than the limited discovery flights (which don't even include the scenarios it's showing you in those beautiful screenshots).  As of right now, the application crashes all the time (apparently some issue with downloading scenery or traffic).  Good news, though, saving and loading is hit-or-miss too!  (Hope you can get your flight done in one shot and that it doesn't crash on you...)

Beyond that, it's like Kerbal Space Program: some basic tutorials, but expect to spend a lot of time outside trying to learn how to do things, particularly autopilot.  If you poke around the site there are ""aircraft manuals"" -- the 787, 747, and Cessna Citation CJ4 have pretty good tutorial-type manuals.  The latter two are in the standard version -- by the way, another kick in the ... teeth ... is that the upgrade cost to premium is punishing compared to buying the premium version from the get go. I think it's like an extra $90 USD.  Sales on that are rare but do happen, but that's a big leap for a few airports and (let's face it...) the 787.  (You should also know that starting in 2023, first-party add-ons in the marketplace are 33% discounted if you have the deluxe or premium editions!)

Here I sit, years later and still just as frustrated as day one. Graphics are great, game play is great, plane selection is great. When the game runs well, it's nice! However, I have well over 500+ hours clocked by Steam in hte game, and yes some of that is updates, however I only have just over 100 hours of actual flight time as of today. You will setup up a flight and at very random times, take offs, landings, mid flight, and/or in game menus, the game will do one of several glitches but all end with a frozen game with the last flight noises still being played or being booted out of the game completely. I have had a couple sessions to where I played seamlessly for several hours but most flights end in the game freezing or shutting down. I have upgraded my PC, adjusted setting high and low, have even tried on other gaming PC's and end up having the same experience. Call Microsoft and they are helpful right up until they find out I bought it through Steam and then they go to blaming Steam. Not a believer in that as I have the same issues with my free version through my XBox game pass...IT'S THE GAME!!! FYI the console version is a nightmare and still locks up.

Fun but has problems. 
PROs
-Looks pretty
-Customization and modding support
-Very cool live data / traffic / weather options 
CONs
-Extremely demanding / power hungry. 
-Planes that should have been added into the base game are sold off as DLC from get-go. 
-A second installer has to launch and download an additional 127GB of data for the Sim to run; so half of my in-game time is actually just downloading the game. 
-A lot of larger international airports are unfinished, airport details are just painted on to the terrain. 
-Default control mappings are not great for HOTAS / common joystick configurations. 
-Game breaking bug that causes CTD during landing at random airports
-Jumping to a different point in your Flight Plan usually just results in the plane crashing, and the timescale / simspeed feature does not show an indication of how fast you are moving.",1655236038,1705763581,False,4,0,0.531629741191864014,0,True,False,False

Never again will I buy a Microsoft Flight Simulator after the this 40th Anniversary Edition. It constantly needs updates to be able to play the game.

The other reason I don't recommend this game is the price of the planes that have to paid to have a variety of planes. You used to be able to find planes on the internet for free and install them. Not no more, and the last straw for me is you have to be be logged into Xbox to play the game that you paid for and already validated.

The airplanes are very detailed and offer a fun yet challenging flight experience, the graphics are stunning and the photogrammetry tech offers highly accurate rendering of ground objects. There is something really special about flying over your house or neighborhood in-game and seeing it exactly as it is in real life. While MSFS 2020 does a lot of things right, it is not without its issues. Occasionally ATC will bug out, at very unfortunate times too. Some achievements do not unlock even after the requirements were completed, and the list of other bugs goes on.

My son got this game for Christmas in 1897 from his Dog, so we installed it on his Stone tablet and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 90 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching Porn. So i decided to make a Twitter account and get this game to see if could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Mayonnaise for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Mayonnaise since my Ketchup had died.

As a light harted person you may stop reading now!

For People who don't want to read the Rant.... in the end it took around 40 hours untill it was finally installed correctly and is willing to run .

now!!!!!

You are still reading?

ok
 
______Rant incoming______

Currently my Steam account reports about 32 hours played by the time i am writing this, infact I am in game right now on another system.
Huh why that.... you might ask?
Because the installer is sh*t, it is the most anachronistic thing ....... in the WOOOORLD as someone very famous would put it.
The trouble shooting guide for this game basicly reads something like this.
Kill all security applications on your system.
Do not intstall it where it self wants to install it...... Windows might not grant it all neccesary rights even if you are an Administrator on your own System.
Deactivate ipV6 on your system while downloading the Game.
Disable some network autonegotiation because the Gamesever might think a ddos attack is going on and will kick you out.

I thought this was all Microsoft .... why can't it just work.  

Now we come back to the 32 hours..... no 2..... yes two hours not more. Of theese two hours i was able to fly 1,5....
because a Logitech force feedback Stick is unknown to the likes of Microsoft.
After I got my head around the convoluted assigning of axes and buttons i failed to find the Force Feedback (FFB from now on) settings.
There are NO words to describe my feelings of disbelief  as i learned that there is no natvie FFB support.
WTF ?!?!?!? ...... is this a game like Warthunder or a Simulator.... i claims to be one.
You can find and buy 3rd party Plugins for FFB btw.
Ok but what happend in the first 30 hours you might ask ?!?...... the DOWNLOAD!!!!
A small summary of my Steam + MSFS experience 

1. buy the game

2. press button to install.

3. wait

4. !!!!Get forced to set up a Microsoft account!!!! see you next tuesday .... what is that for?
That actually brought me close to rage quit...... but hey Jeff, Mark, and Steam already have everything from me.... so Bill here you go as well.

5.Realize that you have essentially downloaded nothing.

6. Wait 8 hours 

7. Have the download interrupted by backgound noise from space.

8. Restart and find it now noly decompresses the files, so all must be well then...... RIGHT?????  no!

9. Download the update, come back the next morning.

10.Find out your game would start but the Pl ne s mis ng halv t e p rts ..... yes thats right neither steam nor Microsoft can determine if the download has gone according to plan.
To me i seems like it looks for the file structure and dosen't even check the file sizes, let alone a hash value.

11.open Steam hit deinstall.

12.Reinstall

13.Wonder why it only wants to Download ~70Gig instead of the initial 120Gig maybe it is replacing the broken Fliles since the first update only had ~60 gig.......

14.Learn that the Decompessing of files only uses ONE core of a AMD ryzen 9750X3D it has 16 btw. come back tomorrow.

15.Learn that your system crashed over night.(might due to broken files)

16.Start the game anyway and learn that the models are still broken.

17.Hit Deinstall again and find you basically only deleted the launcher. delete everything you can find related to this bloody piece of crap. comb through the registry.

18.Reeboot

19.Hit Install

20.While waiting another Day Let of some Steam and write this Review 

21. GET YOUR S  T togehter who ever progammed the installer! CHECKING HASH VALUES ON DOWNLOADED FILES CAN'T BE THAT HARD!!!!
Decompressing files with only single core support in 2024 is beyond me!
You get money for this for f sake.
In some cases the download is faster than decompressing, just for fun, as deconpressing was under way, I walked to my 1987 Amiga and zipped it's 1Gig system partition..... yes 4Gig hard drive support since 1986 eat this Microsoft.
And while it was doing that i played the very first Microsoft flight simulator on the pc emulator in that very Amiga, a thing called multitasking, you really should try it one day Microsoft.

Although most of this simulator/game is stunning, unfortunately the VR interactions and implementation is a bit lacking. I am use a Steam Index running Windows 11 with some USB connected Logitech Rudders. Rudders work great, flight mechanics are spot on, and the 3D scenery is super immersive, but the interactions of the controls with my hand controllers are awkward, glitchy, and sometimes requires such intentional focus just to grip something, that normal operations become complete inhibited by the struggle to do something that should be simple (like when trying to go between flaps and throttle while landing.) Unfortunately, no amount of immersive ground texturing is going to make up for poor VR implentation. part of the problem is that you have to point at everything to be able to grip it. That works for most switches I guess, but not the throttle or the yoke.  I only purchased this to use in VR in hopes it would be better than x-plane. Now I;ve logged 15.4 hours on the game and I can't return the game to Steam, even tho 14 of those logged-hours was just the game doing it's initial in-game updates after the first fresh install.",1705344363,1705344363,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Once you're finally in, you'll also find that none of the default planes are fully detailed/simulated, which is a bummer for something being touted as a ""simulator"". This is on top of a sometimes very silly AI-controlled Air Traffic Control that will sometimes have you doing really weird and unnecessary altitude changes as well as holding patterns that are a whole city away from the airport you're trying to land on; which of course ruins the immersion.

However, everything else about this game is bad.

- For a PC user, UI is a mess, dumbed down for XBox. Looking for or change control bindings, filtering airplanes and choosing one to fly - everything is a nightmare. They even have a basic controls screen which is completely blank and has 0 functionality. The interface even has a very annoying lag.
- Graphics are cartoonish, oversaturated and takes a LOT of effort to fine tune (nVidia filters, turning off irritating instrument popups etc). Even then, with a configuration well above recommended, it's just blurry, unpleasant. Vsync is turned on and yet not even working. 
- Few classic planes are available, glass cockpit are way too much. Physics are worse than XPlane, taxiing a taildragger is not different etc.
- Extendability and addons, the great strengths of both FSX and XPlane, are limited to an in-game marketplace.
- Not to speak of the initial 10 hour game client download which it takes to setup.

I used this to see the world and it was one heck of a geography/history lesson if you combine it with some mods and the Internet.  So why am I not recommending it you may ask?  Because after 3+ years it is still a work in progress and still under performs in VR and only getting worse with each and every update! Also it still has immersion breaking terrain morphing and and other strange visual anomalies that almost NONE have been addressed or fixed since the game's release!  Even the very best consumer level PC money can buy WILL NOT give you a totally smooth real-to-life flying experience in VR and that is after a $7K investment!  If you spend your pilot life at 30K feet, then there are other products out there too for less to get your pilot skill up with more real-world instruction.  Get down low and this software can get you a general idea what the world looks like but it's still a long way from realism.  Case in-point; go search out your favorite waterfall, prepare to be disappointed, if you can see it at all!  There are tons of helpful Youtuber's out there with many suggestions to improve performance, visuals, etc.  Follow them all of them to the letter, some helpful, some with mixed results. In the end, you will experience so many high hopes to finally achieve a minimal acceptable performance level only to be disappointed again, and again and again. Deleting caches on almost every load up and tons of other regular maintenance is your burden and duty for now on; shame on a software developer to make us go through so many hoops just to tolerate their product!  What's next to do; delete the entire piece of software and reload fresh on every update????? No way, I'll delete it first for good, lol!  In lieu of these efforts, it's undeniable that this awful piece of software continues to degrade performance with each and every update this year!  If your system is just a couple years old in both processor and GPU, then your weathering the storm at a barely tolerable rate.  The rest of us however, are not!  My I7-9700K ""seems to"" be overburdened more and more with every passing update, however the data I have recorded does not exactly support this conclusion as I have contradicting data. (However I am not a software engineer and may not be looking at the most important data elements? Also my RTX-3080Ti seems to never be breaking a sweat, (steady at 45-55% GPU load) then a transient during the CPU spike every few minutes.  I have been recording data over the last 2 years since the purchase. Ironically though the data also shows the CPU not being overworked either, steady at 55-65% workload except every 3 minutes or so when there is a consistent CPU spike that off-loads the GPU and the frame dips for a fraction of a second to less than 10 then heads back up to a mere 23FPS in high density cities!  The only indication the CPU is over-burdened is the consistent latency spikes on some of the CPU monitors available to us on-line, indicating it's missing it's duties to send frames to the GPU,  Memory at 64GB of 3600 DDR4 is not the issue either!  My extensive testing is over a fixed area, (Downtown San Francisco), circle after circle at 500ft over the same area and over the past year I have had to steadily reduce settings to maintain the minimum Reprojected frame rate at only 23 fps!  (I used to get 30!) I see the exact problem at other high-density metro areas all around the world but my control area has always been S.F. USA.  Now I have settings so low that any lower and the visual quality is so bad it's, intolerable on my meager VR setup: a mid-low range HP Reverb G2.  Even in the rural areas, I used to get re-projected frames at 45 FPS, now it's steady at only 30 and I rarely ever see 45 FPS anymore!  There are continues and occasional stutters in cities because of only 23 FPS, but even in rural areas too all the time.  No re-projection mode= It's a stuttering mess everywhere down low, in-town or in the country: trees/buildings just blurrrrrrrrrrr on past, LOL!  What does this all mean with low CPU and GPU work load combined with abysmal FPS:  It's appears to be a poorly optomised/bloated piece of software only getting worse with every update!  At this juncture, I want to just delete the program and play other fun games that don't take a $5K system just to tolerate and still at minimum performance! And I have seen this program run on a 13900K with a 4090 on a Varjo Aero VR setup too! All that money spent and one ""STILL"" has to limit graphics settings and ""STILL"" does not achieve a totally smooth trouble free experience!  That advanced system still delivers an occasional stutter and immersion breaking morphing everywhere on the land; cliffs morphing continually as you fly past.  Buildings; sometimes there too. Even if you have an area pre-downloaded on your PC in high resolution.  Roads that look painted on and not carved into hill sides, roads under the overpasses in same direction like the program forgot to cut that part off when reaching the overpass. It's is still funny to see all these anomalies everywhere all around the world, LOL. Finally; weird holes in the earth, deep cracks in the earth that are not there for real, I even saw a river recently raised ""UP"" from the rest of the land around it but still in a larger valley for about 2-3 miles, ouch!  Looked more like a raised railroad track but with tons of sharp curves, LOL!  Still all this after 3+ years. I'm done!",1704793426,1704794620,False,2,1,0.518248140811920166,0,True,False,False

- half of my gametime on steam is just downloading the game
- if your internet disconnect during a content download, it restarts from the beginning
- pause doesn't pause the physics simulation, it only freeze the airplane position and rotation. If you cut the power during the pause, you will stall on resume
- some huge wind turbine that doesn't exist in real life right on the axis of runways (Rennes, France), some tall tree too
- dumb ATC sometimes

You are required to create a Microsoft account, this is a real pain in the nut when you want to setup children accounts, the control profile system is confusing, I can only use windowed mode - can't run it in full screen because the mouse pointer is offset to the cursor - you will learn all kinds of cuss words you didn't know you knew. Wind effects seem incomplete/basic - it just wobbles the plane around in the same repetitive motion, and the game just crashes randomly. The best part about it is the complex cockpit controls and scenery but that comes with a whopping 160Gb disk cost.

Microsoft really needs to stop forcing things down users throats, like continuously suggesting Edge being the best browser in the world (which it is far from) as if I said ""no thanks"" the last 100x on accident.

This game would happily run off of it's own 500gb ssd, and if you plan on getting the deluxe edition, establishing a sizable cache file, and maybe adding anything to that, it really wouldn't be the worst idea. You're looking at about 200+gb for the premium deluxe. I've read it's closer to 156 for the base game. I've got around 500mb/s downstream, but the only part of this games internal download process that actually showed it's download rate showed around 350-400. The initial 2gb game files you'll get from steam will come in at your bandwidth limit, but the rest will not. This did take a few hours. Also, the installer might just hang on you. You'll need to reboot at this point, but for me it was actually done downloading, so no real idea exactly how long it was done but frozen. The installation manager will also attempt to default this 156gb+ into your user app data on the c drive. You don't have to install any of this onto the c drive, but the option was not immediately available for me. I had to select another drive and go into it before the rest of my drives showed back up on the right. Once it's all downloaded and installed, you'll still have an 8gb cache file automatically created in your user app data on c anyway (yes, despite the fact that you just told the thing to put all your files wherever you specified) You'll find in the options the ability to move this cache file to a location of your choosing, as well as to amend it's size. (bigger wouldn't hurt).
Get all that out of the way and it's absolutely breathtaking. This simulator in vr is transcendent. If you've got the hardware to crank it the visuals are absolutely astonishing. You can go anywhere in the world!
That being said, I am still experiencing an occasional catastrophic system failure on this one. System crashes, and I've got to power cycle again to restore gpu functionality, And each time this happens, it takes out AMD's ""smart access memory"" requiring me to turn off and back on resizable bar in my bios, rebooting repeatedly in the process.
Running a 5900x, 64gb ddr4 3600 cl18, 6900xt, on an x570 board. Temps stay fine, the hardware isn't being overtaxed. It looks like a memory fault issue. It's quite sporadic. It's happened after flying for hours, also just a few minutes into a session.

1. MS Doesn't give a flying fk about you, your time, your bandwidth. If you move the install location via Steam it literally deletes 130+ GB in files you must re download. This may even be criminal, it absolutely should be. 

2. The installer negates any refund policy by steam as it takes hours upon hours to install via it's own installer, not Steam! Also because of this you can't limit the DL speed via Steam so that you can play other games online while this downloads in the background. 

Seriously VALVE? how do you allow this!? 

3. Installed files aren't in a single location but multiple locations. It's so convoluted that only MS could think it's okay.  Some of them you can't apparently ever move from the C drive.

4. Prepare to spend $$$ in the game to fix up cities that are auto generated and look... well not so good up close. 

5. Prepare to spend money on planes as well. For the type of person who wants to only fly say an F22 Raptor only, you can figure another 25-35 dollars for that plane. For the person who wants to fly a lot of planes you can spend over $60 each. 

There aren't a ton of planes in the base game, for a game that still costs $60 they should include another 20 planes and cities should be patched at no cost to look nice.

Between the plane costs and city costs and every thing else you could probably literally spend TENS of thousands of dollars on this ""game"" 

It's not a true Sim, it's not a true Game. It's something in between both of them. I really do enjoy playing it, I enjoy flying around in my F22, the graphics are amazing, traveling around the world is a super cool experience. 

But I will NEVER buy a MS game or product again after they criminally removed my download. A big FU to MS and frankly Steam should never have allowed that to happen as well.

Every version has its good and bad points - and this is no different.  A tradition with the flight sim is pushing the technology to the limit - you will need a high-end computer with multiple processors and dedicated graphics to run this game.  Fortunately I do have a gaming laptop PC, so I can run it fluidly.  It is also highly recommended to have a flight stick.

One of the worst failures of the new sim is the installation.  Even with a high-end computer and fast 250 mb/second internet connection, it took about 6 hours to install.

One of the best items of the new sim is the graphics - which can only be described as jaw-dropping stunning! The world and aircraft are nearly beyond true-to-life. The aircraft look like shiny metal with a hint of rust/icing if you so choose. The world has dirt blowing across runways, and individual blades of grass swaying in the wind. There are cars driving in the streets, animals in the field, and finally people that actually move instead of standing there like statues. Your ground crew gives you hand signals directing you how to park your aircraft after you land. There are lots of landmarks for you to explore to find using a ""smart cam"".

This new version also finally incorporates into flight simulator the use of real-world chart procedures for arrivals, instead  of only direct/vor-to-vor navigation.  ATC will tell you to proceed direct waypoints, clearing you for a published approach.  And, built in to the aircraft is the ability to select and edit those approaches.

Multiplayer is built in quite nicely, although there is no voice capability built in to the sim. But another aspect is taking real-time real-world aircraft, and putting them in the sim as AI traffic.  For instance, as I fly around Hawaii, I will routinely encounter Aloha and Hawaiian Airlines flights. AI traffic also uses procedures, freeing up much of the traffic congestion of previous versions.

There are numerous activities that are ready for you to try.  One of my favorite is the landing challenges, which grades you on your approach and landing to difficult airfields during adverse conditions.

A slightly disappointing feature of the new flight sim seems to be the flight model.  It seems to be overly simplified and too shaky at slow speeds. I'm tending to like multi-engine aircraft in this sim better because of the shakiness.  Trimming the aircraft is harder in this version as well. Use to the autopilot seems to negate this effect.

There are definitely still bugs in the program. The game has never errored out on me during a flight, but it has stopped responding after I land and I hit the escape button to exit to the main menu.  If I had not properly shut down the aircraft, sometimes the sim will not register the flight in the log.

The new Microsoft Flight Simulator has grown much on me, and I have flown it much more than the Steam version of FSX. The graphics really take the cake, even with a poor flight model I surprise myself (and my wife) by saying ""wow!"" under my breath for no apparent reason. I was able to locate and land a helicopter in the parking lot of my apartment complete.  The real-world graphics, incorporated from Bing maps, is detailed enough to find your own house.

The weather is system is nice - I have flown in thunderstorms to snow.  Icing does accumulate on your windshield and wings if the conditions are right. The anti-icing controls are active in the sim and seem to do a good job.

I hope this is helpful.  I waited for Flight Simulator to go on sale by 40% at Christmas to purchase it.  A new version is apparently coming out this year with an aviation career focus, so that should be interesting.  Happy flying!",1704368471,1704452445,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Wait until that situation changes or until the next game.

Adding to that, there are many blatant issues like a half-arsed broken DX12 implementation with easily reproduced graphics glitches that has not been touched in probably years, and Asobo keeps breaking vital parts of the simulation like avionics (or just the entire SDK) with moderate to severe impact especially on addon planes. Weird performance issues abound, the user interface is one of the worst in the industry, the flight model is officially worse than FSX. 

And if you encounter any issues and need to contact support, you are stuck with what I sincerely hope is some form of AI bot responding to support requests, because if that was actual humans, they are absolutely incompetent beyond advising you to just reinstall everything and hope for the best.

I used to be an X Plane 11 fan, however I do believe MSFS has out shined the X Plane franchise at this point for the following reasons: 
- Ground effect on landings is far more pronounced and accurate in MSFS

- The basic version of MSFS has a far more exhaustive selection of stock aircraft that X Plane, and the premium deluxe version, dare I say, has an absurd amount of craft to choose from right from the get go.

- P-Factor and related turning tendencies are more thoroughly modeled, wind gusts and turbulence feel much more accurate, and my favorite thing about MSFS is how at least GA planes (i.e. Cessna 172) feel during turning maneuvers when in gusty conditions.

- Communications, although really nerdy sounding (No one uses the phonetic alphabet to refer to airport identifiers and runway 29 is not ""runway two-niner""), are more robust than in X Plane, and AI traffic is more robust as well in MSFS.

Now for the negatives:
- I have experienced a couple crashes in the ~16 hours of time I've played MSFS for, which is odd to me because I'm running Windows 11 on a mid-high end PC.

- I may be missing a setting, but I find it very goofy (and annoying) that the airport I train out of (Quakertown airport (KUKT) in Pennsylvania) has airport personnel with push back machines and a fuel truck sitting on the apron, and I often also spawn nose pointing against hangar doors. Non-commercial fields should not have airport personnel at all at non-commercial airports.

- The modelling of the local airports that I fly to IRL are not very accurately modeled in MSFS - X Plane has MSFS beat in the regard IMO, albeit apples to apples the textures are more appealing in MSFS.

To be fair to X Plane, both of these sims have great communities and a slew of mods to tune just about every aspect of each game, so one can conceivably mod X Plane 12 to look as good and model flight as well as MSFS, and anything that one finds lacking in MSFS can likewise be modified. I expect, however, that MSFS will require much less effort to fine tune to my personal efforts than X Plane 12.

In closing, it seems to me that MSFS is the sim to get for both non-pilots who like the allure of aviation for pleasure and pilots-in-training as well as experienced, possibly career pilots for training.

I welcome critique and alternate points of view from the statements I make above, especially since I've historically been an X Plane player.",1704229648,1704229648,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is a totally immersive experience that really fascinates your imagination and gives you some sense of what it must be like for real pilots. Word of caution, the game is a complete platform with plenty of add-ons and mods available so it can be very system demanding. Not for the faint of Hardware...make sure you have BETTER THAN minimum requirements before even attempting to get this game. If you have a relatively robust system with good graphics, you'll fall in love - my hardware list is shared below for you, and that was an upgrade to enjoy the sim more. 
The other thing you need is time and patience to learn and enjoy the journey. I have over 5000 hours into the sim now (mostly commercial jet time) and feel like I am only beginning the journey. MSFS and the good folks at ASOBO work hard to give us a great simulation, so please be patient with them too as they continue to expand, tweak, update, comment, and blow our minds away with their amazing passion for aviation brought right to our homes!  

As a bonus, all of the Community Discussion Boards and Youtube guides available on various channels (even from real pilots) makes this a potentially serious hobby. Seriously, for you brand new folks you can literally type into the Google, Discord, or Youtube search bar, ""How do I start my [Boeing 737] in MSFS2020?"" or ""What is an ""ILS landing?"" or ""How do I calculate Take Off Performance in my Airbus A32X by Fly By Wire?"" It doesn't matter what you are looking for, someone will help you out there, YOU ARE NOT ALONE in this journey, and some of these content creators are so talented, and just salt of the earth people, I feel truly thankful for them. Remember to support them!  Happy Flying to you!

Came back this morning, nearly 12 hours later, to find it sitting at 19% completed and crawling along at a speed of like 0.1 MB/s. Apparently this is an exceptionally common issue that has been present since launch, and they've just done nothing to fix it in all the years since. It has only become worse as the game as dramatically increased in size with all the updates they've done.

Worse still, the download cannot be paused or interrupted without having to start over entirely. You can hit the pause button, but close that window and you have to restart. I lost all 19% progress by pausing the download, closing the window, then trying to change some settings recommended online before restarting the computer to start the download again.

If this was classed as an alpha or beta version - then fair enough for the (endless) update failures to download.

Final update: Steam has refused to give me a refund to this farce of a product on the basis that ""there's no evidence of a failure""... OF COURSE there's no evidence of any failure since MSFS2020 update systems are specifically *external* to Steams ENTIRE update process & ability to monitor!

REVIEW STUDIES: After going through many of the ""negative"" reviews on STEAM - SO *many* have expressed *exactly* the same problems. It's so reassuring that STEAM says there's NO EVIDENCE of any problems...

But who am ""I"" to say!? I can only speak for myself... Here are just a tiny few personal log examples that don't account for the hundreds of hours of attempts I've spent to beat the UPDATE looping (NOT GAMEPLAY!)... (all of which has *since* refused my ability to engage in this ""game"" in any sense what-so-ever, just saying):

Update: 4/4/22 at 99% of the latest 9gig update - it *LOOPED* back to zero percent.
Update: 18/5/22 Latest update - looping!!! Can't access *anything*. Over 10gigs gets to 90'sh% then Loops back to 30%.
Update: 7/6/2022; All efforts to communicate with MSFS2020 support (who-ever-they-claim-to-be) have actually failed in any resolution process of a simple software update downloads issue. Instead, their excuses of such a basic internet function have ranged from the most ridiculous of ""local"" failures (""my fault"") to an apparent phantom ""Local Content Provider"" issue, presuming some sort of global conspiracy that their contracted service providers (""proxy"" servers!?) are at fault without any accountability of any sort, and all the while completely disowning any kind of responsibility themselves.

Hope is always that the devs (whoever they claim to be) will one day actually fix things to a usable state... Until then - Stick with something that actually works like FSX.

Update (late june'sh 2022): I eventually uninstalled this product and will likely *never* attempt to reinstall it... the horror of this entire products experience *and* their ""customer service"" experience has left such a bad taste that's beyond reason for a product of this expectant calibre & price.

Summary: DISGUSTING EXPERIENCE.

Update: 31 dec 23: Obviously based on their very own posts & continued complaints from users, the update problem has not been fixed! I think it's obviously a design protocol to cash-grab and refuse server access to customers!
I'm furious and speechless at this scam - yet WHY with such an awesome proposition of an incredible flight simulator!? I just don't get it - but then profit ain't got no reasoning for customers...!!!",1645695596,1704001438,False,0,1,0.465470552444458008,0,True,False,False

I own the Fenix A320 and the PMDG 737. I have flown multiple GA aircraft in real life and was gladly able to hop into this sim and fly after doing one of the flight tutorials and a few of the discovery flights (I started in SU5 or 2021).

As I started to learn more, I finally understood the mechanics of aircraft and could finally fly without any struggles. I had recently purchased the Fenix and was able to start it up and taxi with no problems as I have completed standard startup procedures for the FBW A32NX before. If you own some of the add-ons, a VR headset that can run ultra graphics, and a PC that won't run at 15 FPS while your CPU and GPU slowly cry for help, I can definitely recommend this game. With the level of detail that it is, and all the improvements that the devs have made to it since I started in SU5, I will say this is one of my favorite games of all time, and I hope you enjoy it too.

If you want the beautiful scenery like the images look like you are going to need a good computer or an xbox or a playstation as my PC specs are: 24gb of ddr4 ram, GTX 1650 with Max-Q Design, intel core i5 11400h. I run microsoft flight simulator very well with minimum lagging when I am in very populated cities, and good frames when flying high in the sky. if you have a bad PC you can run this game, but with bad graphics. The cockpits and scenery are beautiful but one downside is that you are going to need about 120 gb of free space for the minimum game, but if you want all the scenery and airports than around 187gb.
DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE NO JOYSTICK OR XBOX CONTROLLER
this game does not support the nintendo switch pro controller or a mouse yoke because I have tried to use the pro controller and there is no way to use it. the mouse yoke does not work unless you use this special software that is janky because you can only you the mouse as a yoke and nothing else. 
the only control options this flight sim supports is a joystick or a xbox controller I think playstation can work too with some software you can also use a keyboard but it is terrible. if you are looking for a cheap joystick though you could look for a logitech extreme 3d pro as it is cheap for around 40 bucks plus tax and works very well you can pick one up at best buy. the xbox controller works for this flight sim obviously because microsoft made xbox so they only have support for their controllers which makes me frustrated but it is what it is. if you are looking for professional grade flight simulation than you should get x plane 12 as it is more realistic regarding the physics because microsoft flight simulator focuses mainly on scenery, you can get addons but the default cockpits do not have every switch mapped out. overall this game is an incredible work of art though from the scenery to the mostly detailed cockpits this game truly simulates what it is like to be a pilot.

It's not really flight simulator. Yeah the planes mostly look good and the ground scenery is nicely modeled for the most part. But I'm use to doing trans continental flights in my payware and feeling just slightly like a airline mogul, dropping cargo and passengers everywhere I fly. I just don't get that with this. MSFS 20 is like some over blown arcade game. The planes fly fine but without the realistic flight modeling of X-plane, and the plane systems seem to be lacking. It seems as if the designers never heard of autopilot. Which is in almost every GD modern plane. I can fly from a to b but it just feels like I'm always waiting for something to happen that never does. The educational components don't feel like real flight training missions but some quickly patched together shit for you to do with the simulator so they're not realistic and don't really train you in anything other than the annoyance of never being able to look around and do the things in the cockpit we've all come to expect in Microsoft Flight Simulator. I mean that literally. In FSX you can use the top hat to look around and zoom in and out. Not in MSFS 20, they messed with all the basic function keys and views meaning you need to use the mouse just to change views from inside to out and replaced the view everything with stupid zoom shots that don't allow me to use half the instruments when I need to.  You know most of the flight sim fans only wanted better graphics that run on a moderate computer, nice looking and handling planes that work and are fun to handle and the ability to fly where we want when we want. Adding more gaming things wouldn't have hurt as well, dof fighting with AI, using weapons, having a inbuilt career mode like AIrhauler2.

Original review
===========

They absolutely MUST fix the download problem before I can recommend this to anyone. It's next to impossible to actually use the simulator. I have 120 mbps connection and the best I can get updating their regular 40-100gig updates is 1-2mbps. It's insane.
===========

Ok much time has passed since the original release. Download speeds for content and updates are now not perfect but improved enough that it's liveable. The quality of the simulation itself is worth the inconveniences. Lots of good free content add ons since release. 

I like to play in VR. I've been using it with a quest3 via the new steamlink and it's worked pretty well for the most part. VR still needs some work. It's no exactly user friendly and control setups are a little touch and go, but it's quite playable if you have good enough system specs once you get through the initial setup. Once you're flying and your controls are working well the final effect is spectacular and visually unmatched by competing simulators on steam.",1627627783,1703755824,True,0,0,0.512110769748687744,0,True,False,False

Don't get me wrong, the actual simulator is great especially with third party addons when and if you actually get to the point where you can fly. So far my in-game time is 180 hours, of which something close to half has been actually flying. Rest has been spent in endless load/troubleshoot/update/reinstall-cycle. 

So far I've had to reinstall the whole simulator no less than three times which takes somewhere around 6 hours minimum each time with 100mb/s internet. I've also uninstalled and reset parts of the sim and updates way more than I should have. After Christmas I haven't been able to start the sim even once. Nothing should've happened in that time since my computer was off for the whole time, but now it doesn't get past the initial load.

Still after all of the issues I'll most likely keep playing in the future, but I could honestly only recommend this if you have incredible patience and don't mind watching terribly slow downloads accompanied by some elevator music for what seems to be countless hours.",1703704417,1703704417,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Graphics - As incredible as it is, you do have building inaccuracies, terrain inconsistency and some jaggies here and there but overall, it looks insane. 

Sound - Yeah it sounds REAL good. 

Immersion - Yeah you're definitely going to feel like you're actually exploring the world and seeing all sorts of locations while piloting your craft. It is just insane. VR will be added later on but the game just looks fantastic on ultrawide for maximum iMmErSiOn

Realism - Yeah I'm no pilot, but the planes feel awesome. There's realism difficulties for everyone. You can make it as arcadey as possible or as real as possible. Keep in mind, the default airplanes are NOT study level quality (Study meaning, you can actually fully train yourself with licensed aircraft). Yes you will definitely learn so much from them but keep in mind, they're default planes. Temper the expectations but go in wanting to have fun.

Weather - Wow. just wow. You can adjust weather on the fly and at least at medium settings, the atmosphere is just unbelievable. Kick it up to ultra and you'll be puking rainbows like those trailers you've seen of MSFS.

At the end of the day, many sites are giving it a 10/10 or a 9/10. Do I agree? Not necessarily. You are buying into an ecosystem for several years. This cannot be a 2 year cyclical game. It has a road of improvement to go through for the graphical consistencies and some flight modeling bugs. It has definitely come a LONNNNG way since the alpha but as soon as some autopilot and flight management bugs get squashed, it still has some improvement to be done.

For a newcomer I give flight sim a 9/10. It's definitely a must-fly so you can see if you want in on this amazing experience.
I give it an 8/10. I know Asobo will improve this product and Microsoft will support it through the years so my review will change but in the state that it's in, it could definitely need some polishing.

Do I recommend it? Yes for any flight sim vet/intermediate player. WTF are you doing just buy it and try it.
Newcomers? Get Gamepass and try it out.

The game wants me to download a 120GB update, which in theory should only be a matter of wating 2 minutes with my connection or 30 minutes with a proper cable/5G connection, it takes forever to download the update rendering the game practically useless for anyone with a job. To be fair, I don't get close to what my ISP claims to be able to provide, but the game downloads the 120GB update with like 10 MBit/s (not MB/s) instead of 300 MBit/s. Similarly to Microsoft Windows, I except them to deliver at least 500 MBit/s of download speeds for a software that costs 70CHF or more. I don't want to go into the whole Apple debate, but what Apple at least allows you to do is to fully utilize a fiber or 5G internet connection.

For the game itself, I can't obviously speak for the current version, but the older ones were just riddled with errors, glitched and generally unrealistic behaviour. So go for something proper like X-Plane, it's simply not worth it for the graphics to spend 15 hours of your time every few months to get some update.

Edit (December 2023):
Microsoft still hasn't bothered fixing many of the persisting problems in MSFS like the problem with slow downloads, also at least for me controller configurations get reset EVERY update. And also, the game was playable to some extend during 2021, but now it doesn't respond to anything when attempting to land (reverse thrust doesn't engage, AI tries to unalive itself, etc.).

Simply put, it has gotten to a point where like with many Microsoft products, it's unfinished, expensive and there are generally better options out there.",1621942685,1703600483,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But the main reason this game is not recommended is the extreme pricing they have on their marketplace for planes you might want to buy..  Im talking between 25-50 Euros per plane, its completely insane. Also there are no refunds thru Steam on purchases made on the marketplace. I didnt contact Steam, but it refused my refund request. 
 The game itself is extremely difficult so if you dont have the patience to watch many many youtube videos to learn the basics, dont even bother.

It requires a beefy hardware system along with 200-500GB dedicated and faster than 10mb/s internet. And a joystick. And throttle. And foot pedals. There are plenty of small stupid bugs which have never been fixed and probably never will be.  If something is wrong it will CTD and you won't know what it was. Microsoft servers will go wonky at times.  Manual/offline cache never worked right. The documentation and public relations are nonexistent from Asobo/Microsoft.  The trees are random massive and even cover up highways. Auto-gen buildings look the same and are boring. I haven't noticed snow or any seasonal changes because of some setting.  Auto-trim will probably not work along with many switches and functions on some aircraft.  The flight model is stupidly simple and a failure will bounce you back to the Main Menu without warning.  Something will annoy you to no end, eventually.   
(Stop reading now if you just want to press 'Play' and fly immediately)

Pros: The PhotoGrammetry can be absolutely gorgeous and highly detailed, down to the rivet, in the limited areas available.  Visually you might even feel 100% immersion like you're inside a real cockpit traveling above the earth.  I caught myself wanting to land my heli and walk around that pleasant neighborhood. The aircraft models are highly detailed and without any obvious flaws to my experience.  Many addons are available as well as multiplayer servers with professional pilots. Most shorelines have been polished but the broken bridges and missing boats are a distraction to be ignored.  Large cities have most of the important buildings modeled with precision. I've only found a few places where the mesh did not look exactly right such as Monaco and Hong Kong.  The entire sim will run very well (30-60fps) on a upper mid-level system without PG.  Despite the many bumps in the road it will be an amazing experience at the end.

It either endlessly downloads the same 20gbs over and over until you are forced to reinstall the entire game, or it finally actually downloads the entire update file only to then tell you that you are ""missing packages"" with no option to download them and the only option to quit the game and literally reinstall the game from scratch.

Tried going online to look up possible solutions and although this appears to be extremely common, there is no fix beyond constantly having to reinstall the game over and over again until it maybe decides to work.

Visually beautiful. Fatally flawed.
There are issues that preclude MSFS from being anything more than an arcade sim.
ATC is broken.
Save games don't work. 
IF you want to fly long haul, save the game and come back later, don't bother. The aircraft will not  remember what it is doing or where it is going. All of your work programming the flight will be gone. It will not remember essential data and will more than likely crash. 
You cannot edit an existing flight plan you can only start from scratch.
Half the key bindings don't work. 
The devs seem unable to, or unwilling to fix these basic problems with this 'sim', concentrating rather, on how it looks.
Updates break more things than they fix.
Seriously, someone at Asobo needs to go out and buy a copy of FSX and learn how a flight simulator is supposed to work.
EDIT.
As of DEC 23 I have 1293 hours logged in this sim according to Steam. I have amassed in that time, 317 flight hours.
So what have  I been doing for 976 hours? 
Waiting for an age for the game to load, Waiting for updates that download more junk aircraft and bling scenery. Trying to get broken 'study level' A310s to actually work with the sim. (bug acknowledged last December, as of end of February, still no fix). Doing Asobo's R&D, beta testing for them for free. 
Also, I do not see why I should have to use Simbrief and Vatsim to get the Flight simulator experience I paid for!
Edit 2: 07apr23
My issues with the A310 seem to have been fixed, (kind of) at least ATC treats the aircraft the same as all of the others. ATC still has problems.
No change to game saves, still broken, not working. Radio silence from Devs on this issue as far as I can see. 
Still not worth the money.
Stop the hard sell and fix the issues.
Update 1.32.7.0.
All graphics settings automatically reset defaults to DX12 which doesn't work . Game freezes GPU problem. Not my GPU only using 30% max. More like Microsoft don't know the limitations of their own OS.
ATC still gets bored and goes down the pub.
Save games still leave you Cold and Dark seven miles high. Save games. Fundamental to any game except MSFS it seems.
STILL not worth the money.
Please, for the love of god, stop the hard sell and fix the issues.
Update DEC 23 
ATC still broken. 
Still no working save games.
You have to spend an age waiting for updates, which according to Steam, is playing the game. Check out my actual flying hours...

I am spending 99% of the time making corrections because the plane refuses to just fly in a straight damn line. It always goes up and down and every plane so far has a drift to the right.

The trim wheel is the worst offender. It always seems to either make no adjustments at all or proceeds to put my plane into a nosedive. The stupid instructor of the tutorial missions drives me mad with her endless babbling over and over again. Hearing about what her flight instructor told her for the 50th time is just annoying.

There are tons of flying games (including other sims like ED) I have played and they don't have these problems. Hell, I even played around 500 hours of ED with KB/M, making great kill streaks in conflict zones with a decked out vulture. The controls were buttery smooth for what they offered and I could dance around enemies with no problem. With this game, I can't even manage to fly straight because the plane seems to do things on its own without any interaction. I put my gamepad on the table and can literally see the VS of the plane going up and down and drifting off to the right every time.

I also tested playing FSX with the controller. The controls there are MUCH smoother and flying is actually fun. How Asobo managed to make the controls worse than on a 17 year old game is beyond me.

EDIT: VR is even worse. In the training flights with the Cessna, the throttle just outright refuses to work. I put it to 100% but the plane stay where it is, brakes are also set to off. When I put the headset and controllers down and start typing, it suddenly springs to action.

Now playing the game also bugs out my controller. It is still displayed as connected in Windows, but the light on the controller is flashing. I can't use the controller and the inputs are not being registered by the game anymore. This only happens AFTER I start FS. I have to completely turn off bluetooth and remove the controller/repair it for it to work again.

Embark on a virtual adventure where the sky's the limit. Microsoft Flight Simulator allows you to experience the intricacies of aviation, from takeoff to landing, providing a truly authentic flight simulation experience. üõ´üåÑ

The hallmark of Microsoft Flight Simulator is its unparalleled realism. The flight simulation is so lifelike that it feels like you're genuinely soaring through the clouds. The attention to detail in replicating real-world landscapes, airports, and weather conditions is nothing short of breathtaking. Each flight is an educational and awe-inspiring journey through the skies. üèûÔ∏èüå¶Ô∏è

The play of light during different times of the day and dynamic weather effects contribute to an immersive world that feels alive. üåÜ‚ú®

Navigating your aircraft feels like a true captain's responsibility.

I pre-purchased the premium deluxe edition 4 years ago, yet I only have 72 hours play on it (at time of writing).  The majority of that is through installing and updating the software, before the Xbox version came out. 
To be able to use this software properly you need to purchase a flight yoke and rudder pedals. Because Honeycomb and Logitech (the only affordable and viable options for these controllers) gave all their products to You Tubers during Covid, it took nearly 2 years before I was able to purchase these at a very inflated price, however I was able to make a few short flights, all was good (except the load time), and I was staring to enjoy the game.  
Microsoft then brought out the Xbox version and since then I haven't even been able to login to use this software. I don't have a Xbox, I have a PC, yet it still wants me to sign in to a Xbox account before I can even play this.  I have tried to come back to the game on several occasions to see if by some miracle the Xbox login had been removed, but no change there.
It seems this franchise is going the way of many others (""The Golf Club"" been the worse case of this) and abandoning PC players, for console players, yet still scamming the PC players for their hard earned cash, in my case, ¬£120.00 for the software, ¬£600.00 for the hardware, and well over ¬£250.00 for add-ons which were purchased before the Xbox version came out (purchasing from the in game store is another horror story, being charged twice, and then not getting the add-ons), so nearly ¬£1000.00 wasted on a game I'm not even able to play.  
I feel Microsoft and Asobo have totally conned me with this game, and I advise anybody who intends to play this on PC, to seriously think again before purchasing.",1702901076,1702901076,False,1,0,0.497292935848236084,0,True,False,False

When you launch the game and start downloading the ""updates"", that time counts against your 2hrs play time window for requesting a refund. You'll not have had a chance to play yet and will be ineligible for a refund. You've been warned.

The initial download of the game, including all the ""updates"" took me 3 days. Not kidding I left my computer on for three days to install this and that's what it took. I downloaded CoD Cold war in an hour and that was about 170gb so 150gb should never take that long.

Second, regardless of what Steam shows as your game being up to date, when you launch if there's an update guess what? You get to spend a whole day again installing an update that took the same rate of speed as when you were installing the game the first time.

I don't know how or why, but this simulator is almost virtually impossible to play half the time. When it does work it is incredible, but for the cost......

Fly anywhere around the world, in most any flying thing made by the original developers or mod makers.

No damage modelling, unfortunately. At least landing gears and control surfaces should be crumple-able, with plenty of sparks sparking about when scraping to a stop, please.

A built-in dynamic campaign where you can have a home airfield and make cargo deliveries and other odd jobs would be nice. Currently one is provided by Neofly.net

1. Buggy and feels like incomplete software
2. Updates only within the app itself, and won't update in background or overnight like normal software, likely to artificially increase the apparent ""hours played"" on services like Steam.  Probably not a problem if you're unemployed but if you sit down to play, expect to load the game then wait 1-2 hours for a MANDATORY update
3. In-game store full of garbage and hard to identify items of actual value amongst the plethora of re-skinned planes with default flight models
4. In game ""addon packs"" are priced at approximately double the pre-purchase packs; just predatory pricing for those that would otherwise support the franchise.  i.e. $48-60 for standard, premium deluxe is $96-120.  However in-game ""upgrade"" isn't $48-60 extra, it's $85-100.  For a 787 with a crap flight model?  Cool.  
5. Flight models are generally poor on all but the most popular planes (although the 787 is crap too), probably because of publisher pressure for commercial priorities over ""true to sim"" / gaming priorities

Pros:
1.  Absolutely BEAUTIFUL, can't fault the incredible recreation of the feeling and atmosphere - well done.  To be fair, the other sims on the market have all caught up substantially, but it's clear packaging and appearance are the priority for MSFS over all else
2.  The massive marketing machine of MS = driving interest in aviation and I can't be sad about that
3.  A 1.5 hour flight IRL costs $300-ish anyway

Overall if you're a teenager and your parents are rich, I guess have them buy you this, but I only load it up to show other people how pretty flying can be.  Otherwise I'd personally rather play DCS when I want to sim combat planes, I play X-Plane 12 for all other plane sims (their ""beta"" was more stable than this ""final""), and I load up star wars squadrons to fly around and blow stuff up.

UPDATES: ""You've played an additional 26 hours""
Sorry, but I have not.  I've got a solid 24 hours of updates in with 2 hrs of play.  In the same timeframe I've played >200 hrs of DCS, 50 hrs of X-Plane 12.  I'm reinstalling this now to show off the graphics of my new sim setup.  It can be fun, and it's a beautiful flight experience, but if I want to actually ""sim fly"", I'm going to one of those other options.  MSFS is useful to scope out scenic locations, and would be fun intro-level sim if the publisher tried to monetize *valuable* additions to product (I'm thinking things like more than 2 planes with flight models, working avionics, or training that even described basic procedures, stalls or steep turn or anything (although you'd need a flight model...)).  

But hey instead there are loads of skins, which DOES simulate how I feel about the color of the plane I'm flying -- which is that I do not care at all.

You cannot refund the game after having played with it because the first download takes more than 2 hours time off of your try playing time. When the game runs, it is very hard to browse through the menus 'cause it scrolls down an left in not time so it is difficult to select a menu item that scrolls away. I ran the simulator and, although the software knows there is a VR headset connected, it won't start in VR so you have to use ctrl+tab to switch to VR mode. It does not recognize a vr headset when I use Steam Link on my Quest 2 headset which is also a disappointment. Then, I end up in VR BEHIND the plane as default. As if anyone prefers to sit behind the plane in stead of IN the cockpit behind the controls when using vr. Does MS even knows what the main purpose of VR is? So then you have to switch to the cockpit with the 'end' key and, if you're lucky, you can fly from within the cockpit without hanging o crashing. There is little depth perception when I'm watching the view.
Now, the game stucks in a loop when I try to fly in VR, so I miss stability and I am reluctant to continue trying to make it work 'cause I'm afraid I cannot deal with the disappointment anymore. Maybe I should stick with X-Plane. This is a typical MS product as far as I can see right now: Expensive and impractical and unstable.

The game crashes sometimes.

The annoying search for updates page takes a lot of time and in the end there are no updates !

The physics in the game are almost non-existent. I don't know if this is the physics of a real plane, but it is very difficult to land .

The plane's sound is very low .


 Replay mode sticks to you every time you turn it on from settings

The replay mode does not automatically record the trip for viewing or recording after the trip .

I uninstalled the game and only played the game for 28 hours. These are the problems I have encountered in this game since I bought it. There are also minor problems that I will not mention.

I hope that in the next game all the problems will be fixed and the physics of the plane will be fixed.

After half an hour of waiting then troubleshooting I gave up and admitted to myself that I had wasted almost two hours on this game without ever making it past the menu.

MSFS can certainly be fun, but, this game is in a consistently broken state. 

First off requiring updates to be downloaded from within the game would downright frustrating even if the game managed to update quickly and consistently. Secondly the aircraft in this game have a shockingly large number of issues, missing functionality, and once again, are inconstant between aircraft. Weather is always buggy even at cruse (the wind will instantly swap directions at least once in flight so get used to it) and the flight planing in game is best ignored. I've ran this game through both the xbox app and here on steam and neither time did the game remember any of my previous flights and it would frequently change my settings too. 

Basically this game is alot like windows itself in that the original was good, yet it and all the other games since serve as the shaky foundation that the rest of this game is built on.

TLDR -

The f*king ""deluxe"" verison of this ""sim"" is dogwater, why waste an extra 60 valuable dollars on some default half baked undercooked base trash when you can download everything on f*king simplaza. Literally everything default about this game sucks absolute as*hole. Just go to simplaza like me and download 1.5 terabytes of addons, scenery, dlc and aircraft and this will just *then* become playable uh i mean flyable. Flight model is dogwater, performance is dogwater, the bing maps photo scenery is dogwater, everything that isnt modded is dogwater, the menus are dogwater, the control options and cfg screens are absolutely horrendous looks like it was made by an autistic french 8 year old. I would remove all of it and make it actually something readable instead of an hour long headache trying to config my goddamn thrustmaster sidestick and throttle quadrant for each aircraft. The only good viable aircraft to fly is the PMDG 737, the Fenix A320 and the FSS E170 that is still currently in beta but is out performing every default aircraft in this game combined. Please make FS2024 better, This half baked pile of shit is just about as good for flying at 38,000 at night and taking screenshots because whenever you get below 10,000 ft it turns into a stuttering f*ckfest. Yes I love aviation, I am working on my ratings now. But X-Plane 12 developed and lead by literally one person is outdoing the literal sh*t out of a multibillion dollar company headed by some french people who only have one accomplishment ever in the history of aviation in france and that is making the airbus series aircraft. MAYBE NEXT YEAR WE CAN ACTUALLY GET SEASONS AND BETTER FPS THANKS MICROSH*T LOL.

For all the good it does, It fails at being usable software. The camera system is 100% broken in both settings and saves. Keybinds are bad - there is 'turn off avionics' next to the outside view key, and the button underneath escape catapults you up 10,000 feet. The UI is fullscreen and badly organised in a list view - there are general settings and control settings, but graphics are under general for no apparent reason. There is no tower view, the replay feature is there but you need to jump through hoops to use it - and mine is still greyed out unusable. The download manager will often fail at a random percentage and restart, leading to hours and hours of frustration just to download a gigabyte of data. If you lose your internet connection a giant error message pops up and you lose all your control inputs - woe betide you if you were lined up on final. Most of the aircraft are the most generic uninspired GA you could imagine - taildragger with G1000, Baron with G1000, Cessna with G1000... AND it doesn't quit when you exit so steam keeps clocking up hours. Approx 75% of my game time is actually downloading their updates. ""Content manager"" is what where you'll find your addons - and what's the logical place to find it? Marketplace obviously! 

And don't buy the Carenado PC12, the gauges have a memory hole that reduces the game to a slideshow. I've wasted probably 8 hours finding that.  

--

-Flight plans cannot be opened through the avionics (GPS)
-Crash sound is 'tinnitus' 
-Search doesn't work unless you know the ICAO
-Airport traffic drives around airports getting in the way
-No restart button on flights
-Warning messages steal focus from your controller (and you crash)
-Warning messages appear in the middle of the screen 
-Crosswinds are too strong making it impossible to take off

Hadn't played since April, thought I'd give it a few spins before my new VR headset arrives, and it crashes to desktop from the black screen before there's even a logo displayed or anything.

They've broken the game in the 8 months I've had it and they're already off to work on the next version of the sim. Love to pay money for things that don't work.

12 hours of hunting and pecking through forums, Windows reinstalls, memory tests, and more finally led me to the culprit -- I just had to shut down the internal Windows audio server to launch the game, then I could re-enable it through Task Manager after the game launches. You know, normal stuff! Not a thing had changed on my system since I last played it so I have to assume this is something MS broke on their end. The frustration with this software is REAL.

Good things:
-really good  graphics
-mostly realistic flight model and airplane design
-immense selection of aircraft to choose from
-ability to chose airport spawn point from a map and just freedom to control the flight
-missions and different things to do than just fly around randomly
-the replayability, i have spent whole days doing nothing but flying around 
-no real bugs
-scenery looks way better than X-plane 11 if you're comparing sims
-adding on to scenery, it uses bing maps satellite view so you can set waypoints at your house and see your house in the sim which is pretty cool (if you have maxed out graphics)

not so nice things:
-impossible to refund the game because the installer takes over 2 hours even if you have nasa pc and wifi and also testing out the game and configuring and all that takes over an hour
-premium deluxe version takes up around 350GB of disk space
-pretty poor optimisation, the minimum requirements say 8GB of ram but you will need atleast 16 to enjoy the game properly
-base airliners have all panels and switches modeled but some don't actually do anything
-no good boeing aircraft included
-no good turboprops included
-don't buy this game if its not on sale or unless you're rich
-it is possible to play on controller but not ideal at all so don't buy it if you don't have a flight stick

conclusion:
good game if you want scenery, aircraft variety, graphics and realism. however if you don't have much space on your disk, have a slow internet connection and a bad pc in general you might want to reconsider.",1679024663,1701827505,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

I haven't played the game yet and I don't think you should try either. This seems to be only 1/5 downloads/updates

This entire time has just been the game downloading, I have experienced no gameplay and the download speed slows down the further I get into the download, it has probably been way more than 14 hours because steam doesn't update the playtime frequently while the game is launched. Basically the entirety of the game is downloaded inside the game with their shitty servers and way slower speed than any other download and this only seems to be 1/5 downloads. Normally the download would've been done within an hour on my computer, but this is way longer and then some more.

It's not even worth it for what the trailers show, which is usually way more quality than the game itself.

And before you say it's something wrong on my side, I have terrifically good internet and have the game's priority on high in the task manager. This is a known issue and if I can experience it, so can literally anyone else. The download speed is now under 4Mbits/s and decreasing. I only just got to 90% and I've heard of people who spend 80+ hours downloading the game while I researched this issue.

This game is absolute dogshit and should instead be a simulator for horrible internet connections, if there is no fix for this problem and Valve doesn't give me a refund, then I'm fucking done with everything Microsoft related. Microsoft is absolute dog urine filled dog water that is out of touch with the rest of the world.

If you want to know what slow internet feels like, this is the game for you, if you're willing to pay a high fee.

Edit: It's been at 95% for several hours and seems to be stuck that way with no more than 3Mbits/s in download speed

However, there are some downsides to keep in mind:

- KB&M support is tacked on, barely works, and it's basically impossible to fly without some kind of joystick. However, gamepad for basic flight and keyboard for advanced instruments works fine, as does VR with motion controls.

- The marketplace is borderline a scam, most of the planes on it are poorly made, with limited or no support for VR motion controls, and some lacking support for cockpit controls (clicking on switches) entirely. If you plan to use it, don't buy anything with a low rating, and even then be aware that it probably won't work with most control systems.

- The ATC system is terrible, and user made ATC systems like Vatsim are even worse. I recommend flying with ATC entirely turned off, or with a private group that has someone roleplaying ATC from the ground. You can't collide with other planes so ATC is more for roleplaying purposes anyways.

- The officially made planes, which are the only ones really worth flying, are very limited in numbers. Most of them are civilian aircraft, which is not a bad thing, but worth keeping in mind if you're more into military aircraft. There's also very few helicopters, and no non-helicopter rotorcraft at all. This is a plane game, don't get it expecting to fly anything else.

- There is no ingame chat of any sort, if you want human interaction you best find people out of game to fly with.",1655526323,1701783754,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game's content download system is so slow/bad to the point that you will be out of Steam's refund eligibility by the time you actually start playing the game.  

With MSFS 2024 right around the corner, I would highly advise you do NOT buy this game UNLESS you want the Aircraft included with the Base & Deluxe Editions of the game to use in MSFS 2024, because it has been confirmed that any aircraft usable in MSFS 2020 (Yes that also includes the Aircraft given to you by purchasing the Base or Deluxe Editions of the game, such as the Boeing 787-10 & F/A-18E) can be carried over to MSFS 2024. If this is your intention for purchasing this game, I would highly advise you wait for it to go on sale.

It had its fair share of bugs and quirks over the years, but Asobo has put in a lot of hard work stabilizing and optimizing the sim. Having come from FSX, I highly enjoy this sim and strongly feel that it is a worthy successor.

Flight models are slightly less realistic than you'd find in other flight sims, but the inclusion of Bing Maps streaming and AI photogrammetry introduces a simply stunning real-world experience you can't find anywhere else.

I'm not recommending it to new simmers at this time due to Microsoft's active development of Flight Simulator 2024, and would recommend that new pilots save their investment until the release of the new MSFS.

If you decide to own MSFS 2020, steel yourself for some epic download estimation times with the base game *and* all free DLC regional packs coming in well over a whopping 250GB.",1626662992,1701241545,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Update: November 2023 - CTDs inbetween flights is also still a thing. Do too many things in a row and you crash when going back to the main menu. The heading bug of death is also still not fixed. Use the keybind for the heading bug a little to much, it gets stuck in a spin and the game will not react to any other imput anymore. ALT-F4 is the only way out. Unplugging USB devices may help but also often results in CTDs. Unplugging USB devices generally is likely to cause a CTD. 

Update: October 2023 - Random CTD during the flights are also still a thing. Rather than fixing some of the major issues of this sim, they opted to announce the release of a new one, so one can expect none of the listed below will ever get fixed.

Update: Jan 2023 - Long haul flights still cause immense FPS drops down to 25-10fps. This issue has been widely discussed on the official forums years. Asobo seems unable to fix this. Really makes serious airliner flying a huge let down. Apart from that many issues have been sorted out. Many I have listed below I haven't tried to reproduce now.

January 2021: Performance has been improved, but so many of the issues I complained about are STILL not fixed. Now they even managed to break the ""set optimal mixture"" key. It will stall your engine and won't let you set your mixture for seconds. They also managed to totally litter the world map with sightseeing POIs, even though you are not zoomed in. 
Adding new aicraft like the Hornet is nice, but it really feels like a toy. I don't expect it to be 100% but it could at least be as good as the FSX version. FAR from it.

October 2021: Still a broken mess. Losing controls mid fligiht, because the game will stop reacting to mouse and keyboard, because I dared to use the keybind to turn the header. That bug was there on release and they still haven't managed to fix it. 

If you are not a die hard flight simulator fan, stay away! At this point it is a buggy mess. Likes to crash and many features just do not work properly.

They messed up so many basic stuff up, it's unforgivable for such a hugely anticipated release. These are all I collected in roughly 5 hours of gameplay, plus the initial download time.

- forced music on initial start all the way through the roughly 4 hour download on a 150mbit line
- Disabling FS sound via the audiomixer worked until it did not, and played the annoying 1 minute looped music again
- It did not recognize my quite common (yet stone age, IK) MICROSOFT percision joystick 2, FSX would automatically assign controls to
- It did automatictally recognize my XBOX360 controller, would even show a graphic of the design, but not show the actualy bindings (FIX THAT!)
- It simply applies numbers to the buttons 1-X instead of calling them X, Y, B, A. RB, RT and so on. Have fun finding out wich is which. It's YOUR hardware. That is not properly included???? 
- When assiging keys and you assign a key which has already been assigned it may alert you, but it will not give you the option to auto unassign the old binding, but have both assingend at the same time, so you have to find that old binding through the 2000 options and unassign it for yourself (what the actual heck????)
- I had to unplug all my other controllers I have, which it said to not have recognized, because they would still mess with my inputs. Only happened in EA games so far. Good job MS, not asking me to simply ignore their inputs, unless I assign them!
- The whole design of the menu is questionable. Multiplayer is not really distinctive it seems, but thanks to the lack of an actual in game tutorial how to go about free flight and online mode, etc, it's all the same anyway. 
- Great to have spent 120‚Ç¨ to have many airports and planes, select them and look for liveries and I have not yet found one where I could actually change a livery. Wow.
- The great FFM (Frankfurt) airport EDDF has unassiged taxi ways simply showing the letter ""X"". I paid for that! FIX!!!
- Custom realism presets can not be saved!
- You can NOT save and reload your current flight simulation (if so, why hide it?)
- It was absolutely not obvious how to comminicate with other players fling around, even with all assits on
- You can't quickly tell players from AI traffic

Aside from these aspects, it's a solid thing. I find the menu utterly horrible. MS may reach out to me, if they wanna know what I think how to improve that.

Live weather worked like a charm. The overall flight simulation and cockpits are top notch. The many inop buttons are a shame, especially on the PRICY models like the dreamliner. For whatever reason I always start with 50% fuel. The ATC is extremely clunky and is even less fun to operate than in FSX. I made the dreamliner crash the entire game, no error message, could only ALT F4 out of it. Changing weather seetings gives me some solide freezes sometimes, for up no a few seconds. Using the steam overlay even in paused simulation will have the game recognize my inputs, which can turn out pretty nasty.

Edit: After an additional 13 hours I have had a few crashes to desktop without any error message. Happened when starting a flight. Happened when touching the wrong systems on certain planes. Happened after changing the weather. 

Edit No2: Another 22 hours later
The 747 is basically broken. The AP is ocmpletely crazy. It does all sorts of things and cant even manage to keep altitude when set correctly. UNACCEPTABLE.",1599600817,1701238332,False,0,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Oh, and bugs are common. Sometimes autopilot will just turn the plane in circles, sometimes your ATC controls will vanish and you will be powerless as your plane gets backed into a building by ground control, forcing a restart of the flight.

But the best part is that the developers continue to push content on the marketplace as well as plan for MSFS 2024 while people complain about the issues that have been present since launch.

I got frustrated when I couldn't get my controllers to work with MSFS (standard version), so I requested a refund.

I thought that I would never get the refund after it showed me playing for 14 hours - even though that was all downloading time - with less then 2 hours of actual playing time. 

But then I solved the controller problem after the refund request was done.

So now, I re-bought MSFS at the more expensive premium version - mainly because I felt so overjoyed at getting the refund for the standard version. 

Yes, making customers feeling happy by treating them fairly and right can actually make more money for you.

This is a problem for the customer experience, returns through steam are just not possible, and while I'm sure there are good server reasons that the files must be downloaded through the game itself, it is agonizingly slow. 

As far as the game itself goes,
It is flight simulator, if you like it you like it. don't play it if you aren't at least familiar with the basics of flight sims. A lot of negative reviews seem to fail to grasp that flying in real life (a simulator is supposed to get as close as possible to real life while maintaining fun, by definition of the genre) is not easy, and must be LEARNED. If you want arcade-y easy-to-grasp flying, maybe don't play simulators. That being said, I wish there were better tutorials for the sim genre in general. The graphics are pretty damn good considering what the game is, once again somehow people are expecting literally the ENTIRE EARTH to be modeled and rendered in high-quality at close distances. I actually have a hard time believing that those people aren't just being purposely obtuse with that criticism. I feel a better terrain and flora generation system would be doable however, and I wish some parts of the game weren't so unrepresentative of their real life counterparts, specifically a distinct lack of trees in very heavily wooded areas, but once again, this game can't do literally everything.

If you are new to flight sims, be aware that you MUST watch videos and might need to even start in a more beginner-friendly game before being able to fully grasp some of the confusing amounts of controls and advanced flying concepts.

1. It keeps crashing randomly. No indication as to why. My system is overkill for the settings that I'm running, and it will still crash whether in game or in the main menu. 

2. The DRM is broken. When starting the game, both after a crash and after a normal startup, it randomly decides to forget your login and resets everything to default, making you go through all the setup menu and rebind all controls. 

These are the main issues that have killed the game for me. They are problems known in the FS forum since launch, and still not fixed.

Nice graphics, decent flight modelling and fun to sight-see, but a terrible launcher with horrid download speeds that completely turns me away from wanting to get back into MSFS.

Long version:
The sim itself is fine, it's fun flying around and seeing things with the graphical fidelity that MSFS has managed to achieve. The plane selection (after 3 years mind you) is fun, with a mix of old and new, my personal favourite of the free planes being the DC-3 (as of November 2023.)

HOWEVER.

When it comes to downloading the actual content, MSFS falls flat, hard. I was constantly limited to about 5 Mbits per second, yes BITS, not BYTES. That's less than 1 MB/s (1 MB = 8 Mbits) for downloading 55 GB worth of content. Not only does the download itself take a long time, but it also decompresses and optimises the files during the download and then your download speed tanks again for each new file. You're looking at an entire day or more just to download content to make the sim's locations look decent. Why is this the case? Why is a game developer with a publisher as big as Microsoft still unable to fix this issue 3 YEARS AFTER LAUNCH? I really hope that FS2024 fixes the launcher, because if not, it will not be worth giving Asobo any more money for a sim that takes 100x longer than it should to download. I can download Red Dead Redemption 2, a 112 GB game, in about 45 minutes. This should not be taking as long as it is, Asobo.

As long as the launcher continues to be this bad, I cannot recommend this flight sim as you will go well over the refund time just downloading the game. Out of my 141 hours, I think a solid 20 - 25 are from downloading mandatory-update content for this game. That's insane. Do better, Asobo.",1700946258,1700946258,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Many of these bugs were also in FSX.
You need lot of additional softwares to be able to play without bugs.

The general ATC system, the autopilot system of the planes, the side systems of the planes, the navigation systems and ILS, even the simplest tools like the lights inside the plane have many problems.For example you need an additional mod to add lights in night to the airport gateways unless you can't see anything.

Similarly, for long flights, for example, from London to New York, there is an option called ""Fast Travel"" or ""Travel To..."" which does not work properly and is not useful at all and is full of bugs, so you have to say goodbye to IFR flights , because at least in FSX you could activate sim rate up to 16x in autopilot mode, but in this version you can use up to 4x, and if you put more than 4x, everything will fall apart.

The new FS is only worth flying with a small plane on a short route.

With so many bugs the pleasure of a long IFR flight with a 787 jet is taken away from the user.


It is regrettable that this simulator is not well supported with all this potential, and even though it has been almost three years since its release and many updates of high data volume, it is still not usable.

The conclusion is that compared to FSX, the graphics are 100% better, more realistic, and more enjoyable, especially in the details of the aircraft, but in the development and simulation of a jet systems, it appears very basic and disappointing and has no resemblance to reality. It is not much different from FSX.

From the moment you take off, it's clear this isn't your average flight simulator. It's like ""Airplane!"" meets ""Top Gun,"" with a dash of ""Hot Shots! Part Deux."" Imagine trying to navigate a storm while Leslie Nielsen's voice echoes in your cockpit with unsolicited advice. You're trying to focus, but you can't help but laugh as your co-pilot, who bears a striking resemblance to Lloyd Bridges, decides it's a bad day to quit sniffing glue.

The graphics are so realistic you'll feel like you're in the cockpit with Tom Cruise, sporting aviator sunglasses, of course. And the attention to detail? Simply stunning. You might even find yourself humming ""Danger Zone"" as you execute a perfect barrel roll, only to be interrupted by a voiceover asking if anyone on board can fly a plane ‚Äì a nod to the classic scene from ""Airplane!""

The controls are intuitive enough for beginners yet challenging for seasoned pilots. Whether you're dodging birds in a nod to ""Sully"" or attempting a landing on an aircraft carrier a la ""Top Gun,"" every flight is an adventure.

But it's not all about the thrills. The game has its share of comedic Easter eggs, like a mission where you have to deliver inflatable autopilots or a cameo appearance from a rubber chicken as your flight mascot.

In summary, Microsoft Flight Simulator is the perfect blend of high-flying adventure and side-splitting comedy. It's more than a game; it's an experience that leaves you feeling like a true pilot, albeit with a few more laughs. So, if you're ready to fly, laugh, and maybe quote a few classic movie lines, this is the simulator for you.

Takes about 10hrs to download on a gigabit connection because of Microsoft's servers. Then, I played for 5 minutes, it crashed. And now anytime I try to load the game it takes 15 minutes to load and when the little loading bar finally reaches the end and you think its about to start, it stalls and freezes.

Honestly i don't think that instructions are clear enough to understand and remember them quickly.
Handy guide with all terms explained and all binds to what does what would be great. Also objectives showing how u should do what (for example i tried turning of my aircraft system and after 30 minutes I still didn't figure out how to do it).

Graphically, an immense step up from previous simulators, using Bing Maps and Azure technology to stream in near-photo realistic surrounds in the simulator, with live weather, live aircraft, etc. Although the simulator takes quite a beefy rig to play when you do find yourself in the thick of things you will be consistently taken aback by how beautiful the simulator can be. Your first flight and first few experiences will be breathtaking, whimsical, and exhilarating.

About a year I was stated that this is not the best simulator, in my case however it's getting closer and closer by the day, in fact, it's starting to be like a simulator more than just a game. It is great in so many ways at least but not it's not worth paying ¬£120 for the full package. I cannot stress how UK eccentric this is though, as the majority of photorealistic cities are in the UK. Even FSX had high def bump mapping and scenery in the UK and USA, and the rest of the world was lower quality, much lower lol. Still, with more products and addons being released, I'm changing my mind regards to that. Yet FSX is 20 years old. As for flight controls, I upgraded (2022) to a great device ""Thrustmaster TCA Captain Pack Airbus Edition"" before I was using a cheap Logitech joystick and the setup is so easy but a pain in the butt at times, and when you are able to get it to work, it works very well, plus once set up right, you no longer have to play around with those settings as it's saved to the cloud. On that note, third-party developers also make flight controls easy with their products and own built-in setup whiten in their EFB. The simulator has sensitivity controls, and over five pages of A4 are needed to print out the keyboard assignments. One downside is that two of those pages are for camera controls, and there is no replay built into the simulator, however, you can pick up a freeware addon!

Then, the honeymoon phase will wear off. The more you learn about the aircraft provided, the more you learn the avionics systems and how to actually pilot these planes, and the more frustrated you will become. There are still glitches and more rampant. It can be from something annoying, like having to press a button a couple of times in a row to get it to act right, to something game-breaking, like engine failures, autopilot crashing you to the ground, or autopilot not letting you follow your course. I haven't even scratched the surface, but the two main planes I personally enjoy flying are getting there. Third-party devs, like the FlyByWire team for the A320, are amazing, they have come down a long road to get to the point where they are now. I cannot help but feel sorry for those who had issues in the first weeks, but the truth is that many issues have been fixed, and fairly quickly. FSX is around 16 years old, and I have been using it for the last six to seven years and had fun with it, it worked out to ¬£3 a year (PAid under ¬£10). If this one keeps going for 10 years maybe 20 years, it's going to be worth it. 

Now in 2022, it's incredible the amount of modern-day DLC and payware addons for the simulator that you can get your hands on, from 100s to 1000s of freeware to payware, Yes expect bad and good addons. I always ask you to review before buying third-party addons, and also these that support regular updates. When first announced regards the simulator we had nothing, now we have the Boeing 737 series from PMDG and Aaerosoft has confirmed that they are aiming to release A321, A330 and also A350 as mentioned they already have Twin Otter (DHC-6 ) and CRJ 550/700 available to buy from the marketplace. Those that are legitimate about flying may also hear about the Fenix a320 coming in late summer. I expect my flight sim to be more complete by the end of 2022 with payware to good freeware aircraft, at least two good freeware helicopters, and all the functions of FSX in this one, so to find that the A321 in FSX has more functionality than the default A320 was disappointing, yet I fly the FlyBywire mostly. That coupled with the fact that Asobo is knowingly and admittedly rushing out patches from the start and continuing to break things as normal, however, they are improving and had many fixes and happens that when you fix things something breaks the simulator with each patch as normal but that's Microsoft for you, that being said we had amazing third-party developers like FlyBywire and salty for the 747 mod make a stranded default aircraft in something more realism. The phrase, ""one step forward, two steps back"" certainly was a big problem from the start and now, It's improved by a long dog. We learn from mistakes and also find a workaround for in-game bugs and errors, I'm not a game developer, and while like most people realize that modern-day publishers do not force developers to rush development as they want the finished workable product, it's just not acceptable in the realm of reality to push broken patches and break the game in such a manner, especially when a said company doesn't really do hotfixes.

The community meanwhile is growing, growing fast. There are so many addons/mods available, and the A32NX project is restoring the functions of the A320 MFD for free. We already have so many airports being released for free and utilities as well, so many that I can't keep up with it all myself. It's not all pay to play. For those who are into 747, we have a developer of daily making their own standalone 747 Aircraft, plus freeware workable simbrief integration A330 that uses the FlyBywire system. If you have forked out a small fortune for the Premium package, it's a real shame that there aren't many aircraft and from the start, you really think we should get two helicopters for free, instead, we get them through the world update packages. Or they release as extra money-making, Similarly, there is float/seaplane to get rather for free or payware, and that also is a bit off. As years go on we are finally getting more. So this is a technically impressive simulator, the scenery, graphics and AI are pretty high quality though, and flying at night and across scenery in the daytime is pretty damn amazing. It's great, beautiful, and serene at times when it works, but it will hopefully be addressed in time. it's going to be a long road still since the release back in 2020. Yet, as I'm typing now, it's amazing how far it has come alone. I have read reports that tell you the flight characteristics improving, aren't like when it was first released, once again thanks for the great support from the community, from others flying the Cessna 152 in real life, I know they will eventually improve it as time goes on, but given the way things are going, I have read people saying ""you shouldn't be able to fly upside down!!"" You know what? I don't care, most are in for the enjoyment, Myself for the realism. I used to use FSX and P3D and have flown too many aircraft, and this one is 10 times more realistic than FSX. I have also watched and listened to several real-world airline pilots flying the A320neo in the sim, and they are saying it's pretty realistic, so I think we have to say that it is more than 55% realistic or using third-party aircraft is 80% with the A320N, and at the end of the day, that's good enough for most people.Not everybody will share this ""zero-criticism"" but when you try to model 110,000 airports around the whole world, even 0.5% is going to be a large NUMBER of mistakes. The WHOLE world's terrain and is impressively accurate, but with the help of mainly freeware mod. MSFS has still a way to go but is almost endlessly expansible too; the default install package includes 

To conclude, I absolutely love this Flight Simulator game but it has a few flaws to it that I can recommend for new players unless you're a pilot or trainee or a beginner like me that very fully invest in Simulator games I highly recommend it!",1615906287,1700747068,True,2,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Edit: when it works

Managed to play around 3 hours, the remaining 7 were downloads, patch fixes, crashes to desktop ect

I play on the easiest mode with a controller, anyone can enjoy this game or sim when on expert mode.

Very easy to fly and Ive flown from the UK to France, day to night and its amazing, looks so damn good, its the best looking game i have from all of my 350+ games

Now when it works i can honestly say its so interesting flying, but when it doesnt works its hugely fustrating, the 1.8.3.0 patch kind of messed up the game files and you really dont want to do a fresh install as its 100s Gb data

For those who have managed to experience trouble free sessions they have left positive feedback

For those who have tech issues like me will have left negative reviews, now I must figure what to do to fix this issue I have, as I am missing the fun,

Ill update later on......

Major updates have further enhanced this simulator, its just glorius now, did a flight from Paris to London, full flight, exactly how I remember it from a few weeks ago.

Edit:

so its been roughly 4 months since release, and I must say the patch fixes and the updates have been continuous and regular, this in fact has completely changed the game, honestly as a casual gamer, im no expert on simulators, ive never flown aircraft before, the experience is breath taking and spectacular.

As mentioned I play on a controller on easy settings, that means anyone can enjoy this game, you don't need the latest hardware or flight sticks

The easy mode is like arcade mode playing GTA or Ace combat, that easy, I dont experience and game issues now, so its so relaxing playing this sim, choose your departure and arrival destination and take off, so far the furthest ive flown was like 1500 miles, though if you have the time and patience you could do longer flights.

If you want a chillaxing game where you lean back to enjoy the flight but also like a bit of adventure with the controls during rough weather or night time flying, if you enjoy a sense of achievement, then get this, also if you have friends and play multiplayer then it takes it to another level, you wont have kids playing this

So far its getting better and better, so im pretty sure there lots to come.

Updates has further improved this sim, VR is also possible, Ive also collected many aircraft for free, just as good as paid ones, from jetliners to turbo props to smaller aircraft, helos too, stay away from the boats though.",1600560441,1700715661,True,1,2,0.461946368217468262,0,True,False,False

I also think the simulated aerodynamics are off. The plane is prone to lurching more than seems accurate, for example.

- incredible graphics
- very high realism in most details (YouTube videos from actual pilots confirm the degree)
- Weather system / Clouds quality is absolutely next generation level
- You can also choose live weather / wind / conditions .. which is fantastic !
- You see other pilots and their planes (collision with planes/cars/trucks is disabled, so, not stressful when people just ignore the rules)
- Great payware and study level aircraft available through the marketplace and 3rd party stores.
- Authentic simulation of ATC radio communication Airport/Tower... you even have ground services where you request refuelling or a push back for your plane..

Pro-verdict: 100% the most advanced, beautiful and immersive Flight Simulator today for PC
- we've got a modding community already working on new planes / buildings / airports / landscapes and even
bug fixes.

Con:
- It's not finished (Many elements in the cockpit of bigger jets don't work yet)
- The map still needs a lot of fixes/improvements, but since we're talking about the entire earth -> it is already amazing and awesome.. just, not finished. So, not a bad ""con"".
- Biggest complaint -> Autopilot. The autopilot for the jets has horrible bugs, and can crash your plane easily.
It's far from reliable ! More details in below in the dev-section.
- you'll need a high-end PC for getting awesome graphics with good FPS, but that's logically to be expected ;-)

Neutral:
- Many big buildings all over the world are missing, since that's enormous work to be done, and much of it will be added later and / or can be bought from community modders.

Verdict:
In my opinion, if you can live with not trusting the autopilot yet and wanna learn and enjoy, I recommend you buy. The game is already awesome.",1700609171,1700609171,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I picked the Premium Deluxe Edition up in the lunar sale at 20% off which at ¬£90 was still a gamble for me. 
 
I haven't played an MSFS title since 2002/2003 but knew roughly what to expect in terms of realism, detail and live weather but I was a bit hesitant that it wouldnt be as exciting for me as DCS World. But that's the point. It's like comparing Gran Turismo to Euro Truck Simulator. Two totally different sims with different feels, objectives and experiences. But I'll get to that later.  
 
The install is HEAVY! Take ZERO notice of the recommended specs on the store page! By the time you've installed the game and any updates and free DLC, you're looking at 294GB! Roughly the same as my DCS World install. As I didn't have that kind of space free on my C: drive (SSD), I had to uninstall few other games on my D: HDD drive and install it there. I may have to purchase a portable SSD to keep both simulators on in the near future. Another thing about the install process is that it took me about 4 hours to download and install completely. I think this ate into my Steam ""trial period"" time so if I wanted a refund, I would have had problems. Luckily, I didn't need one.  
 
The first thing that struck me was the menu and options screen layout along with the music. The hangar option is a nice touch too. It reminds me of the Gran Turismo showrooms as do the challenges. I also liked the world map where you create your flight routes. If you turn on real clouds you can see the real-world cloud cover. And by zooming right in, you can actually see them move! This also enables you to set up a flight right where you may see a real-world weather event taking place such as a hurricane. Personally I thought that was a nice touch.  
 
The level of detail is quite nice if not 100% perfect when it comes to generating buildings in cities. Again, the live weather is pretty cool but that technology has been around since MSFS2002 so I wasn't as impressed as a newbie to the series might be. The game itself I find quite relaxing. I like to setup up long haul flights, leave the autopilot on and the dull droning of the engines can be very relaxing in the back ground when I'm sleeping, reading or streaming on another device until I get the call to begin decent.  
 
Nearly two years after release, this game STILL has a lot of bugs. Issues with systems on individual aircraft, atc issues, achievements not unlocking, AI (or lack thereof) I'd be here all day if I listed them all. The game has been out for nearly 2 years and has been in development for years before that. So why is there still so many problems? Each new patch/update seems to open up more problems too. Asobo and Microsoft really need to get on top of this. Reporting bugs via the site just gets marked ""bug solved"" which I've found out since just means it's been noted. No I'm not joking. Asobo could learn a thing or two from Eagle Dynamics on how to engage with their fan base on the forums especially when it comes bugs, fixes and upcoming updates. There's non of that here from what I've seen. No communication whatsoever.  
 
So is it worth getting? If you're into sims then yes, go for it. Although I personally don't believe the benefits of the Premium Deluxe Edition justify the ¬£100+ price tag. If I had the choice again, I'd just get the standard edition. DCS World is a lot more technical mainly due to dealing with the various weapon systems and tactics etc. MSFS is basically keeping up with ATC and perfecting your landings. The autopilot does pretty much everything else. Unlike DCS you don't need a HOTAS to enjoy it or get the most out of it. A simple XBOX controller is suitable and will work just fine. Again unlike DCS World, you also don't need TrackIR to look around with. You're in a small cockpit and going at a slow pace therefore it's not a necessity.  
 
All in all, 7 out of 10 but don't shell out for the Premium Deluxe Edition whether it's in a sale or not. This game STILL has a lot of work to be done...",1645171944,1700598480,True,1,0,0.517045438289642334,0,True,False,False

There's everything an enthusiast for these kinds of games could be looking for in terms of simulation, but everything about the game remains fully open to casual gamers and novices. There are plenty of choices for how many assists you want and the amount of depth and consideration for accessibility makes me confident in saying that everyone can pick this game up and enjoy what it has to offer. You can play it comfortably with an Xbox controller with no issues.

Making your own fun is the best part of the game. My first flight had me flying in two remote locations across the arctic ocean just to see what would happen to the GPS when I crossed the top of the planet. I made my own fun ducking and weaving through clouds as I flew towards the sunrise on the other side of the planet, then trying to land on a remote landing strip despite a thick arctic cloud layer obstructing my vision.

The support is phenomenal, and despite the game's large size requirements, the decision to allow updates to be individually cherry-picked so you can improve the areas you fly most often - saving disk space wherever possible - is fantastic. I would love to see features like this in other large games. 
Flight models have been regularly improved for aircraft based on community feedback over the years when Asobo & Microsoft realized how much of a hardcore fanbase MSFS brought in compared to the casual audience, and the amount of free content provided to the game is outstanding even if you don't purchase the deluxe / premium deluxe versions. Asobo has worked with multiple major third-party addon creators to bring high-quality updates to the aircraft as well as entirely new planes, such as the free study-level A310, upcoming update to the A320, updates to the Garmin navigation systems to make them true-to-life, flight models and system quirks of aircraft including the Cessna Citation series aircraft, etc. Speaking both for myself and my grandfather, as both of us have been regular MSFS users since Flight Simulator 95, this is by far the best the series has ever been.

HOWEVER. The biggest drawback, and perhaps only truly major drawback to this game, is the launcher. The MSFS launcher is incredibly resource-heavy, eating up your CPU and GPU while open - and the launcher is the only method to download and update the game. You are only downloading the launcher when you purchase and install this product. 
The launcher is not fast at downloading either, capping out well below whatever your maximum download speed is. For those of you with download speeds in the gigabyte+ range, this is probably not an issue you'll notice or care about - but for anyone with slower, cheaper urban internet plans or rural internet connections, you will be stuck on that launcher for a very long time when installing or updating the game. All of this counts towards your game time as well, meaning you will lose the ability to refund the game just by installing it as you'll far surpass the 2 hour mark. The download is also prone to freezing and erroring out during peak download times, such as directly following a major content update - and fixing this often requires manual intervention and more headaches.

Essentially, you need to know this is a product you will enjoy BEFORE purchasing it if you know your internet will push you past the refund window. If you're a casual fan looking to get into flying, then you can't start in a better place than here - but just make sure you've done some research and know you won't want to refund it before jumping in.",1700335725,1700336264,True,1,1,0.441984027624130249,0,True,False,False

Steam thinks you're playing it while you're watching a progress bar. I have an ultra fast non-shared optical fibre connection and it took many hours to finish (not to mention the hdd space it takes, it's just ridiculous).

2nd thing is that it is just NOT for everyone. Basically if you know nothing about planes, you'll only get some few basic introduction tutorials that will get you into air and back in just 2 planes (+some basic flying techniques on the most basic plane). For the jet, there are literally just simplistic starting and landing tutorials, without much explanation why you are doing those things, and there are hundreds of controls in those planes, not to mention all the procedures. This is something that if you are hoping for (I was), you will be very disappointed.

3rd thing is the ""whole world available"" thing. If you are hoping that you will fly over your town or house, you will be very disappointed too. It is literally like flying over a flat google map image, with just reflections added to water + some houses converted into random 3D models (not matching reality in any way).

The game is also hard to master with an ordinary xbox controller, the joystick is just too sensitive. For me it was just not very fun because of this and in general I really regret buying this game, despite buying it on one of the biggest discounts that you can get in more than year of waiting. I could get (one and a half of) another, much more entertaining game that I'm hunting for (for a good price, I'm a patient guy and I already have more games than I can play) without any discount at all, since it offers a demo and I know that it's very good.

Having said that, I can recommend this game for pilots and hobbyists that know their stuff and are playing other plane simulators, because it probably is one of the best ones (if you don't mind financing Bill Gates and his ""philanthrophy"" of course üòâ). I'm saying ""probably"" because I have seen only a few and they were overwhelming for a beginner and had zero tutorials. You will most likely not care about the ground looking bad from close distance, you are used to worse than that, while from above everything looks perfect and the plane simulation is probably perfect (I can't judge) and most or all plane controls are functional (again, didn't test that much as I don't know what is for what). You may be slightly annoyed with the game and mission loading times though so be prepared mentally.

PS:
Also I had a bug that I couldn't select any starting location or aircraft, apart from the one I selected the very fist time - it was just loading that setup every single time later. I don't know if they fixed it yet (it's loading too long for me to check that now), but in case you get it, I found online that it's because of non-English character in Windows user name, so you need to create a whole new Windows account and switch to it every time you want to play this game, if you want to pick starting locations rather than playing tutorials or any fixed missions.",1700331253,1700331253,False,197,19,0.74109041690826416,19,True,False,False

Introduction:

In the realm of flight simulation, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 stands as a groundbreaking testament to the technological advancements in the gaming industry. Developed by Asobo Studio and published by Xbox Game Studios, this latest installment in the long-running series has raised the bar for realism, graphics, and overall immersive gameplay. Released in August 2020, Microsoft Flight Simulator (MSFS) has since become a benchmark for flight simulation enthusiasts and casual gamers alike.

Graphics and Visual Realism:

One of the standout features of Microsoft Flight Simulator is its jaw-dropping visuals. Powered by Microsoft's Azure cloud technology, the game utilizes real-time data to recreate the Earth in exquisite detail. From the sprawling cities to the remote mountain ranges, the level of realism is unparalleled. The use of high-resolution satellite imagery and 3D photogrammetry creates a visually stunning world that mirrors our own.

The dynamic weather system adds another layer of realism to the experience. Pilots will encounter realistic weather conditions, including rain, snow, thunderstorms, and even the Northern Lights. The attention to detail in the depiction of weather patterns contributes significantly to the overall immersion, making each flight a unique and challenging experience.

Aircraft Selection and Realism:

Microsoft Flight Simulator boasts an extensive fleet of aircraft, ranging from small propeller planes to large commercial jets. Each aircraft is meticulously recreated, with realistic flight dynamics and cockpit details. Whether you're a seasoned pilot or a newcomer to aviation, the simulator offers a range of difficulty settings to cater to all skill levels.

The game's attention to realism extends to the physics of flight. Aerodynamics, engine behavior, and even the impact of different weights on the aircraft are accurately modeled. This level of detail provides a learning curve for beginners while offering a rewarding experience for experienced virtual aviators. The simulator's commitment to authenticity is evident in the fact that real-world pilots have praised its accuracy in replicating the feeling of flying.

World Exploration and Navigation:

Microsoft Flight Simulator is not just about flying; it's about exploring the world from a unique perspective. The game features a comprehensive map that allows players to choose their departure and arrival points from virtually any location on Earth. The ability to fly over famous landmarks, explore remote areas, and witness breathtaking landscapes makes each flight a captivating journey.

For those who prefer a more structured experience, the simulator includes a variety of pre-planned flights and landing challenges. These range from short scenic routes to more complex cross-country flights. The inclusion of live air traffic, based on real-world data, further enhances the sense of immersion and realism, making each flight feel like a small part of a much larger aviation ecosystem.

User Interface and Accessibility:

While the level of detail in Microsoft Flight Simulator is awe-inspiring, the user interface remains intuitive and accessible. The game offers a range of control options, from simplified setups for beginners to advanced configurations for those using flight simulation hardware. The menus are well-organized, and the on-screen tooltips provide helpful information for players of all experience levels.

The simulator also benefits from an active and supportive community. Online forums, tutorials, and user-created content contribute to a wealth of resources for those seeking to enhance their experience or troubleshoot any issues. Microsoft's commitment to ongoing updates and improvements has resulted in a responsive development team that addresses user feedback and continually refines the simulator.

Multiplayer Experience:

Microsoft Flight Simulator introduces a robust multiplayer component, allowing pilots to share the skies with friends or other players from around the world. This adds a social dimension to the simulation, as users can coordinate flights, explore together, or engage in more competitive activities such as aerobatic challenges. The seamless integration of multiplayer enhances the overall experience, fostering a sense of community among virtual aviators.

Performance and System Requirements:

Given the breathtaking visuals and the scale of the simulated world, Microsoft Flight Simulator demands a powerful gaming rig. While the game is optimized for a wide range of hardware, users with mid-tier or higher systems will fully appreciate the visual fidelity and smooth performance. The simulator's ability to scale across various configurations ensures accessibility for a broad audience, but those with top-tier setups will enjoy the most immersive experience.

Conclusion:

Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 sets a new standard for realism and immersion in the world of flight simulation. Its stunning visuals, extensive aircraft selection, realistic physics, and the ability to explore the entire globe make it a must-play for aviation enthusiasts and gamers alike. The simulator's accessibility and commitment to ongoing updates ensure that it will continue to be a benchmark for the genre in the years to come. Whether you're a seasoned pilot or someone with a curiosity for the skies, Microsoft Flight Simulator opens up a world of aviation like never before, inviting players to soar to new heights in the most realistic virtual skies ever created.

3 Years after release, and their CDN (Which i assume is Microsoft Azure) still fails to deliver anything beyond 1990s average speeds. I mean it's literally at 2.5 mbps most of the time. Yes, 300 KiB per second for 160 GiB! They also removed ANY progress indicator that works. The only thing you get is a) ads, and b) a static ""progress bar"" that starts at 90% and doesn't move after that.

I expect them to continue this trend of anti-excellence with their future products.

Maybe I'll update with some more information after the game finishes to download in 6 days.

I tried refunding it but I already had too many hours on it (bcs Steam counts game hours during downloading or installing the game, which is soo stupid).

Offer an amazing experience visually flying.  And objectively it does all three equally well.  So when I setup my yoke, throttle, fire up the sim, Im expecting the game to either update or crash the MAJORITY of the time.  If its updates, they should or could even add it as a dlc called ""Update Simulator"", because the amount of time spent updating vs doing anything else is amazing.  Id honestly say its 1/5 of the time spent has been doing updates.  Now if I manage to get into a flight, I fly fingers crossed the entire time as its a 50/50 if the sim will crash.  Theres no reason, no pattern, nothing that I could point to and say thats whats causing it to crash as it does it all the time.  My drivers are updated, the sim makes sure its updated, I have no clue.  I would love to say that the time that it does work makes up for the rest, but the time that it works, without having an update, and not crashing is so little I find it hard to want to get frustrated with updates and crashing all of the time on a sim ive spent over $100 on the sim itself, and nearly $1000 on hotas and yokes.  Ive spent thousands of hours on fsx and waited patiently for a long time for this to come out, this is such a disappointment because it does give a taste of how good it could be if it would just be stable, Id be ok with updates if it was stable.

Moreover, after doing some online research I found that Microsoft kept the files in a hidden folder.

Microsoft does this so that it holds priority space if I ever want to reinstall Flight Sim again. However, last time I checked I own my computer not Microsoft. Needles to say I didn't appreciate the difficulty to remove or find the hidden files of Flight Sim!

It's a crazy complicated game, but the QA on this game which is now 2 years old is abysmal and super disappointing when I went all in for the top version of the game.

And here I was hoping for lots of hours to enjoy this with my new RTX 4080, but I guess I clearly set my expectations too high for this simulator.

When the simulator isn't a crash simulator, it's enjoyable but it's gotten to the point where I can't even do anything for 5 or more minutes without the sim just dying. Just scrolling on the world map? CTD. Loading in and in the middle of takeoff? CTD. Reaching cruising altitude? CTD. Keep in mind, I tried everything I could whether it was booting in safe mode, updating all my drivers, going through all my community files, rolling back the graphics driver etc. etc.

They have all had their bugs, but this one may be the most annoying.    I don't have performance issues, or any complaints about visuals, textures or anything like that.  All of that is fantastic.  It's some basic functions that completely ruin the experience.  

-ATC will fly you into terrain.  If flying IFR into an airport around mountains, follow your planned altitudes, not ATC. 
-ATC voice goes silent
-ATC sometimes goes off the rails and keeps assigning new altitudes, over and over and over. This usually happens at the worst possible time.   Everything is smooth, you‚Äôre stabilized and picking up the localizer, waiting for your handoff, and you get ATC yelling at you to go to 4700, no 4400, no 3000, now back to 5600, no go to 3000, 3400.... no go to 8000.   ABSOLUTELY MADDENING.  
-ATC gets stuck on ATIS, then when you swap to COM2, it also gets stuck. 
-Missed approach?  Yeh, ATC says climb back up to your cruising altitude. 
-ATC vectors? useless.  Like they just give you a random vector.  
-Flight planner... sucks, for lack of a better word.  1 out of 3 flights, after setting everything up to start cold and dark... it starts me hot, on the runway.  
-Set altitude for a waypoint?  Nope, Pilots don't do that, according to MSFS. 
-You landed, and want to take off again?  Radio voices go silent... have to quit to desktop and restart the sim.  
-Airport personnel are a nice touch, but they are suicidal.  They will walk right through your prop.  I feel like there should be a stat in the game for how many poor airport workers have casually strolled right into your propeller.  If they are not gonna fix this, then they should at least model the gore and make it realistic.  
-Airport vehicles are cool, but always doing silly things.  I've never sat in traffic behind 12 cars on a real taxyway before.  Not really a big deal because you can turn these off if you want to.   Has real potential, but needs work and could be annoying.  

I want to recommend it, but how can a company with so much money behind them still after ALL THESE YEARS not get this right?  They nailed almost everything else.  The visuals are fantastic, virtual models beautiful, weather is awesome, good flight dynamics (at least for turboprops and piston aircraft).  If they at least fix this maddening ATC and radio problem, then I will gladly change my mind.  Till then, I cant recommend it unless you just want to fly around and look at pretty stuff. 

But did I spend enough time in it?  168 hours, multiple updates (including a major one) and... it's like they are doing this to annoy people.  

Oh, but it's the adons?  Did you disable the.... No, shut up, I have NO adons, just the stock game.  I'm in IT, I tried everything, it's not my system.  


EDIT:  Just as I was gonna change my review and recommend the sim, I get a disconnect while on final after an 1 hour flight.   Naturally, an un-clickable prompt pops up, hides the cursor, and I watch my airplane spiral towards the ground.  Of course, it un-locks 2 seconds before impact.   

I see there have been a ton of scenery and aircraft systems updates lately.  All of that is great, but USELESS when things like this happen.  Fix the ATC and random nonsense like this.  No reason this should happen.

Edit: okay turns out i had bad memory, which was corrupting files. The download sucks still and should be outside game imo.

I think this flight simulator definitely deserves a bit of praise, not only for reinventing how the entire world appears with mere coding and graphical design in a videogame, but for being one of the most widely successful re-entries done by a company in videogame history. I really enjoy flying over major cities and being able to actually see what they generally look like with the help of ground imagery. I salute Microsoft for really putting in the effort and re-innovation, in such a beloved series for aviation enthusiasts like myself. 

However, I will say this. The physics introduced by this engine is rather self-limiting, as well as the extreme lack of cross-compatibility with its predecessors. The fact that Microsoft has just released plans for a 2024 edition (around the time of this update) also irks me. The lack of freeware addons doesn't help either, and I don't like the long re-installation process and painful lag on even newer systems.

Those are just a few quips about this program. I still recommend that you play it, especially for the newer enthusiasts.",1637967549,1699665104,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

IMO this needs to be either PC or Xbox, not both. Quality control for PC seems to have suffered. (Maybe for Xbox as well, but I run this on my PC.)
Some of the lessons/tutorials appear to start scoring before it is explained what you need to do. 
Refund options seem to be non existant for in game Market. I bought the KODIAK 100 and it has horrible cockpit display glare during daytime. I tried all I could come up with, adjusting bright, contrast, gamma. Removing Eye adjust in the config. Even put in a support ticket for a refund for the KODIAK 100 and a day later still no support response. 
https://steamcommunity.com/app/1250410/discussions/0/3279192092216029483/
I bought the KODIAK 100 to fly bush plane type flights in Papua New Guinea, sadly this is not very possible as the displays are mostly seen best at night, and PNG grass strips in mountains don't have runway lights!

This MSFS GOTY (2020) has possibilities, but it also has many glitches, issues, and problems. Trim at times is devil possessed. Several times now after a graphics adjustment, the elevator trim is FULL up.
Lastly, I wish another company would make a flight sim like this, because I dislike supporting anything to do with insane B.G.

The pro's:
I do like the world map setup.
I do like accuracy of the roads and building (real world) placement which seems 90% accurate. Although the actual buildings are not real world replica's
The terrain elevation seems very accurate.

Currently, VR on a reverb G2 is nearly unusable from render micro-stutters that inexplicably, only seem to affect the cockpit. Everything outside the window renders just fine. Looks really nice on three monitors as long as you don't ask it to do anything complicated like VR. 

If you've got a slow internet connection, this sim is going to be a massive pain. I only average about 2.5M down, and so far this has twice refused to recognize the install directory and re-download the whole thing. One of those times i only had the hard drive it was on unplugged for a few hours. literally no changes. A lot of new games pull stuff like this and it's infuriating. There aren't even any installer options anymore. Fix your installer... and your VR.

Dropping my recommendation. Even with a faster internet connection it still has update issues they haven't fixed. They've got another one coming out in the ""2024"" because they've decided they cant do anymore with the codebase in this one.... only like 3 years after releasing.

Would i recommend buying msfs2020 in 2022? 
Yes! The game is starting to look more and more like a good sim instead of a game (if you want to)
With the recent add-ons of GSX, PMDG and fenix we got some great aircraft as well as ground handling. Combine that with Vatsim and you can make it quite realistic. Then if you just want to chill and relax in a fighter jet, thats also possible!

Now if you are willing to spend your money and want the best realism possible, then i suggest looking into Xplane11 or P3D as these simulators have many addons that can make the sim study worthy. I do believe that you can eventually achieve that in msfs too. 

Update* 
Should I Recommend Purchasing Microsoft Flight Simulator in 2023?

As I've mentioned before, Microsoft Flight Simulator (MSFS) has seen significant development, with numerous third-party companies contributing scenery, tools, and aircraft. When you factor in the immersive VATSIM experience, it truly becomes an exceptional flight simulator. It's worth noting that MSFS 2024 has been announced, so if your primary goal is casual gaming for fun, I wouldn't necessarily recommend buying MSFS at this point. However, if you're interested in creating an ultra-realistic flight environment, the good news is that many of the add-ons available for MSFS can likely be adapted for MSFS 2024, so no reason to wait!",1663620056,1699458700,True,9,0,0.63579171895980835,0,True,False,False

Why does my Cessna 152 need automatic push back from a ramp? Why is it so hard to find out if I can even turn this off?? So annoyed with this thing.
I regret paying for this.

Update a year later: Thought I'd give it another try... Not much has changed, except now I'm constantly crashing with no errors to my desktop. Simulator just freezes for a second and then closes. Can't even run this thing!!! Waste of money.

When you launch it after this crash, it gives you a warning that blaims it on 3rd party content, out of date content, or 3rd party drivers. I have no 3rd party content installed, it is up to date, and I'm using the latest drivers. Nice way to try to point the finger elsewhere. Just peeves me off.

Uninstalled yet again and still regret paying for this.

Update May 2022... Yup, it still crashes to desktop with no error messages moments after starting flying. The *VAST MAJORITY* of my played hours are just DOWNLOADING this 123gb steaming pile of excrement. 

STAY AWAY. DO NOT BUY. They can't even fix an issue that has been plaguing this thing since release. I regret every having bought this pile....

The simulator looks amazing, truly unique and beautiful. However one of the few positive points to it. Do not buy the premium deluxe version, as most of the time the perks won't even show up. The simulator already takes up 450gb of space, and nearly every time I open it I have a mandatory 5-10gb update for some region that I will likely never even visit. Loading times are painfully long, and any add-on aircraft are nothing short of a nightmare to install. The simulator crashes easily, and frequently resets your controls, which will get very annoying very quickly. Multiplayer can be fun at first, but it will quickly become a chore to use as you notice a large number of very annoying players who have no regard to realism or rules.

The simulator is mainly focused to GA and light aircraft. The missions section is quite fun, however after spending hours trying to get an A in all of them, it can be quite dissapointing to come back the next day to see that all the progress has been undone. 

The UI is somewhat decent.

A strong point of the simulator is its flexibility in flight. For example, you can change the weather in any way you want mid-flight, without any loading times, at the risk of the simulator crashing of course.

Overall, it is not a simulator worth spending 120 Euros on for the premium deluxe version. Standard might be a little more worth the money, if you have the patience for the simulator. If one is buying a simulator to help learn flight physics, you'd be better off buying XPlane, however if you just want beautiful graphics, this Microsoft Flight Simulator is well... the best one out there, graphically speaking.",1647899297,1699175302,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Well, the VR controls are not usable, and the default settings are awful.
I just wanted to try to chill out in a nice VR demo flight before deciding whether or not i wanted to invest some time into properly learning how to flight. It was hell: couldn't even take off before 20 minutes, there were some horrible green wind vector lines all around making the view awful, the controls needed a mix of keyboard, regular controller, and VR controllers, because you actually can't do much from the VR controllers alone (like switching from outside to cockpit view requires to take of the headset and reach to your regular controller).
I could finally fly over New York for a few minutes, well what's left of NY: it looked like a post apocalyptic world, with low poly and messy textures everywhere. They don't show you that in the ads.
Long story short, it took me about 30 minutes to decide it wasn't for me. No problem, refund is made for that, right ?
Well, that was when the game hit me with a last punch: the bandwidth management is so poor that it took me about 2 hours and a half to download the 125 Gb of mandatory content (and i have a very high bandwidth), so when i decided to get a refund after 30 min of actual ""playing"", i already had 3+ hours of playtime.

As expected with a flight sim, a solid rig is needed, but settings are in-depth which helps to fine tune for your rig. Unfortunately, this is one of the reasons why MS Flight Sim can also be a bit buggy at times, it's a sim with so many modes, settings and possibilities, that it's rare to not run into some issues. Less bugs and more stability would be my biggest wish for improvements. One of my new highlights is the VR mode, it's just such a great use of VR to make you feel like you're actually in the cockpit, and I even notice it helps me do better in some of the landing challenges because I can look around better. Amazing for VR if you have a great setup! (I'm using a Quest 2 with Virtual Desktop + Steam VR to connect via WiFi to my PC which is in mobile hotspot mode, my specs are 4070Ti with a 7950X3D.

The aircraft are really high quality but some of the paid mods are pretty bad like the 737 max 8, that was really low quality, the list goes on with ""scam"" mods but besides that this is really good.

2023 updated review:
Microsoft flight simulator is still one of the best flight simulators even with the new release of x plane 12, since the last review I made on this sim the physics have definitely been revised and do feel much better than before, since i've recently started flying in real life this is a great tool to practice my real circuits I do in real life. I have to say the gyroscopic precession is simulated quite well in propellor aircraft and you can definitely feel the weight when flying the aircraft. Overall this sim has aged beautifully in recent years and has been maintained extremely well by asobo with bug fixes and new dlcs, and also the mods have taken a big step up from the last review like the pmdg 737 or fenix a320. and if your heavily interested in having an immersive experience on msfs (or any other flight sim) I highly recommend VATSIM.

I originally tried MSFS20 on gampass on release back in 2020, and now after 3 years, it is about to take the spot of the most played game in my library.

Some people are against calling MSFS a game as it is literally a simulation of Earth and it's atmosphere in which you can fly nearly any type of aircraft. Looking at previous entries of the series and other flight sims, I would agree with this sentiment. However Asobo have provided a wide array of activities and challenges including bush trips, landing challenges and even Top Gun themed missions including carrier landings. MSFS does not have to be seen as a pure simulator and can be thoroughly enjoyed as an absolute novice who has never touched a sim and wants to treat it as an arcade-like flying game. MSFS can absolutely be enjoyed as a game through and through, or it can help you learn how to pilot real aircraft and simulate accurate procedures undertaken by real-world airlines.

Over 3 years, MSFS has developed a large abundance of downloadable content, both free and paid, and both official and third-party. All of the official content and a large portion of the third-party content can be accessed through the ingame store. Flight sim addons appear to have been a vital aspect of flight simulation for the better part of 3 decades, and the variety of types of addons and their varying quality is extremely vast. Read and watch reviews before purchasing addons, especially the more expensive ones like ""study-level"" aircraft.

I would not consider addons as necessarily essential to MSFS however, but like most moddable games, they can dramatically enhance your experience. When starting out with MSFS, especially as an absolute novice like I was, the standard aircraft and scenery is fantastic to get started with, I do highly recommend downloading all the free world updates by Asobo but they will take up a good chunk of drive space.

MSFS is difficult to review as game due to the nature of the beast, but as I've said MSFS is a thoroughly enjoyable game, but it is so much more than a game. For me, it was a step into a new hobby and a great introduction to the wonder of flight, and believe me when I say it is a truly wonderful experience.

What both amplifies and assembles this experience is the unparalleled visuals and presentation of the aircraft and planet. MSFS is without a doubt the most impressive digital interactive experience I have ever seen. The out of the box beauty and realism MSFS provides is absolutely unheard of in the long history of flight sims. Other flight sims have required hundreds of dollars of addons to even come close to recreating MSFS's visual glory. Other sims like XPlane are said to have better physics, but if you are new to flight simming, I would definitely recommend this over any of the others. If you are an experienced simmer, im surprised you're still reading this review.

If you have even the slightest interest or even just want to see what it would be like to fly a Pelican from Halo through Manhattan (yes, you read that right), do yourself a favour and get a taste of the virtual skies. Flying became an addictive and rewarding experience very quickly. There is something so gratifying about getting clean landings, from 747s to Cessna 152s and the landing challenges allow you to go after that buzz over and over again with ease. For me, replicating airliner procedures from start to finish has become my favourite thing to do in MSFS, while the game may not teach you how to necessarily do those procedures by itself, it provides the perfect platform to learn how to do so. Bush trips and general aviation may totally be your buzz on the other hand. No matter which way you decide to play, MSFS can be an extremely satisfying, rewarding, challenging or relaxing experience. Its what ever you make of it, in MSFS the sky truly is the limit, so to speak.

Only thing people should keep in mind is that it has no seasons, and microsoft still hasn't released their weather API, so you're stuck with the default live weather system. 

Microsoft's xbox CDN network can be hit or miss depending on your location and ISP, meaning you'll get very slow speeds irrespective of your data limit. There is a list of ""solutions"" on the msfs support page, but that is hit or miss.

Most airports, if bought from the MSFS marketplace, have encrypted files, so external add-ons like LittleNavMap or MakeRwys won't be able to read them.

 (My original review) 


STOLEN WONDERS OF THE WORLD
(evil Bill Gates have stollen the ""wonders"" of the World)


 - BROKEN INSTALL - BROKEN GAME

 We started with the wrong feet. The first day, the install was broken

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2201451793

 One hour later, ""1%"" download (""154 MiB"")

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2201502487

 Took me 12 hours of tension to install the 100 GB.


- Couple of years later, the game installer its still the same CR*P

 With each single Update, it will work... or it will CRASH. 

 its a very commun issue, and when it fails, you just CANT RUN/PLAY THE GAME. 

- the game installer will loop forever, no matter what, and game will never start. 

 You can see my profile: I have more than 300 games, and Microsoft Flight Sim its the ONLY GAME with this FATAL issue. It may be the worst istaller I ever seen.

 Gooble thss issue. You may find thousands of people with the same problem.

 So you will have to spend HOURS, DAYS, or WEEKs trying to find a solution on the web.

 Sounds incredible. But Microsoft already took tyour money, and they dont care.
 I mean, this bug its still there more tha 2 years after release.


 UPDATE OCTOBER 2022: 

 The game crashed again while updating. Now ITS IMPOSSIBLE TO UPDATE. IMPOSSIBLE TO INSTALL AND IMPOSSIBLE TO RUN.

- Even a full new install, in a different drive, its not working. 


 ****
 
""check integrity"" worked once.  I was forced to launch maybe 15 times or more, in a long start-download-crash-verify, start-download, crash,  veryfi, etc., etc. etc.

Now i just CANT play the game, cause it


 THE SIM

- When it runs, the sim is nice, and -somes times- beauty. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2204850143

 But its light and unfinished.

- In some planes, 50% of the cockpit are ""not interactive"".
 You cant even start many planes from the cockpit.

So you get in your virtual cockpit, clicking ""real"" instruments with your mouse like a champ... you feel the mouse its your finger... and its like you are IN the real plane... 

 But, then, you have to find wich keyboard-key actually start the plane, cause there is no intercative button to start it in the cockpit.  

- DCS give you a much more realistic and IMMERSIVE experience, with 99% clickable cockpits, in very complex weapons systems. 

 In SIMPLE civil prop planes, I do not accept less than that.
 

 MATHIAS RUST's FURY

 One of the most unforgetable fllights in history, was the flight of Mathias Rust.

 In december 1987 (Cold War), when he was only 19 years old, Mathias Rust took his Cessna 172, and flew from the Western Germany Republic, to the capital and heart of the comunist Soviet Union.

 The boy was lucky enough to survive the most terrific AAA defences of the World, and landed his Cessna in the very Red Square of Moscow, steps away from the Kremlin and the Saint Bassilic Cathedral. 

- In Microsoft Flight Sim, Mathias Rust will never be able to find the Red Square, because many of the most beautiful and iconic buildings of the World, just werent there. 

- The Saint Basil`s Cathedral, and the State Musseum of History are just ugly stains on the 2D ground. And the Red Square of Moscow looks like a cold war game.

 https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2202143965

 And will remain like stains, unless, you pay for them...


 STOLEN WONDERS of the WORLD

- We buy MFS  because they promess us the most realistic simulation of the Earth.
 (Otherwise, we will be flying DCS, X-Plane 11, or anything else)

 But you will notice that HUNDREDS of the MOST iconic places on the Earth, just wasnt there. 

- Yes, you can fly over the Pyramids of Ghiza.
 But Abu Simbel temples aren there. They have been deintegrated, and now are stains on the ground.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2202142936

 Many other ""wonders"" of the World have been stolen.

 Also, many trees have been described as ""horrible obelisks"".  

-  In Microsoft Flight Sim, the Evil Bill Gates have stollen the ""wonders"" of the World. And he wants your money to take them back.

- I not against DLCs, I have hundreds of them.
 I really like them when designers give you something new.
 When they expand the universe.


 Want some cool helicopters? OK, Pay. 
 Want hydroplanes? Pay. 
 Want some vintage planes? Pay....

- But I have paid Premium Deluxe Flight Sim, and I dont want to be extorted for BASIC content.

- I want my Saint Basil's Cathedral in the Red Square, and I want it without any aditional payment. Because its the most ICONIC and recognizable building of Russia, and they MUST be there.

- Make a list of the 10 most iconic places of each country. This 10 buildings must be there.


 - Please, helpme making the list of Stolen ""Wonders"" of the World.

 By now, it inlcudes:

 Abu Sinbel temples 
 State Musseum of History (Moscow)
 Saint Basils Cathedral (Moscow)
 South Beach palm trees
 Buenos Aires Obelisk
 etc.. etc. etc..

 Which is your favourite stolen bulding from MFS 2020 ?

Ok so it tooks me a while to figure out what was happening because I though I was the one doing something wrong or not understanding.

The bug is simple but game breaking. I recently found out that it's there since 3 years. So you make a flight plan for your flight. Then you fly but at some point you will save to resume later. Once you load your flight back, you COMPLETELY lose your flight plan you made for your flight and you can't have it back.

So if you don't want to lose your fight plan, you can't leave your flight...

In my opinion Steam should not allow such garbage. It doesn't install from the Steam client, just downloads Microsoft's installer. Initially I couldn't even start the install. It just said not enough disk space with no amount needed. Had to keep guessing on how much space to free up and blindly delete stuff. I don't think you can even get a refund because the installer counts as hours played and took half a day to download the 150GB+. At one point during the download I had to restart the computer and couldn't continue install.

I tried to launch the game, and it kept crashing on launch. I went to verify integrity of files, and it passed. But I now have to download a 125 GB update just to play this game?  I swear this is the most frustrating game I ever purchased on steam. Let me defer upgrades, if you don't at least provide a high bandwidth for the download.  I have almost '300 hours' playing this game; most of those hours are downloading updates.  Most people have jobs and want to play on Friday night or the weekend, but everytime I do, I have to wait several hours to download an update that likely provides nothing substantial to the game. FSX was by far a much better developed game; I hope they go back to those developers for the next version of MSFS.

Update one July 28 2021.  They released a mandatory update.  After this update, the game no longer works in VR, it will crash within 10 minutes.  This is been documented on Reddit and Steam forums.  The update was mandatory, and broke the game.  This has to be the worst game I have every purchased on Steam, and given the fairly high price, I feel ripped off.  The game worked before the update, and now it doesn't work.

The installer is forever frustrating. I first tied with XBOX app on windows 10, it failed to recognize my harddrive. There was a fix posted on microsoft website, but it 404s. I then installed through steam, but the download is not through stream, but through the app itself. You are forced to sign into a Microsoft account. I have 2 computers, my desktop and laptop, you can only download the game files on one computer at a time. So, if the download takes, say 8 hours, and you have 2 computers, you can't play the game during the 8 hour span that your second computer downloads the game. I swear Microsoft is making it so people will pirate this game.  I'm on an actual 400 Mbps connection, as per speedtest data on the advertised 1Gbps connection, 3 hours in I'm only 72% downloaded.  MS should have let steam handle the downloads.  For the price premium, this is unacceptable, if you work a normal job, you will spend all your free time just installing this game.  I don't see why I can't download this game on 2 computers at once, from the same IP address nonetheless.

Asobo incompetence knows no bounds. this game will be broken forever. 

Update Jan 2022. Now the mouse and keyboard  via blutoothdo not work after update. Asobo are clowns. Why so upset? imagine paying over $100 for a game that works 40% of the time then no refund after 5 hours of playing so you are stuck with a flawed product that you pay for. Only the software companies can get away with this, imagine buying a car that only starts 40% of the time but cannot return because already drove 100 miles, we as consumers would be outraged  but for some reason we tolerate it from companies like MS and Asobo that flat out take our money knowing they selling flawed product and then have endless updates that may or may not work. 

Original review - I bought the premium version. complete rip off for a broken game. Bugs galore. Auto pilot is crazy buggy, sometimes takes over and tries to kill you, for example, when you land and taxi to gate the plane takes over and crashes you even if AI  and auto pilot off this happens 40% of the time also Auto thrust turns itself on during flight so if you turn off then decent it will turn on again without you knowing, wow this is not a sim it is a broken mess. Game crashes 40% of time, nothing like almost finishing a 30 minute flight for it to crash and lose all your progress. The save function is useless, it does not save point in time you save it, it just puts you close to beginning of the flight so you lose most progress.  Turning off planes to log your flight is a buggy mess, sometimes the plane will be completely shut down but does not log progress so then after 20 min finding the right button to shut down only to discover had to press twice because of bug. Sometimes plane will shut down but fails to log progress  so you lose  flight time because would not log it so imagine flying an hr and losing all progress because of the bugs. 

The tutorials are useless and frustrating, for example the trim tutorial is the worst tutorial in gaming history, no matter what you do it will not trim. Trim is broken in this game, just read forums from real pilots.  Trim is one of the important aspects of flight and is garbage in this game.   I have a I9, 3080 GPU, 32GB ram, 900mbs internet and it still crashes and performance dips in large cities. Avg 40FPS. So  after 2 years they still cannot take advantage of all cpu cores. Wow, complete incompetence, let's develop a cpu intensive game but not utilize all cores, who hires these morons? Nd most cities missing key buildings. e.g. LA missing some iconic skyscrapers.

Take away the pretty visuals and great maps and you have just garbage game-play with game breaking bugs (restarts computer now when crashes) that are still not fixed after massive updates.  People so impressed with the visuals and maps that they overlook the actual gameplay and tolerate the bugs, crashes and  omissions .

I play it on a single screen, 3 screen setup, and in VR and it works well in each.  I have more invested into this game than any other I am currently playing, when you factor in DLCs and Honeycomb flight controls.  I bought the Premium Deluxe for the extra aircraft...   It is worth every penny.

VR - my first experience in VR was in an F-18 over the San Juan Isalnds of Washington State, USA.  The bubble canopy gives you alot of visibility, and the experience was in the top 3 gaming experiences of my life.  That was with Oculus 2, and it may be enough for me to consider an Oculus 3 at some point.

The only gripe I have is feeling a little betrayed by MS/Asobo in not necessarily sticking to their long term plans with FS2020 in favor of FS2024, but if they deliver improvements to the level that 2020 is over FS X, then I will throw my monty at them for that too.  

9.7 / 10  only because some places the AI went a little off the rails, but then the modding community is HUGE.  Free and paid, so you can really tailor your overall world, or flight to flight depending on how much load time you want to wait for (it definitely takes a bit).  Way cheaper than owning a plane from my experience with a humble 172G, and the landings are way less stressful at my home airport in the mountains in the game too -_-

But it has the dumbest download system I've ever seen for a game, and they've taken out the ability to fly with a mouse unless you download third party software as a mod. IFR flying is now extremely difficult too, as the autopilot and GPS now don't have pop up versions, so you need to move and zoom in your camera to the controls within the airplane and they're very finicky.

The good stuff - If you have played any other flight simulators, you'll know that none have ever had scenery of such quality. People paid hefty fees for 3rd party addons on other flight sims to get scenery packs that look worse than what you get out of the box with Flight Simulator's blackshark AI procedurally generated stuff. Sure, your house is just a flat texture and your garage was turned into a house, so what? It's a flight simulator, you shouldn't fly low enough to notice and it is still above and beyond anything else you can get.
The planes are wonderfully well done. The design details are fantastic and they do look and feel like their real counterparts and you even get fully simulated Garmin glass cockpits that are almost perfectly realistic. Some planes do need their engine performance/behaviour modified at this point and some are full of non functional switches, but even this is at a much lesser extent compared to default planes you would get with the old FSX.
Graphics need no introduction, you must have at least seen a youtube video that shows it's glory. From incredible lighting to visible fingerprints and scratches on glass surfaces, this is a real eye candy game like no other.
Sounds might have gotten under the radar but they are equally as impressive. Pushing or pulling on the yoke makes an eerily convincing sound you'd expect to hear in the real thing. Same goes for all knobs, levers and even buttons. Planes squeak and crackle when you put them into high G maneuvers, but my favorite sound showcase remains sitting in a cold and dark cessna caravan and playing with the prop and condition levers.

Now onto the bad stuff: If you're not willing to spend a lot of time just randomly flying flight plans you set for yourself or doing bush trips for the sake of it, there's very little content in terms of scenarios. Apart from a mediocre flight lesson section that only teaches you VFR basics, the only scenarios you can play at the moment are two bush trips and a bunch of landing challenges. If you want something more from your simulator, you might need to wait for a while.
The other glaring issue is that the game is currently not worth getting unless you have a proper flight yoke or stick controller. Big issue for me since I use my xbox 360 controller for flying. Not only is a Microsoft controller not being properly supported in a Microsoft's own game, but the development team seems to be struggling to add it in with the community waiting for more than a month now and no solution in sight. Until then one must learn to rely on flying without rudder pedals if you don't have a pair of combined axis ones.

All in all, FS is currently offering the best possible technological platform for civilian flight simulation, but with the little there is to offer on top of that platform and with urgent issues that need to be addressed, I think Flight Simulator feels like it was pushed out early and definitely still needs a lot of work. This is not uncommon and it is something I expected going in, but my concerns are currently directed at whether the team behind it will be able polish FS into what it could and should be, and the latest monthly update that not only failed to fix some crucial issues, but broke a couple of things as well has me worried. All things considered, I can't give it a thumbs up just yet.

EDIT: Many issues have been fixed including controller support I noted in my original review. The game is continually updated, there are still small glitches and some glaring unrealistic issues on the planes, but comparing this game to FSX that's to be expected with default planes. All in all now this has become a solid product.

EDIT: After many more hours ""played"" (many of these were spent waiting for the game to download and not actually playing) I can no longer support buying a product that works around half of the time. I have constantly had various issues and I can never start the game and expect to be able to play it. For a simulator that requires vast amount of content, around 100 GB, it's unacceptable that all the download happens through the game itself. It only takes a slowdown in the network connection to cause issues. I've had crashes upon the end of loading, infinite loading screens, crashes mid flight, etc. Now, knowing that they'll abandon this product, there is absolutely no point in buying it.",1600896382,1697745195,False,0,0,0.532967031002044678,0,True,False,False

I hate to say this, having been a Microsoft Flightsimulator fanboy sinds 1994, In fact MS flight simulator has helped me to become an airline pilot; this version however, is simply not worthy of that legacy.

FS2020 was released in an incomplete state. the Dev's know how to make a fantastic looking game, but lack any expertise to make it a true simulator. Even though the community provides them with the expertise via the forums, this is totally ignored in favour of adding more payware eye candy add-ons.

Their lack of aviation expertise is obvious to the experienced pilot, but an insult to anyone who is learning to fly. Where I could use MS'95 '95, 2000 and FSX to aid in my flight training, this game, especially with a keen eye on technical details, such as pressure altitude instruments, gyroscopic behaviour and engine management, is simply wrong. a student pilot might learn wrong things which would slow down their training progress instead of helping.

Then there is the total ignorance to legal customer rights. When a plane does not work (the fokker F.VIIa does not fly at all and the TF-104 starfighter can't fly supersonic) a refund from anything purchased on the the marketplace is not possible. For support you can go to the forum but there is no support from the dev-teams at all.

Breaking news:
Microsoft has recently announced their next simulator: MSFS2024

In fact this means that MS2020 was just an early access tech demo, sold at premium retail price. MS2024 would be the finished product, but you'll have to pay the full price again.

The waiting time for this to load is just unworkable. Time is too precious. Go outside and walk and hike or something and get some exercise rather than wait for MSFS to load.
The chase to produce the most amazing flight sim continues while the buying public continue to shell out money to try to keep their PC's able to run the bloody thing. After decades of playing flight sims, it's never changed and it's just boring now. I'm going out to get some fresh air and do something meaningful with my time.

If you want to just get home after a long day and boot up a sim to go fly someplace. Seriously look elsewhere. The amount of coding/problem-solving I've had to put into this sim to just get it to boot up to the main menu has been horrifying. (in a way it does accurately simulate the hundreds of hours trying to fix and maintain an aircraft vs the actual couple of hours you ACTUALLY fly)
I go through a loop. Sim won't boot. The entire weekend lost in troubleshooting, bug fixing, giving up, reinstalling, reinstalling ALL the addon content, Sim works fine (I let my guard down and think ""its not too bad"") close sim, sleep, try again a day or so later, Loop repeats.
MSFS 2020 is an abusive relationship. It sucks you in with the nice visuals and the promise of just being able to jump in and fly anywhere. 
To begin with the massive downloads took a literally 4 month to complete. At first it would consistently crash just downloading updates or game data. 
My initial impressions were not positive however as time has passed and it finally now runs I have to admit. It's grown on me. Mechanically speaking its much more stable now. Still has the occasional hiccup but overall fine. Bing maps gives the world a good sense of accuracy. If you know your local area well you can do flights purely navigating off landmarks. It ain't perfect but its only getting better. I am pretty sure there are ways of increasing the accuracy/visual fidelity of the maps but its dependent on the kind of flying you'll be doing. It is very easy to set up a flight from the thousands of airfields around the world and go anywhere your heart desires.
It does have decent tutorials to get you up and flying as well as challenges to attempt. However I've not tried those. Instead I've done my own thing. 
For example: My current self made challenge is somewhat inspired by the TV series Long way round by Ewan McGregor and Charley Booorman. Fly around the world, but not in a straight line or even directly. Instead, follow the major coastlines of the continents.

There are also a tonne more external mods you can add to it. (Realistic mapping/flight planning tools. Player driven ATC, upgraded visual mods, more planes.)  A good one to look at is Skypark. It is paid software however the add on makes the sim close in general idea to Euro truck sim. Getting paid game money to fly cargo on specific routes. 

The point I am getting at is that MSFS2020 is still an abusive and addictive relationship that keeps me coming back and spiralling deeper into the world of aviation.

Many people have the problem that downloads are extremely slow for MSFS, see the negative Steam reviews here and posts all over the internet. This seems to be because MS uses the Windows Update system for MSFS downloads, which is special and designed for slow, unobtrusive background downloads. My download speed was 1.5Mbit/s, that's really slow and not even 5% of my typical Steam download speed. Paired with the large game and the fact that you have to download the real content in-game, these speeds mean that people cannot even play before the end of the 2 h Steam refund window! For me the installation took 9 hours, I only discovered this fix afterwards when downloading the extra packs with more detailed maps. So if your download is slow, look at this thread: 

  https://forums.flightsimulator.com/t/slow-download-speed-megathread/427731

and follow the first solution, by XTCQuinn. It worked perfectly and instantly for me. I did it with the game running and downloading, without restarting it. As soon as I had typed the [i]netsh[/i] shell command (last part of the instructions in the post), the download speeds went to 100% of what my connection is capable of.

Review:

Apart from the Windows Store and Windows OS integration, this is a good game with two sides: an impressive world to fly in and great airplanes on the one side, various technical issues and bugs in the missions / activities as well as a lot of rough edges with ATC, ground services and menus on the other. 

There are 2 competitors (Xplane and Aerofly) which may be slightly better in a single, limited aspect each (VR performance, comms/ATC), but they are worse in most other aspects. The impressive graphics and detail of the world make FSFS the winner in my opinion, despite its flaws in some areas. It seems they have [i]every German airport in existence[/i] in this game. Even the tiny grass strip at the back of beyond of Lower Saxony where I once learned to fly is in there! The control you have over the weather at any point and the flight model are really good. Soaring in the Alps feels amazing, and so did my custom flight plan in a Cessna from Cuenca, Ecuador over the amazon to Macapa, Brazil. It was a dream come true. Virtually, but still.

Sadly, the game has quite some issues in other areas: I encountered various technical issues (cf. downloads above) and bugs quite early during my experience, e.g., in the glider training mission the tow plane sometimes does not climb and keeps on flying just meters above the tree tips and the village until it crashes you into the forest after 5 minutes. Also for me the 2nd Cessna tutorial in AZ just would not end after I did everything they asked, I had to quit and do it again later to get the grade, and [i]damn[/i], that tutorial is boring! Also the ""Active Pause"" is buggy, e.g., if you pause while flying at the limit of the aircraft, the aircraft continues to get stressed during pause -- I just got destroyed because I paused during a fast descent: While the game was paused, I started feeling increasing force feedback vibrations on my joystick, then I was dead.  

Apart from bugs, the training missions in general leave large gaps and can be quite unclear at times, their order is also pretty absurd in some sections but that's minor. The time acceleration (sim rate) also is quite buggy (e.g., it seems to disable(interfere with the autopilot in the Cessna 172s w/ G1000) and generally should be used with care: when you turn it up too high for your hardware, there is always a chance that the game will start to stutter badly and finally freeze. I encountered some issues with the landing challenges and other activities so far, and I have finished about 30% of them. E.g., in the bush trip challenges, the refueling by calling the fuel truck does not work, and there are many posts on the internet on it. You have to cheat and bind a key to 'Repair and Refuel' (which should not work via a key press in realistic mode, but it's another bug that can save you from the first one). Another thing is that the majority of the achievements are bugged, i.e., some will not pop up even though you did what is being asked (bush trips for me), but some will also pop  even though I definitely did not meet the requirements (e.g., land at every star airport on the world). Cannot comment on activities much more, as I mainly fly my own flight plans.

Apart from these things, the game is quite good though, and you can find much help on Youtube, although switching between youtube and MSFS is a bit annoying if you do not have a 2nd monitor or a laptop next to your computer. Still overall a good game with a great world but quite some issues. 

It is perfectly possible to fly with a controller, and the default mapping for the Xbox Controller is very well through out. I fly with a Virpil joystick and there was no profile for it, so I had to map everything manually, which is to be expected.

Altogether I would say this is a rather neutral review, but that's not an option on Steam. So while I do not regret my purchase, I have to say I would not recommend friends to get this without knowing about the issues, so I give it a negative for now, because this increases the chance of people reading this. 

My total rating is 7/10: definitely get it if you are happy with flying around on your own in a beautiful world with great planes. Skip it if you need ready-made, working and great missions and are not willing to invest quite a bit of time for getting started, which you will have to do because of the bad/missing training missions and documentation.

Note: If you get it, make sure you get the free world updates by MS at least for your favorite region in the in-game asset manager. It's typically another 10 GB download per region (there are about 10), but they add more detail to that region of the world and are a must-have in my opinion. I bought the ultimate edition, but I guess for most people that is not needed: there are a lot of planes to learn in the standard edition.

Also keep in mind that MS has already, to the great surprise of the community, announced a new version, MSFS 2024. What this means for this game, and the large amounts of money many people have invested in extra content for it, is yet to be seen.",1690539723,1697119186,False,24,1,0.659272909164428711,0,True,False,False

Now, when it comes to the variety of planes available, this game doesn't skimp. Right out of the box, you've got an impressive assortment of flying machines to choose from. So, unless you're on a quest for a specific aircraft, there's no need to break the virtual bank for extras. But for the collectors out there, rejoice! There's a store where you can purchase additional aircraft, and it's not just planes; they've got all sorts of flying contraptions. Hoverboard, anyone?

The game's world is generated from actual server-based map creation. Want to find your house? You can try, but don't be surprised if it doesn't look much like your real-life abode. It's all procedurally generated from data, so your dream mansion might turn into a cozy log cabin.

Now, let's dive into those meticulously detailed cockpits. They're like the Swiss watches of the aviation world, packed with buttons and knobs. But here's the catch: many of them are labeled ""INOP,"" which is just a fancy way of saying ""for display purposes only."" In other words, they're there to make your virtual cockpit look fancy, not to actually press or turn.

As for the terrains, they're breathtakingly realistic. However, not all airports are fully simulated, which is where the DLCs come into play. And speaking of downloadable content, if you're not careful, you might find yourself in ""DLC-hell"" quicker than you can say ""altitude check."" Sure, it's cheaper than buying a real airplane, but those virtual dollars add up!

In the end, the Microsoft Flight Simulator 40th Anniversary Edition is a beautiful flight simulator that'll have aviation enthusiasts like myself logging countless virtual hours in the cockpit. So, buckle up, folks, and get ready for a sky-high adventure that's been 40 years in the making. It's like fine wine; it only gets better with age, even if it makes us all feel a tad older in the process!",1696922695,1696922695,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

My son started trying to fly in the ""all assist"" assistance mode.  The plane kept climbing so hard it would stall and crash.  Only maximum forward stick pressure would fly it level, and any attempt to correct with trim was soon overriden with auto-yoke.

We switched to the middle assistance setting.  That turned off some of those auto settings, but now during lesson two, when she is supposed to be demonstrating straight and level flight in a cruise attitude, the instructor never feeds any throttle.

Predictably, the aircraft slowly sinks and crashes, before she finishes running her mouth and gives you control to potentially save it.

I'm shocked at what a terrible experience this has been.  We've been f***ing around with this simulator all day trying to get the most basic things to work reliably, and they just don't.

Needs some better long-haulers though, but the default 787 and 747-8i are much more flyable now in terms of systems since the AAU2 update, but still need a lot of work in the physics department, at least for the 787 especially, it's too touchy right now. We need some more Boeing narrow bodies too, because get ready for this.... We are about to get an ini A20N, on top of the FBW A20N, on top of the Fenix A320 rework, on top of the Fenix 319/321 coming end of this year, lol. No Airbus long haulers at all though, but I guess that will change soon with Aerosoft releasing their (probably mid, and one engine type only **ahem RR**) A330 soon... whenever that is. Hoping for ini or FBW or FENIX (preferably FENIX) to release an A321NEO so I can do a bunch of United A321neo ops. Probably won't get MSFS2024 for a fat while unless its really a huge upgrade and addons stop supporting MSFS2020. Doesn't look that much different and I don't want to re-setup everything. Just finished a 787-10 long haul from Newark (EWR) to Tel Aviv (TLV). Good flight, had some problems with the LNAV and vectors on that EWR4 departure with the plane not following LNAV... Note to self... LNAV after a vector does NOT work in the current update of the 787. Other than that, everything else was fine.

update1 7-20-22: was bouncing back and forth between xplane 11  fsx and fs2020 having trouble deciding what i like better.

while the dls are nuts i have to say since the top gun add ons this game has loaded quickly and played smoothly and i have not had much to complain about. 

would like better camera options and increased zoom out to take in that scenery.

Second update 4-15-23: this game is amazing now. vr works well, graphics smooth with live weather etc. finally!

third update 9-27-23:  as others have said, i do wish one could simply jump into the game and fly. every time. all the updates are truly tedious. and every time i get it working well, and get used to the game working, it randomly starts the tedium over again.  now its crashing during play. while smooth and gorgeous.  with the next version coming soon its now clear this whole thing was an expensive (time and money) beta test.

update 4 10-1-23: playing on ultra with 40-80 fps. live traffic and weather. working AMAZING

It hurts any CPU/GPU you throw at it when you try to squeeze out every last frame with as much detail as possible, while keeping it smooth.  My fans run full speed and I have to wear headphones, but you should be wearing a set in the cockpit, anyway.

The fun begins when you run MSFS on enough computer to deliver 30 FPS smoothly on medium level detail in a VR headset.  Magic starts happening when you have more computer and can add more detail and/or better performance.

I bought premium at launch because I had the cash to throw at it.  Don't, unless you absolutely have to (you really don't).  Just add what you want from base and exercise some patience in the Marketplace.  Very little is worth full price.  Some planes just suck, some add ons just toss garbage into your experience, and all of it will eventually go on sale at some point for you to impulse spend and find out for yourself.  I'm looking at you Reno Air Races.  You are worth $25, not $100.  Personally, I found the birds, balloons, and improved runway textures, and upgrading my local airport are nice aesthetic touches, just not at full price.  

Detractors can have their say, but I will leave it like this.  I am satisfied.  Flying along the Colorado River in downtown Austin, TX, or along any of its highways and tolls, is a flashback to 2020-2021, right down to the construction in progress.  The Tesla gigafactory is construction just starting.  East of KAUS, inside the racetrack, my house isn't up, but the foundation looks pretty accurate at ground level and the single tree on the greenbelt immediately behind the house is shockingly there, all by itself as in the real world.  I don't know how that happened, but it absolutely created a sense of deja vu.

Onto the next 350 hours.

The players are challenged with downloading gigabytes of mandatory updates, pushed out at random times throughout the year, while looking at the pictures of various planes and helicopters. (I guess that is the ""Flight"" portion). 

The game also offers a unique feature: a download progress bar that can actually move backwards and well as forward, so the player has to guess when the download will actually finish, if at all. 

While the download may succeed, the update can still fail (that is the ""simulation"" part of the game),. In this case the process will repeat again, which offers an excellent replayability value. 

The game comes from a small indie developer called ""Microsoft"", therefore, some growing pains and occasional bugs are expected. With refreshing honesty, the developer also freely admits its inexperience with this genre right in the title of this release: ""40th Anniversary"".

The devs have also promised to release a new version in 2024, in which the download simulation process will happen not before but during the game, offering even more excitement.",1695951178,1695951178,True,60,119,0.810581445693969727,0,True,False,False

As a private pilot with over 250 hours of real-life flying experience, I can't express enough how much I've enjoyed Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. This simulation game is a game-changer for aviation enthusiasts and aspiring pilots alike. It offers an incredibly immersive experience that is remarkably true to life.

One of the standout features of Flight Simulator 2020 is the stunning graphics and attention to detail. The landscapes, cities, and airports are so realistic that it feels like you're actually flying over the places you've only dreamt of visiting. The realism extends to the aircraft themselves, from the cockpit instruments to the flight dynamics. It's as close to real flying as you can get without leaving the ground.

But what truly elevates the experience is having the right gear. Investing in a good quality flight stick, throttle quadrant, and rudder pedals is a game-changer. The tactile feedback and precision these peripherals offer add a level of immersion that's hard to put into words. It's not just a game; it's a full-fledged flight simulation.

Flight Simulator 2020 also has a strong community and a wealth of user-generated content, from mods to real-time weather integration. This creates an ever-evolving and dynamic experience, making each flight unique and challenging.

In conclusion, if you're passionate about aviation or have ever dreamt of taking to the skies, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 is an absolute must-have. With the right gear, it's an exhilarating and authentic journey that will satisfy both novices and experienced aviators. The level of realism is unparalleled, and it's a testament to the incredible advances in flight simulation technology. Happy flying!",1695924053,1695924053,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But I have played DCS and it makes this Microsoft Flight ""Simulator"" feel like cheap plastic. I love certain elements of MSFS. I love the graphical wonders achieved, the realism and scope of the world we live in, and also the live weather system. But damn it the entire thing feels as clunky as can be. And to be honest, the live weather system and satellite mapping are novelties that aren't likely to keep you all that interested for long. I flew around my hometown of Seattle/Everett; that was cool. What do I do now? I went to a couple of places I wanted to see but that was that. What do I do now exactly? 

 The entire experience is not even close to being optimized. DCS is made by a small developer, I give them a pass for the numerous issues they have. Microsoft, a mega corp, makes this flight sim and I just don't understand how it has so many little issues. I compare the camera system, the high fidelity controls, the actual flight simulation, and other things to DCS and MSFS just fails on everything. Again, it's super clunky. The only two things that MSFS beats DCS in are landscape visuals and the fact that you can fly airliners. Which, DCS could easily do and it would do it far better, but they are focused on military applications. Bottom line, if you want a flight sim, it's DCS. If you already have DCS, get this and you will get a bit of fun out of visiting places across the world. I didn't appreciate how truly special DCS is until I played MSFS. 

PS: There is maybe one white dude you can use as your avatar in MSFS. I'm not even sure if he is white to be honest. There are 20 avatars and us white devils can't even get one. So, it's just spitting in my face. I'm sorry that white men enjoy and are good at flying planes Microsoft. The commercial airlines are racially discriminating against white men in hiring for pilots.....that actually matters. Not sure what Microsoft is trying to accomplish with their crappy social engineering.

PPS: I just uninstalled through Steam and it only freed up 1.5gb of space. The game is almost 200gb.....they have the entire thing hidden in some folder. So, when you go to uninstall it, you aren't really uninstalling it. Just another awful bit of nonsense from Microsoft.",1695288765,1695868359,False,1,0,0,4,True,False,False

On the one hand it allows you to fly a wide variety of aircraft across the entire globe.  So if that was the one advertised feature, yes it achieves that.

Looking deeper into the sim though, it is quite a buggy experience.  I've posted in the forums to say that to be this game feels very much BETA quality, many of the basic mechanics don't work very well (stress damage, ground handling, Ai aircraft etc).   

Other features seem to be been implemented to please more of the casual simmer, such as multiplayer.  Unlike other sims like IL-2 or DCS (or even Elite Dangerous) it's not possible to form community groups and set individual rules around what type of flying is allowed.  So your left with too either play solo, having to manually setup groups (maximum 8 players I think) or accept that you have to live in a free-for-all world where your perfect approach you're trying to film is spoiled by some maverick in his F/A 18.  I've seen started to move to a more solo approach and relying on 3rd party addons to add the necessary ""life"" to the sim for these reasons which is a shame.

Part of these problems stem from the game being supported cross-platform for both PC and XBOX therefore Microsoft has to run the servers unlike the other sims I've mentioned which are PC only and in most cases require a 3rd party multiplayer server.

The read-me files states to delete all old MSFS files and add-ons so I did and retried without success so I returned the title successfully. I found more in the read-me install notes so I purchased the simulator again to retry and this time the timestamp was at 21 hours so I submitted a refund expecting to get declined but tried anyway. Steam did refund again and I will dismiss this simulator pursuit. I will wait for MSFS2024 and hope all goes well during the next install attempt.

I've played 50 hours right? Wrong. I have about 3 hours of gameplay before the game crashed and never worked again.
After the game crashed, i tried to play the game and had several issues. Went through A LOT of different troubleshooting I found online and here on Steam, and nothing seemed to fix it.

Then, I decided to reinstall the game. That's where most of my hours of """"""""""gameplay"""""""""" comes from. When you install the game, the downloading goes through a secondary launcher, so every hours downloading count as gameplay. On top of that, the speed for the download is incredibly slow, to the point I had to leave it downloading overnight, adding extra hours once the download finished just because the PC was sitting there waiting for me to come back.

After downloading, it got stuck in decompression. It would be something like Decompressing 100 out of 480 files. Then I paused the stuck decompression, closed the launcher and launched it again. Now it got stuck lets say on 30 out of 380 files, which means that the first 100 files were indeed decompressed. Well, that process happened around 20 times until I finally managed to decompress the whole game and play.

Nope. Textures were missing. My plane was pink and I couldn't see anything in ""first person"".
So I did the obvious, checked the integrity of the files which made the game, somehow, download another 20GB of content in the launcher.
Guess what, same problems with decompression after that.
Guess what again, textures still missing.

Asked for a refund. Nope. You already have 50 hours.

I spend 75AUD in something that doesn't work and I can't get a refund.

Zero updates, no communication, total silence despite it being a major inconvenience to the community. Yet, we see plenty of time being devoted to making pretty advertisements and screen-grabs for new content for purchase?

All you get from Steam download is a 2-3 Gigabyte installer which take 10 times longer than Steam would to install the game! Then the rest of the add-ons are installed in-game at a snails pace too... Over 400 Gigabytes my total install adds up to; it takes over half a day to finish!  Ark: Survival Evolved at 400 Gigabyte took less than 2 hours to install‚ÄΩ And to add salt to the wound, guess what you can't do when 'this' game installs itself; play any other game on Steam!!!! Steam thinks your playing the game, when your actually watching a 12 hour -plus long DOWNLOAD SCREEN!!
And the final insult is that if you don't pay active attention to the installer it'll try to install the add-ons to an utterly stupid location no game or there installs have any business installing themselves! Especially if your C drive is intended for the OS ONLY! And don't even think about trying to Move, Migrate or god forbid Copy the install to a new place (Even with Steams own build in game moving tool), Cause ""You've Guessed It!"" It'll just re-download everything all over again instead, regardless of the fact that it's already there‚ÄΩ How much money are these Devs haemorrhaging on unnecessary server bandwidth alone‚ÄΩ Steams system does everything for you!

I've played this in Game Pass before and I can attest that it has some significant flaws. Many parts of the world are not covered by photogrammetry so you would have default autogen. And if you fly offline, the default scenery is worse than you get in X Plane. 

But The biggest drawback for me is the overly complicated camera system and the tedious built in replay tool which makes capturing take-off/in flight and landing videos harder than it should be. Ideally we should have a replay and camera system very similar to X Plane.

1. Game takes forever to download/file size too large -> Well what did you expect. This isn't flightgear, (Don't worry flightgear, I love you), it's an extremely realistic and detailed simulator. To get the quality you deserve you need large files. The base game is something around 150 GB's, which took me, on my essentially broadband internet roughly 38 hours. My install, with the addition of multiple addons, is around 230 GB's.
2. It runs horribly/my computer can't handle it -> Once again what did you expect its not flightgear (I promise I love you FG). It's not going to do to well on your Dell Inspiron laptop from 2012, however you don't need a supercomputer. I'm running a i5-6400, GTX 1050Ti, and 8 GB's of ram. Setting the game to low/medium setting resolves almost all performance issues with the exception everyone in a while of a little stuttering when close to the ground and surrounded by trees.
3. The game doesn't install properly/It's too hard -> Well for this I don't have anything except you did something wrong. There's very few steps to installing. You launch it, tell it where to install to, hit install and let it do the rest. 

MSFS is a great simulator, especially if you have friends to play with. There's little to say against it except the price of it and the addons in game but that is the price of having a simulator of this quality. You can always buy things when they go on sale. If you're interesting in flying or enjoy aviation then this is a great purchase, as long as you have something better than your childhood laptop.",1694998987,1695260206,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is absolute garbage.  It does all of it's downloads inside the game engine, despite the fact that the initial download is so large and slow (it will be well below your max download speed.  Even if you have gigabit, it is going to do about 50 mbps) you'll need to do it overnight.  That means you have to run your computer all night in high CPU and GPU usage modes.  It is absolutely unnecessary, and the number one worst distribution system I've seen in my 30 Plus years as a PC gamer, and my 15+ years as an IT Analyst.  It is an embarrassment.  Asobo and Microsoft should be ashamed of themselves for not coming up with, for instance, a seperate downloader that you have to run OUTSIDE the game engine before you can play.  You know what I'm talking about, it's what every other game and large program does.  I don't care that it is prehistorically slow, I can deal with that, but it is both prehistorically slow AND resource intensive.  It is absolutely unnecessary.  When I upgraded to a new computer, one of the first things I thought was ""Ugh, I'll have to download MSFS 2020 again.""  I put it off for months because it was such a horrendous experience.  Microsoft has no shame so I'm not going to bother with them, but shame on you Asobo.  Just another example of how Microsoft is an awful, out of touch, megalithic symbol of mediocrity.  Asobo probably got enough revenue from this that they aren't super worried about follow up business, but I now have about as much faith in their engineers as I have in the Zambian Space Program.  That said, keep in mind that knowing how awful reinstall was going to be, I still downloaded it again.  Once you get it installed, it is impressive.  The thing that bothers me is that that impressiveness does not require a stupid updater.  It could be both a great game, and have a regular old game installer.  I understand this is a complicated program, but so is Starfield, and that downloaded just fine.  I understand it's maps are bigger, and it's going to take time, but why on earth does the game engine have to be running during the unusually slow download?  Swallow your pride, admit you made a mistake, and FIX IT.

UPDATE: Once I got it re-installed, and got up in the air, I am shocked how bad it looks.  I'm running an RX 7800 XT, 32 GB of 6000 MHZ RAM, a 7600x processor, my computer is a hotrod, and it's a new hotrod.  It routinely drops to 10 FPS in VR.  Once you start knocking down the graphics settings so you can get smooth framerates, it goes from looking decent to looking like a watercolor painting really quickly.  For some reason that was more acceptable to me when I was running this on a RTX 1070, or a RTX 2080, but my latest upgrade nearly doubled my system speed (GPU, RAM, CPU, HD all twice as fast) and it still looks like crap.  I'm going back to DCS.  The only reason I even tried this again is because I used to fly IRL, and I wanted to log some Cessna time.  The Cessna that comes with my game version is the Garmin glass cockpit version, so it didn't even spark nostalgia (it is VERY different from the Cessna 172SP that I used to fly.)  To get the plane I want I could spend 60 bucks on the deluxe version upgrade.  I only care about that one plane, and I'm not spending 60 bucks for it.  This is a bit of an FU from Microsoft to former pilots.  They know that very few of us had glass cockpits on the Cessna's we learned on so they try to gouge us for extra cash to get the less capable version of the airplane.  The only reason you would want it is that you used to fly it, otherwise the Garmin version is better.  DCS is a very different flight sim, but it has gorgeous maps that a high end system can render in VR with smooth frame rates.  There is no Cessna in DCS, but the Cessna in my version of MSFS is wrong anyway, so no huge loss there, and the overall experience in DCS is better.  The MSFS whole world map is cool, but if it's a whole world watercolor that's less cool.  This whole experience has made me appreciate the crisp, smooth, fast rendering of DCS even more.  DCS is a  combat simulator, but if you aren't interested in that aspect of flying you can create freeflight missions easily enough.  The plane choices are geared towards combat aircraft, but you can find a few unarmed trainers if that isn't your thing.  The base DCS package is free, so check it out before you buy this game.",1695027121,1695072609,False,147,13,0.792298436164855957,13,True,False,False

Along with X-Plane, it's a must-have for all aviation enthusiasts - whether you like flying to explore, performing missions, flying for airlines, it's all there. Contains a large selection of very detailed planes. It's impossible to review it without writing a book, it's best if you watch YouTube reviews instead. 

It's for everyone, you can can enable all assists and have fun or use it to study for your licence and everything in between. There are many free and paid addons (scenery, aircraft, objects, etc.). 

In my experience, it'll run well on an older machine such as i7-6770 (4 cores) with RTX2060 and SATA SSD, however I'd strongly recommend at least a mid-range system with 8 cores/16 threads @ 4.5GHz, RTX4070 or equivalent AMD, NVME SSD and fast DDR4, ideally DDR5 memory.

Controller support is fantastic. Don't try it with a keyboard only, you wouldn't drive a car with a keyboard. Again, I'd recommend a joystick (with a throttle slider). However, the xbox/ps controller support is excellent once you master the basics of flying.

* - I highly recommend that you get the Steam version instead of Microsoft store to avoid installation problems.

Buy game, marvel at it's small download size (~2Gb).
Launch game expecting some extra downloading, as 2gb would be on par with flight Sim 98!
Find there is a 160gb download to do, which requires the game to be running (not just the normal steam download process).
           - This gives problems if you want to play something else and Steam complains you're already 'playing'  Flight Sim.
Anyway, get it all downloaded (which over a 40mb/s connection wasn't quick).
Leave it for the weekend to come and play your newly purchased game, to find there is now a 12.5GB update to do (which you only get told about when you've launched the game - again rather than the standard steam installer).

So in summary, so far I've ""played this game for 18 hours"" which has been entirely downloading content and not actually launched the game.

Add into the mix you can't throttle the downloads in their installer so I expect my wife is plotting where to bury my body this point. (Oh the irony, I had to pause the download so I had enough bandwidth to post this!)

In short: Wait like 3 more years for the game to actually work. Wait for a sale and buy only the base edition
edit: WE WERE LIED TO AND SCAMMED!  THEY NEVER FIXED IT AND ARE NOW DROPPING IT WITH NO REFUND GIVEN! DO NOT BUY!!!!.




You shouldn't charge ¬£100 for a game that has ¬£100000s of micro transactions. Community market places are a joke and are a scam pretending to be a way to credit creators. banners are everywhere telling to BUY something. Wait for sale buy base edition. Minecraft {a another microsoft game} proves a  Community market place just kills the community the game is also buggy and in a pre alpha state If your not  desperate wait a few years for bug fixes and content updates. and only ever buy the base game

I am gonna get hate for this but  realise ¬£100 is alot thats almost 2 big meals for 5 people at a fancy resturant its a big percentage to a new console or something actually good when you spend ¬£100 you expect better then this. Its a fun game but the you out of thier way to make it hard to recommend and with practices I can not force myself to support. its gets a bad review 7/10 for the gameplay and graphics {needs more content} but 0/10 for everything else {price, practices etc}

¬£100 for a broken alpha that has a marketplace is a joke plane and simple and I worry for everything microsoft related after recent games from them.
The fact I got the Award proves that a lot of good reviews are just shills ¬£100+ game they don't even know how rain looks like.

I use a Gladiator Evo joystick which is a big factor in enjoying the experience (RTX2060 Super GPU).  I have owned various IL2 versions and some other older flight software.
Lots of depth in terms of aircraft and airport features and good options in levels of difficulty/realism.
Plenty of good freeware but other expansions can be expensive if not on sale.
Standard ground detail is very good with 'crafted' areas (Microsoft or other) and also good at higher altitudes but less good at low levels (e.g. cars caught in the map scans are flat and bridges often not rendered).  Using AI etc to improve these in future releases would be a big plus.

CONSISTENT ANNOYING SPAWNING IN THE AIR OR ON THE RUNWAY N O T   W H A T I PICKED.... FIX YOUR GOD DAMN GAME. 

Update x9
It's been this long and you crappy devs still won't fix the aircraft to full function.  AP bugs, SEVERAL switches INOP STILL... pathetic.

Right Click to move view.. DISABLES CONTROL INPUTS... What the hell are you guys on?

Spot view still not implemented.. screw your drone view.. screw it!  Asobo you suck!

Default joystick hat is quick views... W..T..F!!!! you guys seriously made this into a crappy arcade.


Update x8... your physics on realistic still doesn't feel right.  It is like playing a total arcade game.. rudder on the runway there is NO feedback like your in outer space or something... flying is ridiculous too EXTREMELY arcade like.  Devs talked up the game.. yeah they must have been on drugs.   Then there's the menu UI and that is horrible.  Default controls to the joystick's view hat.. pressing right twice takes me out of the cockpit.. WHAT???  I want a POV hat to function as it DOES IN EVERY. SINGLE. OTHER. FLIGHT SIM... AND ALL THE MSFS VERSIONS BEFORE THIS CRAP RELEASE.   I'm still PISSED ABOUT THE external views.. I'm way happier when I use DCS or XP11.  F this Asobo!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Update x7... the external view S U Ck S and makes me dizzy and shows the aircraft in some odd proportion.. NOTHING like ALL previous versions of Microsoft Flight Simulator... this version NEEDS that regular spot view back.. NO I DO NOT WANT TO USE THE DRONE VIEW.  BRING BACK THE ORIGINAL SPOT VIEW.

Update x6: piss poorly written, update has taken over 17 hours....

Update x5:
Update 125GB.. forget that.  uninstalled.

Update x4:
FIX the external view... no I do not want to use the drone mode.  Are you guys suggesting that view because you support drone interference with aircraft flying?  WTH!  GET THE MAIN EXTERNAL VIEW BACK THAT HAVE BEEN IN THE MSFS TITLES SINCE 5.0!
Update x3:
After a several months of not playing, I decided to give it another go.  Updating process still sucks.  External view still sucks.  Asobo and Microsoft have lost their minds with this garbage.   XP12 LETS ROLL!

UPDATED x2:

Tried updating this piece of crap again.  It failed mid way and there is no selection on if I want to play the game without the update like ALL previous versions of MSFS.  This is by far the worst software I've ever used.  For now I'm uninstalling, I may reconsider once it has more planes, liveries, and optional updates.  Maybe I'll wait until Microsoft Flight Simulator II.  This whole game is INOP!!!

I spend more time trying to update this piece of crap than actually playing.  All other games are fine, Asobo really screwed up with this one.  Still the release is like a beta, full of issues and airplanes that aren't completely feature rich. 

Unstable, absolutely full of bugs.  Full price game for a sub-par beta like release.  One livery per plane, horribly designed external view system - makes me dizzy.  They didn't keep the spot view system that has been around in every release prior.  Strange flight dynamics for all aircraft seem like they aren't affected by air stream.  Very arcade like game.  Bad UI, menu is poorly designed - all previous MSFS versions were very organized, this one not at all.  UI - again, hard to figure out controls and customize them.  I needed to look up help for a lot of issues I thought I could figure out on my own coming from playing every MSFS release since FS98.  Never should have been labeled Microsoft Flight Simulator but instead just Asobo's Airplane Arcade.  I keep telling all the people I used to play FS9/FSX/P3D/XP11 with to hold on and don't spend an ounce of your time with this product yet.  The community is doing all the reporting - dirty work for free.  PATHETIC.

I can NOT honestly in good faith recommend this to anyone.  This simulator, in its current form, should cost NO MORE than $30 for the best version.  NOTHING in the in game market place should cost more than $20.

EDIT 9/12/23
IF you can wrap your head around the limitations of the software as well as your own hardware in relation to this flight sim, there is quite a bit of fun to be had.  It's far from a perfect experience to set everything up properly.  If you can get past that major hurdle of getting set up and also understand that there are many technical limitations separating this from the real life physics of flying, then you can have a decent experience flying the world from the comfort of your home.  Some aircraft ARE definitely better than others, and it would be a wise choice to look into these before spending your hard earned money on something in the store.

While I may have quite a bit of negative things to say, this sim is not without its redeeming factors.  I believe that what upsets me the most is the lack of transparency between the devs and the customer base regarding features and quality of life updates.  This is a decent sim, but it could have been executed much better.  There are still many ongoing issues that keep me from easily recommending this to just anyone.

TLDR:

If you really like aviation and have had fun flying in other simulators, give this a shot, it takes a pretty ridiculous long time to install and get set up, but once you get there and know what to do, its definitely fun to go exploring in an aircraft that you really like, even if the overall flight physics of the experience seem to favor the arcade style of flight simulation while the visuals aim for recreating that photo-realistic scenario.",1599989421,1694568831,False,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This includes planes like the PMDG 737(best addon for msfs2020), and the flybywire a320. The scenery is more than sufficient for routes like this where you are more worried about the cockpit and not necessarily the accuracy of some random neighborhood you've never heard of. VFR simmers are gonna fall in love. Just like with Prepar3d, or FSX, be prepared to have some money aside for addons. With this sim it's not necessarily required but there are small life enhancers I would reccomend such as REX to get better seasonal textures, and other random things such as fsrealistic, which I feel is a must have add on.

[h2] Realism [/h2]
MSFS 2020 is mind-blowingly realistic. It's like sitting in a real airplane but in your living room. Everything in the cockpit, like buttons and switches, is exactly where it should be in a real plane. The way the planes move in the game feels just like they do in real life. It's like you're really flying.

It's not just the planes; everything in the game feels real. The way the sun shines into the cockpit, the reflections on the instruments, and the sound of the engines all make you feel like you're actually flying. Whether you love planes or you're new to this, you'll be amazed at how lifelike MSFS 2020 is.

[h2] World [/h2]
The world in MSFS 2020 is astonishing. [b]It's not just a made-up world; it's our world. The whole planet is recreated in incredible detail.[/b] Whether you want to fly over famous places like New York City or explore the Amazon rainforest, it's all there, and it looks incredibly real.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3008797845
The landscapes are so accurate. [b]You'll see busy cities, beautiful hills, and peaceful lakes, all looking just like the real thing.[/b] Even places you may not know about are recreated with amazing detail. It's not just about the big landmarks; it's about the whole world, and the level of detail is unbelievable.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3026094521
Plus, the world is alive. You'll see real weather happening, like rain, snow, and thunderstorms, which affect your flight just like in real life. The day turns into night, with beautiful sunsets and sunrises that make everything look stunningly real.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3001165113
[h2] Aircraft Variety [/h2]
MSFS 2020 has many different kinds of planes to choose from. Whether you like fast jets or classic propeller planes, there's something for everyone. Each plane is made with extreme care, inside and out, to make it look just like the real thing.
It's not just about the planes themselves; you can also customize your flights in many ways, like picking where you start and finish, choosing the time of day, and setting the weather. You have a lot of control over how you fly, making each flight special.

[h2] User-Friendly [/h2]
What makes MSFS 2020 special is that it's easy to play. Even though it's super realistic, it's made so that everyone, whether you're an expert or just starting, can have fun. If you're new to flying, you can start with simple controls and get better as you go. The game has tutorials and helpers that make sure you don't get overwhelmed and can enjoy the game.

[h1] MSFS Beyond Flying [/h1]
In addition to the freedom to fly anywhere in the world at your leisure, Microsoft Flight Simulator (MSFS) offers Landing Challenges and Bush Trips as its core content.

[b]Bush Trips[/b] are pre-designed flight adventures that replicate real-life journeys undertaken by bush pilots, known for navigating rugged and remote areas, often contending with challenging weather conditions and landing on unpaved airstrips. In MSFS, these bush trips provide you with an opportunity to experience these thrilling flights while putting your flying skills and navigation abilities to the test.

[b]Landing challenges[/b] in MSFS 2020 present thrilling scenarios that assess your piloting skills by demanding precise and safe landings at various airports worldwide. Each challenge offers a unique experience and situation to keep the gameplay engaging. There is a scoring system, rewards, and leaderboards associated with these landing challenges.


[h2] Cons of MSFS 2020 [/h2]
Long loading times and certain scenery in specific locations may appear unattractive and distorted, even after world updates. These are my primary concerns regarding the game.

[h2] Announcement of MSFS 2024 [/h2]
I do feel betrayed because they promised that MSFS 2020 would be supported for up to 10 years, and yet next year they plan to release a new game in the franchise. However, Microsoft has stated that MSFS 2020 will continue to receive updates. I'm skeptical of their word now, given their failure to uphold their promise.

[h2] Should you still buy MSFS 2020? [/h2]
[b]Yes, it's definitely worth it, especially when on discount. The game offers a wealth of content and quality of life updates, including major world updates since its release. If you decide to purchase it, you'll have access to substantial, high-quality content. Currently, it remains the only game that provides an experience close to real-life flying, with a 1:1 ratio of the entire world at your fingertips. Furthermore, we have yet to receive new information on the release date of MSFS 2024.[/b]

[h1] Final Thoughts [/h1]
[b]In a nutshell, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 is incredibly realistic, with a huge, detailed world to explore, lots of different planes, and an easy-to-play experience for all aviation enthusiasts. Its dedication to realism, dynamic world, and user-friendly design makes it a game that anyone interested in aviation or looking for an amazing virtual flying adventure should play.[/b]

In the boundless skies of virtual aviation, 'Pilot Training Flight Simulator' has carved a niche as a celebrated gem, commanding the attention and admiration of aviators within Roblox. Meanwhile, 'Microsoft Flight Simulator' soars as a titan in the broader gaming cosmos, offering an unparalleled journey through the heavens.

The notion that one is an echo of the other invites contemplation on the intricate web of inspiration that shapes the gaming world. While they share the same canvas of the sky, their strokes of creativity differ markedly.

In this intriguing juxtaposition, one finds a delicate dance between emulation and innovation. 'Pilot Training Flight Simulator' thrives within the confines of Roblox, while 'Microsoft Flight Simulator' unfolds on a global stage.

MSFS 2020 is a simulator which provides you with everything you need, such as real world and live weather, physics, the whole planet, airports, and so on... but not much more than, it can become boring quick enough if you don't plug in some career addons (Such as Neofly, A pilot life chapter 2, SkyPark, Onair) or simply joining a virtual airline.

As becoming a flight simmer, you will find what you like the most in aviation by touching and flying basics aircraft included the simulator, whether it's airliners, bush flying, military, sea planes, helicopters etc. From any of these, there is almost no limits on what you can do in order to push your experience in the direction you want. The flight simulation modding community is huge, there are tons and tons of addons and mods so you can customize your experience the way you want, to the immersion you want, to the degree of each you want.

The flight simulation community is huge and very helpful. I personally mostly fly Airliners on the VATSIM network (Real People doing the Air Trafic Control along with other players piloting their aircraft), I am part of a few Virtual Airlines (comparable to guilds/clans from other games) such as Ryanair, Virtual AirCanada, Southwest, Delta Airlines, EasyJet, they provide me with my flights which I complete for them in the most safely and realistic way possible. I use what they call ''Study Level'' aircraft, they are 3rd party developed planes very close to reality. I also uses addons which improve realism such as FSRalistic and FS2Crew (Last one adds a VIrtual First Officer to my airliners).

I just enjoy it so much, MSFS2020 is beautiful, I could not enjoy my flight simulation as much on a lower end simulator such as xPlane or P3D in regards of graphics.

The simulator as become much more stable over time, therefore always require some tweaking in order to find the perfect graphics for you. Its very, very cpu bound, think of getting a stronger CPU especially if doing airliners.  I will say that, the simulator (while for some not being a ''game'' but really a ''Simulator'') requires some technical skills, either because of addons and mods additions, but also tweaking of settings for your PC & Desired experience.

Happy flying

When I first bought this game everything worked just like they did in FSX back in the day after I tweaked the assist options to suit my experience in sims. 

For some reason an update just shy of a GIG dropped and broke everything. It seems like some AI assist options cant be shut off. The UI says you selected off but when you fly Jesus takes the wheel in creative ways never thought possible and he tries to murder you.

Ranging from completely unresponsive autopilot controls in the 747 locking your thrust to maximum, to helicopters doing back flips and spinning out of control when the trims are set properly, the experience is like a beta arcade style flying game that is riddled with bugs.

No im not stupid, I flew the 747 the first day I installed this game and everything worked just like it did in FSX plus some extra interactive systems I had to learn. Now nothing functions like you would expect and its extremely aggravating.

Granted SOME older or simpler planes work as they should and they are nice to fly but I bought the big man expansion pack and some un-needed update completely ruined the experience",1690336649,1693796722,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm a flight student and would have loved to work on my takeoff and landing procedures BEFORE my lessons this weekend.  Unfortunately, I reached 70% after one week of not being able to use my PC.  Netlimiter had to be set under 350 KB/sec.  I thought I would make it, but TWICE it deleted 20GB and brought me back to 52%.  What a waste of 9 days.

I just bought X-Plane 12.  Don't waste your precious time/money for such a subpar product and company that will take both without regret.

First Update:  Its been about 36 hours and I'm back at 36MB out of 122GB.  I reinstalled Windows and it seems to have done nothing at all.  I tried downloading netlimiter as some people in the forums have suggested setting my download rate to under 2.3MB/s. I'll update if this works.

Original Review: This is a neat simulator if you can get past the initial ""update"" phase.  I let this thing run all night on a good internet connection, only to have it barely reach 8% of the download.

I had other work to do so I paused and restarted my computer.  Now I get to start over on the download!  Wow.  Not only that, but if you let MSFS2020 run in the background, you will LOSE DOWNLOAD PROGRESS.  I was just at 750MB.. I went to get some things on Amazon, and now I'm back down to 400MB out of 122GB.

Good:

- Training lessons are kind-of approachable
- Various systems are in-game, like checklists, ATC, AI planes, map, etc. These would require additional plugins and money in other sim
- Weather is in-game and will never require a plugin
- You can fly low and actually look outside
- Photorealistic

Bad:

- Control mapping is inconsistent. Not everything in the plane can be mapped to external physical controls.
- Some existing features are broken, like holding mouse button will disable all joystick or flight control inputs. The bug was introduced with XBOX support, with no acknowledgment from the dev team.
- Team promised 10 year support, yet, they are already planning new game release.
- In-game ATC is stupid. Asks for traffic in-sight at FL330.
- Plugins and planes need to be developed in javascript, the most atrocious language ever. No wonder it takes took third-party developers so much time to release quality content.

In my original review, 3 years ago, I said ""There are some things in this sim that are simply done right and promise a good foundation going forward"". I expected a lot, because a lot was promised. This was supposed to be only the foundation.

The main additions since the release were content, VNAV implementation, and XBOX stuff that degraded mouse usage.

If we discount the content and look at the game itself, 3 years later, we still have foundation, with basically the same systems we had at the release. So much for expectations.

This confirms my old rule that what you see at game launch, is what you get in the end, no matter what promises are put forward.

Now behold, here you have another coding miracle. If you thought that Arma 2 or Arma 3 performance was bad, hold on, because in this game, empty field with nearly nothing to render can yield you astonishing 25 fps. Do they use any kind of occlusion culling at all?


The game is so terribly coded and cpu limited that DLSS produces LESS FPS in certain situations. 

DX12 implementation is so laughable and botched that you are no longer surprised why Vulkan or DXVK on Linux can perform better than DX api on its native platform, Windows. 

If you have ever wondered if you should get the Xbox Console, Jesus Christ, MS games are so bad and the product stack so confusing I don't even know how is the latest xbox console branded or PS5, let this be the answer. 


There is a REASON why multi-platform games run significantly worse on the Xbox than on PS5 despite on paper, MS having stronger cpu and if I remember right, even the gpu. 


BECAUSE MS API CALLED DX12 is piece of ********* ************* ********.  You can have the best hw, but if the sw is ******* then the outcome will be ******* too.

No to mention, this so called ""simulator"" is as of a simulator as Forward Horizon 5. 

No wonder they have given up on this game and announced MS FS 2024.

I am glad I only paid 13,99 ‚Ç¨ for it thanks to steam sale price error.

Another funny thing is they wanted to sell this game to console peasants on Xbox and they can't get even the fundamental thing right, the inputs.

It doesn't matter what kind of sensitivity and deadzones I choose, the inputs are trash, the nose of aircraft is jumpy and nervous, it moves often abruptly up and down, the controls lack stability and finesse, feel jerky unless you turn all the possible assistances on but then, it is not you flying anymore. If you set up sensitivity to linear, it doesn't feel linear at all on controller either.

UPDATE2:  Even though progress has been made... the download manager is still the worst manager I've ever dealt with in my life.  Prepare to be infuriated with 1) just downloading the game in the first place and 2) getting hit with non-optional updates.

UPDATE1:  It looks like a lot of progress has been made to the data management and the general back-end of the sim.  I think this game is finally at a point where it's user friendly enough for folks without NASA grade PCs.

ORIGINAL:  The simulator itself is brilliant but don't waste your time on this until the download issue is fixed.  Updates are several gigs and you cannot choose to opt out.  Normally several gigs wouldn't be too much of an issue but this particular connection is just baffling me.

But as far as patching, over the last 2-3 years, nothing has changed, lmited download speed, 
a little faster now, downloading at 130Mbit/s (ca 16MB/s) but still far from satisfactory, which means patching is a VERY long process..   While steam allows me to download with 1000mbit/s (125MB/s) the studio is really out of touch with modern updating/patching. 


Game play 5/5
Everything in terms of the game 5/5

The software launcher/patcher -50/5

When there is a patch,  NOPE.. 

1. Steam has a patch, fine.  It's fastdownload, fast patching.
2. BUT THEN THE LAUNCHER PATCHES.  (yes i did all the useless tips they share)
still my downloads never goes above 15mb/s 20mb/s if im lucky. which is basically only 10% bandwidth used.
And it downloads single files, and aparently install them 1 at time between downloads.  OMG,, this is like 
late 1990's or early 2000s..   

I do not understand why they dont just make a single file patch and let that patch the game.

So imagine game is installed, you don't play much ,  but now you want to fly for a few hours.
Launch the game, then nope.  litterally 3-4 hours patching awaiting..  Ohh yes on top of being forced to
run that awfull xbox live bs ontop on steam..

The developers at Asorbo Studio had obviously released the game far too early on Tuesday 18th August 2020 with not enough development having been done on the game, which is why the game is still very defective and bug-riddled.

Nothing ever works right, I managed to crash into Heathrow on the very first flight and I couldn't even fly anywhere with the AI co-pilot controlling the aircraft (Boeing 747-8i) which forced me to have to restart the flight - the failed flight still ended up in my logbook and there is no way of removing it from the logbook.

The AI co-pilot also did not follow the suggested path quite properly when taxiing to the departure runway,   On landing at Frankfurt am Main (EDDF), the aircraft also did not line up with the arrival runway properly, the AI co-pilot also did not follow the suggested route to the arrival gate quite properly, running over a stationary turboprop on the way.

With the second flight, the ATC controller kept telling the AI co-pilot to climb to flight level FL390 / FL410 / FL430, and the nav waypoints all had the distances to the next waypoint together with the expected altitude (e.g. FL430, using the IFR high altitude airways), but somehow the AI co-pilot kept ignoring all ATC instructions and all nav waypoints, opting to fly the plane at 36,000 to 38,000 ft isntead.  I would love to give the AI co-pilot the boot for ignoring all ATC instructions.

At the end of the second flight, the AI co-pilot overshot the airport (Dubai International, OMDB) because the aircraft was far too high, so the AI co-pilot then had to execute a missed approach but managed to crash the plane into the sea off the Dubai coast (which left me very disappointed and very underwhelmed) because he was far too late in bringing the landing wheels down and I had great difficulty in trying to pull the landing wheel down in the cockpit.

WIth the third flight which was at Singapore Changi (WSSS), the AI co-pilot managed to overshoot the airport again, had to go round and then around again to land into the airport but the AI co-pilot managed to miss the glidepath to the arrival runway, landing the aircraft on grass instead of the runway, managing to run over two stationary ""follow me"" trucks before they were forced to move off (the aircraft also narrowly missed running over a moving van that was moving along the runway when the aircraft was taxiing to a parking gate.

That was it.  MS FS 2020 is further evidence that all Microsh*t / Microscam / Micro$$$$$$$$$ software will all always be typical Microsh*t / Microscam / Micro$$$$$$$$$$ crapware, especially with the latest Windows 10 Insider Preview (version 20H2) being yet more evidence of Microsh*t / Microscam / Micro$$$$$$$$$$ crapware.  MS FS 2020 is one big fat complete lemon, like X-Plane, not worth the ¬£109.99 for the premium edition, because the people at Asorbo Studio are very clearly not the brightest lightbulbs on the face of the planet because the standard of their ""development"" is just very mediocre and very average.

In addition, there is no way of loading / unloading passengers, loading / unloading baggage and cargo, no way of allowing cleaners and caterers aboard to clean the aircraft and replenish the catering trolleys, no
way of loading fuel and no way of connecting / disconnecting ground power which would have made for
far more realistic experience, and there is also no way of loading / unloading passengers, loading / unloading baggage / cargo, no way of allowing cleaners and caterars aboard, and also no way of loading fuel in all
pilot checklists.  Why?

The minimum hardware reqirements for MS FS 2020 is very demanding, very unreasonable and very excessive.  If you do not have the latest hardware spec required to run MS FS 2020, just forget it.

That is the end of my ""adventure"" with MS FS 2020.  I have been conned and ripped off, and I now hate Microsh*t / Microscam / Micro$$$$$$$$.  The people at Microsh*t / Microscam / Micro$$$$$$$ all are very clearly brain-dead idiots.

Plus all updates all always fail to be installed, these updates always take ages to download, you do not get any indications which needs to be downloaded and installed and which doesn't because they have all been already downloaded and installed, the game doesn't even tell you, and these updates that fail to be downloaded and installed, the main reason is that you need this specific piece of software, the latest version build, but the game doesn't even tell you what version has been downloaded and installed, and the game also doesn't even tell you where to get whatever piece of software which is needed to make a particular update work properly.

MSFS is just complete rubbish and a sheer waste of time and money.  A big rip-off by the mediocre half-wit crooks at Asobo who obviously have caca for brains.

First and foremost, the graphics in Microsoft Flight Simulator are simply stunning. The level of detail in the landscapes, cities, and aircraft is truly awe-inspiring. From towering skyscrapers to lush forests and serene coastlines, the world feels alive and realistic. The weather effects, including rain, snow, and fog, only enhance the visual spectacle, making each flight feel like a true adventure.

One of the standout features of this simulator is the vastness of its world. With a data-driven platform, you can explore the entire globe with astonishing accuracy. From busy international airports to remote airstrips in the middle of nowhere, the world is your oyster. Whether you want to fly over your hometown or embark on a cross-continental journey, the possibilities are endless.

I have 1150 hrs in FSX:SE, flying nothing but PMDG Study Level Aircraft. I am not a pilot, just enjoy simming it. When it was announced that Microsoft was rebooting the franchise from the disaster that was DTG, I was super stoked for a 64 bit rendition of the game‚Ä¶because let‚Äôs be honest, that‚Äôs what it is. A game! 

FSX was great, but we‚Äôve all been there‚Ä¶you know, on final approach after sitting at the computer for a non-time compressed flight, across the Pacific from Sydney to Los Angeles‚Ä¶and then ‚ÄúBoom‚Äù‚Ä¶CTD! Thank God FSX crashed more than planes do in real life, because that would suck bad‚Ä¶real bad. But tell that to my saddle sore backside after an 18 hour flight, only to have it CTD on the last 5 to 10 minutes‚Ä¶in my mind it may as well be real.

So, in the 1st days of MSFS 2020, truly in the 1st days, I was a good little sheep and bought the ‚ÄúPremium Deluxe‚Äù version. Spent the hours and hours of installation on those early days, I think it was 3 hours or more with the fastest internet in Canada. I started it up and it seemed ok, I tried a half hearted flight from Denver to Cheyenne, in a little single engine turbo prop, but as there were no PMDG products available (I hate Airbus), I put it aside.

I patiently waited as PMDG and MSFS worked out whatever issues continued to plague the 737, and when I felt the time was right, I bought the PMDG 737-800. But, I also needed‚Ä¶LOL‚Ä¶ ‚Äúneeded‚Äù the TCA Boeing Yoke & Throttle Quadrant ( I already had a perfectly good Logitech Yoke and Throttle Quadrant, as well as Rudders) and the Logitech Radio panels and Multi Panel to compliment my Switch Panel. I spent a lot of $$$ to be hooked up and running again. My last flight was more than 2 years ago, in FSX, and you guessed it‚Ä¶CTD on descent, after flying across the Atlantic! 

All the pundits went on and on‚Ä¶and on and on‚Ä¶about how GREAT MSFS 2020 is.

Fast Forward to 3 days into flying in MSFS‚Ä¶I have had more CTD in MSFS than I did in my last 20 flights with FSX. I have to run the game on the lowest settings, and it‚Äôs not like my machine is a crappy machine. My CPU is only at 4 to 5%, my VRam is at 49%, my RAM is at 41% and I was getting a decent 49 FPS throttled at 60 FPS and 60Hz refresh on two monitors capable of 165 each. However, my GPU kept spiking over 85% and at points into the 90‚Äôs, and I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs what crashed it every time. I have an RTX 3060 with 12GB VRAM‚Ä¶now I know that‚Äôs not the BEST card, but it‚Äôs well above the recommended specs for the game. I have a Ryzen 7 3700X 3.59GHz and 32 GB of RAM.

Back to the Pundits‚Ä¶You all have never flown in FSX obviously, because if you have/had you would realize that the following is TRUE:

-Who gives a crap about the level of detail of flora and fauna, boats and cars when you are at FL370  (wasted PC resources)‚Ä¶are you driving a F****** Car? No! You‚Äôre flying a plane!
- ASOBO basically copied everything from FSX and put LIPSTICK on THIS PIG!
- The AI Traffic is still just as S***** as it was in FSX
- The ATC is still just as S***** as it was in FSX (except now they don‚Äôt yell at you for flying a STAR approach, and you don‚Äôt need to use Edit Voicepack to get a VR Airline Name in the game)
- ATC makes you stop randomly during Taxi, when no one is around, or they make you wait endlessly behind a Cessna Skyhawk, that looks to be stalled on the Taxiway‚Ä¶Utter Bulls***!
- Even the airports for the most part are not completely updated (ahem!cough!sputter! CYVR, cough! ASOBO, there are more metropolitan cities in Canada than just Toronto) and if you do happen to purchase some DLC Airports, after the game CTD‚Äôs, on restart it‚Äôs going to tell you to make the community folder inactive‚Ä¶Why? If you made the game NOT so S***** in the 1st place, then maybe we, ‚ÄúTHE CUSTOMERS‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt need a computer that can run NASA, just to use the DLC that you shill on the Market Place‚Ä¶My guess is that you saw how wonderfully this works for DTG and Train Simulator, and decided to follow the road map.
- Whose stupid idea was it to STREAM the World over an internet connection, rather than have the files local on hard disk, saving possibly money in DATA and not having to rely on internet connections‚Ä¶because EVERYONE at some point has internet issues. What? Did ASOBO buy stock in AOL? I‚Äôd much rather have it all on my hard drive. I don‚Äôt see what was so terrible about the FSX world system. FSX allowed you to deactivate parts of the world that you were not flying in, essentially limiting RAM and CPU usage‚Ä¶I see you didn‚Äôt learn anything in 10 years.

- The only PRO I can find so far is the realistic Runways, unfortunately I can‚Äôt see them because my settings are too low, but I can feel them.

And finally, and possibly my biggest beef‚Ä¶No FS Passenger‚Ä¶oh the screams, the screams‚Ä¶and the money!!! I really miss the stewardess barging into the cockpit to tell me about the passenger in 4c with the rash‚Ä¶and who could forget that bloody light penalty, or the Radar gun that clocked you doing 254kts under 10k‚Ä¶oh what fun!...Oh OK...that's NOT ASOBO's fault...but, in my defense, they did basically take every great FSX Addon and implement it into the game..so why not FS Passenger...so it IS ASOBO's fault...LOL

In Conclusion, if you‚Äôre looking for a sim‚Ä¶don‚Äôt waste the money. They have already stated that they are abandoning MSFS 2020 and building a new one MSFS 2024. Unless you are committed to buying ALL the big shiny new computer parts‚Ä¶your system will probably not run this game as it is intended to run.

I just finished weighing the costs of purchasing a new Simulator(P3D) and replacing ALL of my PMDG aircraft from FSX and adding one, against the cost of an RTX 4070 Ti (not including new power supply) and The new sim and replacement planes comes in at $115 cheaper. It seems to me, that only having ‚ÄúReal Runways‚Äù as an advantage, doesn‚Äôt justify the cost of MSFS 2020, it certainly isn‚Äôt worth $115. Let alone the $160 CDN price tag for the game.

Internet searches show many others have had this problem but Microsoft have not sorted this out since the end of October (2020) and multiple complaints. 

The developer website (Xbox) has literally 'thousands' of trouble shooting posts. One single CTDs error post has 44K views? IS THIS NORMAL???

It loads the adverts, then asks for me to set up an Xbox live account but wont let me click on anything, it will sit like that for hours if I leave it. I uninstalled it and reinstalled it (taking all night and some of the next day to download) but it's exactly the same. Tried again some months later, still the same.  I've tried various fixes from internet sources but so far nothing has worked. MONTHS of fault finding. I give up! I requested a refund but Steam WON'T refund as I've played it for over two hours, even though the first 12 hours were the installation program running, (I spent ¬£79 on this game by the way)! The updates and loading time show as play time on Steam which is completely pointless. I'm not going to stop fighting to get my money back even though I'm already feeling the might of such a large company pushing me back, ¬£79 down the flipping drain. I've contacted Microsoft too but am still waiting for some communication. To say I'm not happy is an understatement. This is the first Microsoft game I've bought in a few years, and I WON'T be buying any more. This game has regular updates that seem to bugger up installations with absolutely no comeback on Microsoft. There are multiple examples on the internet of people with game issues. I would like Steam to send more feedback to Microsoft or even stop hosting this game all together. I've been waiting 14 years for the remake of FSX and I thought this was it! Sadly not. I'm so disappointed in this product. Even when it was working it had multiple flaws, like it isn't finished. The loading times are a joke, (and I've got a ¬£1200 Gaming PC). 5 to 10 minutes to load, then if you want to change world location or aircraft you have to do that 5-10 mins all over again. At maximum graphics settings it looks great and pushes my PC to the limit but sadly it does not run smoothly, it stutters/pauses randomly. I've lowered the graphics to the lowest settings but it still pauses. I have other more demanding games that do run smoothly, it doesn't make sense. Some aircraft could have more buttons that actually do something. There seems to be less actionable buttons in this version than FSX. The playability is good by how you look around the cockpit, but I never had much of a problem with that before. The world terrain photo scenery is good but FSX had add on scenery that was good 14 years ago! Sorry, but I've just had far too many problems in FS2020 and the fact that now it doesn't work at all, that I cant recommend this game.

Upgraded that with the tileproxy. Actually got it to look pretty damn good. Closer to msfs2020 then the dev's care to admit. This is mostly down to bing maps being pretty mehh, when compared to other mapservices out there. Then for me came P3D with PMDG add-on planes. Now that was a treat. FLying the big birds. Airacs, SIDs and STARS. flightplans. REX. great flying to be had.  And then came MSFS2020. I was hyped. Everything we loved about FSX. But now better. looked amazing. And the talk about improving the flightmodel to something that has a bit more fluidity to it, instead of the ""on rails"" experience. Count me in I thought. Install was a breeze. But then..ohhhh boy,then the updating starts. Hours on hours worth of updating. And then the biggest disapointment. This is not a simulator. It's an X-box console arcade game looking like a flightsim. But dumbed down so thata 14 year old with a controller on an x-box can have a good time aswell. ( which is fine when you are a, lets say, 14 year old with an x-box controller ) But not when you are a 30+ year experience flightsim buff who would like a challenge. The planes are somtimes outright uncontrolable because of weird things going on in the flightmodel. ( looking at you A320 ) complete loss of elevator authority for no appearent reason. Adventure flights not registering landings. Or even worse. Showing empty nav logs. Meaning you can't finish the challenges. Endless updating. every time I think I would like to give this a try after a few months. It tells me I need to install some other patch. These are not small either. Just sat through a 9 Gigabyte patch. Meanwhile having to listen to this song droning on in the background. Why can't this game quitely update in the background. While I am bussy doing meaningfull stuff, without being bothered by the game. The previous time something was changed, and all of a sudden I could not click on things in the cockpit. After searching on forums, I found I had to go in a menu somewhere, and put a setting back to classic. Then it worked again. Again flying experience is subpar. Graphics that looked fine all of a sudden got ""optimezed"" And now it looks like someone has gone to town on all glass surfaces with a pencill, crosshatching it all in. reminds me of the old CGA graffics days. But then everything was magenta and cyan. And tonight, the final insult. Firt after the update the game refused to go to full screen. And buttons were not registering where the mouse hoovered. had to shut the game down because it froze. When I restarted, the game stated that it crashed earlyer, and that this was probably down to third party software. ( pointing fingers right away are we Asobo/Microsoft? ) Shamefull. nd then the final insult. It will not let me controll my aircraft. Again all the settings are gone and or reversed. But now I cannot move my aircraft. I see the throttle indicator move in de overlay hud in 3rd person view. But nothing happens. The game is frozen. I hear the engine running but nothing happens. ( I checked active pause..that is not it ) So now it has literally for the umptienth time become. UNFLYABLE!! This is the best looking piece of crap I have seen in a long time.  But a flightsimulater it is not. It is an update en fumble and try and restore your controll settings simulator. I paid full price for this what is a shame. It was actually better before they started updating the game. It has literally become unplayable. Maybe this is only on PC. But is an utter disgrace. I have not written many reviews. But here I feel I have to warn people. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!! Please, install DCS. It's free. It flies like a dream. Looks fantastic. has proper aerodynamics going on. And if you are done with the SU-25 and P51. Get yourself the F18 on discount. And enjoy what a real working flight simulater feels like. This pile of shit is a complete waste of your time.

~edit august 2023~ 
This just keeps getting worse and worse.10 gig update. 
All progression in lessons is gone. So I have to start that from scratch. Couple of basic steps into the first familiarization lesson. The lesson requires me to ""hide"" the yoke by pointing at the yoke, and pressing cockpit primary control lockable. No clue what that means. So i go to control settings, and find out that this key is not configured yet. Why Microsoft/Asobo, do you not make sure that buttons we need in our first lesson are at least configured. Then comes the job of selecting a particular button to press for this action. But then it tells you all most of the keys are allready assigned. I am already fed up with this. And why can't you spin the friggin globe on the worldmap!!!  The world means more then north america!!  Try and select an airfield in norway. Then just tried to fly the landing challenges.  I had this all on 100% and all A's. But now they added flights again. So now I need to fly some new ones.  Sure. No problem. First one. easy landings. Should be a piece of cake. Flight comes on in the dark. With a master caution on, and no primairy flight display. So I have no clue as to how fast I am going. ohh my word...this game. it is so broken. It literally throws everything at you to prevent you from actually flying the game and completing the challenges. Came back to see if anything changed. It is still not ok. And then the worst part is...they allready announced MSFS2024.  So now all of us that have 3rd party software are in for a treat.  We get to find out if our stuf works in the next iteration???  But with this trackrecord, I highly advise against getting MSFS2024 early.  Big disappointment.",1648841880,1692125790,False,4,0,0.529392659664154053,0,True,False,False

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.",1609140280,1692107283,True,0,0,0.459841340780258179,0,True,False,False

Stunning scenery, even on low settings, real live traffic, a living breathing world, real time weather and, if your internet connection can handle it, streamed ground textures. Wow!
However, there are some bugs, like ATC not working properly.

But...................recently Microsoft/Asobo introduced FS2024, so all their actual promises of 10 years of continuous development have virtually gone out the window for FS2020. I can't see them splitting their teams in half to work on both sims, as is apparent with the lack of recent fixes, and indeed more bugs have been introduced with every update.

Changing my review to Negative because it sucks that I can't play the game that I paid for.

Bought the basic version on sale. I don't care about realism at all, but the detailed map is great for aerial tourism. I keep all the assists on, damage and fuel off, and just go hover around sightseeing all the places I've been in life. I just fly the Volocopter (quadcopter thing) - super slow but the computer makes it super easy to just hover in one spot - when sightseeing buildings etc up close. I fly the F-18 Hornet when I want something faster. Lots of fun and I'm going to bring my computer with me to show my friends and family the aerial views of the various places we've been to.

Others have covered the downsides - It's like a 50 GB Steam download to start, then it downloads another 150 GB with a non-functional progress bar. Then in-game you still want/need a fast internet connection to stream detailed map data, and Microsoft's servers suck and constantly give ""disconnected"" errors. Also you need at least a current mid-tier desktop PC to even run it at minimum settings, and you also need a Microsoft account. Also the game is technically playable with an xbox controller and I use one for my sightseeing flights in the Volocopter and Hornet just fine, but you'll want a real cockpit HOTAS setup if you're going to fly the big planes or try turning the assists off / damage on etc.

Even after all those annoyances it's still worth it - seems like the closest thing to your own personal helicopter tour ($$$$$), from the comfort of your couch",1689438435,1692056526,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

it's good, not great.
best at what it is sure, but huge dl's and a bad pre-game interface don't help one bit.

1 - You only install the launcher on steam. This means, you'll have to gain playtime just by installing the actual game, making it impossible to refund the game once it's actually installed, due to steam's 2 hour policy.

2 - The installation process is extremely annoying, with it having a high chance of corrupting mid-way.
The method I used to fix this, was to press ""Windows + R"", type ""%appdata%"", go to ""C:\Users\XXXX\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft Flight Simulator\Packages\Official\Steam"", right click and sort by date modified. Then simply delete fs-base files, restart the PC and start the download again.

The download also tends to break whenever windows defender has Real-Time-Protection enabled.

While these problems are extremely frustrating, especially because they happen right after opening the launcher, being able to play the game and putting hours after hours into it is absolutely worth it.",1691858258,1691937666,True,0,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Being able to fly over real cities and real landmarks and land on real airports with realistic weather is incredible.  Lots of fun activities.  Amazing graphics if you have the system to push it.  One of the best VR experiences available, the cockpits are very realistic.  A lot of DLC.

The bad - You have to log into the game to download most of the content.  This includes large world scenery updates, airports, traffic, and aircraft.  Would be nice if you could just automatically download all your DLC like most every other Steam game.  With the amount of world updates, and the fact you have to select them in-game means this game sometimes feels like download simulator.  MS said the next version of Flight Simulator will have better missions and support for multi-threading and I am wondering why they aren't providing that for this product.  It isn't like multi-core CPU's are new and we had some pretty awesome missions in past versions of the product, Flight Sim X especially.

Other - Setting up my CH Product HOTAS caused many blue screens of death on Win 11 pro.  I am pretty sure these crashes were due to the default inputs being replicated across devices, so the throttle and fighterstick had many buttons doing the same thing.  I was eventually able to get the buttons sorted and the blue screens stopped but it was pretty painful going through multiple reboots to do it.  Game also randomly crashes every so often but seems like every MS Flight Sim I have owned has done that.

When this game works, it's great. It looks stunning, sounds amazing, and can be genuinely immersive.

Unfortunately, I only have a 1 in 5 success rate on getting to actually play the game when I want to. Either the game needs a 40GB update (which takes 4 hours to install even on a 500Mb internet, because the update system is dreadfully slow) or the game just Crashes to Desktop when I try fly, which tends to be the result of an update that got botched. Which means I have to delete the content folder, and re-install, which genuinely takes most of the day.

There is one important thing that is basically not stated anywhere - you cannot use Steam functionality to move MSFS installation to another discs. It is because aside from one 2Gb general content all content like Mandatory updates, Word updates and your purchased content is installed via game client and not via Steam. So if you try to move MSFS installation to another disc, Steam moves only that 2Gb general content - and delete everything that was on original disc.
So you have to re-download everything, which might be a lot of data.So if you plan to move MSFS installation to another disc, do not use Steam function for this, but instead look for some video or article where is explained how to do that and how to avoid reinstalling everything again.

I have used Steam to move the MSGS files and now I have to re-download everything, which on my 10 megabit wi-fi will take ages.

I don't blame Steam for that, they just move the content they install, I blame Microsoft for not putting a warning somewhere and not providing instructions how to do it properly, if they decided to go with their own installer.


[h1]Update[/h1]

VR was released so it is time to update my review. I am playing with Oculus Rift and HOTAS. So far FS does not support motion controls, which are, at least from my experience with X-plane horrible way how to fly but for others it might be a huge setback.

From my point of view everything in VR is done right or at least acceptable. Swithches are operated by mouse similar to DS and windows can be positioned anywhere in the sphere around you similar to Flyinside. Both systems works very good and I am glad that Asobo did not try to reinvent the wheel and used them.

What is not so comfortable is, that mouse cursor has some 3d aspect and is in front of the switches and when properly positioned it somehow attaches to them. In DS the mouse cursos does not have this aspect and ""touching"" the switches is more smooth.
Another annoying issue is that currently is not possible to map trims into axis. But I suppose that this will be fixed, because it should be considered as a must have option for every simulator.

But back to the VR - performance wise you need a powerful rig, there is no doubt about it and if you do not play on bitcoin miner you will also spend some time with tuning the option, but given how awesome FS looks  it runs surprisingly good. With sacrificing resolution and details and setting up specific profile in card setting I now have very smooth performance almost without micro stuttering. I would say that performance is close to DC and definitely much batter than X-plane (but I didn't try X-plane with Vulcan, it might perform much better).

When playng in VR I recommend to read some MSFS performance tuning articles and try it yourself, you probably will be able to get at least slightly better performance. And some settings, like Windows accelerated GPU scheduling might be a real game changer.

[h1]Highlights[/h1]

There are many awesome aspects of MSFS  but one recently added featuretook my breath away. They added actual snow coverage, so if snow is melting in your country exposing parts of ground while other places are still covered by snow you will see the same in game and if there is total snow coverage, same goes also for your virtual flying.  And it is not just ground texture, also vegetation has winter models and I have to say I was blown away when I saw it.

Lots of ground features are really amazing, like bridges, tunnels, windmills and many more. Also vegetation coverage seems to be spot on, I have landed on the meadow behind our house, and the line of trees along the road, edge of the forest, few trees around the lake and simply everything was spot on.

[h1]Warning[/h1]

First of all, MSFS is a huge game and problem is, that it is not installed via Steam, but via Game Client. And running the game client counts as playing the game so you will probably have several hours of game time just before you download the game. As far as I know Steam is aware of that and you can refund it anyway, but be warned and do not rely on that.

[h1]General conclusion[/h1]

Buy if
- you want beautiful landscape, weather and generally all the eye candy for your VFR flights
- have relatively powerful rack and and not absolutely horrible internet connection
- you are ok with small amount of default planes and poor support from 3rd party developers
- you are ok that VR version is still in beta

Do not buy if
- you are easily annoyed by Microsoft business model and it's attitude towards 3rd party developers
- you are expecting plenty of high quality 3rd party content
- you prefer to fly heavy metal, military jets, warbirds, floatplanes etc.

Generally this is  something what we have been waiting for almost a decade and now we have to hope that Microsoft will not let it die, because no sim can thrive without the support of 3rd party developers, no matter how great the base game is",1606496383,1690879367,True,2,0,0.543859660625457764,0,True,False,False

Edit after about 30h of playtime:

The game is fun when it works. However there are constant little problems especially with the mouse (at least in VR. Haven't tried without). The cursor on many parts of most aircraft ends up *behind* the surface of the instrument panels so i have to close my right eye and ""aim"" the cursor with the left because it's not in focus anymore.
The cursor bugs out in other ways too, both in the cockpit and in the menus. Very often clicking a button/switch doesn't do anything and i have to click away from the thing that i'm trying click to ""reset?"" something. Sometimes it helps. Sometimes it doesn't and i have to go back to a previous menu, or click a different window or something.
The knobs are SUPER weird at times. 
Sometimes they work fine. Sometimes the knob only goes so far or even starts to rotate the other way and you have to repeatedly grab it again to move it another 30 degrees or so.
Sometimes trying to adjust the knob with the mouse freezes the game completely until you let go of it and only works if you adjust it with the scroll wheel.

Responding to ATC tower with number keys simply doesn't work. I have to take my hand off the stick to click on the response options with my mouse, which kills the immersion and puts the aircraft in a death spiral. (mostly because i'm lazy at trimming the plane though.)

Trying to trim the aircraft with an axis on my stick is a death sentence. The trim holds for a while, but sometimes ""forgets"" it and sends it to 20degrees which instantly stalls the plane.
Don't use any axis on your HOTAS for trims.

Running the game in VR requires either tolerance for reprojetion and pixelation or deep pockets for a RTX 4090 and an i9 13900 (or both if you really like pretty graphics and legible instruments like me)
You might get the performance to tolerable levels with time tinkering in the settings.
There are tutorials on the internet that help if you don't know the precise performance hit of each individual setting like me.

Now that FS24 is coming, i think that they'll put much effort into fixing the 2020 version.
Unless you don't mind endlessly tinkering with settings and fighting bugs, i can't recommend the game. I only got this because i don't have enough patience or self control to wait for FS24..",1690012360,1690741465,False,1,0,0.47413790225982666,0,True,False,False

Remarkable engineering masterpiece.
The best non-military flight simulator.
Casual game about airplanes and detailed aircraft simulator in one game.
Must-have for all aviation enthusiasts, good choice for travellers waiting for their next trip.

[h1]Idea[/h1]
Sandbox focused on airplanes. Real-scale, real world, real machines. You are the pilot, and the world is yours to explore.

[h1]Story[/h1]
There is no real story in this game. You need to rely on your own imagination to decide what to do next.
The closest thing to a story mode in are the ""Bush Trips"". These are scenarios that require you to follow written directions to travel from one point to another. These missions are located in places around the world that offer beautiful views.

[h1]World[/h1]
You can go anywhere in the world and configure time and weather. Watch a sunrise from the cockpit of an airliner, or test your skills in a tiny propeller-driven plane during a thunderstorm. The possibilities are endless, and you are in control.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Most of the time in the game is spent in free mode, where you can choose an aircraft and spawn at any location. There are other game modes, such as landing challenges, bush trips, and discovery flights, but overall, the game does not offer a robust progression system.

However, the main activity of flying an airplane is very immersive. In each aircraft, most of the switches are operable and have an impact on the flight.

If the plane has an autopilot, you can use it. It may take some time to learn, but it is a very satisfying skill to use in the game.

Navigation in the game is also realistic. You can use the navigation radio for instrumented flight, including the Instrumented Landing System.

A software development kit (SDK) is available for this game. You can use it to write your own program to control the plane, integrate external hardware, and more. The SDK offers almost unlimited extensibility.

[h1]Graphics and Sound[/h1]
This game is beautiful. The graphics and sound are amazing. Running it on ultra settings requires decent hardware, but it is absolutely worth it.

Letting the plane fly on autopilot and just looking around is a joy. Raindrops, reflections, clouds, forests, seas, and cities all look amazing. Some objects even have actual 3D models.

[h1]Replayability[/h1]
You can come back to it anytime you feel like flying. It never gets boring.

[h1]Pros[/h1]
- Represents the real world accurately.
- Provides detailed aircraft models.
- Simulates autopilot and navigation systems.
- Offers an SDK for creating extensions.

[h1]Cons[/h1]
- Has only a simple achievements system with no micro-achievements.
- Lacks engaging scenarios.

Microsoft Flight Simulator is a breathtaking masterpiece that has redefined the way we experience virtual aviation. As an aviation enthusiast, this game has been an absolute dream come true for me, delivering an unparalleled flight simulation that rivals reality itself.

From the moment you launch the game, you'll be awestruck by the attention to detail and the sheer scale of the world that awaits you. The graphics are nothing short of stunning, with realistic landscapes, cities, and landmarks that make you feel like you're flying over the real thing. Whether it's soaring through the majestic Alps, skimming over New York City's skyline, or navigating the intricate maze of fjords in Norway, the level of realism is simply astounding.

The flight mechanics are incredibly accurate, making every takeoff, landing, and maneuver a true-to-life challenge. It's not just about pushing buttons and pulling levers; you'll need to consider weather conditions, aircraft weight, and other factors that real pilots face. The attention to detail extends to the aircraft themselves, each meticulously modeled with functioning systems and authentic cockpit layouts. Whether you're flying a tiny Cessna or a massive Boeing 747, the experience is deeply immersive.

One of the standout features of Microsoft Flight Simulator is the live weather system, which uses real-world weather data to simulate conditions. Flying through a thunderstorm with turbulent winds and dark clouds overhead is both thrilling and nerve-wracking, while clear skies and gentle sunsets are truly serene. The dynamic time of day and seasonal changes further enhance the realism, making each flight unique and rewarding.

Beyond the remarkable single-player experience, the online mode adds a whole new dimension to the game. Flying alongside other real players in a shared world creates a sense of camaraderie and excitement, and you can even team up for group flights or air races. The thriving community also provides an abundance of user-created content, from new aircraft and liveries to custom-made airports that expand the game even further.

As with any complex simulation, there is a learning curve, but the game provides an excellent set of tutorials and assists to ease newcomers into the world of flight. With time and practice, you'll find yourself mastering the art of flight and developing a deep appreciation for the skill and precision required by real pilots.",1690609648,1690609697,True,0,1,0,2,True,False,False

If you are interested in aviation (generally airplanes) MSFS is a very good flight simulator. In the game you will find planes for sale, many of which have really good graphics. But you should first think about whether it is worth the money for it. I recommend watching a video about the plane beforehand to see if this plane is really worth buying. Of course, tastes are different and I definitely don't advise against not buying the plane now, if you're having fun and want to buy you the plane, you're welcome to do so, because as long as it's fun everything is fine and that's what we want. In summary, MSFS2020 is a very, very good game and also beginner-friendly. In my opinion a top game and definitely worth the money. (also included in the Xbox game pass)

As a result, you are guaranteed to be ineligible for a refund by the time you can actually play the game, because all that download time IS COUNTED AS PLAY TIME BY STEAM, so you're over your two hours before you ever actually play. This is an unethical dodge that prevents any possibility of getting your money back unless you realize this before you finish the download. I consider it fraudulent and criminal.

Plus, downloads get more and more likely to be corrupted as they get larger. There will be more starts and stops, more interruptions, and each one is a fresh chance for corruption--software corruption, not the kind I talked about first--to creep in, forcing you to start over once you finally think you're done with it. I have no doubt it will take me multiple attempts to download this massive white elephant... and since I fell for Microsoft's refund dodge, I have no choice if I want to get anything out of it.

For shame, Microsoft.

Update:

Most of the ""86 hours"" I've spent on this game has been purely downloading that initial 120 gigabytes. Yeah, I have a slower connection than most. That's still absurd. So, I have only a couple hours of actual flight time. Issues so far:

*Opening any menu sets my pitch trim all the way down. My plane goes into an immediate nosedive and I crash. Haven't found any way to avoid it, so every flight has to be continuous, with NO use of the menus, NO adjusting controls, nothing, or I crash.

*Sometimes my plane goes into an inexplicable nosedive anyway. Velocity's fine. Controls are fine. Suddenly boom, nosedive, won't respond when I try to pull up, and I crash.

*Sometimes my controls just refuse to respond from the start, and I can't get off the runway. Nothing seems to be wrong, it just won't fly.

DO NOT try to say there's something wrong with my controller (X-56 Rhino.) No other game does this; my controller is fine. The game is messed up. Period.

This game is seriously broken, which is probably why they play games to make sure you can't refund it. DO NOT BUY.",1689315613,1690050733,False,49,13,0.71258169412612915,0,True,False,False

[b]Preface[/b]

For 3 years since the release of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, I have faced a mountain of criticism of the game. After 3 years, I can say with confidence that this is the best flight simulator for your comfortable game today.

[b]One big minus of the Steam version[/b]

If you buy the Steam version of this game, you can immediately forget about the refund ‚Äî in fact, you are buying a launcher through which you download the game. It will not be possible to return it. But I'm sure you won't want to :)

[b]Incomparable advantages of the game in comparison with other flight simulators[/b]

The biggest plus, as you know, is the graphics. For 3 years, so many additions and improvements have been released that screenshots with ultra graphics are almost indistinguishable from reality. In addition, there is an AI in the game, which is the most trained of all the AI in flight simulators (because there are none in other simulators, ahah).

[b]Disadvantages[/b]

Prepare your wallets ‚Äî after buying the game for comfortable flights, you will have to buy a few more planes and at least a few airports from the community. In addition, it would be worth buying a number of additions like well-developed regional traffic and improvements for graphics at standard airports.

[b]Response to standard criticism[/b]

I constantly hear about three main claims against MSFS. Let's analyze each of them.
1) [u]Problems with physics[/u]. Often these claims are made by adherents of X-Plane and Prepar3D, who for some reason decided that in their simulators the physics is close to ideal. Not really. MSFS has normal physics, don't listen to them.
2) [u]There are no planes[/u]. The claim was relevant in the first year after the simulator was released, now the community has developed a lot of cool and detailed aircraft.
3) [u]Too expensive[/u]. No, it's normal for a game of this level.

[b]Is it worth buying in 2023?[/b]

Microsoft recently announced the release of Flight Simulator 2024. I do not rule out that the new game will face the same problems that were at the release of the 2020 version. In the next few years, MSFS 2020 will remain the best flight simulator available on the market. By all means buy if you want to fly with a beautiful picture and pleasure. And you won't have to suffer with installing plugins, hello, X-Plane, with which I have suffered.

P.S. Do not buy a version higher than the standard one, spend this money on add-ons :)",1690032292,1690032292,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is just about the best flight simulator money can buy and truly represents the cutting edge of the medium. However, there are a couple massive caveats to my praise, namely performance and new user friendliness. To be totally forthcoming I did not play much of the game due to the technical limitations of my set-up (i7-10700, 6650 XT, 32GB DDR4) so keep in mind that I am coming with limited knowledge of all the gameplay features.

[h1]Performance and Optimization[/h1]
Make no mistake, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 is [b]by far[/b] the worst optimized game I've ever played. I am not exaggerating when I say that my GPU pulling upwards of 110 degrees Celsius in game (it might've gone higher if I hadn't force quitted the app to avoid heat damage). My graphics were set to medium for the entire time though I experimented with higher and lower settings during separate sessions. My game crashed many times throughout and it has the longest load up time of any game I own despite the fact that I am loading it off a modern SSD. A lot of these performance issues I could've chalked up to the revolutionary features and insane graphical capacity of MSFS [i]if[/i] it hadn't been for the fact that my GPU temps starts to climb into the high 90s while still on the main menu.

I eventually had to uninstall the game because I simply was not having fun and the over 100GB it took up on my hard drive was preventing me from downloading games I actually want to play. This is unfortunate as I was really excited to play it, yet the abysmal framerate and threat it posed to my GPU's health were deal-breakers.

[h1]Accessibility to New Players[/h1]
While I appreciate the commitment to realism I also wish that a more user friendly approach was taken with the default control scheme. It is jarring for players new to the franchise and very clearly shows the intended audience of developers to be focused on the hardcore simmers with multi-thousand dollar flight sim peripherals. I do have to give credit where credit is due though, the tutorial is quite comprehensive and helpful, if a little long. A variety of other factors play into the intimidation factor for new players (the 12+ hour installation process upon first-time start-up for one) and to be honest that is mostly do to the nature of these hyper-realistic simulators. Still, there are things the devs could have done to appeal to a wider audience while not detracting from the hardcore experience that veteran simmers crave.

[h1]Overall Score and Conclusion[/h1]
If you are a airplane fanatic with a large disposable income for a top-of-the-line pc and peripherals, this is the game for you, there simply is no comparison. However, if you are a casual player with sensible mid-range hardware who is either looking for an introduction to flight sims or is wanting a casual flying experience, this simply not the game for you. For these reasons I can't recommend in good faith to the general gaming community though I still give it a solid 7.5/10 overall.",1689956140,1689956140,False,2,0,0.497942358255386353,1,True,False,False

MSFS had the opportunity to truly become the best flight simulator of all time (and by default, it is the best civilian flight simulator). However it seems that Asobo and/or Microsoft are refusing to adress core issues in the game and prefer adding shallow content.
Before getting into the details, I have to say, MSFS is great in many ways. Its photorealistic terrain generation make for an amazing visual experience (in the summer time at least), the ""CFD"" they brag about seems to be working well and most importantly, the community of third-party devellopers for aircrafts, systems and scenery give the game its purpose.
But it somehow stops there. The game is in most aspects very bad :
- The launcher: it looks like it was put together in a hurry and never revised. I, and everyone I know, had to reinstall the game at some point because of bugs in the launcher, during a 150Gb download.
- The Multiplayer: this feature (or lack of feature) is ridiculous, for a game that sold itself on its multiplayer. This is the extent of MSFS's multiplayer: you can see in the world everyone that checked the option to be seen. And that's it. There is no model matching (you will see your friends in the correct plane only if it the same as yours, otherwise it is replaced by one of the lowpoly ugly fictionnal planes from the game), there is no matching of animation (gear position, flaps, etc), no collisions and worst of all, if your friend comes close to your plane, they simply disapear, making close formation flying impossible. Also, the netcode is terrible.
- Ground handling: Ground handling feels terrible, there is no real simulation of the ground. It is hard to describe.
- Water: There is no water, water is just ground you can sort of sink into. It can roll on water. This makes seaplane unusable, which is weird for a sim that keeps putting out ads and content about seaplane.
- General feeling: There is a general lack of directness in the simulation. Every input feels like it is dampened by the game and you feel weirdly disconnected from the plane. It is hard to wrap my head around this but the feeling is there and it makes flying with stick and rudder in MSFS sometimes disapointing, as good as the flight model can be.

I will stop my list there but there are still a lot of core feature that make the game look like an unfinished product. And the real problem here is the fact the dev seem to never adress this. Every update is about content and nothing is done to adress core issues. I wish asobo would focus on MSFS as a plateform and leave the content to third parties (Aircraft and Scenery). 
Microsoft just announced MSFS 2024 which seems to only improve on the already good terrain generation (not complaining, I just think there are other priorities) and more content. Let's hope Asobo improves the core experience with this.

After saying al that, I still recommend this game, and I will continue playing it because third party dev put out amazing work to make the experience interresting and it also the best you can get for civilian flight simulation. 
To those who want a taste of what great flight simulation can be, Eagle Dynamics' DCS World is free to try and is to me the best experience you can get on your PC.",1689928835,1689931740,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Two years in, and I still have to rate this game down. It is a visual spectacle and achievement, I have to give them that. But as a piece of software, as a game, as a flight simulator, as everything else other than being Google Earth with airplanes, it is a complete disaster. Most of the airplanes are not even close to their real world counterparts based on planes I've personally flown or ones I know people have flown. They have drastically improved performance since launch. But that's it. You STILL can't set a starting point, altitude, heading, airspeed, etc. You know, basic flight simulator stuff. If you start in a jet, you're starting at 31,000'. Want to practice landings, and just want to set yourself on final south of the field. NO. In a program called FLIGHT SIMULATOR, you cannot do that. So you can spawn at 31,000'. OK sure, you can slew down. Well guess what happens then? Because of the magic of aerodynamics, suddenly you're overspeeding. And the moment you un slew the aircraft. BOOM. Overstressed. You die. If you want to fly over your house, sure, get it. Just keep in mind that your Steam return policy will burn up because this game downloads itself via its own installer, so unless you can download the 150 something odd GB in an hour, you'll never be able to actually see the game before you can't send it packing. I want to love this. Aviation IS MY LIFE. Video games are another part of my life. This thing sucks at fulfilling both. So take it or leave it, this is just my opinion.

First, there is the download of the content and then the updates.  If you have a 1 Gbps connection, it appears that you are throttled by the ""Xbox Networking"" (see the Xbox gaming settings in Windows 10 by searching for ""Xbox Networking) to an average speed of 6 Mbps to 30 Mbps.  It takes DAYS to download the game and its updates.  Thinking you are unique you search the web and find that at 6 Mbps to 30 Mbps you are getting far better download speeds than the other people who are complaining.  Meanwhile, Steam games download and update at speeds of up to 800 Mbps.  If Xbox networking is an example of Microsoft's cloud computing, then I want no part of it.  

Second, a lot of the old keyboard commands of previous versions of Microsoft Flight Simulator no longer work, as they want you to use your mouse to interact with the virtual cockpit, which means if you want ""free flight"" and to avoid using the autopilot and setting up a complete flight plan, forget it because you have to take your hand off of the joystick to use the mouse to control the cockpit settings.  No more controlling the joystick with your right hand (assuming you are right handed) and using your left hand to press keys on your keyboard.  

Third, you load in an aircraft and set the flaps, adjust the trim to ""in the green"" settings, set the radios, etc., and finally release the parking brake, and you get a verbal error that tells you that you cannot fly.  Does it give any reason why?  NO!  So you search online for a couple of hours and verify a bunch of settings and everything checks out okay and you still can't fly.  

Fourth, when you want to set your departure and arrival airports, you discover that the search is basically a joke.  It is apparently case sensitive, and expects you to know the call sign/identifier for the airport.  Want to find airports in Virginia?  Want to find airports in Utah?  Want to find airports in Washington state?  Sorry, there is no drop down for selecting the country, no drop down for selecting the city, etc. and then selecting the airport.  Say you want to find an airport on the island of Maui in Hawaii.  Good luck!  Your best bet is to call a pilot friend and ask them to use their resources to find some airports in Maui.  The departure/arrival airport selection process is a nightmare.  

The one positive thing is that if you eventually do manage to get an aircraft off the ground, the graphics are very good and nice and smooth.  I'm using an i7-12700 with 64 GB RAM, 2TB Samsung 990 Pro system drive and 2 TB Samsung 980 Pro game drive with an ASUS Z690-E motherboard and an ASUS ROG STRIX RTX 4080 OC 16 GB card at a display resolution of 3840 x 2160 and it is beautiful.  

Ultimately the problem is that Flight Simulator is such a pain in the rear to download, update, and then fly, and so expensive, that you wonder it you should have stayed with Flight Simulator X.  

It is getting late here and with the amount of frustration (which leads to a large amount of cursing) involved with trying to get this aircraft to actually start a takeoff roll, I'd better stop and call it a night before I wake up the neighbors.  

If the situation improves, I'll post an update.  If I don't post an update, it means I've given up, written this new version of Flight Simulator off as a lost cause and a waste of money, and returned to flying with Flight Simulator X.

Cons: 
The game is buggy as hell, and regularly corrupts itself to the point of reinstall. In fact, just reinstalling it through Steam isn't enough.  You have to follow a manual process to remove all traces of it, before reinstalling.  

VR mode is totally unplayable on reasonably strong hardware (12900K + 3080 + 32GB).  Amazingly this remains true even if you dial all the settings to their absolute minimum.

They look like old houses and shed type buildings from WW2, and they all look the same.

The Flightradar24 app on my phone has the most current maps and buildings I've seen online, and I wish I could get their maps on this sim, but even if those better maps were on here, the AI building models would ruin it...

The flying is good though, on some planes.

As far as I'm concerned, half the sim is flying the planes and the other half is the scenery, and the scenery part is kinda sad outa the box.

Hopefully I can create and change some of the scenery with Google Maps and Blender etc...
If I can find the time, otherwise the couple of hours I already spent in the sim is about all there really is to see unfortunately, over and over and over again...

For 2020, and what's available out there technology wise today, it's pretty sad that there isn't a simple way to update and or edit areas of the terrain to be more accurate and appealing without having to mess around with it in 3rd party apps and programs for days or weeks, learning a new trade or hobby just to see your house in a flight sim...

Overall the game is still great as the scenery and weather are beautiful. Don't expect it to accurately reflect the physics, but do expect a more arcade-like flying experience with great cockpit resolution and instrument functionality.

Don't bother now (summer 2023) New sim being released later this year or next with many of the features we have been waiting to have added during the 10 year development window. Basically you would be buying the beta unless they dont include the whole earth sandbox aspect of 2020. Somehow I dont see that happening.

UPDATED REVIEW AFTER 200+ HOURS IN GAME - 

Amazing. It just keeps getting better and better.  Every update brings new functionality, upgrades to scenery and texture maps, more detailed cities and landmarks.... and there are still years to go in the promised development cycle. Running a mix of ultra and high settings at 5120x1440 on dual monitors I average 70fps with an RX 5600XT and Ryzen 3900X. I am overclocked and custom water cooled so your results may vary but its not as demanding as you might think.  If you are on the fence jump off and get in here!

Original Review - 

Let me get this out of the way.... IT SAY'S ""SIMULATOR"" IN THE FREAKING TITLE!!!

Ok, now that any recently upgraded peasantry has been silenced lets get into the good stuff.

THIS is the one we have waited for.  Its a little rough with older flight sticks/controllers but there is enough adjustment in the sensitivity and deadzone settings to make even the jitteriest stick settle the F down.  Honestly I had to turn the settings to -100 on my Logitech Force 3D Pro just to keep from flipping the Cessna 172 in an impossible to recover from snap roll.   It's not a pop the cartridge in and go experience. You will need to learn and adjust as you go. I have things working  decently now and have started spreading my wings (see what I did there) and exploring places around the world I've never been as well as places I know very well.

That brings me to scenery. Outstanding work on all levels. Yes there are some glitches  in places , but its the whole damn planet. When you get too close to the ground you can get some weird looking trees/buildings but from 1000 feet most everything looks damn good. The development window is wide open now as this software just dropped. It's only getting better from here.

Ok, I will get into it one more time. It's not a game in the traditional sense. There is no enemy to defeat, no puzzles to solve, no competition to be bested unless you do some group flying with your buddies and try to see who can fly under things (not all bridges are clear underneath FYI). This is a simulation of multiple aircraft and multiple locations. There will be more content added and improved as time goes on so quit sandbagging and get in here!!",1598133246,1689560794,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Microsoft Flight Simulator is a masterpiece. It's like stepping into the booth with the best equipment - the details are on point, the graphics are crisp, and the world is yours to explore. It's a next-level experience.

This simulator isn't playing games - it's serious about delivering a real flight experience. You got a full range of aircraft, real-world weather conditions, and dynamic day-night cycles. It's like producing a mixtape, you've got control of all the elements, and you can make it your own.

But, let's bring it back down to earth for a second. We gotta address the learning curve. It's steep, just like climbing to the top. But remember, the journey to more success starts with a single step, or in this case, a single flight. Stick with it, learn the controls, master the techniques, and you'll be cruising through the skies in no time.

All in all, Microsoft Flight Simulator is like a DJ Khaled track. It's high-quality, it's immersive, and it's all about living your best life. It's about the thrill of the flight, the beauty of the world, and the joy of exploration.

Remember, ""We The Best!"" and Microsoft Flight Simulator is definitely one of the best in the flight sim game. Get in the cockpit, take to the skies, and keep reaching for new heights.

I purchased the Standard 40th anniversary edition, the joystick now works.
At the moment I am working through the game settings to see what will run on my PC.
I like the new user interface & all of the new additional items.
No explanation as to why this edition is running at a much higher FPS, PC is the same.

If I succeed in fully getting the settings OK, with the level of details available, I will probably uninstall FSX Steam to free up Disc space.


ORIGINAL BAD REVIEW
Download & installation went OK even if a tad slow. From what I could see looks great but could not fly with it.
Joy stick would not function, although identified in options menu. Once a flight was chosen could only achieve 10FPS max even on settings recommended by the software.

However, the two big improvements needed are to be able to adjust the horizon looking out front of the cockpit so that you can see the ground, airport, runway.

I have no real world experience as a pilot but compared to other sims I have used the actual experience of piloting does seem to be as good if not better and is constantly improving.

I've only ever used high-end hardware with flight sims but with MSFS I can max out pretty much all the visual and world detail settings and still have smooth flight. This is something I couldn't say of earlier sims which always had some performance issues, even with the best hardware if you wanted everything to the max.

In the past 2 years I've toured a large part of the world which is something I never had the motivation to do before and which I think speaks for itself :-) There are a vast number of add-ons to choose from, both free and payware, many of which really enhance the sim and cover most of the world.

My only dislikes are the dependence on the on-line features (with very degraded local options) and the inability to control how and when the sim is updated. However, I recognise this is absolutely necessary to provide the full experience and problems are only occasional and usually soon fixed.

So I would definitely recommend MSFS but it does take a little commitment to get the best out of it.",1689358225,1689358225,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have spent 13h installing the software. The installation got stuck several times on different ""decompressing"" steps. The solution (or so I thought) was to pause the installation and remove the file it was trying to decompress, wait for it to re-download and try again. Sometimes it wasn't needed though. Just restarting the game fixed the issue a couple of times. This occurred about several times during the installation. 

After installation I boot up the latest and greatest Flight Simulator only to see that the plane in the hangar is missing textures, some menu items seem to have internal IDs showing and not the text intended for display. Also two of the three menu options at the top of the screen contain nothing.

Thought to myself ""Well, things happen... I'll just verify the game files through Steam. The installation was a bit bumpy after all"".

Since I still had the installation folder open on my second screen after manually removing undecompressable files, the horror was instant. 

!!!VERIFICATION OF GAME FILES REMOVES ALL DOWNLOADED CONTENT!!!

So at the moment at least I know for a fact what my issue is. The game is not downloaded anymore.

After 482 additional hours (because of downloading times) of additional play since my last review, I have around 12 hours flying time. That's about 470 hours of download time that Steam counts as gameplay. Stupid, right? This is another reason why you guys (ASOBO) deserve an updated review. Is this the best flight simulator for GA and commercial on the market? Debatable. Looks great, sure. Does it still present significant issues at all times when flying 2d or VR? Absolutely. Why is it that my trim wheel (Honeycomb Bravo) is still being recognized as a button and not an axis? Why do I have to download three third-party applications just to get it running properly? MSFS 2020 has been out for years and this is an issue? Why? I cannot stand that some of my peripherals are being rendered obsolete from one update to the next? I understand there will be issues with programming; Fix one  thing and another breaks. I get that. But dang, is it frustrating. All I want to do is plug and play with all of my thousands of dollars worth of equipment I bought for flying in VR. But daggum! These updates make me cross my fingers after each one and its a gamble as to how many hours I will have to spend looking up solutions for my no-longer-functional sim hardware. I wish Asobo prioritized making sure our hardware works before releasing updates. It's not like everyone in the team can't afford to test one piece of hardware each before releasing it to the public. I am tired of spending countless hours on forums and videos to try and find solutions to each issue after an update. Often times, I don't find a solution and just have to put the sim down. 

All of this being said: The team is doing a good job at making the game look great. Great job all. Now can we please make sure all major hardware names work with this sim before releasing updates? I want to give this a recommendation, but if anyone else shares my frustration and disappointment, let me know. If anyone reads this and knows a fix to ongoing issues, let me know. I'll fly as often as I can with what I've got to work with. Clear skies, everyone. 

Original Review: Have spent weeks playing when first released. However, I prefer flying in VR so have waited for it for months. Finally, VR is released and its time to redownload MSFS2020. WEEKS. I spent weeks downloading this sim again because the last update did something. I'm no tech guy, but I can't get past 4mb/s download speed. Have tried every recommended action from their site and forums to no avail. I just downloaded Elite Dangerous through steam at 20gb in less than half an hour, yet can't even install MSFS. Once it downloads up to around 70g, it loops and I have to restart after troubleshooting without a fix. I had preordered the premium package, so once the base game is installed, I still have to download over 60gb of extra data for my planes and purchases. Would love to see what this game offers in VR as much as I enjoyed it when it first released. However, Asobo has let me down with this download method. HOT GARBAGE, even on gig connections. Would love to see this fixed so I could actually fly after spending over $1k in new hardware to include the HP Reverb G2, Honeycomb Yoke, and 10000 series processor for the sole purpose of bush flying in a Savage Cub over the PNW. For the love of all things holy, fix this trash download system so that flight sim loyalists can enjoy this near masterpiece.

Whilst graphically the game is stunning but the overall flight physics are substandard, especially in the domain of the tail draggers; which ends up being the most arcade like take of a tail dragger I've ever experienced.
There are some factors that are modelled well such as the navigational systems (on select aircraft), visual effects, and weather effects.

Overall if you're just wanting a bit of eye candy, to understand the basics of aviation, or to maybe hash over a VFR route prior to flying the real thing it's okay.
But if you're wanting a more substantiated ""flight simulator"" in your home, best to stick with X-Plane for a more realistic experience.",1688772641,1688772641,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

After 42 HOURS of downloading I was at least able to start the so called game / simulation, I did not have time to test it out very much, it was now Monday, and I, as everyone else had to go to work. the game started out by telling me that my input devices was not recognized. well I am a stubborn person, I will keep you posted!!

It says I played 17 hours now, I have not yet seen the game for 1 minute! If there is a game? Is there anything valuable behind the endless ""updates""? I don't know. at a download rate from Microsoft on 1-3 Mb/s it takes time to get approx 200 GB data downloaded The problem is not at my end, I know I am cheap, having only a 50/50 Mbps connection, but that should still be ok.
Bought this very expensive piece of software to have some fun during the weekend, come Sunday and I haven't seen a plane yet. 
I may edit this review once I actually see the game, but for now this is just a topnotch download simulator.
And Microsoft... PLEASE stop the f****** download feel good music, It is driving me crazy after 17 hours.",1688270029,1688564345,False,1,0,0.507845938205718994,0,True,False,False

This game in VR is simply mind-blowing. It gave me so many emotions all together, which I never experienced in any other game. 

The Darkstar challenge left me speechless. I almost cried when I flew over my parent's house where I grew up. I was incredibly excited when I flew in the grand canyon and passed under the tower bridge in London. 

Overall, an incredible experience. Worth every single penny.
