Only 57 accounts on that are clearly exploited the exchange rate but they need 3 weeks of banning for investigation with the result that over 30% of the population are permanent ban. The point is they banned those accounts not by they exploited the exchange rate but because of ""violated the term of service"" reasons which arent showed by any evidence or any announcement before.
All of that led to the raging from whole community, as you can explain, 30% total accounts were banned even though they did nothing wrong will lead to another mass quitting for whole server.

Once you get used to controlling 3 characters, you feel like you're ready for four. 

I enjoy this game. Its like finding your favorite flavor of candy and forever returning to it from your childhood to when you get old and then you have arthritis.. Its great that Granado Espada found its way on Steam. I hoped for IMC to make a comeback like ""notice me senpai"" to the world and it did.

Anyway, you can already feel the tweaks and improvements made to balance and level the playing field for players making it quite refreshing. I love that the NPCs have voices now. The new soundtracks addicting and very memorable. The new environments are vast and beautiful. Also some interfaces streamlined making it easier to access things. One thing that is distracting and awkward in this release is that some storyline dialogue remain in raw english. Certain scenarios like Armonia (one of my favorites and have certainly grown to enjoy thanks to the characters there. Who doesn't like the Pope, crusaders and dark magic?) You can overlook the flaws of the dialogues just by guessing what they mean in their broken english, but maybe this is something I bet the developers are working on improving in the future. The variety of characters are by far the best thing, and new characters are exciting to look forward to. The graphics for them are nice as well.  IMC seem to know what is trending at the moment, like pop culture, designing with some hint of it, but maintaining the medieval look to it, which is unique. The characters get better and better and changes the way you approach the game. Choosing a lineup is definitely hard as tactics and strategy come into play, and the time spent maintaining and interchanging their gears will keep you busy but feeling satisfied and accomplished.

For me, IMC is doing well listening to the needs of its players, its a rather old game, but they're keeping things fresh with weekly updates, introducing a lineup of events with ample amount of time to spend doing them. Its great to see the community come around once more. Though I do hope the forum itself gets more noisier someday because its rather tame and dare I say, a few crybabies, but typical babies with WANTS like any other game.

Plus points:
1) Very unique MMO. Lots of characters to play, over 160. You will be spoil for choice.
2) Solid music lots of tracks
3) Great 1 month log in daily quests reward for starters.
4) Good community
5) Lots of things to explore from costume, weapons crafting stuffs.
6) Quests are alot and able to recruit some characters, not sure how good some of them are.
7) You can auto farm or afk playing while you work or out so long you camp at the right place and leave your pc on.  
8) Its free to play so you can quite anytime if you do not like it.



Minus points.
1) Graphic are decent.
2) Definitely like 1 of those pay to win games and also pay to get high end items etc.
3) PVP is terrible theres no control even when my friend who is like me enjoying the game content and focus on pve only taking the Special Buff. those PVP ranking cheaters will be stationing there and camp players coming during the 30mins buffs time. Very bad interface no control should restrict the area around the zone for friendly. Just turn off some pve players trying to enjoy the game.
4) 160 characters will mean you have to spend more and prepare more items for your characters instead of the normal 1 to 3. Be prepare to equip at least 6 to 12 or even more characters. Imagine that.!!
5) This is defintely a gambling game where you either have to find ways to camp and make alot of Vis, as in game currency or pay 3rd party gold farmers or buy icash to top up and draw chests and special events.  
6) Quests are sometimes quite confusing and not properly directed. Not very user friendly.
7) Enchancing weapons, armours and even more sockets will have a chance to lose yr item. 

Graphic: 7.5/10( If you have a high end graphics card its pretty decent not bad)
Gameplay: 8/10
Sound/Music: 8.5/10
Control: 7/10
Community: 7/10
PVE: 9/10
PVP:2.5/10

Overall: 7/10 , 75/100

Conclusion: This game is unique and worth playing it for fun. If you can afford spending some money is pretty ok if you like the game but be warned this is a extremely expensive game if you have no time to play as every thing advances pretty fast.  But if you can use your pc to afk most times then playing should be a problem. Good thing is that you can afk while working most times.",1513435497,1515599166,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
663090,35787632,76561198219579905,0,8,163979,0,9506,1705143146,"Great game, great soundtrack, great gameplay. Only things that can ruin this game in my opinion are crappy players (or botters) and crappy management but I have high hopes for IMC. 

The fact that you can control three characters in a team, can AFK to level up LEGITIMATELY (helps to take some of the sting out of the grindfest typical in Korean MMORPGs) and can ""recruit"" barracks of characters are big bonuses in my book. If you're a collector kind of gamer like me (sort-of), this game will be right up your alley. I had a blast collecting characters, costumes, pets and a whole bunch of crap that I have no idea why I'm hoarding up for. There are so many characters to recruit and team combinations you can play around with you'll hardly get bored, especially since there is no lack of cute guy RNPCs. Ho ho, here comes my harem of ikemen.  

Downside is high electricity bills from all the AFK-ing. This game is advertised as F2P and you can actually have a decent casual gaming experience without really burning a lot of cash since there are a variety of sidequests and raids to keep players of all levels entertained. But I think if you want to move further beyond (think higher-end raids with all the imbal drops, colony wars and stuff) you'll have to start thinking about ""investing"" in your family and gears in the game. You know, ka-ching ka-ching. This is because as you progress more into the game it will get insanely hard to clear quests which you will need imbal players, imbal faction, imbal gears and a lucky underwear to help you clear. But, they might probably ""dumb down"" the quests a couple years later if you can sit and twiddle your thumbs until then. 

I guess this game would be considered a little dated now since the first Korean release was a long time ago. Even though I've played other MMORPGs with better graphics since then, Granado Espada remains one of my most favorite MMORPGs. There's much to learn and play in this game, for both former and new players alike, but there's nothing to stop anyone from immersing in this beautiful world and play at your own pace.
