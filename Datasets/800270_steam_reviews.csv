Edit: I've now tried playing the solo mode and I was able to play that 7 times without crashing. These games are much faster too as you do not have to wait for an AI to take a turn. Obviously this has improved my experience tremendously but I'm still not sure about playing against the AI.

Lots of bugs make it impossible to finish multiplayer games in most cases, and from the design side I think there are two big issues: one is time management, the other is lack of undos. The time management is quite bad because there's an allotted amount of time for each player, which incredibly counts time wasted by the game itself (animations and lag). A game is pretty long and if you do nothing for 30 minutes you can block the game for everybody. On the opposite side, you can get a game loss (and karma penalty) even if you're rushing to complete the game simply because the game is lagging. I think the proper solution would be to assign a given amount of time to each generation, and make you auto-pass (or substitute you with AI) if you finish time for that generation.

The lack of undos is quite annoying because in this game you can take several actions that give you no additional information and allowing you to get undos would not spoil the game in any way.

Playing tabletop on our laptop has given boardgaming back to my wife and I after having little kids too young to play but very interested in what we're doing. TM has some recent bad reviews because the second expansion was poorly designed and that is true. The ""V-cards and Floaters"" of Venus Next add an asymmetry to the number of actions each player takes and that's no fun. We still play it sometimes, but you might find yourself passed out, just watching the other player take turn after turn of actions on Venus. Can't recommend VN, but the core game and Prelude expansion are a DIAMOND(er, two diamonds?). And the steam version speeds the decision making up so beautifully by graying-out and removing options that aren't currently available to you, and also by calculating and collecting all your rewards BTW, we play hotseat local, usually.  11/10 recommend! 

Couple minor notes for the developers. You should be able to turn off the opponent actions summary when playing hotseat. We take our turns and then both watch the turn again. At least you can speed that up. Also, you'll sometimes play a card and forget what it was, or what you're placing, and you can't go back to look at it. Applies to stuff like Mangrove, where you might go ""wait, why is it directing me to ocean tiles?""  And lastly, sometimes you'll play a resource-remover card and have to target yourself. There's no way to go back. Examples is that I play predators and have to eat one of my own pets.

I have been playing the Board game for 5 years, and I really like this game.  Competitive strategy, multiple paths to Victory, and planning opportunities for compounding effect.  

When I looked into the computer version, other reviews were negative, apparently because of a few ""glitches"" which seemed to affect ""group"" play.  I spent the $20 to check it out myself, because I really, really like the board game, and I was hoping I would be able to get a similar experience on the computer (instead of taking over the entire dining room table for several days to play the board game solo; or playing as several players instead of the solo version).

I LOVE IT !!! The game doesn't take as long, because the computer does all the work (scoring and etc.)  And I have NOT experienced any of the glitches others complained about.  

MAKE SURE YOU ADD IN PRELUDE -- It's fabulous.  I'm going to pick up the Venus Next and H & E extensions today.

When you break working code that prevent the game getting started or being able to play through, all the other bug fixes are entirely irrevelatn. 

Considering this has happened from the first release and through every subsequent release, there MUST be an underlying bad software architecture because when you constantly break something when you try to fix something else, it is usually architecture that is broken.  

I appreciate that the original developers are gone and the newest devs have inherited something inherently problematic. I have well over 100 games on steam and I play boardgames on boardgamearena.com of all sorts. The Steam implementation of Terraforming Mars is the WORST for poor testing and release management. Nothing as broken as most of the releases have shown should be let into production. There is a management failure and a testing failure and likely a bad inherited architecture such that fixing one thing breaks another almost every time.

I would not buy this product due to its instability and it has been that way fairly regularly since the start. I love it when it works, but when they wreck my ability to start or complete a game without me buying any more DLCs, then I have a massive problem with that. 

It's sad: The game itself (boardgame) is awesome. This implementation, when it has been worked enough to be well functional is also great. But the fact they blow up major parts of the function (and the latest is the worst yet) is inscrutable; If you bork major features like 'start a game', you ought to revert and roll-back the upgrade until you have a lot more testing. 

If you gave me the 2022 middle of year release and never did another thing, it'd be a working, decent game with a few bits of wonky behaviour that you could try to avoid. But with updates that wipe out my ability to play again makes me really cheesed off. That's just plain hard to fathom - are they trying to have me and everyone I've introduced to the game to never want to buy anything from their company? 

Do better. Or do nothing. Don't break the game for everyone. That should be the first question from the release manager to the devs: Will your new patch totally break the game if I engage any of the other DLC content? It will?

It seems to me at least one achievment is bugged.
I unlocked:

But it is obvious that the devs do not test their product updates before publishing here on Steam, or they would have caught game breaking bugs in the regression tests before publishing. As a software tester, I know what I talk about. For a long time there was a bug that prevented the counting victory point at the end of the game. Basically the game got stuck and all you could do was force-quit. At least you could play the game, you just didn't know who won. Then there was a bug that made the game unplayable due to UI elements not getting removed after opening and closing the history of played cards view. But there were ways around that problem (just don't click that button). These bugs were fixed after a few months(!). But the latest bug trumps them all. The game will not even start beyond picking a corporation and prelude cards. Come guys, did you even do a single play test before releasing this update? The answer is clearly ""no"".

Devs, I assume you use a Scrum/agile methodology. Fix your defintion-of-done. It is clearly missing ""testing"", ""regression testing"" and ""test automation"". And Product Owner, as value maximer, your product is losing a lot of value due to the large sways in non-functional quality of your product increments. The amount of game breaking bugs introduced in 2023 alone and the time it took to fix them is unacceptable. Figure out in what phase bugs are found (during development, during regression test, during beta test, after published on steam, etc), turn this into a KPI and invest (heavily) in improving this KPI, so that bugs are found much earlier (not by your end customers).

[h3]FINAL UPDATE 12-20-23: (Now With 100% More Buyer's Remorse!)[/h3]

I legitimately contemplated whether to update this review, but not because my ""thumbs down"" opinion has changed - it emphatically has NOT changed. Not even in the slightest. In fact, as predicted by precisely everyone [u]except[/u] that one random-ass guy in the discussions a few months back who [i]insisted[/i] there's never been a single issue with this game ([i]you know who you are[/i]), it's all gotten [b]WAY worse[/b] with recent patches. I uninstalled months ago (shortly after my last update to this review mid September) and the most positive thing I can possibly say about the whole thing is that I managed to use the freed up storage space for something ever so slightly less pointless (I can neither confirm nor deny the staggering amount of memes I have saved on my computer right now).

No, I contemplated whether to update this review because I wasn't sure if it was even worth my time and effort to do so. I literally don't want to have this game anymore. I'm actually going to remove it from my steam library, that's how little I trust the devs to even so much as make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. They'll forget the jelly and god HELP me if I ask them to try and cut it in half.

This will NEVER be salvaged from the current dev team. That they are complete and total suck is entirely impossible to overstate, and I'm done caring about it. I've moved on. I'm accepting the L, and cutting ties with the ""sunk cost"" fallacy.

Either buy it or don't, as you choose. It's your foule Duessa and I'm not the boss of you in any case. Would that you'd learn from my mistakes, though. Caveat. [b]Emptor.[/b]

--------------------
[h3]UPDATE 9-14-23:[/h3]

I Played about 7 minutes of the new patch, and managed to repro the softlock surrounding opening the ""cards played"" screen that's been plaguing this game for well over a year. So while I didn't technically check and see if the bug I originally complained about was fixed, my overall opinion remains unchanged at this time. Original review below:
---------------

I haven't played this game even once in a multiplayer capacity. I've explicitly played it in ""local"" mode against AI's. I have the expansions and use them regularly. But even in the base game, against only the AI's or even the tutorials, I encounter bugs. One that I get EVERY SINGLE GAME, is when an AI will gain a card just before passing the turn to me, and when that happens, my card count in the lower-center of the screen disappears. I cannot click on it. I cannot see how many cards I have. I cannot play my cards as a consequence. If you're unfamiliar with this game, be assured that playing cards is an integral part of the process.

The workaround is to click on any other opponent, and then click back to my screen. This shows my card count as normal. As such, it's a minor bug for me, personally, because I'm playing against AI so I can take all the time in the world to clickity click and engage the workarounds. But it's the principle, not the severity of my particular context, that is important.

The game's bugged. VERY, VERY bugged. And apparently has been since it came out.

I cannot in good conscience recommend this particular purchase even though it's usually playable in my particular use case. It's a fantastic board game -- I enjoy it only slightly less than Gaia Project (which also has a Steam version and is ACTUALLY very well put together and ACTUALLY almost always bug free). And the graphics are pretty and the music/SFX are decent and the gameplay -- when it actually is allowed to execute without bugs -- is largely true to the board game.

But good [i]glorious[/i] gravy, the BUGS.

Only reason I'm still playing on occasion is because I already went well past my refund window, and because technically, I can usually finish my games against the AI's. If my RL bud who owns this tabletop actually lived within ""pop-in"" distance I'd forget this online travesty ever existed. And I would suggest any prospective buyer here, do the same unless and until the developers actually develop.

2023.02.24
Multiplayer is unplayable right now with game-breaking bugs. I've rolled back to 1.4 and don't plan on playing again until at least 2.1. 

Old review: 
I really like this game. My physical copy doesn't see much action because of the time commitment and goals of my average game nights. However, with this version I can play with remote friends or strangers, and the solo experience is much better than physical.
This digital version has more than its fair share of bugs yesterday I had to quit a game on generation 6 because A menu didn't pop up for me. I still really enjoy the experience and hope the devs get the bugs sorted out fast.",1636783162,1702775994,False,0,0,0.494785934686660767,0,True,False,False

Disregard the first edit. Since the Venus Expansion, everything is buggy again. It's actually at it's worst point, currently.

EDIT August 2023:
I now can recommend the game! The last patch has gotten rid of most of the bugs! Timer bug, card bug, chat bug, draft bug! I love you guys at Twins Sails, finally fixing the broken mess you've inherited!

PRE-EDIT REVIEW (most of the design problem still persist, most bugs are gone however!)
[b]I was sorely disappointed by this port[/b]. It has a few bugs and small problems that I'm completely fine with in a fresh release. They will hopefully be patched and everything will be ok.
EDIT 2023: 4 years later. Still an absolute mess. Minor improvements but the timer-bug make 50% of game unplayabale.

The main problem of this port, however, lies in in the two things that matter for userfriendliness:

[h1]1. UI - Design:[/h1]
[b]A) Speed:[/b] The whole UI is extremely clunky. Everything is hidden in some sub-menu. 
EDIT 2023: Animations can be turned off. The time still passes, though.

[b]B) Overview:[/b] Hiding everything in menus doesn't just slow down the game, it also turns the game into a spreadsheet game where you have no idea of the state of the game. EVERY LAST THING IN A MENU COULD BE ON THE MAIN SCREEN! There is a lot of unused space. e.g. There is a huge ""Standard Projects"" bar at the top, to open up a menu to click on standard project. There is no reason for this. It could all be moved to the left side (like in the boardgame) on the main screen. 
Other things hidden in a menu: 

[b]C) Shortcuts:[/b] They don't exist. Most common shortcuts you can find in every programm aren't there. No tab, backspace, etc. It's like this was never meant to be used on a computer. 
EDIT 2023: Tab opens the Menu. Are you kidding me? It should obviously swtich between players...


[h1]2. Graphic Design:[/h1]
Terraforming Mars (the boardgame) has one of the best graphic designs & iconography I have ever seen. This port has one of the worst. The tags are really difficult to see. The segments/lines, font size, color choice, mix of planet art and player color line on the map are seem to be an amateurish mishmash of different designs and bad proportions. e.g. It is not clear, hot many oceans are where, as they follow a completely different style from other tiles. The numbers of income and avaiable ressources could also be easier to distinguish.


All in all, this port feels like it was designed by people who haven't played the game more than 2-3 times. It is so unintuitive and clunky, that it barely saves time. It could have used the superb design of the original but went with some amateurish alternative instead. (man, I feel rather mean typing this...)

[b]I really hope these things are addressed soon.[/b] It's such a waste to see such a great game with such a badly designed port and I'm afraid that the UI will stay more of less the way it is, despite needing a complete overhaul. (I read that betatester feedback was ignored and not implemented for release.)

EDIT February 2023: Some problems habe been adressed (animations, expansions). The timer... Your timer starts going down when the animations of the previous player's actions are runing. yes, it's dumb. There should be any transitions between players. Also, when a player's time drops to 0, he gets kicked form the game and an AI replaces him, instead of just giving him 10sec per turn for the rest of the game.  The AI then often loops and takes 5-10 minute per TURN, sometimes everything gets locked up and your own countdown goas down without you being able to to anything.

EDIT May 2023: I've had several games where rejoining is impossible. Since you have to restart the game a lot to get around bugs, this is infuriating.",1539965833,1702412484,False,0,0,0.500273048877716064,0,True,False,False

The implementation of the original board game is done perfectly in my opinion, everything feels like it would be on a real board. The interfaces, menus and buttons are done okay'ish and playing the game online is also fun, in case it doesn't get unexpectedly interrupted by a network issue, a bug, disconnecting players, or a crash. So let's talk about those.

I have played this game for 15 hours now and I tried playing 6 rounds from beginning to end:
- In 2 games, the timer bugged out, so the game was frozen and softlocked. 
- In 1 game, the servers just shut down and I got booted out of the game, without the possibility of resuming the game. 
- In 1 game, both of my opponents left and I had to play the game to the end against dumb AI opponents. 
- In 2 games it happened to be that I was able to finish the game with at least 1 other human opponent sitting at the board.

You see the pattern - The game is plagued by bugs which are caused by poor game development and bad network maintenance. Also, the online community is in a bad shape, so that quitting games is practiced regularly.

I do not recommend playing this game, it is in 60%+ of the online games just a disappointment or a waste of time.",1701251247,1701251295,False,4,0,0.529738366603851318,0,True,False,False

no map customisation a dlc for map is just bad design 
no game duration option
Got to reload the game at less once every game because of bug ( the game want you to do 1 specific action but is doesn't tell you what)
solo game mode is almost impossible ask you to win the game in 14 turn when everything is random while it take around 15 turn ending a game with 1 AI ( the more player the faster the game) with 4 AI it around 9 turn. Edit: with Venus DLC solar mode it become so much easier it almost not about stategy.

I wish we could Change the Terraforming score when initiating a game to not always start at 20 or have a real 3 choice of starting coorporation like in the board game where you are not given a beginner coorporation has a choice unless you don't play with coorporation.

I would love if we had a button to redraw your card at the beginning of your turn in case nothing is even remotely usable.  I once drew 4 card where none could be played because they needed less oxygen ocean and heat already in play. It already a tough game but when you got no card in hand it even worst.

The worst with the PC game is That it the board game no innovation no change when you got no limitation like needing a hard cardboard board game that can't change.
Map randomisation should have been easy. 
Terraforming index( heat oxygen ocean) minimum should be changeable at the start of the game to create custom game.

They should add atmospherics pressure not an other planet like Venus not that Venus is a bad idea but for it to have only 1 Terraforming index is sad.

You can compete against AI (or players) to gain the most points in terraforming mars. It looks very well thought out and I had to play a few matches to get the hang of it.

Do a simple google search for timers and you will see devs have not fixed the game even though they have had this feedback for years its a very common issue. its a very simple game and they charge a lot for it, so to not pay for fixes is bad karma from them. also eveything you look at or read resets as soon as the player on their active turn does anything so u have to keep clicking back into anything your looking at, like a played opponents card and this is not easy as they themselves are chasing the clock, so they spam click things then pass their go so again u have to read in your turn. some people are adpet at using the timer so reduce games to 30 min timer so they win more and go higher on leader board, hard to enjoy the game when u have to fully speed run it all the time. many people who dont have a good opening hand or who get annoyed if you get a combo to work run the timer out, as in go afk for their full timer around 45mins to an hour, so u have to do something else with the game running for an hour till it goes to ai then u have to play AI, if you decide to quit instead, then you guessed it -5 Karma on your Karma rating. some people choose the setting to remove ai substitute so ur just stuck there, ie they set up a game and fully troll you if they are not happy and go afk. 100% feels like a speed game so reduces alot of what i enjoy about the game. ie you have to switch animations off as this takes 4 seconds per card played and this will add to YOUR clock with opponent played cards, 160 cards in deck, on average 45 cards played per player, 3 player game is about 9 mins off your timer or not see any animations and ur basically playing a fast moving spreadsheet. so the aesthetics are shot out.",1700657363,1700823170,False,8,0,0.570165276527404785,0,True,False,False

I really enjoy Terraforming Mars (the boardgame) and I'd love to reccommend this online version of it... but unfortunately I find myself unable to do so (at least until the Dev team gets their stuff together).  

While the transition from table-top to electronic game was done quite faithfully (and - as I said - I do enjoy the boardgame) the implemention was - and is - constantly plagued by missing quality-of-life features (like a solid ""undo"" button in case of misclicks) and - especially - bugs, some of them mere annoyances, some of them gamebreaking. And the bugs - especially in the lack of fixing of them - are rather the dealbreaker for me. Some of them are mere ""annoyances"", like the one where you suddendly find your cards disappearing. With luck you may be able to restore them by switching to ""played cards"" and  back several times - but in the meantime you will be unable to plan your next move (unless you have memorized all of them). More severely sometimes the ""end turn"" simply becomes stuck for one player, causing the entire game to be lost. Both of them went unpatched for HALF A YEAR or longer - and in honesty, this is the level of quality control I'd expect from a fangame project, not for a game I've paid 20+€ for (plus expansions)",1699203578,1699203601,False,10,0,0.617177963256835938,0,True,False,False

Here now my honest review after over 120 hours played.

First things first. I love Terraforming Mars. I played the board game anc various expansion for several years know, and I believe TM is among one of the best boardgames out there.

That said, the PC adaptation is well done with respect to the game's mechanics, the interface is mostly fine and the artwork and music is decent. The PC version captures the boardgame feeling in almost all aspects... except for the MOST important one: playing with other human players!

The multiplayer solution in this game is just a bad joke!!

Lobby and ingame-chat are way to cumbersome to use (so that most players don't even bother sending a ""gg"") and the connection issues in MP are just horrendous. I lost connection in MP session so often, I cannot even count. And this both with friends in the same networt and with random human players on the internet. The reconnection often does not work and even if it does, your round timer keeps ticking, meaning sometimes you loose, because you just run out of time die to slow or lost connections. Sorry, this is just a deal breaker for me.
If you just wanna play solo or against the AI, you might find this game just fine. If you are looking to play it with your friends or just online... don't. Save yourself some trouble and just put the original boardgame on the table.

Updated review (from November 2023):
This is a digital adaptation of a hilariously complex, yet fast-paced, board game. The physical board game was made by a science teacher and his brothers and it shows. Everything oozes realistic science themes and suggests how mankind might one day make the red planet a second home for our species. 

The digital version is very true to the original and they complement each other well. Without having played the original, I feel the digital version would be hard to understand and the digital version lets me practice playing the original.

The game used to be very buggy, but the devs seem to have fixed pretty much everything and it is now very solid which it why I've changed my rating from negative to positive.


Pre-bug-fixing review (from July 2023):
Fantastic board game and this digital version has potential to be fantastic too. Sadly though, the game has been a buggy mess for a few months now with little to no info from the devs. It is almost unplayable at the time of writing this. Do NOT buy this!

Then there are a lot of non-game-breaking bugs that still haven't gotten addressed since release either. If possible, avoid the game. However, if you like the board game, there are very few alternatives.",1671739681,1698953228,True,0,0,0.508196711540222168,0,True,False,False

But the digital implementation has, for years, been flopping around, face-down in the red Martian soil.  Humanity will probably terraform Mars in real life before Twin Sails/LuckyHammers fixes the game that depicts it.

[h1]Oh My, The Bugs[/h1]

Normally, I won't downvote a game due to bugs, because I think as long as the developers are active, bugs will eventually get fixed.  However, Terraforming Mars is the rare exception.  It has been out since 2018, and each release is a mixed bag of fixing bugs for some players, and introducing new bugs to other players, ad infinitum.  Over time it has been a slow downward spiral.  It has gotten so bad that my friends and I have stopped playing.  Take a look at the comments on every developer update this year.  It's filled with people lamenting the game-breaking bugs. I honestly wish the devs would just throw in the towel and put this title on Board Game Arena.  You may think that's unlikely, but it has been done before (see [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/108210/discussions/0/3593338530523921178/]Memoir 44[/url]).  I've been burned by Terraforming Mars on so many updates that I have given up the hope that it will ever be in working order.

How bad are the bugs?  Well, let's start with the worst.  The game regularly hardlocks AT THE END of a two-hour match, when we are in our final turns, before we can see the end score.  There's no way to get around it, no way to skip to the end, you're just done; hours wasted.  Besides the dreaded end-game hardlocks, every match is usually plagued by softlocks. The affected players have to exit and reload the match to clear them. Sometimes doing it a few times in a row is necessary.

I've encountered numerous other bugs, but I'll leave it at that.

[h1]Besides the Bugs, A Few Good Things[/h1]

If it weren't for the bugs, this would have been a pretty good digital port for a board game.  When it worked, it was a great experience and would have earned a positive review.  The sounds and music all set the right ambiance.  The interface was intuitive, and you could easily access most of what you wanted to see with little clicking.  Despite being a terrible implementation, it's a good design (at least aesthetically).  A few other details could have been added, such as counts for tile types played (cities, greenery, etc), but those are minor.

[h1]No Undo Button[/h1]

There is no undo button.  Instead, the game asks you ""Are you sure?"" after every choice you make.  While it's better than nothing, it's a much more annoying alternative than simply having an undo button.  There are times that asking ""Are you sure?"" incessantly isn't enough.  I still get trapped into some things that should have no consequence for backing out.  For example, when choosing an action that consumes microbes, I'll change my mind after selecting the action, but before using the microbes.  I should be able to back out since I haven't consumed anything yet.  Well, you can't.

[h1]Solo Play[/h1]

I haven't had any issues with solo play.  If playing against AI is all you care about, then by all means, it's probably worth purchasing.  But what good is a board game, that's entirely intended to be multiplayer, that you can't play with other people?  I would downvote [i]any[/i] board game that fails this test (the only exception being board games designed to be solo play). 

[h1]The Board Game[/h1]

Aside from the buggy digital implementation on Steam, the tabletop board game is amazing.  It's currently sitting in the top ten board games of all time on Board Game Geek and it definitely deserves it.

It checks off nearly all of the features I think a good board game should possess:
[list]
[*][b]✔️Balances pure randomness and complete control/predictability[/b] - Card draw in a deck of cards will always be a random element in any game, but the fun is still in figuring out the best way to maximize what you've been given.
[*][b]✔️No ""one right move"" [/b] - You'll want to do everything, but you simply can't.  Every turn you need to make the tough decision of which strategies you will pursue, and which you will sacrifice.
[*][b]✔️Balance of rules (not too easy and not overcomplicated)[/b] - It's a heavier game, sure.  But none of the rules feel excessive or unnecessary.
[*][b]✔️Defined game length[/b] - Technically there is not a set number of turns, but a match snowballs the further you get into it, making it harder and harder to [i]not[/i] end it.
[*][b]✔️Replay Value (i.e. feels like a different game every time)[/b] - While the board layout is the same every time, you'll never get the same hand twice.
[*][b]✔️All players in it until the end[/b] - Players don't get eliminated, and I've had a few surprise leader changes at the end.
[*][b]✔️Decisions affect other players (Not separate games of solitaire)[/b] - Not every turn affects the other player, but you're still all competing to place tiles on the same planet, and there are some attack cards that affect other players.
[*][b]❌Total knowledge at game start (All possibilities on the table, not hidden in a deck of cards that only experienced players know about)  [/b] - I have to fail TM here on a technicality, but I still think it's a great game.  Just be aware that experienced players who know what kind of cards are in the deck will have an edge over newer players.
[/list]

I'm keeping my fingers crossed that they abandon this Steam port, and implement Terraforming Mars on Board Game Arena.

The automation of things like scoring and placement selection makes for a quicker play time than on the table top, and the visuals are solid. The audio needs better balancing, and honestly just turning off music has been the go to option for myself and the folks I play with.

It's also good to see that we still have active support on ongoing development. Terraforming Mars as a tabletop game is in my top ten without a doubt, and has a huge amount of content that I hope to see make it's way into the Steam version, not least the significant number of promo cards from the various kickstarters and seasonal promotions.
With their latest kickstarter just finished (Prelude 2, amongst other excellent additions) I expect we can look forward to the rest of the various expansions arriving in the future to Steam, and hopefully a 'Promos' DLC to add in, ideally, the full catalogue of promos for optional use.

It doesn't seem to be completely locking stuff out but now it is just overlaying random game screens on top of the game (this won't allow me to attach a picture or I would show a screen capture). Even exiting and reentering the game didn't correct the issue -- just changed what was visible and what wasn't.  Game is somewhat playable at least until I want to try and place something on the map (as that part is only partially visible).   EDIT (7/20/23) -- the app still hangs and forces me to quit and get back in (when it lets me back in).  I am not sure why they cannot seem to fix basic functionality of the game.  It is still hanging up in the draft phase of the game.  After I ""keep"" a card it goes back to the main game screen and nothing happens except my timer KEEPS COUNTING DOWN.  I don't get to take a turn, pick another card or anything else.  Sometimes exiting and getting back in fixes this (when it will let me back in).  Pretty sure that it isn't just me it is doing it to either.  Pretty sure it is doing it to my opponents as well.  I won't be playing again until there is another MAJOR update (and only then to see if it is fixed).  I was hoping that with a NEW VERSION (i.e. 2.0) that it would have fixed this basic yet major problem but alas it has not.


EDIT (4/22/2022) -- this app is really pissing me off.  The last couple games I have played I have had to exit and renter the game several times because the interface is locked up (although my timer keeps counting down) and I can't DO anything.  In my current game it is locked in the draft screen (after drafting the cards of which I only got to actually choose one) but won't actually let me click on the cards to ""keep"" them -- they are all greyed out -- but my timer is STILL COUNTING DOWN.  I have exited the application (to my desktop) and reentered twice and it is still stuck in the same place.  I am not gaining any karma points for these games (and may even be losing them) because it winds up timing out.  Because I can't earn karma there are a bunch of games I can't join due to karma restrictions.  YOU PEOPLE NEED TO FIGURE THIS OUT AND FIX IT!!!!!!!!!!!

I LOVE the game and while for the most part I like the app there is one issue that is consistent and doesn't seem to be being addressed by anyone -- I am constantly losing time on my turn even when I can't DO ANYTHING because the animation (which I have turned off as much of as I can) is still going through the previous players stuff.  This causes me to time out of almost every game less than 1hr per player.   It is 
exceptionally annoying because it also causes me to not be able to join some games because my player karma (or whatever this app calls it) isn't high enough.

You have to establish your own strengths and try to maximise them to win the game.   It's challenging to gauge how your opponents are doing in terms of victory points which makes it really interesting when you hit the score screen at the end and some opponents who you thought you left in your dust suddenly creep up on you. 

First game I focused on money production which kinda worked but by the end I was sitting on more money than I could spend. 

Second game I went for plants/greenery and did really well.

Third game I just played a game against 4 Hard opponents and I was pretty sure on the final turn I was in 1st or 2nd place - turns out I was in 4th lol.

My only criticism is I know it's based on the board game, but I would love it if there was a way to randomize the map tiles each time you play instead of having static resource locations. It would really open up the game to alot more options.

I am going to start nicely with this game is one of my favorite board games, that is why I ignored all the negative reviews.  
I am also going to state I almost never write negative reviews, as I run a business and hate them myself.  But when they are blatant and beyond well deserved, I feel it is a duty to warn other players and not waste the time (more than money) on this game in it's current state with this current dev team.

The status of this game currently and the dev team behind it is sadly atrocious.  THIS CAN BE FIXED, so I hope someone reads this an adjusts their dev team's priorities...

Major Problems:
Multiplayer is BEYOND broken atm, and the newest patch that was supposed to fix it made it far worse.
- Launching a massively bugged patch without beta test (if it was tested, man did that test fail miserably)
- Not IMMEDIATELY noticing the problem and rolling back the patch to fix it  (not keeping pre-patch instances would make it even worse of a dev team problem)
- Letting this go on for a week without a hot fix (dev team asleep??)
- And WORST of all, NOT COMMUNICATING with the user base.  It is completely understandable to say ""we screwed up, bare with us, here is a hopeful timeline).  Instead, silence...

Minor Problems:
Karma system.  The system incentivizes people to go afk instead of just forfeiting, which basically just ends the game for everyone instead of just the one person. 

Would be nice to play single player only, but the AI can go through the motions, but pretty much cannot win if you even halfway understand the game.  
So currently this game is meh in single player, and an absolute broken mess in multiplayer.

I HOPE to be able to check this review later (because they fixed their mistakes).  But for the current dev team issues listed above those hopes are fairly low.  Even though the solutions should be fairly easy to fix (I was a programmer for a time)

UPDATE: Well, at least the massive game breaking bugs were ""mostly"" fixed.  Still too many issues though to pay full price for this game.  AI is still garbage (like building a commercial district not touching any city), and online play if the AI has to take over, often it will bug out the game.

And now for an extra hot take, because the previous feedback just keeps getting ignored anyway.
It's not often that devs introduce new game breaking bugs 5 years after a release. But have no fear, Asmodee is here to cover you : my latest game just threw us a NEW deal-breaking bug that hangs the game (even on resume) and prevented us from even playing further. We had to force shutdown the app from task manager. *shakes head* ... Guys, a friendly (sarcastic) tip from your remaining (but fast dwindling fans): I think the aim is to _reduce_ bugs, not INCREASE them.

UPDATE : 30 Sept 2022
Online server connectivity is disastrous. Despite ensuring perfect online latency, the past several online games have had dozens of connection and delay issues.

UPDATE : 29 Sept 2022
Just lost another online save game. It's gone. -_-
The UI is finally been sorted out though: stable enough not to block/hang the game, and appropriate speed options have finally been added to streamline the game to an acceptable level

UPDATE : 29 May 2022
It's 4 years later. 4 years of time to fix bugs.

---------------

I do love this board game. Very much. But I want to let others know of its ""characteristics"" before purchasing it here, especially if they consider it and its DLCs at full price.

[b] SHORT VERSION: Recommended with caution [/b]

[u] PROS: [/u]
- faster game speed and general flow compared to IRL
- good looking UI
- costs and benefits of actions are done automatically (hence digital edition, duh)
- 200+ players online, community is nice
- expansions are being developed and added to the game as DLCs with Preludes and Elysium+Hellas boards already available, Venus Next almost finished

[u] CONS: [/u]
- extreme likelihood of bugs after each and every update, some of which are game breaking (see state of the game at the end of July 2023 which was horrendous)
- some bugs are still present since day 1 despite being reported numerous times
- no ""undo"" option even just for most recent single action - beware if you misclick of miscalculate often
- scores are not visible during the game and thus have to be calculated manually or require modding
- matching players with similar ranking (ELO) is nonexistent, any opponent can join if their karma is sufficient
- AI's laughable skill level

---------------

[b] LONG VERSION [/b]

[u] UPSIDES: [/u]

Overall the Steam version is enjoyable and since the most recent early August 2023 update it seems stable enough. The UI and general feel of the game are solid, it's nice to look at, and the flow and speed of the game are smoother and much faster than in person, and without errors due to the game calculating everything for the players and doing the necessary steps after each action (if no bugs intervene). So resources, production, points, placement bonuses, discounts, rebates etc. are calculated and given automatically, card tags and number of cards are visible and so on, all of which are very convenient. In my opinion this is the main advantage of the digital edition along with the constant availability of 200-300 players in online multiplayer. The community in general is nice (although rage quits do occur). The board game's expansions are being developed and added as DLCs, with Preludes and Elysium+Hellas boards already available, Venus Next is almost finished (time of release not known at the time of this review).

[u] DOWNSIDES: [/u]

The game always has been buggy, but the community who loves playing it learned to live with them. Some bugs have been around since day 1 (Arctic Algae's interaction with plant destroying ocean asteroids like Comet or Giant Ice Asteroid). With every update or patch there has been an enormous risk the game will provide a terrible experience for a time due to numerous new bugs being introduced. Here's a (probably incomplete) list of issues that have/had been plaguing this game in the past years:
- connection/network (having to rejoin the game numerous times, predominantly during the draft phase) - seems to be working okay now, was remarkably common (10+ occurrances in a single game) before the most recent early August 2023 update
- corporate and card effects not working properly (Helion's payment with heat, Olympus Conference's resource management, Aquifer Pumping's and Water Import from Europa's action, various payments with minerals just to name a few) - most of these work as intended now, some just got ironed out recently, unnecessary overpayment with minerals is possible though (pay 3+ steel for a 4 cost building tag for example), Arctic Algae's issue is still present
- certain cards breaking the game completely (interaction between Research and Mars University) - OK now
- card details disappearing (only cost and image is left) - still present, but less common
- chat ceasing to function - still present
- AI breaking the game that takes over players who forfeit - introduced with July 2023 update, couldn't test yet due to no one forfeiting but reportedly is no longer an issue (fingers crossed)

Not all times were equally bad, some were enjoyable but during some periods the game was practically unplayable in online multiplayer.

Another aspect that may concern players who wish to be matched with others of similar skill is that the online multiplayer only provides open or private hosting, meaning any player can join any open hosted table if their karma is high enough, there is no ""ladder"" or any sort of skill dependant match-making. The ELO and karma system are in a very rudimentary state, so players who wish to play competitively at a high level should be cautious.

Additional info for players who care about solo play against AI opponents, the AI's skill level is very low, to the point that I suspect playing random cards can be enough to beat it. For this reason, online tables are commonly made without AI subs, to prevent the AI messing up a player's plan due to a random disconnection, where the AI would step in until the player returns. But in turn this allows toxic players to ""rage quit"" by exiting the game and others need to wait for quitter's timer to go down to continue, which can take 30+ minutes depending on table settings. Be warned.

---------------

All in all if you love this game at least half as I do, and especially if you have friends with whom you'd play here regularly, it is worth it, preferably at a discount. But if you easily get frustrated due to bugs, or you don't want to risk 90+ mins of playtime going down the drain due to some error or mishap, sticking to playing the game elsewhere might be a better idea.

It's a solid digital re-creation, albeit with some limitations in the UI. Specifically, there's a lot of information that isn't readily available at a glance, such as what cards you've played or what card you're playing when it shifts to ""place a tile"" mode.

To my mind, it would have been a lot better to sort of split the game screen between the board and your played cards, maybe with the ability to hover over a card to expand it. It would also be nice to have some way to quickly look at the other players' cards - maybe again with some expanding mechanics.

It also doesn't show a full breakdown of your points at the end. It breaks them down by category, but won't show you how many points you got from a given card. Having played this game a lot in person, this is one of the most fun elements -- ""Holy crap, I managed to get 11 points on Security Fleet."" It also helps newer players get a sense of which cards are strong or weak.

The final issue is the AI is not particularly challenging for experienced players, and it seems to get kinda confused on the DLC maps. Oh well.

These are all complaints, but the overall game is so great that they don't hold it back.

If you've never played the board game, it's unlikely you're even reading this, but TM is a fantastic engine-building board game. There's a ton of potential variation and a wealth of tactical and strategic decisions to make. It also, IMO, has a really great theme that's really well fleshed out by the cards and game mechanics.

However, I've not had a single problem playing 1v1 online, only when I tried a 3 player game. The one 3 player game we tried had all the issues others have said and we all had to leave and return to the lobby several times hoping it would work. Eventually the game did end correctly for what it is worth. The 1v1 matches have been extremely fun and rewarding though, which is my main preferred game setup anyway, hence the positive review.

The UI is super sleek and aesthetically superior to the original game art imo, but does have a few too many layers of menuing required to get the scope of what other players are doing. For example, cards have their shorthand symbols to view them at a glance, which you then click on to view them larger with text explaining things better, but then there is a third layer that gives you literal plaintext of exactly how the card functions. I'm not sure why the first zoom in can't definitively clarify everything for you, the third zoom in seems super tedious when browsing cards, especially at the start of the game. 

Another quirk of the UI is that the log is the the only real way to understand what players did on their turn unless you have the fastest vision ever to see the cards flash for half a second when played. The log is very bulky and covers the entire endgame progress tracker on the right side. I would've liked to see the log be very unobtrusive and more smoothly blended into the rest of the UI, perhaps on the left below the players with the players moved up further near the top of the screen.

Overall this is much more polished and streamlined than the other board game conversions I've played, but the 3+ multiplayer not functioning hardly at all is certainly a huge negative.",1689749231,1689749247,True,5,0,0.596338391304016113,0,True,False,False

In it's current state, it's barely playable. I could list all the bugs I encountered, but that would be as long and vain as trying to triage and solve the open bugs of GitLab, which, although ridden with open bugs (48 565 as of now) does actually bring some kind of value for their customers and have the decency to be transparent about it.

Problems have been reported for years, but devs don't give a damn about it. Even worse than that, each new update is more buggy than the previous one.

It's in such a bad state that I think the Hanlon's razor doesn't apply here: the company behind it is deliberately trying to make the multiplayer experience a living hell.

The company behind it, Twin Sails Interactive, should be ashamed:  both the people of the company for how bad they treat their customers, but also publicly, as : 

* everyone should avoid all of their products considering all the aforementioned issues I reported
* more people should leave negative reviiews on Steam, because it's unacceptable to pay for such a buggy game
* people HAVE to know how bad the situation is, and Steam isn't the only platform (their also have an iOS and an Android implementation, both as much buggy)... this should also be heavily shouted on social media too to protect innocent people for becoming dumbfounded customers of a defective product

The level of disdain for their customers might be a good reason for why the company is staying private. If it would be public, their stocks would have as much value as the value they give to their customers: close to zero.",1688078720,1688079807,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

1 : During drafting, when you're waiting for the other players to choose their cards, 
DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING. You can look at sub-screens only BEFORE you choose.

If you're looking at one when your turn to choose cards comes again, the game locks for you. Your timer goes down, nothing happens and no one can't do anything.
SOLUTION : QUIT THE APP DIRECTLY FROM THE GAME MENU THEN COME BACK. Don't just exit to the main menu. 
Every player may have to do this in turn if they're locked too after you come back.

This is definitely the worse glitch. The other ones are just minor interface bugs :

2 : Your hand disappeared...
Solution : Open and close the ""Cards played"" sub-screen.

3 : The button to confirm a card choice is disabled.
Solution : Click on any card to zoom on it then go back.

4 : Your VP count is incorrect after gaining some.
Solution : Switch players in the upper left corner. The VP count is okay, but the display of it 
only updates after switching back.

5 : Almost all info on your cards have turned into weird squares.
Solution : Quit the app from game menu and come back (this one sucks a bit more, but is 
pretty rare).

Bottom line : still an excellent and faithful digital version of one of the best board games ever made. 
Not perfect, some bugs here and there, but easy to work around though.
And the AI is a bit dumb, even on hard setting. But against humans in public or private online games it's really worth it. 

Now we just need :
a better timer system like in the game ""Through The Ages"", with a short ""turn timer"" combined to a ""reserve timer"",
a better leader board where we can see everyone, not just the top ten plus you...
and the other expansions. I really hope the developers are working on these (AFTER they correct the worse bugs if possible...)",1621325573,1686837718,True,0,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

I tried to use the chat, but I couldn't type anything in. There weren't any options for me to select. So I quit the game.

So to recap - this game is an AMAZING representation of the physical board game. But the AI is/are jerks, and I can't get an online game to work. So start at a 5 star review, subtract 2 stars for bad AI, and subtract 1 star for online play not working. 2 star review it is. My recommendation? Go buy the physical game instead.

This, of course, will not replace the board game, but the adaptation itself is made at a very decent level. Nice animation and card design (much nicer than the paper version). I'd like to see a reissue of Terraforming Mars with the arts of the computer version.

It's with a heavy heart that I must express my disappointment in the development team's handling of this digital adaptation of an otherwise fantastic board game. Over the past year, I had hoped that the developers would take the necessary steps to address and resolve the game-breaking bugs that have plagued the online multiplayer experience. Unfortunately, little progress has been made in this regard.

When attempting to engage in matches against other players, one can expect to encounter frustrating freezes in gameplay that effectively ruin the experience. The only temporary solution is to leave and rejoin the match, which often leads to a repetitive cycle of exiting and reentering games numerous times. This issue has persisted and seems to be rooted in significant networking problems that have yet to be addressed by the development team.

It's disheartening to see such a great board game suffer from these issues in its digital form. While I cannot recommend this adaptation for those looking to play online against other players, it's worth noting that the game does function well when playing against AI opponents. If you're interested in enjoying the game solely for its single-player experience, then it may be worth considering.

I hate this software. Absolute trash. I have lost two games because of it. Once because I ran out of time because I couldn't close a menu and couldn't see the planet. Once because I thought I could solve that inability to close by exiting the game and reloading it, which caused me to forfeit. 
You cannot view your cards during another player's turn half the time. When you try, it just makes the clicking noise and nothing happens. Cannot get the play button ready because, when you can look at your cards, it leaves the card selection menu up without you being able to click something even though it's your turn. You have to click out of viewing your hand then click back into viewing your hand (sidenote: Why is there not a hotkey for that? Why is there not a queue of your intended moves that you can change based on what the other players do during their turns?). Same thing with actions. You have to leave the action menu, open it again, then click the action you want to take, then confirm it, then confirm it again. Probably had a lot to do with why I ran out of time the first time. 

I am particularly annoyed because the most recent update says they fixed major issues. What major issues could there have been that were fixed? Was the software even worse before I downloaded it? 

Suggestions to developers: Make the player's hand less obtrusive, allow queuing, and add more hotkeys to open various menus and make various selections. This design is way too mouse-centric.

This is one of the greatest board games to exist. The online functionality is almost perfect except for the BUGS.

TONS of wasted time. No other board game on Steam have I ever experienced such a prominent bug.

For YEARS the TM team still will not fix their issue of bugging out between turns. It's absolutely absurd to spend 1 hour in a game only to have it freeze and everyone has to quit. I'm constantly getting frozen games. Further, it completely destroys any ranking system.

It's almost offensive with every update - they NEVER ADRESS THIS ISSUE. I understand a bug being around for a few months, but 3 ENTIRE YEARS of the same bug shows they don't really care. They fix a random card ability that wasn't working correctly but not the actual functionality of the game.

- Digital format removes the need for setup, cleanup and general math/tracking of everything that can get annoying in the board game.

Cons:
- Game ruining bugs occur too often for a game that is at a minimum an hour and a half time commitment.
- Time control settings could use a rework.  It sucks to just get kicked out of a game because you missed finishing the last gen by 1 minute.  Especially if it was because the game happened to freeze while the clock was on you.

I'm going to leave my original review below (some of which aged like milk) in the hopes that it can one day get back to what I enjoyed,

A clean implementation that's great for playing with friends.

There are some bugs that the developers say they're working on, but they're broadly workable around and haven't stopped my friends and I playing frequently.

Some negative reviews dislike each player having to own a copy of the digital version to play online. I find this an unfair criticism to base a negative review on as, in my experience at least, each player needing to own a digital copy of a game to play online is standard.

I love Terraforming Mars the board game. It is perhaps my favorite board game of all time; certainly the one I've spent the most time playing over the last several years. Unfortunately, this digital adaptation of the game was not particularly good to begin with and has somehow become progressively worse as time goes on. It is a testament to how good the original board game is that I continue to play the digital version nearly every day, despite this version's many, MANY problems. But with the latest updates, the game has become essentially unplayable, and I now regret supporting this company with my purchase, since their development team clearly is either incompetent or doesn't care to deliver an acceptable level of quality to the customers.

Where to begin?

Several bugs make the game play incorrectly, according to the rules. To name just one example, the Tharsis corporation should only gain income when a city is played on Mars, but with the latest patch, the digital version increases income for the Tharsis player whenever ANY city is played.

Other bugs are just incredibly annoying to deal with, like the fact that if you are playing with the Draft option enabled and you happen to be looking at the cards in your hand when the next round in the draft comes around, the information on the cards in your hand is erased for the rest of the game. You can still check the information by clicking on each card individually, but this can be a huge hassle if you have more than a few cards in your hand, especially if you're playing with a time limit on turns.

Yet other bugs make the game nigh impossible to play. When playing online, the game seems almost guaranteed to lock up at least once before the end. A player will have taken their turn, but the game doesn't advance to the next player. It just sort of... forgets. To the player who ended their turn, it will look like the game is stuck on the next player's turn, but to everyone else, the game will look like the current player is still taking their turn. The only way to resolve this seems to be to have one or more players disconnect and reconnect (which takes at least a minute or two), but even then this doesn't always work or prevent it from happening again. Sometimes the game even gets stuck on an AI player's turn and remains stuck even after their turn timer has run out. In this case, there's no way to finish the game at all, which can be immensely frustrating if it comes after 1-2 hours of playing, when the game is nearly done.

I won't even get into the laundry list of strange UI and design choices that, in my opinion, make the digital version a significantly less approachable and engaging experience than the physical version. I could go on and on about that aspect of it, but in the end, that's just my personal preference. We can all agree, at least, that bugs are bad, and this game, by any account, is absolutely riddled with them.

The worst factor of all is that the development team seems to be actively making the game worse, Many of these bugs had been fixed in earlier patches, only to be reintroduced, along with dozens of new bugs, in later patches. No version of the game has worked completely, but almost without exception, the newer the patch, the more new bugs you can count on appearing. Many of these bugs are apparent upon the first playthrough after a new patch, which raises the question: does the development team just not bother to playtest their game? And if they can't be bothered to do that, why should people pay money for this product, as if it's finished or will ever be finished?

In short, I know Terraforming Mars is awesome, and I can understand wanting to play it online with friends. But Asmodee (or Twin Sails, or whatever they're calling themselves now) does not deserve your money.

Every day there are more bugs, UI is messed up, players disconnecting, completely non-optimized

It's such a pity to ruin a nice board game with this ... this... It is very hard to name what it is. It feels like 1 person and making this game on free sundays. A list of around 200 bugs and glitches can be written down in 10 minutes, examples:

1. you CANNOT go through any details while players are playing their cards as the game will gladly respond to their actions by telling you what they did, while not showing the effects. So if you want to browse through your cards you will always be tabbing out  (although there is a log)
2. UI colours - its either colour blindness or lack of style. Any designer/photographer will point you to the colour wheel and ask ""WHY?""
3. The small SMALL structures on mars have TINY boxes with the NAME but no EXPLANATION (LOGIC?)
4. Icons, icons, icons... you will need a telescope to see them as they are as TINY as possible
5. But ofc you can see A LOT OF space around Mars: because it is interactive, usefull and pretty, right?
6. No reporting
7. Poor ranking system
8. Inability to reconnect
9. While creating the game you cannot browse through games, and vice versa (LOGIC-LOGIC-LOGIC?)

Before 2.0 update, there was a few minor bugs but the game was mostly playable and since I love the board game, I also enjoyed playing the PC game. However, 2.0 is by far the worst patch for a game I have ever seen in my life. 

Instead of fixing the existing bugs like any reasonable patch would do, they introduced not one but several game-breaking bugs. First of all, mac users simply can not open the game after 2.0 update. These people paid for the game and are unable to play it because the new update broke it.

Secondly, when a player leaves a game or runs out of time, AI would normally take over that player and the game would continue as usual before 2.0 update. Now when a player leaves/runs out of time, AI takes over the player but it doesn't play, hardlocking the game. There is no time limit for AI turns so it is simply impossible to continue the game. Imagine being the winning player in a game and opponent just quits and you have to abandon the game and take a loss because developers don't know how to code. This also causes you to lose karma and if you have low karma, you will be forced to play with leavers, resulting in a vicious cycle.

Additionally there is a bug that causes all texts on cards to disappear if you look at your cards in hand while in card draw phase, which is something you frequently do to decide if you should buy a card or not. Unless you memorized all the ~250 cards in the game, enjoy playing them randomly.

So when your new patch causes all these game breaking bugs and a plethora of other bugs, what would any reasonable developer do? Probably apologize first for the bad quality patch and say they are working on a fix. Or even roll the game back to previous version to make it at least playable until the new bugs are fixed. But what did these developers do? They claimed that ""THIS IS THE MOST STABLE VERSION OF THE GAME SO FAR!!!"". I'm not joking, you can't even play the game and they claim this is the best version of the game! The audacity of these guys is simply unbelievable! On top of this they even raised the price of the game in my region SIXFOLD! Because apperently making the game unplayable with a patch is worth charging 6 times the price. 

At this point I feel like the developers did every single wrong thing a developer can do and the only advice I can give is this: Regardless of how good the board game is, don't buy the digital version. And not just this game, I would also suggest not buying anything Twin Sails Interactive publishes in the future either. It is insulting how little respect they have for their playerbase.

I'm a giant fan of the original tabletop version of this title. I was definitely interested in checking out an official app for it, but reading mutliple reviews mentioning how lacking and buggy it was, I halted my purchase of it. It took a sale for me to decide to see for my own eyes if this version was as bad as people mentioned.

Game turned out [i]slightly[/i] better than I expected. It is still Terraforming Mars inside and its charm manages to shine through most of present deficiencies. UI and graphics can look really pretty at times (definitely beats “artstyle” of the original game) and I can definitely see value in having singleplayer bot matches and automated solo mode at the press a button.

Unfortunately, [i]""slightly better than expected""[/i] still doesn't mean [i]very good[/i]. Gameplay does shine through, but it is still buried under tons of bugs, UI mishaps, online game softlocks, graphical errors, baffling design decisions and general lack of polish. For various examples: online lacks option filtering games by player skill level. When your allowed time runs out, you are unceremoniously kicked out from the server - not allowing you to even spectate for the rest of the game. Certain cards don't work as intended. You can sometimes get softlocked in a match and you need to reset back to main menu... and I accidentally unlocked all DLC achievements at once after finishing the tutorial.

I wanted to give the dev team some time, since there was a big patch rumored to be in development. However, my hopes for improvements for the game were dashed when this supposed updated got released… with a list of ""known bugs"" longer than a list of bugfixes.

This board game definitely deserves a better treatment.",1674865562,1674906003,False,4,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The game was in a pretty solid place prior, asynch drafting with friends was a little clunky, but we didn't have to worry about players randomly being booted, or breaking rules as was the case of the troubles of the game's past development. 

2.0 release has stopped any ongoing online games, listing them as ""Not Compatible"" with the existing update. There wasn't any sort of warning, so many players using this app for an online tournament have found themselves having played half a game and needing to start over. 
They have a working Rollback branch, you can toggle on under properties / Beta.  It at least sends out turns to existing online games, we are unsure at this time if this still works with IOS users who are playing the current version with steam users. 

Patches for this game could happen at anytime, and given the track record of the company, without warning to the community, and the games you are playing have no certainty they won't be burned similarly. If players are using IOS, or non steam versions, they similarly can't roll the game back to a previous version.

Players are also reporting widespread new bugs added to the previously functional game, in the lobby when I was failing to load my active games. It's a huge unnecessary L, and I hate giving this product such a poor review after playing for several years and evening convincing other people to purchase the application for tournaments and asynch play. I hope they find solutions going forward, and take more care for the community with future changes that might break things so significantly. I am heartened that they implemented the rollback beta.

I am changing this review to thumbs up. Most bugs fixed and this is overall a good game.

With the resolution available it would no problem at all to present the enitre game state in one single screen.

2022:
This is a decent adaption of an absolutely wonderful board game. The UI is sort of clunky and could be optimized to show more information in a single view. Currently you have to navigate a large number of controls to show information in empty screen areas that would have been totally possible to show all the time. But still, it is a good game and this version does what it is supposed to, though missing most of the expansions.

Unfortunately some recent update have made this game seriously buggy, bording on totally unplayable. Random crashes that persist after reloading the game. Last game I was not even able to start until the game crashed. I am leaving this game for now and keeping to my physical copy. 

Fix the random crashes, fix the UI, and add the missing expansions and this is a very good game. Until then, I cannot recommend this digital version even if I would very much want to.",1633283553,1674334808,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is good, but as many other PC-board games, it should be played online. It is a little too expensive, $20 for this game is a little too steep. You can also play the same game on other websites for free. The design won't be as good and there will be absolutely no possibility to play alone, but it is free...

But there are simply too many bugs currently to be able to recommend it. The silver lining is that the game is still being developed, so perhaps it will get there in time.

I played 7 or so Solo games, and twice my game got into a state where I was unable to advance regardless of what I clicked. There are other many other bugs too, as other reviews have rightly pointed out. I wrote a list as I played, but it's not worth cluttering this review with all of them.

There is no ""Undo""/""Cancel"" button, so any misclick can be devastating. For example, if you buy an expensive space card (e.g. IO Mining Industries), but forget to apply your titanium you end up paying 41 megacredits, which is easily enough to swing the game. That's an extreme example, but misclicks are too common and too punishing to not to have an undo button.

Beyond the bugs, the UI needs further layers of polish to get rid of the inconsistencies. Further, the game UI slows down as more tiles are added to the board / the game goes on.

Finally, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that this game is missing most of the expansions (Colonies, Turmoil, Venus, Big Box), and all of the promo cards. That's fine, as long as they eventually get released. But this game has been on Steam for 4 years.

So another review after the recent expansion of the 2 new board maps, online play is really frustrating because even after years the game has been out, there are plenty of bugs that exist.  Mainly when drafting cards, sometimes the cards don't show up and the timer keeps declining.  Exiting out of the application and rejoining the game mostly works but on rare occasions it does not make the cards show up and causes you to forfeit the game because there is nothing you can do.  Also turns just take too long because of lag depending on where you live.

I just don't enjoy this game when cards don't show up when they're supposed to.  If they fix every bug in this game, this game would be WAY more enjoyable.",1636128854,1668868075,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The developers appear to have addressed many of the fatal bugs, with the few we are encountering not being game breaking.  The expansion maps have added welcome new scenarios, and the underlying game is as solid as ever.  Recommended, and if you enjoy the online version consider trying the physical game (with several other expansions), as well.  

EDIT: I really wanted to edit this review to recommend this game again.  I've really enjoyed it, and they seem to have taken note that two updates last fall (2021) made the game unplayable and then rolled them back.  I continue to play the game as a connection with family and other who live far away.  However, around 1/3 to 1/2 of all games still end in game-breaking failure.  I don't mean a loss of resources or points, but a complete freeze of the game for all players.  It's disheartening, as it seems these bugs have existed from launch and the company has not invested the effort to fix them.  

I will likely continue to play the game for personal reasons, but I can't recommend it to a new player.  I have also made the decision to not purchase digital adaptations of other board games I love that have been made by Asmodee.  I have read that they have existing bugs at launch, and from my admittedly limited experience I am not confident the company will bother to fix them post-launch.  

My recommendation is to buy the physical version of this excellent board game, but please be aware of the potentially frustrating experience you may have if you invest in the digital version.

Playing TM in digital form is very appealing. The design is neat, the ability to see all the tags and points is really useful and the rating system adds some spice to the gameplay.

But everything is ruined by the amount of bugs this game has. It can freeze and you'll have to reconnect (which you may not find out until losing about 5 mins of your timer), it can kick you out and you'll never get back in, it can just break completely, not letting you do anything even after multiple restarts.
Approximately, you will have to reconnect in 50% of your games and in 20% of them you won't be able to finish at all. And don't forget, that even if you are lucky enough to play to the end, each of your opponents has their own 20% chance to drop completely. And then you are stuck first waiting for 20-40 minutes of their timer to tick down, and then another hour playing with a pretty dumb bot in their place. Of course, when creating a match, you can turn on an AI sub for disconnected players so you don't have to wait for the timer, but then the bot will grab the wheel for every reconnection (50% of games, remember?) and ruin quite a lot of turns for pretty much everybody.

On top of that, the game has a pretty awful implementation of the timer mechanic. You can set only one parameter — how much time each player has for the whole game. And when the time is up, the game just throws him out and replaces with bot. No timer per turn (which means, you all will still be waiting for some slow asshole a lot), no +5-10 seconds rule (for fast turns when you are out of time, so you can finish the game when you lost your time on reconnections, for example), no votes for additional time (when everybody need it), not even a possibility to see the results screen after you are thrown out. No option for delay of bot taking over the reconnecting player.

What is good in this game:
- Everything from the boardgame version (rules, balance), although, it still misses most of the expansions.
- Design works. The Mars is beautiful.
- UI is pretty comfortable, only misses the total VP counter for each player, so you won't have to calculate the field every time
What is bad:
- Everything else. Bugs, from minor to astuondidng amount of gamebreaking ones. Timer implementation. AI sub options (lack of them). Social system — devs somehow managed to make it worse in their new website. Now you can't look up your opponents and see their rating, for example.

Online however, is garbage! 
It is very difficult to navigate the board to get your desired information. Once you play the game enough to learn this you are still ALWAYS waiting for it to process your choice. My computer has a 2080 ti graphics card with all other stats matching that tier of computer, and yet the game calculates everything extremely slowly. 
This isn't enough time to really be a problem per se, but online 3 to 5 seconds added to many things you want to do kills your time clock. The most noticeable event of this is at the beginning of each of your turns.
You cant hover over your card, you have to wait for it to signal your turn, then you can open your hand and play your card.

When your timer goes to zero you are kicked from the game, thats it. Even all that I can adapt to, add time to the games I play, sure. Find out the consequences of going over by a second, yup got it, no indication of this, but only took once to learn so fine, got it.

The application is a modest implementation (for solo play) because lacking the following:
 - some more expansions
 - an UNDO system of the last 1-2 actions (before you skip or pass)
 - many optimizations regarding the UI, one example from the crowd: for almost any action you initiate in the game you don't have a back/cancel option.
 - a better AI, especially regarding the points from the effective terraforming (city and greeneries tiles)

There are other BG implementations that have not only a back options for every initiation of an action, but an advanced UNDO system for a chain of many finalised actions (see Through the Ages).

So my recommendation goes more to the design of the game than to the implementation.

Edit: Unfortunately I believe the most recent may patch was the last patch for this game. Appears to be abandon-ware, DLC was a cash grab before development ends. After playing 100 hours+ of games, and then reading reviews, I have the following complaints that have still yet to be addressed for apparently a very long time. 

1. Cheating Exploits (looking back at some of my games, some openers seem quite good, almost too good...)
2. Connectivity bugs during all draft games
3.Issues with rules not working properly in many instances, outlined in detail in many other reviews
4.General UI bugs and glitches

Lack of communication from developer on patch schedule, bug patching priority, or general willingness to improve the game for (after researching) many years leads me to believe this game will continue to have these game breaking bugs. Because the time investment for a single game of TF Mars is much greater than your average online game, bugs and cheating creates a significant time to entertainment/enjoyable trade-off.

Setup is faster; the game monitors your transactions; everything is handy; you can adjust your game setting for expansions or corps or whatever; you've got the cool music and its the classic game...just faster and easier!

This is a resource management game.  It can be played solo, with others online/local, or against AI.  You're primary objective is to (drum roll)...terraform Mars.

You have an income stream that you can leverage to increase production of various resources.  Those resources can be leveraged to produce various environments on Mars (using tiles on a hex board) which in turn increment your three environmental sliders (Oxygen, Water, Temperature).  Raising those sliders in turn increases you terraforming rating...which directly improves your income stream.  Full circle!  That's it! Get it? Got it! Good!

Insert different cards you can buy to improve your production and environment (or harm your opponent), starting corporations, milestones, etc., and you have a great game with high replayability.

In solo play you work to max out the three sliders in a time limit...which can be challenging (aka fun)!
As a group you work individually to earn the high terraforming rating before the sliders are completed.

I like all mechanics and I am experienced player both IRL and online (as you can see from my hours invested into the game).

So this review is just about the implementation of the game.

My previous review was written almost 4 years ago. A lot of progress has been made after it. So I feel like I need to write an updated opinion. I keep old review at bottom, so you can compare my impressions.

BUGS: The game behaves much much better now, and even glitches are rare, almost all cards are working as they should have (some cards can be broken after next update though).

NETWORKING:
It have been updated much, now it will cause less disconnects and provides more stable synchronization. But there are still glitches sometimes and to fix it you need to reconnect to a game session to so it starts work properly. But it can be a pain if you enabled AI to play instead of you. It does stupid thing and a game session is ruined.
And sometimes even reconnects to the game doesn't fix glitches but such is rare.

But there one big problem - sometimes server is SLOW.
You do the action, and nothing happens for 10 even 15 seconds - THE SERVER IS WORKING to bring you response to your actions. It's not very often, but it more often than I would want it to happen. It affects 30m games for me. With slow repsonse I can timeout easily. It's bad.

So, I think networking still needs more work on it, and powerful server to host all the games.

FEATURES:
They added a timer, but only per game. I'm playing only 30min games right now, because without per turn timer - the problems with afk or leavers are the same as always have been.
I still hope one day developers will implement per turn timer/timeout.
Disabling of animations is great additions, but it would cool to see last action of opponent.
I think approach from Gremlins Inc. could be adopted, and it would be great.

I lack settings for colorblind people too.

UI:
It is still terrible, even some automation of actions were added and most of animations can be skipped, so gameplay become much faster now.
But the game still has a large mobile UI that is not appropriate for a desktop game.
And even though I used to it for these years, I think it still can be enhanced for big PC screens.

DLC: 
2 out of 5 IRL addons were implemented. Most simple ones. But the pace of new releases is terrible. In such manner we will see all 5 addons in 10 years after release of original game.
I think for some addons UI is a blocker. There is no space with such enormous UI elements for Colonies and Venus. In fact I wish to they implement Turmoil first, but anyways it's still a long way to go in my opinion.

OVERALL: The game is much more playable now than it was 4 years ago.
I can name it as a good game now.
But be cautioned - each new release still brings new bugs, which arern't so fastly fixed. Meh.

At least now I can recomend to buy this game if you don't have company to play with or $100+ for it IRL.
This one is much cheapper than its real-world counterpart.


--- OLD REVIEW after 40-50 hrs, keeping it for history.
Be warned - it's the WORST UI ever. To make anything in this game you will go through hundreds of unnecessary mouse clicks and endless confirmation dialogs. Having 1440p 27"" monitor you will feel like you old grandma looking though +10 glasses - UI is enourmous - you will have only THREE(!) lines of chat visible at such resolution. Only 4 cards at time. To see card description you will need to do 3 mouse-clicks.
If you don't belive me - look at screenshots, and read discussion board.

Second - it's a mess. It's a bug-o-drom. Not only technical issues like network unsynchronized. Players can't do their turns. Wrong stats displayed to each other. You have no idea what's going on. 
But also they even didn't tested game mechanics - cards are glitched, working in opposite way, etc.

Network games because of UI, leavers and other problems are real butt-hurting expirience. To keep in good mood till end game you need to be very lucky. Another problem, there is no time limit per turn. One can go to bio-afk in the middle and you will need to wait for him to return like 20 minutes. And then there is no notification about your turn.

I rarely write bad reviews but such ignorant behavior of developers, going totally silent after release, and brinning only new bugs with each update make me do this review.

Your cards when it is your turn, tell you exactly which card you can play, but while your opponent is playing, all your cards are grayed out a little so it slows down play because it makes it more difficult to decide on a game plan when you don't quite know which cards you can or cannot play your next turn. Doesn't show how your little scoring all adds up at the end when it comes to the microbes and other little bonuses. (It does break other areas down in scoring though.)

There are a number of game breaking bugs that will simply freeze your online game, preventing it from continuing. If you attempt to leave and rejoin hoping to un-scuff the game you'll never get past the loading screen. I've lost 5 hours combined across the last two online games I've played - both failing within 1-3 generations of the finish. It is too long of a game to risk continuing to try and play in online lobbies at this point and it's not all that fun against AI offline.

A quick internet search shows these issues have existed dating back to at least 2019 - it's simply negligent to have not addressed them by now.

Update: November 2021

The game was recently patched! Good news, right? Wrong. The patch introduced more bugs than it ""resolved"" and these bugs are particularly disruptive including:
1) players unable to end their turns 
2) production gained from certain cards not correctly being applied 
3) cards in your hand (or your entire hand) bugging out and being unable to be played or viewed

All three of those (and that's just what I've encountered in my last two games) are game ending for the player suffering them, causing them to lose Karma in online lobbies.

Update: July 2022

Current state of the game has improved, there are less horrible game breaking bugs and that is good. There are still a lot of issues playing public lobby games, including lack of protection against AFK/griefing players. Playing online games typically requires 2-3 reloads due to de-syncs still and I have seen examples of de-syncs impacting end game scoring - my wife and I played a game with another random person online and on the final score screen her and I saw DIFFERENT SCORES for each player.

There's a log of cards played, but there's nothing to let you know the outcome of choices for their effect - who did they take resources from? How many were lost? Did they gain plants or animals from that card?

I like how this version takes the time consuming turn phase and board set up out of the equation and allows for more strategic, fast paced game play.

It has a good tutorial to teach and otherwise complicated game. However, it really feels like they went overboard in graphical presentation and this means that adding the several expansions that make the tabletop game so rich will likely take a very long time (been years since 1.0) before being released for this. A more simple presentation might not have been as shiny for new players but for this kind of game, the expansion mechanics are so much more important than graphical presentation. The multiplayer is mostly decent but has occasional bugs and hickups as well as an unforgiving timer that kicks players out of the game when they run out. Still, easy to recommend when it's on sale.

Pros: Great underlying game, effective tutorial system, slick presentation. Also available on tablets for if you need a fix there, and appears to be pretty much the same as this version. It's what I've spent more time playing.

Cons: It will be many years before the complete game as it is in table-top form will be released on Steam, likely *because* of the slick presentation.

Edit:  I still love this board game so I'll play the digital version on occasion, and some optimization appears to have happened since my first review.  But after having tried multiplayer for the first time, it's still a thumbs down experience.  In multiplayer, turn timing is very tight and you cannot view your own cards while others are playing- you are forced to watch what they do.  Then on your turn the timer starts ticking and only then your cards are unlocked for viewing so planning a turn ahead of time is very difficult.  Additionally, in a timed atmosphere, the interface refresh system becomes painfully apparent and frustrating as you are locked out from interactions while the screen refreshes all while the timer has already started running down.  And this issue isn't just on occasion, the game refreshes the whole interface after EVERY. LITTLE. CHANGE.

Original review:
Love the game. Playing the hell out of it. I would recommend the game for people that like board games in digital form. Hope the other expansions come to the game. It's nice to play the game, and not having to move all the pieces in the board game version of Solo challenge.

That said, even with today's update you better know what you are doing if you are playing any timed mode under 1 hour of banked time per person. I have lost many games I would have won if not for timing out.

Reasons:
*When someone finishes a turn with a lot actions/or animations, you have to lose like 15ish seconds of your time being unable to do anything until it has shown your opponents moves. 

*Sometimes the game doesn't finish loading your actions when it is your turn so you have to lose time clicking in and out for the options to be available. 

*Many times you cannot look at your hand until some other action is done, which limits planning time before moves.

Still recommend it, but I suggest 1 hour minimum in that case if you are a hard thinker like me.

What I like:

 + Nice to explore the various card combinations that are available.
 + The game is ready at a click of a button.
 + The game can be sped up rather well.
    -> nice for a fast game in between.

What I don't like:
 - The AI just doesn't cut it. While you can lose, especially with more AI opponents, you win far more often simply because the AI makes strange decision and is rather predictable.
 - Game has quite a few annoying bugs of varying severity up to completely breaking your current game.
 - UI interaction really could use some improvement

Unfortunately I cannot recommend this game. As much as I enjoy playing TF, there are just too many bugs to justify this game not being in prelease or beta. The owners of this game should really think about what done means.  Just because a game is delivered to the public does not mean that their job is done. They need to fix bugs after release, and seeing how long this game has been released and how the bugs just seem to never get fixed I have to assume that they don't care. There are many easily reproducable bugs that make this game fairly unenjoyable. 

Also there is only 1 expansion for the digital version.  I will update as changes or updates are made by the developers.

Updated after July Update: Unfortunately I still cannot recommend this game. The quality of life improvements DID help, but unforutnately, they also introduced new bugs, and still a fair amount of the old ones still exist. For instance, your hand randomly disappears during the game, which in some instances requires you to restart the game to get them back...this happens 5-10 times a game...very frustrating. Also if you exit, there is a small chance that the game will just be constantly loading. If your game happens to have AI substition enabled this can be especially frustrating since you will see the AI take your plan and totally ruin it by taking your turns for you. Also. very. very. frustrating.  

Nov 8th Update: Well this patch pretty much just broke stuff, no real quality of life improvements. Its clear that the product owner for this game just doesn't care. I think there needs to be some big changes at Asmodee...this is just unacceptable. Having a game for this long with so many bugs is outrageous and unheard of. 

Recommendations to developers: Please consider adding a review screen option after the conclusion of the game. Sometimes it would be nice to be able to look back at a game and review why things went a certain way in complete detail. Another improvement I would like to see is related to card actions. If there is a card action that the user clicks on, but then decide they don't want to actually do it, there is no way to go back, and the player is forced to add a resource to the card. 

Couple of small defects I found in playing. Occasionally the game will get stuck on the previous player's turn, when this happens the clock continues to wind down, but they aren't allowed to play and aren't notified it is their turn. I will add to this as I find new issues.

Where to start? I [i]love[/i] the board game, but a single online game was enough to leave me shaking my head in disbelief and uttering a string of WTFs. You can read a lot of the sorry history on the [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2432874/open-letter-jacob-fryxelius]Board Game Geek forum[/url], complete with official reply from the Fryxelius brothers on [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2432874/open-letter-jacob-fryxelius/page/3]page 3[/url]. A third-party developer contracted out by Asmodee made a pig's ear of things, and Asmodee are seemingly never going to have the time or money to rewrite things as they should have been.

It looks like the most blatant issues with the game mechanics itself have now been ironed out but, oh god, everything else is still mystifyingly terrible.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]The Bugs[/h2]

Oh, those bugs...

  * Your timer going down during your opponents' turn in several circumstances. This alone is enough to break the game (especially when combined with the default settings that add endless animations) and is shout-out-loud frustrating.
  * The chat 'frozen' at many points during the game.
  * Not being able to see your cards at various random points.
  * Delayed notification of milestone actions. (Not 100% sure, but I was carefully watching to snipe a milestone and it seemed 100% clear the opponent hadn't played it but then it turned out they had a gen later...)
  * Still some bugs with some cards (e.g., cards playable when they shouldn't be) though it seems most of the game-breaking problems have now been fixed.

(Loads of people have also reported crashes and 'broken' situations that result in an automatic loss though I've not seen any yet, and not sure how many remain with the latest post-Nov-2021 release.)

[h2]The UI[/h2]

It feels like this has been designed by someone who has never played the actual board game, and every opportunity to use the computerised medium has been squandered.

  * Why is there no at-a-glance view of all players' key numbers (instead requiring cycling through each player individually and loads of separate views for different things)? Ideally there'd be several alternative views you could cycle through.

  * The default settings are beyond ridiculous: innumerable confirmation buttons for situations where they're completely unnecessary, view jumping to the opponent every time they take their turn (meaning you can't look at your own cards and plan your turn), clunky animations that last forever. In an online game with player timers this is maddening to the extreme. (Luckily you can turn nearly all of this off in the settings.)

  * Why aren't basic choices (such as the initial 10 cards and 2 corps) laid out in a sensible way (um, like just showing me the 10 cards and corps [i]together[/i] on the same screen)?

  * Why does the 'amazing' 3D planet animation fail to have any mouse-overs or popups to explain what the placed tiles are? (The board game had clear stylised icons for a reason... The tile graphics are all style over substance, and many of the special tiles are very hard to distinguish from each other.)

  * Why are there innumerable confirmation buttons for situations where they're unnecessary? (You can turn these off in settings but the defaults are crazy.)

  * Why can't I order my cards (you know, how a physical player would to plan out their turns)? There was obvious scope in the computer format to improve this (e.g., allow you to queue up sets of actions ready for your turn).

  * Why can't I easily see who goes first each turn (a pretty crucial thing since turn order can make or break awards and milestones)? The board game has a great big 'first player' marker for a reason...

  * Why can't you see the end-game state at, you know, the end of the game? (You instantly go to an end-game scores screen and can't go back.)

[h2]Mystifying Design Decisions[/h2]

As well as the decisions for the UI, there are other mystifying decisions for the computerised game mechanics themselves which just scream ""Did you even playtest this at all?"".

  * Player timers for online games. Of course something along these lines is necessary but their decision was just to have a hard time limit (of thinking + playing time) where you insta-lose (and are immediately kicked from the game with no chance to even see the game state) at the second it expires. With the default settings you are virtually guaranteed to run out of time in a 45/60min game (especially if it has drafting and/or goes long) unless you play like a headless chicken. Plus [i]there is no per-turn time limit[/i]. Thus someone that goes AFK requires waiting the [i]full[/i] countdown before they go. Plus no options for the game host to do anything like allow breaks, show discretion in auto-kicks, etc. 

  * The stingiest possible model where everyone must have the expansions to play a game with it. Since 95%+ of online games are with the Prelude expansion, your only hope for a non-Prelude game is to start a lobby and pray someone will join it.

  * No way to reverse an accidental click. Yes, you have to avoid abuse here (though it costs the player time anyway so not really open to major abuse) but could at least allow something like the game host being able to 'authorise' taking a misplayed card/action back (as long as no other action was taken afterwards).

[h2]Summary[/h2]

As it stands, the only reason to play this is if your love of the game and need for available/competent players outweigh the enthusiasm-eviscerating mixture of the above. I applaud the Fryxelius brothers' honesty and passion in their response but it's all sadly ineffectual. I hope Asmodee will pull through with some further patches but it doesn't look like it (and it definitely looks like they are only fixing bugs or doing very small-level quality-of-life changes).",1628980504,1640245581,False,7,0,0.575084507465362549,0,True,False,False

UPDATE 2021-07-15:
Game got updated, the game-breaking bugs were once again not fixed. But hey, we got some new UI!

---

Let me first start this off by saying that Terraforming Mars is my favorite board game. I'll not go into much detail on that, but if it came down to rating the board game, this would, without doubt, be a recommendation.

However, this review is about the video game implementation, which is awful. The game is plagued with bugs, many of them game-breaking, as well as other serious implementation issues, such as an abysmal AI, a time system that is outright ridiculous, as well as an interface best described as ""sufficient"".

Now, I originally thought that this was due to the original developers doing a hack job, but even now that the game is back in the hands of Asmodee, they don't seem to be interested in fixing these issues, and instead aim to push out DLCs to make more money. Bugs that are both common and make the game unplayable tend to get fixed eventually, but there are many long-standing bugs that the community has been clamoring to be fixed that remain unfixed even years later.

A short list of some of the issues I've encountered:

- The AI is absymal. Not only does it seem to have no clue how to properly play the game, it will also readily waste resources on things that do not, and could not possibly, benefit it in any way. It is, at best, a marginal improvement over picking an available action at random.
- Bugs in multi-player are so numerous that having to quit and reconnect to an ongoing game (which fixes some issues) is needed about 2-3 times per game. And this only applies to bugs that can be fixed that way - some bugs cannot.
- Thanks to the above, having the AI automatically substitute absent players isn't really feasible. This also means that if a player runs away from the game, you have to wait out their entire remaining time, which may well be 60+ minutes, because of course the game does not have a round timer, only a single timer for the entire game.
- Trying to explain these issues to new players is also difficult at best, as the chat will randomly stop working, too.
- Finally, leaving and reconnecting too often (because you, say, encounter many bugs) will either crash the game completely, or simply lock you out of the game.

Essentially, single-player is uninteresting, because the AI is ridiculously weak, and multi-player is, on a good day, barely functional, and, on a bad day, literally unplayable. So don't buy this game.

1. [b]Bugs  here and there[/b] . Small cases like someone forfeiting and were stuck in an endless loop of tis bot doing the same exact thing . We had to force ourselves to forfeit and that menas loosing  points for our karma . 

2. [b]Karma system[/b] . There are many cases where i ran out of time and was forced to kicked out which means i lose karma . I understand its to avoid people easily quiting but you have to make some exceptions . 

3. [b]Timer[/b] . I dunno why or maybe it really is just me but I REALLY could not see my own timer while others can see mine and there own . This is the reason why I ran out of time and lose karma . I'm playing this game in a windowed version so that I copuld multiask and i still couldnt see my own timer . 

Overall , This is game is still good but bugs need to be fixed and there are some instances where they need to give options where we can auto-skip stuff like clicking to see what your opponent does and also showing a more detailed activity log about where they reduce some material . 

I still love this game but its hard to enjoy when a few turns away suddenly you get a bugs here and there .

Like many other online games, TM suffers from flaky players who ruin games from going afk. There are no built in mechanics besides karma to counter this problem. AFKs arent detected very well, and theres no way to vote out an obvious afk player. You just have to sit there and wait for their clock to run out or else suffer karma hits yourself.

The game is now mostly playable again. Still, my trust has been damaged.

Update September 2021:
Ignore the below review. An incredibly small patch has made the game unplayable, with me and many others unable to complete a game without random crashes. No communication from the developer.

Though the UI does take some minor getting used to, this game is perfectly playable vs. AI, which admittedly is all I have done so far. I must assume the reviews talking about bugs must be about a previous build, as I did not encounter a single one in 3 hours of play.

I do not know whether the game would be fun if you have never played the board game, but if you have, it is definitely fun to play.

Edit: having played this for almost 10 hours now, I can state that many of the negative feedback is blatantly false. You can look at your cards played, as well as all cards played by opponents.

Pros

-Auto tracks passives for you

Cons

- You should really put a play button on the UI where we see the list of cards rather than having us click on it, zoom in again and click play.


- I think an action phase timer suggested by a user I read in the comments is nice. Max of 3 minutes for two actions to avoid bad losers or stallers

-When time is up, do not just 'hack' a you ran out of time notification. Tally the score up so we know who wins even if we do not complete


Update 10/9/2021: After trying it again after ability to skip animations + skip certain confirmations, it becomes abit more bearable to play.  If they had a neutral button, I would click it. But yes, it's alot more bearable than what it was in the past.

That being said, after a lot of time the game is still buggy, which is a little bit infurating. It's gotten better, but there are some thing that are quite unforgivable after three years since it came out.
Another thing that really bugs me, and the reason for which I can't reccomend this game although I really enjoy it's good parts, is the online is experience is really awful. Matches are timed, like in chess, you've got kinda like a stopwatch, the time runs as long as you're playing, if you run out of time you either lose the game or an AI will replace you. The thing is that a match time length can be up to two hours, so if someone goes AFK and doesn't come back, you may have to wait two hours before you can continue to play, and there's no way of stopping this. Maybe add a turn time limit, and if you reach that time limit three consecutive times, then you're kicked out of play, or something, because I want to play the game and not have two wait forever because someone had to leave unexpectedly and didn't forfeit. oh, also, theres karma for the matchmaking, so if you forfeit a game because it's taking forever, sucks to be you, it reduces your karma, and matches are karma based, so yeah, great.

Turns out there's an arbitrary time limit when you start a multiplayer game. There was no indication of this in the game setup, other than a small box saying ""2H"" that went unnoticed because of the cluttered UI. The timer is a terrible, unbelievably stupid feature to have on by default, and it basically ruined my first multiplayer game. It ticks down during animations when you're not even able to interact with the game. I was playing my first game with my gf, and rather than the fun, chill experience we thought it would be, it turned into a time-pressure nightmare when my time started ticking lower and lower because I take time to make decisions and a lot of the time I didn't realize my turn didn't end automatically, so my timer was burning down.

Suddenly on the last generation I run out of time thanks to the animations (I had my speed set to very fast, rather than no animations, because I want to actually see what happens. I don't think that's unreasonable. With no animations it simply doesn't show you any indication of what changed, which means you have to search the board or the log for what happened), at which point I was unceremoniously booted out of my own game with my gf, and couldn't even see how the rest of the final  generation played out.

I will change this review to positive when the developer fixes the cluttered UI, and at a bare minimum makes it abundantly clear to the player that there is a time limit when taking your turn, it includes animations, and you will be kicked out of your game without any further discussion, not even having the other players vote on whether to kick you.

If you try and reload the game, same deal. (I've heard they actually fully crash on Windows, but I've never on that platform.) So this game is a huge frustration, because you never know when it's going to crash and waste your 30-45 minutes of play prior to that. This does not seem to have been a problem before the last patch, but Asmodee has left the game like this for a month already, despite having reports of the problem, so how can you support that?

Speaking of AI, this game has one of the worst AI-player implementations I've ever seen. They *constantly* do very stupid things.

Finally, the game is also full of samller bugs that impact both the solo and online games. Every time I play online with friends, I can expect my player controls to disappear at least a few times and maybe as many as half-a-dozen. At first I thought I had to reload the game every time, but I finally discovered that viewing the log of plays restored it. Awful.

there are no bugs. NONE. i don't know if they were all fixed in the latest update, but all of the negative reviews that go on about bugs are wrong. the only thing i noticed is that sometimes your cards disappear, but simply clicking on and off ""cards played"" brought them back. it does not disrupt the game one bit. ppl who are complaining that the game is too hard--it's supposed to be. that's not a bug. learn how to play and practice with the ai and then it won't be as hard. 

for online games, it is easy to look at your cards while others are playing and plan your strategy. just click on your corporation on the left side. you can also look at opponents' resources, tags, and victory points (basically everything but the cards in their hand) to determine awards and final scoring. this is actually more transparent than the physical game since your opponents don't have to let you see their resource card or count their tags for you. 

remote play is the only time i experienced frustration while playing, and that's understandable considering i hadn't bought the game yet. everyone on remote play sees the same screen, including when others are choosing their cards, and you're on the honor system not to peek or move the mouse when it's not your turn. (you can still alt-tab out of the window and do other things without disturbing the other players). this means you cannot look at your cards or do anything in the game until it's your turn. it's annoying to watch the recap at the end of each player's turn too because i had just watched it unfold in real time (this happens in regular online play too). the game was still fun to play though. no network issues and no bugs.

there is always room for improvement, so i have a few suggestions for the devs regarding future updates. firstly, give us the option to turn off the recap at the end of each player's turn. while it's nice for people who don't pay attention, it's annoying for those of us who do. in ai games there is no recap so it's your responsibility to watch what they play. relatedly, i would like some kind of notification when it is my turn and i'm not in the game window. in online or remote play it can take quite a while to get to my turn and i do other things while i wait. without any kind of notification i have to keep clicking back on the game window to check if it is my turn yet. this would be optional as well for those who prefer not to be bothered by notifications.

the only other thing i've noticed is that i get the same corporations over and over again no matter whether i play ai, solo, online, or remote. there are like 20 corporations in the base game plus a few that come with prelude so i feel like there should be more of a variety in my options. that's part of what makes the game challenging is to plan a strategy using different corporation perks.

in conclusion, this is as similar to the physical game as they could possibly make it. i LOVE the graphics and dark themes as well as the animations. as someone who often misses out on a lot of great games due to digital motion sickness i very much appreciate the option to turn off the planet movement for a stationary game board. looking forward to the other expansions being added, particularly colonies.",1630438924,1630438924,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The AI is so poor that even playing without any milestone and award it's very hard to lose, and not so hard to win by at least 50 points.
For example, the AI will place its cities near the border of the map, between oceans, ensuring that it cannot have more than 1 or 2 forests around it.

And there are the bugs... buggy cards, but not only, sometimes you have to click several centimeters from where the UI tells you to click because they messed up.
A few weeks ago, the last update has broken several things which were previously working, and they still haven't issued any  fix.
I guess that the most important feature they wanted to add is working fine so they see no reason to issue any fix to correct the bugs they've added.

-Does not show any player activity during turn, only at end of turn
-Menus are very 'herky jerky' and seize control away from the player while they are attempting to inspect elements

I've only managed a very few online games where the game didn't end with someone (or me) crashing out. Problems mainly seem to be with the in-game chat interface and are not helped in that if you crash out you can't rejoin the game you were in. [/strike]

The interface also has some interesting ""features"" since it seems at various points the coders have fiddled the program path when a card or corporation has a particular feature, although these are annoying rather than game breaking (For instance, on my last game playing Valley Tech I was immediately flagged as ""passed"" on playing my prelude cards. Valley has a first turn forced additional prelude card, so it looks like this was possibly an artifact of the code path to force this. Had no overall effect since the flag went on my first turn but was un-nerving. Ultimately in that game the chat stopped working and the client crashed).

[strike]All the above is a pity because it is otherwise a nice adaption - but for me as an online game it doesn't work.[/strike]

Edit: It looks like the last update helped considerably. There's still the niggle that you really need to turn off all the animations etc. to take part in offline play without timing out.

This version is a huge disappointment.

Many cards are bugged.

The interface has so many ""animations"" that drag out longer than this review does, even when set to ""very fast.""  The majority of play time tends to be ""enjoying"" these unsatisfying animations and redundantly accepting notices.  (A *user* has hacked the code to eliminate most of them so there is that.)

The AI competition is abysmal.  I suspect most competent players will NEVER lose to the AI.  I don't expect a human level of play, but AI corporations consistently do things that are obviously wrong.

Playing against humans online allows unethical players to cheat in several ways.  Some are exploiting the bugs and interface, others are using third party cheats.  The game developers and Steam seem to be doing nothing about it.

Small, known bugs have not been dealt with for a long time.  The game appears to be abandoned, functionally, yet the seriously flawed game is still offered for sale as complete.

If you have trustworthy friends who will agree not to abuse the bugs, you could play online and the main drawback will be slow, unnecessary animations.  Be sure to set the timer to allow enough time to play, as when a player runs out of time with no clear warning they are booted from the game.  This has upset many people.

The ""solo"" variant, with only a single player and no competition, is serviceable but gets stale quickly IMHO.

If the bugs are addressed, I'll reconsider the review.  If my name were Fryxelius, I'd be furious that a well designed game has been so poorly implemented.

If you want a computer simulation of this tabletop game, look elsewhere.

From turn one you're making decisions that will effect (affect?) the entire game.  I've only played against the easy AI opponent, but it's still challenging and fun.  If I had a group to play this game with I would absolutely buy a physical copy. 

The one negative I have, is that I couldn't make heads-nor-tails of how to play from the tutorial.  I ran through it twice and it seemed so obtuse that I thought I was too dumb to play. So I watched a Rodney Smith video on BGG and figured it out immediately.  I don't know why, maybe it's because he's Canadian.

It also suffers from the main problem of almost all board game adaptions: the expansions are missing. The Venus expansion could have been easily done, and I don't think people would mind paying a fiver for a DLC.

Or a player ghosts everyone else and all have to sit for 20 minutes while that counter counts to zero so everyone else can keep playing. 3 times in the past 2 weeks I've been forced out of a game within the last few generations because of issues like this, which is agonizingly, infuriatingly terrible.

It's incredibly frustrating to have spent 2 hours building your engine and strategy only for the game to totally freeze.

The online digital version seemed a good way to do that, what with Covid and all.  

It has not worked out well at all, and frankly I don't expect it to get better, based on how some comments from years ago were noting the same issues I am texting my friends about right now as I write this.  Issues like:

- inviting friends to start a game doesn't work (3 people get the invite, 1 person can't see it, the unseeing player's user name appears in the game the rest can see, but the 4th person can't play, and players 1-3 are all waiting for player 4 to take a turn - that happened two games in a row, with two different people as player 4)
- drafting doesn't work, we think possibly because we need to enforce player order that the game doesn't know how to?
- buying your cards for the next generation doesn't work the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd times you choose, again maybe possibly due to order of play issues that that the game holds you to, but doesn't tell you that's it's doing so.  End result is picking from the same choice of cards 2,3,4 times until for some random reason it takes your choices and lets you move on to playing
- ending a game (when it happens) is not at all satisfying.  One person (if you're lucky!) gets to see a summary screen with scoring...everybody else has to rely on that one person to hopefully get a screen shot so we can know who did what
- zombie games in various stages (started but unable to finish?  finished but unable to accept it and move on? forfeited to try and restart a non-buggy instance, but refusing to go away?  who knows?) stick around in your queue, generally confusing you as to what actual viable game you might be able to play.

These issues are happening cross-platform (our group has PC/iOS/Android) so it's not just the PC implementation.  I've played one game where everybody had it via Steam, and we were all on a call together, taking turns right after each other, with no drafting, and that was playable.  Anything less than that level of coordination and it's been a terrible experience.

Bottom line:  in my opinion, do not buy this if you expect to play multiplayer with other real people, especially not if you want to play asynchronously.",1621993119,1621993119,False,3,0,0.556840062141418457,0,True,False,False

For me the main issues are:
1. PERFORMANCE - 'solitaire' game in single mode takes all of the CPU time on my laptop, that I can play SC2 or Fallout 3 on,
2. confirmation frenzy - confirm passing (annoying especially in single mode), confirm STARTING of selling projects, confirm a lot of other things. Let me skip these confirmations, especially when the game interface is so underperforming. The best solution would be ""undo last move"" (single mode) or undo/confirm round in multiplayer mode,
3, Ridiculous time of loading saved game (can be minutes!) or initiliazing a new one (15-30s),
4. Some minor UI issues - the action card tooltip shows, what the action card in general is, instead of providing information about specific card - yet again you have to click and wait for details (even if these details would fit in the text box).

I'm really looking forward for fixes, now I don't really recommend paying 25$ for this game.

EDIT: many of issues have been fixed (option to disable confirmation screen, option for faster animations), game also seems to perform better.

You can't choose your colour or player name in local play.  However, these aren't deal breakers.

What holds it back from getting more stars is lack of features of a video game, rather than a board game on a screen.  For example, a worldwide leaderboard of best solo challenge scores per corporation of all time/this week/today.  Or asynchronous multiplayer.  The developers should look at Ticket to Ride and Agricola.

And the actual game isn't too bad, but part of me wishes they hadn't limited themselves too much to the board game experience. As a video game, you can't help but wish there was the option to zoom into Mars more to better see all the cities and greeneries and other unique tiles you create on the planet. 

But in terms of the core game experience, it's pretty solid. The implementation of all the rules is pretty thorough although at times a little tedious, especially given how you need to confirm so many things including reviewing all the actions the other players have taken during their turns. But at least everything is in place and all the little intricate systems are definitely here.

But as someone who has played the board game extensively, one can't help but feel a little impatient about the other expansions being added. So far we only have the Prelude expansion, which is fun but really one of the smaller add-ons to the game. I'd be happy to at least have the Hellas and Elysium alternate boards added by now.

Improving. After the Prelude DLC the game is improving. You can now remove animals/microbes from yourself to add to higher point cards. After 40+ more games, I've come to realize the automated tally of income, points, and currencies makes games significantly faster. A standard Prelude game with 2 experienced players takes only about 90 minutes. Corporate Era rules with Prelude takes 2.5+ hours. Much faster than the board game because of the automated tally. I'd still like to see Elysium & Hellas boards added along with Colonies.
The game is not a fan of slow internet, and often glitches when speeds below .5Mb/s are reached.

1.  [Removed, as commenters have pointed out it was incorrect, based on the old first edition errata, on page 10 of the rulebook, that has since been rescinded in newer versions]

2.  Your ""hand"" may not render in, from time to time, this may result in you having to pass or force the game to crash and reenter just to be able to play a card.  The work around suggested by one of the commenters only works some of the time.  It will not work at all if your opponent(s) don't have any cards and it is only 50% effective if they do.  The rest of the time, force crashing the game is the only solution.

3.  There is no way to cancel an action once it is discovered not to be a legal move.  Honestly, the game can be somewhat flawed, in it's interpretation of a legal move, yes I can steal resources from myself but I would honestly prefer not to. I should be able to back out of a move before it is completed. (edited to clarify that it is just clicking on the card that forces you to use it, regardless of your intention), perhaps this could be fixed with a quick display of relevant board values or showing all players resource states on the main board as a preview while reviewing the card, my intention here was about how the game buries the state and viability of cards rather than suggesting I would want to cancel a partially completed action, probably could have chosen a better way to state it as I intended to describe a blue card action rather than playing a new card) 

4.  The game does not clearly display all opponents resources on the main game screen.  It is in the actual rules that you must clearly display all players resources and production.  Having to go through each person only drags out turns to check. With tags it's even worse, having to dig two levels deep through needless menu lag (animations) to view.

5.  Some cards only show part of their effects unless you waste time enlarging them, there is no reason not the shrink the icons shown enough for it all to fit.

6.  Not being able to see the opponents moves immediately after they are made, forcing a wait while you watch the last players turn on your own is pointlessly time consuming. No reason to wait for input just to show the last moves.

7. When using prelude, during the first turn/move, other players show incorrectly as having passed for that generation.

There are also just some aesthetic flaws in the game that don't add any other value

1. The shorthand of using >= or <= instead of min or max, saving 1 character space but making the game less accessible to younger players and easier to make a mistake when reviewing cards

2. The tile skins are poorly rendered compared to the world map, the contrast just makes the game appear poorly designed.


In addition, the game is  currently 3 expansions behind and soon to be 4.  Based on past progress, it seems likely there will be 8 expansions to the board game before we see the second expansion here.

- Online crashes often
- A player can decide not to play anymore and you are forced to wait for his entire clock (can be 30 minutes, 1 hour or even more) to continue playing. It is inexcusable that they didn't add a turn timer by now or sth to adreess this problem.
- Lots of bugs
- No news about other expansions

If you just want to play against the AI or solitaire, the game is fine. If you are playing against friends, it's also fine. But otherwise, you really depend on luck to be able to enjoy a game till the end against other people.    

Buy it at your own risk.

Unfortunately, the bad with this is fairly overwhelming at times and plain and flat out unacceptable in light of other digital products available on the market.

It becomes extremely PAINFUL when you spend 2-3 hours invested in gameplay to ROUTINELY lose that investment of your personal time to glitches, crashes, and poor programming.  

The time feature makes perfect sense, however, losing the ability to see the final score when you run out of time on your last game action/turn is INFURIATING. It would be all too easy to allow players who run out of time the ability to witness the game to completion while perhaps disabling their ability to chat to prevent inappropriate behavior.  Also, I don't think you can see when another player is connected or disconnected which seems an easy and obvious feature to include. 

The timers displayed to you and your opponents routinely do not match up. I have warned other players that I see they have 1-2 minutes left and they insist that they see something like 7-8 minutes on their end but they get kicked at the point I see their timer on my screen exhausted. I have also been kicked with 2 minutes left on my timer more than once.  WARNING: If you don't change your settings to fastest you lose a ton of time from the animations.  At first, I probably finished 50 percent or less of games. Now that I am more familiar with the features and their bugs I probably complete 75 percent of my games which is frustrating still.

The game sometimes freezes and it is a somewhat known fix to return to the lobby and then return to the game room, however, this hasn't always worked. My resolve to come write this review came from having to forfeit a game for this very reason.

The chat and friend interfaces are PATHETIC. They literally did the bare minimum in including these features. You can't PM anyone and you can't add someone to your friend list if they are in a game and not in the main lobby. The fact is you are most likely going to add someone while you are physically in a game room with them so this makes zero sense. The global chat also routinely lags in my experience. These issues are not on my end and have been experienced by many as evidenced by other negative reviews here.

All that said the game is beautiful and could really shine with a number of simple fixes. It just doesn't appear that the developer has any interest in working on anything that would improve the experience for its users. The gameplay may have a few bugs (and they have patched some fixes) but IMO the outstanding other issues I outlined are what is weighing this down and probably holding it back.

I don't think I am being overly harsh in my criticism here. I sincerely hope I can come back to this review in the future and reverse my endorsement to a yes and take back my negativity.  Until then I only recommend this to hardcore TM players with tons of extra time and PATIENCE on their hands.  You are gonna need it.

The desktop version of the game is great, its only problem is a huge number of actions to process all numbers of the game.
I expected the online version to be much more convenient. And the problem with the administration of the game is solved in the online version, but!

DO NOT BUY ONLINE VERSION !!!

The application is disgusting. It is already several years old, but critical bugs have not yet been resolved and the moments that spoil the game have not been fixed.

Critical bugs:
1. The game freezes on a dark screen, only reconnection helps.
2. The player's turn does not end, it needs to be reconnected

Not critical:
Part of the interface disappears, it helps to open any panel in the game. BUT! Newbies don't know about this. Sometimes they just leave the game giving up and not asking what to do in the chat.

Inconvenient moments of the game:
Timer! It just kicks you out of the game! It doesn't even let you see the results or the log! It is as if in chess game, after the timer ends, someone comes up and kicks the board !! By the way, the timer shows the wrong time +-5 min
Karma!
These things are not explained, when you figure out what it is, then your karma is in deep minus.
Animation - the animation is very slow, there are a lot of unnecessary notifications in the game, which delays the game. As a result, offline play can be faster than online !!!
The interface is very strange - there is no separate chat of the game lobby, the game starts automatically with the maximum number of players enetering lobby (istantly, without standard 5 sec timer like in other games), an inconvenient general chat

The game design is of course superb, and as such, this is not what I will be reviewing here.

[h1]Clear waters turn grey[/h1]
On my first match with my buddies, right at the end of the game, on the last generation (turn, for those unaware of the game's jargon), the game froze for everyone and we were unable to reconnect and finish the game. Such a delightful evening ruined, from wine to water.

A rare, unfortunate event, I hoped. After all, the game is well rated.

My hope was crushed as I rushed to the boards only to find more people with the same problems, and more.

I also have minor grips with the presentation. Needless animations that interrupt the flow of the game and information that is irrelevant to the player are constantly present, in every generation. The lack of an in-game turn timer is also disappointing.

[h1]Deaf ears, full pockets[/h1]
But at least the developers are attentive. They have a strong presence on the boards, reply to every report and assures us that these issues are being fixed. They show goodwill. That's what I wish to write you, but in all truth, the only sound you will hear from these developers, is the sound of your coins rattling in their pockets as they turn their backs on you, and walk away to sell the next incomplete product branded with a familiar name.

[h1]The feud[/h1]
One of my associates demanded a refund, only to be met with insolent denial. 

""Asmodee will pay for this! Their name shall be disgraced on every corner of this world! Every living man and woman shall hear about their treacherous ways! They are cursed! They won't be welcomed anywhere, as their very feet will turn a land barren! Cursed, I say!"" - I heard him say. Or maybe it was ""Well, my night is ruined. I'll watch an episode of Re:Zero and then go to sleep.""

The multi-player game is a drag and buggy as hell.

Constant annoying animations taking time.
Annoying modal dialogs asking you to confirm anything.
E.g.: even when NOT in hot-seat game, 
the effects of other players are not seen at the same time as the player plays them.
You have to wait for their turn to end and confirm and acknowledge that they ended their turn.
Then you have to wait for the play animations to complete.

Basically, the game ask you to confirm and acknowledge ever little step.
And then it will play a dumb animation to ""explain"" what is happening.
E.g. you placed a greenery, there will be several animations showing how oxygen increases,
how your terraforming rating increases, how the trees grow. Who needs this for the 50th time?

Most of this can be improved in the settings to some extend but...

the most annoying, while other players play, you cannot plan your turn because the game will not display the game state properly.

In online play it will disconnect a player from time to time and there is NO autosave to
restore the game state. This means that that the game has a high chance to just give up on you.",1609540659,1616982887,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

For some reason, when you run out of time you just get kicked out of the game and you can't even spectate or see the match result. AI takes your place and that's it.

Why we should waste our time waiting for other player to make all his moves, and see the animations at the end of his turn? It's our time that is wasted while the animations are playing.

Why can't we change our colors?

Why I'm unranked after 11 games?

Why no Linux support? It even has Android version, so why no Linux?

THINGS TO IMPROVE:

- When another player makes a move, all of your cards are highlighted, so you cannot really see which cards you can play and which not
- While I appreciate the different sorting of the cards (by cost, tage, order, etc.) there should be another category - endgame. In the board game I would make my extra special pile of card(s) for endgame and this is what I am missing in the digital edition.
- The occasional bugs, but nothing too disruptive.
- I appreciate the fact that the Prelude was also released as a DLC, but this DLC is over priced.

Nevertheless, here's some of the things I absolutely adore:

- Great soundtrack!
- Appreciate that everything is managed for me :) Production Phase, Card Tags, Resource Management, etc.
- Good online system and a reasonable AI
- Everything else from the game itself - simply put, a great turn based strategy, resource management and a complex, but rewarding game.

Long version:
UI is clunky and not readable. Lot of important information is missing. You cannot leisurely browse your cards, because every time other player clicks on his own card, your UI is closed, which is beyond ridiculous. There is a time limit for each player, but it's completely out of sync (in-game timer may show me that I have 15 minutes left, but other player sees that I have 30 minutes). Buttons randomly disappear from screen. If you miss an animation, you can't even see details of what other players did. You have to manually click a button to acknowledge that other player completed a turn, and yet you get no notification that it is your turn. Rules allow you to play two actions in your turn, yet you are unable to undo the first action (other players don't see your actions until you play both, so there's no reason not to allow undo). Some in-game texts do not fit into the boxes, so you can't read them. 

The list of horrible UI and UX issues could go on, but this is just a tip of the iceberg. Game is plagued by much more severe issues. There is a limit of 9 oceans to place, but the game cannot even properly count them, sometimes allowing placement of 10th ocean. Some cards are implemented incorrectly, not allowing plays that are allowed in board game.

And even if you survive all UI and gameplay issues, you may not be able to complete the game. It can get randomly stuck during player's turn. Leaving and reloading such stuck game results in endless loading screen. It is a wonderful experience to invest three hours of your life into a match, and not be able to finish because of game-breaking bug.

Pros:
- The UI is good.
- Production values are great, if a bit ostantatious, with 3D globe and lots of bling.
- It properly implements the game rules.

Cons:
- UI bugs in multiplayer, log button dispears, hand card button disapears, etc.
- Weak AI.  Even on hard, one you are proficient at the game, it's not really a challenge at all.
- Many achievements don't work or track correctly.

AI player sometimes bugs the game, especially if there are 2 of them in single game. However there are still issues/inconveniences which haven't been addressed since the very beginning like:
- timer system (there is time per entire game, not single move, so if someone stops playing all other players have to wait 30+ minutes until he will get out of time and finally dropped. Drops are also ultimate)
- animations and confirmation boxes (you decide when you watch animation of other player move by clicking confirmation box, moreover that process consumes your available time)
- not-avoidable drops when time is over (you are simply out of the game even if you have like 2 last move in final round to do)

So problem here devs pushed into their own idea how it suppose to work instead use verified and commonly used implementations, which is:
- animations are in real time, you see them at the moment other player makes a move. If necessary game creator may decide about animation speed for all other players
- each player has fixed amount of time per move + fixed amount of additional time for next moves
- if your time is over you are not immediately dropped from the game, but you simply loose karma and other players may decide if they should drop you or not

You win by max'ing out all 3 values.  Finish a turn or 2 early?  Just run up the score.  Winning is dependent on strategy & getting the good cards when you need them.  There are many cards in the game that should be ignored, since they don't help with terraforming.

2nd game is played against either computer or human opponents.  No turn limit; game ends on the turn when Mars is terraformed.  Terraforming the planet is secondary; objective is to run up the score. 

Basic game play is explained somewhat in the tutorial (one of the worst of any game), but there is so much that was not covered --> Mining, Animals, Microbes, etc., etc.

Early games might take as long as 1 1/2 to 2 hours, because you are studying each card & trying to evaluate it.  Later, game time is about 3/4 hour.

Cards, which add a random element, cost 3 currency units each.  Unsold ones are sold for 1 currency unit each.  So be frugal.  And these cards do one of the 3 things:

    * - Perform an immediate action  (e.g. Increase your plant production by 1.)
    * - Add an Action item.  Allows you to perform a task, such as converting energy to oxygen, each turn.
    * - Effect cards, which create a rule for the remainder of the game (e.g. When an ocean is added, give me 2 plants or When I play a card, it cost 2 currency units less than its face value)

Issues we ran into when 4 friends all played:
1) You have to make asmodee accounts (annoying, but whatever)
2) You Have to specify a time frame, and if one player runs out of time, there is no way to grant more time, the game just auto-kicks and replaced the player with a bot.  Exactly NOT what friends want.
3) Each player sees a different amount of time for each other player (possibly due to different animation speed settings).  This is quite confusing, especially given the harsh auto-kick policy.
4) While the graphics look pretty, and are fairly functional, it is pretty hard to see what others are doing.
5) They added animations to try to force players to watch what others are doing, but every time an animation plays, it closes the windows where you're looking at your cards and thinking about what to do on YOUR turn, making the overall game just take LONGER.
6) You can't disable animations all together.  You have to watch them, but you can change the speed from slow to very fast.
7) There is no UNDO button.  Even during some simultaneous play, like drafting of the cards, if you finish first, and then want to change your mind, you cant, even if no one else has yet clicked their action.
8) In many places there is no cancel button.  Many times once you've selected an action, it will only prompt you with a Submit button, but no other button... You just have to click Submit.
8) There is still a major bug, in that sometimes when it's not your turn, you can't see your own cards.  This can happen when you're drafting or when you're just studying for your turn.  It's super annoying and slows the game way down.

[b]--- Look/Graphic:[/b]
Its very basic. Nothing really special, nothing fancy. But with some details. If you got only a laptop for word and skype, this game will run on it too. The GUI is easy to understand and operate. There are just minor flaws with the cards you draw (See Gameplay).

[b]--- Sound/Music:[/b]
Nothing Special. Turn on your own playlist, there is nothing really unique about both.

[b]--- Gameplay:[/b]
It is a competitive gameplay about colonising the mars. Every player (1 up to 5) plays a company. Every Company has of course its advantages and disadvantages. 
There is the goal for everyone: Colonize the Mars. This needs Oxygen, Water (Ozeans) and an Atmosphere (Temperature). The competetive part is be the best company during this colonization. 
The Game is splitted into rounds. Every round starts with buying 0-4 cards out of 4 randomly drawn cards. This card/s are improving your company stats like producing plants, energy and so on. 
After reaching all of the three global goals (Oxygen, Ozean, Temperature) the game is over. Mars is terraformed. Now the companys are evaluated. There are points for doing terraforming, collecting things like animals (you need cards for that), victory points out of some events, building cities and greenery around them. There are negative points for things like using a nuclear detonation to raise the Temperature. 
The game is very intuitive. So it is easy to start a game from the scratch. 
Negative points are sometimes someone is not synced right (but this is no problem, just close and re-enter the game) and the cards sorting. I bought the game as a boardgame and wanted to play it during the lockdowns. In the digital version you are not really able to sort the cards as you wish. There are just some pre sorting mechanisms. Also during the buying phase at the start of each round you need a few clicks to get to your card or the opponents overview. But this are just minor problems. 
The time for each play move for each player can variated from a few minutes up to 45 days, so there is no rush if you just have little time or want a fast game.

I will break it down: 

1. the interface is not good, most of the information is not visible during the game which can lead to errors from you as a player cause you might forget to do some actions because you need to enter a specific window for them. the entire thing looks like it was made by Apple, really IOS looking. 
in the simulator and real game all of the info is visible all the time, you need to keep track of everything so hiding things in windows and making everything bigger was not a solid move as I see it (and I don't because everything is hidden) 

2. The AI is dumb af, for reals. any player who would play on ""hard"" will see how many dumb, unlogicial. and plain retarded the AI is doing. this is a complex game and creating such a stupid AI is lazy. I feel like the entire AI was half-assed in two hours max. in one game the AI could have put a Commercial District between FOUR of my cities (FOUR!) and didnt, it put it somewhere far away. I was flabbergasted. 

3. I am angry at myself that I paid for this, could have just continued playing in the Tabletop simulator. 

4. You cant cancel or undo action once you pressed them, even by mistake. you pressed a greenery instead of a city? missclicked? go and F yourself. cant take actions back. again this is a complex game and making mistakes is very commun even after 200 games. 

5. I came without expectations and I am still dissapointed. shame. I really love the board game.

Game works well. There are different corporations to play as, so each time you play you may need to take on different strategies to achieve victory. This gives the game a lot of replayability. 

Each player takes turns playing cards which will allow them to build more resources each turn or affect the board in some way or score points. There aren't many ways to damage other players, but you can certainly get in the way of their plans if you're clever. This creates a game where players can't gang up on one person and force them out of the game. This also ensures each player will be having fun. 

There are awards and merits that can be competed for in game. Think longest road in Catan, but with a little more variety and an interesting competition mechanic behind them. Scoring is visible but usually a pretty tight race up to the end. Once the game is over you'll be at the edge of your seats watching the points getting allocated to each player, and the visual indicator of who is ahead moving back and forth until the winner is declared.

Game has been out for 2 years and still these bugs haven't been fixed. One of the worst bugs in the game is the fact that when you are looking at your card as a big card drawn in front of you and when a player ends his turn, your whole deck of cards disappears and you can't get them to show up until your turn comes again. There are also multiple other GUI bugs too which haven't been fixed. The game works but the GUI is just so clumsy and so buggy.

Not to meantion the worst bug out of them all. I set my music volume to zero. Saved the settings. Alt+tabbed out of the game for a while. Came back to the game, music started playing. I smashed the music volume slider up and down and kept saving. Nothing happened. I exited the game, THE MUSIC STILL KEPT PLAYING. I opened task manager. THERE WAS NO TERRAFORMINGMARS.EXE RUNNING!

1. The timer is all over the place. Sometimes it shows 0 and you can continue playing for a bit and some others it shows you have 2 min left and kicks you out. 
2. If you do run out of time you get completely kicked out and have no way of knowing what happened in the end. Usually this happens in the last minutes or even seconds of the game and it would be REALLY nice to still have the option to watch the rest of the game (with AI taking over or even without)
3. Sometimes my cards disappear when others play and some times even when it is my turn. I then have to do some other action to get it unstuck or leave the game and come back which is very frustrating as many times AI takes over and messes it up in the meantime.
4. No undo move can be very frustrating especially to new users who may easily misinterpret a card.
 
Do not recommend because of these shortcomings but it is a game with a lot of online potential if fixed!

EDIT - Was a positive review that is now negative.  Left both.

After 6 hours of play, 1 solo challenge game, 4 online games and one game vs the AI I have found the following in no particular order

1. AI is REALLY dumb in a lot of ways.  Not sure how it is programmed to priorotize but one example that sticks out was the AI funding Banker when its ME production was 2 and mine was 11.
2. UI takes some getting used to.  I have played the board game with friends at the very least 20 times if not 40+.  There is a metric ton of information to follow in this game and once you get used to the UI it becomes pretty easy to follow whats occuring.
3. Bugs with online play getting stuck.  Have seen this come up EVERY online game I have played.  I see the person whose turn was last as Playing... on screen.  They see me as Playing... on their screen.  Sometimes going to the Main Menu and then resuming the game fixes it.  In one case though I resumed the game and the AI had taken over for me so I was essentially a spectator.  This should be absolute top prioroty to fix.  Online play is the only replayablity this game really has.
4. Draft is not in game but is on the roadmap.  I almost didn't buy the game due to this but since it was listed for the next patch I went ahead and picked it up so I could get use to the UI and how things are laid out.  Glad I did, have enjoyed it so far.  If draft is super important to you, you may want to wait.

Overall I am enjoying the game and like the fact I can now play with RL friends that have moved away for jobs and such.

EDIT - Leaving the original review for reference.  I have changed my mind, there are so many game breaking bugs that I cant even list them all.  The Karma system punishes you for other people AFKing right at the start.  So you can either sit for 40+ minutes to have the craptastic AI take over or leave the game and lose Karma.

4 times today this happned.  So people that want to play the game get punished.

This is probably the worst implementation of a board game I have come across at this point and I have zero faith that they will fix all the bugs.  For every bug fixed at least one more is introduced.

Just off the top of my head
The asteroid that cost 36 and gives a play production or 4 if you have 3 plant tags gives NOTHING if you have no plant tags
Predators will not work if YOU have the card that protects your animals, plants and microbes.  So awesome to invest 17 into a card that will not work since you protected your own stuff
De-sync happens so often its about 33% of the time causing negative production in resources

After a couple of plays, I decided that this game was not for me.  About a year later, I convinced myself to give it another go but ended up with the same results.  After a few plays, the game length and party interest just wasn't there.  

That being said, I am a huge fan of the digital platform for many tabletop games.  They often allow you to learn and enjoy a game you are unsure of without sinking a ton of money into it upfront.  Since downloading this version, I have begun to drink the Terraforming Mars Kool-AId.  From my first few plays, just the animations, legal play indicators and the fact that I don't have to play with materials that feel like they are from a Print & Play were a definite plus.

While I still was no fan of the game length as the turns do drag on sometimes, I began to thoroughly enjoy the game as I became a little more familiar with the cards.  WIth hundreds of hours logged, I was completely on board.  I would definitely recommend downloading Prelude as the pre-game bonuses that you get to pick from are great and very asymmetric.  In my experience, utilizing the Prelude cards has cut down on my game time by about 3-4 rounds which converts into a ton of saved play time.  

I have not experienced the bugs that people keep mentioning.  In fact, I have not come across any memorable gameplay bugs since the first couple of update rollouts so long ago.  I do mainly play solo and vs AI but i love this game and would encourage anyone on the fence to go ahead and pick this one up (along with Prelude).",1608215096,1608215096,True,0,1,0.455764055252075195,0,True,False,False

Thematically the players are CEOs of development companies that are sometimes cooperating and sometimes competing to terraform Mars. The game has the perfect balance of luck, long term strategy, short term tactics, and specialization for our group.

Most actions stem from the project cards that are played each round. The random draw of the cards is the main source of luck in the game. This can be mitigated somewhat if playing with the drafting variant, but we find that we prefer the standard version over the draft variant. 

Awards, some project cards, and maintaining prime board real estate provide plenty of goals to strive for. Players must form long term strategies to meet these goals in order to win.

Players also must act tactically to meet short term goals such as claiming a milestone, claiming one of the terraformer bonuses, or sniping important hexes on the board. There is a really good balance of working toward long term goals and taking advantage of opportunities as they arise.

Specialization is also really great in this game. What I mean by that is each player has a lot of options with how to build their corporation through card play, any corporation special abilities, and tile placement. The game does a great job of encouraging short and long term production goals so that you can become a master greenery planter, animal lover, city builder, scientist, terraformer, space explorer, etc. Whether you're winning or losing it is a lot of fun to flood the board with greeneries, or play high value space cards using a mountain of titanium, or watch your animals or microbes slowly multiply, etc. Each corporation can become highly specialized, which opens up a variety of winning strategies.

If you are foolish enough to play it turn-based, it is probably best not to use the drafting option as this is done in sequence NOT simultaenously (i.e. series not parallel processing), which means you can log on and make your draft pick but if it is not your turn to make a pick, then the selection will not ""stick""; consequently, the next time you log on, you'll have to make the draft selection again (and again and again and again).

We set up a WhatsApp group to keep each other informed of when we had made draft selection. Currently, we are using this WhatsApp group to say very rude things about the developers after we could not complete the turn-based game five of us had been playing since October after the software was changed to prepare for the Prelude expansion.

The base game is fine, if you like the solo challenge or playing online with friends (don't recommend randos). You can also play against AI opponents if you like having no challenge.  The AI is so weak that when I play against it, I'll set it to 3 players with the hard AI and if I don't have more than the combined score of the 2 AIs, I consider it a loss.

With all that said, you might wonder why do I recommend it? Well, I have 300+ hours logged on this game.  There's obviously something good about it.  That thing is that it IS Terraforming Mars.

It doesn't replace the table top game, but it is a sub standard replacement. You are better off getting table top simulator and using one of the higher quality tables on there.

Good implementation, although some ""workarounds"" were taken to show the amount of information of other player of the cards you played.  On the real game the eye is way.

In reality this game is fun, has a decent replay value, and is worth what I paid for it.

[h1]Insufficient Tutorials, but Not Hard to Learn[/h1]
Learn by playing. The tutorials are okay for giving a broad idea of how the game is played, but after completing them I still didn't feel like I knew what I was doing. After one or two single-player games, however, I had the game pretty-well figured out. Definitely play the tutorials, but give yourself a game or two afterwards before deciding the game is impenetrable.

[h1]Limited Single Player Replay Value[/h1]
It took only a few sessions to clear all of the achievements in single player, and against the computer most games play pretty much the same. The challenges are fun, and I'm looking forward to more being added (they're in beta at the time of this writing), but this game is mostly for online play.

[h1]Multiplayer Games Take Forever[/h1]
Expect this game to pace like a real tabletop game. When an online game has a time limit of X, you can assume the game will last X times the number of players (three players, time limit of 1 hours; three-hour game). Multiplayer is challenging and very rewarding, but be prepared to commit a big block of time.

UI that appears misses mechanics really hard sometimes. Also some elements seem scaled not correctly (huge card screens and small counters of resources).

Great interface. 
BAD multiplayer experience because of repeated disconnects. 

We've tried multiple times over several months hoping they would fix this problem, but they haven't. Basically, you are playing and the other player gets a ""You took too long"" error and they get dropped, even if their turn started just 5 seconds ago. It happened to us, again, several hours into our game. I can exit and resume the game over and over again, but from the other players side the game ""no longer exists""...even if they were the game instance creator! How can it not find the game the creator created, but I can? 

Did it get sucked into a black hole?
Did a squirrel run off an bury it somewhere? 
Did a Dingo REALLY run off with that baby? 

So...uninstalling with a sad frown on my face. We are very bummed as this is one of our favorite board/card games and here we are in a pandemic and we can't even play virtually. Shame on whoever the decision maker is that is defending the decision to not address this issue. It is unfathomable you have not solved this error by now, reported by so many others.  The house is literally on fire and yet you are busy outside mowing the lawn and working on new DLC content. 

This is a CRITICAL DEFECT for multiplayer gaming.

I just maxed out the AI difficulties and they played reasonably well, though without the finesse of going hard at building engine synergies. There's enough RNG in the game that you're not guaranteed a win.

They did seem to go pretty aggressive towards actually terraforming Mars. Do they not understand that we're there to loot government contracts??

where your main goal is to terraform Mars. You play as a corporation and you can play against yourself and a limited amount of turns, or you can play with a bunch of your friends. The game itself has great mechanics, most games when I play with friends last between 40 - 120 minutes. It's a long game. 
Music is fantastic, so that is a plus. 

Now the game works fine, but you will have issues with the user interface, I have had trouble trying to add friends, but it does work. if I was the developer, I would add messages saying ""x person has been put on your friends list"" or something to that effect. Currently, you have to switch menus to see if that person was added, because the button doesn't have a satisfying effect when clicked. also, when you great a game, you have to click  ""create game"" before the invites are sent out. 

The gameplay flows nicely, plays well, but make sure you set the turn duration longer than 30 min, or else you will run out of time. Trust me, you will run out of time. 

Another issue that would be nice is a persistent log in, I do not like how I have to create another account to play online, I wish I could use my steam account, and not worry about it.

Overall, its a fun game, I would get it on sale for 10 bucks, but 20 is a bit too much for the unintuitive UI and hassle of creating an account.

Unfortunately, the moment you start playing it in assynchronous mode, it all falls apart real quickly. There is nothing that really crashes the game or anything like it, but the flaws are so blatant, that it is hard to believe that there was at least a decent amount of playtesting before release (and no updates came in for the rescue).

Overall, in all game modes, there are some flaws in the design (of digital nature, not board-game-related). The interface is not the best, as you have to navigate multiple menus to see all your stuff (even worse if you want to see your opponents' stuff). It also doesn't show when people steal something from you (unless you happen to be looking at a specific point on the screen where a small negative number will appear after the turn plays out). Worst of all, there is no ""undo"" button, even for actions that reveal no new information on the board, and the turns are not even played in real time: your actions will only be revealed to your opponents after you finish your turn; so why no ""undo"" button? This is simply ridiculous.

Last, but not least: assynchronous play is broken. You have to be very perseverant to keep playing in this mode. The game allows for 45D to each player for finishing a game, which is certainly enough. However, every end of the round you will need to buy new cards in turn order. Even if this part of the game (in real life) can be done simultaneously, you will have to buy your cards in turn order or else the game won't register your purchase and you will have to buy them again. And this is the same if you are playing with drafting. Every card you choose during the drafting phase must be chosen in turn order, or else the game won't register your choice and you'll have to redo it. It blows my mind just trying to imagine how a flaw like this could pass by a simple playtest. One could spot the obvious problem on the first round... Finally, it doesn't tell you when it is your turn, which is a major flaw for assynchronous play.

TL;DR: The board game is very good. The digital implementation is decent. The assynchronous multyplayer gameflow is a complete mess, ridden with bugs that prevent me from recommending this game.

I played half of a game forfeited it, and I never want to touch it again. I wish I could get a refund. The Tabletop Simulator version is better, even with all the fiddliness of TTS, and that's saying a lot.

Problems with this version:

* The buttons in the game keep mysteriously disappearing. This happened to all of us at one time or another. Your hand button will disappear, or the ""Cards in Play"" and ""Log"" buttons will disappear. You can click one or the other and the other button(s) come back.
* You can't sort your hand manually. I'm used to always putting my cards more-or-less in the order I want to play them, and keep cards that have become trash in the back for easy access to discard effects. You can only sort your hand by cost, current playability, and something else.
* You are forced to scroll your hand. You can only see 8 cards at once.
* If you try to use the scroll wheel to scroll through your hand, it just closes your hand and zooms into the planet. You can't even use the arrow keys to slide between the pages of your hand. You have to click the arrows. If you click between two cards or miss the arrow by a pixel, it closes your hand.
* If you have to discard a card, it only shows 4 cards at once in your hand. Why? Why not at least the 8?
* You can't see your cards in play, cards in hand, and your 4 potential new cards all at once; you have to constantly switch back and forth when deciding which cards to keep.
* To see your actions you have to open a sub menu, so it's easy to forget they're there.
* It won't show you what card you just drew from an effect. You have to manually open your hand and sort through it to figure out what the new one is.
* If you are looking at your hand and another player finishes their turn, it closes your hand, shows you a pop-up, and forces you to hit OK to see what they played on their turn and it animates every little piece of it, when all you want to do is plan your own turn. I've had that happen multiple times in a row while I was only trying to see the new card I just drew...
* They eliminated all of the original card graphics in favor of their own graphics. It's actually harder to figure out what the cards do now at first glance. They show different graphics with no explanatory text unless you click on each card to look at it individually.
* The temperature and oxygen meters are either broken or misleading. None of us could figure out if the second heat-production bonus on the temperature track was taken or not. It looked like the line was above the -20 degree mark, but the second bonus was still there, meanwhile the first bonus was hidden after being claimed, so that would mean the second one *wasn't* claimed, but the temp was at -20! Or was it? Who knows?
* Towards the end, we decided to quit for the night, and I passed and closed the game. The next player also passed and closed the game. Then the following player complained to us on Discord that the server didn't record either of us passing and it was still my turn. That's then I forfeited instead of resuming the game to pass.

(1) The digital adaptation is pretty solid.  I don't see any bugs that break the game, and mostly it's loyal to the original.
(2) The digital version allows you to play with friends who otherwise would be separated either by distance or by quarantine.
(3) It's way easier to set up and break down, saving 20-30 minutes.  This especially helps the solo game, which I typically play in 30-40 minutes.
(4) The speed at which AI players attempt to end the game trains you to shorten your long-term plans.  My main weakness with the tabletop version was that I too often made plans that were 3-5 generations too long.

AI: Hard AI for offline play is not at all competent in different corporations, as well as different stages of the game. 
- Enable AI to sell or refuse a card instead of playing it without contribution to own competitive advantage via final M€, TR, VP, requirement as per available milestones (when less than 3 is/are unlocked) and determining factors of sponsored awards (when less than 3 is/are sponsored).
- Randomize AI in terms of amount of plant removal instead of just 1 plant. If possible, randomize seeds as well to prevent hacking.
- Introduce optimized AI by incorporating functions in decision science / operations research for more robust cost-benefit analysis. However, it should be an option with pop-up warning sign because it may require high computational power that some users' computers may experience system crash.

Customization: Unable to pick specific corporation, even when playing Solo. I understand the game rules that it is a random pick, but there is a need for sandbox training for a specific corporation, and enabling it would be an advantage compared to the board version.

Fair-play: As for online game, there is neither time-out in each turn nor clear report/kick button for player who hog the game-play by waiting idly till end of the game for other players to quit and lose karma. 

Online interaction: Lack of interaction features among players other than chat room, like joining game as observer. 

Summary: Lack of critical details in the ending summary, like the map itself and score breakdown of each category.

FEEDBACK - GAMEPLAY

086 - Robotic Workforce: Unable to copy a production box of Fuel Factory that has been played, even when there has been energy production beforehand.

185 - Olympus Conference: Not able to add more than one Science resource to the card.

Forfeiting and afking will lower your Karma, which will keep you out of certain lobbies.
You have a limited amount of TOTAL time for your turns. Which has its own list of pros and cons I will cover below. 
***ACCELERATING YOUR ANIMATION SPEED IN SETTINGS HELPS***
Pros:
If someone afks eventually they will be booted and an AI will take over for the player.
Games all eventually end.
Inspires people to stay focused on what they are going to do for their next turn.

Cons:
The timer can range from 30 minutes to 3 hours per player. People usually pick between 30 minutes and 1 hour but often 30 minutes or even 45 minutes is not enough if you play a longer game with less terraforming. Especially if you play a lot of blue cards that demand additional actions for every generation.

Biggest one: People can afk and you have to wait for their timer to hit zero before the game can continue. Huuuuuuuuuuuuuge issue. Luckily it happens less and less as you go up in Karma, but its still a drag when you are into a game and you suddenly realize you have to wait 28 minutes for a player run out of time.

If you run into the above issue and forfeit because you don't want to wait, your Karma will be lowered and you will not be able to get into some lobbies.

That's it. I'd recommend it still despite these issues. Its very well made, the graphics and cards look fantastic. Its awesome to play with friends when we can't meet due to real-life events.

Oh! If your cards disappear, click on ""cards played"" then go back. They will reappear. Its a known bug.",1594453982,1594454005,True,80,0,0.868753492832183838,0,True,False,False

It's nice that everything is automated, but there's no way to speed up actions and animations. This can make the games take quite a while to get through. 

It's all functionally there, but the UI could use a little more streamlining, as you need to click around just to see what your opponents are doing or have done. I wish there was a way to display everything on one screen. That being said, there are a few nice QoL things such as showing the fully tally of where everyone is currently ranked regarding Milestones and Awards.

If you plan on playing this game with friends, I highly recommend using the scripted version in Tabletop Simulator instead. It's way easier to work with and almost automated as completely as this game.

Foreword: if you don't have time to read the review right now, just read the Discussion thread titles to be up to date with the problems of the community. I still cannot recommend this game. After a long time the Fryxelius family responded to the concerns of the community but it's not clear, how the game is going to improve in the future reliably.

I like the board game and I was really excited when I heard about the digital version. You can reduce the gameplay time since you don't have to manage the cards and distribute the resources at each generation by yourself. You can focus purely on the strategy. 
While reading about the game since the release date (almost a year from now) I hoped that version 1.611 would be fairly playable. I purchased the game beacuse I expected smooth gameplay but there are still some annoying glitches and inefficient game design. Some needless features are extending the playtime considerably. A digital version of a board game should have the opposite goal. Moreover there are many missing features that this game should already have. So sad that it feels like that there wasn't any beta test before the release. You still need to recheck during gameplay to make sure everything is happening by the rules. I would recommend this game to enthusiasts only as yet. If you are a TM fan, familiar with the rules and you don't get surprised if you stumble upon with some bugs you're welcome.
It's just a question of time for this game to be a great adaptation. But now I would call version 0.611 at this level (instead of 1.611).

First of all the online game requires free account registration at Asmodee.net. You can register inside the game but be aware that the account has to be activated. You won't get any warnings about this. You can play with an unactivated account, but days later this account will be deleted. You get reminder by email only, so make sure you have it. This is how I lost my achievements, ranks and karma level after several hours of play.

UPDATE (1.1205): the following patches progressing real slow. The online game got worse. Half of my recent games and my invested time were wasted because the players sometimes got stuck in the research phase and even the AI cannot take over. I uploaded a screenshot about the bug of the month. Beyond regular technical problems there are still many know issues that does not allow to play the game by the official rules. The bugs are still there, some cards are still not behave properly. More than a year has passed since the game release with a 25€ starting price. This is a pricy early access experience. Keep hope alive.

[u]General problems, bugs, missing features (solo and multiplayer) according to 1.611 patch[/u]

- One of the the biggest issues of the game:
Each player has a preset time quota for the whole game. There should be a time limit / turn option. It could make the game faster and more reliable. If somebody quits and the AI doesn't take over in the very beginning of a 45 minute game, it's all wasted. You have to wait 45 min to have your turn IF you are the next one. You would quit in this case and you may lose karma as well. If your time quota is up, you will be kicked out from the game and AI will take over. At least the game should let you to observe passively how the battle ends.
You cannot watch your opponent's move in real time. The game plays back the moves consuming your time. ""Of course"" after you click on the confirm dialog. When this window pops up there is no any sound effect and unless you click OK, you loose time from your quota. This pause is unnecessary (again) and forcing you to stare the screen constantly to make sure you don't waste time. If you pass early in a generation, you still have to stay tuned considering that you have to confirm the playback after every finished action rounds of each player. Strong nerves recommended.
There is a lot of unnecessary confirmation dialog boxes popping up where you have to click OK to continue. Therefore you cannot chat, review your cards to plan your next move without interruption. At the last production phase there is an unnecessary announcement concerning the available greeneries. Same thing when you cannot convert greeneries anymore. Too many forced clicks everywhere. You cannot go to from the scoreboard to the main menu with a single click. Yes, another confirmation dialog again...

- High CPU/GPU load during play. Unreasonable hardware requirement compared to the visual experience.

- All functions / buttons of the game should be operated with customizable keyboard shortcuts as well. Browsing cards with mouse wheel would be much comfortable. Cannot jump among form fields with TAB.

- Cursor are not visible in the form fields after clicking on them unless you type at least one character.

- Buying 10 cards: if you click on a card on the second page (to read the details) and after that you go back by clicking outside of the card surface you get yourself back to the first page. Same thing happens if I click on ""View game state"" button while you're on the second page of the 10 cards.

- If you click too many times on your OR other players deck it disappears permanently from the UI until the next action. In worst case, you may lose a whole generation if your deck is missing and you cannot do any other action to ""fix"" this.

- Sometimes the game doesn't show what resources the players steals from the others. 

- Even in Hard mode AI is to weak.

- If an AI take over a player it should be indicated on the UI.

- Feature suggestions:
It would be nice to have a preview to see where I can place a specific tile before I use that card.

Tile information on Mars surface would be handy on mouseover to identify the actual area (Natural Preserve, Commercial district, Mining rights, etc.).

When a card being used, the animations should be merged. While we see the actual card somewhere on the right side of the screen the animated effect(s) of the card can be shown simultaniuosly.

The main user interface needs some optimization. The player interface should always show the player's resources, cards, tag, VPs, etc. When a player would like to check an opponent's parameters it is better to have them under it's corporation icon. The corporation icons shouldn't have change places. They should be marked with numbers, 1, 2, 3... depending on who's first in a generation.

Collecting / spending microbes or any other resources a bit complicated. Too many needless clicks to do that.

- The timer around the corporation icon is to small.

[u]Online gameplay specific problems[/u]

- The last player who joins to a game, doesn't have a chance to chat with the others because the game automatically starts. There should be a confirmation button for everybody to let the players indicate to each other that they are ready to play. The second problem with this that the public game creator / host cannot filter / kick out ""ignored"" (trolls, personally banned users) players who is actually join the game.

- Chat: ingame window can only be opened / closed with the chat button on the top left. Unconfortable. In the chat window the player's designated color/corporation is barely visible. You know who is playing a corporation if he/she write something. Cannot send message with ""ENTER"" button in the chat room. Wrong time (12 hour offset) in the chat window. 03:06 instead of 15:06 for example. Copy/paste general hotkey is not working in the chat window. there is a lot of space to improve the online game menu and chat system to make it more user friendly. Chat window should have a smaller ""widget"" version that can be placed to the bottom.",1568573586,1592586422,False,186,2,0.904950797557830811,6,True,False,False

The wait between players moves is exhausting: at the end of my turn I often get a drink, make a coffee, or get a bite to eat. I play on my phone while I wait for my turn. Furthermore, the organization and arrangement of the cards in your hand is cumbersome and awkward. There are quick buttons to arrange your hand by tag (but it's how the game chooses to organize tags, which may not be how you want to), by playability (but you have to keep reorganizing it every time it's your turn), or by cost (I don't even use this one). I often have a strategy in mind how I intend to play my cards and I cannot freely organize my cards. As a result, I may miss cards to play, or play them in the wrong order and lose benefits. So many things are good about this game, but the designers should have kept things simple and focused on effective gameplay.",1591117711,1591206909,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

- For the rules, apart from the tutorial, the game defers you to the official PDF rules. There is no in-game rule pages, or glossary or rules search.

On the plus side:

The flow of the game and the controls are good. It's always clear what's happening and why.

Lucky Hammers went under so it really is up to Asmodee Digital to re-hire someone to fix the myriad bugs and implement much-needed quality of life updates, but the game feels abandoned.

If you really love Terraforming Mars and you want to play digital then be aware of a few things:

- You'll play 20 provisional games before seeing a rank but you'll still start at 1500 regardless of how you perform.  
- It's common to see players abandon games leading to 20+ minute waits for their clock to run out (this is true even in mid-high karma ranked games). 
- The interface is really bad. No audio queue for when it's your turn so you can't tab out. You must also constantly click ""okay"" when a silent prompt comes up indicating another player's turn has ended. You are forced to watch each step of every action that was taken by an opponent with no way to skip. 
- In draft, you can't look at your hand, milestones or awards, or any player's card tableau without being jerked out of it by the draft prompt window, which will then bug it out.

Other game-breaking bugs I've noticed:
- Certain action cards can just break entirely and kill your engine, like power infrastructure to name one. 
- I've seen players lose plants that were protected by protected habitats. 
- I've been kicked from a game due to timeout because an [i]opponent[/i] ran out of time.
- Sometimes the game just gets stuck with no one able to take any action and force the whole table to abandon.

 I love Terraforming Mars boardgame. This implementation shows promise, but Through The Ages has set the bar way higher.

- The resolution is weird, cutting away log and some buttons and I can't change it.
- Current interface design does not allow you to see your cards in hand at all times, which is a bummer since your cards form majority of your decisions
- there are unecessary steps and confirmations (end turn after second action, cofirm selling patents) 
- the card text is cut even when the card has plenty of space to show it in full. Clicking (i) feels lame
- there are bugs in cards and rules implementations

I wish I could be more forgiving, as I want to see more boardgame implementations happen. I belive the promise is there, but not the delivery.

1. The game is still very buggy. I had a frustrating game where I accidentally clicked on an action to steal a microbe. I was the only person with available microbes but had a card preventing theft from myself. We were a round from the end but couldn't finish the game since I couldn't finish the action and so finish my turn.
2. Bugs can be worked around once you're familiar with them. More troubling are some design choices that make the game less than enjoyable to play. Here are my concerns:
(a) The game forces you to watch other players take their turns, but once their turns are finished. This is frustrating for two reasons. Firstly, it slows the game down. Every turn is played at least twice - once for the player that took the turn and once for each player watching the action. Secondly, the game interrupts whatever the other player/s is doing, which can be very disruptive if you're trying to work out what card you're thinking of playing or checking what tags other players have.
(b) The game has far too many reminders of when you're passing / choosing an action. For players familiar with the game, this creates an additional and unnecessary delay.
(c) The game does not allow for easy game awareness. Whilst you're forced to relive every turn as it happens, it is cumbersome to see which cards players have already played, which actions have been played by a player in a given generation, or what actions can still be played (a important consideration, for instance, when you're deciding whether to add an animal to a card when there's a predator card held by an opponent.) Clicking on each button that takes you to the players tags or available actions slows the game down, and while you're considering your options the game interrupts you to show another player's turn in action.
(3) The multiplayer features are frustrating. None of my friends have worked out yet how consistently to start a private game and invite friends to it. The work around is to set-up a public game and have your friends join that, but that isn't ideal.
(4) The game resets card choices unexpectedly. For instance, if you've chosen your cards after choosing your corporation, but then wish to revisit your corporation choice, you lose all cards that have been selected. This led to a comically annoying restart in a game recently where one of the players began the game having accidentally selected no starting cards after changing their corporation.

Generally, the game would be much improved by increasing the amount of information that is available to every player when looking at Mars. An event log, that is automatically populated when players take their actions, for instance, would greatly increase game awareness without interrupting whatever other players are thinking about or looking at. Similarly, ""hover"" features, that show you information about players simply by hovering your mouse over the player / their ""board"", instead of having to click would be helpful.

On the positive side. The game play is beautiful. The cards and the board have been improved upon in their online format as compared to the cards and the board.  The unexpectedly tacky ""pets"" card remains as garish as the original, which is a huge plus.

None of the previous criticisms are unsalvageable. I don't know whether the game is still under development, and to what extent, but these problems could be fixed. I hope they are. With the lockdown, boardgames are proving to be a great way to keep ""seeing"" friends, and TM is a favourite. Hopefully the necessary changes will be made. I’ll update this review if and when changes are made, and hopefully change it to a recommend in the near future.

I contacted/followed up with Asmodee tech support on the following dates in 2020:

My gaming group continues to experience digital Terraforming Mars bugs.


I wish that Asmodee would please respond to my original bug report, please, and put someone in contact with me to address these new issues.

The total defect list, so far, is below:

List of Digital Terraforming Mars Defects:

1) ""Online"" button stops working. I have to restart the application to fix it.

2) In-game chat window stops allowing me to type anything. I have to go to the main menu and back to fix.

3) During a 5-player game, individuals have to keep choosing his or her starting cards every time they resume. Also, no players show ready, including the one that already chose. Sometimes, upon resume, many times I only see the planet and background. No other options are on the screen and no notification exists about the game state or who's turn it is.

4) Blue card actions related to power use/tags stop working once another power-related action is taken. The system does not allow you to take the other power action(s) at all until the next generation.

5) -4 megacredits on the project card should be optional. The player using this project card is forced to remove 4 of his or her own Megacredits.

6) The hand of cards including # of cards disappears and cannot be selected. The same view occurs for all players. Going to the main menu and back will correct.

7) I cannot see any of my opponents or my cards. No card count is shown either. The area were the card hand is normally shown, I see black, empty space. I have to leave my game and come back to see any cards.",1585766036,1589125402,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It provides decent balance with enough chance to make things interesting.  Playing a single player campaign against the AI in this version seems to mostly work alright as well.  However, the multiplayer UI is extremely confusing and buggy.

First, in the lobby when building a game to play with friends, the friend selection does not work intuitively.  If you click a user and click the heart icon (which, in the background, toggles their status as a friend / favorite), the icon does not change at all, indicating whether they are truly favorited.  You have to exit the user screen, to to your friends, and search for them.  Additionally, the search box at the bottom of the players search screen only searches within the current context.  This makes no sense- it's extremely unlikely that I would have SO MANY PEOPLE favorited that I couldn't simply scroll to find them.  The expected behavior is that it searches ALL players.  Everyone I play this game with hits this problem- they think that I'm not available to add to a game because they are searching only in their ""favorites"" context.

Second, the game HUD needs a LOT of work.  Your cards will randomly disappear and be unavailable to you to review until your turn comes up.  If you click ""cards played"" and then close the modal, sometimes you can get them back, sometimes not.  The UI asks you to click EVERY TIME someone completes an action to see their action played out.  At the very least, make this an option to be automatic- there's a log if I need to know what happened.  This makes the game significantly slower and more cumbersome.  In the final plant conversion phase, the game gives informs you that you can convert plants (click ok) and then, even if you don't have any plants, you have to click done.  The done button is on the left where your turn and pass buttons were.  There is NO reason for this interruption.  If I can't do a conversion, simply post a message saying that and move on.  Don't make me hunt for a button while everyone else waits.  Additionally, the modal at the beginning is unnecessary.  You say at the top of the screen that we may convert plants.  An extra click is ONLY annoying at this stage.  Lastly, the UI will CONSTANTLY interrupt you while you have modals (such as your current cards or milestones) open for review to prompt you to click okay because other players are playing.  STOP IT.  Maybe post a message in a corner and wait for me to close what I'm doing, then you can show me what they did.  If I'm trying to think through game moves, having my cards unavailable between turns because the UI is buggy and then suddenly disappear when I finally get a good look at them is maddening.

My weekly gaming group likes this game a lot from a mechanics perspective.  The game design is solid; but, the digital version need SIGNIFICANT work.  From ridiculously obvious bugs to terrible UI design decisions, the application works to get in the way of the inherent fun of the game.  The publishers should lean on the developers to fix these issues, as they are a blight on an otherwise fun game to play.",1588731226,1588731226,False,17,0,0.685387074947357178,0,True,False,False

Unlike some reviewers, I did not encounter any difficulties in stability or performance in my 70 hours of play. 
The game has a decent tutorial and anything you missed can be learned through play or by looking it up in the Rules section.
If you prefer playing this game alone, the game offers AI opponents of various difficulties and a (sadly mediocre) Solo mode with no opponents.

[b]What is the game about?[/b]
You run a large corporation and it's up to you (and up to 4 competitors) to TERRAFORM MARS! Terraforming is done by raising atmospheric [u]temperature[/u] (by producing heat, importing gases or crashing meteors), raising the [u]oxygen[/u] level (artificially or by planting forests) and creating [u]oceans[/u] (through water import, digging or crashing meteors). Any time you perform one of these actions you increase your Terraform Rating, which helps improve your income and is added to your Victory Points total at the end of the game. You can further increase your final score through tactical placement of city tiles and forest tiles, by populating Mars with flora and fauna, by funding awards, and by playing specific cards. The game ends once Mars is fully terraformed, highest scoring player wins.

Some minor gripes:
- AI never sells their cards at the end of the game, despite the fact that money is the tie breaker and any money is therefore better than just having some useless cards on hand at the end. In the board game it's become standard practice but here the AI never realises it.
- The Solo mode ignores victory points and only focusses on actually terraforming Mars to be victorious. Sadly, a large portion of the cards in the game are geared (fully or partially) towards victory points, which means those cards are greatly underpowered or even useless in this mode. Now I understand this is literally copied from the board game so it's hardly something the developers can be blamed for, but it does mean this game mode feels clunky and unbalanced.
- Solo mode lacks a difficulty slider. The default difficulty (complete terraforming in 14 Generations) is good but I'm sure there are plenty of people who would prefer a lower of higher difficulty, like 13 or 16 Generations. Again, the board game doesn't have it so the developers of this version, Luckyhammers, can't be blamed.

Thankfully these problems don't detract from my overall enjoyment of the game, and I therefore highly recommend it to anyone up for a complex game with interlocking mechanisms and a great sci-fi theme.",1570272578,1587545332,True,2,0,0.535616934299468994,0,True,False,False

Since there are no cubes to push around and no cards right in front of you, you have to play different.  Most information is just 1-2 clicks away.  Sure it would be nice if you could just glance down and see other peoples production and cards, but just click and you can find out. I haven't found any cards that have errors.

HINTS:
-Change the time limit to 10 days and then you don't run out of time.
-Make sure you turn off AI swap if you or your friend looses connection. Re connecting isn't hard.  You CAN jump back into the game.  DRAFT mode is available.
- Call each other on speakerphone (or computer) while you play.  I have only played vs computer and with one set of friends live.  MUCH more fun if you can interact with voice.
- Friend has iOs version and you get a notification during the game (or Battery low) it loses connection. But it was ok, he just rejoined the game. (I have Steam version on wired ethernet, no kicking off here.)
- Standard game is set for 30 minutes? The shortest game I have ever played is 3 hours.
- Turn on confirmation to end turn.
- There is no undo button. Just be careful what your plans are.  If you messed up, just beat the other players anyway.  =^)
- Yes you have to create another log in with Asmodee Digital.  It helps you reconnect and lets you play with your friends.  Or find others to play with online.  It's fine, just do it.

             I have played Terraforming Mars on ""Local"", using corporate era rules and drafting, against 4 other BOTS.  The main challenge is for me to win nearly every game, and do so by as large a margin as possible.

A qualified ""no"". I have only played with the BOTS so far, in 5 player games. The ""competition"" is much weaker than normally when I play with people. It's good for beginners wanting to practice  before tackling good players, and I do have the challenge of seeing how much I can win by.  But it's very predictable: oceans go up very quickly and temperatures are always the last to be completed. The bots often fail to claim milestones and often fund awards prematurely so that I can  overtake them in the last round or two. I have sometimes scored 30 points in those two categories alone against 4 ""hard"" opponents, who in general play the same way, and no better, than the ""easy"" ones. They do things that are incomprehensible, like buying cards in the last round that offer little or nothing of value, or playing tiles in unexpected places. So the value in this game is to cut down on my own overlooks and miscalculations. I presume this will sharpen my game against real opponents.

                 Another thing: I seem to get a lot more good project cards than in real life. Against live opponents, I am noted for tending to play very few project cards, and for doing a lot of standard projects, particularly greeneries and cities. Here i play dozens of project cards, seeing so many good ones? Is this all deliberate, my getting the most popular cards every other game, all the while seeing actions no real player would take?

                  In short, this game has been an entertainment to me as I try to cut down on my own mistakes, and a solace in our stay home days. But it's not remotely like real life. I can recommend it to some players, but to many I would not.

One of the biggest challenges to the tabletop game is remembering what discounts you have, what resources you can pay with, what actions are available, and so forth.  This digital version takes care of all of that and speeds up the game significantly.  

HOWEVER, I do wish that some of the expansions would be available for this game as I find that the base game feels lackluster after playing the fully expanded tabletop game (Turmoil and all).  When playing the tabletop version of TM with all of the expansions, it takes FOREVER, four to five hours depending on the amount of breaks/interruptions.  The addition of the expansions in the digital game would be amazing, as some of the expansions really add to and change the overall gameplay, for the better.

Highlights card requirements well

Bad Points:
Default for online play is 30min which is incredible short for people new to the game or interface
Having to click through to the other players display to see their production and resources is particularly annoying when playing a card that lets you steal other players resources, a mouseover would be helpful.

This app however, is SO annoying. So many terrible design decisions that make it actually more tedious to play on the app than to play with a physical board, and usually the opposite is true.

Here are some suggestions for how to make the app less incredibly annoying:
1. Allow undos during the turn when no hidden information is gained. Accidentally clicking the wrong button and not being able to undo can ruin games. It's not like my actions are conveyed real-time to my opponents, so it should be trivial, and table-stakes, to implement this.
2. Stop animating everything for no reason, it's visually distracting and the game is super laggy on my laptop.
3. Make it easier to see people's cards. When I click on another player, stop showing me the board, and instead show me their cards laid out legibly.
4. STOP AUTOMATICALLY CLOSING MY HAND WHEN I'M LOOKING AT IT.
5. Why is it 3 clicks to use a card like fish?!?! There are no options. Stop making me make decisions that aren't decisions. When I use fish it adds an animal to fish. It doesn't need 2 dialogs confirming that yes, I'm adding a fish, and yes I'm choosing the only possible place to put the fish.
6. Allow drafting starting hands. It's unbelievable that you can't do this with the app.
7. Make it clear which direction cards are being drafted.
8. There's really enough space to show tag counts on the main UI, there's no reason to have to click through to a dialog.
9. Please please please improve the performance or provide more options to turn down the graphics settings. This is a board game, why is it pegging the CPU on my laptop at max?!?!",1586756375,1586756375,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False

The serious downfall of this game is playing with other humans. It is maddeningly slow and painful. There's no chat built in so you must have your own discord or similar voice chat. There's no good notification for you the player as to when you can take a turn, so you dismiss multiple useless dialog boxes that ding after you click ok. Who thought that was good design?

- The game was pretty good at animation and graphics
- also the sound
- compare to tabletop version -> playtime is faster because you don't need to count the money by your own so that's good to get rid of some human error

What I don't like
- the experience of tabletop is better because you can skim roughly at your friends resource -> and it's harder in this version -> I think those devs can improve it by expanding the space around left size UI of turn order to fill in more detail about player's resource
- those information should be more present at first glance -> it's too much tabs and popup to click -> with some of the element that no need to click after open a popup (like extra resource and tags) why don't you try use hover instead of clicks ?
- for the short version of comment : quick view of everything (tags / actions / resource)

1. The chat engine needs fixed.  When you are typing and someone completes their turn, it overrides the chat box.  very difficult to chat and play.
2. There needs to be an undo button, only available on your turn.  Sometimes you click on a card and play it (let's say it requires you to remove one resource from a player) only to find out no one has that resource yet, and then you're forced to remove your own, thus wasting the card, and your MC.
3. When you are viewing cards to prepare for your next turn, and someone completes the turn, it turns off the card view, very frustrating.
4. During someone else's turn, you cannot view which actions you've completed.  Difficult to plan.
5. During someone else's turn, when viewing your cards, it doesn't show what you can play and what you can't, like it does during your turn.
6. the City tiles need to look different than the other tiles (i.e. industrial center) so when you play a card that raises a resource based on how many cities, it's easy to see, or when you want to place a city, it would be good to see those different tiles so you know prior to buying a city whether or not it's a legal placement.
7. The cards in your hand often disappear when it's another player's turn.  I know you can click on cards played and then back, but it's annoying.
8.  If you run out of time, you should be able to stay in the room and watch how the game turns out.
9. there should also be a turn time limit.  When a player disconnects, you are forced to wait out their entire clock, to avoid quitting yourself.
10. When viewing a card that gives you ""x"" number of resources based on opponents tags, it should display how many tags your opponent(s) have right next to the card, it takes too long to go looking for it, and just when you get there, usually the turn is complete and you have to click and start over.

Those are the top 10 complaints I have, I know there are more, but let's start there.  Developers, it should be easy to fix these, everyone I know complains about most of these.  They don't ruin the game, but they make the game longer and annoying.  Please try to help us out.

I have a few problems with the game, mostly from a standpoint of bugs and some control issues. Every so often I'd loose the ability to see my hand during other players turns, I found I could fix this from opening my played cards then selecting my hand again but it is a bit annoying. The placement of certain cards isn't always very obvious and there's no way to take back something you're about to do, once a card is selected you're committed, this is somewhat frustrating since you can't preview where you can place cards beforehand, or if you accidentally select something in the standard projects you're committed.

I have some serious issues with how the multiplayer is handled, the total turn timer is nice but a per turn timer would be better as there are a few issues. Players can hold a game hostage when losing and decide to not end their turn and I have to make the choice of sitting there for however long until their turn clock runs up or leave. A vote kick or a host kick option would be a preferable in these cases.
 
This is compounded by the fact that if the game is close and the timer is running short you just get booted from the game, full stop. I've had games with 10 seconds on my next turn but I couldn't pass or skip it on the *LAST TURN* because the animation of your turn coming up takes longer than that. You don't get to observe the game after your timer runs up, AI takes over for you, you don't get to see the score, or anything. If it simply just passed the rest of your turns that would be 1000% better.

And with so many actions simply just using time, you get heavily punished for playing factions that draw a lot of cards or take a lot of actions as each action takes about another 10-15 seconds to perform from opening the window, selecting, activating. It adds up a lot, this with other animation times not freezing the clock are incredibly aggravating.

That said, there is still room for improvement.
* The UI still drags the player away, whenever someone completes their turn.
* Also the history, while much improved, does not show all relevant information.
* The player list in game is a bit rough, and needs improvement regarding:
  - One's own remaining time is so small, it is barely readable.
  - The information given (regarding resources and production) could be included, to make switching to other player's perspectives redundant, which would greatly improve the game's flow, because then all information would be visible from one single view.

1. Invite system - It uses Asmodee's proprietary system, which you have to make an account, in order to play online and even to invite friends. On top of that, it isn't very intuitive to use and invites can often over lap if people create new games, which dont close out until all players forfeit that game.

Fix: Let me people invite others using steam. I don't get how this isn't a staple by now. Also, if the host leaves their own lobby, the game should be closed down as well. Again, something of a staple in other games such as Armello, UNO, Tabletop Simulator, etc.

2. Global timer - This game gives all players a global timer that they must use in order to make their ENTIRE game's plays. E.G. if you get 1hr, you can use up to 1hr to make your choices, even if its your first turn, until you get replaced by AI. This allows for people to AFK and makes people wait several minutes until an AI eventually replaces them.

Fix: Add a 2nd turn timer such as 30secs per action with a ADD TIME function if you really need time to make a decision. If the player AFKs, it should automatically skip their turn or end their turn. This should last up to 3 to 4 Generations at the very least until they are replaced by AI. This discourages AFKing for any reason, something this game shouldnt do. No one should have to wait 30+mins to play again because someone AFKed.

3. There are no DLC/Expansions available for this game.

Fix: Add them for a reasonable price.

Asmodee please fix your game. Until then, I would suggest you buy the actual tabletop version as it is much more interactive/fun due to the issues that plague this version of TM.

I own the board game and have played many, many times. I tend to prefer board versions to the digital versions and can safely say that I look into purchasing digital versions of board games only when I want to play the game against the AI.  With that said I won’t be able to comment about online multiplayer play and very, very rare ever recommend paying full price as I find it hard to shell out a lot more money past what I have spent on the physical versions.

After a couple plays I found this is a very good port to the digital realm.  The play is smooth, the AI is not completely incompetent, and the UI isn’t a complete cluster****. Most of my issues comes from the UI, I find the game to be a little too pretty at times, the trees and water sometimes make it difficult to just glance at the board and derive all the information you need, but at the same time I can appreciate that it’s pretty. The most difficult part I had with the game play is interacting with cards that collect or apply tokens.  It’s a little clunky and very easy to make a mistake with, or forget the blue cards.  It took several plays to get used to it.
The game does a decent job with pace and showing you what the AI does on its turns however I, personally, still run into the same problem I have with digit versions of any game which is it can be difficult to track and pay attention to what the other players are doing.  I find myself often not even bothering to pay attention to what they do or how their board looks, only checking on them if I have a card the directly interacts with one of them. However maybe that’s not bad thing. I find my scores to be much higher here than against my friends.  So I either pay too much attention to others strategies and not my own (possibility), or my friends are much better than the AI (good possibility), or I just suck at this game (very good possibility).
In the end the ultimate question is; does the UI recreate the game in a good enough way to play while scratching that itch to play when your friends aren’t around? Yes, though I still recommended you get it on sale. 

TL:DR – “The digital version of that game you own, or your friend owns”
-	A good port of the board version with decent AI. If you’ve played the board game but can’t get your friends over enough to play more this should hold you over to the next game night.

Learning curve assessment (Because every day I’m getting older, more stubborn, and this screen has too many colors)
-	Since I played this after learning on the board version I haven’t gone through any in game tutorial. If you have not played this game then I highly recommend you head over to Boardgamegeek.com and watch a video or two on the game play to get a good feel.  As far as games go it’s not heavy, but it’s not light there are a ton of cards but what’s nice is it isn’t a game that knowing all the cards really changes how you play. It also not combo heavy.

Highs
-	Nice to be able to play against the AI when I can’t get a game night going
-	AI is decent and adjustable
-	UI is not over cumbersome and game looks pretty

Lows
-	Game sometimes looks too pretty and is distracting (at least to me and my old eyes)
-	Blue card usage is clunky and not the most intuitive
-	$20 is a little much to shell out if you already own the board game +expansions. Worth $20 if you’ve only ever played because you play on your friend’s game.

It has tremendous replay value and even when things do not go your way there is still a feeling of accomplishment.   Does the computer version stack up to the tabletop game?  Somewhat.

The game is pretty looking but and the UX has improved from patches in the past could of months.  Speed of play descriptions and so on are much better.  I'd like to see some other things in place, like a warning that you have actions available.    Also I'd like to see all your cards in one screen.  Lastly there is plenty of room in the UI for showing info like tags, which are something you'll refer to a lot.

My biggest issue with the AI.  First issue with the AI is that it doesn't know how to play the map and is very predictable.  I can 100% guarantee you that it will place oceans ASAP with the two card spot going in the first generation.  Likewise it places tiles in weird and un-optimized spots, particularly early.  It seems to do a better job when the choices are more limited in late generations.  Likely there is some bad programming as to what spaces are good for the strategy the AI is trying to use.  

As well the AI is very predictable, there are certain projects it cannot resist. Likewise some project have little payback that the AI could use for standard projects.  Even on expert level, the AI can be dispatched with relative ease.

That said even if it plays the board above everything and poorly  is that it doesn't do much with a bio/animal/jovian types of wins.  You do not have to play the board to win (though it helps and i tis much harder in the base game).  It'll play the board even if it shouldn't and open up some very easy (re too easy) standard project cities to plonked down).

The multiplayer like all Asmodee games is garbage.

So why do I recommend Terraforming Mars on Steam?  Even with a few mistakes or weirdness it is fun.  It is a good trainer for playing on the tabletop.  You'll get a good idea for what works and does not.  That said the AI doesn't seem to hate draft much, if at all. Be prepared for that at the table.  Nobody will be handing you plum cards to use.  Hopefully the devs will make improvements and chunk in expansions, as TFM now is quite vanilla.

As a note, it would be nice to see the two Mars maps added as DLC, that would be a huge addition to the base game right now.",1557195451,1579390920,True,2,0,0.542809665203094482,0,True,False,False

The UI leaves more to wish for in several ways, many inconveniences but not game-breaking.

Despite early reports of massive bugs, the Devs seem to have fixed most of them and it plays smoothly now.

I do have a few minor issues though.
 First, there's no way to tell if your opponents have a given resource or not without clicking on them, a task that is occasionally impossible based on where you are in your turn.  By the same token, you can't tell what resources they're producing either.   It makes the cards that allow stealing more of an exercise in memorization rather than game play.   In tabletop, such things are readily visible to all players.

Second, if you attempt to play a Local game with more than one player, expect a very slow game, as the system needs to display every action multiple times for every player.   You take your turn and see the animation, then the game shows all the same slow animations to your opponent.  Same thing happens on every turn, so the more people you have around, the longer it all takes exponentially.

Mostly, these are just gameplay issues that are due to the transition from tabletop to computer, but I can't help feeling like there would be a far better way to handle this.",1579080806,1579080806,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While it's true that head-to-head the AI isn't super challenging, if you play with several of them it gets plenty crowded.

[list]
[*]pretty ui + colored borders around hexes is nice
[/list]

cons (ui/ux):

[list]
[*]basically a UX disaster - every time you need information to make some decision, it is hidden underneath some menu (somewhere).  and you have to manually click through that menu (no hotkeys?).  it's nigh-impossible to figure out everything that's going on at a glance.
[*]the ui is quite visually distracting - everything is moving around and vying for your attention
[*]chat box holds three messages at a time. no ability to copy/paste chat messages (sorry discord users).
[*]not obvious (maybe impossible) to figure out who's going first next turn
[*]not obvious who funded which milestones/awards
[*]tag icons are embossed in such a way that they are visually ambiguous
[/list]

cons (functional):

[list]
[*]no ability to choose order of resolution of triggers on cards (you should be able to do this, per the game's designers - it matters in certain cases like with giant ice asteroid/arctic algae in play)
[*]you can target yourself when you are allowed to remove resources from any player (i know you technically can, but /why/?)
[*]no undo button
[*]logs are a nice thought but have no compact view
[*]you get prodded constantly by pointless notification dialogs
[/list]

** UPDATE: 1/10/2020 **

fixes (for the aforementioned issues):

[list]
[*]none
[/list]

more cons (ui/ux):

[list]
[*]when choosing initial cards, the game board is completely blocked and you can't see it.  you can only see five cards at a time.  you cannot see your corporation card when choosing cards (hope you got all of that memorized)
[*]you're allowed to drag mars completely off the screen. why?
[/list]

more cons (functional):

[list]
[*]turns don't automatically end after choosing two actions - you have to literally click ""end turn"".  when you click ""end turn"", or ""pass"", you must click through a mandatory dialog: ""Do you want to end your turn?"". ""A player has completed a turn. Confirm to view the result."" notifications fire off every time someone finishes a turn.  you will spend most of the game clicking through notifications that cannot be turned off.
[*]when playing a steel/titanium-discountable, the default amount steel/titanium you are prompted to use is 0 (enjoy accidentally playing these cards at full $ price)
[*]when a player plays sabotage, you cant see who they sabotaged, not even in the logs
[*]click ""quickplay"" and it turns it's draft variant

- playing online with a smaller group of people you know (no hackers, no AFK players)

I can imagine much better user interface and some things are completely illogical (you cannot see played event cards in the log - if you miss the animation, you're screwed).

Also, the timer for online games works really badly - only overall game limit can be chosen. Time per turn plus extra buffer (like in Through the Ages) would be more useful, now you must wait for dozens of minutes if someone goes AFK.

For the time being (middle of December 2019) this is at most a beta version. I've played 80 hours with the  Steam version, mostly offline.
Unfortunately there was no UX expert on this project. 
It is very very slow, even the fastest version. It's very annoying. 
If you click on the Actions button (too quick) then all of your actions are inactive. (But this is happening with the Standards projects also)
Let's say you have a lot of active Actions, and you click on one of them. When you realize, that you need one microbe to that card to be able to raise the oxygen level, but you have no option to go back, and choose your other action which will give you a microbe to this card. 
The clicks are ""lazy"" and unsure. You can never be sure that your click was casted.
Sometimes when you spend 8 heat or plant to raise the temperature or the oxygen level, you are not able to spend again until you play a card (if you have money for that) or you have to go to the main menu and resume the game...
If you have 7 actions or more, you have to scroll between them, but the scrolling is very lame implemented.
You can not see your own cards when your opponents are playing. (Let's say you took 2 cards from your second action, but you can not see what cards did you got till the next round...)
The whole gameplay is much worse than the real boardgame. This version is hiding the information.
You can not see the cards, your enemy cards. You have to click one by one your enemies and their tags to count  how many tags they have. 
Even the temporary scoreboard is not summing correctly the points, the final scoreboard usually have 1 point in plus.

I really do not know if the developers have any ideea about how to make the gameplay easier to the player...




ps: I recommend to try ""Through the Ages"" if you want to see a way much better gameplay implementation.

Two of the first 4 cards I put into play didn't work. The effect was ignored by the game. I gave up when a third bug was discovered half way through my first game and requested a refund. This game is clearly in Beta and should be marked as such.

Earth Office and Earth Catapult were the cards. Neither one of them worked, though the cards were listed under Effects.

EDIT (response to nate_asmodee): In that case the cards clearly need to show they are being discounted. I'll be glad to give a positive recommendation once that change is made.

This is a great adaptation -- it was easy to pick up on, and has the same gameplay feel of the board game , and adds even more atmosphere due to the music / graphics. The best part is that it reduces the gameplay time because of all the production / parameters being tracked automatically -- I can finish a game in 30-45 minutes!

It won't -completely- replace the board game because for multiplayer, I much prefer a physical board, and even for solo, it doesn't [yet?] have all of the expansions like Prelude, Colonies, etc. If those are ever ported over though, I'll probably never play solo on the physical board game. 

I was originally skeptical of getting this game due to the reviews concerning bugs, but after playing about 6 times so far, I haven't encountered anything noticeable that was game-breaking. There was a couple times where some actions were greyed out when they shouldn't be, but it was just a timing thing -- I just had to wait a few more seconds and then re-open the action panel, and they became available again. Other than that, I didn't experience any crashes or things that caused the game to not be finished. Maybe it's because they resolved all the issues in their most recent update.

- after playing a card, effects and actions are detached from card. you can see name of source card.
- its hard to find how many microbes/resources on card you have.
- result of opponent play you need to watch on your turn.
- if you select any option (eg. try to play standard project or action) while watching opponent actions, your options are disabled, you need to exit to game map, and enter again (i lost many minutes waiting)
- AI on easy/mid/hard has the same difficulty, but some rules are enabled/disabled for them.
- if someone ""steals"" your resources, you didnt know which card the resource was taken from (you can check your status later, but if you dont remember counters - its your problem)
- you can see only one player resources at a time. you need to switch between players if you want to compare.
- and many more...

- Not being able to view your corporation card after game start.

- AI locks up and performs the same action over and over.
- Enabled AI takeover when a real person runs out of time or forfeits causes synchronization issues.
- Game forces you to leave match and rejoin to play your turn.

Couple of things they'd need to add for me to keep me playing once the initial new game infatuation has worn off:

1) End game stats - I think most players would appreciate being able to view the final board state and more in-depth VP stats (which awards/milestones were won, VP by city and greenery, etc).  As is, the game end feels a bit anti-climactic... ""here's the final tally, goodbye"".  No chance to relish a well played game or view how a strategy played out in detail.

2) Pause - Similar to above, not being able to see the game state until a full turn cycle is a bit frustrating.  And even then, the log function leaves a bit to be desired.   There should be a way to see what was just played AND how it affected resource/board state, preferably with a pause function.  *Might be best for solo only, but could see how this could be just as useful if done right for online.

3) Counters on variable effect cards would be quite useful.

4) Undo button would resolve above and be generally appreciated for solo players.  There are times when I'm thinking six moves ahead and may mistakenly play a card out of my intended order.  Imagine this wouldn't be preferable for most online games, but could either be a game option or only available to solo.

5) Expansions would be nice.  Could pay for some of the above improvements being made?

If you have played the physical version at all, you will have NO trouble jumping into this digital version.  I see people complaining that the animations take too long.  Really??  Maybe 1-2 seconds while it shows you what resources you or your opponents just received.  IMO this is something that other digital board games are generally lacking.   This game at least takes the time to show you what is happening on your opponents turns.  You can also easily switch between the view of your ""table"" and your opponents to see what all they have on the go.

I don't have any issues with the UI.  I think it's very well designed and allows you to do any action with ease.  Some people complained that they were unable to use the actions of certain cards, so they just ignored them.  I'd be willing to bet they simply were not allowed to use said action based on the rules of the game.  Everything is very clearly laid out and if you can access something it's because you don't have the resources / tags to perform it.

For my first online game, I didn't change anything because nothing is explain and I was thinking ""default is good for beginner"", like all other games... ah ah ah

5) It was during my second game I found where was the timer. LOL. It is on your corporation icon. YEAH, that 3 pixels that show you ""23M"" that means ""You have 23 minutes to play before we kick you out without warning"". Good job.

6) During the first move, when all players are choosing their first cards at the same time, only the timer of the first player will be reduce. I mean, that's fair ? No ? If you think this is stupid then you are not a developer of this game.

7) The game never tell you who was the target of ressources/productions reduction. You have to spend time looking each player to guess who was the choosen one... this is NOT a detail !!! I want to know rapidly what happen during the game to prepare my move.

8) When it is the turn of another player, you can not look at your own cards to prepare your next move because of all that popup messages ! Remember : ""click click click""

9) No undo button.

Today, playing this in 3 players game take 2 hours. With some LITTLE improvement we can do it in 1 hour and half or less.

This game is playable, you CAN start an online game and finish it.
But it is painful, so painful I do not understand why ?
Did anyone making this game tested it before ???

Too bad, the board game is great and this one can be really good, but too many little thing make it hard to enjoy.",1563024342,1563316617,False,68,4,0.80088651180267334,0,True,False,False

The sound is even better, it fits very well to the whole theme of the game. Very subjective, but I give big up to the graphical and sound designers. I have also enjoyed the gameplay.

The horrible: The game is unplayable online for me. I crash in the area of 1-5 times a game. Because of that, I have timed out in every single game I have attempted to play online. Many times it lets me reconnect, but actions I did (the game showed the ainmation and all effects) were either undone or played in a different way than my intention. For example I placed a ""Capital"" tile next to an ocean ""successfully"", then the game disconnected and when I returned it was placed in a totally different place. Most of my ""gameplay"" was therefore reconnecting. Once I fell asleep waiting for the game to reconnect and it run all night.

The pretty bad: The game menus and popups are poorly made. They are unintuitive (most do not allow enter/escape and must be clicked), pretty ugly (subjective). The game interrupts you very often in the middle of an action. For example, I want to prepare my turn, so I look at cards and tags, only to be interrupted when another player makes an action. Every single time I must click again at my corp, the cards, etc, ... only to be ""kicked"" out by another action of a player. Should be fixed by a ""Do not disturb now"" tickbox (or similar) in order to view all actions in bulk, when wanted.

Other: I have not verified other bugs and rules breaches as others (I am not nearly as proficient in the game to make sure). I would like to give the game benefit of the doubt, but I cant.

Result: 2/5 max, which is a pity, the game has so much potential. I am requesting a refund and hope that the game gets fixed and I can purchase in the future. Now it is unplayable, while commanding a very, very steep price.",1562863995,1562863995,False,23,1,0.677634716033935547,3,True,False,False

Fantastic game. Love the solo challenge. Developers promise more to come and I hope they deliver.

As of now, there are some bugs and the game is a little rough around the edges. You can't read all the text on the cards without multiple clicking to open up a description, it seems like a popup description when hovering over the card would have solved this. During the card selection phase, I couldn't find an option to view the planet to see if one of the cards I was considering could work (place a city between 2 cities on the board).

The interface is fantastic;  the game organizes everything for you during the game.  It tells you exactly how many tags of everything you have, which cards you've played, everything.  If you click on your opponent, you can find the exact same information (what cards they've played, how many tags they have, etc.).  When you go to buy an Award, it tells you in real time how you rate vs the other players for that particular award (especially for Landlord, you don't have to go through the pain of counting mid game or at the end).  Also, you don't have to deal with subpar game pieces or little things that go flying if you bump the table.

There are some things that need to be fixed:

1)  There really needs to be an undo button.
2)  There needs to be a better online system:  matchmaking seems relegated to organizing via chat, there is no real kick-timer and most games are set to 45min for each player to take their turns during a game.  having to wait 45min or more for a player to be replaced by AI is brutal
3)  The animations need to be sped up.  The bells and whistles are nice, but in the end, we just want to play the game and try to win, not watch a movie.

I looked at the comments then and chose not to buy it until fixed. So I waited, and waited and waited and I eventually read an evaluation saying basically : if it's on sale and you like the board game, go for it.
So I went for it and here we are, 30 ish hours later:

Positive :

It's giving me my Terraforming mars fix. I like the board game. 
Cards seem to all function as they should ( with 2 exceptions, as far as I noticed)

Negative: 
There are a couple of things that could be done to improve my enjoyment of the game but as far as I'm aware, there are no plans to change anything. The main issue for me is :

*It is faaaar toooooo sloooow !! Now, I don't have the latest shiniest gear but we're talking about a digital board game, here. I shouldn't need the latest shiniest  gear to run it. (digital Through the ages runs perfectly). The animations take forever and there is no option to skip them. I've tried multiplayer twice and it took me hours to finish a game. You're essentially staring at your screen, waiting for other players to play and you need to stay in front of your screen because you must click an OK button in between each player's turn, otherwise, the game won't move forward and everyone will just wait, doing nothing.

This is the multiplayer's experience I've had: You stare at the UI for a loooong time, then click ok. The game then shows you what the other player played, then it's an other player's turn, you stare and wait some more while he or she stares and plays, then you click ok, then watch animations telling you what this other player played, then (if it's a 3 players game), you play your two actions, and then the whole thing starts again and you stare some more until the end of a round.
And there are many rounds. 
So multiplayer is a lot of staring. A LOT of staring. You'd think you could use the time to think about your strategy, but when that is done, you still have quite a lot of staring time left. So you stare, and wait. and play your two actions, watch your animations, then wait and stare, and watch some more animations , and wait and stare. So I stopped playing multiplayer.

Played a bit with AI. Started normal with 1 opponent and won, played difficult with 2 opponents and won, played some more but 
a) I won all the time because these AI are not good at playing this game.
b)I had the same problem of games being too slow

So I stopped playing with AI and played solo challenges.

And that's what I do now, I just play solo games. And even playing solo, you need to click so many times just to perform one action that it's getting boring. 
And there's no personal ranking in solo you play.
And you can't choose your corporation ( And I know the board game rules say you can't, but I don't care. I want to be able to choose my corp when I play solo. Would you play CIV V without the ability to pick your civ ? Or street fighter without being able to pick a fighter?)
And you can't change your color
And you 

So, anyway, IF you're in desperate need of a TM fix (without ANY expansions : no Venus, no colonies, no prelude, no extra corps, no extra maps, no nothing, just the original version) and you're actually looking for something to do with your money AND you have a massive amount of time on your hands: go ahead, buy the digital version.
Or if you don't really care for multiplayer and good AI, and you just want to play solo , go ahead, buy it. (or maybe try solar settlers, I like it and it's not boringly slow)

Playing solo against the AI or doing the solo game is great. The game looks great and runs fast and easy to get through game.

The huge downside and I do mean HUGE. Is playing this game online. While the game set to run smoothly and quickly playing against the AI because you get to see their cards being played. This feature isn't added to online play. You get to watch the cards get played twice. Once while they do it and a second time to make sure you get to know why? It also extends the times between turns. Taking about 10 seconds extra before allowing a second action to be taken. Adding a huge amount of time to each action. I played one online game and five rounds took over an hour and a half. Playing the board game in person with friends - we beat the games in an hour and a half.

It's great for the solo challenge. You can work your way through it quickly and easily and as it's only your decisions you're playing on it makes for a fun game. The same experience as the solo board game version, except none of the physical setting up. You even get some pretty nice music and some fun noises (except the noise when you try to take another action in a turn where you've already had two - ouch to that noise).

The main game vs. AI was fine to start with. But the way they play becomes incredibly predictable and all you need to do is focus on city placements and getting greenery down on the board to beat them every time.

Perhaps I'm expecting too much from a PC version of a relatively complex board game, but it'd be nice if there was some surprise to playing, rather than me accurately guessing the next move of each AI player before they happen.

I didn't buy the game for the online matches, so can't talk for how that functions. It might be more fun to have the human element of surprise and less formulaic decision making, but I'd rather play the actual board game if I wanted that (especially if the chat doesn't function properly).",1557768864,1557768864,False,1,0,0.50299912691116333,0,True,False,False

Good.  Keeps track of the fiddly bits for you.  Which is wonderful for the more distracted types like me.

Bad.  The turn timer.  When you create an online game you choose a time.  A player only has that much time cumulatively over all their turns.  If you run out of time you are removed from the game and your place is taken by an AI.  In a two person game there's a possibility of simply being booted out of a game that you're going to win if you don't finish it quickly enough.  On the flip side if you leave it can ruin the game for others because the AI makes decisions that are pretty odd.

Further its not really clear when precisely an AI takes over in the even of a disconnection.  Today in the name of science (and masochism) I found out.

on the second generation of a three player game this evening a player disconnected or left during card selection.  They drafted cards but didn't buy any.  After about twenty minutes it became clear the player was no longer there.  The second player (who had far more sense than me left) one hour later the players time became blank, which indicated an AI had taken over.  But the game didn't recommence.  twenty more minutes after that the second player was taken over by an AI.

Then the order of play cycled back to the first player who had left only for a timer to display that counted down to zero.  Then the AI actually took action.

TL'DR I spent two hours plus playing TFM today by not playing TFM.  I'm not sure I'll ever want to play online again unless its my friends.  If you have friends you want to play this game with its great.

Now let me tell you why.  -I have maybe 2-3 HUNDRED games of the board game under my belt.  with/without all expansions.  I. Play. This. Game.  So when I heard that they created a virtual board top, I was very interested.

The reason we play board games is to enjoy the social aspect of the game.  The user interface of this game PREVENTS THAT COMPLETELY!  The chat is the worst I have ever seen of any game ever.  They might as well not have one.  It actually DETRACTS from the game.  (You have to basically close the game to see the chat...)

The user interface is terrible.  there's no 'back' for the phases, so if you accidentally hit 'sell patents'.  YOU MUST SELL A CARD.  stupid, stupid, stupid.   The number of times I've needed to build a city and a greenery in the same turn, but couldn't because I didn't get the order right, is way too many.  Games are supposed to be fun, not teachers of planning discipline...

You cannot see what the other players did that phase.  ONLY as they play it.  so if you blink, you missed it.  -Which means you may have NO IDEA who's attacking your production...

When others are taking their turn, you MUST watch then, you can't 'plan your turn' leading to OMG LONG ASS TURNS!

Play cards, accrue resources, terraform mars, win games.

I'll start by saying I love this game. The board game is great, the steam game could be great, but is still fun to play in spite of all the little annoyances that get in the way.

Pros:
- great AI opponents, the game has 3 levels, all of which I've lost to
- has ability to play online, but I haven't tried it yet
- fun game despite all the annoying quirks

Cons
- The graphics. They aren't great and they aren't necessary. The game can't seem to produce them without struggling, and glitching through it. The rest of my computer will be running smoothly, the game will be barely creeping along, frequently pausing and becoming unresponsive
- The price tag. It's hard to imagine a reason they'd charge so much for a board game when titles like Pandemic and Ticket to Ride are under $10 on mobile platforms. But whatever the case, they seem to have tried to compensate by loading it up with useless graphics.
- Confirmations. Practically everything you do requires you to click ""OK"" in a pop-up, and there's no way around it.
- Animations. They animate some things, but it's super useless and gets in the way more than it adds to the experience, and again, no way to turn it off.
- Expansions. There are none.

Finally we are getting somewhere. By now, the game is in a state where it is, at least technically, playable. I have not encountered any bugs for some time now and was able to finish all of my play throughs vs. AI.

At present i would still not recommend the game for the following reasons:

1. The AI plays very poorly. There certainly were some improvements with regard to city placing but the AI really lacks VP optimization and an understanding on which card to draft at which point of the game. There are some cards that are so good, that they should almost always be chosen. As a result: Games vs. AI work, but are not really fun since the player will almost every time win.

2. The PvP is still not very good. I admit, this is a hard one. Converting a board game into a multiplayer online game is very difficult. However the way it currently works is, you may start a game with a given timer for each player. Since the game punishes you (karma loss) for forfeiting a game, people just go afk. Which means you can either wait for an hour or 2 until you can continue your game or forfeit the game (which costs you karma). That way i lowered my karma level to 1 by now. The solution is simple:
a: Allow really long timer (10 days, 20 days, 30 days)
b: Allow starting of multiple games at the same time
c: Sent notifications to the player when their turn is up.

3. The game is still really slow. All the animations take really, really long and are quite unnecessary.

That being said: I still think they are making progress and i will continue to ocassionally play a game or 2 just to see, how the game is progressing.

[Update 28.11.2018]

I now have played for several months and i am giving up on the game. Games versus AI are pointless. Not only is the AI still ridiculously bad at the game, in many games the AI gets stuck when purchasing new projects, effectively ending the game. So far, no bug fix.

So the only interesting thing are games versus other players. But at present 90-100% of the games desync after disconnect at some point. So that part is basicly unplayable as well. 

The worst part: Literally no comments or fixes from the developers for more than a month now. No hot fixes, not even a comment aknowledging the problem.

I have to say: The game is a scam.

[old review]

Lets start with:

I LOVE terraforming mars. I have played an endless number of games with friends and colleagues i own all the extensions, so am a fanboy and i consider myself a very good player.

Now. The computer-version of the game feels clunky. The interface is needlessly large yet contains little information of what is going on. Everything is hidden behing layers of menus - and its really not all that beatiful. I looks a lot as if it was made for people with poor eye sight. Too much icons, too little text. Which makes the game extremely slow playing.

Also: The AI is abysmal (only tried hard AI).

It kept on building greenerys, creating perfect places for cities (which i promptly build of course) and even keeps on building greeneries, which will give ME additional VP at the end of the game. They kept on building cards, which were pointless at the time (it is a bad idea to buy and play a card, which gives you 1 VP for every 4 bacteria in the pre last round of the game!!!). The AI never actually played for the special bonuses on the temperature/oxygen tracks. And so on.

Right now i am deeply disappointed.",1539785286,1554038060,False,147,2,0.83551865816116333,10,True,False,False

I have old eyes :)  So I will not share my thoughts on the visual aspect of the game.  I am also putting this as a would not recommend because of my disposition towards the board game in general.  I would only feel comfortable recommending it if the bugs were fixed.   

First of all, Terraforming Mars is one of the best designed board games of all time and the application is a good overall representation of the board game.  

Overall, I really enjoy the game and would purchase again, but only because of how much i enjoy being able to play the game solo (the board game has a solo mode but it is vastly different from a multiplayer experience).  The problem with this application is that it is far from perfect.  Unfortunately, there are several blemishes to this game.  

The major issue I have encountered is the bugs with action (blue) cards.  I have had many instances where the action was grayed out (disabled) when I hadn't even used it yet.  This has happened with a few different cards, so I am not sure if it is a problem with a specific card or more likely with the actions portion of the program in general.  This is a large annoyance when you have spent a lot of resources to get a card like the one that transforms energy to credits (currency) only to find out you can't use it.  I have played multiple games and only experienced one crash so that hasn't been a deal breaker for me.

Another issue is that there are moments in the game where you would like to access certain information before making a decision and the interface won't allow it.   This is one area where the app differs greatly from the board game.  

The last concern I have is that the AI, even on the hardest level, isn't very difficult.  There is a caveat to this.  I have played this game numerous times (counting the board game as well), so I am a very experienced player.  I did notice that if you select multiple AI players it is a little better.

-No expansions, so the game is VERY basic right now. Always the same milestones and awards. This means certain builds are optimal and luck plays a big part in getting the cards for many builds
-Lots of bugs that leave games unfinished, penalizing you for needing to leave the game (the Karma system)
-Game breaking bugs... sometimes on the last turn, so you do not get to claim your victory!!
-Terrible in game chat/social features. After the game, you have about 20 seconds to chat before you are no longer allowed to. Chat menu bugs a lot as well, so people do not see what others are writing.
-Bad UI... feels like a lot of wasted space. Feels unpolished and rushed. 
-No draft mode. Be ready for full RNG games no matter how well you play. 

Will be seriously disappointed if they do not provide the expansions for free or at a seriously cheap price. 

Overall, the devs need to understand they have put out a very sloppy, cheap, and unpolished product. The game breaking bugs should be fixed ASAP, but have been there for months.

The game plays buttery smooth for me. I love that the main screen actually mimics the board version with Mars taking up most of the view and your tableau sitting below and in front of you. The tableau is very easy to read at a glance once you learn the game. The tutorial isn’t bad, but as a new player I could see how a bit of hand holding during a real game would be helpful. The good news is that the UI does show you what cards in hand are currently playable and it even accounts for special resources you have in your pool to help you play those cards. I appreciate that cards in hand are initially shown in a grid pattern with symbols showing what they do to quickly see what you have while clicking a card expands the card to see the details. I also like how when you bring up a card to play it, the UI highlights what resources are going to be impacted by that card (e.g. red=loss of resource/production). In general I’m pretty happy with the UI and how it works.

Thanks to the latest beta patch, I played a draft game and it felt very much like the board version. I like how the UI for drafting continues to show you what you have already kept making your next choices easier to make.

I did not encounter any bugs that I was aware of with the AI nor game mechanics.

What I found most surprising was that a game with 3 players (me and two AI) doing a draft took about 2.5 hours to play (I won by a slim margin) and a solo game took about 2 hours (I lost by 1 plant!). These times are about what I would expect with humans, not a digital version. I keep playing to see if this is a consequence of the wonderful animations built into the game or me just thinking too hard.

About the only ‘wish it had’ suggestion I can offer up is that an undo button would be great.

Overall, I truly have enjoyed my time with the game in it’s current state. I’ve been wanting Terraforming Mars for a long time but don’t have interested friends and time to play a full blown game in the real world; this scratches the itch so much and am thrilled a digital version exists.

I've not played it against online opponents, but in terms of the AI experience then it's slightly hard to recommend if you're a fan of the board game unless you're into the experience of putting together a strategy as a corporation and playing it through. I say this because the AI, even on Hard, is almost trivially easy to beat, example: it spends its precious initial cash building a first turn Greenery, which gives it a paltry one additional MC income for the rest of the game. If you're not familiar with the game then I can tell you that this is not the way to build a robust production engine in Terraforming Mars. It's literally the opposite. As a result, I win games about 95% of the time (I was scandalised by the one game I lost!) However, I [i]am[/i] the kind of player that likes playing around with the strategy design aspect of playing Terraforming Mars, so the game acts as a wonderful sandbox for me to play around in and for that I'm recommending it.

Otherwise this port is taking a lot of review hammering over bugs, but to be totally honest I've only encountered one or two game lock up bugs in my 40+ hours of play, neither of which I've ever had repeat on me (though I did have to forfeit the affected games). The only bug I've found otherwise is the extra actions menu got confused on me in one game, so I wasn't able to select certain actions for no apparent reason - I still won because the Hard AI, as noted, is terrible. If I had to pick one quibble then I'd say that the UI is a little clunky to use in places and sometimes you have to click several times to inspect various bits and bobs while making decisions - also, some of the special tiles can be a bit misleading in appearance on the map (most notably the Industrial District and Capital), which can be confusing as knowing what is and isn't a city is quite important.

The developers have stated they are working to improve the Hard AI, but the game is honestly quite complex, so I'm not expecting them to produce a stellar AI opponent anytime soon. Furthermore, this version is just the base game at the moment, I'm hoping they'll be releasing some of the expansions once they've ironed out the base game kinks.",1549496285,1549496586,True,3,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I signed up for the beta and the initial excitement of playing TM online made me blind to the faults of the UI.  But now having played 30 hours or so both against online opponents (when the game doesn't bug out) and AI, I can say without reservation, the UI sucks!  There is so much wrong with it, where to begin.
1. It is obviously designed for a tablet and looks like a poor port to PC - the graphics are unnecessarily big and clunky so you have to click through to get info on cards.
2. Getting info on your opponent's engine which would be simple in rl game requires several click throughs on each opponaent.
3. Playing resources on blue cards is unnecessarily tedious with up to 6 mouse clicks required.
4. Selling cards, again so many mouse clicks!
5. Cannot see map when buying cards in research phase
Edit: This has been rectified in the December beta patch
6. No undo once you've started an action
7. No indication who has bought milestones awards without clicking through
Edit: Milestone and awards UI has been improved in December beta patch
8. No indication that you have blue card actions available (I assume this is a design decision but the UI makes it a poor one)
9. No indication what cards paying out on tags are worth
Edit
10. The online play timer is clunky and poorly displayed
11. I have not had one online game yet where I have not been disconnected from the server, usually multiple times (thanks to my opponants for their patience btw). At times it feels like Asamodee are running the game on an abacus!

Generally all of the important info in game is buried under various layers requiring several click-throughs to access and it quickly becomes tedious to do this and is sucking all of my enjoyment of this game.

Additionally the multiplayer is clunky and laggy and at present there is at least one gamebreaking bug (mining guild) that I'm surprised has not been hot fixed yet,

Edit
The Mining Guild bug is reported as fixed now although I haven't tested myself yet

I would wait to see if there is a complete rewrite of the UI in the next update before I could recommend this.

Edit: As can be seen from my playing hours, I have played a lot more of this game since I originally wrote this review. The reason for this is that I am lucky enough to have 3 friends that I play online with that I can communicate to independently of the game so that when it crashes or desyncs we can all try to get the game back on track (sometimes this has taken 15-20 mins!) Without this, I would have given up on this game a long time ago.  Sure, the solo game can be a challenge but I can do that with the cardboard version.  Playing against the AI quickly becomes boring because even at Hard level it is laughably poor at playing so as far as I'm concerned the only reason to play this is against online opponents.  My roadmap for getting this game to where I could recommend it would be.

1. Squash the card bugs and scoring bugs so that a proper game can be played between online players (e,g, optimal aerobraking (new bug introduced with latest update - thanks!), flooding etc.  I genuinely do not understand why this is not simple to do (unless the devs don't (know how to) play the game or their code is so poorly written as to not allow simple changes).

2. Sort out the desyncs and crashes in the online game so that I can reliably play a game with strangers with no issues as opposed to just very patient friends.

3. Sort out the online timer issues so that timers are stopped during animations and other points where players have no control and also clearly display time left for all players.

After this the UI needs massive work with countless QoL improvements possible and then they could teach the AI how to play the game properly but right now I would be happy with the above 3 initially.",1540508370,1548606019,False,21,0,0.6714974045753479,0,True,False,False

It does have some issues still in JAN 2019:
The search for life card does not always work correctly and sometimes the card you discard ends up in your hand...
The blue action cards which consume say power, or whatever do not always work properly.  If you have more than one of these cards, the game generally only lets you use one of them each generation, which is wrong.  The game also sometimes just doesn't allow their use at all after a while, for no clear reason.  This can obviously be a big deal if you spent all early game getting that 6power>2pts card set up, and then it breaks after the first use and doesn't work in subsequent generations.  Lot sof issues likethat with a variety of action cards, mostly related to energy.

Also some minor bugs with actions being lost, but this is very rare.

Finally game hangs when placing phobos and ganymede cards, possibly due to fancier graphics.  This is a  decent computer, this shouldn't be happening, sometimes it hangs for quite a while.  Hasn't crashed yet, but something is sloppy in the coding or whatever.

QOL issues.  Given how often hotseat is likely to be a game mode for boardgamers (playing with family or whatever), some ability to turn off the turn summary duplications of each turn would be lovely.  Would cut the play time by 30%.  While the summaries are nice if everyone is not watching every turn, if everyone is they are just a waste, at the very least they should be cancelable.  Speaking of cancelation, the game badly needs an undo button, and a way for reviewing your hand mid turn when you are taking some other action.   Honestly with a board game like this, the game should really have a ""state clicker"" where you can fast forward or rewind to any previous game state.

A final QoL issue is the ability to take more than 2 actions in a row if everyone has already passed.

If these bugs are not going to be cleaned up, the game could also use some sort of console to make manual adjustments while playing to manually correct these issues.

Otherwise a solid adaptation, I hope it gets a final polish patch at some point, as right now it is on the border of unplayable unless you can be mellow about a few hiccups (which is not common in baordgamers).",1547618116,1547618300,True,12,1,0.626110970973968506,0,True,False,False

The interface is confusing, to say the least. Instead of focusing on tiny little 3d models for every little structure on mars (which do nothing for play experience, apart from slowing your pc down a lot), why not try to properly implement game mechanics first? In just my 2nd game, I ran into a game-changing bug that cost me at least 8 victory points - which can be more than what seperates 1st and last place in tight games of Terraforming Mars.

Also, there is no draft mechanic, and just the base game without any expansions is included. No possibility to customize game rules (like, f.ex., getting more corporations to choose from or drafting your starting hand); not even the additional maps for Hellas and Elysium are included.

Per-player time limits for the entire game are just plain stupid for a game that can last 8, 10 or 14 generations, aka rounds; I am not a slow player but the interface made it nearly impossible to carry on playing for more than 12 or so generations without running out of time. Other than games like, f.ex., Twilight Struggle, wich are destined to end after a fixed amount of turns have passed and for which fixed time controls are ok, but for Terraforming Mars - definitely not.

If you want to play Terraforming Mars, stay away from this for now. Get a physical copy, and/or play it on Tabletop Simulator - the user-created mod there does not cost you anything (apart from the need to buy TTS) and is way superior to  this implementation. Sure, you have to carry out card actions yourself, but for this minor inconvenience you get custom draft rules, the original (and much clearer) layout and the chance to play all those new expansions up to colonies.

I am willing to give this a chance, because I really love the boardgame and I am hoping the developers are going to fix current issues. Some suggestions:

Optional simple graphics mode - just copy the layout of the boardgame, to improve performance.
Add a draft mechanic, including options like first-hand draft (just check the TTS mod for inspirations on what can be implemented).
Implement per-move time limits. 15 minutes banked, plus 2 minutes for your actual turn is a better choice for ensuring a speedy game.
And, of course, fix those damn bugs. In my game, it was the Predators <-> Livestock interaction that was broken; my bears could not eat any of those tasty cows despite my opponent not having played Protected Habitats.

Currently not recommended.

Edit:

After playing a couple of games, I came up with the estimation that about 2/3 of multiplayer games do work more or less (or with only minor inconveniences, like the need to logout and login again because the turn got stuck).

It appears I was incorrect: no more than 50% of multiplayer games work, using that definition. It's not just a couple of victory points; it is truly game-breaking. Players forced to skip entire generations, because some stupid bug in the game makes them pass on the very first action round. People dropping out of game for exceeding the time limit, when the available time was shown to be 10 minutes or more just a minute ago. Some weird stuff with cards, like duplicate security fleet. I triple-checked it that game, but there were definitely 2 different players who each had the card ""Security Fleet"" out and were accumulating fighters on their copy (cards in Terraforming Mars are supposed to be unique!). One of them was bot, by the way, maybe that had something to do with it?

The user interface is horribly designed and outdated. You have no overview on what you can do. 70% of the screen are just wasted black while information on cards, actions, etc. is not shown. Animations are pointless and slow, you need to click on each item (e.g. available actions) to see what you can do this turn and need to click to confirm each action. 
There isn't an Undo function. There is no hint which of your card based actions you have already done. Even worse, the interface is buggy, e.g. the heat production is hidden (seems it doesn't fit on the screen), so even if you gathered 8 heat, you cannot use the heat to improve temperature, because you cannot reach the interface button.  Furthermore, there is no expansion option to e.g. using the - essential - preludium.

Pressing Esc exits most dialogue boxes, but if the action log is up, instead it keeps a dark overlay on the whole game, making it unplayable until you exit and log back in again.

The boardgame ""Terraforming Mars"" is one of the best tabletop games of the past 5 years. This digital version does a good job of re-creating the boardgame. This is because Terraforming Mars is a boardgame particularly well suited for a digital version as it's a game you can actually play by yourself. I think it's worth owning the digital version even if you have the boardgame. With the set up and game mangment automated the games go a lot faster but there is no face to face interaction. The digital version is also an ideal way to learn how to play a fairly complicated boardgame. This alone makes it worth it to me. 

They added a lot of animation to the game board that makes it visually appealing, which is nice because you spend a lot of time looking at the game board and your cards. 

The AI is surprisingly good. On the highest difficulty setting they could be mistaken for people. Which is about as good as it gets. There is local hot seat which is my favorite way to play, single player mode with AI, single player mode solo, and online play. I've only played local hot seat and single player with AI and they both work very well.

However, the UX design is unforgivably bad. Here are the three biggies:
- Its so very difficult to see the info you want at the times you want. Given that interactions between cards or knowing the exact situation of your opponents is essential to the playing the game, there is no reason that I should be forced to make choices without being able to quickly and easily know the game situation. Instead, the arguably least important view (the board) is the only part easily viewed (and not even that all the time). 
- It ridiculously difficult to know when you have been targetted for a bad event. At the very least you should get some modal which lets you know. 
- The worst of all is that you can't choose to view the info of another player during another players turn without getting it context switching you after a card is played (usually without it being evident that has happened). So, there is no good way to plan your next turn while others are playing.

Terraforming Mars is an amazing board game, this port is not in its current state.  There are bugs so basic that are not fixed making it unplayable.  When playing online you will be randomly kicked from game servers, and cant rejoin.  This happened to me after 2 hours of play and before scoring.  Its beyond frustrating. I have requested a refund and will rebuy it if I hear its fixed.  

Another important thing to understand is its made for phones and tablets, small screens basically so the entire UI is shitty because they were lazy and wanted a quick port to other devices.  As a result a ton of information is hidden behind multiple clicks because it wont fit on phones/tables.  Its beyond clunky.  Too bad because the game is imeensley fun in its board game form.  Check forums and see if it is fixed before buying it. If this review is up it probally isnt.


Update:  Steam would not refund me because I had just over 2 hours (the time to play 1 game)  I have played again.  This time no game breaking bugs or crashes.  I still can not recomend the game in its current state.  They claim they will have drafting in early December.    The UI is so bad its mind boggling.  Again they did nothing to utilize the fact we are playing on PC, everything is dumbed down as if you are playing on a tablet with very limited screen size.  The game log which shows you what people have done also, somehow is 90% cut off so you cant read ANY OF IT.  Its amazing how poor a job they have done.  I dont expect them to fix it as porting it to mobile and racking in more money while investing as little as possiable is there main goal.  I would also think there will be massive sales come winter sale when draft is in and its actually competitive.  

If you absolutley love Terraforming Mars and just need a fix, this game has it.  You can get a game in, in about 2 hours if people dont putz around which is much shorter then TM usually takes.  You will be frustrated though.

EDIT(11/7/2018): The game almost seems worse off now.  There are sync errors (yes in a turn based game) causing big problems.  They have removed some bugs, took them a long time.  But more seem to pop up.  I don't think this iteration of this game will ever be worth it.  Its so far from what it should and could have been.  There wont be much of a community left when it does.  Wait for humble bundle to sell it for 1$

EDIT(11/15/2018):  It keeps getting better.  It appears you can use a very popular and easy (free) CHEAT ENGINE to cheat at this game.  Basically stuff is handled client side (you).  In this game every card is unique, so it will only be played once (sans discarded cards being reshuffled if you make it through all of them)  But with a simple simple cheat program you can trick the game into to playing any card you want as many times as you want.

I have played a few games and would like to make a few suggestions to enhance the experience:

- Auto confirm the other players turns. It is a bit annoying clicking enter each time.
- Occasionally I plan my move during other player turns and am looking at my cards but the UI overides with thier turn. This is a bit distracting.
- Remove basic cards from selection for non beginner games - this is a bit unfair it someone selects this.

The bugs that people have been reporting haven't been happening to me, although I had some freezes but I was able to exit the game and restart where I left off.  I don't have much in the way of talking about issues with the programming bugs. 

While I do recommend the game it is not without its design flaws. 

First off, I am not a regular pc gamer so I can't pretend to have the level of expectation that regular PC gamers have with their games. I am an avid tabletop gamer though.  I have played the tabletop version of this game well over 50 times.  I can say that I like the UI of this version for the most part.  There are a few design exceptions however. 
The first exception, is whenever you are placing a tile on the map, you can't simultaneously look at your cards. This is a problem because it obviously limits information during the game when you need it.  
The second exception, is whenever you are buying cards you no longer have access to the milestones or awards (what they are or who has paid for them). This is sometimes an important part of why you might buy a card.    Also, you no longer have access to what tags other players have which might be important too for the same reason.  In the tabletop game you have every right to this information when you are buying cards.
The third exception, is no drafting.  While I am not as frustrated about this as others in this forum, it is obviously a thing they need to put in the game since it is a staple of our tabletop games.  

Having said the above, the above design flaws haven't made me not want to play the game.  I still find the game enjoyable and it gets rid of my least favorite part of the tabletop game which is the bookkeeping and has all the relevant information in places and links it's easy to get to. 
 
I will say that the price is pretty steep for right now, especially with the design flaws, however if they fix the above, and add some new board and expansions, it will definitely be more appealing.  
It's hard to be so binary with the Thumb up or THumb down as a recommendation.  While I did put a thumb up, I would mainly recommend this to people who just want to play quicker games of TM, enjoy the puzzle of the game, don't care about the current price too much and aren't that picky about the above design flaws.   I am seemingly one of those people.

1. The UI isn't half as bad as some of the reviews here might suggest. Having said that, it does feel like a tablet port. The least the designers could do is have the full text appear on the card when we inspect it, rather than have us show the whole text by an unnecessary 2nd click.

2. There's still bugs with several cards. Asmodee should really focus on testing and quality assurance, as their otehr releases (Twilight Struggle for example) also suffer from unfixed bugs. 
Moreover the AI tends to freeze during its move, effectively freezing the game. This is a very serious issue as of now (late Oct.2018)

Take in account that: 
a) I've played the actual boardgame *a lot* and love it and it twists the view on this a bit!
b) I've not yet played too much and because of how the online game system is done I have been able to *complete* only 1 game with strangers online (but have done more locally and in private games.) -> more about that below.

The bad:
1. The skip / turns has no meaning as the opponent can do infinite actions.
2. Removing Resource production is shown in the UI as removing resources, which makes it quite disorienting as you are not sure if you did something different. 
3. When playing a card where you can pick cards you can't check your own deck in the meanwhile (like you can in Research-phase.)
4. Asking for confirmation of if you want to sell cards after you have picked to sell cards is unnecessary because the UI for selling cards is select + confirm-ui so the card selling UI could just be Select + confirm + cancel and it would remove unnecessary step (which was really disorienting for a while, as you didn't expect it.)
5. You can't see which Awards gave you which points in the end of the game.
6. When player plays a card where they should reveal cards the game does not show to other players the revealed cards. e.g. with Search for life you can't really know when someone completes it
7. There is no overview of other players to get the whole picture of the game, you are required to browse through several submenus to find out things from other players.
8. Online games with strangers are sometimes stuck without a timelimit. So far 50% of my experience has been games where I got to do one turn and then other player just stopped playing and I waited for half an hour and nothing happened. (Just a note that this also killed Catan Mobile for me as ab. 90% of the games just got stuck with one player that decided to not to play. Probably the AI substitution should be also then default?)
9. Highlighting current status for being able to complete projects while browsing your cards while others are playing would be welcome, now it is highlighted only on your own turn.
10. Removal of resources or resource production sometimes seems to default to yourself in the removal UI. I have not yet seen anyone reducing their own production or resources in this game and can't see why they would do it (those SHOULD be optional to perform by the rules. Currently e.g. with Asteroid Mining Consortium at least it seemed that it can't be cancelled and if you are the only one with titanium production, you are required to reduce it from yourself. In the original game red-bordered reduction effects were optional.)
11. No confirmation on building of tiles
12. Have to pick tiles for building when playing a card where there is specified place on board where it should be placed (Phobos Space Haven, Ganymede Colony, Noctis city) and in the case of Ganymede, it's really small to point at and by default changes place at the same time as you move pointer so you have to chase it.
13. Currently you can NOT build cards that have global requirements that are maxed out. The rules of Terraforming Mars say: ""You may play a card that...
- raises global parameters that have already reached
their goal (for example when there are no more ocean tiles, or
when the temperature is at +8 °C)"" BUT in this game I'm not able to e.g. play a card that has an effect of placing an ocean tile when all of them are placed. This greatly changes the game again.

The good:
1. Automates resource collection, no forgetting of collection.

1. No draft version: While the draft version of the game is a cornerstone to more advanced players, and is a significant change over the base game for a multitude of reasons, I can't necessarily fault the developers in the game for not including an optional gameplay variant. I COULD fault them, however, if they included the variant, and it were broken. This would be, for example, like faulting a chess game that didn't include the variant where a pawn could upgrade to a queen after reaching the opposite end of the board - is it a valuable and interesting variation of the game? Yes. Is it a vital core mechanic? No. I would love to see the draft version added, as would many others who have reviewed this game, but I only fear that it will be hidden behind a DLC paywall.

2. Ugly UI. Pretty or not, the UI poses a number of issues, already mentioned, but I'll spare the repeat. The biggest single issue I have come across regarding the UI is the fact that you cannot freely access information regardless of which window is open. What do I mean by this? Say you used an action to draw a card, Cartel, which raises your money production by 1 for every earth tag you have. In the tabletop version, before deciding to buy, it only makes sense to look down at the cards you've played and count how many earth tags you have, before spending money (I.E. assessing the card's personal value to you). Unfortunately in the digital version, this is not possible, you have to decide then and there whether or not you want cartel, as you cannot open up your 'tags' menu while the buy menu for the card is open. This is the very scenario I encountered in my playthrough, and it frustrated me to no end to have purchased the card despite only having 1 tag - I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THAT BEFOREHAND.

3. Bugs on launch! Namely, there are bugs regarding some of the actions available in the game. The most noteworthy bug I found was with the predators card - while I was able to buy and play the card fine, I was completely unable to use the action despite the fact that the other participants did, in fact, have animal cards to eat from, leaving me with a very expensive, and useless endgame card, which should have earned me 3 points, as well as denying an opponent 3 points, yet still failed to function properly - changing a win to a loss purely through a broken card. The second issue I discovered was regarding draw cards - there are two blue action cards in the game which allow you to 'draw the top card, look at it, and decide whether to buy it, or discard it'. Normally in the tabletop version you can still utilize this action if you don't have the money necessary to buy the card - you simply have to discard it instead of being able to buy it. While this wouldn't benefit you necessarily, it would deny potentially valuable cards to your rivals. In this game, the action remains undoable - I would not be surprised to find more instances of actions being locked out due to money issues despite still serving potential gameplay value.

Overall, go get yourself the tabletop version. It might not be as convenient as playing online, but it will be a far more entertaining, and less frustrating experience.

Edit:  TL/DR version = If you already know and love Terraforming Mars, do NOT
buy this game!  You will find it deeply disappointing.  And by the time you discover
how broken it is, you will no longer qualify for a refund.
**********************************************************************************************

Adding my voice to those disappointed with this product and considering a refund.

For a long-awaited PC port, the design choices are just awful:

-> Actions take way too long - animations drag out simple actions, screens take too long to shift in and out, closing pop ups is sluggish.

-> When animations DON'T drag I can't register what's happening. Who lost a microbe? Why did someone get 2CR? 

-> It's impossible to get information when I need it. Tags should be visible in a table. Effects that impact other players should be clearly indicated with icons. Awards and Milestones should show how players are ranked/qualified.

-> When I draw or select a card, I should get all the info I need right there. Is it permanently unplayable? Show me! If I played it now, what would the immediate benefit be? If I draw ""Satellites"" I want to see right there ""You have 2 space tags in play - this card would increase your income by 3.""

-> Why aren't completed games stored? Stats amassed? I've got a whole damn PC here, let's USE it.

Dumb bugs:

People have probably called all these out, but most annoying are:

-> Mining Guild +1 Steel Production for ANY tile placed on Mars

-> AI's can take the ""Asteroid"" action for +1 TR when Temp has maxed out at 8.

-> Disappearing microbes.

-> Broken saves/suspended games.

Also: No PBEM mode? Really? Realtime net play only?

All these make the experience frustrating even without drafting or competent AI play or networking problems.

Then just now three of my friends and I were trying to do a four-player game; one could not join because he was getting an error message about needing to be online (which he was??? because you know he was chatting with us). The other three of us pressed ahead and then we kept having issues where it was my turn yet it was showing me that it was one of their turns (sometimes after the ""other player has taken their turn"" prompt, sometimes not). Initially quitting the game and rejoining fixed this but eventually rejoining the game was just indefinitely hanging.

So...yeah. Kind of hard to recommend the game when there's such fundamental fatal flaws like this that should have been caught before release. It's not like these are weird edge cases.

Biggest annoyance, is lack of visibility of opponent plays, your card not visible once you start to play it (to remember effects etc...), having to constantly click on more info to see a card, resources on cards.  And seriously consider game saves.

You can play it online or local with other human players, you can play against AI’s or you can play a solo challenge mode without any other players. You can also choose to allow all cards (corporate era rules) or to use an easier ruleset where you start with 1 production of every resource. 

The digital version has some room for improvement: I would like to see the option for manually changing resolution, a windowed mode and the popular draft rule for an added strategic element. The developer has said that they have seen the feedback and they promised to add at least the draft rule in the next free update.

In my opinion this game is already worth it because of the variety in game modes, rules and cards. There is a lot of replayability and that is without any of the expansions that exist for the boardgame version and without the draft rule. I think that it will only improve over time with the addition of the draft rule and the probable additions of expansions.

There's a lot of negative reviews for this game, some for justifiable reasons, others less so:
*Price - Compared to the $200 for the game, all expansions and promos, and quality of life upgrades, $25 for the digital version is totally worth it.

*Drafting - People are really fanatical about this. I don't understand why. I've never played with drafting, and don't really want to because the game is long enough already. I'd be willing to try it with people who I know are already familiar with the game but it's hardly THE essential feature people are making it out to be. Also it will be implemented in December which people reading the forums ahead of time could have figured out, so demanding refunds for a game you didn't research enough is...um...not justified.

*Weak AI - This is totally justified. The Weak AI is abysmal, the Hard AI is...not great. It makes bad decisions and even a moderately experienced player with a decent set of cards is likely to beat the stuffing out of it. -- Update: Having played a few more games against Medium and Hard AI opponents, they're not quite as bad as I though. They seem to be a little more risk-prone than I am when it comes to Awards, but they do just fine at picking milestones and taking advantage of plants to place cities.

*Bugs - This is also somewhat justified, there are a lot of bugs. Thankfully the devs seem to be engaged, and they've already released a patch after 48 hours. See below:
https://steamcommunity.com/games/800270/announcements/detail/168142486624181218

*UI Quirks - Some of this is just a need for people to learn the visual 'language' of this implementation, some of it is just not great.  There's already a fix for the resolution issues, but there needs to be better tracking of progress towards awards/milestones, and a better way to review your hand while your opponent plays (since you can't see what they did until the review phase anyway). Also, you need to be able to temporarily pause your research phase so you can look at the board/your tags/your opponents tags/etc as this can be really crucial to making decisions.

Some things where it improves over the base game aside from the obvious setup/maintenance/takedown inherent to digital versions of board games:
*Tags: This makes it SO easy to view your tags and your opponents tags and KNOW what they have.
*Effects: Same thing
*Actions: If you remember to review the actions, then list of actions you can do is very helpful. It could be better (a prompt that you still have actions you could take perhaps?) but it's pretty good now.
*The art is generally an improvement over the cardboard version and some of the effects (like the nuclear card) are just quite good.

All in all, this game is still absolutely playable (I've played at least 5-6 games already). The bugs are annoying, and perhaps this should have been designated an Early Release (I would still have bought it!) but I feel it's absolutely worth my $25 to be able to drop into a 3 player game against other people from the comfort of my couch.

It also works REALLY well with the Android SteamLink app both on an average sized phone and on a tablet. You just designate the phone/tablet as touch controller and use it to start up the game on your PC, then stream it from there. I haven't tried playing it on my hardware Steamlink because the Android steamlink experience is so good. The only issue there is it's difficult to use the text chat but that's more a phone as touch controller issue than a TFM issue.

A lot of people have complained that this port is clearly looking towards release on Android and IOS. Yes. It absolutely is. It absolutely should.

Phone/tablet gaming allows you to carry an entire game library in your pocket and reduces the opportunity cost of choosing to play a particular game immensely. It also has helped become the gateway for a number of people I know to enjoy certain games (Ticket to Ride, Sentinels, Small World) enough to be *willing* to try the cardboard versions because playing on a device that enforces the rules and guides your play is *easier*.

TLDR - Be aware of the flaws, but buy the game if you like the cardboard version. Or wait until December if drafting is absolutely key to your enjoyment but don't be butt-hurt that it wasn't included in the original release.",1539974952,1540091223,True,53,2,0.737384378910064697,0,True,False,False

I can either play hotseat (no thanks), or solo with AI. But I can't play with someone else that's not physically with me along with some AI players.

In multiplayer you can be sitting for 5-10 minutes sometimes for people to take their goes. A configurable turn timer per turn would be good.

I'm really disappointed to see so many early reviewers come down so hard on the first release of this game.  This is a really nice port of a really great boardgame.  There are a lot of players complaining about the lack of Draft mode, and the difficulty of the AI.  And I agree, both would be great improvements.  The first time playing the AI, I smoked them 147 TR to 74 on the nearest competitor.  It was a clear blowout halfway through the game.  But you know what?  I enjoyed playing Terraforming Mars through that whole game.  This is a very true digitization of the boardgame you probably love if you're reading this.

If you want Terraforming Mars portable in your laptop, this it it.  If you want to play with your gaming group split up accross the country.  This is that Terraforming Mars.  If you want to play online with some new people, because you're dying to play and you can't find a mate. This is that Terraforming Mars.  It does it's core job really well.

Draft mode would be great.  A Deep-Blue AI competitor that could smoke me nine games out ten.  Prelude.  Venus Next.  Alternate Maps.  Let's throw in the unrelease Colonies expansion while we're at it.  I want it all.

But it doesn't need to do any of those right now to be a quality product. And that's what this is.  And I trust Asmodee to keep working at it.

There are a few negatives but I consider them minor.  The most significant one is that the iconography used in the board game is slightly different than in this game.  I'm not sure why they made that choice, but it's easy to learn the new icons and full text descriptions are always available.  There also doesn't seem to be any game saving mechanic although it will remember your last local game and allow you to resume.

There should be enough PC desktop real estate to adequately display what is going on between the hand, the tableau, and the board, but the game UI just does not utilize any of it. You have to go through several drop down clicks just to see what cards are on your tableau, and a separate click through to activate any of them. Activation and description text on the cards are mostly hidden, requiring a separate click to read the text (not to mention the absent flavor text from the tabletop version) which is a waste because there is plenty of screen space on a display to show the entire card (or even multiple cards) To me, it feels like this version was strictly designed for mobile (with reduced screen space) and then ported to desktop. This makes for a very clunky play session for a game that is based on the efficient use and management of cards and resources.

0) No draft option

1) Interface
The interface is somewhere too big, somewhere to blurry, somewhere to complicated. The most annoying thing is a big amount of background animation (lines scrolling vertically and horizontally, especially when they cross each other). It really can make some people puke. Another interface thing that bothers me is that cards don't show full desc untill clicked * icon on it while the card itself has enough space to display all the text  without the need of * icon. Also, it's sometimes hard to distinquish is the building on the map is city or not (e.g. commercial zone. When you hover it nothing happens). Log is not really helpfull either - it doesn't show the details of Event cards people play (and most importantly whom they affected)

2) Graphics
While overall graphics is ok for board game adaptation, it has some major drawbacks. Apart from annoying scrolling lines everywhere, there are unnecessary blurs here and there which made me question my vision (or monitor) during the first launch. Another thing are the oceans - why they look like puddles (with kilometers-wide wave amplitude, lol)? Why they can't be hexes like forests and all other objects? They really differ heavily and even sometimes overlap with forests or other coastal structures (but not in a good way like in Civ 6)

3) Card bugs
Originally it's a board game and it was a big surprise to see any card-mechanics related bugs. The one that I found is with microbe-accumulating card. They just don't do it sometimes. The AI opponent I had was using the card's action every turn starting from the very 1st one and yet he ended with only 1 microbe on that card. Similar thing happened to me, but lasted only for 2-3 turns.

4) AI. Even the hardest AI is easy to beat because they just don't act smart. They plant forests they don't need, they don't place cities around their own forests when they have chance.

Hope the devs will hear the audience and apply some hotfixes here and there (especially fixing the bugs)
Overall the game is good for a board game adaptation but I'm not sure why buying it with that level of quality for now

P.S. BUGLIST:
- Search for Life - doesn't work after 1st success (after 1st microbe card you find)
- Predators card work/don't work from game to game (work 100% when opponent has it, doesn't work if I have, oh, irony)
- Tardigrades  - just stack from time to time
- No turn timer - if someone decides to dump you and go afk, game will wait for him till his timer runs of (global timer, which is either 1, 2 or 5h...get it?)

1. Blue card effects are totally hit or miss. The card that gives you -1mE when you play a card, straight up does not work. It took me a couple rounds to figure out why my math was always wrong and I was constantly 1mE short. It never applies the discount. 
2. It's a trivial thing to bitch about but clicking to read all the extra text is tiresome. Just put the text on the card in enlarged view by default.
3.  The log of cards played menu is partially obscured. There's a semi-transparent bar on the left of the screen that makes selecting previously played cards impossible.
4. Having the card you've just played/ currently completing (like increasing temp 2 steps or a similar multiple step card) would be a lot more helpful than tiny Phobos in the background.

A lot of the negative reviews come down to people being upset that the card drafting variant from the rule book is not included in the game. It's an oversight, to be sure, but that feature is coming in another month or two as a free update, so it's not worth being upset about, IMO.

I have no major gripes. The UI leaves a lot of empty space, which I feel could have been better utilised to have some information handy that is a couple of clicks too many to get at at the moment (failing that, a pop-upable status screen showing resources, VP's etc for all players on one pop-up screen would be really nice. Also, there's a lot of unnecessary graphical quirks (like the planet rotating just slightly as you move your mouse, and the hexes pulsing in waves etc) that don't do much except slow down the machine, so if you're playing on a Surface Pro (as I was) it's a bit laggy at times. You can turn off the planet rotation thing but not any of the other unnecessary ""touches"", so it would be nice to be able to turn those off.

All that said, the game is a LOT of fun and I think there will be a lot of replayability for me.

I'm a huge Terraforming Mars boardgame fan, so I'm quite familiar with the rules and gameplay.

But then I tried to remove his plant resource with my cards ability I couldn't be able to select him, and I have confirmed with my friend that he has a positive number of plant resource showing in his game and no other cards effect is preventing him from losing resources.

Then the second is that I have played a card and its effect allows me to pay $2 less for each card I play, but it never does for all the cards I played later.

I was trying to refund this buggy game but Steam rejected me because of the playtime exceeds 2 hours. However, in Terraforming Mars a game usually take more than 2 hours to play, and especially if you are not familiar with this terrible UI it's gonna take much longer.

When i played online yesterday my computer showed one of the other players greenery as two lower than it actually was, wich meant that when the player zeroed out greenery it showed as -2. We manually calculated the cards played and the ammount of greenery used was correct, so it just displayed wrong on my client. A huge problem if you cannot trust the displays to show the correct info.

Several cards clips the information text and there is no way to scroll or hover to see all of it.

When checking other players boards while a different player is playing is clunky and looses focus when the other player is done with their turn.

The chatbox is annoying as you cannot see the ""board"" or what is happening in play when it is up.

Its hard to get a good overview and to ckeck milesones/awards or other players cards requires a lot of clicks.

The user interface is not consistent, in some places you can click outside of a ""box"" to close it, in others you must use the x in the corner. You cannot open and close a window with the same button.

Much effort seems to have gone into animating the planet, a feature that is more an annoyance than anything else, at least there is a switch to turn it off. That time and money could have bern spent elswhere, like on the UI.

The grid is probably meant to look like a holographic overlay, but is too obtrusive. I would not have minded a way to turn it of for screenshots.

The main issue i have is rather simple: How do you fuck up at all a port of a game which is basically written as computer code already? How in gods name is a negative income of plants possible at all? 

The answer is: you don't. All the art existed already and you have minimalistic code you need to write. 

I am sorry but the effort that went into creating this is basically nonexistent. 

And all of this is just the single player. The real crux of it all is the multiplayer. The are no timeouts on mutliplayers, so any person cn block the game from continuing. I am sorry but this is just unacceptble. 

One last thing. The cards in the original tf:m were created so you can, just by looking at the symbols, deduce which effect they have. This is the part which made it so intuitive.  why the hell would you cut out the most important part of a card?
And why in the name of all that is holy do i not get a detailed spread of information when i hover on a card during selection? Jesus fucking christ.

You may want to buy it, IF you are new to Terraforming Mars and you don't mind frustrating UI bugs and a complete and utter failure by the devs to understand how online turn based board games are supposed to be designed.

With significant UI improvements, proper drafting mechanics and expansion content I would be willing to change my recommendation. As it is, it is in a sorry state but there is potential here.

I've played 0.99 games of it so far and it was a painful experience. The game bugged out and crashed?? we dunno. The chat was still working and we were all trying to figure out why the game was hanging on the final turn of the game after we had maxed out all the tracks and I had already done my final pass and the other two players were executing their final actions before end game scoring. We spent about 20 minutes trying to figure out why the game was hanging and then as a final resort tried to leave the session and rejoin, this caused the game to disappear like the last three hours+ had never happened.

The UI will freak out and bug out when you look at another player's tablaue and that player finishes their turn.

The devs obviously did not have a UI person on their team, it is terribly not intuitive.

1. The UI takes some getting used to and you will initially get confused a bit about who's tablaue you are looking at.

2. They only made enough space on the tablaue popup to see 8 ugly ass cards at a time. You have to use a scroll button to then page through tablaues 8 cards at a time.

3. There was a tremendous amount of wasted space showing space on your screen, I guess in an effort to make it look ""pretty.""

4. They moved around the icon placement and art for the tags were changed. Some are more recognizable than others, you will be relearning most of them.

5. The FRAKKING CITIES LOOK EXACTLY LIKE THE FACTORIES AND FINANCIAL DISTRICT, ETC.... it is very hard to tell apart cities from many of the special tiles. There is NO popup or detailed view of the game board. You are often left guessing/hoping that the forest you plopped down was next to something that wasn't someone else's city.

I do not know why, but they choose to use these really ugly faded static screen art versions of the cards. The art is not clearly visible and you have to stare HARD at the cards to pick out the shades of the artwork.

They wasted ALOT of screen space, it will make you wish they filled all that DAMNED SPACE SPACE WITH MORE SPACE FOR THE CARDS.

THERE IS NO DRAFTING OF CARDS, AT ALL. This is fine for a first time player but for ANYONE beyond the beginner game of Terraforming Mars this is a slap in the FRAKKING FACE. Did these devs even PLAY Terraforming Mars before? EVER??? Did they just read the nub rules and copied them over word for word?

There is NO TIME LIMIT ON PLAYER TURNS. Did these devs EVER play an online board game EVER BEFORE???? You put in options to include time limits on player turns like a chess clock or else the games might take a WEEK IRL TO FINISH BECAUSE THERE WAS NO PLAYER TURN TIME LIMITS PUT IN PLACE.

Where are the expansions?

The good things are.

They have BG muzak. Its OK. It looks nice and sparkly, sorta like giving Donald Trump the crown jewels of England. It has a solo mode and local play options for when your hanging out with your friends and you have no physical copy but you have a computer with access to steam, yaeeehhh!

- Tutotial is subpar at best. The transition between five sections are very abrupt. I didn't learn much after finishing the tutorial.
- Played few games. I found the ""beginner company"" ironically hardest one to play because I feel overwhelmed by the number of projects on my hand.
- The top reviewers are right about everything. Informations are usually hidden behind UI. I remember the last game when I draw projects. After reading a card I was wondering what does the board looks like right now and there is no option to minimizing the project screen. That was pretty frustrating. (I would like to compare this point with Twilight Struggle which get this done much better.)
- Seems like developer kind of taking the ""minimalistic"" approach with the UI as some reviewers mentioned. I have no problem with that as long as it is done nicely. I feel like details are oversimplified with the use of icons and such, which are really confusing for new players. For example, a project mentioned icon ""Jovian"". I had no idea what that is and hovering the mouse over cards icon shows nothing.
- Icons are surely overused. The worst part is they are pixelated. Yes, pixelated. Safe to say this has to be one of the worst icons I have seen in any game. The game looks unfinished.
- UI overall feels very clunky. It is not fast. It does not look good because you can feel it is unpolished. Check the corner of buttons. You will see the transaparent effect on top does not even matches the buttom shape.
- Overall this is such a bad design of the UI. To be fair, perhaps it is more about implementation rather than the original idea. Anyway, it is definitely not good. Another review describes it nicely that there are very little information on the screen.
- Personally, the worst thing about this digital version is that it fails to capture the appeal of the game. When I look at the physical game, the cards look ominous. I don't know how to describe this but they kinda radiate some kinda of aura and feel unique and very well made. Cards in this game look like some generic crap with badly made icons.

Reset ranked counters and prevent this from happening in the future. I understand that this issue stems from so few people using the game right now. BUT! this needs to be prevented some how.

-You should be able to minimize the menu in front of you and look at the map at all times. This seems very obvious as the map is a huge part of the strategy so to be blocked from viewing it properly while making a decision makes no sense.

Most glaringly, I don't know if the game adds up the victory points that I had for having fighter resources on one of my cards -- I just lost a game against the AI where I am almost certain the game didn't add the 10+ VP from that card to my total. The final tallying screen isn't as exciting/interesting as it could be, either. There needs to be a better presentation of the victory points tallying.

Anyway, I would also love to have prelude cards, and the option for drafting. There are a few interface tweaks that would be nice too. When I am purchasing a card that requires 8 science tags, I don't think the game gives me any way of checking how many science tags I've played (at least not on the purchasing screen.)

All in all the game runs smoothly and the AI seems to be making intelligent choices (at least on hard mode). So I'd definitely recommend to try it whether or not you know the board game version. I personally like the graphics too.

Finally, some critique points:

1. Collecting animals / microbes seems to be bugged sometimes. The resource does not get added.
2. Drafting is missing as a mechanism, which IMO is a reasonably important part of the board game, being the largest luck mitigation factor.
3. Having to click three times on a card to view the whole text is probably not necessary. The text would easily fit on the card in enlarged mode.
4. There is apparently no virtual ""discard pile"" within the program. A card I discarded in G1 got played by an AI in G2. I don't know whether this is intentional but this certainly would never happen in the base game so it's worth noting.

I have played the board game version of Terraforming Mars for over a year and I loved this game, purchased all the expansions released so far and enjoyed them all. I wasn't hoping the steam version to be  identical to the board game but this is way too worse.

1. No drafting. Drafting is a must for this game as near 80% of the decision making in this game is involed in the drafting phase, i.e. picking combos for yourself, blocking someone's key card etc. The excitement of seeing more cards and deicde which one is the best for you now or in the future is so high that it keeps me playing over and over. However, without drafting, the game is essentially just a boring solitaire about doing your own things in a correct order.(as you don't fk up yourself is alright) And the absence of drafting makes the game's result is largely decide on luck. If you pull off a great combo like Teractor + several Earth tag + Cartel and other player don't, the game is just basically over. And the worst part is , others have zero information on your cards and your upcoming strategy, there is no way they can block you or at least hinder your development. This makes the game extremely boring and lack of interaction. The drafting shouldn't be called a variant as in a game where every card is unique, drafting is the best and essential way to minimize the random factor. Drating is a must-have part in this game. I will not play Mars without drating as I think rolling some dice may be more fun, and need less time.

2. The UI is anti-human. Overall UI is pleasant to look at and clear on productions/amounts of resources, but other part is total garbage. The milestones and awards are unclear on showing who is winning, the card list is bulky and hard to find a card, the VP tracker is good but why not tracking the VP from Greeneries and cities also? Also, there are no undo button, for a at most 2 action turn, it is not hard to program a undo option. Moreover, after you comfirm playing of a card, like placing a tile or draw and examine a card, there is no way to look at others tableau or your own, you must finish the action first which is totally anti-human. The coloured border of the tiles to indicate the ownership is very unclear, why not just put a coloured cube in the center of the tiles like in the board game? 

3. Tons of bug. I have just played a single game against the AI and I already discovered several bugs. Predator can't eat others animals, search for life doesn't reveal the discarded cards, Olympics Conference doesn't work at all...etc. Those errors are inevitable in a game of so many unique cards but they need to be corrected as soon as possible.

For the above reasons, the game feels like a rushed incomplete product to me. I will not play it anymore before the above issues is concerned and I will not recommend it to anyone like playing the board game version.",1539794322,1539794624,False,99,2,0.793900787830352783,11,True,False,False
