Sims 3 is better than Sims 4.

Yes, I have tried playing Sims 4, while it does have a lot more fine tuning when it comes to the creation of Sims and Infrastructure, it's the absolute atrocity that is the UI and Menu's that kill it for me. I also spent about $150 (AUD) on Sims 4 DLC's only for none of them to load/work despite spending hours troubleshooting. Gave in and refunded the whole lot.

Sims 3 at least works for me - I like that I have a lot of control over the creation of my neighbourhood and the more simple UI and menu options. The game is outdated unfortunately, which means using the Online services is either very difficult or impossible, but there is enough there for me to have had plenty of fun... and getting jealous that my Sim/s are having much better lives than I am xD",1708917234,1708917234,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The reactions from sims, the dynamics between them make such greater sense. Yes - the graphics are considerably worse, it was made in 2007 after all, but its honestly made up for! Controversially i'm not a huge fan of open world but goodness do i not miss seeing the spinning plum bob loading screen everytime i want my sims to visit the beach or a restaurant. I do wish i was playing when it was in its prime so I could actually feel more confident purchasing packs for it since they're no longer getting updated. In conclusion, will i play the sims four more? Yes of course. But the sims three in terms of actual depth of game play gives it a real run for its money, arguably being a much better life simulator in general. Instead of buying another niche cash grab sims four gamepack actually buy TST. I can really tell there was so much more thought and effort into the little details.

The Sims 3 was one of my favorite games since the release in 2009, I was stoked, I was always into The Sims as a kid, still am. Owning The Sims 1, The Sims 2, and now The Sims 3, I can say the improvement is very noticeable. I'm here to type this review since I had this game for quite some time, I've been addicted to the game recently so I figured to do this now while I'm inspired to do so.

[h1]What is The Sims?[/h1]
If you aren't familiar with The Sims, this is a kind of game with a Life Simulation, sure, playing with virtual dolls in a way, but somehow it's very addicting and quite relaxing. The Sims has a unique playstyle for each individual person. Some like to be architectural and build houses to pass the time. Some want to have their own challenges in creating a family and see how far the generations will go. Some people just want to drown their Sim for enjoyment just for the hell of it. These are just examples of what you can do.

[u]The Concept[/u]
Every Sims game has a ""Needs"" bar, to bathing, Eating, Entertainment, Social, these are examples. You would simply replenish these bars by cooking, watching tv, etc.

Your Sims are basically humans, they live under a house. You can build your own home and can really unleash your architectural talent, or just practice in general with your imagination. Otherwise, you can simply move your Sim into a pre-made house if you wish to. Living in these homes you can add furniture to whatever you desire to fit the lifestyle of your Sim.

Your Sims have a personality you can give them, do you want them to be romantic? You can do that. Do you want them to live miserable and happy? You can also do that. In The Sims 3, you are given more to give to your Sims compared to the other games, however, the concept stays the same.

You can also edit and dress your Sims to fit their personality as well. Do you want to give them a Tatoo? You can do that. Give them a Cowboy hat? Of course, you can also do that. [i]I'm sure you get the idea...right?[/i]

[h1]EA Game, must be DLC Hell.[/h1]

It is, unfortunately. The Sims is known for their expansions, however, most are indeed worth it. The Sims 3 is fair of $20 in my opinion, however not for most expansions by how old this game is. The Sims 3 does go on sale often to $5 including each of the DLC's often, so I would snag them when they reduce to that price.

In my opinion, I would recommend these Expansions to start out with:

- The Sims University = Enroll your Sims into a University for better jobs.
- The Sims Pets = You can add Cats, Dogs, Horses into your family.
- The Sims Seasons = Add Weather and Holidays in your gameplay.
- The Sims Late Night = Able to use Apartments and enjoy the Night Life
- The Sims Generations = More things to do, extending the Family Tree.
- The Sims Supernatural = Able to have Vampires, Werewolfs, Witches, etc.

The rest of the Expansions are optional, I can recommend them, these are just some I think would work best for most people, however, having all these Expansions will add more to your gameplay. Again, these do go on sale for $5, they are an absolute deal if you get them at that price.

[h1]The Sims 3 or The Sims 4?[/h1]

This section is very opinionated, The Sims 4 is an improvement for sure as your Sims can actually multitask on what they do, especially during socializing. The Sims 3 lacks that of course, it's older. Graphically I like The Sims 3 more than The Sims 4 because the 'Cartoon Graphics' 4 has personally displeased me. The Sims 4 Expansions weren't as fulfilling as The Sims 3 had for new content. The Sims 3 has an Open World where The Sims 4 does not, which does include performance issues that The Sims 3 has for weaker end systems, even stronger ones, I suffer with it sometimes.

Overall, each one has its advantages and disadvantages and just varies on taste. The Sims 4 is only available on Origin, however, at some point, we may see it on Steam since EA has been more open with Steam recently with newer titles.

Edit: I should say now The Sims 4 is able to be purchased on steam as this review is very outdated.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

I hope I provided enough, for people just looking into The Sims or Veterans, I can recommend this, full price at least for the game, though, again, the game does go on sale for $5, same as its expansions.

Modding support is still alive, in fact, I'm using some right now such as Worlds and Clothing for certain Sims. These can be easily accessed from a few websites.

So in conclusion, yes get this game.

Yes I recommend this game... but I also don't recommend it until it gets cheaper, the cost of all the DLC right now is over 300 pound. Some of the DLCs break your game.
I have 4 mods to make the game lag less and be less buggy, it's still buggy and laggy, my computer is far superior to the requirements to run this game.
My paint slaves still have lag, in their tiny little underground cells with food, toilets, beds and easels for painting, and they all look suspiciously like Trump.

The game itself is very enjoyable, but the cost of the game and the amount of bugs that many people suffer from that go unanswered is quite heavy. There's a Sims 4, that isn't on steam. And this game still costs full price.

Update: The game runs AWFULLY on new computers... Just sputters along, barely manages, do not go windowed mode, do not turn graphics to max, like I did. My computer is more than capable of handling it, the game just doesn't want to run very well.",1508508286,1706085860,False,0,0,0.439679533243179321,0,True,False,False

The game has some serious bugs now and then that will make you want to cry. Look up how to install mods to solve the bugs before they happen. Also, the saving and loading can be excruciatingly slow if you don't have a good SSD.

However, this game has so much quirk and character! It feels very alive and has such a nostalgic quality. Its so cool to be playing as an adult with all the DLC i wanted as a kid. Dream come true. My only complaint is towards myself and its to stop putting my game in fast forward so often! I always want to get as much done as i can in one sitting, but when you speed up time you miss a lot and can make some mistakes.

Honestly, just save frequently and you'll be fine. In the end, its just the sims.

I'll always love this game, and I cant wait to see how many hours I rack up over time. 7 hours on the first day is easy squeezy. I'll probably play more after work tomorrow too! I usually play the sims 4, and I have over 1000 hours in that, but sims 3 has always been my dream since childhood. watching game-play on you tube, and running base game on my cruddy old laptop.

i have a LOT of experience with the sims 2, 3 and 4 and i can tell you now that 3 is by far my favourite, from the immense open world system to sims with unique and memorable personalities - this game is great and you can tell a lot of love went into making it. the only problems i have with this game however, are the glitches and lags. some of the glitches where sims morph or get weird facial expressions are funny and if anything it makes the game more entertaining. but there are a ton of lags and bugs that make the game frustrating to play over long periods of time, most of these consist of sims freezing in place or clipping and just a lot of freezes and lags in general. so if you have the time i definitely recommend installing a smooth patch (if lags bother you a lot, do NOT get island paradise DLC). but other than the lags this game was a very big part of my childhood, but the reason i still play it today is because of all that you can do. in contrast with the sims 4, you can WALK AROUND OUTSIDE, skill building is more fun, you can go collect random rocks and seeds from parks, if you have seasons or pets you can go to non-worm hole events and take part in competitions or bets with your sim. this game has so much to offer and if you're into goofy life-sims where you can actually get attached to your sims i definitely recommend playing this game.

That being said, the Sims 3 did some really cool things with the franchise. It was super ambitious for the time and is still impressive today. You have a crazy amount of control over so many tiny pixel lives. You can have two types of robot, a sparkly vampire, a rock star werewolf, a crazed mad scientist whose only job seems to be blowing things up, that old woman who told you get off her lawn but who is also a celebrity the likes of Tom Cruise in his prime, and several guinea pigs in the same house.  Not only that, but the entire house - the entire town - can be carefully arranged to look like an anime catgirl from above. And not only THAT, but you can make every single object, every single piece of clothing, every single thing your Sims ever touch have kickin' rad flames that make them go faster.

But it kind of fell flat on its face with optimization and actually implementing its great ideas.

The DLC's are necessary to have a great game (Sims 4 doesn't offer a great game even with DLC). 
Cottage living (Sims 4 DLC) was the only one that came close to Sims 3, I had it. (check it out 
 on Youtube)
Sims 4 doesn't even have a good city map. It looks like drawn on a cardboard. 
The graphics of Sims 3 are quite okay for me, I just max them out and tweak the settings file and it is alright.

 Sims 4 is arguably more smooth looking and the behavior of the sims, their emotions are what Sims 3 lacks. In spite of everything mentioned in this review, I can safely say, Sims 3 is way better and worth it. I played both",1703356859,1703357772,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Look, I'm recommending based on the sheer amount of fun and replayability this game has offered me. It was a buggy mess in its prime and it runs even worse on modern computers. You'll have to tinker with it to get everything working properly, and you should still save often for when it inevitably crashes. 

There are some great guides on here which compile mods that greatly improve the performance, if you have the time for that. If you don't, play the Sims 4. I've finally started embracing the Sims 4 for what it is after refusing to touch it for the past 9 years (yes, it's been that long since a new Sims game.) But I will say, 3 just has this charm and life that 4... doesn't. 

EA has always been a greedy piece of shit company, and the DLC is absolutely NOT worth it unless you catch it on sale, even though vanilla gameplay kinda sucks.

With the age its at mods are essential to run it.  Poke around the Sims3 subreddit for suggestions but also look into the framerate capping as well, allegedly it can wreck your hardware over time by running a needless amount of frames per second.  The game is a decade old now as of its last expansion.

I like it a lot but the amount of times I have to play bug correction, mod micromanaging and googling a setting because nraas is doing shit that doesn't jive with my playstyle, learning how to do backups etc eats up a lot of time.  I use regul save cleaner, a more outdated attempt at such a software hosed my save at one point so be careful.  If not for ""32bit game that didn't take 64bit into account with a 4GB hard cap limit"" it'd be perfect but its not.  I have the time to google and play bugfix, a person with an actual job and responsibilities would not imo.

also yeah buy it on steam and not via EA's store as allegedly that bricked some peoples' hardware and requires being online to play the decade+ old offline game.

The amount of fun you can get out of even the base game alone is pretty astounding. There's just so much for your Sims to do in each of the vast open neighbourhoods included. Throw a couple of DLC packs in there and the possibilities become near-endless. It really feels as though I've barely scratched the surface with my modest 113 hours. It's wonderful.

Like I said at the beginning though, getting things to run smoothly is a little bit of a hassle. Thankfully there are tons of helpful guides and fixes if you're willing to do a little digging. Rarely do you need to worry about anything else once those fixes are implemented too. The only other downside I can think of would be the prices of each DLC pack. While I believe a majority of them are worth the money, ten year old content should never remain full priced. Best wait for a sale on some of them. TS3 really is fantastic though and I'd recommend it to anyone who's in the mood for a really engaging, slightly chaotic life simulator.

I have been so bummed due to sims 3 not performing well years ago, but that was then and this is now. The game runs perfrectly!!!!

I'm so happy I can finally throw ""The sims 4"" in the garbage where it belongs, cuz sims 3 is now the only sims game I play.

Are you having issues with the game? I'm guessing lagging or possibly that the game wont even launch at all.

Well... Good news!!!!
Not only am I giving this game a review of 1000 out of 10, but I am also going to tell you how to make this game work like a dream:

1. Look up the channel named SimMattically on youtube.

2. Find a video currently titled ""How to Get Sims 3 and Make It Run | Recognizing GPU, Limiting FPS, Game Not Launching & Lag Fixes""

3. Follow this very simple and easy guide! It is so easy. If I can do it, then you can do it!

4. Not sure if he mentions this in the video seeing how I knew about this step before watching the video, but you need to figure out how many hertz your pc screen/monitor can handle. Mine is as 240, but I set my limit to 140. You need to set a limit as well. You might also have to do this in the ingame settings. (Again very easy) - lots of videos on youtube to help with this step, but for step 1 - 3 I suggest following Simmatically's guide (and he might mention this step as well). His guide was the one that worked for me, and the one that did not make me feel stressed out about what I needed to do.

Do me one favor. If you make this game work after following the guide, then give it a good review here on steam! Finally we can play a sims game that is actually fun and filled to the brim with content. And yes, The sims store still exists, so you can get even more content for the game than what is on steam! Big things like an amusement park and so on.
Should you do me this one favor, then please also give a shout out to Simmatically for telling us how to fix this game. This will help spread the word about how to play The sims 3 without any issues.

From the moment I embarked on my virtual journey, I was captivated by the sheer depth and richness that the base game offered. The meticulous attention to detail, from the Sims' emotions to the intricate world-building, laid the foundation for an unparalleled simulation experience.

Now, having indulged in every expansion, stuff pack, and expansion content available, my Sims 3 universe has transcended the boundaries of virtual reality. The myriad of customization options, thanks to the DLC, transforms the game into a reflection of my wildest imaginations. Whether I'm building dream homes, shaping the destinies of my Sims, or exploring the diverse neighborhoods introduced by the expansions, each gameplay session is a unique and immersive adventure.

The expansion packs, in particular, are not mere additions but gateways to new realms of gameplay. Whether I'm delving into the supernatural mysteries of the 'Supernatural' expansion or building a bustling metropolis with 'Late Night,' each expansion seamlessly integrates into the core experience, enhancing the game's depth and ensuring that boredom is a concept that simply doesn't exist in my Sims 3 world.

The longevity of my enjoyment is a testament to the enduring appeal of The Sims 3, and the DLC has played a pivotal role in keeping the experience fresh and exciting. As I continue to uncover hidden gems and unlock new features, I find myself immersed in a virtual world that has become a cherished part of my gaming journey.

For the base game, it's quite packed with features and activities that you can do since it's an open world game (I'm watching you The Sims 4 (* ￣︿￣)). But for a much complete experience of life simulation, you don't have to own all of the expansions/stuff packs. For me, I can easily recommend Seasons, Generations, and Pets expansion a buy for a complete experience, and rest of them are completely optional and it's up to your liking for buying the rest.

Despite that, The game's still not perfect, Being an open world game, it has an issue with performance, bugs and glitches, etc. though It can be fixed with some mods to make the gameplay experience much better.

From a Sims veteran to all you other vets and newcomers, this is the definitive Sims game. If you are a brand new Simmer or coming from 4, I recommend starting with just Sims 3 base game (there is PLENTY there to enjoy). If you are daring, you can buy Sims 3 with Seasons and Pets to flavor your game up. You need to make sure the game is right for you so obviously don't buy all DLC until you are sure you like it. 

I do warn you, though: if you have a very old machine then I don't recommend buying Sims 3. The open world and graphics while great make it lag like hell on older machines. Play at your own risk. There are guides out there that are dedicated to helping you make sure your Sims 3 runs as well as it can, but not all machines will like it. 

1. Your choices matter
How you create your Sim to the actions they take will affect the world around you (either very minimally or drastically) because there is an open world and your Sims personalities are very distinct. 

2. No micromanaging!
Sims 1 especially had this problem of micromanagement. No more queuing up three meals and five talk interactions; one meal satisfies your hunger (Mostly) and just one or two conversations makes your social go up. You might see this as a negative, but this actually gives you more time in the day to do things such as buying things or developing skills. Needs decay also a bit more slowly than they did in 1 and 2 so you aren't constantly keeping your needs green.

3. Careers are far better
You can also do things with your Sims while they are off at work or at school! You can adjust how they work or what they do (granted they are rabbit holes but it's better than nothing). You can meet your students/coworkers or develop skills WHILE working. It's also no longer ""You must have this required thing for a promotion"" as it's more like ""you must be in this range for a promotion"" so you can still progress. Things such as challenges and relationships also affect job progression. Getting level 5 in a certain skill will impress your boss, raise your pay, etc. 

4. Building is fantastic
You can place almost every object in whatever x-plane orientation you want if you hold down ALT (which means you can turn off the grids). You no longer have to tear down rooms and things to fix a house problem; you can just expand the room or use blueprint mode! There is also create-a-style, which basically lets you put whatever you want on anything. Wanna put leopard print on your fridge? Do it. Want to make your car out of bricks? Do it. You can adjust individual colors and even set your own shades with them! 

5. Open world
Sims 1 and 2 were closed world, which sadly made you a prisoner of your own home. Granted, Sims 1 is the first so I get it. Sims 2 could have easily done it. Sims 3 does and it does it so well... despite the optimization errors. Mostly no loading screens and I can see the world be alive! 

6. So much on offer
I remember back when I first bought Sims 3 base and played that for probably 100 hours minimum before I even bought an expansion (it wasn't through Steam). It can keep you hooked for a VERY long time. Even the day this review was edited, I had a six-hour session in 3 and had a blast throughout it. 

7. Progression takes time
In sims 3, it takes a VERY long time to pick yourself up off the ground from nothing. You need to hone all your skills, make connections, and save those pennies before you can start moving up. Sims 1 and 2 had this progression, but Sims 1 was also a constant clickfest due to the motives decaying so quickly and Sims 2 felt a bit too fast for me. Sims 3 hits it JUST right and oh so perfectly. 

8. It's so damn fun
The most important thing about a game is the fun factor: this game absolutely nails it. I have a blast playing all the time. 

Despite the obvious problem of the buggy open world, this game is an absolute gem. Like I said, I have played Sims 1 probably the most out of all these games with Sims 3 seriously catching up. Sims 3 is THE best Sims game.",1418742748,1700854375,True,1,1,0.502892255783081055,0,True,False,False

4th is too dumbed down and overmilked by the EA with countless minor add-ons that add up to thousands of dollars in price as you go through them.
Certainly, Sims 3 are also majorly milked by the EA with add-ons, but those are significantly fewer and each one has more content.
Even just the base game is good enough to play on its own, without any expansions.
Still an incredibly hostile behavior on EA's part to charge circa 500 USD for all expansions. I'm not going to buy them on the principle. Even if they go on sale.
Also launcher is terrible and will leave your play time meter on even after you close the main game.

What do I hate:
EA
Sims Store
Sims Store integration in the game loading screens
Sims 3 Launcher
Ridiculously overpriced expansions. Especially since it has been 14 years since game release.

Sims 3 the game

Easily the best iteration of the series due to the breadth of activities and content at your disposal, and having an active neighborhood where other sims age and grow at the same pace as your household.

The one caveat is that you need to install a few third party mods to get it to run on modern hardware, but setting everything up is not particularly time consuming:

Don't get me wrong, the sims 4 is my life and soul, but when it comes to gameplay there is a clear winner. The only thing missing from this game is the graphic quality. I know this game is a relatively old game so I can understand how the graphics are not going to be ultra 4k HD, but I'm just stating what the pros and cons of the game are. CAS is very customization as far as color wheels, patterns, and just overall color options as i said before. There aren't many clothing and hair options if you don't have sim points or install mods though. Build mode is great! Again, limited options, but you can make a decent build with it!

This has been my favorite game since I was 13. Sims 3 is the only open world game in the series, and the DLC gives you way more content for your money than Sims 4 does. (Still overpriced though lol) I have 2000+ hours and I'm not bored yet.

The two main issues with this game that you might want to consider before buying it:

1. It's buggy / unoptimized if you don't have the patience to install mods. The worst example of this is the lack of a framerate cap or vsync option, which causes it to run at 1000+ fps on some newer graphics cards if you don't get LazyDuchess's smooth patch mod. NRaas mods also help a lot with the bugs.

2. The character customization without mods is much less expansive than in The Sims 4.",1695221481,1695221628,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The amount of content (when DLC are considered) is truly astonishing and can leave people who have spent years playing in awe of how many things there are to discover. There are many cases where people posted online about a certain feature, object, mechanic of the game that they've just discovered in spite of playing for so long. 
But even without the DLC, this game is fairly content-filled as this is the only game with an open-world like gameplay which hits the jackpot. This adds so much to the atmosphere of a way a player perceives the town their characters live in. You get to see how it's changing, evolving, how families come and go, what legacy they leave behind (especially when you mod the game) and only the Sims 3 has ever done it.
Okay, indeed this implementation is not without its limits and problems. If you purchase many dlcs and launch the game, it is not optimized correctly and you pretty much need optimizing mods (which are thankfully easy to install and apply to the game) even if you own a very good PC this game WILL lag and cause you problems if you do not install mods.
If you can withstand this, you are in for a few thousand hours worth of content, the biggest potential in comparison to all Sims games (The sims 4 included) hands down. The graphics are okay, maybe not outstanding but good enough not to complain and they can be successfully enhanced by mods, too. Soundtrack is very sims like (who would have thought) but I'd argue it is the most fitting balance of a magical and optimistic vibe without sounding almost annoying like it sounds in the Sims 4.
And, what's imperative to mention, these were the times when EA still (somewhat) cared about their customers or at least showed them proper respect so the DLCs truly bring a lot of content that makes the game as the whole. It's not just a bunch of small add-ons posing to appear as something bigger than they really are.
If you are looking for a life simulator and you are thinking about the Sims 3- do not think twice, buying it (and managing its limitations and errors) will pay off.",1694643382,1694643382,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Firstly, yes, the graphics aren't exactly great (but they're still bearable) but I still believe the compromise is worth it. I like the fact that whenever you travel somewhere, it doesn't put you into a loading screen and instead you get to see your sim travel there - whether it be via a jog, run, taxi or a car that you have purchased - this of course is personal preference but I really don't see why it's a thing in the Sims 4. Another thing is the Pets DLC. In the Sims 4, for some bizarre reason, you have no control over the pets. However, in the Sims 3, you get to control the pets and interact with them as you would with any other sim in the game.

Let's go back to 2009, the beautiful late 00s. Gaming was PEAK at this point and fans had no reason to expect something revolutionary. The Sims 2 was considered nearly flawless, making the obvious followup one of the most hyped releases of the decade. What new adventures awaited in the next installment?

Well I didn't get to find out cuz as we all know Walmart laptops from 2007 were terrible. Wit no $$$ and hopes of getting any game to run, I gave it up and stuck to owning noobs in Call of Duty.

Fast forward to 2021, and I decided that since gaming went to shit I'd look back at some titles I missed out on when I was coming up. Obviously, the Sims 3 was a biggie and h.o.l.y.s.h.i.t.

This game is perfect. Addicting game play, an open world, TONS of customization, great music (the fact that Need You Know is in this game is so 2009), and just a sense of care and polish you don't get from many games. I refuse to note the crashing errors because 1.) They're surprisingly not as bad as you'd think from a game this old and 2.) This wasn't really designed for Windows 10, despite the fact that it runs well regardless. If you have performance issues, there are a lot of simple things you can do to improve the performance or you can just download some mods.

What other game let's you play as a household of R. Kelly and die from sleep deprivation while stalking Lil' Bling outside his gated mansion? Or let's you play as an obese, vampire OJ Simpson and cause havoc on the town? None that I know of.

From the moment you dive into its virtual world, you're greeted with endless possibilities and a sense of freedom that's unparalleled. The level of detail in creating your Sims is astonishing, allowing you to sculpt their personalities, appearances, and aspirations to your heart's content.

But what truly sets The Sims 3 apart is its open-world environment. Gone are the loading screens between locations, replaced by a seamless and vibrant world that your Sims can explore at will. This change brings a new layer of depth to gameplay, as you watch your Sims traverse the neighborhood, forming relationships, pursuing careers, and engaging in a myriad of activities with a natural flow.

The customization options extend beyond just the Sims themselves, as you're given an incredible range of tools to design homes that reflect your imagination. The architecture and interior design possibilities are limitless, ensuring that every abode you create is a unique masterpiece.

The attention to detail is astounding, from the day-to-day routines of your Sims to the dynamic weather that affects their lives. This level of realism adds a sense of authenticity that draws you in and keeps you invested in the virtual lives you're shaping.

Whether you're a casual player or a dedicated simulation enthusiast, The Sims 3 offers something truly special. It's a game that encourages creativity, fosters relationships, and provides an escape into a world where your imagination can run wild.

Just in case someone is having Issues, here is a Guide that i make.

The Sims 3 - This is the solution to launch the game !!!

I have the solution, it is not necessary to patch or any type of mods, so if possible post this comment, because I have been looking for a solution for about 6 months that in the end is simple.

Step 1: Install the game, either via Steam or elsewhere.

Step 2: Open The Sims 3 (Desktop Icon After Installation)

Step 3: When the launcher is open we don't click play, instead we open the ""task manager"", right click on the sims 3 Launcher and click on ""go to details"".

Step 4: In the details, look for ""TheSims3LauncherW.exe"", right-click on it, and choose ""set affinity"". The numbers with the CPU will appear, the only one to be marked is the one that says ""CPU 1"", the others are to be left unmarked. then click ""OK"". (Note that this is the key step to make it work, but it's very, very simple.)

Step 6: Click Play on The sims 3 Launcher, everything is normal. when the game opens, the black screen with the EA symbol appears, we do not turn off the game, but go to the desktop and open the task manager again.

Step 7: in the task manager repeat the same steps, on the right side of the manager click on ""processes"", then right-click on ""The Sims 3"" and choose ""Go to details"".

Step 8: In the details search for ""TS3W.exe"" right-click and choose ""set affinity"". Mark all CPUs as enabled, the 5 CPUs must be marked. Then click ""OK"", close the Task manager and you are ready to play with the power of your computer.

Very simple steps, in 1 to 2 minutes the problem is solved.

Every time you play you have to do this, but it's very quick to do, it's not worth installing any kind of patch or mod, it's a simple solution.

Ps: The Guide works with mods or without mods, is the same solution. A big hug for you all",1693390192,1693390192,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Anyway, the Sims 3 is easily the best Sims game in my opinion, Sims 2 directly behind it. However, even though I have over 50 hours on record, it's not really my cup of tea nowadays.

This game is still fantastic as ever but be warned it takes a LOT of tweaking and modding to get it into a reasonable working state, especially in 2023. There's a steam guide for that and it's very, very long.

Even just the base game has so much more than Sims 4 has. I only own the base game, seasons, and pets for Sims 3 but have every single Sims 4 expansion, pack, stuff pack, etc for it and it still isn't as good as the minimal amount of objects I have in Sims 3. I'm not very fond of the controls but getting more used to them. Sims 4 is good but they are lacking so much after finally being able to completely compare them. I think I will be playing this religiously from now on.

UPDATE 8/18/23 -
I have decided to play this game more in order to get used to the controls, and I've also purchased more DLC for it. I can say without a doubt, that I really do love this game and it is such a nice break away from Sims 4. They continue to put out more expansion packs, more kits, etc but will not fix broken things with the game - which there is A LOT that needs to be fixed. I know by buying Sims 3 content I'm still putting money in their pocket, which sucks.. but at least it's a better game. I wish they would bring Sims 2 back but I don't see that ever happening, I would give anything to own that entire collection again.

The big downside to this game is the very long loading times. Especially if you own all the DLCs.

Neighborhoods work differently in Sims 3. Your whole neighborhood is active at once, and you can send your Sim off to walk around the whole place. A saved game covers every household of this neighborhood. The downside compared with Sims 4 is you can't visit other neighborhoods (but you can move a household to a new neighborhood).

Sims 4 has a buy mode search function, which Sims 3 really suffers for not having.

Sims 4 has more customisation of the actual Sims than this game.

Build mode is pretty good. There are a lot of fun workarounds you can find on youtube (the barn roof trick is one of the better ones to know). I can't decide whether Sims 3 or 4 has a better build mode, they're both good in different ways.

Sim Autonomy - I like the Sim and pet behaviours of this game more than Sims 4. In Sims 4, guests visit your house and barge into your Sim's bedroom to play games on their PC for the whole party. Sims 3's autonomy is a lot better than Sims 4's.

If you like Pets, then Sims 3 lets you control your pets directly. In Sims 4, you had to tell your Sim to tell the pet to do something. Sims 4 - if you don't tell your sim to tell their pet dog to go to bed at night, the dog will stand there looking at its bed until it passes out from fatigue.

The Steam Store has a bundle with all the DLCs, which for some reason does not appear on the main Sims 3 page.
https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/1247/The_Sims_3_Collection/
The downside is having all the DLCs really bloats the buy mode. You cannot easily turn off any DLCs. If you untick them in Steam properties, the game will not launch.

Expansion DLCs:
1 World Adventures - vacation locations of France, China and Egypt. 

2 Ambitions - Some great professions with fun minigames are added, such as Private Investigator, Architect, Ghost Hunter. Neigbhorhood - Twinbrook added, French Bayou theme.

3 Late Night - Vampires, Rock bands and Clubs. A Chicago/Seattle like neighborhood with high rise apartments.

4 Generations - Adds a whole lot more content for children. Buy this if you like raising families. Has no neighborhood, but has a lot of very nice prebuilt homes.

5 Pets - cats, dogs and horses! Neighborhood - Appaloosa Plains, a ranch town

6 Showtime - adds singing, magician, acrobat careers. Neighborhood is Starlight Shores, a Hollywood themed town. Starlight Shores has some nice retro buy-mode items and mid-century modernist architecture.

7 Supernatural - Adds fairies, witches, werewolves and zombies. Town - Moonlight Falls, Pacific Northwest / Twilight inspired.

8 Seasons - adds seasons. Also aliens.

9 University - adds a university campus neighborhood. Sims can't live in the neighborhood, it's more like a vacation location, they live there temporarily while they study. Upgrades smart phones and adds social groups (jocks, rebels and nerds).

10 Island Paradise - Isla Paradiso neighborhood, adds mermaids and lots of water-related activities.

11 Into the Future - Lets sims travel to the future neighborhood of Oasis Landing. Travelling back to the past will allow you to make changes that affect the future.

Most recommended expansions, depending on gameplay style: Ambitions, Late Night, Pets, Generations, Seasons, Supernatural.

The Stuff packs are all what they say on the tin. The Katy Perry Sweet Treats pack seems to no longer be available (basically tonnes of furniture that looked like cupcakes)

Mods: You need mods to solve a bunch of problems https://www.nraas.net/community/Mods-List
Error Trap, Master Controller, Overwatch and Story Progression are the most recommended.

See this guide for a lot of ways to improve the game https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1131162350

EA is greedy and terrible. Yet, I have spent over 5,000+ hours playing this game since it came out. The Sims 3 is a golden staple of its time and has insane replay value, with or without modding. Every session is never like the other. It's unpredictable and fun. You can create a monster man and fool around, world build for months creating a complex generational story, and even build whole towns to your liking if you learn how to use the World creating software.

Other than that, I was able to buy the game myself and start over with one human and two renevant zombies that are supposed to portray my own original characters as Sims. Yes, they're original characters I made: I'm a cartoonist in real-life as a hobby, and I tend to create my own characters on paper. Zombiepeople was not my initial work (that title goes to my original original characters in Rob & Nul) but I was able to use this game's Sim customization feature to retool them into my own Sim characters. People seem to do whatever with their Sims instead while I created my own as good-hearted, friendly, and non-judgemental in nature.

The collection bundle is tempting (I know because it tempted me (steam summer sale)) but you will NEED to follow a guide to make it ***playable***.

I am only a novice at modding, but there are some very helpful guides from the community on steam. I spent about 3 hours following guides to help with the game's performance and I was able to make it functional - I believe that if I can do it you can do it. It will crash/freeze every now and then, but I could probably do more research and mod it more to fix it further. For now I am just saving the game... often.

I bought the Seasons expansion in 2018 while it was on sale for $5.

And finally I missed a mega bundle deal some time after that, that had all the missing DLC's I didn't have for like $60 or something. I vowed that if I ever found a big deal like that again on Steam that I would buy it no matter what it cost me.

Because buying all the DLC for $450 is just stupid. (EA being EA)

The next bundle came in 2019. I got everything in a Mega Bundle deal, one being a Bundle of the Stuff Packs I was missing, and the other being a Bundle of the Expansion Packs I was missing. The total was $79.

(Also, this isn't me telling you to do it, but: They don't sell Katy Perry's DLC anymore. And for me, I wasn't accepting that. Let's just say... with a little Googling, you can get yourself a download of Katy Perry's Sweet Treats and install it into the files with the rest of the Packs, and the launcher lights up Katy Perry's Pack icon just like normal, and then you have the ""Complete Collection"")

Now, in today's age, I doubt you'll get that lucky anymore, with how hard they're pushing TS4. But honestly, if you ever find a deal like I did, snatch it up. The Sims 3 is far better than The Sims 4, even if it's a little choppy. Just get MasterController, and NRaas.

Those Mods handle cleaning up stuff around the world, and turning off stuff the NPCs leave on. And just generally makes it run a little better.

Then, personally, you should check out Fresh Prince's car mods for TS3. Because that open world is what makes TS3 better than TS4.

I tried TS4, and it just doesn't feel the same as TS3, even if it looks better I wouldn't take TS4 over TS3 any day.",1688182742,1688182742,True,1,0,0.50225222110748291,0,True,False,False

I absolutely LOVE The Sims 3. In my opinion, it's the greatest Sims game to be released so far. Sims 4 is so dull, lifeless, and repetitive. Sims 2 is amazing, but it lacks the open world.

It never gets boring or feels old to me, despite having played this game for so many years.

You have vehicles, can customize things to a specific color or pattern you want, etc. Graphics don't determine whether a game is better or not. It's always the story and gameplay of the game itself that determines that for me.

I love The Sims 3 so much, it is just a ton of nostalgia for me. I first bought this game at Walmart years ago actually, it was The Sims 3 Plus Pets CD for mac. However, macs are no longer made with a CD insert like they were at that time and I thought I would much rather just have the game in my steam library since I now am a windows user.
Anyways, I agree with people saying expansions are expensive but lets be honest about one thing. When you compare the expansions for The Sims 3 to the The Sims 4 expansions, its cheaper by A LOT. You can just click ""See All"" under the expansions pack tab on both of the games and here it's less. You don't need expansions to have fun although they add a lot to the game. You can get a lot of custom content for this game too, just watch a video for how to do that though.
If you really want expansions, wait for sales & save money for it. Besides that, this game is completely nostalgic and has an amazing soundtrack that I still remember in my mind to this day (:",1630273655,1687457478,True,1,0,0.504701733589172363,0,True,False,False

If you're only here for the meme of someone with almost 2000 hours in a game not recommending it, thank you for your participation, please find the nearest exit because I'm about to go on a long written rant about why I hate this game.

-------------

This is a full priced beta. Anyone who has played more than 10 hours of the game will realize VERY quickly that the Sims 3 is an unfinished game that's only made technically worse by its expansions. What's worse than this is the fact that they're still charging you full price for this piece of garbage. Models bug constantly. You need to have multiple save files in case of crashes or game breaking glitches. Certain expansions will just break your game entirely, I'M LOOKING AT YOU ISLAND EXPANSION. 

There is no technical support for this game, and GOD HELP YOU if you're trying to connect to the servers in modern day. There are online options that simply do not work at all, any longer. This might be where you remind me that this game is 14 years old. This is where I will remind you that they're still charging FULL PRICE for the game and its expansions. 

And yet somehow this is the best life simulator that's on the market right now.

Some people will prefer Sims 1, 2, or 4 to Sims 3 and I totally understand why. These have very different approaches than Sims 3. However, Sims 3 gives you a level of customization, narrative control, and user tools that none of the other games have. Even without mods, you can basically do whatever you want. 

If you can get it working.

If it doesn't bug out or crash on you.

If you pay enough money.

I blame two things for the Sims 3 being a bad game.

1. It's ahead of its time. I don't even think the tech is there now to completely fulfill every problem that exists in the game. There's just so MUCH of it. Graphic quality and animation fluidity aside, just the coding alone must have been hell on the developers for the sole reason of keeping track of everything. Even with my 1700+ hours I was still discovering new things that were possible in the game right up until my last uninstall. Even if it was technically possible to accomplish everything and make it even just slightly bug free, I don't think the average PC could run it. 

2. EA got its grubby little hands on it. I don't need to type out anything else to explain this to you, and that should tell you how bad this problem is. 

I'm going to say more things now, and then I'm going to conclude this review. These are criticisms regarding the PUBLISHER, which is relevant to this review. 

EA gets away with this because the majority of the Sims' player base is under 18. The majority of the people who play the Sims are not savvy with or educated on the markets, and have a very narrow concept of finances. That's not an insult to the players, this is a life experience thing. In 5 years you'll be looking back going 'ah man, I really should have done this and paid more attention to that', that's normal, we ALL have that happen ESPECIALLY with digital items.

My point is that a lot of people who buy into the Sims, people of ALL ages despite the scales being tipped in the favor of those older, don't actually realize what they're buying or what it's worth. EA shouldn't give things away for free, they're a business. They have employees and they provide a service, they need to make money. Charging full price for almost a 15 year old game, as well as every expansion that's come out for it, that's seeing no updates and no tech support isn't just scummy, it's dangerous. Server maintenance for online services is important, the older things are and the more stagnant they sit, the more risk there is to your information and account. I bet a lot of people have debit or credit card information linked to their online service accounts. Emails, birthdays, passwords, all of these things are vulnerable. 

You're screwed if you want to get into the online presence. You're screwed if you've been there in the past. You're screwed if you buy the wrong expansion. You're limited in the game if you only buy the base game. It will literally cost you hundreds of dollars to buy this decade and a half old game in order to see it in its full state, and you might not even be able to run it at all.

This game runs like crap on modern hardware. It gets super choppy, takes FOREVER to load on many screen transitions, and crashes frequently, and characters just stop functioning at times.  Steam's customer service with my issue has been atrocious.  Steam just keeps giving me the wild goose chase linking me to tips to make it work (which i tried, and it didn't work) instead of just making the customer happy and giving a refund.  It's not like they lost the product, it's just a copy of software! I DID NOT PLAY THE GAME FOR 6 HOURS!!   It didn't shut down properly after the first FAILED ATTEMPT TO PLAY IT and it ran up the ""clock"".  i spent those 6 hours trying to implement the ""fixes"" (that didn't work) and doing research on the problem.  Apparently it happens to a LOT of people on this game.  if Steam had just given the refund of $110 for the game and DLC bundle i paid for, i would have used it on Sims 4 DLC's...  

No worries though.  I WONT be spending any more money on this platform unless i get my much deserved refund.  I'll buy my games elsewhere from now on.

You have a house and a sim lock inside, without a door, making you money because you are exploiting your fellow 'workers' to write books for you.

I first got The Sims 3 when DVD discs where still relevant, and my first expansion pack was Late Night and Supernatural. I have very fond memories of my sim (I think it was Lola) wooing Matthew Hamming (that rich 4/5 star celeb dude) and cheating on her bf, and in Supernatural's town I made a vampire sim bite most of the people in the town to make them into vampires. Vampire dominance for the win! 

I also remember getting Island Paradise (which is very buggy on my pc now :( ) and having amazing houseboats and trying to make a good hotel, whilst also trying to make my male sim into a mermaid, and exploring the map as it was very cool to see all the cool little details on the map.

I then got all the other expansion packs, but other than World Adventures, Into the Future (I have my qualms with it, though) and Pets, they were either:

- Buggy (Island Paradise, and the Zombies from Supernaturals)

- Laggy (Island Paradise was SO laggy, i couldn't even play for longer than 20 minutes)

- Lacklustre (Diesel Stuff and some of the other packs, for the money they charged back at least 7 years ago is astonishing... even now. There wasn't very many items to make your homes unique, especially if you've played the game for so long that every item just looks... meh. Or you have to buy ""SimPoints"" from the ol' Sims website to access other item packs or other maps.)

- Prone to crashes, especially on maps like Isla Paradiso (from Island paradise expansion pack) and even Moonlight Falls (Supernatural)

It's a real shame because The Sims 3 was a staple in my gaming collection, as it was my childhood game. But coming back to this and seeing the state it is in, is depressing. EA has really milked it dry, and left it to rot.

If you have gotten down here and read through all that, thanks for reading. If you still do want to buy it, there are mods you can download to fix some of the issues in The Sims 3 and improve performance and adds in commands if your sim(s) are bugging out, though do be careful of Custom Content sites that aren't official or if they aren't from NexusMods (not sure if Steam Workshop actually works with the Sims? A bit strange, they're missing out there). Hope this helps!",1683139743,1683139743,False,1,0,0.508928596973419189,0,True,False,False

No longer do you need to look at loading screens to load into new lots; simply go to the map and click the lot you want to go to, and then there you go. The only downside to the open world is the performance issues it brings, especially on modern systems.

The games database for GPUs stopped being updated around 2014, if I remember correctly, and because of this, it won't recognise newer GPUs. There are guides on Steam and online that show you how to fix this and many other problems with this game, but the amount of fixes you have to do for an enjoyable experience is almost absurd. These problems are all easily fixable; it's just that it shouldn't really be required of the user to fix them. Update your game, EA!

Besides these issues, this game is an absolute blast to play, and the majority of the DLCs are very enjoyable, especially Seasons. Tonnes of love have been put into this game, and the amount of stuff you can do is pretty much endless. It is absolutely worth picking this game up, but wait for a sale.

EA is charging way too much for a decade-old game; they even increased the price of the DLCs! As of writing this review, the game and all of its DLCs are currently on sale, and there is a complete collection of all the DLC available on Steam that is being hidden by EA. Thankfully, there are some very nice people in the review section that have left links to the collection, so if you're going to buy the DLC, do it through that bundle. You will be saving yourself a tonne of money.",1620000736,1682069492,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

Anyways, great game. Has a few quirks like lag spikes in build mode, CAS and when using the color wheel but its no big deal if you are a patient person, it is an old game after all. I like that this is more flushed out than sims 4 if I'm being fully honest though. There's just so much ""life"" in this game that feels absent in sims 4 that makes it very enjoyable.

The ability for Sims to do things that are interactive with actual animations (such as slow dancing as a couple holding onto one another, sparring together in martial arts, jamming with other musicians, sets it apart from Sims 4 in which most ""together"" interactions are done more by themselves, next to someone else doing it by themselves, in parallel without any apparent interaction.  The worlds are bursting with lots, zany townies, playable buildings (though grocery shopping, grade school, and many others are rabbit holes). You don't have the flexibility of going between worlds/towns the way you could in Sims 4, though. But you also don't have loading screens when you leave your house to go visit your neighbor, or even walk or drive down to the beach or riverside, and you can travel. 

Another reason to get Sims 3 on Steam, is that it uses the next-to-latest version instead of the latest, which is good because the latest version eliminated Create-A-World for those who want to form worlds of their own design, choose venues and housing, and share those worlds with each other.

Sims 3 does need NRAAS mods and for the user to learn the do's and don'ts to keep it in good running order due to issues with modern systems and some issues that were baked in from the start (but all Sims games have issues that were baked in from the start and require management). but it seems a small price to play for better gameplay and immersion.",1641649269,1679326412,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False
47890,135016338,76561198418563172,87,3,16588,0,9896,1697818142,"I moved into a cheap one bedroom house with a household of four people.

Over the years, I rarely spoke to any of them. Didn't have any friends, except the car I bought. My sister became the CEO of a multinational corporation, one roommate landed on mars, and the other became the president of the United States of America.

However, I was stuck upstairs, in a (now furnished) attic remodeled to be a study because the house was so small, behind a computer churning out smut novels to my 3 adoring fans and gaining less than $500 a week in royalties- I worked a desk job at a low-budget newspaper company to try to even keep up with the success around me. 

Eventually, the Astronaut got married, moved out, had a kid, started a life. I heard he died peacefully in his sleep. His passing got me thinking about myself; is there anything more than this minutia? Anything more than the grind of living day to day in this infernal repetitive hell?

I took a trip to the graveyard, visiting the headstone of my passed acquaintance, to think about how I could possibly save my future. Sat down on a bench near a pond and observed the carefree and unaware fish meander about and passively feed on algae and the like. Didn't really keep track of time, It's pretty dark out now. In the corner of my eye a dim, pale-blue glow engulfed half of the bench. Slowly and carefully, a Translucent, Floating, Dripping(???), 30-something woman sat down next to me. I wasn't sure if i accidentally ate some bad food or maybe i was up too late, but before me she sat, as real as i could perceive.
She introduced herself. I put the immediate shock behind me and hesitantly introduced myself.
We talked for hours, eventually we started flirting.
I left that graveyard that night with a renewed sense of self esteem and a kiss from a hot ghost milf.
I now KNEW what I had to do.

I quit my job.
I petitioned the graveyard to give me her headstone.
I committed a heinous sin against the gods and paid mystical people money I don't have to allow her to remain in the realm of the living during all hours of the day.

With both of our lives together planned and the road forward paved, our love blossomed. With all the additional free time away from work I fixed my social life, purchased properties, continued my writing, and furthered hobbies I haven't touched in years. She saved my life from ruin and I couldn't thank her enough. I proposed to her on a quiet beach at sunset.

Before I knew it, I was pregnant. Had three little ghost babies with her. Even though I hated children, seeing my own fruit grow before my eyes was really moving.

The president died. I didn't attend his funeral, neither did my sister. 
The reality is that we were all aging. I could start to count my grey hairs and my older sister already had a head of silver. 
I thought about my wife. Her age suspended in time, just like she was the day she drowned.

She was at work. I was sitting on the beach, next to the ruined pier, watching the starts orbit above me, immutable and piercing as they would ever be. I look to the heavens, up towards the dark and hallowed sky. That night, one lone star in the sky was unfamiliar, larger and brighter than the rest. On closer inspection, it appears to be getting brighter by the sec-

I awoke on a small wooden boat opposite to a hooded figure with dark robes, rowing aimlessly across a black sea with no horizon. I didn't speak. After a few moments of silence, he looked up, noticed me, and calmly removed his oars from the water. Setting the oars besides him, he told me that it was painless, and that nobody was around to witness my body become viscera. I asked him what he meant. He took his hood off, his flesh was missing entirely from his body. He told me that he was the harbinger of souls, and that I had died. I stood up and begged him to return me to my family. He shook his head and told me there was nothing he could do. I began to sob. He snapped his fingers and everything went black. 

I was in bed. My wife was besides me. It was dark outside. Bad dream. I was kinda thirsty, and a little cold. Some tea would warm me up. I went to remove my blankets, but from beneath them came a flaming hand glowing with a fierce orange hue. I screamed. Jeannie stood up and seeing my distress, immediately went to comfort me. She tells me that I had died. She took my tombstone to the mystics like I did hers and made me like her, an immortal spirit unbeholden to societal expectation. I began to cry, I'm not sure if they were tears of joy or sorrow.

I do not know what gods put me on this earth and I do not know what sick form of humour they have. But I am thankful for the boons they have gifted me. This new life, this new ME, is invigorating. I knew that from this day forward I would seize every single day and enjoy every bestowed aspect of my new self. I am now, finally, me.

It balances Mood icons, character expression/NCPs/customization, Wishes, the building, random encounters better than any Sims game in my own opinion. Super fun! 

Literally does not work on modern PC's. I say modern as in Windows 11 or 12th gen Intel Core processors. It is, I think, unfair to recommend a game that literally does not run without knowledge of modding on a modern device. Even when the Sims 3 DID run it ran badly. The memory leak is so bad and chews your RAM up so much I personally modded anyways just for some patches. 

Pricing and DLC:
One DLC is no longer available(lost license with Katy Perry). The SIms 3 is super old, well over a decade actually as of writing, and yet it and all its DLC are ~$20 USD. 19 DLC at $19.99 USD plus base game, which although plenty fun is bare bones considering the amount of content locked behind said DLC. To own all of The Sims 3 game+DLC is ~$400 USD(no tax). But that's unfair! Sales and bundles exist and I should take advantage! For a decade+ old game that rarely goes on sale, bundled with DLC I might not even want, anyways! With all the bugs and no fixes from the DLC's own issues they had a decade or longer ago! Nothing new for The Sims fan, doesn't mean it's right.

Generic pro-tips for the interested:

-Dumpster dive regularly for random fun items and easy cash selling free stuff

-Play randomly to get the most out of the game over repeating 'your' ideal family. It's more interesting and fun to explore

-Mod the game to save your PC some trouble",1679011679,1679012587,False,54,3,0.775459527969360352,0,True,False,False

TL;DR: Check out Anime_Boom's wonderful ""The Sims 3 Performance & Bug Fix Guide"". If you like management games and life sims, and if that seems like a reasonable amount of work to put in just to enjoy a game beyond an extremely cursory level (Wherein you'll have to accept the presence of bugs that, at times, can ruin entire save files), then you'll have a total blast with this game! If not, I'd look elsewhere. The Sims 2 is also pretty busted, but it can still work as an alternative.
---

A good summation of that is the fact that my playtime for TS3 is actually *much* higher than the 93 hours Steam has logged, but it can't track my playtime anymore because I've had to start bypassing the launcher when I load it up. If I don't, the game gets stuck running in my system tray, and it won't close out normally when I quit.

If you're playing with hardware that's even remotely modern, you'll need to manually reach into the game's guts to force it to recognize your graphics card, or else it'll act like you don't have one at all. You'll also need to manually allow it to utilize more system RAM, because on default it caps at 2 gigs. So basically, the better your hardware, the worse this game will run.

In terms of actual gameplay, the main things that makes this game stand out from others in the franchise are Create a Style (Wherein you can edit almost any piece of furniture or clothing to be whatever color, pattern, or texture you desire, which is an INCREDIBLE feature) and the Story Progression, which I /LOVE/, to the extent that it makes it hard to go back to TS2 (Which I do prefer in a lot of respects otherwise) now that I'm accustomed to it. Watching your town grow and change is really nice, especially for Legacy challenges. But.. Oh good lord, the save bloat. Even with using every possible tweak, mod, etc, imaginable to help with performance and reduce bloat, my most recent Legacy challenge wound up bloating so much by generation 5 that the game refused to save anymore. I had to give in and download Onebeld's Regul Save Cleaner in order to trim it down and make it playable again. A lot of people turn off story progression just to avoid that issue, and I can't really blame them. 

Still, the animations are cute, this iteration of Create a Sim gives you a lot of freedom to work with in creating unique sims, and the traits are a really fun direction to take in terms of giving sims distinct personalities. I'd recommend this game any day over the Sims 4, even with its bugs, but if you're not interested in putting in all the work I alluded to above for the sake of Story Progression, traits, and Create a Style, then I'd just go with the Sims 2. It's still broken, but at least it's held together with duct tape vs the stale bubblegum keeping this game from falling to pieces.",1678215617,1678215617,False,3,0,0.580040812492370605,0,True,False,False

Infinitely better base game than Sims 4. It's utterly hilarious that TS4 actually went free-to-play recently, while TS3 remains a purchased product. That alone should say something about the nature of EA (and the sales fee Steam dips their break into) and the future stake of The Sims series. Do not buy the newer games; everything they do, will, and can offer - older games offered for free, out the gate, no DLC or expansion packs. If you grew up on Sims 1 and 2, you will enjoy Sims 3. And if you don't, you never understood the core concept. Even TS3 is too newage and trendy for my tastes, and it's a fourteen-year-old game! TS4 is only 9 years old, but the modern trends of cash grabbing and EA thirst is clear. A sad, sad, backwards world when even say, Ubisoft, is a well-better-moraled company than Electronic Arts. Please. Stop entertaining EA's degeneracy of selling overpriced expansions for just about any feature the core game ought more than feature. Stop letting addons become a game's success. Buy a solid game for $20; do not claim a free game only to be baited into buying several short-change and phoned-in expansions packs to make a F2P experience more enjoyable. The Sims 4 is a trap, even more than The Sims 3 is definitely one. At least TS3 is a classic, and its collection seen as worthy and honorable in classical gaming. Rant over. Enjoy what you enjoy, but if it's a Sims game other than 2 or 3, you're wrong, and should have asked mommy or daddy before using the computer.

Sims 3 is really freaking good in an old kind of clunky and chaotic way. I'm playing this [so far] on my 7 or 8 year old laptop so initial loading times are long, there's some frame rate hiccups and crashes but seeming only when using a monitor.

The biggest change that I knew and cared about going back from 4 to 3 was the separation of build and buy mode. I'd heard it was insanely annoying to load between the two but honestly... it's not that bad in my experience. It's about the same length of time as switching categories in Sims 4 for me, so about a second or two. Other than that... it's pretty good. The lighting is a lot worse than 4 and is a bit hard to properly light everything, and the overall graphics are... muddy. Everything is dark and almost over textured if that makes sense, but it's still possible to make good looking early to mid 2000's houses.

And that's where a lot of the joy comes from for me, this is truly a step back in time to the early to mid 2000's in all it's quesitonable glory. The Emo-over and guy liner, the *juicy* pants, the fur collared vests... it's glorious!

TL;DR. For me, the game runs fine, with only a few crashes. build buy is find seperated, and the color wheel is honestly a game changer in every way. The gameplay is the same, though a bit clunkier due to lack of mutlitasking, but it's still a very good game.

HOWEVER. I would recommend buying this on Origin/EA App as it's got 3 extra patches and the ability to buy 3 or 4 different worlds from Origin it's self rather than the in game MTX store, and they are not available on Steam. Also, the expansion pricing is very different and I think goes on sale more often? Overall all, amazing game and worth a check out.",1675680590,1675680590,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Sims 3 has tons of DLC, most of which is pretty good, but not all of which play nicely with one another. There are some unfortunate dependencies which break the game entirely (depending on your operating system) if you don't install them in the right order. The content can become a bit overwhelming, with every young sim going to university all the time and random extended vacations to Egypt and spontaneously becoming a vampire... it's just a lot. Add in the stuff packs and all the community content... 

Oh yeah, all of it is micro-monetized like crazy. At the time I bought the game and DLC, it would have been easy to sink two or three hundred dollars into all of it... is it worth all that much? At the time, it was. Now, maybe not.

The Sims 3 is one of my nostalgia games, along with Zoo Tycoon 2 and Spore. Some games I could play practically before I could walk.
The Sims 3 is without a doubt my favorite installment of the Sims Franchise.
It has more wack and severe optimization issues at times, but these problems can be helped with downloadable files you can find online to install into the package if you so wish.

The Sims 3 is in my opinion superior to The Sims 4 and does not inhibit qualities that prevent the player from having more fun and freedom with the game, and your sims will feel much more personable.
It does not tackle build mode with as much finesse, but has much more personalization with a color wheel and endless textures to choose from.

It runs a lot better and smoother, I don't have to deal with the bloat heavy launcher as I play, and I've just had a better experience with this version than ever before. There are some new bugs that I keep seeing in my gameplay from time to time that I didn't see too much from the 8 years of playing the Origin/retail version, but nothing too game breaking and that NRaas can't fix. But, I've also noticed that I can play with the same family for a much longer period of time before it gets too laggy to the point it's barely playable, which happened a lot to me when I played retail when I'd get around the in game 5-6 week mark. So if you are planning to play a save that you'd like to have for a long time, Steam is 100% the way to go. I would heavily recommend the Steam version of this game to anyone who is a new player, or an experienced player like me who hated Origin. I also recommend using NRaas mods/game fixes/smooth patch to help the game run smoother, which also works so much better than retail.

The Sims 3 follows up from the previous game, while the previous game had solid emphasis with its memory, storytelling, CAW, wants and fears, and the setting up shop system; the third installment does fall short in some of the areas, they excel with its open world design, ditching loading screens altogether, though is not entirely avoided when travelling between worlds.

The game introduces the new moodlet system which pretty much determines the mood of your sim, compared to the previous game where mood is determined by your current sim's needs. They've also introduced the powerful CAS system (create-a-style) where in you can fully style any object or clothes in the game, which is honestly mind blowing.

Though the game has dropped some of the features from the previous game such as the good memory and fear system, they're replaced with inferior but not bad systems; fears have been dropped altogether, now only offering wish or wants, memories have less impact in the game and overall more clunky with a lot of insignificant memories clogging up the sim's memory. I do emphasize that although they've dropped or downgraded some of the system, it doesn't mean that the game has fallen off in terms of gameplay, as most of them are really not noticeable to the regular playerbase.

The game also provide excellent value for each expansion packs offered, much more feature-packed compared to the previous installments of the series, and definitely much more than the ridiculously overpriced, greedy, and lackluster expansion packs of The Sims 4. I could not say for the stuff packs as they were the first signs of how greedy EA can be, and it shows.

Horses, Cars, Future Tech, Supernatural stuff, Ambitions, family units that feel like family.

It'll still end up costing you more than the average 2009 game on sale though, because some companies don't want to price their games fairly.
You'll also likely need to install plenty of mods to get this game working properly again, those mods are thankfully free of charge.

By buying here the only thing you lose out on is
 1. Katy Perry pack (who ACTUALLY cares about that though)
2. Pets expansion key not working with Origin (?) I believe Origin can be contacted though to resolve this

As of right now, you don't require Origin to launch the game or even to play it? I don't even have Origin installed on my PC right now so idk what some people are talking about.

You can use the create-a-world official program, however, it won't work with Steam launcher so you can either use Origin for it (easy way) or muck around with PC registry edits. There are guides for it and should be easy enough if you follow them well.

There's also this weird thing with the launcher where every time I try closing it it says ""Stop! You're uploading files, are you SURE?"" and no, I am not uploading files? I have nothing to upload? A few times I tried shutting down my PC to have this stupid dialog window keeping it on all night.

Anyway, this game is the superior Sims game in every way. I've been playing Sims 3 since it came out and I am still to this day discovering new things. The modding capabilities are also pretty fun!

While I would love to be into Sims 4 I just can't get over how ugly it is.. Not to mention the HORRID UI. What an eyesore of a game.

Yeah, the Sims franchise is that for me. I've been playing since the original launched and have been hooked. Sims 2 and Sims 3 both brought really great features to the game. Sims 4 had a number of cool ideas, but the longevity of that game fizzled out for me and I keep finding my way back to #3. Much like coming home for the holidays, I can't seem to get out of committing my time to this. 

The reason this doesn't get a resounding recommendation is mostly for the quality of life issues. 

- There are dozens of expansions/content packs. If you wanted to own all of them, it would cost a pretty penny. 

- The game is glitchy and crashes like it gets paid to do so if you don't mod it with 3rd party mods. The number of times my game has crashed on me and I've lost hours of progress is way too high. There are mods to add an autosave feature, but the idea that that wasn't a native feature is mind boggling.

- It is an absolute resource hog. The base game was released in 2012. I am writing to you from 2022 on a brand new gaming PC and before I adjusted my VSync settings, it sounded like it was preparing to take off. 

On the other hand though, this game excels in many things. 
- Infinite customizability. I absolutely love how you can change the aesthetics on literally every item in the game, from color to pattern and material. Removing this from Sims 4 was a big loss for my playstyle.

- Character. I don't mean actual NPCs, but I love how much more expression the Sims you make have in this. You can actually see the individual animations as they go through life. The personality traits you assign them really guide their decisions and desires. Moodlets and emotions were a new feature from Sims 2 and it really helped to flesh out your Sim creations.

- Open world. The load screens might be a bit long up front, but once you are in you can traverse the entire map without pause. It is lovely to just wander over to the local bar or the neighbor's house without having to stop and decide if it is worth dealing with another load screen to get there.

So. Do I recommend this? I mean, I've been playing since 1999. 23 years as of writing this (good lord). So clearly I'm a Sims fan for life. However, this is a deep rabbit hole. Be ready to lose months, if not years of your life to building that perfect kitchen, or watching your legacy famly grow.


For the record, this is just mechanics. I haven't even touched on how bizarre some scenarios can get if you leave your Sim to their own devices. For example, one of my weirdest days one of my characters was struck by lightning, got arrested and when he got home, ended up abducted by aliens (when he was trying to run away from zombies).

It uses an open-world concept, not used before or since.

Also, I got this and not Sims 4 because, at the time I bought it, it was the only Sims game on Steam.

PROS:
Ghosts exist in the base game and have since launch, and they're pretty chill like they'd probably be in real life seeing as they're just dead people. This also means that death is not necessarily the end for a Sim.
If I'm feeling sadistic, I can be cruel to the Sims, though I can also care for them when I want them to do well.
Cheats make the game much more fun.
Can be modded, which can enhance the game in many different ways.
You can make your own story because the Sims speak gibberish.
Registering the base game rewarded me with a new world to play in.
Registering each Expansion Pack gets me additional content from the Sims 3 Store with no additional payment (registering Stuff packs doesn't do this but I did it anyway with the only stuff pack I have).
The base game used to cost $50 and the Expansion Packs used to cost $40, but both are now at a permanent discount such that they now cost just $20 each, which is the same as every Stuff Pack has always been (except for the Katy Perry one that's no longer being sold, which costed $30 when it was still being sold and probably costs way more secondhand due to being discontinued)

CONS:
Lags a lot, though editing config files the right way can make it far faster.
All of the content packs, both Expansion Packs and Stuff Packs, all cost $20, the same as the full game. It adds up quickly if you want all the content, including the Sims 3 Store content.
Sims 3 Store requires me to fork over even more money to get the majority of its content.
Ghosts can die of old age, though they just move onto the Netherworld (Sims afterlife) and permanently leave the game world.
Sometimes, the custom settings reset themselves.

I guess I will go back to that computer to play this, plus the Sims 2 ultimate collection since that game does not even show up in my collection when EA app is online.

Its a huge timesink where you recreate an idealistic life while neglecting your own.

This would be a kind of half-hearted joke review as the game does have a very catharthic sense of fun all in all, but the excessive dlc definitely doesn't help endear the game, I have ambitions, Late Night and generations Expansions and the game feels heavily incomplete without them, the other ones are relatively passable but the 3 aforementioned EPs (alongside seasons) do feel neccessary.

 Given the fact I hear Sims 4 is even worse in this regard, I'm quite glad I skipped it, in fact, I always feel *heavily* reluctant to make any purchase for this game, I would say with the packs it is actually alot of fun, and very modular (unlike sims 4 at the moment).

 But irregardless, this game cannot get an honest review and still be positive, with such massive reservations i have about this addition to the series, especially since Origins blatantly neglects the steam version which can be easily broken, I did get my moneys worth out of it undeniably, but its almost a requisite more than entertainment at times, given the excessive cost.

If your a sim fan, you likely know a lot of these pitfalls and tricks, so here's what I found to be really good addons:
City Hub instead of neighbourhoods makes your sim feel in an expansive world
Ability to customize and paint outfits, furniture etc. is welcome
With the mentioned EPs, you get interactive careers added and a lot of new minigames and life goals for stuff like building robots, a true City as opposed to suburbs, Nightclubs and hot-spots to meet VIPs and get famous etc. 
Finally Generations heavily revamps all ages of your life and specific moments like weddings, Check the wiki for more details.

If your not a sims fan but are very interested in being one, I would pick up the base game first if you can get it for roughly 10 dollars max, but this is effectively a trial version, I have been steadily adding EPs year by year and the games cost has started to bloat, but indeed the game feels tellingly more complete, but at a cheap price, you can carefully evaluate it for yourself.

So the game is actually more like crack: Very addictive and rewarding in a petty way.... but also quite a drain on expenses... and the dealer is pretty shady hiimself (EA)",1410642508,1666119359,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-Base game isn't bare bones, unlike Sims 4
-While there's lots of DLC, not nearly as much pointless DLC unlike Sims 4

-World is very open, unlike Sim 4

If you're gonna get a Sims game on Steam, get Sims 3. Yes, it falls into the same trap of there being a lot of overpriced DLC, but it's still so much better than 4.

There is so much that can happen, and the city continues to move even if you're just watching the events of one household. Building homes has been drastically improved, and very gorgeous results can be obtained.

[b]⊖[/b]Cash shop features have snuck into the series, and it’s awful. Invasive even after the splash screen?? Why? The biggest thing for me is the music; Sims 1 had one of the best soundtracks out there, a series of incredible muzak renditions that filled the game with spirit. The overall soulless feel of this OST is worth mourning.

[b]✎[/b]Pricing for expansions is absolutely asinine. Do NOT buy any of this at full price. When DLC does go on sale, they go upwards to 75% off. Wishlist it and be patient. If you like to build worlds, this is the ultimate sandbox to play in. If you can step around all the microtransactions, you’ll find it’s a spectacular game worth your time. (I’ve put more time into S3, but they are not tracked. For reasons. :))

I finally decided to take a dive and get all the DLCs I could.

It was a bad idea.

This game runs like absolute hot garbage with all the DLCs active, on my PC anyway, and from what I've found, it's not just me, and it's not just my PC, that have this issue.

I've tried every other optimization mod I could find, and it still just runs like a dying dog.

Requested a refund for the DLC bundle I got, but at the end of the day, if you can't use the DLC in a game, why even bother getting the game? Go try Sims 4 I guess.

Normally I'd even say, this is better than Sims 4... Worse than Sims 2... But considering the game is just so unoptimized for newer PCs, and the DLCs break the game more than it already kinda was... Pass on this. Save yourself the struggle.",1598364210,1663596078,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Sims 3 packs are a lot more heftier than Sims 4 packs, S3Pets pack gave dogs, cats, horses, big&small birds, reptiles etc, (edit here: forgot to mention its world Appaloosa Plains and the animals items like bird cages and bird branches, if you have multiple branches in a room, birds will fly from branch to branch, think thats BRILLIANT and their's a good amount of cowboy looking house objects and BARN DOORS and also special unicorns). While S4Pets Pack gave just cats and dogs with their respective building items, clothes and world. S4 Vampires or Werewolves were two different packs; not that big of packs either but might be arguably better than what Werewolves and Vampires were in S3 Supernatural. I haven't played with any of these packs but Judging by what I've seen in other peoples play through's and such, I would personally say that Sims 3 Supernatural Pack was better! Not only are you getting Vampires and Werewolves but your getting Fairies, Zombies and Wizards! ALL in one pack. Zombies are more like the hypnotized Sims in S4 but if im remembering correctly, that was due to aliens and not a bite on the neck from a infected Sim.

Not to mention that Sims 3 and its packs are half it's price now since they released. But to give Sims 4 credit, the building and graphics are really really nice. Super easy to use in every way... EXCEPT THE FACT THAT SIMS 3 HAS SLIDERS FOR LITERALLY EVERYTHING!!!! You can even recolor wallpapers and objects like Rugs and Sofas!!! Besides that small little... GAME CHANGER, Sims 4 has better machanics. 

Even with that said, I'm gonna be playing Sims 3 with the Pets pack, Supernatural pack and probably a few others when I get bored of these ones, which I doubt will be anytime soon.

Something to note, Late Nights pack (Sims 3) has vampires too(why they did vampires in two different packs, idk?) but I heard it has some different stuff compared to Supernatural.

however, the game isn't properly optimized, the island dlc and back to the future dlc are not really worth it as they really clog the game up and just makes it run so slow, so you would have to rely on mods to have a proper experience. if you have a low end laptop it will definitely struggle with additional packs, so pick wisely when buying packs.

the base game is fun, and gameplay is fun when you carefully select what packs to play with, there is a 'bonus' store of content to purchase but ultimately it's not worth it to purchase said content. sadly, the create a sim, some of the build buy menus and even the start up menu is full of ads to entice you to purchase. a few worlds are locked behind these paywalls.

some cons ive noticed: it can be kind of hard to play in fullscreen mode because everything is so tiny, lag (very bad in build mode), the fear of crashing is very realistic, cas can be frustrating at times just because of the strange layout, no search bar for furniture, camera kind of sucks, and i dont really like how if you want to move to a new town you lose all your progress

Very Big problems with this game many you will eventually run into here is all the fixes

1. IF you have a 12 gen intel processer aka Alder Lake Cpu you will not be able to run the game and they havent fixed that ( I Had this exact problem and many of the problems will all look the same causing you to spend hours doing things that will not work)
The game will just go to launcher you click play and nothing happens 
now this problem will happen via if you installed the game at any point and now are reinstalling 
Simple fix just need to Registory Editor and fully wipe all sims 3 content

But for the Alder Lake Fix it requires a string of code to be writtin in an text document saved as a .ps1 and you run it with PowerShell you can find the thread with the code on eas message board thread look this up in google ""Sims 3 won't open: Alder Lake (Intel 12th-gen) CPU"" The code is written by a user named Mia

Essentially it will boot the game with one core and revert back once running she has fine tuned the script since december so it will work with orgin and all 12 gen cpus there was differnece in the code you used to have to write but no worries its fine tuned now.

But if you so happen to be a person where the game is not running for them i promise you there is a solution just dont give up but there is the list in a simpliar fashion of what it can be

1. Direct X9 Needs to be installed
2. 3.5 Net FRamework needs to be turned on
3. Hard wipe all sims 3 content from pc using cc cleaner and registory editor
4. IF you have 12 gen cpu must use script as said above

Those are all the conflicts i know of but again there is always a solution i spent personally 5 hours trying over and over until i found a thread by the wonderful sims 3 community in which through trial and error they found out 12gen cpus are a cause. If one proven solution doesnt work for you it is likely you need to move on and find another


I will say this new pcs tend to have a problems with this game but it is fixable


Good Luck To All

If you plan to get the base game, then sure, get this. If you're willing to get DLCs, custom content (mods), etc. then maybe just get the Sims 4.

Even if the DLCs in the Sims 4 aren't as expansive as the ones in 3, the custom content by the community is phenomenal. It's also simply just the latest entry and (i think) goes on sale more than the Sims 3 does. To get the least ripped off, you DO NOT buy anything when it's not discounted (which is pretty obvious, but still).

Also, while the open-world feature in this entry is a nice addition (and is often brought up to bring down the sims 4), I don't feel like it warrants the performance buff - somehow I can get a consistent 60fps in modern games like Elden Ring but not this. To be honest, I think story progression is more important, which took them till THIS year to add to the Sims 4 in form of Neighborhood stories.

Compared to other Sims games it has a lot less in the base game than the Sims 2, however it will more than make up for that with the DLC and creator content available. As for how it compares to the Sims 4, besides a bit dated graphics the Sims 3 is superior in every category compared to what can easily be called a gutted cash grab with little inspiration less.

The main downsides to the Sims 3 that is very noticeable is the loading time, if you have an SSD it isn't that bad, but for anything else prepare to wait a long time to the point you question whether the game froze or not (it didn't just wait). Beside that, the price tag on the DLC and base game is way too high for the year it came out. The DLC is a big cash sink, but do you research and pick what is right for you if you only want a few. As other reviews have pointed out the Sims 3 was effectively abandoned by EA by the time the Sims 4 came out.

There is so much to do in base game alone, without all the DLC. After playing sims 4 for two years and then coming onto sims 3, sims 3 has definitely become my favourite.

You do not need all of the DLC to get a lot of content for this game, I don't even have all of them just a few that I know I would like and use the most, it should be fairly easy to see what you would enjoy and wouldn't, and if you don't have an idea there are a lot of content creators on youtube who still play the sims 3.

There's plenty of customization for your sim, such as traits, hairstyles, and color. It's literally like living another life to escape from reality which is what really interested me. What really makes Sims 3 stand out is it's open world. I never got any frame rate drops because I have a good computer, but even if I did I would still see the open world as a highlight. It makes you F E E L like your living another life. Also, because this game was released in 2009, I have lots of nostalgia for that because I really enjoyed my younger years. Graphics have definitely aged though. Doesn't bother me that much, but hey I'm still downloading mods to improve the graphics.

The only negative thing I have to say about sims 3 is that the expansion packs are so expensive, and that some of them should be in the base game already. For example: Seasons, Ambitions, and Pets. Why do they cost as much as the game itself!? I can tolerate Ambitions and EVEN Pets, but SEASONS!? WHY!? During the 2022 summer sale I was hoping that sims 3 and it's dlc were on sale but NOPE. And so, I only bought the base game. 

9/10 should of made dying it's own expansion pack for $19.99

The new additions such as the open loading screen-free world and Create-A-Style are simply revolutionary and are very welcome additions. 

I do have some gripes with the game though. While the Create-A-Sim is certainly very detailed, I  find it difficult to make my Sims look like myself. That might be a me problem, but I've also found that some of the Sims I see in my worlds also look a bit like hodgepodge. The hairstyles also definitely didn't age too well, and I can't guarantee that you'll find one that will fit your Sim. If you're really into CAS and house-building, I suggest downloading stuff packs or custom content from the exchange.

I also found that the game can get a bit boring or tiresome without expansion packs or new worlds. After a generation of Sims I kind of lose the motivation to continue the family. The Sim lifespans are also too short for my taste, but with Generations, these spans become customizable.

While I do have a lot to say about my dislikes about the game, I do genuinely enjoy playing through a generation of Sims. These flaws aren't really enough to make me dislike The Sims 3 and don't have that significant of an effect on my opinion.

In the Sims 3 it feels less like EA is trying to absorb your wallet with the expansions, but there are some noticeable downsides in build mode and create-a-sim compared to Sims 4. If those are extremely important to you, I would recommend the Sims 4 over this if price per unit content isn't as important to you. As someone who loves building unique houses from scratch though, the Sims 3 can still satisfy your needs but it can be far more challenging to do so.

Of course people are going to give it flack for being unoptimized, but as long as you install the SmoothPatch mod (which is essential at this point), you're gonna get fast loading and stable performance.

This game let's you customize every little aspect about, well, everything. From the texture and color of your clothes, house, car, and items, to even bulldozing the entire town and building new stores and houses from scratch. This is the ultimate sandbox to mess around with, better than any other entry in the Sims series.

Sure the Sims may not be as human as in the Sims 2, but i can forgive it for having better objective-based gameplay than Sims 2 (in my opinion), there's plenty of other tweaks they gave to the AI, and while these creatures certainly aren't human compared to Sims 2, they're still fun to look at and mess around with however you want. The imagination's your limit

I highly recommend getting the Generations expansion too, you may find there are some things you wish to do that aren't available, more often than not it's available in Generations (which should have been stuff included in the base game to begin with)

The lore is deep and families from the Sims 2 are back. There is so much customization when it comes to building lots and adding clothes to your sims. The game also has music from real artists translated into Simlish for the simmer's pleasure. There are a ton of personality traits, aspirations, and I love the biography option. The player has so much creative choice and there are quite a few unique features that other sims games don't have. Sims react more realistically to life events than in the Sims 4 and it's an open-world, so you're not staring at a loading screen every time your sim leaves the house. The build and buy modes have a wider variety of textures with more customization, angling, and furniture. The settings menu itself has a lot of customization and preferences to offer, including changing your sims' lifespans. If you have the pets expansion, you can actually play as your pets, unlike in the Sims 4 where pets are NPCs. The game offers a tutorial for new players to help them navigate it's many features and also provides a small guidebook. You can also look up tips online. There is a social feature where you can message, friend, and like the posts of other simmers as well as post your own content. As a writer, I sometimes use this game to act out my stories and bring them to life.

Cons: The game isn't complete without buying expansion packs. This has always been a problem with the sims games as players have been urged from the very beginning to spend money on additional content. The game is also very glitchy and hasn't been updated in years due to the fact that EA is instead focusing on more recent projects (like the Sims 4.) The base game itself doesn't have a wide variety of clothes and hair styles and can get boring after a while. I've had to reinstall the game more than once due to bugs. The quality of the game is typical of it's time, but is considered outdated and low now. The interaction between the sims and objects could also use some improvement, especially since sims have a larger space bubble and therefore can't walk as freely, unlike in the Sims 4 where they can pretty much go wherever they want. The game also uses sliders instead of clicking and dragging, but this is mostly because that kind of feature hadn't really been introduced in video games yet and was a very new concept when this game was released. If you're a fan of sliders, this may be a good thing, but if you prefer clicking and dragging, you won't see any of that here. The sims' fears from the Sims 2 don't exist in this game. The game stores memories and life events, but the sims can't talk about them and are not as affected by them as they are in the Sims 2. It's also harder to play without using a mouse.

Tips and side-notes: Although this game is available on console, I recommend downloading it on PC as the controls are a lot easier and it'll be easier to type commands as well as other texts. When installing mods, test them out as sometimes files can conflict and become corrupted. You can view your downloaded content in the launcher under ""Downloads."" If you need technical support, since EA no longer provides it for this game, I recommend diving into the sims forums. Often times you'll find people experiencing a similar problem and there are experts who can help you out. I also recommend getting expansion packs while they're on sale. If you like the game, there are a number of Discord servers you can join that also provide technical support.

Overall, this is a good game and I love it. Cheers-

Edit: so the game randomly won't run for me anymore. I've tried everything from reinstalling the game, updating my drivers, and I've tried to uninstall custom content but the uninstaller doesn't work either. It just shows me a black screen and then crashes. I've also tried ""run without custom content"" and that doesn't work either. I've tried every forum and no one has been able to help me.",1600897960,1656872839,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I wish I could convince all those who have only tried the restrictive tragedy that is The Sims 4 to give this old beauty a try. The modding/custom content scene is alive and well, so fear not EA's stylistic choices with content. Highly customizable, so that from a Sim's clothing to their furniture, they are a real individual. Endless gaming possibilities with the expansions (all of which I recommend with the exception of Ambitions) and community challenges. Honestly, I still haven't seen everything the game has to offer, and I look forward to each new discovery. If you've never played this game before, get Seasons and Generations with it, but nothing else to start with. The best explorative experience comes when you add the expansions slowly, and give yourself time to delve into what each one brings to the game. If you buy many at once, you will be overwhelmed by additions and look at nothing thoroughly.

47890,117902649,76561198035585800,0,8,5282,0,5282,1604330087,"Sims 3 is still my nostalgic favorite. My preferred playstyle is running one household long-term, and 3 was the only one to really cater well to that. It's still unimaginable to me that EA/Maxis went back to the antiquated loading screen for travel to neighboring lots in Sims 4 after they effectively turned 3 into an open-world game that was actually worth exploring.

Unfortunately, when I go back and play it now its age definitely shows in some disappointing ways and I can't quite get immersed in it like I used to. And the prices are unconscionable for a nearly 15-year-old game (I managed to snag it on one of the rare instances it was actually on sale at an acceptable discount, though I still have a number of the discs around... erm... somewhere).

So my recommendation is predicated on two things: you, too, still have the deep nostalgia for what The Sims was a decade ago (and earlier) AND you can get it at a good price (like... Sims 4 is $5 most of the time, and they still want $20 for 3, c'mon, man 😂).

It's also worth noting, as of this writing in mid-2022, Maxis appears to be ramping up hiring again, which suggests a Sims 5 announcement is probably likely within the next year or so, AND Paralives is still in development, and if you're an optimist you could hope one or both of those titles could tap into what made Sims 3 so beloved, but modernize it and make it feel like something worth playing today.

You'll almost Guaranteed need a Save Cleaning Tool (Regul Save Cleaner may be around) (i had the issue of my chars no longer being able to use the inventory system)

As for the DLC's look for reviews i guess, i can only recommend Supernatural as it adds some interesting things to the game. (i have pets as well but, considering i need mods for it to be less... annoying i don't really use it, even though i sort of want to.)

You're obviously going to want to download clothing mods, though the more you mod, the more you'll want more mods so you'll probably reskin a lot of things.

This game doesn't run good (however, it's this or, Sims4.) Sims 4 may run better (i dont know or, care) but, it's also got a lot more DLC's that offer next to nothing. So it seems to me either, you'll go for aesthetic or, functionality. It just turns out that this one, while it does do pretty much all it needs to do. It's about as optimized/well made as a literal toaster.

However this is, probably the best of the Sims series and, knowing EA they'll probably ditch the series as a whole once Sims 4 stops being as popular.

1. The town and the characters therein are fully customizable.  You can switch from household to household, level up characters and then merge households to get your perfect group.  It's a minor disappointment that you cannot introduce a new life goal after one is achieved - but you can introduce a new character!
2. NRAAS Overwatch and Error keep the game running smoothly.
3. It doesn't take too long to amass enough 'money' to build the house of your dreams.
4. Electronic Arts may have disappointed many fans, but Sims 3 is all you need to have lots and lots of fun.

EA's adversion to including anything like religion mechanics also factors into my review - and this applies to all versions of the Sims, retroactively. Most other social simulators feature religion in some fashion; Rimworld has it as a DLC. Going Medieval features it natively. Dwarf Fortress added it eventually.

It has some significant issues - it's laggy, it doesn't close properly, the base game is a little bare - but despite these I still consider it my favorite mainline Sims game. The open world, which is still the series best idea to date, was removed from The Sims 4. If that was not the case, it would be a closer contest, but as-is, The Sims 3 is still the top of the heap in spite of its (admittedly significant) problems.

If you do plan on getting the game, a word regarding DLC: There are a few DLC that I would say are almost required for the ""full"" experience, those being Generations and Ambitions, which both add mechanics/features that are sure to enhance the experience of any playthrough. After that I would HIGHLY recommend Pets, Supernatural, University Life, and Seasons. These are all fantastic DLCs, but they're contextual enough that not every player necessarily ""needs"" them to fully enjoy the game (for example if you don't think you'll want to play with pets much, or worry too much about the teen/young adult stages, then you might be fine skipping Pets or University respectively).

TLDR: fantastic game that needs some fixing up to be truly flawless, buy some of the DLCs for sure, the rest are pretty much up to you",1653436012,1653436012,True,16,0,0.704338729381561279,0,True,False,False

The biggest of these setbacks is the fact that the AI pathing in this game is absolutely horrible. Whenever a Sim gets stuck (and they WILL get stuck), the entire game will freeze as it tries to fix the sim's path. What this means for you is sitting at a frozen screen incessantly for minutes at a time. Luckily, there is a mod that can help mitigate this problem--Nraas's Overwatch--but it won't completely solve the issue, so be aware of this problem before you decide to buy.

With the mod, the game becomes much more bearable, to the point where you can actually enjoy it! The Sims is considered one of the best ""life simulators"" for a reason. It's a unique game that has carved its own niche out in the gaming world. If you enjoy creating your own stories, constructing a house you've always dreamed of, or simply carrying out your most sadistic desires by killing the sims you create, then The Sims 3 might be the perfect game for you.

This was the last installment of the franchise I purchased with all of the expansions. I purchased the base Sims 4 title, but did not like it at all. 

This is my favorite in the franchise. It took many years to finally get all of the expansions, but even after all of these years, it is still a whole lot of fun. Although dated, and has its limitations, because it is so old.

As for the gameplay, it can get very laggy with all of the DLCs. So to pick up the pace, just pick the ones you like best. Otherwise, it is very fun! Things can get very overwhelming very quickly, but that's half the fun. It's also a kick in the pants to challenge yourself. Say, the homeless challenge, or try to have the maximum number of people in a household with little money. The list is endless. Although getting extremely rich in the game is not hard at all, so that can get boring at times.

Like the other Sims titles, DLC is very expensive. This goes on sale once in a while, but it is still very expensive. Unless you are into these kinds of games, get the base game before jumping in with both feet.

I see myself spending countless more hours with the game, probably reaching the three-digits by the end of the year. After all, The Sims 3 is arguably the best game of the Sims-franchise, not to mention being considerably cheaper when compared to it's successor, The Sims 4, which in turn lacks in many aspects, and is not an enjoyable experience unless you are ready to pay up.

Alas, the Sims 3, particularly in terms of the Steam version, has some issues Electronic Arts has fixed on the Origin version, but left in the Steam version.

In fact, most of the Sims games I’ve played are on console. That being said, I love this version of the game more than the PS3/X360 version of the game. But let’s go over some of the good and bad things about The Sims 3.

The game is very fun, and much easier than past iterations of the Sims. There’s lots of ways to interact with the town, and your household, and that expands tenfold with the more DLC you purchase. However, this doesn’t mean you should go and buy every DLC imaginable, as it has a tendency to get a little chaotic and laggy. Fortunately, DLC can be toggled off on Steam, and the bigger DLCs tend to introduce settings to control the chaos. 

Another issue I have with this game is how long it takes to actually get into the game. There’s 2-3 loading screens you must sit through (though you have the option of interacting with one of them) before you’re finally in a save. Maybe it’s because my system is on the lower end and lacks power and an SSD, but I find that it takes 5-10 minutes before I’m finally in. 

Technically problems aside, it’s still a really fun Sims game. And unlike The Sims 4, this game doesn’t require you to install Origin to play. All and all, I highly recommend, but I advise against playing on lower end computers.",1647745202,1647745202,True,15,0,0.640371263027191162,0,True,False,False

The gameplay loop is self-explanatory, create your Sim (or Sims), and watch them live their lives in a fictional version of reality. In terms of towns, you only have Sunset Valley. If you only own the base game. Via expansion packs or some Store content, There’s even more towns to choose from. It also has an open world, meaning you can say hi to your neighbors without a loading screen getting in the way. 

However, here’s where problems start to crop up. The more content you have in your game, the worst your game performs. What makes this even worst, is that the game doesn’t recognize modern GPUs. [i](same goes for modern CPUs)[/i] So, you’re gonna have to fix that yourself. If not, the game will stutter like crazy, and may crash on you, and since there’s no auto-save, I’ll let you fill in the blanks.

The game also aged very poorly visually, meaning you’ll be looking at very stiff animations, and plastic looking Sims. There’s also many issues that the devs didn’t address through the 5 years of support [i](2009-2014)[/i]. Some of these issues can be quite devastating if you’re doing a fan challenge or just playing it normally. Thankfully, mods are available to make playing the game less painful, but mods can only do so much to fix fundamental issues. Did I mention that the game is super buggy?

I do have nostalgia for the game, but I can’t let that blind me from the game core issues. You’ll have to jump through so many hoops just to play it on modern hardware. But if that’s not a problem for you, give it a shot. Do I think it’s a good starting point for the series? Yes and no. “Yes” because it’s very easy to jump in (along with mods), and “No” because of its many problems. Plus, the expansion packs and stuff packs are far too expensive. (CDN$ 26.99) So I’d say wait for a sale. 

[b]If you want a starting point, play The Sims 4. That game may have its own set of issues, but at least there’s still some fun to be had with the game.[/b]

   - fully customizable:  sims, houses, objects
   - get invested in your sim's lives
   - if you love Sims its the cheaper alternative to Sims 4 ($1400 for entire game)

CONS:
  - $$$, ~$500 for entire game = wait for a sale
  - very buggy with no support
  - many performance issues

Sims is one of those games that is enjoyable to get lost in.  Its absolutely fun customizing everything from your sim's appearance, to the housing they live in, to the objects that fill it.  You can get invested in your sims families and experiences and try out lots of different jobs and experiences.

One thing that is really important to note about it is: its a REALLY expensive experience. This makes it not very accessible to the common person.  At about $500 for the entire game, most of us don't or can't buy all of the packages.  You really have to wait for a sale to try out the pieces you are interested in.  That said it is still a LOT cheaper then Sims 4 at ~$1300 so you'll find people will still be playing Sims 3 for years to come.

Some of the packages like the University, Island Paradise and World Adventures have huge bugs and performance issues.  This is unfortunate because the content in them was fun.  You have to be careful installing DLC out of order because this makes it worse.  You might see your game stall, crash, or just make certain regions inaccessible or wipe out your progress.   I had one instance where I had just finished designing my home only to have the game crash and I lost hours of progress.  There is no autosaving. When I play I find myself avoiding some of the more buggy content.  Obviously since current development is on Sims 4 you won't see a lot of bug fixes.  You're pretty much stuck in the As-Is category.  So its a take it or leave it experience.  

Overall I wouldn't recommend putting money out on Sims 3.  Try some new indie life sim games instead.  They're a lot cheaper and less buggy.  They may not be as complete, but if you can't play the content because its buggy what's the difference?  If you can get a really good sale deal try it but remember you are taking a risk with University, World Adventures, and Island Paradise.",1647116567,1647116567,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

1. I love that the world is open, not instanced like in Sims 4. This means so many relationships are interactions are happening at the same. 
2. Love the customization. A couch can be made to look like a sleek leather one or a tacky animal print. It changes the mood and personality of your houses and this level of customization isn't around in future Sims. 
3. Love the expansions. Especially college, seasons, generations, and pets. Those all add so much to the game with things to do, places to go, and goals to accomplish. 
4. Love the progression. Skills are obtainable but it feels like you earn them. For example, you can become great at gardening but to have master gardener it really takes a Sims lifetime. Making it take a long amount of time and effort to get top skills makes the characters feel unique when they obtain them. 
5. Fun mods. Can download lots of mods to keep it fresh, running well, and to include more furniture and outfits than you ever dreamed of.

Keep in mind that I owned the CD version of this when it first came out, so double the hours that I have played on Steam.... 

This game is like the perfect drug dealer. It gives you just enough so that you want more. You shell out dollars for DLC just to get a little MORE. You spend hours on mods and stores just to get a little MORE. An expansion comes out and you throw dollars at it because you want MORE. A new location, a new magic well, a different profession. You want MORE and you throw dollars at it to make it make you happy.

The thing is though, you will never be satisfied. Each piece is like half an apple. Just enough to keep you going, but never enough to satiate your hunger. You can spend a psychotic amount of dollars on DLC that are extremely over priced. Half of the store 'premium' content doesn't even work (I am looking at you gondola). You search around and find mods to band-aid the bumps and bruises. But now, most all of the advice is from 2012 so it is a coin-toss as to whether or not it still applies. I am not going to say that this game isn't entertaining, that would be a lie. But ask yourself, does EA really have your best interest in mind? 

Someone for the love of all that is good in gaming, make a Sims alternative. Anything. It is probably too late for me but maybe we can save future generations from making their 112th socially awkward sim that is desperate for love but can never seem to get it right, the game glitches out, you put in a cheat code to fix it, now you have god-like power so why stick to this pretense that your sims are 'normal'? Make them super-rich and influential, then when you have all the money, toys, houses, and love interests, get bored, kill everyone, then feel shame for your war crimes, cry yourself to sleep while you have an existential crisis about whether or not you are a good person. Then do it again the next week.",1646426464,1646426464,False,13,5,0.618644058704376221,0,True,False,False

My scores for this game
Story : 10/10
Make your own story, I think that's enough 🤭
Graphics : 10/10
The graphics were great both from a distance and up close.
Musics & Sound : 10/10
The songs of this game are masterpieces, the dialogues are a language for themselves susu.🤩
Details : 10/10
This game contains a lot of details, it has so many details that if they count, it might be a book.
Game Play : 10/10
In the gameplay, all decisions are up to you. You can make any decision you want. Live freely in the game.
Variety : 10/10
The best variety of game DLCs for us is the best travel and animal DLC and the existence of zombies I can say.
Characterization : 10/10
Create your favorite character, city personalities are also very unique.
Optimization : 10/10
I did not lag a bit.
Multiplayer : 8/10 
First, I saw the multiplayer part of the game as weak, I only saw sending some objects and talking to friends, and the online part of the game in Iran needs a VPN.
Bugs : I did not see any particular bug.
Note : Not need connect origins🤗
Description : One of the games that I played a lot in my life, but after buying from Steam, I played for 70 hours, it was very attractive and it was an endless game. I implemented everything I wanted in this game. Thank you, EA.
Extra : ×××
Overall score : 10/10
I recommend 100% ,if you live in game.

Even with mods that directly address this issue it only stalls the inevitable.

Haven't played through all the DLCs thoroughly still. I know this is an EA game but I enjoy the Sims.

I bought all the expansions that isn't stuff packs during a winter sale where everything was 66% off. Still way too expensive in my opinion.

You're better off playing the Sims 2 or the Sims 4 as they both play much smoother and have tons of varied mods.

But, in the end; just because 3 is better than 4, doesn't mean 3 is all that good. The Sims 3 is hampered by aimless complexity, with no attempt to streamline its swelling feature-list into something measured and coherent.

+ Really fun game
+ Can create your own world
+ Lots of modding potential

- Controls are a bit confusing
- Base game doesn't contain all that much

Overall, I really enjoyed playing this game, it has occupied hours of my time and it has been great creating my owns characters and watching them progress through their lives. I much prefer this game to the newer 'The Sims 4' however the base game does lack content and to really get the best out of this game you will need to download mods for it. The controls were also a bit strange, I had to look up the controls on multiple occasions in order to build or rotate something.

S0...here we are back on the trusty pc, fighting with steam to dig up my deleted sims 3 games (and 8x dlc). Had to properly cleanse all previous sims files, and then the new installation began properly. Couple of old windows files needed, and we were away.
I do recall that this game did not run well if you loaded up too many expansions, so we will see what 10 years of technical advances can manage, but honestly expecting a crash now I've seen how long the save process is.
Already though I can see why I loved sims3 so much. Lots to do, places to visit, people to get acquainted with, and the dlc I have is also full of alternate lives.

I seen some things man ! I done some stuff man ! Happy days.

EDIT; the big freeze happened, but I used the tip on here to increase the ram usage and all is well atm.
Current witch has 3 alien friends and a hybrid baby. Been a busy gal!

EDIT 2;  OK, played a good deal on one character, concentrated on writing for a career and slowly got rich. Bought a big house and changed my traits. Tried horses, not for me, maxed out witchcraft and allied stuff. Went to China and maxed out the martial arts stuff. Got too many friends to cope with. Worth approx 5 million, and running out of stuff to try. Got A job in Sports, and suddenly everything started to seize up. Bugger. Well, now I've seen about all the game (again) and going to start over and stay simple. Yeah, that'll work, right?

Do not pay $30au for one stuff pack at full price, those prices are ridiculous considering how old the game is and how terribly it runs.
If you aren't buying the full collection, don't buy any stuff packs at all. Tumblr and Sims Resource have better custom content for free.

https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/1247/The_Sims_3_Collection/

Overall, it's an iconic game, I've been playing it since it first came out when I was a kid and it never gets old. It gets a recommendation over TS4 any day. 
So much more content and depth overall with the right expansions, its a much better experience. The game runs like shit but if you spend the time following some guides for performance, bug fixing, cleaning saves, and downloading NRass mods its entirely playable. Although it still has its certain issues, and is prone to crashing, so if that seems like it would be a problem for you I would skip it.

TS4 has loading screens opposed to TS3 open world, which = better performance for TS4, but completely ruins the flow of the game for me and I would take the instability of TS3 open world over the loading screens. It's more of a personal preference, but 3 is still a better game overall, no question.

If you are only wanting to pick up one or two expansions instead of the whole collection and don't know which ones you should go and check out Lazy Game Reviews Sims 3 playlist, he covers everything pretty thoroughly.

I think the sims 4 runs more smoothly on my PC though.

 I recommend this game if you like to have long term games that last a while or at least it was this way for me. You can also change the settings for your sims to last longer and more within the game, set up challenges for your sims and there life. I really liked to try to make a huge family tree. If you like to be creative you'll probably love this game because you can make up a story line, do what you want, and so much more. I think it's an awesome game.

Over all the game is super good to me the only problems I have had is how it cost so much, it being slow or lagging sometimes, and being so obsessed with the game.

Pro: Sims 3 is great for storytelling. The open world is really immersive, global story progression brings it to life, NPC and sim autonomous actions are fun and surprising. You always want to dig for more, see what else your Sim can do, what else the world has to offer. Racoons, deers, horses, birds, whut! Control of house pets makes you feel like you know them better. So many personality types, available themes. It's hard to get bored. And, of course, the style customization in build/buy is incomparable.

Con: Sims 3 really really really fails on the UX, for me that breaks the same immersion and drags game play. The clunky early-2000 game interface could be overlooked if not for the genuinely buggy build mode interactions (just adding a window can be exhausting); the icons designed for lower resolution monitors that are now almost too small to distinguish could be forgiven if they had provided a SEARCH function (wth is going on with those categories); the sims point store could be ignored if they weren't constantly advertising promos; the worlds are beautiful but saves are silo'd; why isn't there a calendar?; and then there is the embarrassing same-ness of body builds, every ethnicity feels like a color variation of the same thing. From a S4 pov you can see why EA decided to scrap this and start over.

In the end, 5/5 - it's a tie for me although I'll probably lean towards S4 because I love to build and am spoiled by moving and copying rooms. If Sims 5 could merge the strengths of each we'd have a real winner. For now I'll appreciate what each can offer because it's just a game and not worth stressing over.",1642373848,1642373848,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The only reason I bought it is that I don't bother with downloading pirated copies anymore and the game was on 'sale'. 

Anyway apart from the absurd pricing (not even AAA titles released around 2009 still cost this much) the DLC grab is the worst I've ever seen (compared to it Payday 2 and Rome Total War II shine for their decency) and the game is so incomplete without any of them that... I won't even finish the phrase. What I suggested to do before I edited my review could have earned me a ban.

Finally the only reason I'm wasting my time writing this, really, is that as I mentioned above the game doesn't work properly. Compatibility problems with W7 and 8 are massive and the troubleshooting required is at times just too much. I've been able to play some 4 hours and after relaunching the game everything turned wrong. First the costant crashing every 10 minutes, then every 5 and finally the freezing (every 2 or so). I tried to update again my gpu drivers only to find out the game does not recognise it and pick the built in intel card (playing on a laptop). Not saying the game will never work, but like Bethesda did with FO3 a label stating there are issues with newer systems and graphic cards should be added to the store page.

I am 41.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

One of the best things is the way the lots are semi-open to the wide world: you can just walk out of one and into another, get in a car, drive around town, go to hangouts, etc. I love the busy, full towns with loads of places to work and have fun as well as all the residential lots full of sims, that you can visit and get to know. It's quite easy to design the worlds: much easier than in Sims 4.
My favourite expansions and game packs have been University Life (so good!) Island Paradise and Ambitions (being a firefighter is great!) I also love the world adventure one. The university and world adventures add benefits to your sims and they don't get any older and neither to the folks back home, plus they're just such fun experiences.
I like Seasons: I think it has a lot of perks, but it rains way too much and is cold too often too. It's a weird combination with island paradise! I ended up switching it off.
There have been some awesome worlds and other additions over the years too. like the Italian place with the pizza ovens, and the boardwalk with the roller coasters.
I never use cheats (I did a bit back in Sims 2 days) and Sims 3 is so playable without them.
I don't really like the obsession with the signs of the zodiac, and alien abduction is just annoying and boring. Also ghosts get a bit boring, especially with people dying quite a lot as your sims lives and towns progress. Leave out the star signs and the aliens and rein in the ghosts and it's near a perfect 10. As it is, I give it 8/10.",1641509606,1641509606,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've been playing Sims 4 more than 3 lately, but I'm not really sure why. I love the gameplay mechanics, I love how personizable it is, with mods and custom content, but I also deeply enjoy the base and expansions as they are. I've got 200+ hours logged on steam, but the laptop from my teen years had a disk copy and at least 300 hours before the computer just kicked the bucket. I'm pretty sure their catchphrase or whatever is 'Play with life' and this game 100% delivers on that. It's fun and there's an almost endless amount of things to do. 
And a pro tip! I bought all my DLC during steam sales where it was all $5 each, and I really can't think of a better deal than that. hold out for those sales! If you enjoy Sims, it's worth it to drop $40 on 8 expansion/stuff/whatever packs.

What I like doing most in the game is just taking care of a simple family and seeing how far I can get a family tree to go. I've always loved doing this in The Sims and it is a very cool way to show playtime and progress. Firstly, I'd probably say that the Sims 3 in terms of content is the best in the series even years later I'm still finding stuff I didn't even know I was in the game.  Sims 3’s  open world structure is also very nice and it's something that I miss when I play The Sims 4.  The ui is laid out very nicely. It's very easy to figure out what your sim needs.  You can get lost in this game for hours Taking care of an imaginary family or doing whatever your heart desires. However I do have some gripes about the Sims 3 even though the positives well outweigh the negatives.  Even though this is the better game in some respects, The Sims 4 streamlines things Much better than the Sims 3. For example, one of the most useless periods for a sim  is when they are newborns. The Sims 4 remedies this by letting you age up a newborn straight to a toddler. The Sims 3 doesn't have this feature. again it's minor but it's very much appreciated.  Also this game is optimized horribly on  newer machines. I physically had to go into the files of the game to fix certain settings and change certain  variables so that the game runs better. I would also highly recommend against the island paradise DLC, as it runs horribly on any machine I tested it on.  Overall, even though I like The Sims  4 more,  The Sims 3 is an extremely close second and I highly recommend it on sale or not. also the expansion packs in this game have a lot more in them than the Sims 4 in my opinion so if you can get any of the expansion packs on sale I'd definitely pick up a few. 97/100",1484574815,1641251264,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've had the Origin version of the game since 2013 because before that I was playing on console, and from 2015 onwards the game has been virtually impossible to run since the release of patch 1.69; I've had performance issues, compatibility issues and it has generally just been a hassle to play, so my playtime has dropped drastically.

I was looking at the Steam sale and noticed that the Sims 3 collection was on sale and so was the basegame, so I spent my remaining Christmas money on it and I can't explain how much easier it has been to play. The game is so much more stable even though I'm now running more DLC than I was before on Origin, and I have CC and Mods added in too. The FPS is stable, I can have my graphics up high again, and I haven't enjoyed the game this much since patch 1.69 came out, honestly.

If you want to play Sims buy 4 over this or play Sims free for your phone (even though there are a few reviews saying Sims 3 is better than 4). After playing this game for over 7 hrs the main town I was playing in keeps locking up. It seems to happen during the night when Sims are sleeping no matter what I try from running in different compatibility modes in Windows, to changing the game speed, deleting the cache files, changing the default memory the game uses (in the config files of the game), doing a reinstall, nothing works. If I had to do it again I would not buy this game. Do yourself a favor save your money and stay away from this. Steam should be ashamed to sell this game on their store.

The open world, the Create A Style tool, the townie's story progression, all are leaps and bounds over both Sims 2 and 4 in what it adds to the gameplay experience. This game brought so much to the table that it to this day holds up as the standard Life Simulation game. 

The game, however, isn't without its faults. My biggest qualm with this game is the numerous technical issues that come with running a 12 year old game running on modern hardware. Simply put, it hasn't aged well. While there are a plethora of community-made fixes / game patches that claim to solve these issues, such as the nRaas mods and LazyDuchess' recently released Smooth Patch, not even these two combined along are enough to make Sims 3 run as smoothly as desired. Regardless, you shouldn't have to install a whole bunch of fan made patches just to PLAY the damn thing. Maxis was being somewhat truthful when they said that the game's open world and create a style tools were taken away in Sims 4 to allow for better performance, but I still can't help but feel like a lot of the problems faced while playing come as a result of a lack of future-proofing on their part.

If you're willing to look past the unoptimization and bugs, though, you'll find what is truly a worthwhile gaming experience that few other life sim games have ever or will ever achieve, and that is what earns this game a positive review.",1640479494,1640632991,True,0,2,0,0,True,False,False

I really love that my characters can age up and I can decide how fast or slow I want them to get older. I love how many different lots there are, and how I can customize each house I build but that there are also pre-built rooms you can add to your house. I think the most time I spend in the game is designing homes for my Sims. 

The expansions have some great content but definitely aren't worth the full price. I had 3 expansions/stuff packs already and just got the rest of them (16) in a bundle for only $56 during the winter sale!! I think I may get a little overwhelmed exploring 16 expansions all at once, but I'm excited to try new careers and get all the new items! The late night expansion is really neat, it adds a city where your sim can live in an apartment building and go to night clubs, or become a vampire if you want. I've been making a new family for each expansion I buy, in order to fully experience each one. The world traveler one is really cool because it allows you to travel to 3 different countries and explore tombs, meet locals, and add new skills (such as martial arts in China). 

The only real negative for me is some of the customization when making your Sim. Most of the hairstyles are terrible, and there aren't always great options for clothing and other features. You do get some new clothing options from each expansion, so that helps a lot. In a previous version of the sims (maybe the Sims 2, I can't remember), you could have your sim go shopping in town and buy new outfits. I wish that were an option in this version, it would be nice to have options in my sims' wardrobe. One thing I like about it though is that you can customize a different outfit for different activities: everyday, swimwear, outerwear, sleepwear, and formal wear.

-Open World design, no loading screens.
-More options and functions, a more complex game that can be difficult but rewarding for those who are willing to get familiar with the deep and intricate systems in it
-Evil characters are more fun to play with here (taking ""evil"" showers, take evil slumber)
-Job performance was more difficult but you had more control over it due to the conditions being more clear.
-The game gives you more reason to make friends, with your job and personal life benefiting from being social
-The game feels more alive, with characters that are not in your control being able to have kids, fall in love with other sims, and have jobs of their own. Sims 4 felt too constrained to your own household

Why Sims 4 over Sims 3:
-Better UI
-MUCH more simpler for newcomers to the series, smaller learning curve
-Better graphics
-WAAAAY better optimization. Sims 4 runs better than the Sims 3 on my PC,
-Recognizes GPUs after 2013 without the use of mods
-The mood mechanic is actually pretty cool
-Smaller neighbourhoods/towns means that it's easier for people who enjoy playing multiple families within the same save file

TL;DR: Play Sims 4 if you're new to the series to get a grasp of the game and it's mechanics. Play Sims 3 if you're like me and got bored of Sims 4 after easily mastering said mechanics and prefer more complex systems with higher difficulty",1640403532,1640403532,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Also a lot of good mods. You can almost enjoy it like modded Skyrim if You catch my drift.

Get it all during the sales, 100% worth it.

The biggest, most important thing that is present in Sims 3 is ability to customize textures for anything You place in Your house which ensures that You can maintain the same style and similar textures as everything else.

Another thing is that Sims 3 is more like an open world game with rather large worlds that You can move around on foot or in car that You can buy.

torture.....its basically a abusive parent roleplay
unlike sims 4 playing the game isnt fucking boring and i can actually do shit like go to a store or drive a fucking car
the building mechanism actually works too and i can actually build instead of just making a few walls then giving up
and just getting something from the gallery because the mechanism is so broken in sims 4
the last comparation i will make to sims 4 is that if you buy the cats and dogs pack you can actually PLAY THE FUCKING ANIMAL , WHY WOULD I WANT A SIMS DLC WITH ANIMALS WITHOUT HAVING THE ABILITY TO PLAY A CAT? the DLCs
in general are wayyyyy more entertaining and free spirited then i sims 4 even thought theyre cheaper
the game is kinda glichy but i can overlook that + creating sims in this game is wayyy more fun then in sims 4 because you dont
have to spend ages trying to make lips look like lips

conclusion? this game is fun and actually funcions like a simulator, is pretty damn cheap, tiny details are very cool 
and is better then sims 4 (AE FIX YOUR GAME)

PROS
-Most expansive, customized building mode of the entire series
-Fun DLCs that can add value to your experience (Want to be a vampire? Own a unicorn? You can do all of these things and more with the right DLC)
-Plenty of quirky Sim interactions that keep the game fresh and enjoyable

CONS
-The game can absolutely lag, especially if you install multiple DLCs
-The choices for textured hair are really lacking in the Create a Sim feature
-Prices for DLCs are a bit high for a game as old as this one (I would wait for a sale)

In addition to the main Sims 3 game, I've played the following DLCs: Supernatural, Pets, Seasons, Generations, World Adventures, and Ambitions. For those whose game tends to lag a lot, I recommend Pets, Seasons, and Generations. You can still have lots of fun with those DLCs added to the base game. My favorite DLC, though, is absolutely Supernatural; it adds so much to the overall experience and gameplay that I can't praise it enough. I'm fairly ambivalent about Ambitions, which lets you choose a career and actually make decisions/move while working. Some of the options for careers are entertaining, like ghost-hunting, but I mostly found this DLC to be glitchy (could just be issues on my end, though).

All in all, Sims 3 is a great game and one of the stronger editions of the Sims franchise.",1614392874,1639447322,True,2,0,0.523607730865478516,0,True,False,False

fortunately, the community has the solution. able to fix a few error and details
unfortunately, EA , Devs or whoever is now hold the franchise.  seem to not  bothered to give an updates for their older game product.

i recommended to play sims 3 for proper experience if your new to the series.
if you have the dedication to fixing & reprogram the game to ensure it work properly.

if not good at fixing, just go for the sims 4 for good quality & system , but your going to miss a few features that sims 3 offer but sims 4 dint.

- During its entire lifetime, outside of MacOS, the game has never been updated to 64-bit.

However, in my case, using performance-improving mods (from NRass) breaks the game even further without showing any sign of performance improvement.
- The loading and saving times get ridiculously longer for every savegame over time and the performance standard has become so low that many players think 15 minutes to load a save is fast and 30 minutes (even without any custom content) is acceptable.
- Launcher still runs in the background after starting the game, using more hardware resources than needed.

Well fine.  Yes, this is a good game, even if the full experience costs the GDP of a small country. 

Most importantly, it has been on Steam since before Origin was around, so it doesn't require any sort of EA account nor Origin to play (though it is still recommended that you bypass the launcher). 

It is an absolutely wonderful torture simulator. The perfect game for making innocent people lead horrible lives, leading eventually to horrible and amusing deaths. 
There are also tons of adult mods for it, so it can double as a porn-game... and plenty of torture / murder mods too.  Well, and just quality-of-life mods, but those are an afterthought. 


Downsides include insane loading times and instability (both of which get worse as the game progresses and more things have to be committed to memory),  the cost, the way the characters sound overwhelmingly American even when speaking complete nonsense, and the inability to kill small children. 
I'm sure at least some of those can be fixed with mods. Maybe I should look to see if there is an accent-changer mod... but I doubt it.   There probably is one for putting babies in blenders though, so I should be able to recreate Mai-Chan's Daily Life.",1637170043,1637170106,True,4,0,0.538020968437194824,0,True,False,False

The only downside is it is buggy and can be laggy, nothing game breaking at least that I've come across so far, but until I added game-fixing mods and  added more memory it had crashed to the desktop a few times but only intermittently which was an annoyance but normally  not an issue as long as I remembered to save after any major progress & often I could play for hours before it happened.

For  me I enjoy the game enough its worth putting up with the flaws and (until I added more memory) odd rude desktop interruption. If you do get it I'd recommend installing the nraas mods Overwatch, ErrorTrap & traveler (although the latter perhaps only if you're going to move your sims to a new neighbourhood, send them on holiday, to uni etc) as they help catch and repair errors & replace the at times broken travel system as the issues occur. With Errortrap make sure you get the steam version not origin though as unlike all the other nraas mods it matters and the origin version is not compatible with the Steam version.

With DLCs that he used to make us use the game was an excellent learning tool Seasons DLC,the DLC that added special needs people and pets DLC And with a bit of adult supervision and adult guidance He turned it into an excellent learning tool Mind you he had all the other DLC he could find as well but those were the main ones he made us use so if anyone knows where I can find the missing DLC tell me what connects or post a comment please Or even what the DLC was actually called because it added a lot more than just special needs people it added a lot of other features as well making the game much more realistic It even added some rather nice Jobs and the ability to build workplaces on vacant Lots And not just homes I almost want to give this game a thumbs down because of this missing DLC however I like this game so much I can't bring myself to give thumbs down.

What I like:
+Open world. You can explore the world at any time anywhere which is really cool and this is exactly what Sims 4 is lacking the most. 
+Deep costumization like never before
+The DLCs are million times better than Sims 4 could only ever dreams of

What I dislike:

-Very unoptomized and low FPS. Unfortunately the only issue that frustrates me is the not-so-optimization. The game would lag constantly when you explore the world and this issue exists for newer graphics cards.
-Lack of world maps and variety with most DLCs 
-Maps are locked behind online DRM. It would've been fine if they added map pack or stuff pack from sims store web on steam I'll happily pay 50 dollars just for that.
-Atrocious load times and especially the god awful long ass unskippable intro videos
-Doesn't properly save and doesn't use Steam's cloud save service
-Does not play well on laptop, it gets hot very quickly

It's a fun game that aids itself to playing in bursts. Make a new file, create the perfect life, and move on. It's fun for short bursts like that, but I'd not play it often.

I can recommend this game to most people, but it'd not really be worth much. I don't think you'd get enough out of it to justify the kind of price-tag it had upon release. I do however, think it's worth the 20 euros it cost now (just don't buy the DLC).",1633712478,1633712478,True,1,0,0.511836707592010498,1,True,False,False

You can live out your life digitally that you really wanted. There is plenty to explore and do in the Sims 3.

The Sims 3 has many additions  to the game
UNIVERSITY - Go to University excel and get good grades...or just go to party's and get drunk
SUPERNATURAL - Supernatural is focused on bringing new life states to the game, and establishes an appropriate setting for these creatures to live in one town with Moonlight Falls. This guide will cover the largest  additions for owners of this Expansion Pack.
AMBITIONS - Ambitions is the best expansion pack for Simmers who like to make money. This is a great add on as it brings five new professions, one changed one, and several other ways to make money. The highlights of the  the professions. Sims can be a ghost hunter, firefighter, stylist, architect, or private investigator. These pay a weekly stipend and give you money per job.
PETS - If you don't like pets, you won't like this Expansion. Its primary contributions are Cats, Dogs, and Horses. Cats and Dogs 
And many many add on and downloadable content

I played this game when it was first released during my high school years long before Steam. While every one of my friends played Battlefield or Call of Duty, I played this almost every chance I got. But this review is going to be about comparing Sims 3 with Sims 4. Both good and bad points of each game, something I wanted to do for so long.

[b]TLDR part at the bottom![/b]

[h1] Review Score:  8/10[/h1] 

[u] Sims 3: [/u]
[list]
    [*] (+) Tons of meaningful and fun content to explore. With open-world, there are tons of things for your sims to do. You could spend hours upon hours playing on one sim or a whole family. I know I spent my entire high school life here. Be warned, you can get incredibly addicted for days, weeks, months, or even years like I did.

    [*] (+) Music and sound design is fantastic. Tons of parody of real life songs but in Simlish(Sim's gibberish language) and there is a ton of heart into each sim's interaction with the world. I still have the entire soundtrack on my phone to listen to whenever I feel like it. I even heard sims 3 music in an unrelated documentary and advertisement. It's that good!

    [*] (=) The expansion content is fantastic with tons of content with meaningful changes to the world and how you play with it. Seasons and Pets is my all-time favorites, but I still enjoyed World Adventures and Generations. All of the expansions I highly recommend to get if you looking for more content. But... the stuff packs are really just bland... They are literally ""free update"" level in quality & quantity. One of their DLCs is outright unplayable garbage, take a wild guess which one that is(check the reviews)... They never bothered to fix it, have to find a janky workaround for it. OH! It's also ridiculously OVERPRICED! The game is 12 years old now, why the fuck is it still $20+? Get on sale only!

    [*] (-) This game runs like a beat up engine of an old used car. The optimization was abysmal back then and even now. It is very difficult to play this game without technical mods to improve the stability and the overall performance. Load times can be very long and almost astronomically long if you have many mods installed. I remember I had a decent amount of mods installed to improve the game and it took like 20 - 30 minutes of loading(once).

    [*] (-) The art design did not age very well. Even when this game came out in 2009 the models, textures, and effects were ugly. It definitely did it no favors in the current time, even with graphic mods. Ridiculed then and now... There is limit to how much you can polish something this hideous. 

[/list]

[u] Sims 4: [/u]
[list]
    [*] (+) The better QoL improvements to build mode, create-a-sim mode, and live mode makes doing creative content a lot easier to handle especially for beginners. I made tons of unique houses and sims to the point where I got curated by the Maxis developers at one point. It's hard to explain every positive change, but I won't lie... I had a hard time going back to Sims 3 build mode. Although, their CAS mode could use a slider system and Create-a-Style feature. You can live without them, but it does hamper on potential creativity. The ability to have Sims multi-task multiple duties makes the game play far less rigid and more natural than ever before.

    [*] (+) Very well optimized, you can pretty much on any computer system including crappy laptops. I know I played a bit when I was overseas and had nothing to play. The constant short loading times can be annoying, but you can largely ignore them. You can actually play this game without any mods installed. I recommend a few gameplay-enhancing ones to give the game more depth that it lacks.

    [*] (=) The introduction to the Gallery makes it easier for people to find custom houses, sims, or rooms to download for them to use in their own world. It was always fun to see what actual creative people can make... minus all of those [Teen Pregnancy or Jersey Shore or Monster-mash sims that has plagued the platform for years... shudders...]. Because it lets ANYONE upload their creation, there is little to no quality control. All the great content can be buried under tons of awful ones. But when you find that one great one, it makes you really appreciate the community.

    [*] (-) Lack of free-roam of any kind past neighborhoods. This is major downside and what made TONS of players leave the series all-together. Sure the loading times are faster, but there are tons of them in-between everything you do outside your house. It completely disconnects you from your sims and the world... It's the part I absolutely hated. The neighborhood version they replaced with is okay in certain areas like City Life, but TERRIBLY lacking in other worlds. A complete waste of potential here.

    [*] (-) FAR weaker DLCs than their Sims 3 counterparts. Sims 4 Cats & Dogs is a joke compare to Pets, Sims 4 Seasons is okay... but less impact with the lack of free-roam, several expansions are split into stuff packs & game packs to milk the living crap out their fanbase's wallets. Then they decide to release ""Kits"" which are even more of an insult to injury. Remember when they made a DLC for a DLC? Yeah it's that bad... This game is notorious for having terrible DLC practice and it's only gotten worse. Majority of them are overpriced trash when compared to their predecessors(Sims 1 - 3).

[/list]

[h1]TLDR: [/h1]

Sims 3 is a giant diamond in the rough. It has tons of value, but incredibly rough around the edges. You have to do your own kind of polishing here.

Sims 4 is a tiny diamond but polished to a certain degree. Has much less meaningful content than its predecessors(Sims 1 - 3), but at least I can actually play it without much problems.

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]

I can spend hours here listing all the pros and cons of each game. Both games have their own strengths and design philosophy, but when you take off the nostalgia goggles... Sims 3 is not as ""perfect"" some would make it out to be. The final verdict is that Sims 3 simply just a ""better"" thought out game made by a bunch of developers who loved the game and wanted to push the boundaries of the Life Simulator genre. Sims 3 is a great sequel to the Sims franchise. Sims 4 is a decent sequel to Sims 2, but a bad sequel to Sims 3.

In conclusion? It's okay to enjoy both titles, but I understand why people love this game more than the latest iteration. This was a time when EA didn't completely suck, when they weren't the one of the worst game companies to ever exist. You know games like Dragon Age Origins, Sims 3, FIFA 10, Battlefield Bad Company, Dead Space, and etc. Now look at where all of these franchises become...",1633405015,1633405162,True,13,0,0.641681194305419922,0,True,False,False

Aside from total lack of optimization on modern systems, and stuck on 32bit compared to the macs new 64bit version. The Game certainly chugs, but it's a product of time. But despite all that, it's still the definitive version of the sims for me. Sure sims 4 is new, but it sacrifices a lot of the charm the older sims had in order to be what it is. 

Of course, the sims 3 is best played with the expansion packs, but be prepared to spend hundreds of dollars just to get a game that'll sooner spit in your face rather than run smoothly. Even with mods to help the game run, the longer you play a save file, the more likely it is that you'll eventually have to start a new game just because of the massive amount of slowdown that happens.

But that still hasn't stopped me from enjoying it for all these years.",1344056938,1632864797,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

~I'll never forget not saving after promotions or a few hours and having a satellite fall from the sky and destroy my young & just starting out on her own sim.
~I was on the phone with a friend trying to finish up French homework (because no one could afford 10 cents a text back in the early 2000's) and their sim started a fire and had the alarm going off, meanwhile my sim started and fire and their alarm starts going off. They tragically did not make it, but the french homework got completed. C'est la vie n'est pas?
~ Move objects on cheat and moving a shower while a sim was in it scared me the first time - are they NEKKED?! - well yes but no but yes. I sometimes now put ""never nude"" as a personality trait as a cheeky reminder of my innocent shock.
~ The most memorable and embarrassing Sims related goof was when I had a birthday (in real life) and decided to try my sims favorite food (key lime pie). I never had key lime pie... and my first taste was tragically awful. My friends asked why I had never tried it before making it my birthday ""cake/pie"" and my response was ""well my sim loves it"". I still get sass for that.

These games helped define me growing up - they were an easy ice breaker when I didn't know what to talk about and they helped relieve stress when I would make my least favorite person in the game and make their lives miserable... I always turned into a sap and got them an okay lifestyle even if the real life version of them was a complete doo-doo head.

Conclusion:

Ok, so there are some good and bad things about this game. First, the good. This game is pretty fun, has so much to do, and overall has a fairly polished feel to it. But, as for the bad, pretty much everything is blocked behind a paywall (a really expensive one, at that). The base game (with the Pets expansion pack) is all I feel that is REALLY necessary.",1630248553,1630248553,True,1,1,0.498489409685134888,0,True,False,False

I mean they constantly ask you for money now and the bar at the bottom with needs, relationships, etc, has changed slightly. 

In the 1 hr I played this I saved multiple times. Each time it said ""Error 12: Cannot save"". After 58 minutes. It crashed. I lost my file; not that I could save it if I wanted too. Started it up again and got another error; it wouldn't even open. Tried again and this time it opened and I THINK it might have actually saved. 3rd time's the charm.

Honestly, besides being able to add individual traits I didn't see any improvement from Sims 2. If anything it's worse.

Update: I've now played more hrs so, if you wait to pay your bills it will send you a warning that if you don't pay them now a repoman will come and take your things. It doesn't matter tho because if you wait that long the repoman comes anyways whether you pay your bills after the warning or not. There's no stopping it. The game will also freeze up saving every 2 saves or so and you can only shut it down with task manager. Still not worth it.",1541057810,1630216500,False,7,4,0.502258062362670898,0,True,False,False

Great customisation thanks to lots of traits that make Sims feel unique, and that are implemented in-depth to the point where there's more in the Sims 3 base game than all packs in the Sims 4. All Sims feel unique and I get attached to most, once I nearly cried because my Sim's girlfriend died and he mourned her for days. I also love the option to change the lifespans, as for some stories I want them to last for a long time while others work better with the traditional lifespan. Also Create-A-Style is amazing, even though I don't use it in-depth, I like colour-coding which bed belongs to which Sim, especially in large households. This means that they can all have matching beds which I much prefer over having to get different beds to suit the swatches I need in sometimes 2 & especially 4. 

I also love the open-world as it allows an ease of exploration & story-telling without the loading screens of any other Sims game. Also like the art style. The environment is the best out of all Sims games (fight me). There is also some lore in the world which you can explore, which I enjoy but personally think they went more in-depth and did a better job with Sims 2.

The only drawbacks are that the design of the hair & clothes are bad which is what makes people think that the art style is bad, and that you can't have the option to play rotationally without mods, which I would prefer for some stories. But I forget about these easily as I cater my stories to the vanilla single-household play style of the Sims 3 (for now), and you forget about the looks quickly by being immersed by the game play.
 
Some people also have performance issues which they can't get over, I used to have a potato and in my personal opinion the game barely lagged with the lowest settings with most of the expansions enabled. Now though with a better laptop my gave runs smoothly.

Overall: 9/10. A must-have for Simmers, especially those who can't play 2. Can stand on its own but the rating gets amplified by the expansions, which although are expensive for how old they are they still have 1000x better quality than the current expansions we get today.",1630130186,1630130186,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Your sims will woohoo with grandmas, cheat spouses out of their money and kick them out of their own houses, lock other sims in basements and leave them to starve and pee themselves to death, flirt with the grim reaper, steal people's curtains, get fired from jobs, find creepy gnomes in the garden, randomly start rooting through a dumpster instead of sitting and eating with their date, and so much more.

But if you're like me, where time is a construct--man-made BS to keep you a slave to the clock and always thinking you're wasting it but you stopped giving a f---, by all means. Waste it living the dream in the Sims. 
I actively avoid this game. But sometimes it's nice to be sucked back into this little fantasy world. A shame this one never came to console because it is arguably the best one. Better than 4 imo.
Sometimes this game and DLC are on sale. I've seen it for like 10 bucks (Maybe lower, not sure) Avoid full price if possible.

The core components are basically the same with each sims version. Aging and other effects create a slightly different dynamic. Would I buy Sims 4? Only if it came in a bundle sale on steam and had smaller game save files. Do I have fun with it? Sure, but then I can have fun with a lot of simpler games. It's cheap to get if you grab the bundle on holidays and hours of play if you like Storytelling. Yes, its basically playing with a digital dollhouse or ""action figures."" Then again, most games are in the most basic sense the same concept of make believe and playing hero or bad guy.

Sims 3 does have a number of bugs that have never been addressed even now. Sims 4 is reportedly less game breaking. NRAAS has appeared to solve a lot of issues with Sims 3 as a community developed fix. As I understand it, it's a script that cleans up things in the game each day. re-routing stuck characters, removing extras, turning off televisions, etc. 
It's not bad though it is a broken game if you play it long enough without the community fixes. With the fixes it trudges along and on sale days it's cheaper than sims 4.",1412751479,1627354550,True,4,0,0.503951072692871094,0,True,False,False

The trait based gameplay greatly expanded on the older games in the franchise, and is a change I greatly appreciate. Instead of personality points from older games, now if you want your sim to be a say, kleptomaniac, you can do that. Everyone now feels more connected to each other thanks to the open neighbourhood. The existence of create a style is a nice addition I’ll miss from The Sims 4, as I often used it to get matching clothes or furniture.

Unfortunately, the game often suffers from stutters and lag because the game is always trying to keep track of what every sim in the neighbourhood is doing at once. Public lots often take a long time to populate thanks to everyone’s scattered schedules, even when the club your sim is at is supposedly a hotspot. Another issue is the lack of proper art direction which is a big deal in a series based around decorating, building, and dressing your sims. The textures used for clothes can be waxy and the assets often seem like they don’t belong to the same game. This isn’t a personal problem for me, but should be taken into account by more avid builders or decorators.

Although The Sims 3 has its problems, I enjoyed playing it overall, even without the purchase of any DLCs. If you’re a more family focused player, I recommend this to try out before The Sims 4.",1626863577,1626863577,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
