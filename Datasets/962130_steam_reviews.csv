The game also has massive clipping issues which means you lose half of your arrows and spears due to them glitching into the terrain which is why you should never upgrade spears. Unfortunately spears and bows are among my favourite weapon types. Too bad.

Other than that is a fun game which unfortunately has too many cheese mechanics like wasps that aoe outheal your damage (yes they heal their whole group) or buffgear being made ineffective because you enter combat since the devs don´t like you to have a speed advantage so they artificially slow you down ect.

You have to collect golden cards that supposedly have a 1% droprate by killing the various enemies from the game. This includes the extra bosses. 

That droprate is a lie by the developers. There are numerous topics of people having to kill over 600 bugs to get a card to drop. My own experience hasn't been any better.  On top of that there are certain enemies like the ""Termite King"" (feel free to look it up) that only respawn once every 3 days. Now the game has a raid mechanic to ""offset"" this problem, by allowing you to summon certain enemies for parts they drop. The termite king doesn't drop enough parts from a single kill to summon the appropriate raid though and to make it worse; the raid has a 50% chance of just being a bunch of regular enemies. It's the same for enemies like the wasp drone, you can summon a whole bunch of wasps and have to hope against hope that maybe... just maybe one of them is a drone and not a regular wasp. (usually 1 in 10-15 wasps ends up being a drone) 

Then there's a boss that was added in a recent patch (the infected Broodmother, 5% supposed dropchance) that requires the parts of other bosses from the game to summon it. Be ready to grind those bosses to have more attempts at farming this boss, or grind quests to get science points to duplicate the bait used to summon the boss. But no matter the option, you're gonna be grinding.

All the other progress in the game up until the endgame was story-based or just plain logical follow-up unlocks. But the entire endgame is just RNG on top of more RNG. 

The final insult is that anyone who played the game before these patches got the 100% achievement without having to do any of this. Getting the gold cards didn't used to be a requirement. Soon they'll release patch 1.4 for the game which will introduce another additional boss increasing the grind even further.

It's the laziest way possible to extend the gameplay time, don't support these developers.",1708878366,1708878366,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Pros:
- A pretty solid building system that lets you explore extensive hours of building were not only you will be motivated to build something that looks awesome but also something practical due to the raids.
-The combat is really fun and there is a bunch of variety of builds and weapons, its simple but it just works
-Lots and Lots of traits to explore and make a build
-Super appealing cosmetics, armors and weapons
-Enthralling story and amazing mob design
-Exceptional Bosses
-Fun movement with the ziplines
-The theme has to be one of the coolest things ever for those of you growing up with Ants Life, Ant Boy and Honey i shrinked the kids

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Cons:
-there should be more creative ways to get by like domesticating some of the bigger insects like a rideable ant or a rideable bee
-the lack of some units make the environment feel a bit incomplete like the ant queen not existing.
-the lack of a beehive, a walkable beehive dungeon would be awesome
-the house being accessible 
-the lack of character creation, sadly even doe I like the characters present I would love to have at least an option to instead use a created character with my own customization
-4 player only lobbies, I feel most survival games with this much content allow players to playy with lots of friends which is one of the biggest appeals in the survival game genre and such a restricting lobby created situations were the odd friend out most often stopped playing altogether.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This said most of my cons are stuff I feel they are planning on adding later on with the exception of char creation, which i feel if we at least had customization for the existing chars it would already go a long way or at least more kids to choose from

There's a wide array of bugs you can encounter and a whole backyard that feels like an entire country at your tiny size. The game is very flexible in how you can play to suit your level and style of gameplay, as well as a nice arachnophobia mode that you can adjust to make the spiders less terrifying. 
The only problem that I see with this game is when you try to play in multiplayer mode. There are times when the game will run slower, or flat out not allow you to join a friend's game. Other times it takes multiple tries to finally join, and it can vary from player to player. Some friends can join with little to no issue while others simply can't no matter what they try. It can be very frustrating, so take that with a bit of caution. When it DOES work, the game is a lot more fun when you have others to share the work load and combat aggro.

The CONS: 

- The UI and dying -
We're playing on Medium, so when you die you lose your backpack, and thats fine. But the fact that you have to reorganize your backpack is a little annoying.

- Raids -
These just suck after a while. Raids would be fine if the bugs didnt totally destroy everything you worked so hard to build. Dont get me wrong, I LOVE the combat, fighting and grinding in this game. But to see your base that you've been working weeks on just get destroyed in about 5minutes give-or-take is really heartbreaking.

We are a family of four that usually play all together.
We played from day one and there are so many improvements made its pure awesome!

Pros:
-Combat. You need to check enemies' weaknesses, resistances and block just in time. Simple, but satisfying.
-Exploration is rewarding. Some docs about lore and story of the game, skill points, new items, new UI flavors, new craft ingredients, new interesting locations. It's really great here.
-OST. It's great, but gets repetetive after a long time. There's basically one track per biome.
-Story. It's simple and isn't a focus of the game, but I quite liked. It goes for 80's vibe, which is pretty interesing, also characters(few of them) are pretty memorable. Main villain is basically a walking meme and I like it.
-Action-RPG side. You have lots of buffs/debuffs, special abilities from items/equipment/""potions""/food. Also the game has mutations(basically skills) which allow for a good variety of builds and some of them are pretty interesting. 
-Artstyle. It's cartoonish and pretty, yeah. Also sometimes quite creepy(spiders and undershed, brrrrr...). I love it, artists did a very good job here.
-Building. To be honest I didn't build castles here, so I can't say anything about building on that scale. We just had a 3-floor house with ""tower"" on the roof. All I can say, it was fun and wasn't a pain in the ass to engage with. Also there are a lot of furniture options and they all have an interesting design. Koi Scale chair is literally a Koi Scale chair, yeap. Also I really like the idea of ziplines, because they make traversing the map ease, if you are ready to put an effort into it and build them. We did exactly this and it was actually fun.
QOL. Crafring from the storage and hot deposit(no more spending 5 minutes on sorting all the garbage you collected). 
Cons:
-Party members and NPC characters have some phrases, that they say from time to time, which is cool, but the problem is, that there are only few of them. It just gets repetetive after some time.
-I was stuck in endless falling mode several times. I escaped eventually, but it's not good nevertheless.
-AI sometimes doesn't know what to do and it shows.
-Minor performance issues in several places.

9.5/10, buy for the full price, it's worth it.

Grounded makes it easy, because it has by far the most amount of QoL in any survival crafting game I've played (out of about 20). Crafting is easy because of craft from storage, banking is easy because of global hot deposit, inventory space is adequate, and with a little bit of work, traversing the map is easy too with ziplines.

It also has by far the best story out of all survival games I've played, though that's not saying much as they typically have little to no story. But it's pretty good in this one, regardless of genre. Combat also feels good, but punishing as there is no dodge roll, just blocking and parrying.

So as long as you're willing to change world options you'll enjoy the game. But probably not until you're halfway through the story if you're following it and not jumping to certain places to get the best gear early. If you do that you'll probably get bored easily by it because it'll be too easy. Maybe on ""Woah?"" 

Update: Tried the game again recently since they've added a lot to it. I changed some world settings so it wouldn't be such a dreadful grind solo. 
About 19 hours in I got jumped by a large spider while I was killing a stinkbug. I spawned into my base to find another large spider inside of it. Bugs will also randomly stop doing their walking animation, so they glide around like plastic toys. They added this neat Gnat to make solo base building less of a chore, but instead of making it a part of the game it's hidden off inside the world settings. There's actually some semblance of a story and progression now.

It's still in Early Access. Don't let them fool you. It's a shame too, it's a very cool concept.

Another Update. I logged back in and the spider was gone so I've been able to actually progress through the game somewhat. A lot of places don't have any bugs, some of them are places you'd expect to find a bug IRL. Like under a picnic table, there's pretty much zero bugs under it outside of an occasionally ant. Spiders wander the yard ignoring every single other bug, I've only seen them fight other aggressive bugs that probably started the fight. But as soon as you run past they're awake and on you with a jump.
The sad part is that the game isn't hard. It's just tedious. Once you unlock the flavored weapons the combat gets extremely stale. You can stay alive simply with a mosquito sword and some damage resistance. I was swarmed by at least 10 termites, but I kept spamming my mosquito sword stab, and it heals you based on all the damage it deals. So if it hits 5 termites, you get the heal from all 5 hits. Making you a nearly unkillable god against bugs that swarm. You also get a mace that makes shelled bugs a joke and a fire sword that makes spiders a joke.
The majority of the armor and weapons are useless though. And you're pigeonholed into using an entire 3 piece set for it's bonus. Making a lot of the fun pieces of gear without a full set feeling like a waste to wear. The majority of the trinkets are garbage too.

The game seems to want to do everything in it's power to be as annoying and tedious as possible.

So I turned off most of the annoying stuff and it's a lot better of a game when you play it like a regular RPG, similar to older Zelda games.",1651279869,1708133500,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Most of those issues are Microsoft related, so I think it's only fair to review the game itself, assuming you're able to play it without multiplayer issues.

With that being said, the game is great.  Very polished and enjoyable survival crafting experience, with co-op that mostly works.

Even when it only had that, this game was amazing, and I love everything they added to the game since then. 

All the different items they added to make the base look better is amazing, and you can pretty much make your base unique each time. I also love fighting the bosses, each one is difficult and unique. And the boss fights in the story line is amazing, my favorite boss fights are unfortunately the ones you only get to fight once in the game, being the Assistant Manager and the Mant boss fight. I do also like fighting the Orchid Mantis too though. Each insect is unique and amazing. I like all the armors. I like how messy the backyard is XD. I love all the ""biomes"" of the backyard as well.

The only problem I see some people complain about is that a lot of the insects in the upper yard are just reskined lower yard insects, but more aggressive. But honestly, I am glad they did this because its nice to see the same insect again, but different variations of them, because in real life there are many variations of certain insects too, like the ant. 

Overall, I'd rate this game a 10/10, and I wish games like this became more popularized because I love this genre, and I feel like it doesn't get as much love as it deserves.

Combat is mostly just smacking bugs with a specific tool, but there are light RPG elements allowing you to play ranged, melee or tank. You're really buying this game for the world though.

The backyard is an awesome worldspace and the level designers have added lots of interesting details, collectables and upgrades everywhere. Really fun to explore.

The base-building system is awesome. We built a starter base out of grass and weed stems and then moved onto a big castle made out of mushroom bricks, and we connected both bases with a zipline. Big fan of the armour stands! This game has the best, most intuitive UI system I have ever played with.

Pros:
- Enjoyable concept. I personally love base building and survival games and being mini-size brings it its own fun little twist.
- Creative ways using the resources around you
- The story is pretty interesting but you can still enjoy the game without paying much attention to the lore
- You can explore different biomes and connect your bases with a fun zip-line
- The cons don´t take the enjoyment out of the game. It´s still fun and definitely playable. 

Cons:
- You have to make a Microsoft account to play in multiplayer
- There are still a few bugs and desync problems overall.
- built things might not appear built to some players and you can fall through a floor
- some dew drops do not either load or fall from the grass,
- the stairs don´t appear where they should when you have built them (especially corner stairs)

Whenever someone comes up with a non-intended strategy for the hardest boss in the game, the devs will nerf it in a blink of an eye. It almost feels like they are constantly sniping on reddit/youtube/twitch, which is kind of disgusting. Most of the strategies don't even utilize any kind of glitches.

Because of this and only because of this reason, the devs constantly nerf low tier builds into completely trash. Yes you read it right, they nerf the already low tier builds. Just because these low tier builds have a very specific usage in that boss fight. Those builds were only okayish outside of the boss fight, which some people may still enjoy, but the devs still made them completely unplayable. Yes it's that one reason again which makes studios go down hill: When devs desperately trying to teach their players to play their game.

The only way they want us to beat that boss is to go Sekiro style: perfect parrying every attack. They don't want us to be creative and make our own builds, despite (seemingly) having so many options. Apparently they don't know what kind of game they are making. They made their game with 0 diversity in terms of the last boss fight.

I DO have a cheese for the last boss and nobody on the internet talks about it. But unfortunately I don't want to share it publicly. It's the only game I have ever played that I don't want to share exciting new findings, I am super sorry. It's a PvE survival craft game, you are supposed to be able to do what ever the f you want. Look at Palworld, their official account even retweet players cheesing a mid-end game boss. Go play that game instead.",1684917368,1707599109,False,4,0,0.463075309991836548,0,True,False,False

finishing this game 100% is a pain in the ass. I would not recommend going for it as it involves a lot of RNG and luck just to finish a game.

No chance for single players, even with others can be the over-saturation issue, their is too much going on and that boils down to the games theme, rather than a poor execution of the story telling elements that may have been interesting if it wasnt a hard lock on need other players to survive with you. It just aint worth it for the game it currently is, might as well not even have a single player option considering how much different dynamics are going on.

You'd think the devs would make this game more forgiving for what appears (on the surface) to be a game for a younger audience. maybe it's just my reflexes but even some of the environments seems counter intuitive, yes I guess it must be a sandpit idea, but the ""cross pollination"" and co mingling of creatures was an over-saturation. I guess that's how it is with a miniature insect scaled game, perhaps the devs would have made more lasting response going in a different theme,, I mean I applaud the effort on a theme so diverse and intricate. However the systems I can see utilised in this game possibly would have suited a farming sim, or heck maybe even a single player survival ""prehistoric"" game or even the ""Castaway"" games like ""plane crash into island.  

The game is impressively detailed, with lots of interactivity with the environment! (except no land reshaping ""shovelling"" but is probably why this game runs soo well considering how much is going on in the game, it really did give that wow factor of how did they make this?)

I am NOT recommending this game, although it looks flash and appropriate. It fails to keep me coming back, its not even about worrying about having friends to play, the fact that you can die by one small spider on day one ironically is a scaling issue and balance between enemies, especially on the ""easiest mode"" for single player, their is probably soo much story and creatures to kill that could be fun, that it seems like it just a challenge at a theme that is heartbreaking. No matter how much I give this game a go in single player theres just too much going on, and then with other players its like so now I can kill more creatures all for what really exactly, a few tidbits and bits & bobs that would be a real pain to grind, player base down, not fun at all.",1673656787,1707252412,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For those who are interested in the min/maxing and meta gameplay, this game kinda forces you to play a variety within a melee/parry style, since the other combat forms comparatively lack DPS. Also, the bug's melee attacks are mostly ""targeting"" skills, so even if it doesn't hit your character's hitbox visibly, it will still damage. Thus, blocking/parrying becomes a necessity.

OK, now that's out of the way... [i]Grounded[/i] is an interesting take on the survival-sandbox genre.  Don't be fooled by the cheesy presentation, this game is brutal, especially when you're playing solo.  This isn't some PG kids' movie.  The Backyard is an incredibly dangerous place when you're the size of an ant; even the cute little ladybugs are roughly the size of a truck, and they hit like one too.  And then there are the spiders, it says something that the game has an ""arachnophobia"" setting to make them less scary.

I thought the design of the game was done very well. You've got most of the standard biomes -- forest, swamp, caves, desert, underwater, etc. -- re-imagined as giant-size versions of a typical backyard landscape, and the enemies are mostly the various critters that a normal-sized person would barely even notice.   Regarding difficulty, the game is for the most part challenging but not frustrating.  Advancing through the game means building new tools and weapons, but building them usually requires parts from tougher bugs that you need those weapons to defeat. E.g. a gas mask requires stinkbug parts, but you need a gas mask to fight the stinkbugs.  So there's a bit of a difficulty spike when you're ready to move up to the next tier, but it's not insurmountable.  (Pro-tip: sometimes you can find the parts you need in spider web sacs, so you only have to fight some tiny spiders instead of the big bugs.)

I thought the Mutation system was really cool. As you play through the game, you'll get Mutations that can alter your character in various ways, usually related to your playstyle.  Say, favor a sword-type weapon and get a bonus to swords, run around a lot and get better stamina, kill a lot of spiders and get poison resistance, etc.  You can have only a few active at a time, but they're hot-swappable with four presets. I found that it worked well setting up the presets for exploring, fighting, swimming, and building.

My biggest complaint is that the game is very obviously built with multiplayer in mind.  It's not really noticeable at the beginning, but later there are many sections that are extremely challenging for a solo player.  Nearly every boss is a summoner type, so you can be easily overwhelmed if you don't deal with the minions quickly.  And the final challenge is a hold-the-line fight where you have to defend three different points simultaneously.  It's possible (I did it) but not without a ton of preparation and probably several attempts, leading to a fair bit of ending-fatigue.  Even when I took the trouble to find and fight a different boss first, which was hinted to negate the need for that battle, it didn't.

In summary: a difficult but fun survival game that lasts just a little longer than it should, probably more fun if you have somebody to play it with.",1707101823,1707101823,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Survival crafting where you can go about as deep as you want with that or simply get the necessary upgrades to progress the story/mystery.

The setting is about as interesting/novel as Subnautica's is (although I still think Subnautica's is a tad better) and the mystery is a little more simple/obvious, but it's still got a similar style of progression, albeit with actual map markers most fo the time instead of clues you have to puzzle out yourself.

we blindly played the game with no guides and tips or whatsoever on the hardest difficulty with my family on a 3-4 man multiplayer. and we may have died alot but it was a great experience for sure, after trying different builds and battle strategies to overcome certain areas

we finished the game - got rank A rating in our world with a total playtime of +100hrs and probably +50hrs of grinding/building our bases)

the story is very nice since it gave us an objective on what to do but i was hoping they could make it longer or do more contents cus we got the late game items but we are almost finished with the story which makes it kinda useless because we were expecting to use more of our late game items into the story.

anyway there are also optional bosses to kill if you want more adventure which we really liked doing.

I also would like to see different biomes or perhaps some weather changes - rain or drizzle, snow, fog that could perhaps add some status debuff/effects to the players/insects. or some random event in the world to add more life into it

The combat & parrying system is fun & satisfying, there's lots of perk/mutation customization to make flexible playstyles as well. Base building is incredibly intuitive with lots of ways to decorate & fortify. It's got multiplayer so that's another great plus. Another massive bonus is that there's an entire mode devoted to creating your own custom maps when the base game isn't enough for you; build & share your own backyards to your hearts content.

I was also impressed by the amount of really nice quality-of-life features, like being able to easily move fully constructed building parts without having to deconstruct & rebuild them. Using resources from nearby chests & containers instead of needing them in your inventory for crafting & building is another nice feature. You can also name chests & set them to receive resources from your inventory automatically at the push of a hotkey for easy sorting. Arrows that don't break after a single use, as well as being able to automatically pick them up by walking over them outside of combat instead of having to manually pick them all up, & markers for shot arrows + thrown spears to help you locate them. You also get 3 hotbars to cycle through for being able too quickly swap between tools, weapons, food, water, consumables, & even armor sets. I'm sure I've missed a couple of things while listing them off, but again very impressed by the number of quality-of-life features Grounded boasts.

One of the only critical critiques I have of the game is how *very* late-game, trying to complete absolutely everything, including entirely optional content, can become quite a grind for rare resources, especially if you're trying to kit out multiple people in multiplayer.

I'll say that Grounded has definitely earned its price-tag ($39.99 as of writing), but if you ever see it on sale, definitely consider grabbing it while you can. It has a patchy history of having fairly infrequent discounts, so don't miss out if you can nab a bargain on this excellent survival game.",1706851891,1706851891,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Had two playthroughs, 76h48m not completed and 56h39m completed. Did not get 100% because requirements are insanely difficult. Played solo. Rated 6/10.
Pros:
+ The world and setting. The idea of surviving in a miniature world is quite appealing, and is a break from typical fantasy worlds, that this genre has abundance of. Surviving in a backyard of the regular (not really) house that also manages to have different biomes is a very interesting idea on paper, and this implementation of the world was done quite good.
+ Enemy types and locations. They have also managed to do quite a good job of making regular boring insects like ants and spiders into varying enemies with different types, making  them diverse and interesting.
Cons: 
- Combat and game balance. Even with Tier 3 weapons, mutations and buffs applied, the game is quite difficult. You are forced to carry several weapons with different types in order to even be able to handle most of enemies. Ranged weapons are very inefficient, and you are forced to have a mixed build to survive. Armor bonuses are mostly miserable, and even with all molars applied, you are very squishy and vulnerable to enemies in the upper yard.
 - Game optimization and graphics. The game runs quite poorly, and on a system with 5800x and 6600XT, the CPU and GPU are struggling and overheating, which they don't in most modern AAA games that are more graphically impressive. But even with poor optimization, the graphics look quite bland. They did not implement the most modern version of FSR2, only having outdated FSR, which shows their negligence and laziness, given how long ago FSR2 came out.
- Progression system. Most Tier 1 and Tier 2 weapons and armor suck. Most mutations are useless. The actual useful resources are immensely hard to obtain, and the difficulty slope goes high very fast after obtaining Tier 1 equipment, and the jump to Tier 3 is much harder than that. The only somewhat useful weapons are obtained at the endgame, which doesn't make any sense. Molars are they only way to increase your stats in the classic RPG sense, and finding them is a chore, not something you like to do.",1706718953,1706718953,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

From the art direction to the gameplay, everything is absolutely amazing in this game. I strongly recommend this game with friend, considering some fights are extremely hard alone. 
With Grounded, you get:
- an amazing open-world where the exploration is key: you don't have a map full of ? to guide the player. You see something in the distance, you go there and see for yourself what's there.
- A good base-building game: it's a joy to gather resource and build your camp in this game. You start with a small campfire and end up with a huge base.
- Gigantism: you feel very small in this garden and it's well done. (Beware of the spiders)
- Gorgeous game: beautiful art direction and amazing music

Thanks Obsidian for this gem

Grounded is a game famously notorious for its absolute garbage net code, making multiplayer a profoundly frustrating experience, as well as the developers doing everything in their power to push anyone and everyone off of their game. From the very beginning to post release Grounded is a frustrating experience filled with every bug, glitch, and crash you can imagine. The netcode is so god awful it will have your friends ripping their hair out and uninstalling before you can make it halfway. 

The bosses are hyped up more than Jesus Christ himself and then turn out to be an extremely mediocre fight with absolutely no substance. In almost every case, the bosses aren't even something you want to set out to fight as nothing they drop is anywhere close to endgame gear. [spoiler] In fact, the Infected Broodmother fight which was made impossibly soul crushing on purpose as the developer was told by the team ""Do your worst"" is the gift that keeps on giving. Spend weeks trying to min max your way through this fight while learning to perfect parry attacks faster than your parry animation is. After you beat her realize you didnt get enough materials for literally anything because ""Do your worst"" and do it again. Finally, unlock the boss armor and weapon (The final gear of Grounded) and see that it is literally laughably awful as the developers made it complete garbage.  [/spoiler] Just one more nice middle finger to their entire fan base as they headed out the door. 

Every step of Grounded fills you with the realization that this buggy piece of trash was rushed out the door by the worlds biggest a-hole developers who wanted nothing more than to flip off the community they were striving to build. It's honestly anyone's guess as to why these monsters would intentionally self-sabotage themselves to get back at everyone else but here we are. 

This game isn't worth your hard earned cash. Don't even play it for a laugh or as a joke. It plain out sucks.",1706331075,1706331075,False,1,2,0.29341500997543335,0,True,False,False

However, sadly that which I admired most of the game (it's true visual beauty and design) has gone down in quality. The updates are focused on bug fixes and adding more content, yet there isn't much done to fix the visual environmental issues. The graphics lowered in quality, because of (I think) an update. I used to sit back and stare in wonder at the sights the game gave me, such as gorgeous sunsets on the branch of a massive acorn tree.

cons: hit box's are shit. you can clearly see bugs missing by a mile and they still do damage.
          if you try to doge an attack don't bother. the enemy will turn mid attack like a heat seeking 
          missile.
          stamina at any point can go from 100% to 0 even though i haven't been using it.
          look around everything is safe. not. the enemy's are invisible until they attack.
          enemy's while attacking can teleport through the object your trying to hide behind.

wants: a twirly slide.

In Grounded you'll find a survival adventure game with plenty of things to explore and some great lighthearted humor. It really surprised me with how much depth there is.

Game Completion: ✅

(My Input: I rarely finish Survival games but this one I felt the need to. Absolutely brilliant game, super fun and intriguing story. I managed to complete all optional bosses excluding one [spoiler] the infected broodmother [/spoiler]. The game is very player friendly too. A lot of the game you are guided along and don't really feel the need for using guides or such as a lot of information about certain enemies state their weaknesses and resistances, allowing the player to much more easily decide the weapons and tools you may need for a certain fight or objective. Another thing I felt kept me going was (as I was playing on Medium difficulty) that dying didn't feel like too much of a loss. When you die, all of your loot doesn't just scatter around the ground, potentially losing everything. You still kept weapons, tools, armour, etc and only dropping resources gathered. This is a lot more friendly to a generic player who wants to enjoy the game without the unnecessary need to consistently return to their death point as all you may have dropped on death was a single piece of uncooked bug meat. Progression feels surprisingly fun as well. Not all games feel like this to be completely fair. The main thing I have with survival games that makes me not finish them as often as I should, is simply for the fact that I feel like I am doing all this hardwork and grinding to - in the end - achieve nothing out of the story. Now don't get me wrong, this game does have a bit of grinding too it, but in comparison to any other game in this genre, it is a lot more enjoyable in the sense that you feel like you have made a difference being able to... [Spoiler] For Example, get the required resources needed to craft a better shovel that allows you to farm a single resource to change the way a biome reacts in the world (Plugging the haze with chewing gum) [/Spoiler]. Every resource you scan unlocks new recipes, new recipes unlocks new resources, new resources allows you to craft those recipes to access new zones and so on. Each zone has a unique feel to it as well. This game is brilliant and is so enjoyable I feel that if you enjoy survival games you'd love this game. So much fun and I highly recommend it!)",1705634546,1705634596,True,2,0,0.512315273284912109,0,True,False,False

Grounded is good and has a great atmosphere and solid combat mechanics but most of the game requires a lot of grinding.  I've played survival games before and Grounded has to be one of the grindiest that I have played.  

Many weapons and armors require you to kill and farm for hours on end just to obtain.  Getting materials to upgrade your weapons or armor to be more effective requires deep searching of the many different caves and tunnels within the Backyard. 
Initially exploring is fun and exciting, you are discovering a new (but familiar) world that is full of wonder and mystery.  After the thousandth time walking through the same patch of grass or killing the same spider, it gets old.  91 hours in, I got tired of grinding.  
Ziplines do exist in this game and do help with fast travel, but it is a chore to zip along them for hundreds of times while grinding out objectives.

I really would like to recommend this game, but some of the design choices in this game get boring and lackluster after a while.

Grounded: the game that finally answers the age-old question, ""What if Honey, I Shrunk the Kids was a survival game?"" And let me tell you, it's every bit as awesome as you'd expect. The graphics are so gorgeous, you'll find yourself getting emotionally attached to a blade of grass. And feeling small? Oh, you'll feel small alright. It's like being a borrower in a world where the spiders are the size of SUVs and the dew drops are your personal swimming pools.

The game's packed with quality of life features that make surviving as a tiny human in a giant backyard not just doable, but genuinely enjoyable. Crafting? Smoother than your grandpa's old jazz records. Base building? More satisfying than popping bubble wrap.

And the multiplayer? Flawless. It's like the developers actually understand that we want to play with our friends without needing a degree in server management. It's the perfect game to remind you that size really doesn't matter, especially when you're armed with a spear and your friend is screaming because they're being chased by an ant.

Honestly, there's nothing bad to say about Grounded. It's a tiny world of wonders where every mushroom feels like a skyscraper and every backyard critter is a boss fight.

Starting out seems a little slow, some inhabitants are just ""RUN"" whenever you see them until you can unlock more recipes and understand strategies to dealing with them, but once you get over that progression is solid and paced only as much as you want to progress it. There are a lot of nifty 'tips and tricks' that the game doesn't tell you the first time around and sure you can whip through the story/campaign relatively quickly without too much investment into the exploration or gathering of materials etc.

My partner and I love survival/crafting games and working together to problem solve and progress through them. If I were to critique one thing is the 'collectibles' mini games (Milk Molars/Mega Milk Molars, SCA.B schemes and Raw Science) need a little bit of tweaking when trying to locate them using the radar...and then being able to 'tick' them off the map for those of us who like to complete everything.

Rating: ★★★★☆

Introduction:
Grounded, developed by Obsidian Entertainment, takes players on an immersive journey into a backyard shrunken to the size of insects. This survival game combines elements of exploration, crafting, and teamwork, providing a unique perspective on the world from a minuscule point of view.

Graphics and Design (4/5):
One of the standout features of Grounded is its stunning visual design. The attention to detail in the miniature world is impressive, with lush foliage, towering grass blades, and giant everyday objects transformed into colossal obstacles. The art style strikes a perfect balance between realism and whimsy, immersing players in the charm of being tiny explorers.

Gameplay Mechanics (4.5/5):
Grounded excels in its gameplay mechanics, seamlessly blending survival elements with a compelling narrative. Players must scavenge for resources, craft tools, and build shelters to survive the challenges of the backyard. The unique twist of insect-sized combat and interaction with everyday items provides a refreshing take on the survival genre.

The game introduces an intriguing arachnophobia mode, allowing players with arachnophobia to replace spiders with less-threatening creatures. This inclusive feature demonstrates a commitment to making the game enjoyable for a wider audience.

Exploration and Atmosphere (4/5):
The backyard setting serves as a captivating playground for exploration. From the towering oak tree to the murky depths of a soda can, Grounded encourages players to uncover secrets and adapt to the challenges posed by the miniature environment. The ambient sounds, from buzzing insects to distant lawnmower rumbles, contribute to the immersive atmosphere, enhancing the overall experience.

Multiplayer Experience (3.5/5):
While Grounded offers a cooperative multiplayer mode for up to four players, there are occasional hiccups in synchronization and connection stability. Nevertheless, the collaborative nature of multiplayer adds an extra layer of enjoyment, as players can strategize, build together, and face the miniature world as a team.

Storyline and Quests (3.5/5):
Grounded introduces an engaging narrative with a science-fiction twist, involving mysterious experiments and an unraveling mystery. While the story adds depth to the game, the quest system can sometimes feel repetitive, with similar objectives and tasks. However, the ongoing updates from the developers promise additional content, potentially addressing this concern in the future.

Conclusion:

What I got was a well-designed game featuring a fabulous mashup of genres that just happens to have a solid survival crafting system incorporated into it. 

To date, I can count:
-Skyrim/Fallout/Breath of the Wild type map exploration and puzzle solving (and I have to say, it is an incredibly meticulously made map with tons of biomes, events, secrets, and more to discover. Well done Obsidian)
-Metroidvania-esque discovery (you unlock some new tool that allows you to explore new parts of old areas)
-Terraria-like armor and weapons mixed with the Fallout/Skyrim perk system makes for fun class builds.
- A solid combat system semi reminiscent of Sekiro/Dark Souls (if a little more simplistic and forgiving).
- A recently added map creation system reminiscent of Halo's Forge Mode that allows players to create their own levels. It's only been a month and it's amazing to see what the community has already created!

The sheer amount of effort it must have taken to develop this game into what it is today is incredible.  My friends and I haven't had this much fun in a survival crafting game in a long time.

While a few things still could use some additional polish (adding some additional rewards for exploring certain areas of the map, some quality of life improvements to the UI and crafting systems), this game is an incredibly well made game that I would consider to be complete at this point in development. Thankfully, the team over at Obsidian is planning to continue development for the game going into 2024, so I'm excited to see what else is added before they wrap up production and hopefully move on to making Grounded 2.

If you're a fan of the above genres, I would highly recommend this game. It's not perfect, but it's damn good, with more than enough content to be worth the full price tag (and definitely worth buying if it's on sale).

Game overall feels fun, standard survival, building is pretty easy. Not sure how well the end game will be and if it can hold our interest but we're going to play it for awhile, so much to explore! the world feels very ... umm ""BIG""...


Future ideas that I think could take this game to the next level..

- Tamable bugs ""maybe tame some ants to go harvest grass"" OR Bees to gather pollen for me.
- Ride-able Insects! (need I say more?)
- More variety of insects and environments ( maybe snow in the backyard! forcing more tunnel exploration )
- Allow more players! (create tribes)
--- honestly don't know what bugs I haven't encountered yet so I apologise if these bugs are in the game but I just haven't seen them yet. Bugs I think would be good additions.
- Praying Mantis
- Stick Bug
- Centipedes
- Scorpions
- Millipedes
- Caterpillars, Cocoons and Butterfly's (and Moths)
- Grasshoppers
- Pond Guppies (schools)

Like I said, maybe some of these are in the game, I just haven't seen them yet. Game has so much potential to grow. Love it so far, would love to see more! Or even open the game to a modding community! Let people create new insects to add!

Grounded has been a labor of love for over 3.5 years. Since day 1 release in early access on Xbox Gamepass, I've loved this game and spent thousands of hours fighting for my life (Sometimes...I actually win. haha). No really- If you're like me and you are arachnophobic, They've got a setting for that. Don't discount this game because of the spiders. 

You start at the ""Kid Case"" and venture out, realizing that you're friggen tiny- you've been reduced to a size so small you could literally die from a lawn mite- how annoying and scary is that? You better start building a base- because sooner or later, good ol' Wolfie the Wolf Spider is going to come across your path and sniff you out. And Wolfie doesn't like anyone. 

Through being nosey- you find a Robot named Burg.l. Burg.l.'s design has changed--- his modes used to include a ""kill"" mode during early access--- this is why the community will tell you that Burg.l... Burg.l. is Sus AF. You find out that you're basically the victim of science gone awry and the only person who can help you has gone missing! Oh no! But though completing quests, Conquering and powering up old laboratories hidden around the backyard that has now become your home, and good old combat with the locals - you will acquire the currency simply known as ""raw science'. With said ""Rawwww Sciennnnnnce"" you can purchase upgrades for your base and weapons, hopefully to make it easier to tackle the next sector of the yard and it's inhabitants. {{DON'T KILL APHIDS- They are friends, not food!!!}} Ugh. I have to admit even the aphids are food sometimes and you'll feel incredibly guilty for eating them if you choose to make one your pet. 

Honestly, as a player who has been around since day one.. I can say I highly recommend this game. Believe me when I tell you that the Devs ARE listening (No really, they even stream every Wednesday on Twitch- and showcase the players in the community.). The amount of bugs they've fixed and quality of life improvements they tirelessly provide is astonishing and I don't believe I've ever seen another Dev team like it. They even let us scaredy cats turn the menacing spiders into angry almonds. Don't believe me? Try this game. You really really won't regret it.

I hate the grind most of all. To upgrade equipment past the first tier you'll be forced to take on enemies that are seemingly impossibly tough, and when you manage it (or cheese it) you find that the new equipment didn't even help that much. To get into places like The Haze you need a gas mask which requires you to take out stink bugs, which are hard to take out without the gas mask. The game is filled with such looping dependencies.

I've since read that the fighting mechanics are actually pretty nuanced, and if you know what you're doing most enemies can be taken out without too much trouble even if you're underequipped. Sadly, as far as I can tell, the game does a really poor job of communicating any of these mechanics to the player. My friends and I got to the black ant hill and had no idea how to get in other than to tank our way through the enemies, for instance, and I later read that we [spoiler]could equip full red ant armor and be ignored by red ants, so I presume the same is true for black ants[/spoiler], but how the heck were we supposed to know that? I mean yeah, it kinda makes sense, even if ants don't work that way in real life, but this is a video game where water fleas are aggressive predators of things 3x their size so whatever. Like, you'll have the character tell me 10x an hour that ""The nose knows"" but never say anything about how maybe the [spoiler]ants could be fooled by wearing a suit made from their corpses[/spoiler]?

I don't like the idea that I should have a wiki open to play the game in a reasonable way.

Another issue I have with the game is the tonal dissonance of celebrating the wonders of nature on this scale while demanding the player kills non-aggressive creatures in mass numbers for resources. We were reluctant to murder red ants, which left us alone if we left them alone, and ladybugs, but these are apparently some of the best ways to get early game kit.

Everything degrades and eventually breaks, but that's not too bad because most things being repairable, assuming you have the right resources to hand. But otherwise I find that the game too many resources and different kinds of crafting station to make what are very small incremental improvements. Even when you finally get a second tier hammer and can gather all those molars you've been stumbling across (only some of which get mapped apparently?) the rewards are similarly tiny.

Basically, it seems like the game was designed to take a really long time to play, mostly through the tedium of the crafting loop, and I'm not a fan of that kind of design.

To be fair, a lot of this can be mitigated through difficulty settings, but since I'm playing with other people who are apparently having a much better time than I am, I don't want to try and convince them to drop it from the default.

I will also give the game credit for its arachnophobia settings. One of the group I'm playing with would have a much harder time without it.

Ultimately I can't recommend the game because I, personally, don't like a lot of what it is. But if you're reading all of the above and wondering why I'm whining so much then this game might be up your alley.",1705157101,1705157101,False,2,0,0.498098880052566528,0,True,False,False

For example, a spicy build is ideal for the Broodmother, but a sour build is ideal for black widows. After the grind for different endgame resources, the game becomes far more intriguing to play similar to how it was at the start. End-game you just beat the final bosses, and then finish exploring the yard and building your base. Only tedious thing left is getting all of the golden cards as it is probably the most time consuming part of the game in my opinion. All in all this has been one of my favorite survival games that I have played, and although I am not finished at the time of this review, I have had a blast playing it so far and don't plan to stop until I get that 100% achievement.

EDIT 1: Now that I have completed the story, defeated all of the bosses, and gotten every achievement, I have to say that this game is very enjoyable. After finishing the main story, it got somewhat intimidating and hard to progress, but after you grind resources for a couple hours and deck out your build for the boss you are going to fight, it becomes rather easy. Every boss has a weakness and there are plenty of guides on Steam showing some of the best builds you can get for each boss and what weaknesses / strengths they each had. After having the right class for each boss and plenty of heals, buffs, etc, the only one that was particularly difficult to me was the Infected Broodmother. She took me 4-5 tries to kill, but I felt a sense of accomplishment afterwards. The Infected Broodmother has 3 lives, unlike the other 3 bosses which only have 1. Each phase gets quicker and deals more damage, which made it tricky. After some trial and error, I had defeated her and the main game was done. Afterwards I had to 100% it. Going around the yard and getting all of the collectibles and Milk Molars that I had missed wasn't terrible, but it took me a good 10-15 hours which got boring towards the end. Overall, this game is great and although I have beaten the base game I would still like to build a really nice base in my main save since I have been living in a little shack for the entirety of my playthrough, and I am also interest in the new sandbox mode as there seem to be some cool maps on that.

Singleplayer: 8.6/10 - Can get boring but can also be easier to progress
Mutliplayer: 8.7/10 - Sometimes slower progression but a great time with friends
Completionist: 9.2/10 - Most games now have annoying or tedious achievements to 100% the game, but aside from all of the collectibles which most don't mind, most of the achievements can be completed from playing the main game and there are a few fun ones like scoring a basketball shot from 30m, etc. mixed in.",1704081585,1705036352,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Yesterday, I died of a heatstroke in a freakin’ kiddie sandbox of all places, and the simple fact that I did gave me pause. What a bizarre way to perish. I don’t think I could achieve this feat in many other games.

So, I got this on sale, and this was one of the best investments I've done via Steam. My group of friends and I immediately fell in love with this gem of a game. I sank in twenty hours in the first three days upon getting this, I shit you not. Rare are the games that make me love struck on first play, but this one managed. It's such a joyous moment to experience that weird ""oh crap, this one'll be good"" moment.

Grounded takes an amazing twist on the whole survival genre. Normally, these kinds of games have gotten me a bit jaded, but Grounded does it a clever way, and dayum, it feels so fresh. The fact that your playable character has been shrunken to the size of a flea turns resource gathering in over its head. What seems obvious in other games (chop trees, mine rocks, pick berries, explore nearby caves) suddenly becomes a lot more esoteric in Grounded - yet it still always makes sense. I will forever remember my first time playing, chuckling at the idea that freaking blades of grass now acted as your core building material. How utterly silly. How utterly original.

The map is thrilling to explore. The base building is simple yet intricate. Grinding for crafting never feels like a chore. Journeying to collect resources is always fun. Stumbling upon new ""biomes"" make for some scary new challenges. Combat is fair and well thought-out.

The game just lets you be creative. There are normal “paths” to explore new portions of the map, but you can always bypass them by just bridging and building towers over to them. You won’t be prevented from cheating your way into cool new territories just because you got a little bit clever. Man, how awesome is that?

Anyway. Shit’s fun. I know for a fact that this is a game I’ll definitely cross the 100 hours threshold.",1704907638,1704907638,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

We made a point of exploring all of the main story line Labs together but even if you are not present, you still get to read the story text on-screen and the group reaps the benefits as a team.  For this reason, the game excels as a multiplayer game for a small group.  The Xbox accounts were cumbersome to set up, but worth it to play. The multiplayer game is also stored on the cloud so anyone in your party can host, or even play it solo if no one else is online at the time.

I put 29 hours into the game before we completed it (the major storyline.) There is still plenty to do afterwards, hidden areas and extra bosses that we never even found. My kids probably have twice the hours as I do.

I also really enjoyed that this world was not procedural generated. Every nook and crannie was hand done and done very well wit a lot of thought put into game progression. It is open world in the same sense that zelda is open world: You can go anywhere as long as you can survive and some areas are blocked unless you have the proper item.  The game story and quests also coax you in the right direction.

Overall the building system can be a tad irritating at times. But easy enough to navigate.  Crafting is pretty simple and the way the game scales felt just right.

We played in Mild difficulty and the game felt mostly easy until the final battle, which I wont give it away, but I'll say that it took us three tries to complete and made us feel like we really earned those end credits and involves some actual prior planning and strategy. I can see why only about 4% of players complete the game. The last battle would be very hard on your own.

My kids love it, particularly my 10 year old son.  My 8 year old daughter found it fun, but mostly played because her brother did.  

The game is very ""clean"". nothing rude, no nudity or profanity, all of the death is around insects and so as far as that goes, not much to be concerned over.

The spit and polish on the game is quite good. Graphics are perfect for the game type and target audience, no major glitches were discovered.

As a grown up, I found the game enjoyable. Playing in a group of 4 meant it never felt grindy as we sort of split up a lot of the tasks and there is a lot of leeway for personal exploration since the group shares the major finds and accomplishments.

In summary: I would not recommend this game as a solo play unless you want a real challenge and are willing to put in 50-100 or more hours to get it, but that might be just what some folks want. You can tell that the game was very much designed with 2-4 players in mind. I purchased it (along with two other copies for the kids) on sale but I'd rate it as being worth full price.",1704760707,1704760707,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The building system is nice, I like being able to lay out blueprints for my structures. I also like the appearance of the structures & placeables.  Weapons & armor system with the various perks is cool and it does have an upgrade system for them that feels balanced but also has a bit of grind to it.  You can craft and build automatically pulling resources from storage containers in the vicinity which is a really nice feature.
The shared save feature allows me to share a world with friends essentially giving us a private server for free.

Only 4 players at a time in game, even just a couple more would be really nice.

Open World game set in a garden, which may seem small at first, but the map is actually big. It's a base-building game with lots of crafting.

Personally I recommend the game in Co-op, but I picked up the Gold cards on my own.

Currently all Achivements are completed in the game, hopefully there will be an update with more content. Solo map has 2 bases and 4 outposts built for easier movement.

The game is fantastic, arguably my favorite survival game however it is simply quite buggy, not a unbearable amount, the game is still very playable, however you will get random enemies stuck in the ground, even with higher tier enemies, making them easy to kill. making you able to get stuff early what you really shouldn't, the progression outside of bugs is pretty perfect, and the AI is mediocre at best, ladybugs are meant to be a semi difficult kill, yet getting on a flower is basically a KO for them since they just run into it over and over. One other issue is the game is sorta built for multiplayer so when playing on your own is incredibly hard. Other than these issues i would argue literally everything else is perfect, the game is fantastic outside of its glaring issues in the bug department and minor game play issues.",1704588909,1704588909,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If not the tons of bugs, it could compete for the best open world survival craft game ever. I recommend giving it another year or two and watching whether the devs finish this Early Access quality product.

Note that the game is rather difficult and I can't imagine playing it solo - you will need at least one friend to play with.

[h1]There is a number of good ideas and features...[/h1]

... however a lot of them are lacking or only work sometimes:
[list]
[*] You can unpack your entire backpack to nearby chests that have matching items. This can be controlled per chest (so that you don't unpack your arrows to the chest which has more arrows), however it cannot be controlled per item (i.e. you cannot lock an item in your inventory). Also, this ""hot deposit"" feature doesn't work with ""wood logs"" carried on the shoulder.
[*] When holding a repair tool, damaged buildings are highlighted in red - however it only works sometimes; and also, sometimes it highlights damaged buildings even if you don't hold the repair tool in your hand.
[*] Crafting and building first draws resources from nearby chests - no more running around the base to bring the resources to the crafting table. However, sometimes I would prefer if it drew resources from the backpack first, and there is obviously no setting for this.
[*] You can create a shared world with chosen friends, so that any of them can be a host (and play without the others). However, the game requires Microsoft Xbox account which is somewhat unreliable - I had a number of disconnects despite having Internet and Steam connection. Also, already hosted game very often doesn't show up in available games, and I have to join it by selecting a friend on Steam and clicking ""join game"".
[*] Your arrows and thrown spears get a marker on the HUD, however it frequently doesn't show at all.
[*] Walking over arrows picks them up. Sometimes.
[/list]

[h1]And here comes the bad stuff...[/h1]

The most frequent bug is insects getting totally stuck between grass, stones or even inside the walls. Not sure if it's a bad thing, because I can't imagine fighting with them melee.

[b]There is a lot of interface and key mapping bugs:[/b]
[list]
[*] Open chest can only be closed with ESC, not with TAB, unlike the inventory.
[*] Keys shown at the bottom of the screen sometimes don't work at all (or they do something else like ESC opening a menu instead of closing a radial selection), and you have to press the button using a mouse.
[*] Items quite often cannot be interacted with - e.g. the object gets highlighted, you get the info ""press E to pick up / hold X to destroy"", and while holding X works fine, pressing/holding E does nothing.
[/list]

[b]There is a number of ""we are too lazy to implement it"" features:[/b]
[list]
[*] Only one person can be looking in the chest at the time.
[*] No compass or mini map.
[*] Position (and facing direction) of players doesn't refresh on the map - you have to reopen the map to see the up to date information.
[*] Mutations (aka skills) and status effects lack any meaningful explanations, so get ready for things like ""Block more."" or ""The fungus (...) lends its power to your unarmed attacks."". No description provides any numbers of how big the bonuses actually are - get ready to play with the wiki open.
[*] Charged bow shot mean to keep a bow fully charged for an unknown amount of time. There is no indicator whether your shot will be ""charged"" or ""uncharged"".
[*] Building requires placing a blueprint and then bringing resources to it to actually construct it. Would be nice if buildings destroyed by insects were actually leaving the blueprint behind, so that it's easier to reconstruct it.
[*] Audio is muted when game is not focused and there is no setting to change it.
[*] Number of insects reuse models, textures, sounds and even names. So get ready for things like Ladybug and Ladybird, which in real world are two names of the same insect, but in this game are totally different enemies.
[*] Trail Marker buildings which display a map waypoint, show their names only on HUD but not on the map.
[*] When another player is gliding on the dandelion tuft, you cannot see the tuft, they just look as if they were falling.
[/list]

[b]There is a number of ""why would you ever do this"" issues:[/b]
[list]
[*] Map marker placed manually disappears after time.
[*] Searching crafting recipes works only in an active category - and there is 10 categories...
[*] When deconstructing an object, sometimes ingredients drop lose on the ground, and sometimes are placed all in a single bag. Would be nice if they were actually placed in the player backpack (or shoulder in case of ""wood logs"").
[*] After one quest you get an NPC that flies around a random player and annoys them - it doesn't fight, and often gets in the way of shooting.
[*] Some buildings, when snapping, can be rotated by 45 degrees, others only by 90.
[*] Resource nodes drop fake items that disappear after a few seconds, so you have to wait before you can pick the real items.
[*] Your flying pet that follows you can knock you out of a zipline.
[/list]

[b]And finally, there is a number of ""how the f*** is this even possible"" bugs:[/b]
[list]
[*] One player interacting with objects in the world disrupts other players' interface. It causes blinking, scrolls lists to the top, prevents writing etc.
[*] After encounter with a fish I was being pushed and thrown in random directions - at first I thought it's a water flow, but this continued even on land until I restarted the game...
[*] Another time I got an empty map marker displayed in the centre of the screen - until I restarted the game...
[*] When busting certain candies, the FPS drops to around 3.
[*] Light from the headlight is displayed in the world differently depending on whether I am in the first person or third person view. Makes me wonder how it shows for other players...?
[*] Some buildings are placed not where they are showing before placing.
[*] Frequent desyncs between the clients and the host - clients often see items in different places than they really are, and as a result cannot interact with them.
[*] Collectables proximity detector sometimes gets stuck and keeps showing the same signal strenght despite moving around.
[*] The expiry time of food stored in the fridge keeps running and shows the correct value only once you transfer it to your backpack.
[/list]

[b]Oh, and there are obviously tons of bugs when building:[/b]
[list]
[*] Sometimes the blueprint shows in blue, yet you cannot place it anyway.
[*] Sometimes objects are obstructing each other when they shouldn't; another time they intersect each other just fine.
[*] Sometimes if you move the object, you cannot place it back where it was (and there is snapping).
[*] Sometimes support doesn't work, and buildings flow in the air.
[*] Or sometimes they fall despite having support.
[*] Sometimes two buildings are supporting each other, preventing you from moving either of them.
[*] Sometimes an object cannot be deconstructed because it claims that it supports something, even though there is nothing nearby.
[*] And so on...

The graphics and colors are vibrant, and I really dug the bizarre bug-punk aesthetic to all the ""technology"" you create.

It's been a while since I've played one of these types of games, but the quality-of-life improvements are very much appreciated. Building, copying buildings, rapid-assembly are all a breeze, and it makes creation fun. I particularly liked the base-defense mechanic, as it tends to partially destroy you base, requiring you to repel the bugs and rebuild. It keeps the survival aspect fresh.

Also appreciated the comfiness mechanic, as you are given many reasons for putting together a nice-looking, lived-in location. The fact that you can build essentially anywhere in the game is very cool, and I wish every game like this allowed you to do so.

Story is charming, I liked Dr. Wendell in particular. I could've done with more story progression, especially on the Ominent side, but the dream sequences were cool and evocative. I appreciate how this game never loses sight of the fact that you are tiny, you are at the very bottom of the food chain, and the human world is terrifying. Having the largest living creature you regularly encounter be a crow that is utterly oblivious to your existence is very cool.

I have a few gripes. The final achievement (getting 100%) has now become impossible to get since the latest patch, as it requires you to get a 1% drop from every type of bug in the game, including bosses. That's just absolutely absurd. It took 640 of one type of bug for me to get one of those. It's disappointing to get 99% completion, and have it require months of real-time grinding to get 100%. Nobody should attempt that.

The other issue is the hardiness of the bugs, which starts to get annoying, even when you're using optimal equipment and damage type. With good equipment, you should be able to kill a thing in three or so hits. 6-10 just gets tedious. There are also far too many ladybug larva in the late game, which gets annoying.

Those aside, I absolutely adored playing this title, and I look forward to each new content update. The Infected Broodmother was a fantastic addition, and I look for the next challenge.",1704347027,1704347027,True,1,0,0.444444417953491211,0,True,False,False

full of bugs.
-non-host players will see buildings of other players  as incomplete when master has them completed, meaning your client will attempt to go through them then teleport randomly when master tells you you shouldn't have passed through.
-non-host players will see MANY water bubbles bugged in the air after host player as farmed them, making the watering experience frustrating for non-hosts.
-non-host players sometimes can't interact properly with doors
-no packet loss prevention or recovery, making networking experience often jitterish
-random game breaking bugs sometimes occurring. For example, experienced a bug where bow and arrow can't be used by the non-host player at all. Reloading is impossible.

It's sad to see that developers are getting away with publishing an unfinished product.

( so many new games and being released and we need something to bring back the people  )  

 I have over 500 Hours in this game playing single player and multiplayer. We have replayed the game multiple times and i want more. This game is extremely repayable and somehow i never get bored.  Building is one of my favorite things to do in the game, and your focus has became targeted on it, but i feel the ball has been dropped on this. Instead of more bugs to kill for more crafted you made a playground mode which only targets creative players (in my opinion.)   I get bored with creative mode since there is no achievement for collecting all these resources and building this masterpiece. 


 
DLC ideas 
After you choose to to take the  Embiggening cocktail and prompt displays after the cutscene.  

- PROMPT 1 if you have not  defeated  Director Schmector the kids science  team will work together to reverse  the effects of raisining  on Dr. Wendell Tully.  
- PROMPT 2   if you have defeated Director Schmector the kids science  team work with Wendell on something involving the SPAC.R

Scenarios for the DLC 

Unlocking the house after beating the game ( adding incentives for people to actually complete the game. )
-  this can add additional bugs and crafting components that can only be gathered by completing a specific stage of the game
- you can also add bugs to the window beside the door and after beating these you get a peak into the house and see some of the things we could encounter later.  
 Something on top of the wall ( new mutation for going to such heights  )  
- you added so much details  to the outside of the wall might as well use the map a little more. 
- this could be a secret boss added after purchasing the DLC or just secret bug rewarded for adventuring  so far and exploring the yard more  


 Adding additional bugs  for extra crafting.  ( i would not want it to be weapons because if they are over powered  or gave extra perks someone could use those to beat the game faster and it would seem like a buy to win scenario. ) 

Areas that need more stuff added 
- The front porch
- The garbage area 
- Brick ledge  by the Hedge  

Additional bug ideas 
I LOVE how accurate you are with the bugs you added.  I have seen videos where  a Entomologist  played the game and advised on how accurate they looked and the  attacks were, and how they perfected matched the bugs. i would love to see more of this.
  
Field crickets ( and other species as well  )
- Location -Under Large rocks (ex by haze and swamp area)
- Facts - The habitat of ''T. commodus'' consists of rocky surfaces or ground with large amounts of cracks as it gives them shelter from the sun
- Equipment / Drops - shell for shield, new scythe using legs

Fleas
Location - Log pile, under front porch.
 Facts - Fleas thrive in many climates but prefer moist, humid, and shady areas. The area underneath a porch or deck can turn into an overwintering site. Areas with tall grass, leaf litter, weeds, wood piles, gravelly areas, and sandy patches are all attractive to fleas.
Equipment / Drops - infected blood bomb

Roach
- Location - Trash Can, Under the porch, and around the front door  
- Facts The American cockroach prefers to inhabit warm, humid areas, being common in kitchens, food storage areas, basements, - boiler rooms and sewers.
Equipment / Drops - shell for shield, spear using antennas.

Blue belly lizard ( AKA western fence lizard )   ( i seen you tried to add this or considered it )
- location - Around the house / upper yard wall  ( maybe by the window )   
- Facts - commonly seen sunning on paths, rocks, fence posts, and other high places,  
- Equipment/ Drops - Tier 4  platted armor  or  scales used for crafting 

House centipede  
- location - Upper brick area by the  hedge  (  glide  down into a crack   showing the hiding place )  
- Facts -  Centipedes are nocturnal, leaving their daytime cover to find food. They’re attracted to spots with a lot of moisture.   When fighting something close to their size, centipedes will catch a foe with their jaw and inject a venomous bite.

This game is similar to Valheim in in many ways; format, quality/stability and gameplay loop. However, the themeing and 3d modelling are far better.

The format is limited to 4 players per server, each player inhabiting one of the four playable teenagers. Your gear will be saved to your steam account, and each time you log in you will be able to select whichever character you'd like to have decked out in your kit. Singleplayer and Multiplayer are both available. There is no Dedicated Server mode, so make sure to have whoever has the highest performance computer host the game.

The quality and stability of this game are great. No mesh issues, the AI is modern, no obvious problems with misbehaving items or abilities.

The gameplay loop is what you would expect for the genre. The farming aspect is kept light. You'll find yourself gathering resources, building a base, fighting bugs and trying to figure out how to get back to normal size.

What could be improved?
End-game travel gets to be a lot. It started to feel like DayZ where 70% of the game was running.

Progression-gated itemization leads to some quality-of-life items only being available for a couple hours of campaign gameplay.

What are the highlights?
The 3d modelling in this game is imaginative and well-executed. If you used Sap and an acorn-top to build your item, then you'll see both of those resources in the finished and placed model. It's adorable, looks amazing, and provides a good deal of immersion to the experience.

The building system is a great implementation of what other survival games provide with some added improvements.

What could be added?
Late-game travel concerns can be addressed in many ways. Many games use either ridable mounts or teleportation. While adding a teleporter item would be easy for implementation, Taming is one of my favorite Survival game systems.",1703866136,1703866136,True,3,0,0.565217375755310059,0,True,False,False

I'm updating this review as we tried to return to it to see if it gained some polish and fun.

Short answer: No.

Realistically, this should be called 'Grinded'. Often in survival games there's a bit of a grind loop, especially if you want to build some neat stuff. This is totally fine and helps make you have a sense of accomplishment. The problem is, it never ends. It never feels like you achieved anything in this game, you never have figured anything out, you've never succeeded. 

Combat is a slog, every enemy even with upgraded weapons in armor is a health sponge. Unlocking new items often requires strange and exotic parts for no apparent reason other than to make it more difficult and pad out its lackluster story and play time.

Updated Review:

The game is so much better and I still recommend it. They continue to improve the game with free updates and are fixing glitches. I was able to successfully continue an older save from 1 year ago. Right now my favorite part is the ability to share your world with a friend who can come online to do stuff while you are offline, such as base building and resource gathering (that's what I do) which makes it easier to explore the map when you don't have to keep worrying about the same resources.",1638720186,1703667290,True,1,0,0.519774019718170166,0,True,False,True

Combat is a slow affair of block/parry, attack in the window while the enemy is stunned, wait for stamina to regen, heal, repeat. Most enemies outside the starting area take 3 or 4 three-hit combo cycles minimum to go down with the weapons you'll be using when it's relevant to fight them for progression/resources (i.e. one tier below what the critter is since you need tier 2 critter parts to make tier 2 weapons/armor), which is about 20-30 seconds per critter. Creature hostility and density is high so there's a very good chance you'll be fighting 3 or 4 enemies at a time on a regular basis while traversing the map. On anything but mild difficulty the enemies also deal punishing amounts of damage to the player when they mess up, further slowing combat as the player will need to spend more time healing/running away/respawning.

Resource gathering is also tedious. Most of the resources for tools/equipment to progress the game come from hunting critters, meaning that even if you don't really enjoy combat you're forced into it to progress. Low % drop rate items from these critters (seriously, why do bees only drop stingers 20% of the time?) mean you'll be spending a LOT of time grinding kills. Base building also takes a vast amount of resources (which is understandable) but the lack of a way to increase inventory size (other than carry a few more planks) or use a mount/fast travel means the player spends even more time running back and forth dealing with overly hostile critters, further adding to the slog. For example, I've done so many trips to the hedge to get berry chunks, it's one of the most overused resources in the game and is only found in one corner of the map.

Then there's base raids. If you kill too many of a type of critter, they'll raid your base that you spent hours building and can quickly do a lot of damage. The game has no automated defenses, and flying enemies will glitch through walls and be a huge PITA. The game tells you none of this up front of course so you'll be fighting off swarms of mosquitoes as part of normal gameplay only to suddenly have them mount a raid on your base (seriously, mosquitoes aren't even territorial IRL and this makes absolutely no sense) and potentially destroy hours of your work. Of course this ""feature"" is enabled by default on ALL difficulty options and can only be turned off in a custom game mode which disables achievements.

I'm not even going to touch the endgame boss fights based on my experience so far with the story bosses, unless you've got amazing reflexes, pattern recognition and stamina for intense boss fights and have the time to ""git gud"" they're going to be a miserable experience for most players without a bunch of fully geared up friends.

In co-op these issues lessen as you have more firepower in a group of players to more quickly dispatch enemies, a larger group inventory to lessen the resource grind, and people to interact with to pass the time traversing the map. For solo play though, I've just been finding the game tedious.

I've given up on any achievements myself and just finally switched over to a custom game mode once the raids started coming. I made it through most of the story and that finally broke me. It's not worth it having to deal with that nonsense, and while I was in the custom game settings I pretty much turned off all the annoying features of the game (stamina, item durability, creature aggression) and knocked the creature health way down just so I can finish out the story and explore the areas of the map I've missed with minimal additional slog since the world design and story are the highlight of the game for me anyways. Then I'll probably hop into a creative map and just mess around with building for awhile like I used to do in Subnautica.

I know a lot of people gush about how great this game is, but honestly I found myself more and more disappointed the farther into the game I got with how much time I spent in combat I never really enjoyed in the first place.",1702089422,1703661786,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

here are some things that i think need to expand/rework:
-raid attack. its too easy too clear when you have a have base on top of the tree.
-story. too short
-summon boss. most of the boss can be tank it and doesnt really have a unique moveset, also the summon boss is too few.
-weapon enchanment. its making the game more easier without big effort. id rather have a mastery weapon concept instead of enhancement.
-biome exploration. the only biome that is fun and challanging is the sand one. the pond biome got so much potentional for submarine actiivities yet theres only swimming gear and little things to explore in the pond.
-castle toy. it should have been a big labyrinth and full of trap.

here are some suggestion for the next update:
-weapon mastery instead of weapon enhancement.
-home, deep pond with submarine kinda things exploration, also ice biome ( like a broken fridge )
-rain/stormy weather and fo.
-choice matter, so it have a replayability for the game.
-time based event
-mini game with friend
-abnormal bugs that have different moveset
-boss gatekeeping for story ( so people spend more time preparing and not just skip the boss )
-new story, especially make some PUZZLE.",1703654111,1703654111,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have played on and off since early access in 2020 on console from xbox gamepass and have played every major update since. I finished the game at the 1.0 release and haven't touched the game since until about 2 weeks ago after I got a PC.

After playing the game on PC, I can say that Grounded is one of my top 10 favourite games of all time.

Combat, Weapons and Armour:
The combat system, with perfect blocking, is a fantastic way to reward players for learning attack patterns and timing parry's allowing good players to take on the toughest Insects with ease, creating that fun skill ceiling that makes you want to improve to become a Grounded combat master. Different insects have different weaknesses and resistances making the choice of weapon matter. Not only do each weapon type deal different types of damage, but there is also elemental damage as well adding another layer of choice and skill to killing insects. The armour and weapons get stronger the further you progress and all have unique mechanics to give them all a fresh feel and to keep the game play from feeling repetitive. And the layer of combat don't stop there, because there are buffs and debuffs that happen depending on the bug you are facing, so don't forget to eat a meal and drink a smoothie as these are ways to get extra buffs to help take down enemies easier. So weather you prefer shooting you're enemy with a bow made from wasps, or want the clobber them with a club made from ants, or maybe you want to slice them in two with a battleaxe made from candy, Grounded has got something for you.

Mutations:
Mutations are a game mechanic that work amazing with the core game adding extra abilities to the player for as long as the player chooses. you unlock different mutations throughout the game by doing different challenges around the yard. Want to run faster, mutation for that, want more hauling strength (carry more stuff), mutation for that, want to minions to fight for you, mutation for that. Mutations are a fantastic and integral addition to the game.

Story:
I will keep the story section spoiler free. The story progresses at a good pace with different data pieces to help piece together the story. I love how it gives the choice to the player on what to do, but guides them so you don't end up never progressing. As you play though the game, different areas of the map have locations you will visit and you get rewarded by unlocking items that will help you take on tougher insects. They really tried to make the story interesting with the players who want more from the story being able to search around for extra pieces of data, whereas if you just want to get through the main story stuff and speed through the progression, you can do that too. It doesn't hold your hand and baby you through the game, but doesn't require a wiki or youtube video to know what to do next. It's hard to talk about the story without spoiling it, so you will have to find out yourself if you play this game.

Exploration:
finding things to discover is easy because of how much the map is packed full of things to find, with raw science, milk molars, sca.b's, new resources, and much more which can give you upgrades, weapons, armour or other goodies. Landmarks can be found around the map and give you a reward for finding them which is a fun way to motivate people to explore the backyard. But if you weren't convinced to explore the backyard, you can find a plethora of different insects. From spiders, to beetles, to ants. Some insects fly, some crawl, and some swim. Some friendly, some neutral and some angry. The variety in insects makes the game so easy to sink hours into, learning and mastering the all the insects.

Building:
The building is easy to understand and has plenty of different things you can build, allowing for creativity. you could build whatever you want really. I'm currently building a basketball stadium because basketball is a playable sport (to a certain extent) in Grounded. Build yourself a base anywhere you like, just be careful because you may annoy the local insects. Building is what can make a play through of the game a long a fun process, giving you a reason to keep playing after you beat the game to 100%. But if gathering resources doesn't tickle your fancy, Grounded has a creative mode allowing you to build whatever you want right away.

Bosses:
I don't want to spoil any bosses because the feeling of walking into a fight not knowing whats coming is a thrilling experience you will get only once. The bosses are all unique, with some being optional and some tied to the story. After facing all of them I can safely say that fighting these bosses with not disappoint. Fighting these bosses give unique and powerful drops making it feel worth fighting the optional bosses. I was not disappointing when facing these almighty foes.

Extra challenge:
Last little thing to talk about is those who want a challenge. Although there is a hard difficulty (Whoa!), I like a real challenge. At the end of the game you receive a report card, it basically shows stats like ""insects killed"" and ""Deaths"". You also get a grade based on how much of the game you completed (including the optional stuff). So for those who are completionists like me, Grounded has a completionist challenge with a steam achievement tied to it.

Grounded will forever be a game I will look back on be glad I got to play it. I highly recommend you play this game.

Upon reading my previous review, I felt the need to quickly write an updated version since Grounded is one of my favorite games

[h3] Exploring the Backyard [/h3]
The exploration in the Backyard takes me back to my childhood when I would explore my backyard and imagine the many happenings of the vast yet tiny world beneath my feet. The many different Biomes found in the Backyard offer a distinct feel to the entirety of the map which, alongside the unique landmarks scattered around the map, assist in giving the player an easier time when traversing and finding their way around the map. 

[h3] Combat [/h3]
The combat in this game is centered around its blocking mechanic. All the mobs have a set of moves with each move having its own telegraph and if you can do a perfect block, the damage is negated. Each mob also has weaknesses and resistances that are found out upon PEEPing the creature which gives each weapon a time to shine in the player's arsenal. The different builds that can be created using combinations of weapons and mutations prevent the need to utilize any ""meta"" builds.

[h3] Recommended Difficulty [/h3]
I would recommend anyone confident in their ability to read enemy telegraphing to play this game in Whoa! difficulty, especially if they are playing with other people who have experience with similar games. I found Medium to be fairly relaxed and would recommend it for people who want to focus more on the exploration side without having to worry too much about combat. If you have no experience with any combat in games, you might want to set it to Mild difficulty.

[h3] Achievement Hunters [/h3]
For those who are a fan of getting 100% Steam achievements, this game is very reasonable in the difficulty of their achievements. If you encounter and defeat every mob, you will most likely already have around 80% of the achievements. The remaining ones would be finding every collectible which is a lot easier in Grounded compared to other games with similar ""collect them all"" achievements.

[h3] Conclusion [/h3]
All in all, I would highly recommend anyone who is a fan of open-world survival craft games to pick Grounded up. If you are someone with an interest in the genre but haven't been able to decide on which game to start with, Grounded would be a fantastic first pick. [b] (Also play it with friends!)

The requirements include the gold card death-drops of every single creature, which have a 1% drop rate regardless of how common or rare the creature is (except for bosses with 10%), rolled on spawn rather than death - has lead to me spending hours save-scumming to finally achieve this.
Additionally, there are unmarked Data Logs and Notes which are extremely hidden on the map and have no indication on the in-game scanner, and some that are in the natural progression path that are not very visible as you go through the location.

Without the good work done by online guides and the interactive map/checklists by Map Genie, I feel like 100%-ing this game would have taken double the time I spent on it, which already clocked in at 297 hours - and so unless the above issues are addressed, I would not recommend the game to people like myself who value the completionist aspect.",1703324326,1703324326,False,1,0,0.474156230688095093,0,True,False,False

phrase of goalpost
unfairly alter the conditions or rules of a procedure during its course. - Oxford Languages

 Grounded as of November 13th 2023, has moved the goalpost for achieving 100% completion of the game.
With the update, you now have to grind for ""Gold Cards"" for every single insect in the game. Gold cards have a 1% drop rate. Meaning if you did not finish the game prior to the 13th update, You now have to spend potentially hundreds of more hours grinding out that 1% for each of the 64 enemies in the game.

Never before have I seen a piece of software so perfectly engineered to extract misery from its end user that even its many failures seem to advance its infernal ends.

How devilish to furnish your multiplayer game with netcode that causes consistent lag and then have the combat system centered around precise parry timings! How demonic to make players disconnect at random times, which causes their inventories to disappear if it happens while they're downed.  How diabolical to include an enemy that forces players to drop their weapons, build a physics engine that makes dropped items roll down the tiniest of inclines, then fail to fix a glitch that causes objects to clip into walls and become permanently inaccessible! A brilliant three step combination with devastating results! I stand in awe of the sheer maliciousness of it.

 It takes virtually no effort to make a game that is simply bad. Steam is inundated with garbage, made by people whose design philosophy starts and ends at stapling giant tits onto Unity assets. Obsidian laughs at such amateurs. 

An incompetent developer might create an open world survival game with no fast travel options, but an evil one will make the fast travel torturously slow, then add enemies that can attack players while they're using it. A bad developer might forget to include the option to split resource stacks, but an evil one will make sure it can only be done one item at a time. What's that? Grounded has functional stack splitting now? Oh, well I guess it only took a year after the game's full release to implement something that existed in Minecraft over a decade ago.  

And it goes on and on like this! No rest for the wicked. Platforming in first person (or having to deal with the terrible third-person camera). Underwater combat. Rapid weapon degradation. Horrible boss design. Annoying flying enemies that poison you and run away to heal themselves. Tedious late game farming to fully upgrade equipment. Achievements locked behind another insufferable grind (added in the latest series of updates, just to make sure players weren't having too much fun).

Okay, I'm done mincing words. Enough is enough. I despise Grounded. It is one of the worst multiplayer experiences of my entire life. A broken, horrific abomination that suckers you in with its clever premise and charming presentation all the while slowly draining you of your happiness. It is the abattoir of fun. A game so bad I would pay to forget that I'd ever played it. A clear indication that developers need their own version of the Hippocratic Oath.

Grounded is creative, deep, immersive and well designed. The hard mode is a real challenge as you got to use every resource and mechanic available as well as study the enemy movements to win most fights.

It's a long game, and better suited to be played with at least one friend, but I've been playing ony my own and I've had more than enough my share of fun while being little over 100 hours and I'm guessing I'm still halfway through.
The depth in this is really surprising. Heck, you have enough tools and options to make many different builds.
Some parts on the hard mode will feel grindy, but you are heavily reward for exploring.
Some mechanics are not explained outright, but there's a pace to unlocking everything.

First, it seriously lacks directions. You reach a quest marker and see nothing around. The objective might be above you, below you, or beyond an impassable wall. To reach it you must find the secret entrance, which is often distant from the marker, with no discernible path. After roaming in circles for an hour the first time, we started relying on Youtube tutorials, and spent much of the playtime with the game minimized, watching tutorials and then repeating the steps like idiots.

Second, the game has too much of everything. Weapons, resources, structures. For example, there are maybe 8 types of level 2 helmets, but you only need one. Everything else is background noise. There is no distinction between functional and aesthetic buildings, and both categories include mostly ones that seem pointless. For example, there are several types of cooking stations, which allow preparing different categories of food - but the most common and basic category is good enough, at least on low difficulty.

Speaking of, the difficulty is not well-balanced. We started out on medium difficulty, but became frustrated when stronger foes repeatedly killed us instantly. We lowered the difficulty, killed some of those foes and crafted better armor - and suddenly most fights posed no challenge whatsoever. But there are still creatures that easily kill you, so we didn't increase the difficulty back.

Combat is annoying. Online guides say you need to wait for the enemy to attack, block and retaliate. But the attack patterns are difficult to discern and remember for each type of foe, and often you fight many creatures simultaneously... IT SIMPLY ISN'T FUN.

The element I enjoy most in survival/crafting them is resource collection and organizing. That's hardly a thing in Grounded, because there are so many resources - and you don't need 99% of them 99% of the time. Sometimes, a resource you need is annoying to collect at your current stage. For example, there is an underwater quest that requires diving equipment, which in turn requires underwater resources. These are a nightmare to collect when you often need to go up for air. Throughout the quest you receive more resources, by which time you're done with diving...


The respawn mechanism is God-awful. You spend a large portion of the game running back from respawn points to your current task. There is no fast travel, nor devices that speed up movement (at least at my stage of the game). While running you constantly need to circumvent obstacles: plant stems, roots that you need to climb from exactly one possible direction, a blocked path which you must go around - again and again, every time you want to grab some resource from the base or hunt some beetle. And at any moment you might be attacked. I was expecting somewhat of a chill experience - this isn't it.

The story is conveyed through dialogues and recordings which are unbelievably long, boring, and recorded in a dissonant voice which makes them annoying to listen to.

The menu system is robust but stupid. For example, the Craft tab has a search function, but it only shows results within the current category of items. So if you don't remember which category an item belongs to, you first filter by item name, and then go category by category(!) to check which one contains the filtered item name. Another example: when crafting a weapon or armor, the game doesn't show a side-by-side stats comparison with your current armor. You need to manually move the mouse between the new and old armor to compare.

Bottom line: This game feels like homework. There are small moments of satisfaction, but at no point was I actually enjoying the gameplay and mechanics. It's not a terrible game, but it mostly made me miss other games.",1702769253,1702802955,False,1,0,0.461210757493972778,0,True,False,False

i've contacted steam and requested a refund, resulting in a denial each time. this game is NOT WORTH THE $40 THEY WILL TAKE FROM YOU. steam's policy only refunds games with 2 hours of game play or less, but the issues were not coming out right off the bat. i played less than 7 hours out of it and my pc can not handle a minute more. go to XBOX and pay the game pass fee (typically $1 the first month, $9.99 each month after) if you don't have it already and you will have a better experience and a broader range of games included.",1702743881,1702744005,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

You start with nothing.

You gain a healthy amount of fear for everything around you. 

You try your hand at taking a back yard predator down... You get schmacked. 

Then, you either have to find something you can take down for better gear / change strategy / fighting style / change mutations.

The game does a very good job at establishing a food chain. And you definitely have a feel on where you stand on that chain.

Would squeal at the sight of a wolf spider again.

Update: Was very close to 100%'ing the game. New update came out and made getting gold cards a requirement for all achievements. As an achievement hunter, this sucks big time. Gold cards on standard mobs are a 1% chance to drop, with no way to increase that chance. So have fun grinding one mob for 2 hours 70+ times. Sucks major cheeks on Termite King, which is not grindable and has a 2 and a half hour respawn time.

Grounded is a well polished + well rounded game that offers anything from chill exploration, building, crafting, resource grinding, decent action, and with the latest ""Playgrounds"" update, the ability to make obstacle courses and races. It is Q4 2023 and the devs are (still) continuously updating the game and adding new features. 

I played this with my children and had the greatest time exploring and battling bugs and building locations like quick defensive forts to massive mushroom mansions to zip lines that spanned the entire backyard. Grounded is no walk in the park though, some of the bosses put up a very difficult fight that requires certain mutations (perks) to be leveled up, and leveled up armor and weapons, in addition to teamworking strategies. 

There is another game trying to copy this game on Steam ( I won't say the name because it doesn't deserve the recognition) but Grounded is extremely well polished compared to that nonsense. 

My only minor gripe is the playable character ""Max"". Nobody ever wants to play as Max. Max is a token character and would not have been included in the game had this game been made in a sensible era. He is the most annoying and obnoxious character with an annoying voice and ghetto sounding quips that contradict himself with just about everything. He's also a bully to Pete (the nerdy playable character). I get that this is just a game... but... the characters in the game would NEVER be friends with someone like Max. Max sucks.

Character creation would have been the icing on the cake with this game but still...Grounded is a wonderful game that provides hundreds of hours of exploration and crafting and building. I highly recommend this game for all ages.",1702625902,1702625902,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game works flawlessly on the deck, stable 40 fps on high graphics. It’s very fun to play handheld, more than the console versions for sure. 

I really like the fact and also recommend that you change the settings in the beginning to make things easier for yourself at least until you get the hang of things. I love that I can scale the hunger/thirst levels to my liking, as well as the day/night cycle. 

It’s easy to get lost in this game and if you don’t mind that then you will have a good time otherwise stick to the main quest because the menu map sucks. 

There’s a ton of customization and crafting available here so you can really get lost in that if that’s your thing, not so much for me but I do enjoy the concept of a cozy home somewhere in the middle of the map. 

If you ever watched “Honey I Shrunk the Kids” you will for sure enjoy this “little” gem. 

Side Note - There’s also a toggle for arachnophobia mode if you’re scared of spiders.

The enemies take some practiced strategy to defeat, each one has its own strengths and weaknesses to help you kill them. At the beginning, the strategy is to get away, because you don’t have the weapons or armor to win. 

Pretty much every aspect of the game can be altered to your liking (how fast you become hungry and thirsty, how much damage you take, what you drop when you die, etc.) so if the default settings aren't to your liking, you can completely customize your playing experience. 

There are a few bugs. Enemies getting stuck in walls or even the ground. I was building walls and they were solid and built for me, but they looked like the blueprint of a build for my boyfriend, who I was playing with, though he couldn’t walk through them. 

I like that things such as missions and analyzed materials are synced across all players when playing co-op. I think you’ll appreciate it too if you’re playing with someone on a different skill set. I’ve found in other games I’ve played with my boyfriend, he’s miles ahead in player level and unlocked weapons and armor and I’m lagging behind and it’s just not as fun like that (yes, I know that’s a skill issue on my part, but the opinion still stands). It’s nice to play on equal ground with Grounded. 

One thing I really don’t like is the hot bar/inventory. You can’t scroll through your hot bar quickly, you have to open your menu wheel and enter your inventory that way. You do get used to it but there are still a few extra steps in there that shouldn’t be. If you can’t see your waypoints, etc. when you’re walking, it’s because you’ve accidentally toggled it off in your option wheel. It took me too long to figure that out and turn it back on. 

(By the way, I find it kind of ironic that to craft a gas mask, you need to kill a stinkbug, which hurts you with stink gas). 

Overall, I feel like the game could get a little repetitive and therefore boring just because of all the crafting, but so far it’s been pretty fun.",1701560771,1702223094,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

When the game actually works, it's mostly pretty fun. However there are so many frequent problems with it despite already being a year old, I doubt those will be fully fixed.
Just off the top of my head, here's a list of some problems:
* The host has significantly lower FPS (I had 40-60 as host, 120+ as client)
* Objects desync as client (you see stuff that you can't interact with, because it doesn't exist on the host's end)
* As a client the HUD element indicating that a collectible is nearby sometimes glitches out, permanently showing that something is nearby, no matter how far you move away
* Sometimes really glitchy physics as client (likely due to desync)
* Individual players getting disconnected from the game (not an internet problem)
* All (non-host) players getting disconnected from the game (once again, not an internet problem). During some sessions it happened on average every 30 minutes, other times it was completely fine
* Game crashes/freezes
* Tutorials only appear for the host
* Some things/mechanics are never explained (as far as I can tell)
* A certain mid to lategame mechanic is broken: [spoiler]The Waft Emitter, which can be used to make creatures attack your base, can't spawn certain creatures that it should be able to. This is not intended because according to reddit posts it worked prior to the 1.3 update. It also oftentimes just despawns the creatures because they can't find their way to the Waft Emitter, leading you to basically get scammed out of your resources[/spoiler]
* Your menus are affected by other players doing stuff in their menus, which can lead to you crafting the wrong thing and just generally an annoying and sometimes confusing menu navigation
* Crafting something with a full inventory drops the crafted item on the ground, but if you do it this way it won't register for quest progress

I came up with this list in a few minutes, there's likely quite a few more problems I'd remember if I gave it some more time.

And then to top it all off it requires an Xbox account and if you care about 100%ing this game, you will likely have to grind a lot because each enemy can drop a certain thing but it's super rare: [spoiler]for most enemies it's a 1% chance to get their golden card and you need all of them. Of some enemies there are only 1-5 on the entire map and it takes multiple ingame days for them to respawn[/spoiler].",1700767717,1702164475,False,5,0,0.493255615234375,0,True,False,False

But even were you not to get stuck on pieces of terrain constantly, the game in general just does not having anything going for it to set it apart from other games in this genre other than its Honey I Shrunk the Kids premise, the novelty of which quickly fades when you're subject to hour after hour of running back and forth between places collecting small amounts of resources all the while facing off the ""dangers"" of the garden. The enemies themselves pose a little threat, and are unlikely to kill you in any single combat. However you cannot really run from them very often, and so you must continuously engage in battles with boring bugs for the nth time. I do not understand why this genre has chosen to focus so much on the combat aspect, when combat is just clunkily clicking left click at things and then blocking while you whittle down your opponent.

The premise of the game should have just been, you get shrunk and have to survive.  The whole find this hidden shrunken lab in the middle of a hedge is annoying and boring. 
I would recommend playing with other people. I didn't really enjoy my short 3 hours alone. 
Would still recommend valheim over this, but this is probably number 2, just because the others are pretty awful....(ps, I haven't played any of green hell, the forest, or sons of the forest, but I have played v rising, conan exiles, and probably another that I am forgetting).

I'm now editing this review after adding an extra 100 hours in about a month, and about a year or 2 after my original review. So here it is.

Game?  Absolutely Amazing. Spiders? Still effing Terrifying. Arachnophobia mode? STILL Some how more off putting than the spiders. 10/10 would ABSOLUTELY recommend to anyone that like survival crafting games, or games that lets you build ridiculous structures and bases. I never thought I would come back to this game and now be on a mission to 100% it outside of the misc. collectibles. Its so fun and charming, and the builds you can have are absolutely silly. I will say though, theres a specific octo-pedaled boss that gives me the heebie-jeebies and I hope I get its gold card sooner rather than later. Play this damn game.

I've never been a huge fan of Obsidian's work...but they hit the nail right on the head with this game.
This game seems pretty well balanced in all areas, the combat system is really good, the building is good.
Honestly there are only 2 things that I can think of that need improvement...they NEED to give you information about the gear...all of the gear has a lot of stats and buffs and such...it's all very important too, but they don't tell you anything about it within the game and forces you to go to the stupid wiki page for everything.
They really really need to include more information about this in the game because i don't like stopping game play every half hour to alt-tab and read for 5 minutes about gear or the gear upgrade or gear perks.
Also there are some really significant desync bugs in multiplayer that forces constant restarts on both the server and client side. these bugs are very frequent and frustrating because it is game breaking and forces everyone to stop playing and restart the game every hour or so.
but aside from those 2 things - this game is very solid and worth buying, i'd recommend to anyone that enjoys this genre of game.",1701731024,1701731024,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Amazing Survival game to play with friends. Everything feels exactly how you'd expect, massive, too scale and lots of locations to explore. 
Tons of enemy bugs, spiders, items to craft, materials to collect and bases to create to keep yourself and your team safe. 
There's an actually well thought out story to uncover that feels very in theme with this style of game where most others just have it as a side note really. 
Great graphic style and very addicting. 

My only gripe would be the game does NOT help you... at all. I don't expect any hand holding when it comes to fighting enemies or surviving but the story objectives don't tell you if you need anything to be able to progress and by the time you do get there you just straight up cannot do it because you missed a random item you needed to craft and have to go all the way back to base. Luckily... Google exists.

-------------

Grounded is effectively a multiplayer survival game of ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"". It's well optimised, the building system is polished and it's really immersive to play in. There are tons of building pieces which should make some interesting possibilities for bases. The garden world is pretty huge, hand crafted and full of interesting things to find. At such a small scale, it's really interesting to walk among the dirt, seeing grass stalks as high as trees. There's also tons of verticality; you can climb grass stalks, get high up to get a better view of your surroundings, delve into an ant hill and go diving in the pond. There's also loads of weapon and armour sets to make from bug parts.

[b]Pros[/b]
- Gorgeous, especially the lighting
- The design of the game world is impeccable. You can climb tall things to get a better view, landmarks are useful for navigating etc
- Bugs interact with each other. Bombardiers attack groups of ants. Ants attack weevils.
- There's a blueprint system for planning buildings in advance
- When you throw a spear at a creature, it gets stuck in it
- Really cool hand-crafted map to explore
- There are landmarks scattered around the garden which are great to explore as a tiny person
- You can craft armour out of bugs
- Huge attention to detail. You can climb a stalk of grass at night and watch them all wave gently in the wind
- There's a big pond with lots of underwater things to explore
- You can 'peep' a creature by looking at it while pretending to have binoculars, and it adds that creature's weaknesses to a database
- You unlock special powers (mutations) by performing feats like exploration and killing certain enemies a lot
- There are tons of decor items. One of them is an armour stand that lets you quick-swap the equipped set it's wearing
- You can relocate buildings at any time so you don't lose building materials
- You can quick-drop your inventory into nearby chests

[b]Cons[/b]
- It uses Microsoft instead of Steam for multiplayer, which is a genuinely shitty interface for playing together. Once you eventually manage to add each other as friends (which, unintuitively you do by 'following' each other), it took us a while to work out how to stop hearing everyone twice.
- Pathing could be better. Creatures get stuck in large objects or underneath bases or teleport around them
- The sleep cycle feels a bit broken. The game is dark by 7pm, but if you sleep then, the game warns you that you'll wake up at 3am as you always sleep for exactly 8 hours. You should be able to change the time you're going to wake up
- Major problems getting the game's audio to work as an output-only device with AirPods (because the game switches to ""communication mode"" even if you disable voice comms)
- No button to auto-sort inventory
- Whenever you quick-drop your inventory, it will add anything from your inventory to a nearby chest. Which is great, except that it also does it for weapons and arrows so I keep leaving the base with no ammo. Should be able to favourite items you never want to quick-sort
- You can place markers, but you can't label them - only symbols. I have to have a text editor open next to the game so I know what all the random symbols are
- Your thirst and hunger reset to about 30% every time you sleep, regardless of how full or empty you were when you went to bed, which makes eating in the afternoon or evening mostly pointless
- Personally I don't think it makes much sense that you need tier 2 bug parts to make tier 2 weapons. That means you need to kill tier 2 creatures with tier 1 weapons and armour to advance
- There aren't enough hotkeys or way to access tools. There are 8 hotbar slots. I have 7 tools, 4 different weapons, and 3 different kinds of healing consumables.
- The combat is the biggest weak point. Your attacks are 3-hit combos, but your attacks don't interrupt the enemy, so they usually attack you during your combo. Bugs can charge you through solid objects. Bugs teleport around things if you run away. Spiders can kill you in 2-3 hits even if you're just running away.

[b]Wishlist from Early Access[/b]
- Weather. Rain would be awesome
- Some kind of building to explore. I guess the house is ambitious, but there's a shed in the garden
- Custom characters and clothing customisation
- Some sort of power system for lighting using a battery for power
- More traps for defense",1596186267,1701620184,True,3,0,0.510677814483642578,0,True,False,False

I'm not sure I could write a review that would do this game justice. So fun. Nothing feels like a grind because all resource stuff has fairly immediate purpose. While there isn't a standard leveling system, the attributes, mutations and better gear combine to make it a rich skill progression. There's a fair variety of weapons and gear so each person can forge their own play style. Since it's not character based leveling as well, you can switch out gear and mutations to adopt different styles/weapons/approaches to different situations. Fun combat. The devs...I just can't say enough. There is a single bug when playing co-op where the non-host has trouble picking up water droplets. Other than that, this game has not felt broken or buggy once. The devs didn't sit on their hands; each major update has been filled with new and amazing content. This should have been nom'd for game of the year but it felt like it just didn't get the attention it deserved. The campaign is extensive with a great story line.

There's not much interesting about the garden. It's very small (unironically), you're able to traverse one end to the other within a 5 minute traipse. There's a very small diversity of insects from what I've seen so far, and I have very little motivation to seek the rest if there are any. You have the different type of ants (workers, warriors etc), small spider, big spider, mites and stinkbugs. I also instantly got murdered by a mosquito so that was nice. 85% of the garden is just grass (or dried grass). Haven't been in any nests yet, but again, I have no motivation to do so because what's the point? 

My dislike is probably centered around the fact that base building is just so inconvenient. It's a chore to make a 6 by 6 square let alone an actual flourishing little cradle to call home. I can't even make a window without going to the other end of the garden and back. Unlike other survival games, you need to lug around massive blades of grass - you can't fit them into your bag for later and call it a day. And I do see why they've made it like this to suit the theme of being small, but gameplay should never be sacrificed in favour of the backdrop and that's what the game has felt like for me so far.

Don't be fooled by the impressive builds you see in screenshots because as far as I can tell unless they spent hundreds of hours in that save (you're a better man than me...), they were probably made in creative mode.

That said I don't mean to paint the game as being all bad. There are a few things that are quite impressive but I'll let the other 90%+ other very positive reviews do the talking.",1701537627,1701539017,False,1,0,0.480158746242523193,0,True,False,False

I was all primed for it - the premise is right up my alley, like a great 80s kid-caper sci-fi movie, and the graphics are indeed gorgeous and everything you'd want out of this game.  It's fun just to load it up and look around.  The problem is, it doesn't know what kind of game it wants to be, so it tries to be several types and fails at all of them.  Is it an FPS?  Is it an RPG?  Is it a crafter and builder?  Is it an MMORPG?  Who can say?  Only the game designers, who tried to blend all these game types and more together and ended up with a mess that's just plain frustrating to play and not fun at all.  It's not that it's a bad game, and it's not that it's a hard game, it's that it's an unfair game that frankly just expects too much out of the player, and in the end, for all the fun I wanted to have with it, I found myself just getting angry with it and not having any fun at all.  And yes, it was punishingly hard, making it even more frustrating.  So I stopped playing.  And that's the worst, buying a game and expecting to like it, wanting to like it, and finding out that you just plain don't.

I plan to give it a try again some day.  Maybe I just didn't ""get it"", and wasn't ready to get it.  Now that I've played it a bunch and I know exactly what to expect, maybe I'd have a better time with a restart.  It has such great potential!  But my first experience with it wasn't great, and first impressions can be hard to break.  

Extra Note:  this game is virtually impossible to play effectively without resorting to the online Wiki, which isn't necessarily a problem in and of itself, I like looking up the Wiki for lots of games.  But this game absolutely requires it, or there is stuff you simply will never figure out on your own.  Devs, that's always a bad sign in my book.  The game itself should tell me everything I need to know - not every winning strategy or best way to do something, but everything I need to KNOW.  In this game, several times I got stuck and could go no further without looking things up, because I couldn't for the life of me figure out some essential mechanic or didn't realize what I was really going up against.  That's just plain bad game design.

Although I did enjoy the gameplay and the story, I’ve now played for almost 100 hours and have started working on the achievements of the game. When I first started, I didn’t know what I got myself into. There is A LOT of collectibles in this game you have to get for an achievement, which is tiresome in itself, but doable. BUT there is an achievement that requires you to «peep» every creature (fair enough if you’re playing through the game since you meet 90% somewhere through the main story). This achievement was recently changed into getting a GOLD CARD of every creature. Mind you, this gold card only has a 1% drop chance (except certain bosses). The bad thing about this is that you can end up getting it on 1 kill or 100+. Imo this is just an achievement they changed to make people play the game for longer, but it adds no purpose to the game… it shouldnt matter if you fight a boss 1 or 50 times just for an achievement…",1701388630,1701388630,False,1,1,0.485733240842819214,0,True,False,False

It has the usual ones, like collecting all the collectables (both cosmetic and base-stat increasing ones, all placed in exciting places that leave you happy you have been there), visiting all the landmarks (there are so many landmarks, which look both beautiful and unique with the game's miniature perspective), and killing all the bosses (which most are optional but all are tough, and I enjoyed them all (except for IBM but whatever)).
But then comes the Creature Cards. Every creature has a Basic card, which you get on your first encounter with that creature, and a Golden card, which you get after a random number of kills. The chance to get a GC (gold card) from normal creatures is 1% and from repeatable bosses 10% (and 5% for IBM despite it being the most bull boss of them all but whatever). Now, when the creature is small and comes in groups of 5-10, getting the GC is easy enough, even if RNGesus says you have to kill hundreds of them. But when that creature is one that you need endgame gear to kill without treating it like a boss encounter, wanders around alone in three spots in the entire map, takes three in-game days to respawn, and the chance for a GC is still 1%? Yeah, f that.
I spent 109 hours on a single save, and that is the one thing that prevents me from 100%-ing the game.
I love this game, but ffs, please fix that.

-----------------------------------------------
At first I really liked this game. I liked the art style, the setting, and the base building mechanic-- it reminds me of [i]The Forest[/i], but without the cannibal mutants pestering you. I really wanted to keep playing.
But... sadly I have two dislikes, and these dislikes are my personal rant/opinion. Send me all the Jesters you want if you can't stand it.

[b]1.[/b] After progressing to finding the first lab and being told where to go, I feel my progression has been halted by two things.
[b]-1a.[/b] The game doesn't tell the player where to get the items to acquire Tier II tools/weapons/armor. I get the hate when tutorials hand hold you too much, but some direction would be nice (instead of being forced to go to the wiki.. which it might not even tell you if the item has a rare drop rate or not).
[b]-1b.[/b] 'Perfect Blocking' (aka react as if you're playing Elden Ring) should not feel like a requirement to survive higher level enemies. But when trying to find a video to explain how I could possibly play my way (aka button mashing).. it doesn't exist. All I see is ""git gud with fast reaction blocking, or die (repeatably) and corpse walk to get your inventory back"". Look, I'm sure this mechanic is fun for a lot of people, but it's just not for me.

[b]2.[/b] Achievements, are locked behind an Xbox account. When I looked on Google for a ""WHY IS THIS A THING?!"" answer, I got nothing. Multiplayer locked behind an account (to me), is fine; I'll let that slide. But locking [b]achievements[/b] on Steam?! ...Is this a PC port (and this game was originally on the Xbox)?

 - Travel gets annoying mid-late game. At least it impedes fun for me.
 - Wasp drones are just broke. Forced ranged. They never get close and heal themselves. In particular I don't like being forced into ranged play. They're doable, but also very not fun.
 - Smoothies impede the flow of the game a lot. Waiting on muscle sprouts to grow. I did start a farm but still slow. I don't like the lillypad wax on the stamina potions change either. Time gates things a lot more.
 - Would like the ability to plant things without opening a menu, quick plant. Or perhaps even if you leave a muscle sprout in a plot, harvest one, the one harvested grows back if the other is left there.
 - The hot tub heal seems unnecessarily slow.
 - After 1.3 all my ""bounce pads"" are ever so slightly messed up.
 - Infected broodmother isn't fun. Mild is way to easy. Medium is MASSIVELY different then mild. There is no inbetween. Neither feels good. Neither is fun. Particularly the potion debuff is a problem that makes phase 3 impossible.",1596009196,1701065808,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

The unique setting of having common back garden insects and objects being your challenges and opponents forces you to use creativity in the way you complete objectives and take down some of the games bigger foes.

Pros
The crafting system, upgrade and character screen options generally are easily explained and easy to use.
The wonder of wandering around the back garden is both exciting and frightening as some of the enemies in the game are really powerful and therefore night is truly a scary point if you stay awake.
Building a base is not just a building experience, you do require your base for some of the larger crafting tables and some of the craftable items ensure survival is easier.
You can choose custom game settings.

Cons
While I love the game there definitely are some cons.
Despite the game being playable by a single player, the difficulty level, even at Mild, is very difficult.  Some enemies which are camped out very near your first regular stop location are some of the most difficult in the game.  Certain enemy types are so numerous there was clearly a specific weapon type in mind as there are 3 different varieties of weapons with the same perk.  Like a lot of co-op games, survival by a single player was not really considered. If you manage to make it to the point where you're incredibly powerful and well yoked, it's likely that the final sequence of the game is way too much for most players to tackle on their own.
As you cannot unlock certain recipes until you have researched at least some of the items required to create them, exploration of certain areas (specifically the pond and any other water areas which require swimming) can be incredibly difficult to explore and gain access to the recipes.  That said, Brainpower leveling does open up some recipes for you, I'm just not sure that any swimming related assistance items are actually included in this.

All in all, the game is definitely worth it and a much better experience if you're playing with more than one other player.  Personally I love the game and while early game can be frustrating, you will beef yourself up with good weapons and armour and perks to make the game feel a bit more fair but the difficulty level can be brutal so, despite the age of the protagonists, younger kids not used to action adventure games might have difficulty with this one. With the full release came a good guide to get you to the most important locations and an introduction as to how to unlock certain items.  However I would stress that this was not released with a single player in mind.  Enemies surround you in far too great numbers, damage dealt by even the smallest enemies can prove catastrophic in only a few hits, so if you're surrounded, you will likely die.  I think that instead of immediately opening up the 'Playground' as their first major patch, Obsidian should really work on a bit more balancing.  Some enemies have astronomical health levels and not only no weaknesses, but they resist most damage types and spawn with adds.  Hopefully they'll fix this and I am looking forward to any DLC the game might offer to provide more enjoyment out of the story mode of the game :)",1645003555,1701037625,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The main character is the game world. So many nooks and crannies (literally) to explore. There's a constant sense of adventure every time you venture into the unknown. Or even when visiting familiar places. And with the additions that you unlock along the way the grinding and traversing gets easier making for a pretty smooth ride in the backyard.

The story unfolds nicely throughout and leads you from one end of the map to the other. And you'll be amazed at how big it is. Getting to a high place and looking around you'll realize just how much there is to see. And it has that almost perfectly balanced sense of monster progression where you can go many places, but some places are simply too dangerous until later in the game. I love that.

The only downside to the game that I can think of is that once you've completed the game and seen it all (which will take you ~100 hours) there's not much incentive to go back unless you just want to build bases in creative mode. Base-building is a lot of fun. And you will grow to love your base wherever you decide to put it. But it's not enough of an incentive to keep playing for me personally.

So my recommendation is not to rush the game! Take your time. Make sure you explore it all. There's more than you think. It's not just what you can see on the ground. There's a LOT of hidden places as well. And then some.

10/10 incredible game.

I do however not like how underwhelming an assassin type build is, which is my ideal build, as gathering the materials is a pretty daunting task and the reward for it just doesn't seem worth it. The only change I would like to do related to this is to buff the ""Coup De Grass"" mutation as it only creates a 5% critical hit chance. The crit chance can only go up to max of about 15% without very temporary buffs such as the assassin armor buff and the infected water buff.

The cartoony style was a great decision to avoid being overly disturbing for people that dislike bugs, while also having a great charm.
The story is nice and the game allows for both funny and scary moments at the same time, which make it a great experience.

Content-wise, it has a lot to do right now and collectables to grind, with hopefully more content in the future. Sadly, it does not allows for mods at this time, although they just added the custom maps mode, which is a good start.

A great feature of this game is the shared world mechanic, that allows any of your friends to host the game, sharing any progress they make, which is great compared to other games where you depend on the person that created the world to get online to play.

As players are zapped into miniature form, they find themselves exploring a vast backyard straight out of the 90s. The encompassing experience involves piecing together makeshift tools, weapons, armour, constructing shelters/bases, and collecting food and water. I had a great time creating a network of flying foxes for easy traversal around the backyard, establishing mini-bases as safe havens from the bugs only so that i can go deeper into the backyard and further explore this delightful game. 

Certain armor and weapons work better on certain enemies, so it's imperative for you to kill all kinds of bugs and collect various resources to be scanned into your database to see what you can make from them. The weapons and armor sets are quite diverse, allowing you to explore various build types. Furthermore, you're encouraged to find molars scattered around the backyard for permanent character stat upgrades like HP and Stamina. There is a story to discover about why you have been shrunken down, a friendly robot named BURG.L helping you, and miniature science labs throughout the backyard.

After actually playing the game I lost interest around the 30-40 hour mark. Truth is everything became to grindy. Nighttime sucks. The world is huge but takes years just to get places. The huge wall that surrounds majority of the map is annoying too. Yes you can build your way around it but honestly but trying to find a way up is really annoying. Alot of other things are mediocre...and theres nothing excited about progressing anymore. You feel like youve done in all at that point.

Its obviously a gorgeous game and really cool idea, but it really sucks to see it go to waste by a tedious survival build system.",1671948422,1700946495,False,0,0,0.481314867734909058,0,True,False,False

Unfortunately this game is filled with just tedious game systems which have no fun elements to it. Who wants to go look for water every 10 minutes? Really? And you can't automate rain water collection either...

Then there's the mats you grinded hours for to build you base, and more than half of them getting deleted because you want to rearrange a wall, while other games return 100% of the mats when you deconstruct.

Due to the level of devotion the devs have continued to show this game, fixing problems that caused people like me frustration. Continuing to add new content and care about their player base, I think I can safely say that I would recommend this game. I recently got the urge to come back to it and was very pleased. Maybe its the distance between my original review and getting the urge to play the game again, realizing I was being unfair in my review.

----old review----
I have played this game for a while, over 200 hours. I loved this game during early access and even during my time replaying the old content, overall its still a really fun concept. However, as time went on the game gets old and the fun from the beginning turns into repetition, grind and tedium. It started to feel like a second job just to gather enough supplies to be geared up for the final parts of the game. 

Lets first talk pros before I go into my list of cons:
 - Really fun concept
 - base building is really good, in line with games like the Forest
 - Creatures look realistic with a bit of that cartoonish fun added to them
 - The game has that good survival feel and I love that basically anywhere on the map could be a roaming scary wolf spider patrolling through (I like that even the starter area isn't safe. 
 - Story was okay, good enough for a mostly survival game
 - voice acting was really good, and I'm a sucker for anything Zachary Levi does
 - I will admit until I got to the 1.0 content I was really enjoying my time in this game

Now lets talk cons:
 - The Inventory, god the stupid inventory - holy crap the INVENTORY. One of the most annoying and limiting factors in any game I've ever encountered. No possibility to upgrade later, (don't talk to me about pets, I'll get to those later....) This inventory system which is basically an exercise in irritating the player, just to make the game take longer.... Heck I turned off weapon and tool decay just so I didn't have to carry around repair supplies.... didn't help much. The UI EVEN has an empty row at the bottom where they could have fit 10 more slots..... Oh and the whole removing your active items from inventory while you're using them, and getting the inevitable ""you can't unequip this item your backpack is full"" message, SUPER ^@#$ing irritating. Why on earth the devs think their inventory system is good, I will never know, but THATS OKAY THEY GAVE US A DANG SORT BUTTON.....finally. For a game based on progression and getting stronger to survive, not having an upgradeable backpack system is just bonkers to me. Get used to saying ""gotta run all the way back to base now, my inventory is full... again"" every 5-10 minutes. 

 - Next lets talk about progression.... what progression? Sure you get stronger for the area you're in at first. But there is a point in the game, where all of the good weapons barely make you break even on difficulty, unless you go and farm bosses or really difficult enemies with ridiculously low drop rates.... If you're playing a survival game you WANT/NEED to feel like you're getting stronger by the end, not spending hours on end grinding to just barely scrape by.. I get the game should be hard, but come on, its a game and players like to feel like their hard work has paid off. 

 - Upgrades.... NOT ENOUGH ITEMS, there are not enough resources on the map if you want to upgrade lots of items, or try out new ones. Make the upgrade resources respawn, and making the player have to wait till basically the very end of the game to craft high tier upgrade materials is just stupid, oh and spoilers...[spoiler](it barely gives you a hint on where to go if you want to get the blueprints for them as its optional, but required for the second ending) [/spoiler]

 - Pets.... buggy little bugs... They can't be picked up to move them where you want, their follow AI sucks, I can't even get them to follow me into my base so I can keep them safe. However, you want to have one because its the only way to get 10 extra inventory slots in the most immersion breaking way possible, (devs if you nerf this next part without fixing your terrible inventory system......yeah, just fix the inventory....). Yep, you can keep the pet anywhere on the map, and still push items to its inventory. I trapped an aphid in the mysterious machine just so I'd have extra slots, because warping items to a pet miles (meters) away on the map isn't immersion breaking, but giving upgrades to your inventory is just bad bad bad..... come on get real. There are plenty of resources in the game that you could make a hip pouch or something to increase available space.... or make a quiver to get arrows out of your inventory, SOMETHING better than glitchy pets.

 - Now lets talk about 1.0 release. Everything about the upper yard and final endgame feels rushed. You're only going to be exploring three quarters of the entire yard if you follow the story prompts. The only way to find all the different things is to just wander aimlessly and discover the other areas, and I guarantee you miss a lot of them without help from the internet. There was so much cut content from the feature board. No weather like they wanted to add (really really hoped we'd get this because over time the world feels bland and just same old same old. I know I know, rain would be EXTREMELY hard to figure out because of how big the player is and bases would likely get destroyed if you weren't smart about it, but I still think it was worth trying to figure this out). Only two optional bosses, I don't count the termite king, which should have been required by story in my opinion. They clickbaited me with putting nothing in the milk carton, still salty about that. The game just doesn't feel complete, like a whole bunch of stuff just left out and the story rushed to release because management said they needed to release, typical BS with large companies like Microsoft. They had a whole treasure trove of content that could have made the cut, but was just simply left out and the game just kinda ends...

 - Lastly, because I think I've rambled long enough, its certainly not everything I feel about the game, lets talk about the hotfixes after 1.0 release..... they suck. The devs have nerfed every fun thing about the game. Find a weapon I like... nerfed in next hotfix, but they buff the really useless crap that no one uses, or the really difficult to acquire stuff... STOP NERFING FUN THINGS #justicefortickmacuahuitl. Restore all the poison builds, tick sword, and other fun things you nerfed to their former 1.0 glory, and only buff the ones you want people to use more. Stop taking the fun out of it, this is a PVE game, there is no need to constantly nerf the fun weapons just to keep people from using them as a meta strategy. This 1.0.4 hotfix really killed the game for me, PVE doesn't need nerfs, there's no need to balance the game this hard, unless something is severely broken and not working properly, its not a PVP game, balances like they've been pushing out are so frustrating. 

- oh and the final fight, is severely not balanced for solo play on medium and woah, and the OPTIONAL boss at the end has a game breaking bug that causes your frames to drop to like 10 while fighting it on some machines. Gas arrows also seem to kill frames as well, and I have a RTX 2080 with an i9 and 32gb of memory, this computer can slay games like Cyberpunk, but particle effects in Grounded just murder it. 

Okay, rant over... thanks to the dev's 1.0.4 hotfix, I decided I'm over this game, I still wanted to complete it, I'd spent way too much time in it not to, but I was just kinda done. So I turned the game on Mild, switched off hunger and thirst, and speed ran all the final content just to get through the story and end my time in the backyard. I'm over it, and I don't think I'll be returning unless the devs were to seriously reconsider a LOT of things like I've mentioned above.",1666531174,1700922051,True,0,0,0.708532154560089111,0,True,False,False

(good things) this game never really gets boring, there is multiple side missions or side things you can do, like complete some quests, or get the milk molars, or get the cards and fill out your handbook.
fighting and pvp aren't terrible as some other games and each enemy has their own unique ability to make it interesting. there is hidden easter eggs throughout the map that you can find and a variety of weapons you can choose from. 
(bad things), getting the cards, inside the game if you find a enemy you can ""peep"" the enemy which marks it in your book and you can look at the picture of the insect, and it will give you a description of it, but some insects don't respawn, so if you forget to peep it you will be left with a empty space in your book and there is no way to get the card, some bosses also only spawn once so if you forget to peep it, again you won't be able to get the card again. (golden cards), these cards you get from killing so many of one insect, it's not numbers it's probability, most regular insects you have a 1 percent chance to get a gold card, and some bosses (excluding the bosses that only spawn once), will usually have a chance of 10 percent for a gold card, but this one ""boss"" called termite king, which sounds like a boss and acts like a boss and requires boss things, only has a 1 percent chance to drop the golden card, and if you kill him you have to wait another 3.5 hours in real time to try again, this took me like multiple weeks to get it. other annoying things are the puzzles throughout the game, building, and finally the final mission before you complete the story line. this game I would give a 8.9 out of 10 a lot of good things and a few bad things, overall very recommended.",1700867934,1700867934,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Although, unlike Subnautica, there's a heavy emphasis on combat with any creatures you encounter. Everything is either a meal on wheels or it has the parts you need to construct a base, armor, weapons, or anything else.

I find the end game isn't quite as satisfying or diverse as the beginning. Later areas don't feel quite as alive or with the depth of critters as the early game. Many times, they feel like trumped up versions of what you already found before (like a ladybug and a ladybird).

Still, there's tons of variety. And the small team of developers continue to update the game after the 1.0 launch. No major new areas, but new critters to fight and new bosses.

The scenery is breathtaking, especially when you get a good overhead view and and compare what the backyard really looks like (it's pretty small), compared to what it feels like when you are down there in the muck (it seems vast).  
Sound quality is also excellent, and you can really rely on audio cues for everything from avoiding the most dangerous foes in the early game, to timing your perfect blocks.

I definitely would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of survival/craft/base-building games.   If you like your survival games 'hard' and play this on the highest difficulty options it definitely delivers an experience far better than most survival games do for us gluttons for punishment.

Gabe newell once said ""Piracy is a service issue"" and this is a good case for that. At 119 hours in I'm not digging the new update at all, and I have no recourse to roll it back. Honestly its another bad move by xbox game studios and honestly they are so close to being on my ban list (Like EA, Ubisoft, Blizzard) that this isn't that shocking.  Really disappointed and going to Hail Mary for a refund even after 120 hours. Its just not worth the time to deal with devs constantly changing the experience for no reason or to meet some sort of vision that I really don't care about. I was having fun, Keyword: WAS

 I appreciate that out of all survival games I was able to make Grounded a super painless experience which was good for a simple relaxing time or playing with friends who have very limited or poor FPS skills. If i wanted a tougher time at all id play literally anything else on the market. Even in the space of arcadey survival games it faces titans like Subnautica, and even they botched their sequel. 

The new content is good quality but over balance changing this late in the game is obtrusive. I had the same problem with Cyberpunk but at least in that case CDProjektRed had the foresight to add the 1.6 patch to the betas list for players to roll back. I hated the perk and combat reblance but I was easily able to go back to the experience I enjoyed.

Honestly I play Grounded to shut my brain off and chill out. If i wanted restrictions on base building, 4 second delays on healing, among other changes then I would play something else. Which is what I'm going to have to do. 

Hope all who continue to play have fun but this is my stop and time to get off this game.

No ""human blood and guts"", but still if you think about it, it is scary as the thought of being hunted by spiders dawns on you.

pros:
- a visual delight - the lighting!!! every time of day is so gorgeous!!!
- base building is easy for new players but has a high ceiling for what you can accomplish
- super cohesive art design, all the bugs are adorable and stylised really nicely
- ACCESSIBILITY TOOLS!! arachnophobia safe mode (as a slider with different levels to pick from) as well as a text to speech function for easier communication 
- lighthearted storytelling that delivers a fun narrative to follow. the kids are all really endearing and its fun to hear them banter with each other 

cons:
- multiplayer goes through xbox/microsoft so you do need an account with them even when playing on Steam. Connection can be a bit wobbly at times
- perfect blocking is really important in combat and aforementioned wobbly multiplayer connection can make that very difficult with any kind of latency 
- Cannot make a telescope with a dew drop and piece of grass like in A Bugs Life, stuck only using my feeble human hands to peep",1700629762,1700629762,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I haven’t yet finished the game as of writing this review, but I expect to spend many more hours exploring this cool tiny world and seeing what new adventures it will take me on.

It's a genre of games with a really big range of quality, plus a whole lot of ever-present jank. Sometimes they're good, even really good. Other times they're not so good.

Grounded is unique in that it's great.

Never before have I played a survival game with so much character and so much quality. It's certainly not perfect, the jank is certainly there (it's Obsidian, what did you expect?), but it does so so many things right (it's Obsidian, what did you expect?). The characters are all fun and unique and I love hearing them interact with each other, plus the audio logs are all campy and wonderful. It's the first game I've played that made first-person melee combat fun and interesting. It gives you so much freedom to fuck around and find out, and yet its several areas, bosses, and ""dungeons"" give a really nice feeling of progression.

I could sit here and list all the flaws I can come up with if I really wanted to, but that would be a waste of my time and yours. Looking at games like they're a collection of specifications to be compared rather than pieces of art to be admired is dumb and stupid. Just play Grounded, it's amazing.

And yet here we are, with a unique survival game of it's own. Obviously this screams 'Honey, I Shrunk the Kids', has a very cartoon appearance and seems to be inspired and / or set in the 80's. Make no mistake though, this game can be punishing for the unprepared. The thought of trying to survive a backyard where the spiders triple your size is enticing enough. I want to say I started my adventure shortly after the Koi Pond update. I've watched this game continuously expand and grow since then at an alarming pace. Lots of love has been poured into this game, and appears to have tons of room for more. For any survival / rpg fans - this is a winner with an enormous amount of things to do / craft / explore and imagine. Be careful out there.

Edit: After 1.0 release and a fresh world, I can say - easily one of the best survival games of all time. Please don't neglect this game - continue to update it, it has so much potential and can be such an awesome experience. Nominate this for Game of the Year or Labor of Love. It deserves it!

And comparing it to Subnautica is surprisingly apt, as you find yourself stuck in an alien environment with terrifying threats that, if you want to advance the story and unlock better gear, you will be forced to face head first.

However, there’s one crucial detail that Grounded provides that Subnautica lacks: You are encouraged to test the wilds together with some friends! And it makes a huge difference. There is more of a dungeon-crawling aspect to the game once you have a party going, and defeating the daunting terrors of the yard becomes a grand adventure you forge onto together.

My friends and I have sunk a good number of hours into the game already, but it’s clear that we’re still far from the finish line, and I look forward to every opportunity we get to continue our escapade. Be it facing lowly ants, imposing stink bugs, or the absolutely terrifying spiders that the yard provides, I am far from sick of this romp.

Give it a go! But do it with some friends. It’s very lonely being shrunken down and stuck when you’re on your own.

This game is extremely fun by itself but with friends there are seemingly endless shenanigans to get into making this game re-playable many times over. A fun and interesting campaign as well as an art style that is unmatched for this game's genre. Another thing is the design of the weapons and buildings you see almost every component of the weapons in the model which I have never seen in my 2000+ hours of survival games. The combat is also amazing the way weapons and mutations work along with the responsiveness of the game makes the combat one of the best survival games.

Previously it was already tedious but they added that you have to have every golden creature card to achieve 100%. 
These are pretty rare cards that you can receive by killing a bug, and harvesting their remains. (according to the grounded wiki) , there is a 1% drop chance for a gold card with at base for ordinary creatures. As well as a 10% drop chance for repeatable bosses. This doesn't include the infected broodmother that has a lower drop chance. Which is already in my opinion the most annoying boss fight to do, as it has three phases.
In fact, the percentage drop for the infected broodmother is only 5%, (according to the grounded wiki) even though it is a repeatable boss. in my opinion this just completely ruins trying to grind for 100% on this game, and was completely unnecessary. 
Grinding for games shouldn't be so tedious that it makes you want to just quit because you might have spent multiple days just trying to get the creature cards needed.",1692129800,1700112647,False,2,1,0.493150681257247925,0,True,False,False

Original text: This game was great. But see my playtime? How long it is? at least 40% of that playtime was COMPLETELY WASTED and useless because they riddle the entire map with inaccessible objectives FROM THE START OF THE GAME that you can't even TOUCH until right before the END GAME. And we still haven't even finished the game yet, yet have only explored 4 set piece areas? So....basically...you start the game. Then it goes ""here's your main objectives! And some side objectives *if you wanna do them*! Have fun!"" but COMPLETELY DOESN'T TELL YOU THAT EVERY SINGLE SIDE OBJECTIVE IS INACCESSIBLE UNTIL AFTER EVERY MAIN OBJECTIVE HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED. 

Me and my bf spent 30-40 hours scouring the entire game world looking for ways to access these optional areas, but it turns out every single optional area is locked off by design until you've finished 4 out of 5 of the main quest objectives in the entire game. I had to find this out by Googling answers...I was really trying hard not to look anything up, too, but the game gives you zero information! My #1 rule for video games is DON'T WASTE MY TIME and despite how good this game is, I'm so annoyed how unclear they were about the objectives I'm not even going to recommend the whole thing.

DEVS: IF YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE ME AN OPEN WORLD CRAFTING GAME AND THEN FORCE ME TO EXPLORE IT IN THE SPECIFIC WAY YOU WANT ME TO, YOU GOTTA AT LEAST MAKE IT CRYSTAL CLEAR I HAVE NO ACTUAL CHOICES AND AM DOING IT WRONG IF I'M NOT FOLLOWING THE QUESTS!

P.s. the game takes a huge dive in general about 65% of the way through, as the whole northern area of the map seems to be designed as nothing but a time sink of endless tedious enemies, with any new bugs you need for upgrades specifically hidden in small areas you don't discover until you basically finish the game. So no exploration once again until you get those main quests done. 

They really phoned this game in after early access, IMO. Basically. It feels like they play tested the hell out of the first 30 hours to make sure it felt good for early access, then just shrugged and checked off content boxes and released the rest without even checking to make sure if it was fun. A waste of a really cool concept, really. Bummer.",1678822625,1700096190,False,1,1,0.31108933687210083,0,True,False,False

I was lured in by an imaginative, exploratory basebuilding game, but there's a lot of combat. And scarce options in the game settings to tweak that. Random base raids, enemy damage being all-or-nothing, and tightly integrated combat to the storyline make the game less appealing to a casual player like me. And while I appreciate the lack of glass walls - I can just build stairs up a wall if I spend enough time - repeatedly encountering a lab entrance that just says ""locked"" kills that vibe.

I can't recommend this game enough. I tend to get overwhelmed with survival craft games due to my ADHD because there is just too much to do and I experience choice paralysis. But with Grounded, I was always looking forward to the next thing. I had such fun with this game, I grinded out the 100% this last week.

[h1]THE GOOD AND THE FANTASTIC -[/h1]
- The games vibes are immaculate. It's the perfect rendition of a bunch of 80s kids getting shrunk down in a backyard and surviving using cartoon-ish science. The style of the game, the designs of the bugs, the music and ambient noise--it's perfect. Grounded achieves everything that it is trying to do and more.
- Amazing game progression. I never lost steam in the game because I always knew what I wanted to do next.
- ""Shared worlds"" (basically like Minecraft Realms) where your friends can log onto the world without you and push the save to the Microsoft servers. Anyone can then load the save and see what was built/achieved while they were gone.
- Fantastic combat system with a perfect parry system?! What the heck?! It's way too good.
- Crafting system where all the ingredients make cartoonish sense for what you're building.
- Unique and interesting builds and gameplay styles depending on your mutations, armor sets, and weapon choice.
- Unique dialogue depending on the characters that you play.
- The map is huge and full of surprises and things to discover. Unlike a lot of other survival craft games, the map of Grounded is NOT procedurally generated but hand-crafted. Every secret and collectable is placed with purpose.
- The best 3D base building I have ever experienced. It has all the QOL you could want from base building and also fun furniture options.

[h1]THE NOT-SO-GOOD -[/h1]
- My fellow arachnophobes, be careful... this game is gonna be real hard to get through...
- Because this is a multi-session kind of game, multiplayer connectivity and desync issues are going to happen.
- Very late game can be a bit of a slog to get through.
- Grounded is a shining example of a game that is incredibly fun to play through and beat but a horrible pain in the ass to 100%.

EDIT [11/15/2023] - Today, I saw that Grounded had a massive 1.3 edit that makes 100%ing the game much better and adds more difficulty options. When I played, there was no way to tell which SCA.Bs and Molars you already picked up which made it a huge chore. They revamped the map and added this information. Amazing... what did we do to deserve devs like these?

This game has been great fun. Me and a friend have regularly come back to it each time a new update has come out (we started playing when it was still relatively new as an early access game) and even though we normally get through the new content within, say, 2 weeks of casual play, we always continue for a while as there's always something to keep it enjoyable afterwards. 
I did find it got a bit old after a few playthroughs but that's to be expected, what isn't expected however is just how much Obsidian are doing with the game, I'm always impressed to see how much they add each time and after the last update I thought it would be the last. It's great to see a game company who actually care enough about their content to continue working on it and trying to ensure people can continue enjoying it even after release without simply pumping out overpriced DLC that barely adds anything to the game. I've reached out to them once about a bug which was the only time I had anything that was enough of an issue to take note of. And they not only replied quickly but also got it sorted just as fast. It was clear they actually took note of it too rather than throwing you through the normal loops you often get with larger franchise games, if they even bother responding which is really refreshing.",1700027691,1700027691,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Beside that the game is great. I would prefer dedicated Sever over this server mess between platforms (at least it was a good Idea).

The game is brilliant (Version 1.2.6). I think, this is the most enjoyable piece of Software since years. Everything looks pretty well thought out. The whole span of the story with it kinks and changes is great and not to much or to little, the variety and the side tasks never make the game a repetitive chore. The whole map is fantastic, with its countless lairs and dungeons, the treasure hunts, easter eggs, etc., in which you are almost automatically guided further and further by the story and tasks and where you can constantly make new discoveries and keep the game experience fresh. It is always challenging and exciting to venture into new areas. Surprises are waiting everywhere. The base building is nice and looks great, even the buffs you will get from it is a nice little addition. 
Fighting and movement works as it should be (omg, how many games could not bring these basic things together!?), all the Setting, the NPCs and Mobs are well done and have have their own behaviour pattern, in fights all readable. Fighting is challenging when playing Solo, the down scaling from multiplayer could be better, but that is not a real issue at all. The stamina system never gets in the way of fighting, it feels natural and fits perfectly (Hello Valheim!! Look here!).
Also the system with the mutations is awesome! The itemization is great and the need to plan your equipment for the next excursion makes this game even better. The Progress with Equipment through the tiers and the constantly increasing level of difficulty fits perfectly together. The User Interface works, the Quality of Life things like the automatic stashing of your inventory in your base, building and crafting auf of the stashes etc etc. Everything is working greatly. It's just that the few npc voice overs quickly becomes too repetitive.
If you like Valheim and never played Grounded: Instant downloed this game and you will know, what Valheim is missing (a good fight and movementsystem!)! Unbelievably, this game almost passed me by because the comic-like graphics and especially the publisher and X-Box bullshit put me off at first. I can not believe that there was not a bigger hype arround this little gem! Since the map is fixed and not procedural, the replay value isn't as high as in Valheim, but that's said while playing 2 playthroughs at once (one in group, one solo).
This is by far the best survival base builder I played (and I played a lot!) It is a VERY positive example of finished software and a great, well thought-out game, both in terms of story and game mechanics.

Grounded was a blast with enjoyable and mysterious adventure in a miniature world, offering a fascinating map and engaging gameplay. However, the experience takes an unexpected turn towards the end game. 

! Spoiler Warning !

[spoiler] Without clear warnings or guidance, players may find themselves at a critical juncture where they need to defend multiple locations simultaneously. This challenge becomes particularly daunting for solo players or even duos.

Turns out, building walls is key for defense, but there was no information or a hint was given earlier. Now, I'm getting bombarded by O.R.C bugs, and I can't even get to my base. Solo or even with a buddy, it's a struggle. Wish I knew about this madness before diving in. :)

I wanted to keep exploring, but these relentless attacks have me stuck. It's like, ""Let me enjoy the game, please!"" Grounded is awesome, but a heads-up on the defense thing would've been golden. Now, I'm just bug-swatting instead of having a good time exploring the rest of this tiny world.   [/spoiler]",1644792403,1699790968,True,0,0,0.577625095844268799,0,True,False,True

I started playing this game pretty much with all cheats enabled, because I wanted to get a feel for it. Within 10 minutes however, I started a new save that was MUCH more survival-based, simply because the world was so fun to explore and I wanted to get the full experience. 

This game feels a lot like ARK: Survival Evolved at first, with one of your first goals being the crafting of tools and establishment of a shelter, then figuring out how to stop AVOIDING all of the scary insects and spiders, and actually take them on (on purpose). The story of the game is pretty fun, and while a certain NPC can get pretty annoying at times, it's still a fun ride.

The thrill you get from your first spider take-down (and there are several varieties, meaning you get said thrill several times!) is unbelievable, like taking down a Souls boss for the first time. The combat can get a bit repetitive at times, and by the end of the game your inventory will likely remain constantly half-full of various weapons, simply because so many insects/creatures have very different weaknesses. The combat system has modifiers for basic things (piercing damage, blunt damage, chopping damage, etc.), in addition to 'elemental' damage types (think fire and ice damage, but with much more comical in-game implementation), so you can only be so-prepared to face various threats unless you account for a lot of possible encounters. 

The building aspect of the game is a lot of fun. If you want a relatively easy/fast progression, enabling and using your Handy Gnat can let you teleport your possessions AND yourself (claim a bedroll, move it somewhere else with your Gnat, enable 'keep-inventory', die, then respawn wherever your Gnat put the bedroll, even across the map) and you can cheese some pretty tough enemies if you're clever by building, but in the end the game is as hard as you want it to be. I really enjoy all of the customization options, though there are several missing construction shapes that would be really nice to have. Base construction absolutely takes up a good chunk of my play-time, because that's part of the game I really enjoy (Fallout 4, ARK: SE, Return to Moria, Satisfactory, Minecraft, base-building is fun!).

This game has actually made me more likely to take in my surroundings. I've started noticing the small details on the ground a lot more often since diving into this game, such as seeing an interesting mushroom formation and thinking about how a 1cm-tall person could parkour it. Taking walks with my dog has an additional fun aspect because of that!

As for difficulty, as mentioned earlier it's pretty much as hard as you want it to be. Now there are a few things that likely will take a few tries to get through (yes, there is an 'underwater level'), but in the end you can make it as easy or as hard as you want. And if your parkour skills aren't fantastic, well probably start practicing.

962130,149852217,76561197971544967,0,145,14626,0,14626,1699588848,"A survival game, where you explore the backyard of a house after being shrunken to roughly the size of an ant,  This is a very narrative focused survival game, much like Subnautica, but it has a huge amount of freedom as well.  It has the standard gathering, building, exploring aspects of other survival games, but the setting really gives it a unique feel.  Climbing grass, collecting dew, fighting roly-polys, etc is just not something you see everyday.  You will need to progress the story to move forward though.  The graphics are very cartoony, and the game starts out fairly easy, but don't let that fool you.  The game becomes very challenging and the backyard is huge with lots of things to keep you busy.

The main pros, to me, are the setting and the exploration aspect of the game.  There is a ton to explore, with new resources, new creatures and new biomes to challenge you.  I played this in 2022/2023, and there had been several very large content drops before I started playing, so older reviews may not reflect this.  The building lets you get creative and it is fairly easy to align and plan, though it can take a while to unlock that variety.  There are many types of weapons and armors to cater to many styles of combat.  The story kept me engaged but was a bit goofy and light-hearted for my tastes.  It is also co-op but I played 100% solo so no idea how well that is implemented.

The biggest cons, are the very consolely interface and the need to login to XBox to get achievements.  Huge text, radial menus, limited save locations and clunky menus.  Disappointing but you get used to it, and may be preferred by those playing on a TV or using controllers.  Beyond that, the game can get very difficult, too difficult in some places.  The final boss (which I think is optional) was a crazy, unfun battle and I needed to lower the difficulty for it (the only time).  Even on easy this battle was pretty crazy.  I don't want to spoil things so I won't go into details.  Maybe I could have beaten it on medium but I definitely would have needed to max out most of my equipment and built things like bombs which are tedious to make..  There are other bosses which I didn't bother to try and fight because I struggled enough with just normal enemies (wolf spiders, black widows, black ox beetles, etc).  This is partially me just not being great at the combat (I suck at perfect blocking), but I gather it will get daunting for most people in places.  Combat is also a bit clunky feeling, with most weapons being slow and you running out of stamina often.  Also, for my tastes, there was actually too much content.  The game was very good, but it got a bit tedious later in the game and I just wanted it to end after a while.  This is partly because of the difficulty, with many powerful bugs that are seemingly around every corner and the large distances that need to be traveled.  There is no fast travel but you can eventually build some things to help with moving around (mutations, equipment and zip lines).  The ziplines are great but it can take a lot of effort to set these up as there are so many things that get in the way.  I also like to explore and do most of the content, so I played longer than I needed to (didn't 100% the game or anything though).  Still only like 4% of people finished the game, so I don't think I'm alone.

It is a great game though, just be prepared to sink some real time into it if you want to finish it and unlock most of it's secrets.  If you just want a nice, relaxing diversion, it may not be what you want.",1699597273,1699597273,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

On the surface, Grounded contains all the normal elements of your everyday survival game. Manage hunger and hydration whilst you venture around the backyard, gathering resources to build your own camp whilst fighting off all manner of creatures that want to eat you. But it is so so much more than just this. Let's get into all the awesome things you can expect.

1. Biomes
On the surface of things, one may think ""How could you turn a backyard into a set of distinct and unique biomes?"" Well, Grounded does ALL of that, and so much more. Explore the undergrowth in the Grasslands, dive into the depths of a massive Koi Pond, navigate your way through the surprisingly labyrinthine branches of the Hedge, or try to survive the blistering heat of the Sandbox on your hunt for buried treasure. There are 16 unique biomes in the backyard, as well as many tunnels and dungeons to delve through, from anthills, spider nests, and long forgotten ruins of tiny human activities.

2. Creatures
Grounded will pitch you against many different type of creature, each with their own character, style, and attack preferences. Fight your way through hordes of ants and termites to plunder their food stores, sneak past the spiders and try to avoid getting yourself trapped in their confounded webbing, or test your mettle against the mighty black ox beetles that roam the jungles of the Upper Yard. But don't think the bugs aren't taking notice of your actions. If you bother them too much, you might find they pay you a visit when you return home...

3. Character Progression
As well as having survival and combat elements, Grounded also gives your character many ways to progress in the game, from crafting better tools and weapons from the remains of slain foes, to infusing your character with the power of Yoked Girth Milk Molars. You will uncover character perks as your explore, known as Mutations, which you can activate or deactivate at any time to give yourself advantages in many different situations. Weapons and armor can also be upgraded and imbued with special properties, take advantage of creature weaknesses with elemental weapon upgrades, or give your armor hidden properties with sleek upgrades.

4. Story
Grounded has a fully playable story that will have you exploring the backyard in its entirety. It all starts when trying to reactivate the Mysterious Machine to grow back to your normal size - which unfortunately for you, ends in cataclysmic failure, causing explosive damage to a nearby oak tree and its unassuming robotic resident, BURG.L - Acting Science Manager for Dr Wendell Tully. But it will soon be revealed that the explosion corrupted BURG.Ls memory banks, and he can't remember how to fix the Mysterious Machine. But he does know he has backup files on Super Chips scattered throughout the backyard. It is your mission, brave adventurer, to retrieve them, return them to BURG.L, and try to piece together how you got so small, where Wendell has gone, and most importantly, how to get you home.

5. Exploration
As well as exploring the backyard to help BURG.L recover his memories, there are tons of optional areas to explore as well, all having their own secrets and rewards. Discover the story of past long lost adventurers from Ominent, brought here and tasked with the documentation and classification of Wendell's research and his whereabouts, or discover what happens when you activate all of the MIX.Rs located throughout the backyard. Or follow the stories of the four BIG BUG BOSSES and make it your quest to rid the backyard of these tyrannical creatures... After finding just the right thing to lure them out of hiding. What in the world could enjoy the taste of a Mouldy Haogie!?

6. Base Building
The base building in Grounded is extensive and comprises of several tiers of building structures, starting at grass plank and weed stem buildings, all the way through to mushroom brick and cement structures as the game progresses. As well as having many building options, you can decorate your base with all manner of furniture, crafting stations, lighting and trophies of all the creatures you've killed on your adventures. You can build in most parts of the backyard, and even connect bases with ziplines for fast travel across the backyard.  You will also have access to traps and turrets to defend your base when the bugs come knocking, because believe me, they will, and you'll need to be prepared for the onslaught!

As of the 1.2 Super Duper update, building bases now becomes even more important. As you get a better base, you get higher levels of Coziness, and that gives you new buffs whilst you're in your base, even unlocking more build pieces for you to use. Some of these build pieces also have extra uses when interacted with, like bug wall trophies giving you attack buffs against that particular type of creature, the stuffed bug statues giving you extra chances for rare loot, and the new Petal Bed giving the Comfy Stamina and Comfy Defense buffs to anyone who sleeps in it for the entire next day.

7. Bosses
Grounded has a mixture of required and optional bosses to complete the story. Without giving too much away, there are 2 main story bosses and 5 extra, completely optional bosses that you can fight. All story and optional bosses give you a special mutation upon their defeat, so even if the other five are not required to complete the story, the experience is worth it and the things you can craft from their parts are definitely worth it.

8. Playgrounds
Do you want to make your own maps and challenges in the world of Grounded? With the 1.3 update, you can now create your very own Playgrounds and custom interactions between objects! Place most terrain pieces and points of interest, down to each individual blade of grass, spawn bugs anywhere including bosses, make parkour maps and arenas, the only limit is your creativity!

Now we have some other things to talk about that will make themselves more apparent after a playthrough or two.

1. No Modding Support
Mods for Grounded are extremely limited currently as Obsidian have not enabled mod support for their game at the moment, and have stated that this is not planned. A small group of modders have currently been working on a project to inject mod pak files, but this is not fully finished as of yet. Since the game is built on Unreal Engine we also don't have luxuries like Harmony or BepInEx, making mod creation a little tougher as well.

2. Late Game Creatures
A good majority of the creatures in the late game are essentially reskins of the early game creatures you find in the grasslands. Most of these have some alternate attacks compared to their original counterparts and hit harder, but you may find variety a little lacking. Example: Ladybird being a reskin of a Ladybug. Whilst this is not a dealbreaker or anything, it would be nice eventually to see more variety of creatures in the end game, and as of the 1.2 Super Duper update, the devs have introduced 4 more creatures, 2 of them being bosses. The other noticeable part is that some biomes, such as the Sandbox, only have one type of creature that predominantly resides there, and you won't see much variety in the entire biome. It would be great in future updates if these were fleshed out some more.

Overall, I can highly recommend Grounded. Even after the 1.0 launch the Obsidian team are working hard on more updates, more base pieces, more bosses, and more content for us. Things did feel a little sketchy when 1.0 came out due to much content getting scrapped last minute, but rest assured the 1.2.2 update has convinced me that this game is FAR from done.",1680962849,1699272225,True,273,5,0.931768894195556641,6,True,False,False

Art style, very pleasant for the eye
Building and crafting, the uniqueness of each weapon and armor.
Lots of things to collect, like the creature cards, molars and items. I like games where you have to collect things
The achievements to unlock, all are fun to unlock and not very hard
The story-line, is very interesting and with many lighthearted moments
The custom game mode, after I finished the game on regular mode I played for many hours on custom and built everything that was hard resource-wise on regular

What I wish was in the game:
The story line to be longer, I feel the early game quests are easy and you progress rather quick. That might be my personal experience since I had played the game since early access and had a stronger start when the game launched. But, even after a second playthrough the story felt short.
I wish they fixed the pet bugs AI. when I travel on ziplines they bump onto you so often its infuriating, kicking you off the zipline and having to walk to the destination, which for a long zipline is often times from one corner of the map to the other.
I would love if they didn't cut off content like the inside of the shed, which from the leaks seemed to be almost finished. Or maybe some DLC going to the veranda or even the house. This is no major issue, but could help the developers add a few twists to the story and make it longer.
What I really love on the game are the MIX.R, super MIX.R and JavaMatic missions. they don't guide you at all on how to defend them, and that's what makes them good. you have to build defenses using the building mechanic, resources and your imagination. also there are a few SCA.B schemes that you need to build to get to, those are good moments as well, because the game doesn't tell you how to get them. what I wish was on the game essentially is having more of these moments where you use whatever there's in the game to get something. that's why I like the building mechanic and ziplines especially. you can build as many ziplines you like, anywhere you like, basically ""breaking"" the game's difficulty if you're creative and hard working enough.

Overall the game's one of the best I have played and would recommend to anyone who likes survival games.

currently i cannot say yes to this game in its current state, there is more tech needed in this game like fast travel between camps or some mechanic of some sort 

and alottttt more story explanation, plot developement and dialog in the game other than just documents maybe some cutscenes would be good or ingame sequences, but there is a lacking feeling in this game as such

and a much more advance lobby system to play with other people than just friends to actually make friends

however the premise is quite good, and some things in the game are quiet well done landmarks are interesting enough and enemies or good however they get stale fast after 20 hours of the game

so there is more needed like earwigs, more beetles, moths, butterflys, dragonflys, newts, more underground locations, maybe even going into another garden

The game has gone from a clear 49% for me, to 51%. ;) From ""Too annoying to play"" to ""Still anoying to play, but the fun part slightly outweighs the annoyance. Even if the difficulty spikes are beyond crazy.""

The game has improved since its premature release. Some of the not-so-nice things were patched. What is still most annoying to me is that when you pick up stuff and switch equipment, your backpack's content is automatically re-arranged in what seems to be a random logic. If you can stand this, can stand accidentally tearing down your whole castle because you pulled the wrong brick out of one of its walls, and you do not mind (real-life) days of gathering resources, even for bare-minumum bases, I whole-heartedly recommend playing this game.

Warning to everyone who expects a game with a balanced difficulty, though: This is not it. The game can go from ""relaxing"" to ""WTF - I am dead?"" within seconds. Even on Easy setting.

- - -

Update 1 from August 2022: The devs announced today that the game will leave Early Access in late September 2022. So, it is likely that the basic problems that are here today will be the problems in the ""finished"" game.

So, here is my take on Grounded as of late July 2022 - it could be an almost brilliant game. Note the ""could"".

- - -

My pre-announcement review - I do not expect any of this to change until release:

The game is a mess. It would be fine for $15 and three years more of development, but not priced as a AA game, closing development in two months, with extensive announced additions. Which - as it looks like - will be tested by the gamers in the FINAL version and never fixed, as they pull out the development staff.

If they actually finished and polished the game, it would be a gem among immersive survival games, surpassing Subnautica. Fat chance that they can do this in the remaining two months, when most of the staff will be moved to other Obsidian projects.

For the moment, a clear thumbs down for me, unfortunately. I like what the game had the potential to be, but it is a mile away from that point. The few steps they can take in the remaining two months will make a potentially brilliant game to just be almost good.

Why?

- Too many unfixed bugs and janky features that have been known for years. Every few minutes I stare open-mouthed at the screen and think ""How is this not fixed? It happens so often and is annoying as stepping into a turd in real life."" Just a few examples: Everytime you interact with the inventory, it gets resorted, and not in a consistent way; good luck finding something you just added to the inventory five seconds ago. You can set one (ONE!) marker on the map which disappears from view when the game feels like it. Your character can get into a state where it is impossible to  do certain things, e.g. climb a ladder. The list goes on and on. The building system is janky, as well. Imagine a castle crashing down because you remove one stone.

- Vastly missing quality of life UI features, UI bugs aside. Plus, those UI features that exist are a drag to use with mouse & keyboard: ""Let me quickly eat this mushroom I stored for situations like this."" Four keystrokes later ... ""Oh, wait, I have to find it in the inventory first."" They could learn much from the Subnautica UI. Even from 7 Days to Die. Preventing a deadly opponent spawning begind you in your castle? Long solved  by 7D2D, an unsurmountable probnlem for Grounded. You  just die.

- I see where they were going with the sound stage. They are not there, yet, unfortunately. A dog barking in the distance should not play a sample of ""Dog, barking"". They got it almost right for the backyard crow, looking as big as a skyscraper. When the crow lands on a perch, that sounds like a rockslide. Being the size I am, I would not hear a barking dog. I would either be shaken by a subsonic wave, or notice nothing at all. If they got these super- and sub-perception sounds right, it could be awesome. Not enough time, though.

Currently, it looks like the game will forever be a case of ""almost good"". Let us hope that they do not introduce so many bugs in the final version that it become ""almost unplayable"" instead. Remember, we are talking about a major game studio that has earned almost $100 million already from selling the beta version, not a team of starving, inexperienced newcomers.

What does work already, and actually impresses me:

- The immersion into the environment. The backyard does feel like a jungle / desert / swamp. Visuals, sound, and small details feel great.

- The animals and plants. When blades of grass sway in the distance, you know that a potential enemy beyond a certain weight goes there. Or a harmless ladybug.

The game is fun when it works, but most of the time it does not.

Should you buy Grounded while it still is in Early Access?

If you loved Subnautica, my advicve is to wait until it is out of Early Access. Only those players who played Subnautica for the challenge of killing each Reaper several times over will be guaranteed satisfaction for buying Grounded now. For those who liked to participate in the Subnautica Beta, I would also advise a buy.

If you like what you see in the videos praising the game and have not yet played Subnautice or Subnautica Below Zero, play those first. Remember: Youtubers who seem to be out of themselves for excitement when they present a game video - they make money with the video. The more excitement they show, the more views they generate, which translates into ad income.

The two Subnautica games evoke the feeling which Grounded tries to achieve. (Below Zero for a more guided experience, Subnautica if you like to explore a lot on your own, and do not mind getting frustrated now and then.)

Why do I constantly compare Grounded to Subnautica?

The closest how I could describe Grounded to someone is ""Subnautica, but the Leviathan killer monsters are out to get you right from the start."" You will get the same picture when reading some other reviews. Imagine getting killed by a Leviathan on day 2 repeatedly, while you do not have any idea yet how to build a base. That is the initial Grounded experience.

Manageable, after you understand how the game works. Likely demotivating before that point.

After this, be prepared to grind, and also grind, and grind some more.  For resources.

Otherwise your castle, your bulwark against attacks from hostile animal armies - it will be not the size of a castle, it will be a bathroom with barely the space for sink and toilet. On each attack, you risk losing all the different workbenches you had to build outside, as you did not have the room in your monk's cell. This is why it is easier to play the game with your friends or family. Provided you find someone among them who can stand, as one of the other reviewers put it, ""to grind for seven hours, to achieve one hour of game progress"".",1658747333,1698656953,True,0,0,0.475925803184509277,0,True,False,True

Combat, is pretty solid, the choice of mutations, armor, weapons and learning when to block, the patterns of attack of the various bugs, their weaknesses... that's not quiet ""souls like"" but there's a lot more depth than just wacking away till dead.

Graphically it's good, but I would probably prefer having more option to tweak than the presets provided by the menu - it may look a bit blurry at times.

Sounds, they're ok... nothing amazing, and the music while decent is easily forgettable.  The character dialogues though really add to the feel of the game.

Anyway, I started on medium difficulty and boy oh boy, what a steep learning curve it was. The first 10 days in the game was utter horror with me just sprinting and running from everything like a headless chicken. I almost quit, before I slowly started getting the hang of the game mechanics and then pretty soon I was totally addicted. What a stunning game this is! Absolutely fabulous. 

And today, after 203 days of shrinkage, I am whole again having completed the entire game. I was so into the game that I've spent the last 30 minutes contemplating what to do next.

From the first teaser, this game reminded me of one of my favourite childhood movies ""Honey i shrunk the kids"", and depicted the world almost exactly as I imagined it 33 years ago.

The game has beautiful graphics, fantastic story and sound, but most importantly co-op play. I enjoyed every bit of it playing with my friends. 

Flora and fauna of the backyard where game takes place are masterfully crafted. Base building is spot on, just as weapons and armours are. Difference between night and day, one chill other scary is key part of gameplay. Roaming through tall grass during night time is one hell of a adrenalin rush, while roaming during the day is really relaxing, unless you meet some nasty bug. 

Anyway, fantastic game from a fantastic studio. I enjoyed it from start to finish. Every fan of survival genre should play it.

Solid 8 out of 10 for a survival game. Easy one of the best survival game that have been released in recent years.

The good:
- Very well written story with interesting development. Little notes / memos you find on the way feels like a great enrichment to the story.
- The world / yard design is absolutely amazing. Amount of effort for little details / planning is really showing off. You can tell that people that was in charge of that part of the game did it with huge passion. 
- Pleasant crafting system with a bunch of Quality of Life improvements since original game version release
- Huge diversity in weapons / armors to craft / pick from
- Exploration is rewarding. Your accidental slip off the branch and falling down while yelling out of frustration is quickly to be replaced with ""Oh! It's a shiney down there! Woohoo!"" moment.

The bad:
- Monsters (even a year after game release) still getting stuck in textures. You have monsters spawning in wooden fences / giant rocks / trees.
- Missing tooltips from Weapons / Armor explaining what certain set bonus / ability actually doing before crafting item and equipping it. Yes you read ""Bleed"" or ""Corrosion"" on item.. and..? How much damage it actually do? Is it 1? Is it 1 million? Does it stack? Does it refresh? Is there diminishing return? Is it worth to craft it? No? Do i really need to google this kind of stuff again? *frustration levels rising up*
- Game forces you to google up 3rd party websites in order to find missing Molers / CBA's if you are into full game completion. I think it's a massive flaw of the game that ruins end game / finale enjoyment. While i understand that exploration and fact of mystery is a big part of the game, but if a person beaten game / killed all bosses etc (or point of no return when you are about to grow big again?). Why not let player use Field Stations to scan for missing item like a Moler or CBA's? Even if its not pin-pointing exact location where item is located, at least point an area where to look at (a LAB or area name). That way player still have a last bit of journey / mystery to solve while looking for it. If game design leaves no other option than opening up Youtube guide and following it blindly with 0 excitement / discovery - game dropped the ball, immersion is ruined.
- People going for 100% completion and not understanding why they are stuck at 99% game completion. In-game data collection list shows that everything is found / collected / visited. Well, apparently there are 2 extra Molers (even if you upgraded every possible skill that there is) you still need to find 2 extra ones. Game doesn't tell you that / there is no indicator how many Molers you have already collected and how many you still need to look for.
- Emotes for Raw Science (that is required to buy if you are going for achievements) with current price tag that is now is a bad game design. I'm solo player, I havent used a single character emote in entire playthrough of 100 hours and yet, game is forcing me to spend 30k+ of Raw Science on researching stuff that is literally focused only on certain group of people that play together. This is opposite of fun to grind for something that you know that is useless. If your goal as game designer is to force player to spend X amount of in game currency (Raw Science in our case) then main focus should be allowing to buy people stuff that is usable by everyone and make stuff like Cosmetics / Emote optional for Symbolic price (100-500). While covering price difference of Raw Science by adding other stuff to the shop that is actually FUN:
Faster Zip-Line technology (10-20%) - 10k Raw Science
Additional Trinket Slot - 10k Raw Science
Equip your Aphid pet with Flaming Koltana and witness the making of new John Wick 5 - 30k Raw Science
There are tons and tons of things that player would be excited to grind for without feeling like its a soul breaking torture, because there is some kind of usable reward / advantage in any form at the end. At this point (with current Raw Science prices for Emotes) you can just add a 30k worth piece of paper with a message - ""We really had no idea how to fuck people over to force them play game for a few days more, so here, have this useless piece of paper instead because it has same effect for you as emotes, you wont ever use ANY of those ROFLKEKLOLGAMEDESIGN"".

Is this game worth the money? - ABSOLUTELY!

Shaking dew drops from blades of grass, sneaking into anthills to make bombs, fighting for your life against spiders the size of elephants, this game is packed to bursting with charm and character that just draws you in and grabs ahold of you. If I had to pick one single game to play for the rest of my life this would be the top candidate, because even on a single playthrough there is just so much to do and so many places to explore that by the time you're finished you've essentially forgotten what it was like starting out, and you can just hop right into it again.

Old Review
I tried this game a week before the release. I found it lacking in instruction and direction. Which resulted in a ton of player frustration. It is also disappointing that you cannot create your own character. You're forced into one of the 4 provided characters. Which seems terribly disappointing for a multiplayer game at this day and time.

Over the concept looks promising and the graphics looked ""cute"". The frustration of inadequate instruction just proved to much. Maybe as it releases and more people have input this will correct itself. As of now I can't recommend the game.",1665186112,1696631124,True,0,0,0.34560278058052063,0,True,False,False

- Very Immersive - can really get into the game through the eyes of a shrunken player questing to answer the questions of how they got there.   There are four preset teens to play and they can be swapped as you progress through the game which adds to the variety.
-  The building options are very good including setting up a zip-line network as you progress through the game. 
- Very good storyline to follow however you can deviate from it at any time and play as you like.   Story adds to experience and some of it is needed to continue crafting better gear, weapons and character enhancements. 
- Community if very active with plenty of guides & videos available. 
- No bugs encountered yet, It is fun to be able to play through with 0 glitches so far. 
- Spiders!  The bugs in this game are so realistic including awesome graphics.  

I will continue to update as I play through, taking time to enjoy the game, time flies when having fun!

Now I've played 320 hours and gotten every achievement and my god has it been the best 320 hours spent in a game period.

+ Some of the best progression I've seen in a Survival game

+ Has a story with a beginning and an end, so you have something to aim towards constantly.

+ Has one of the best building systems and a fun hauling system in place, so this also makes for something to aim towards.

+ Has RPG elements, and plenty of them as expected from an Obsidian title. Stats that can be acquired through [spoiler]Milk Molar candies[/spoiler] and items to get through the progression

+ A rather large open world/garden to roam in. All areas are open from the beginning pretty much, but requires better gear, otherwise yo screwed, but you can go there! (Goes back to Fallout pretty much)

+ A full underwater system and places to go there too, though short lived, it's still fun during that time.

+ Best inventory/chest management I've seen.. All Survival games I will compare to this moving forward and I HAVE. (Press N to deposit all current items to a chest that has that exact item already in it) Build structures and items from Chests within distance. (Goes for Pallets too, this is where you store hauled grass planks and weed stems)

+ 1.2 added so much great stuff from Boss improvements and new enemies like the [spoiler]Wasps and Wasp Queen[/spoiler]

+ Fantastic combat system that is easy to learn and once you learn enemy attack patterns they become much easier to deal with, so it's not unfair, it's all about how YOU learn about them. (You can cheese them too, if that's your thing)

+ Potions and Cooking. Potions are simple to make, uses a base ingredient which is required and 3 ingredients that you can freely choose what to be. Be it grass fiber or pebbles.. Just as long as 3 items are used. Food is made using a variety of jerkies and other meats, but they provide long lasting boosts, which is stacked with potion effects.

+ Base defense (Once you've pissed off some bugs long enough)

+ Base defense II, these are spoilers, so I won't mention the name. But you gotta defend these points using anything at your disposal. Build defenses, walls and other things and stock up. (This provides an achievement when all are defended and some small items to aid your journey temporarily)

+ Weapon and Armor upgrading, these materials are found throughout the areas you visit, so look carefully. [spoiler]They are finite during the first half of the game.[/spoiler]

+ Mutations (This is basically leveling in the game besides stat boosts through the other mentioned means) These are earned doing their respective things, such as attacking enemies with the specific weapon that the mutation improves. Or simply running out of breath over and over again etc. (Like Fallout/Oblivion skills) Initially 2 can be activated at a time, this can further be increased with the other mentioned stat boost system.

+ Dude it's just great... Buy it if you like RPG's and Survival Games.


- Farming is extremely disappointing. Even with the latest update it's slow and very expensive compared to the alt methods of acquiring those items.

- Medium is a tad too easy in my opinion.. The reason why I don't play Whoa! (Hard) is because it makes your item durability drain SO FAST! And that grind becomes tedious fast.. But that's just me. In order to avoid that, you'd have to fully upgrade your stuff, which is not possible until late game.

- Pets are awful.. Don't bother unless you play Custom Game.

- Some minor frame rate issues with a lot of light objects like torches and so on.

If you're looking for fun combat look else where, 2 buttons, easy learnable parries and basically 3 bug types except there is just a bunch of reskins.
Looking for a different experience that you can have very good fun with friends. Get this game.
If you're looking for fun combat just play dark souls and once you are tired of that build a house in mc and rinse and repeat, I love the game but in some ways it is very lazily done.
Maybe with a larger budget and a larger media coverage, this could of been one of the greatest in most eyes expect from a few like mine.

The game’s logical gameplay conveniences, appealing identity, phenomenal graphical composition/lighting, and abundant environmental details always made scheduled weekly sessions with friends something to look forward to.

Exploring Grounded's handcrafted landscape is a thoroughly engaging task as the world contains a dense variety of unique features, helpful secrets, and new resources. The backyard feels big enough to always have somewhere new to discover yet small enough to traverse in reasonable amounts of time (especially with the help of a system of zip lines). It’s also memorable enough that Grounded forgoes the use of a minimap and is able to limit its main map to be primarily informational. Even though you can get literally lost in the weeds when in unfamiliar territory, it’s easy to get your bearings thanks to all the giant surrounding landmarks. However, I did still find myself wishing for an on-screen compass every now and then, if only to have quick knowledge of my relative direction during travel.

I enjoyed how there's a touch of story to contextualize your movement up the food chain as well as to motivate through exploration of this detailed world. So many other survival crafting games lack this kind of connective flavor. It by no means leads the experience, but it does feel great to be curious about what narrative clues unsurveyed locations may contain and excited whenever you know an answer lies around the corner.

Towards the very end, once you've essentially seen the whole yard, the grind for materials picks up a decent bit. Useful materials exist in less abundance but equipment gets used up or requires repair at the usual rate. A repetitive process of maintaining your supply of the upper tiers of resources takes the stage and the meaningful exploration that's essentially been used up at that point can no longer distract you from your material needs. But that happened like 35+ hours in for us, and it was more of a sign that we had basically done everything we wanted to.

Solo play is serviceable, although it won’t be the most expedient way to play. I reckon it’d be much more difficult in comparison as well. Grounded is clearly built around having a squad for delegating survival tasks and additional agro/damage for tough enemies. The four-player aspect is even baked right into the four-playable characters. So, if you’ve got two or preferably three friends who are interested in a collaborative game and coordinated enough to see the adventure through, Grounded should be an easy pick for you.

(Also, thank you for the 'spider slider' option. It made them merely terrifying in gameplay and not visually terrifying too.)",1695779173,1695779173,True,3,0,0.549614608287811279,0,True,False,False

Rather than a punishing grind requirement or ridiculous carry restrictions as a mechanism to (antagonistically) extend the playability time or cripple progression in a game that inherently lacks content; these devs have stepped up and created a world environment that is challenging - along with the gathering and progression feeling more natural and organic (cough), rather than punitive or ridiculously crippled to make up for a world design itself lacking in challenge as so many other games must resort to. 
Maybe it wasn't so - from the beginning of the game's life cycle.  At this point though I give a solid two thumbs up to these guys after playing for a good 3-4 days or so.  I've heard that the mid to late game progression feels like it stalls a bit, or ramps up too high too fast for gaining tiers and access to improved items.

It's a great premise (albeit nabbed from an 80s flick), has a high level of polish, and is pretty large and deep. It does a really excellent job of quality-of-life gameplay ideas. For example, as you level up you can carry more planks. Can't do that in Raft. Can't do that in Green Hell.  Automatically pulling resources from nearby storage when crafting/building is a huge plus.  Whoever designed some of these mechanics are really good at their job.  The bugs and combat and such are also very very good. Having your torch go out in the middle of the night with a spider in the area instantly becomes a horror game. I had a larva attacking me so I jumped on a nearby clover. The larva began cutting down the clover, so I jumped to the next, so he cut started cutting down that one. That's amazing. It's got a lot of RPG elements for a survival game. The map is huge, varied, and interesting. Probably the best feature is the way it handles multiplayer hosting. The saved file is stored in the xbox cloud, then the first of your white-listed group who tries to play at any given time, they become the host. So me and my friends can all play whenever we want without one person running a server or leaving their game running or any of that nonsense. All multiplayer survival games should do it this way. I waited years to buy it because it never seemed to go on sale when I was ready to get into a new game.

Starting the game, we got rekt by almost every evil creature. Without knowing attack patterns in the first hours, it was a complete desaster and ended up being very hard to be confident in the fighting system. After finally getting to know the game, starting to actually play the story and do the labs and stuff, it was hard because even though the blocking etc helped, enemy masses just were crazy.  Later, with proper equipment ofc, we ended up being slightly overpowered? Like wolfspiders, infected ones and all the bosses were peanuts, regardless of the difficulty (medium). It started very hard, but ended up being no challenge. The only challenge we had was simply not killing each other while fighting. 
The story was interesting and ended up like expected. But the grind for the achievement of the 100% report card was literally pain. Going through everything, we ended up playing 25h or so just to get to the 100% (which we would never have reached if we didn't look up what was missing). I gladly deinstalled the game directly after getting the final achievement lol.

The glitches whatsoever became apparent in the building system. I loved the way of placing the blueprint before actually building something, so you could proper do the planning, but when you put in the materials, the object itself moved from the blueprint spot to another one, which could be solved by just placing other walls/objects first, but it was still really annoying.
When something was destroyed or loot was dropped, sometimes it's very hard to pick it up, because it is bugged either inside the ground or just being at a different position. 

Anyways, Grounded is a wonderful survival game to play with friends, and I highly recomment to give it a chance!

Jeez, what an honest review xD

EDIT:

The new update with the new bosses was fun to play, but also a hard challenge. The Wasp Queen was way easier to beat than the infected Broodmother, however not easy after all. The broodmother was absolutely hard to kill, we looked up strats and had much heal and buffs but we managed to kill her after roughly 15 attempts.

Have had ants clip through walls and wolf spiders spawn inside the house, most enemies will at points randomly decide to stop being intelligent and just let you kill them or cheese them. There is a mechanic where some enemies, such as the mosquito will fly away when weak but becomes totally invulnerable to attacks, I fail to understand why this would ever be a good feature so I'm going to call that a bug. The depth of field is broken, things in the background can never be totally focused on so it just makes your character feel like they just have terrible vision. The inventory and hotbar mechanic is unnecessarily unique, perhaps I just don't see whatever benefit it has over something like Terraria. Why not just have the top row of items in the inventory serve as the hotbar? And for controller players to just have a few buttons mapped to particular slots? 

Already reviews covering the building I'm sure so I wont comment on that. Final note: Just hold out for maybe another year or two for a sale and more content because as it stands this doesn't have the quality to recommend for $30.

--------September 2023 Update-----------------
Game is in a much better state, not perfect but way less bug/cheese prone as it was 2 years ago. If this game seems interesting to you definitely give it a shot, I'm enjoying it a lot right now.

This pint-sized adventure offered a host of impressive features that left us buzzing with excitement. Here's a closer look at what makes Grounded such a standout experience:

1. Ingenious Building System: Grounded's building mechanics are a true highlight. Crafting intricate bases and structures is a breeze, and the attention to detail is nothing short of astonishing. It truly feels like you've been shrunken down and are constructing epic fortresses in your own backyard.

2. Streamlined User Interface: The game's interface and quality of life features are a breath of fresh air. Accessing resources from nearby chests and quickly storing items became second nature, streamlining the gameplay experience and eliminating needless tedium.

3. Diverse Adversaries: Grounded excels in creature diversity. The array of enemies and formidable bosses each bring unique strengths and weaknesses to the table, ensuring that combat remains engaging and unpredictable throughout the game.

4. Adaptability Through Mutations, Weapons, and Armor: The ability to customize your character's abilities through mutations adds a layer of strategy to combat. Combined with an arsenal of weapons and armor, Grounded offers a rich variety of options to tackle its challenges, allowing players to experiment and find their preferred playstyle.

5. Thrilling Defense Events: Few things are as exhilarating as defending your base against a horde of relentless foes. Grounded delivers on this front with exciting defense events that demand quick thinking, teamwork, and effective utilization of your resources.

6. Achievements with Attainable Goals: One of Grounded's standout features is its achievable achievements within a single playthrough. This design choice provides a sense of accomplishment as you progress through the game, making each milestone a satisfying conquest.

7. Engaging Story and Quests: Grounded isn't just about surviving in a backyard; it weaves an engaging narrative with intriguing quests. This element adds a sense of purpose to your adventures, making the game feel more like an epic quest than a mere survival sandbox.

8. Abundant Resource Variety: Grounded offers a plethora of resources scattered throughout its diverse locations. This feature ensures that the farming aspect of the game never grows monotonous. Whether you're scouring the grasslands, exploring the depths of a murky pond, or venturing into the dense foliage of the backyard, the game consistently rewards exploration with an array of valuable materials. This abundance keeps the farming part of the game engaging and ensures that you and your friends always have new objectives to pursue, enhancing the overall depth of the experience.

While Grounded offers an abundance of thrilling features, it does have one notable drawback: the four-player limit. For those with larger friend groups, like our party of six, this limitation can be a bit disappointing. However, it's a minor blemish on an otherwise stellar gaming experience.

In conclusion, Grounded is an exceptional co-op survival game that immerses you in a world where the ordinary becomes extraordinary. From its ingenious building system to its diverse enemies and engaging narrative, it captivates players in a microcosmic adventure like no other. While it may not accommodate larger groups, it more than makes up for it with its wealth of features and satisfying gameplay. Grounded has certainly earned its place among the best in the genre, and I eagerly anticipate the adventures that await as the game continues to evolve and expand.",1695589011,1695590320,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

While it's undeniably entertaining with a group of four, the prospect of accommodating larger parties, perhaps 6 to 10 players, would undoubtedly take the cooperative chaos to new heights.

The game's building mechanics are a standout feature, offering an intuitive and deeply satisfying crafting and construction system. This allows players to unleash their creativity as they erect fortifications to fend off the looming threats in their tiny world.

A small but wonderful detail that greatly enhances the gameplay experience is the automatic storage solution for chests. It simplifies inventory management and showcases the developers' commitment to player convenience, earning a special place in players' hearts.

Grounded also distinguishes itself with a compelling storyline and engaging quests, providing players with purpose and motivation as they delve into the secrets hidden within the backyard.

Boss battles and defense events in the game are nothing short of exhilarating. They present formidable challenges and a genuine sense of accomplishment when conquered, elevating the cooperative gaming experience to new heights.

Achievements in Grounded are genuinely attainable, serving as satisfying milestones to pursue and enhancing the game's replayability factor.

One unique and noteworthy feature is the mutations system, which bestows buffs upon all players and can be easily unlocked. This introduces an exciting layer of strategy into the gameplay, encouraging diverse and inventive approaches to survival.

Lastly, there's an oddly therapeutic quality to resource farming in Grounded. It's a captivating and immersive aspect of the game that keeps players immersed in the miniature world they're exploring.

In summary, Grounded is a must-play for survival game enthusiasts, particularly those who have found enjoyment in titles like Ark and Valheim. With its emphasis on cooperative play, outstanding building mechanics, immersive storyline, thrilling boss encounters, and player-friendly features like automatic storage, Grounded stands out as a top-tier entry in the genre.

base building is streamlined and well thought out, easy to build and allows easy relocation of assets no problem. All resources are fully refunded when recycled, so it doesn't punish you and allows you to experiment to your hearts desire.

Me and a few friends could play this before full release and experience no disconnects. Now it seems since 1.0 it's absolute garbage. One of my friends died in Haze Lab boss fight and didn't spawn with any equipment. Nor was it in his death bag.

The world and even the scenario are familiar—you are tiny, ant-sized, trying to survive a hostile backyard environment as in the movie ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids."" But rich, realistic visuals, creative and thoughtful open-world design, and the bright, eclectic sounds of a tiny living jungle make the world compelling and immersive, leading to adventures much greater than you might imagine finding in a common suburban backyard. 

Go murky cavern-diving in the koi pond, dash for shade in the sizzling desert of the sandbox, climb the maze of webbed branches in the hedge, crawl through ant-crowded tunnels. The world of Grounded and its experiences are surprisingly varied. One moment you'll be searching for moonlit dewdrops in the tips of grass above you, the next you'll be running, not daring to look back, as a massive spider chases you through terrifying darkness, crashing through the cracking grass stalks, intense music drumming up heart-pounding fear. 

Build a tiny sanctuary out of grass blades and stems, research better equipment and explore deeper into the yard, struggle to survive at the wrong end of a long food chain. Uncover secrets and discover sights in a world where a piece of trash or a discarded toy are imposing and strange as alien monoliths. At the time of this review, there is a story, but don't expect it to ever be as compelling as the need to scout, build, and thrive. Grounded gives players a well-crafted and rewarding virtual world in which to do that.

One caveat: Grounded has the most spidery spiders that ever spided. Seriously, this warrants caution.",1652601272,1695169152,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,True

I thought the trailer was cool, Obsidian Entertainment had made my favorite fallout game, and it was on sale. 74 hours later I finally finished the campaign and man, what a journey. This game is one of the most competent and well put together survival games that on the market right now. I spent hours building and customizing my base, going from a scared teenager being hunted by spiders to becoming a one girl army slaughter hordes of spiders and other little beasts. Other than a couple bugs phasing through the ground and a few moments where the game slowed to a crawl, I am happy to saw I never encountered and glitches that harmed my experience with Grounded. I full-heartedly recommend Grounded for anyone with a passing interest in the survival genre and experience the wonderful world that Obsidian has crafted in Grounded. 

TL;DR: Grounded is a massively better survival game than The Forest and Rust by a mile and I will fight anyone who disagrees.

There's endless goals to finish even after the end game (collecting all the bug cards, finding all the items/collectibles, expanding your bases etc.). Though I will say, multiplayer can be buggy. I disconnected multiple times but it didn't deteriorate my experience of the game. The bugs that happened for me included:

-dew drops not spawning correctly
-materials not being able to be picked up
-blueprints appearing even though structures were built 

The Host never got most of these bugs but I didn't mind at all. You can also play the game with 2 other friends who own the game! Even though my boyfriend is the real gamer between us, it's a game that you can develop other gaming skills as you play more (I suck at parrying and fighting lol) I had fun collecting materials for our base and fighting alongside him.

It's like ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"" got a video game adaptation, and the result is a survival game that's as engaging as it is unique. Craft tools, build shelters, and fend off gigantic bugs as you explore a world where everyday objects become towering obstacles and small critters turn into menacing foes.

The graphics are vibrant and bring the miniature world to life in vivid detail. Whether you're spelunking in anthills or creating your own leafy fortress, the game provides a variety of activities that make survival an engaging endeavour. You can go it alone or team up with friends, offering flexibility in how you tackle the challenges ahead.

Having graduated from early access, ""Grounded"" is a polished experience that offers hours of gameplay for both solo players and teams alike. If you're looking for a fresh spin on the survival genre or ever wondered what life looks like from a bug's perspective, this game is a must-play. 🐜🍃

Rating: ★★★★☆ (4/5)

Review:
Grounded takes a giant leap into a tiny world, transforming your everyday backyard into a captivating and visually stunning microcosm. Obsidian Entertainment's foray into survival gaming brings a fresh perspective, melding survival mechanics with the wonder of exploring a world from a minuscule perspective.

The scale shift is truly the star of the show here. From towering blades of grass to insects that become fearsome foes, the attention to detail in creating a believable miniature ecosystem is commendable. The art direction and level design turn your surroundings into a captivating playground of discovery.

The survival mechanics add depth to the experience. Gathering resources, constructing shelters, and crafting tools form the core gameplay loop. The gradual progression system ensures that your character evolves in tandem with your understanding of the environment, keeping the gameplay engaging as you adapt to your new circumstances.

Co-op shines in Grounded. Joining forces with friends to tackle the challenges of the backyard is where the game truly shines. Cooperation is essential for tackling larger threats and building intricate bases. The blend of humor and camaraderie during multiplayer sessions creates memorable moments.

However, as with any early access title, there are areas that could use polish. Some bugs and performance issues can momentarily take you out of the immersion. Additionally, while the current content is enjoyable, the game's overall scope might leave you wanting more variety in creatures, crafting options, and exploration opportunities.

Grounded's potential is evident. The developers have shown a commitment to regular updates and improvements, promising a promising trajectory for the game's future. As the title continues to evolve and expand, it's likely to grow into an even more captivating experience.

In summary, Grounded offers a refreshing take on the survival genre, allowing players to experience the marvels and challenges of a miniature world. The potential for growth combined with the joy of co-op exploration makes this early access title one to watch. Dive into the backyard and get ready to uncover the hidden wonders that await.",1620592469,1693238757,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The exploration is very rewarding - you have a feeling that you can find something interesting in every corner. The combat is challenging, but not overly punishing (we played on Medium). The base building feels really good, it's easy to build the kind of base you set out to. The gear/skill progression feels meaningful - but not to the point that new stuff invalidates all previous gear instantly. Also, it's not overly grindy (except maybe some of the late game weapons/enchantments).

[b] Theme [/b]
They chose a really interesting theme and developed it almost flawlessly. Many times with a cool concepts you end up thinking that there was a lot of wasted potential in the execution, but this is not the case. There were countless instances where I said ""wow, I'd have never though of putting this into the game, this cool!"".
I can't really comment on the story as I skipped most of the exposition since I was playing with a friends, for what I saw it seems at least servisable.

[b] Art/Graphics [/b]
The art style complements the theme and it's gorgeous, but it still runs well on lower end pcs. My laptop only had some problems in some parts of a foggy area, but I still didn't feel the need to lower the settings. I'm still surprised they managed to make the plants translucent without impacting performances.

[b] Gameplay [/b]
The gameplay is a mix of exploration, combat and crafting, all driven by a story/set of quests. All these elements complement and blend with eachother in a really nice way, pushing you to keep exploring to craft new things, discover new creatures and unlock new and interesting parts of the map.

[b] Crafting [/b]
The crafting and base building left me especially pleased, including a bunch o quality of life choices that improve the longevity of the game, like being able to move built items at will, even crates full of items.

[b] Combat [/b]
The actual combat isn't deep but works well, with a mix of ""dodging"", parring and attacking. After playing a while some enemies' fighting patterns can start to become repetitive, but usually at that point you are suoppoped to face new ones so it works. The combat preparation on the other hand can be deeper, as you can choose the type of weapon, the type of armor, which consumables to bring and which mutations (special buff you can swap at will) to use.

[b] Exploration [/b]
This is probably the biggest selling point of the game. Each ""biome"" is nicely flashed out and usually with a nice spin or gimmick. New areas often leave you in awe and with child-like wonder. Reaching a new biome feels like an accomplishment, and while doing that sometimes involve obtaining a new crafter tool/equipment (kind of like a metroidvania) the game never prevents you from doing that in more creative ways.

[b] FINAL CONCLUSIONS [/b]
This is probably the best crafting/survival game out there for my taste and I recommend it.

Pros:
 - almost everything, the game is a seamless blend of art, theme and gameplay element that mix together to deliver an outstanding game

Cons:
 - combat can get repetitive at times if you decide to fight the same enemies over and over
 - the netcode is a bit wonky at times. sometimes the players that are not hosting might not be able to see certain water droplets, or see build items (walls, crates, etc.) still in construction, if they were completed while they were far.

Well . . . that's no longer true. They are huge and they can smash, kick, stab, bite, slash, poison, and straight up destroy you in an instant! 

I love it! Game runs smooth as butter, too. Good job Obsidian. You all nailed it and thought of just about everything a gamer wants in a game like this.

Had already a friend that didn't want to play it anymore because of this.

In singleplayer it doesn't happen except that sometimes there is an empty slot in inventory and also the storage chest and when i try to put something in that slot, OR nothing happens, or the item you try to put in that slot, just vanish... But you will never know what slot it could be so. That is a minor bug but yea..

I just wish that, when someone or a company make a game and wants (or must from another company) co-op/multiplayer for that game (no matter if it's for more money or just for more attention or whatever...), why not make that just working, why do stuff have to dissapear and all that nonsense?
Why IF someone finally play a cute game with someone in co-op, the game does things a player totally turned down by. Okay, as long a guest player stays in the game, there is no problem but.... when the host save the game and both log out, go for diner or somethin' and later they return to play further, all stuff is gone for the guest player. That's not fun, totally stab in the back IF players must wait a month (or even longer as they described on their site)
It says: ""Coming soon (These are approximately a few months off)""
source: https://grounded.obsidian.net/feature-board

And without hotfix in between we are left with (yes again), a game that is broken in co-op.

Seems a good way for companies to make a single player game into a co-op game so they can raise the amount of people to buy it, nothing wrong with that but at least give us a working one.

This became even worse with the last 0.3 patch that came 30-09-2020

Now they give the game a weekend for free to users. Very bad move imo. But whatever,

They do know how to change the game so it's harder for people to survive but what everybody ask to change inventory that everything stay's where you placed it is too hard to do for them.

They truly don't even listen to the community. Like always.


Edit: 28-09-2022
Full game is out now but the inventory is the same shit like always, they didn't change the annoying inventory where you have to look through your stuff repeatetly and sort it every minute. Stuff don't go where they belong, they have a mind of their own.

Sorry Obsidian but this irritates me from day 1 and is asked so many times to change it, you don't even listen to the community.
Also you deleted the old ziplines which i loved. The new zipline is slow and boring.

And if you going deeper into building and whatnot, pieces snap together the totally wrong way and thus you can't build something nice unless you use cheats and such.

Also the sounds stayed muffled when equip other gear and stuff like that.
I got irritated by the most small annoying things they never haad worked on and never tried to finish.
It's alway's the same irritating shit.

And you can find this funny, no worries. You just find it as annoying as most of us do.
And when they broke the game with a patch, we can wait for weeks and weeks for a fix???

You better switch to a beta version again cause this is no way near a REL version.

Since they deleted the bug section that was full of glitches that are in the gamee I post this here for you all to see:

I've been playing since the pond update in early access so I have restarted and play through all the available content multiple times as updates were made. A couple years later here I am playing again going for 100% run. 

There is a lot more whimsy in this survival game than any other I've played. 

The various play modes and options you can customize help most players find a style that is fun for them. You can make it so you can just explore and build as you please while discovering the story or you can make everything a challenge/grind.

Each of the characters you can play as have their own personalities making replaying a bit more fun as you can have different commentary/reactions as you explore. If you play with friends your characters will talk to each other.

In real life I have a bug phobia... still love this game. I'm mentioning that in case you too are thinking of passing on this due to 'bug' issues. 

There is a lot of content in the game. The map feels huge despite being a backyard. There are several distinct biomes. There are multiple dungeons (labs & underground tunnels). The Hedge feels like a forest with the lab areas being set up like tree fort. The Pond is the underwater biome with a lab definitely feeling more like secret agent hideout. The Haze feels like an alien planet that is hazardous to your health. The Sandbox is a desert that can literally cook you. The Grill is like a volcano  that can also cook you.  The Blank Ant Lab feels like a labyrinth. The Termite Mound... well every game has a worst dungeon... it exists. The upper Yard feels like jungle. 

There is fair number of enemies (to be fair several are re-skins) but most types have their own attack patterns, habits, and loot. When you start out, especially on 'Whoa!' mode, most enemies can kill you in 1 to 3 hits. You need to make armor and get skilled at blocking real quick.. or running away. Running away is real good option at the start.

You'll quickly learn new recipes/blueprints and create better weapons/armor/bases.  I've seen a lot of people complain about progressing to tier two weapons/armor... go to the Hedge like the game suggests. Web sacs have more than spiders inside them. You'll be able to get some key resources that way instead of taking on insects you are not ready for. Once you have a tier 2 hammer things really start changing as you can open milk molars which let you upgrade basic stats and storage.

I'm not much of a survival-craft kind of person. I enjoyed minecraft, but once I run out of objectives for survival and start living comfortably, I tend lose interest quickly. This game avoids that entirely. With a fully cohesive story line, constant challenges, and a full and rather sizeable yard to explore, I never ran out of stuff to do all the way through to the end.
Cute but accurate insect depictions made for an interesting and educational experience, while also providing arachnophobia sensitive settings. Combat is simplistic but still satisfying, bosses are challenging but fun. The level up system along with the weapons and armor crafting had me trying all sorts of weapon/armor/damage types.

""Grounded"" is a charming and inventive take on the survival genre that shrinks players down to the size of insects and immerses them in a visually stunning micro-world. Set in a suburban backyard teeming with life, the game offers a unique perspective on survival, exploration, and cooperation.

The visuals in ""Grounded"" are a highlight in themselves. The level of detail put into crafting a realistic environment from a miniature perspective is nothing short of impressive. Blades of grass become towering forests, pebbles transform into imposing boulders, and insects take on new significance as both adversaries and resources. The attention to detail captures the sense of wonder that comes with exploring a familiar world from an entirely different viewpoint.

The survival mechanics in ""Grounded"" are well-executed, requiring players to gather resources, build shelters, and craft tools to thrive in their tiny environment. The game encourages creative problem-solving, whether it's constructing a base out of everyday objects or devising strategies to take on the surprisingly menacing insects that inhabit the yard.

Multiplayer is a strong focus in ""Grounded,"" allowing players to team up with friends to tackle challenges, build bases, and explore together. The cooperative gameplay adds a layer of social interaction that can be highly rewarding, particularly when working together to overcome formidable foes.

However, it's important to note that, as an early access title, ""Grounded"" might have some rough edges. Bugs and performance issues are to be expected, and the content available during early access might be limited compared to the game's full potential. Players looking for a polished and complete experience might want to wait until the game's development progresses further.

In conclusion, ""Grounded"" presents a novel concept that sets it apart from other survival games. Its immersive world and unique mechanics make it a captivating experience, especially for those intrigued by the idea of exploring a world from a miniature perspective. While it might still be a work in progress, the foundation ""Grounded"" has laid out showcases a game with immense potential, and it's worth keeping an eye on as it continues to evolve during its early access phase.",1692734322,1692734322,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The amount of details in this world is amazing. The graphics are stunning and the story is nice. The building aspect is good with a decent amount of materials and items to choose from. The devs created the perfect atmosphere with a world full of areas to explore.
My only complaint is the multiplayer. I played through the whole game, getting 100% achievements with a partner without problems, but we ran into connecting issues after playing for a week or so. It wasn't game-breaking for us, but it was annoying and frustrating. Often the host had no issues, but the second player kept getting kicked off the session. I'm not sure what this was caused by since there were no pattern to it. However, more often than not, we had no problems, but I did read about others who were very effected by this issue.
Multiplayer issues aside, this is one of the most detailed and fun games I've ever played. I've spend hours upon hours, just running around and exploring every little corner and cave of this stunning world.

The game just does not have any sort of balance at all. Even on the ""Mild"" Difficulty the game starts at hard and only gets harder. Insect HP is so high and their movements so erratic it takes over 1 minute to kill a single large insect. Then once its dead it gives 1 material only. So you have to spend 30 minutes hunting just to make a single piece of gear.

Normally as a game progresses enemies get harder but you also get more powerful. Not in this game. Enemies just keep getting tankier and with faster attack combos. Even farming upgrade materials and upgrading our gear did not help.

Honestly just feels like the devs made the game hard to make play time longer. Don't bother with this game. it is not worth the time. After 26 hours and with teir 3 gear my brother and I are abandoning our play through.

Drop rates are too low.
Insect HP is too high.

The positive: I like the enemies, base building and crafting is great, good survival mechanics, , good upgrades, great looking world that is fun to explore

Negative: the game just becomes a slog to play where you have to travel far to get rare resources and along the way you have to fight an annoying number of enemies. I don't mind a challenge, but it just becomes annoying to fight the same spider tens of times, and what makes it worse is that if you kill too many of a type of enemy you have to do annoying home defense event, it would have been better if you killed enough of an enemy they would leave you alone so you could get things done.
Worse is this game ends with a pain in the ass tower defense event and to be better prepared for that you have to do other annoying tower defense events. I played solo, maybe less frustrating with other players

1. has a complex, [i]hand-crafted[/i] map that the game focuses around exploring. this is key; randomly-generated maps just won't do.
2. as you explore, more and more of the map becomes your home, your stomping ground, as you become familiar with it. areas that were once terrifying are now not so bad. but neither do old areas become ""obsolete"" as you ""level out"" of them, either.
3. you slowly get more powerful -- not just through gear upgrades, but also through understanding how to deal with (often very lethal) dangers and threats around you.

I played alone, so I can't speak how Grounded is with friends, but the difficulty was rather high -- but at the same time, that high difficulty rewarded creative gameplay and wise choices, making me feel very clever when I came up with a way to defeat something much stronger than me.

Overall, it's a really unique experience. If you like the idea of exploring a big, layered, and terrifying world filled with things that want to kill you, you'll have a lot of fun with Grounded.",1691652730,1691652730,True,2,0,0.54703831672668457,0,True,False,False

It's key selling point are atmosphere and level design - basically what I bought it for after watching a colleague play it. Ever since ""Honey I shrunk the kids"" I wanted to experience this concept in a game form and that's very much what you get here. It's absolutely great in that respect and unique in the way it represents it.

What I didn't like, though, is (unfortunately) most of the gameplay. There's a whole load of base building, crafting, farming, grinding, being annoyed about overly tanky enemies (especially bosses) and a damage system that has conceptional connections to the bug world you're in but is so abstracted-out that I barely ever bothered using it. A lot of what you can do in the game is locked until you've found certain areas and have beaten certain bosses with areas of interest being simply unmanageable/inaccessible to due to lack of key items and/or resources. This will leave the more exploration minded player frustrated at first and then gradually bored since ""the good stuff"" requires grinding another hour to get key materials, build stuff and wait for crafting stations to have another layers of materials for more crafting. Combine this with an often more functional than exciting combat + item management system and you get a whole load of moments where you simply have to force yourself to continue. It gets better with major advances in your main quest  but I only found every, say, third point of key advancement to be interesting in terms of rewards (exploration, new interactions etc).

Overall, it works quite ok since there are many elements to busy yourself with and certain moments only truly work if you've spend a decent amount of time working towards it. What absolutely didn't work for me under any circumstances were the bosses, consistently respawning enemies, overly long enemy health bars (without ways to shorten battles), lackluster base defense mechanisms (you're often better off just fighting normally) and the amount of grinding to required to advance any of your gear or even base building blocks. Maybe that's because I played solo and prefer exploring, but I can't imagine having fun grinding even more to upgrade four players than just one. Afaik there are game options to simply unlock most advances at game start but that of course kills the fun of progression. A poor but welcomed fix if I ever want to play it it again.

As such, I can recommend it to players who don't mind tackling mandatory grinding with the outlook of experiencing a rather unique feel and level design. Personally I don't think I'll be touching it again for at least a couple years but will be looking forward to playing it again with adjusted settings where I don't need to bothered with its lackluster elements.",1691613864,1691613864,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Exploration is very satisfying, the game looks stunning, the music is absolutely on point (the whole game is worth playing just for that sweet ""Noble Spirit"" to play before growing up) and the atmosphere is chilling!

All in all, it reminds me a lot of Subnautica - not the aesthetic, obviously, but the style of play in terms of surviving, building and exploring. Your bases can genuinely be very satisfying to build - I love my strongholds - and the build-tool is intuitive and simple. Building one grand base is entirely plausible, but you'll probably build a few outposts as well (I'd recommend this in general).

Exploring feels great - but like Subnautica, beware! When you're swimming through the endless ocean, you might just hear a roar off in the distance... You tilt your craft down as you zoom through the ocean, but looking down 100 - 200 m you cannot see nothing in that dark void below you ... when suddenly a leviathon pops out and OH MY GAAWWWD!!!! Well... You'll find yourself hitting similar vibes in this on the occasion. You're walking around, and suddenly you hear some monstrous shriek and then there's 8 legs crawling all over you! Those Wolf Spiders are not to be underestimated, even when you are kitted out with some of the best gear.. I've gotten some of, if not the, best gear in the game, and when I'm running from A to B at max sprint through the blades of grass, I still get those tingles down my spine that at any minute I could just run into something seriously scary! With the way the world works, your vision is actually very limited at times, and it can be unnerving to say the least.

But! This is why the game is so damn good! It starts hard, and though those early areas become relatively easy, you still have to be on edge a little! There may be secrets you missed and there's little challenges knocking around as well, so an ""old"" area isn't ignored once you've gone onto the next (which I like).

And again, visually, it's very charming. The armour and weapons are nicely varied, and some of the higher tiers genuinely look pretty sweet!

All in all, this game is absolutely fantastic and WELL worth the money!! If you're a little hesitant, then shove it on your wishlist and wait for a discount. And do note that you absolutely can play it solo - I've completed the game entirely on my own on medium.

To be honest, it was very challenging to survive on the first day of playing. All of us had no idea what was going on and what we were supposed to do to survive, while meeting mobs every ten steps and getting wrecked left and right. (we played in medium difficulty.) i was pretty frustrated and actually thought about refunding the game. But boy, am I glad that I decided to stick through. As soon as we got the hang of it, it was one of the most engaging multiplayer experience. It took a lot of guides, trials and errors and youtube videos to really understand everything and learn stuff the game would not tell you though. But it is so worth it and I find myself continuing to build and explore everyday even after we finished the story quests. I do have some suggestions: cutscenes for the boss encounters and as a building fanatic, it would be nice to see some more furniture variations like lounge beds, parasols, flower vases to help make the bases even more cozier.

1) A compelling narrative
2) To occasionally surprise me with a unique mechanical innovation in the context of the title
3) A core gameplay and progression loop that is rewarding and consistently fun to play until the end

Grounded has all these things and more.  The story is excellent, and Zachary Levi is a joy to listen to as it unfolds.  This point is doubly important for a survival/crafting game, the overwhelming majority of which don't appear to have any kind of coherent narrative at all, or at least one that's not delivered through collectibles.  The innovation in the context of a crafting game is so good, I can't imagine being able to stick with other survival titles unless they include some of the things I've seen here: Hot deposit of matching items into nearby containers, crafting from workstations using materials in nearby containers, freeform ziplines for large-scale world traversal, and more.  There is never any opportunity in this game to increase your inventory size, and I can't imagine that not being a deal breaker in any other survival game, but Grounded is inventive enough to make it work.  The core gameplay loop of examining parts from defeated yard creatures and constantly unlocking new gear until you become the yard's apex predator is also extremely satisfying.

My only gripe is that it may not appeal to the casual gamer, despite its easy-going aesthetic.  Some parts of it are just plain hard, especially if you're playing by yourself (and this is coming from a rabbid Souls fan).  Grab a friend for the optimal experience, but with or without companions it remains one of the best games I've ever played.

TL;DR - Mow the yard one blade at a time, kill car-sized spiders, Zachary Levi, what's not to love?",1691186772,1691186772,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I love the goofy setting and while the characters' voice lines do get annoying, I like that they're each individuals with their own thing to say.

The problem is that the progression feels like absolute ass. You start out way too weak to kill the bugs you need to kill in order to get upgrades. Perfect blocking is way too demanding (my reflexes are horrible, admittedly) and basically the only way to get by. Arrows feel utterly pathetic and do barely any damage to enemies, so trying to kill things ""safely"" from range is an absolute joke. Fundamentally nonsense concepts like needing a gas mask to kill a stink bug -- which drops the parts you need to craft a gas mask. It feels. Really. Bad.

Just absolutely needs to be rethought from the ground (lol) up, honestly. Which sucks, 'cause there's a lot of charm and a lot to love. But as it stands it's a miserable slog.",1613644597,1691123300,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[spoiler]I wish Valheim had that many options to let players customize the way they want to experience Valheim.[/spoiler]

Grounded also has many [i]quality of life[/i] things like you can quick deposit stuff into nearby chests and when you craft something materials get pulled out directly from containers nearby. To build structures you can place down blueprints first and complete it later and it is also very easy to just relocate any structure you build to another spot, this goes as far as allowing you to abuse this system to move full storage containers with you on the go. Just if you get hit while""holding"" the to-move item it is reset.

If you like builder type games, like Subnautica among others then I can only suggest you to take a look at Grounded. The one and only thing to watch out for is that the game can suck hours out of you just farming materials and building stuff. While it is possible to beat the game without building a big base, there are a couple ""defend the spot"" missions one being among the required last story missions which require you to build defenses. And for those you do need to a smal'ish base, which doesn't need to be ultra defended.

This review is for casual gamers, not the hardcore or the streamers. 

I play many survival crafting games. I don't think of myself as an expert, I view myself as a casual gamer who plays a lot - and always with others on coop. In other words, I represent the lay gamer who gets off the beaten path of big titles and who plays socially. 

Grounded probably has to be the best survival crafting game I've ever played. Even though I like the environment of Valheim better, the tranquility of Raft better, and the idea of Stranded Deep better - these are all aesthetic preferences. When it comes to considering which survival crafting game must actually be better in any objective sense, for me that has to be Grounded. Here is why:

First off, Grounded is just extremely well polished. Things work very well. It doesn't constantly crash. It had the feeling of a completed game even before 1.0 was released. Combat mechanics, for example, are excellent and offer a wide variety of builds and methods of setting up a team. 

Secondly, the amount of content in this game is incredible. At time of writing, I've sunk 136 hours into the game and could easily do that over again. Every time you think you've done it all, you find a load more you can do. The map is huge and extremely interesting, with nooks and crannies that will keep you surprised and excited for long hours. Are there things they didn't add that they could? Sure, but the fact that they're still doing just that brings me to my next point.

Devs won't quit. The fact that this game is still getting large updates, which meaningfully expand gameplay and content, is just really impressive. I wish many of the other games I play had the same kind of dedication and consistent updates. 

Huge potential for creativity. You can craft a lot of very cool and beautiful structures or bases. But a big difference with this game is that you can absolutely make them practical. Don't get me wrong, I'm a sucker for crafting projects for their own sake (E.g. my double upside down pyramid towers in Raft). But it's also really nice when you can put a lot of work into structures that you continue to use and benefit from. Our system of zipline towers connecting bases across the map has really made the game a lot more fun. My teammate and I really feel like we've built a networked empire across the map from which we can launch expeditions to whichever of the myriad of activities that the game offers. 

Freedom. The settings let you do a lot with the game that many comparable games don't. Want to change the color of the lights you just put up? Sure. Wanna pose for selfies with your friends after an accomplishment? Do it. 

Uniqueness. I've never seen a lot of the things the devs had added into this game. Seriously, I wish I could've sat in on their board meetings and listened to them brainstorm because I don't know how the heck you come up with this stuff. Shrunken teens collecting crow feathers and smashing loose human teeth scattered around the backyard with a hammer to unlock special stat points? Okey dokie. I'll be darned if it doesn't work though. Somehow all with a strange 80s vibe = extra points. If this sounds crazy, just try it and see if it doesn't somehow work seamlessly. 

I'm biased, but I'd say I recommend bringing a friend. This game is definitely better when you're building and exploring in a team or a pair, but I'm notorious for never playing single player so if that isn't you just disregard that.

10/10 would dive in the pond again.

If you want to explore a rich diverse game world - BUY THIS GAME.

But it does have some issues. 

I'm not a big fan of multi-player survival/explore/base build. I far prefer it be single player only. Just let me run around and get lost in the world. But there is multi player for this and some stuff that is definitely biased towards multi player (post end of story bosses as an example.) Can they be done solo? Sure - I've seen videos of it. Is it geared for that? Doesn't seem to be. Also things like getting the Coaltana or any of the MIX.R events seem very multi-player driven.

Getting from one Tier to the next Tier is an issue. To get to the next tier of gear you have to kill that tier's mobs with your current tier gear. As an example, to get your first Tier 2 items you have to kill Tier 2 mobs with your current Tier 1 gear. The movement from one tier to the next is not gradual. (Tier 2 to Tier 3 was worse.)

Upgrade materials for weapons would make that tier to tier jump more doable - but the upgrade items are rare (quartzite and marble) and they don't respawn.  By the time you are trying to get Tier 3 - you'll probably have it down. But when you're still new and don't know which items you should upgrade a bad choice might stick with you for a long time. 

I dislike CONSTANTLY having to hunt for food and fresh water. It's a constant burden in the Grounded world.

I also don't care for constantly having to repair weapons and gear. I managed to kill a couple of bees and make a related weapon! Yahoo for me! But then I found I was frequently hunting bees (not fun) to keep the weapon repaired. Tier 3 stuff gets easier - as it all repairs with 'glue'. But I spent a lot of time hunting and repeat killing the same mobs over and over to keep my gear repaired.

I don't mind some farming, even occasionally heavy farming. Grounded requires so much resource farming. Gathering clay, grass, weeds, etc. WAY too much farming.

The different types of weapons (slash, stab, chop, bash) combined with dmg types (spicy, fresh, salty, sour) is interesting. Until you have to carry 8 weapons with you everywhere to make sure you'll have one that works on whatever mobs you might encounter. 

Inventory space is WAY WAY WAY too limited. It gets better for storage at your base as the game progresses, but your carry space is always very limited. That is more of a problem when you have to carry lots of different gear all the time.

I will admit that the armor system is more than annoying, as well as, the way you heal.  The fact that you cannot set your gear to match your mutations and action bar is a big hole in the enjoyment factor.  The fact that there are only 4 variations of saved mutations is a shortfall with so many combinations of gear, mutations, consumables and so on.  Because of this, and if you want to maximize efficiency, you spend a lot of time messing with gear manually.  The fact that a trinket is in the same slot as a tuft is simply nonsense.  The staves charging option is very delayed and sometimes does not react properly.  Attacks are stored up very oddly, so that you can click three times, even when the action takes a very long time, the attacks still execute.  This was very odd for those who played with me as well.  The game is very choppy in this way though the fighting itself is relatively smooth.  Pets are another annoyance.  They are completely worthless in my opinion.  The noises they make, alone, make them better off dead.  And the worse part of the game, by far, is the friendly fire.  This is simply a disease that should have been cured day one but remains unless you lower the difficulty or make a custom game which disables achievements.  Building is another drain.  The way you carry grass blades, the structural height limitations, the lack of elevators, the lack of bridges, the way every resources spills out bounces and is collected individually is a pain after the millionth time of having to endure it, are all little annoyances that cause more frustration than I think they are worth.  There are so many interesting discoveries that making a few building adjustments would not remove the excitement of discovery in my opinion but streamline it.  They took away valid areas you used to be able to build before the full release, that was a pain.

However, the finished game has so much to do in finding gear, recipes, raw science, Sca.b, molars, etc.  The landscape is probably the most impressive part.  It is very well thought out.  The team that put it together deserve the love for this labor.  Other games will have areas which seem as if they should be for hidden rewards but they are empty and meaningless.  it seems like the Grounded team's purpose was to make every corner rewarding.  It was also very expansive in every direction, climbing the top of a wood pile or sandbox, descending to the depths of the ant hills or pond.   Very well done.  I really appreciate the voice acting as well.  It is not that gamers cannot read, but voice acting adds a level of intimacy in personalizing the story development.  Done well, which it was, and complete, you have a interactive and involved mission you want to be a part of, and otherwise, it can be a huge drain.  Again, very well done.  Not to give too much away, but the story ended happily.  That is a huge plus.  Others had suggested that the characters should have been, playable, large for a short while at the end of the story, giving it more closure, but it did not lack satisfaction in totality.  Again, the story was completed, the bad guys lost the good guys won, well done.",1625994018,1690424539,True,0,0,0.5,0,True,False,True

The enemies also lack moveset varieties. Once you've beaten Wolf spider, you basically seen every enemies in the game. The differences between low tier vs high tier mobs are HP and damage, which are basically artificial difficulty.    

If you don't have custom game enabled (disables achievement), I hope you enjoy spending 20min retrieving your items from halfway across the map during late game due to poor balancing, especially if [spoiler] you seal the haze cannister. [/spoiler]   

That being said, this game could be great if they introduce some more QoL features and tune down those late game mobs. The map is also handcrafted and gives similar exploration vibe to Subnautica. But right now, it's only recommended if you have friend(s) who can endure the stall-fest.

Grounded's core foundation is on being played together, 2 players or more and with each additional player it becomes easier. It regularly receives updates with new content and patches and is very easy to pick up and play at any time. Worlds can be hosted online for free to allow one player to play even while the other is away (Basically Minecraft Realms but free). It is a fantastic take on being shrunk down in the backyard and definetly takes inspiration from older movies. Definetly worth buying if your have someone else who is interested - you will not be dissapointed.

It's also only worth it if you have friends to play it with. 'Nuff said. Games made for multiplayer are best multiplayer.
You can play solo but it's more fun with friends, the balancing is better that way too. 

Difficulty: It's not extremely difficult once you get down the mechanics, but every enemy takes forever to kill. Wolf Spiders are essentially bosses in their own right, and the actual full blown bosses even harder. To be fair I am doing a punch only run (this game makes it lots of fun).

Yeah! It's a blast I love Zachary Levi and he's in this game as a VA. It's nice to occasionally hear that beautiful man's voice.

Multiplayer, crafting, survival, and a tiny bit of horror

Pros:
1. It's basically Honey I Shrunk the Kids but with a more interesting story
2. Base building is really satisfying
3. The map is wonderful and interesting
4. Looks great
5. Enemies are frightening

Cons:
1. You need to cheese enemies to progress. Glitch them out, find a ledge etc. Make sure you bring 1,000 arrows
2. Enemies can be unfair but don't act entirely like real insects. I'd mainly point out that spiders cant climb trees in the game...which actually turns out to be quite merciful.
3. Things can get glitchy

if you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding Chilli con carne recipe you've come to the right place,

Ingredients

1 large onion
1 red pepper
2 garlic cloves
1 tbsp oil
1 heaped tsp hot chilli powder (or 1 level tbsp if you only have mild)

1 tsp paprika
1 tsp ground cumin
500g lean minced beef
1 beef stock cube
400g can chopped tomatoes
½ tsp dried marjoram
1 tsp sugar (or add a thumbnail-sized piece of dark chocolate along with the beans instead, see tip)

2 tbsp tomato purée
410g can red kidney beans
plain boiled long grain rice, to serve
soured cream, to serve

Directions

STEP 1
Prepare your vegetables. Chop 1 large onion into small dice, about 5mm square. The easiest way to do this is to cut the onion in half from root to tip, peel it and slice each half into thick matchsticks lengthways, not quite cutting all the way to the root end so they are still held together. Slice across the matchsticks into neat dice.

STEP 2
Cut 1 red pepper in half lengthways, remove stalk and wash the seeds away, then chop. Peel and finely chop 2 garlic cloves.

STEP 3
Start cooking. Put your pan on the hob over a medium heat. Add 1 tbsp oil and leave it for 1-2 minutes until hot (a little longer for an electric hob).

STEP 4
Add the onion and cook, stirring fairly frequently, for about 5 minutes, or until the onion is soft, squidgy and slightly translucent.

STEP 5
Tip in the garlic, red pepper, 1 heaped tsp hot chilli powder or 1 level tbsp mild chilli powder, 1 tsp paprika and 1 tsp ground cumin.

STEP 6
Give it a good stir, then leave it to cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.

STEP 7
Brown 500g lean minced beef. Turn the heat up a bit, add the meat to the pan and break it up with your spoon or spatula. The mix should sizzle a bit when you add the mince.

STEP 8
Keep stirring and prodding for at least 5 minutes, until all the mince is in uniform, mince-sized lumps and there are no more pink bits. Make sure you keep the heat hot enough for the meat to fry and become brown, rather than just stew.

STEP 9
Make the sauce. Crumble 1 beef stock cube into 300ml hot water. Pour this into the pan with the mince mixture.

This great chilli recipe has to be one of the best dishes to serve to friends for a casual get-together. An easy sharing favourite that uses up storecupboard ingredients.

The atmosphere, the difficulty, the progression, the weapons are everything I wanted. At night, I feel the danger and when the game gets easy, it slaps you in the face with a new area. Amazing atmosphere and a game I am actually wanting some DLC for. this game is complete, one of the most complete survival crafting games and definitely the most complete 3d survival crafting game. The game's hot deposit is pretty good and the shared world is a wonderful addition that all games should have. If you have 4 players in the world, the game can allow any user to host and grind on their own. Shared world means that all players can grind, turn off the server, and anybody else can pickup the game where the other left off. This completely removes any jank with using a shared dropbox or google cloud save and sharing with your friends. Upgrades are meaningful and there are times when  I have to sit down and think about how to approach enemies or what mutations work best here.


Some cons
- QOL is needed, especially gardening
- Multiplayer can be a bit weird, dew drops being fake, buildings arent filled in until you hit it or something. syncing.
- The building system is just OK, its not clunky, but theres no real reason to innovate or push yourself to build interesting bases. no redstone or any other electricity to push the envelope.
- More bosses are needed especially in the early game.
- buffs are visible but lack any % or tangible numbers. sometimes we have to go to the wiki to find out what certain trinkets do or the % on mutations.

A game that concept wise feels straight out of a children's movie, be prepared for a heart attack rougher than any zombie or mutant jumpscare when you hear the cry of an angry wolfspider. 

A 9/10 experience
 
Difficulty 6/10 (Bosses being significantly harder)
Visually 9/10 (The Stylization is amazing!)
Gameplay 10/10 (There is always something to do, feels fluid and the system compliment each other very well)
Story 7/10 (Solid, not the most exciting but i found it very funny) 


A survival sandbox game with an amusing twist. Much like any other, you need shelter, food and water to survive. Playing as one of four kids that have been shrunk, your average garden just became a terrifying fight for survival. Spiders, mites and other creepy crawlies are out to get you! Fight your way through abandoned laboratories and uncover secrets, or take on the meanest of the bugs in epic boss battles, or maybe you fancy yourself an interior designer. The game provides fun for all, easy, normal, hard or creative if you prefer to just build fantastical bases. It is very much a game that rewards curiosity and exploration. 

Grounded has a fun and whimsical story that sends you discovering old laboratories left by an eccentric scientist. The vibe is light hearted and very much fitting the children's movie vibe. Each lab is located in tough to reach areas and often require you to at least get some gear before taking on the challenge. Each lab provides a reward, be it unlocking new areas or quality of life upgrades. 

As a casual player I found the combat to be reasonably challenging, it feels responsive and it's easy to aim your strikes. Blocking is a core mechanic, and with practice and good timing most bugs are now easily overcome. The game does an amazing job building your confidence as you progress. Dying means dropping your backpack, meaning your items can be retrieved. However keep in mind where you venture, you might not be able to get it back as easily as you were hoping. The game is also great at providing variety, you can take on the challenges of the garden with a whole bunch of weapons, axes, daggers ,hammers, spears or even just your fist. Each bug having weaknesses and resistances forces you to carry at least a few different weapons in order to survive. 

The mechanics are easy to learn, but they are more in depth that is what is described. The game does a poor job teaching you about new things at times. Armors give passives, and sets give an even better passive, sometimes the passives are needed to progress as well. And unlocking upgrades can be a guessing game unless you have the wiki next to you. At times I was left clueless as to what the next step was. However most of the time it meant that I had not dared to explore the deeper parts of the garden. 

Overall, this is an amazing experience, I reckon around 150 hours is enough to soak in the entire experience but in any sandbox game. The game is what you make it, I have yet to complete my base and take on the hardest of bosses. Better yet, the game is still getting updates and content is added somewhat frequently. For me it's the stylized approach, with upgrade systems, weapon variations and armor passives that gives this game an amazing variety in playstyles.

soundtrack: 7.5/10
combat: 7.0/10 (lot of weapons and armors to choose, kinda feel like ""insect hunter backyard"")
game play: 8.5/10 (9.0 if without following bugs)
(
- the explore is super fun, almost addicting to me
- insects are really well designed and pretty scary to make game exciting and interesting
- tons of content to offer that I just finished 75% of it for 50 hours
- you can also build sweet house for a break

- Steam achievement is not working when not login xbox account
- escape key stops working sometimes after reload save file
- underwater lab exploring is quite annoying because of running out of air constantly
- jump scare Antlion (in sandbox)
- hitbox broken in Ladybird and Rolly polly
- poison is annoyingly op
)
over all: 8.0/10 (I really enjoy it)

I was having multiplayer mode login issue (many threads that people had same problem back in 2020 are still active with new player asking for help, which shows how lazy these devs are). I finally find out it is ""XBox Networking"" problem:
1. type ""Xbox networking"" in win10 search bar, click the best match
2. it shows the problem is ""Teredo is unable to qualify"" and ""server is blocked""

After searched ""Teredo is unable to qualify"" and test with many solutions, I was able to fix the problem by:
1. type ""Computer Management"" in search bar, click the best match
2. go to ""Services and Applications"" -> ""Services"", make sure the service ""IP Helper"" is running
3. type ""Edit group policy"" in search bar, click the best match
4. go to ""Computer Configuration"" -> ""Administrator Templates"" -> ""Network"" -> ""TCPIP Settings"" -> ""IPv6 Transition Technologies""
5. click ""Set Teredo State"", and set ""Enable"" and states to ""Enterprise Client""
6. click ""Set Teredo Server Name"", and set server name to ""win10.ipv6.microsoft.com""
(
these are all server names provided, change if one of them not help:
-- teredo.remlab.net
-- teredo2.remlab.net
-- teredo.iks-jena.de (this is best for me)
-- win10.ipv6.microsoft.com
-- teredo.ipv6.microsoft.com
-- teredo.trex.fi
)
7. finally check teredo state using CMD: ""netsh interface Teredo show state"". the result should be look like this:
(
-- Type                                : enterpriseclient (Group Policy)
-- Server Name                   : win10.ipv6.microsoft.com (Group Policy)

There is some minor issues with physics based items and building / building components. Takes a lot of resources on GPU's and CPU's. My friend has a PC a few years older than mine, started with a 2060Ti (Medium settings) and he was only able to get 45fps average in Base Areas and peak of 65 in open world. I upgraded him to a 4070Ti, he maxed settings to Epic and he was able to get at least 65fps in our most densest built base and anywhere between 120-150fps in the open world. Physics based areas like the Charcoal Grill he was only getting about 35fps even with a 4070Ti due to his 9700KF 8-Core CPU.

My PC - 4070Ti and 12700KF 12-Core CPU - Our densest base I got about 90fps, open world 140-180fps with everything maxed out. Physics was the only issue I had beside a few random crashes or disconnects (not related to steam outages).

my only concern lately is that my game has been laggy, and after trying to troubleshoot and asking various people about it, someone mentioned that dropped items don't despawn (ex. items the player drops, or grass and stems cut down but not recovered). (or at least they don't despawn very quick) because of this it all piles up and makes the game lag

i would love an option under the 'game fix' tab to 'clean up entities' or something of the sorts. i'm not sure of the logistics, since naturally spawning items can be entities as well, but the game really needs it q0q

However, the multiplayer uses XBox Live, and logging in is hit or miss. It should be a simple matter to connect to a friend and play together. Getting it running was clunky. We finally got it running, though, and had fun. Then, in the little time I have during my busy schedule, we sit down to play again, and it says I have to login to the XBox Network. I click the button. The logging in sign circles for about a second and disappears. I am not logged in. I repeat this multiple times. Same thing happens. No error message. I can't find anything online specific to this issue, though some people say multiplayer was broken with the latest update. I try logging out of XBox Live and logging back in. I try rebooting my computer. No dice. My daughter is able to log in, though. I should be able to sit down and play this game with her without this waste of time. Hey, Obsidian, make this simple and robust! This frustration is making me very negative about a game that otherwise is enjoyable.

Edit: Okay, I was able to fix the problem. I had to go into the Xbox App and unlink my Steam account. Then, when I opened Grounded again, it brought up a brand new login prompt. Here's how I did it:

1. Open App
2. Click username in top left corner
3. Click settings
4. You should be on the account page. Scroll down to Linked accounts.
5. Click unlink on the Steam account.
6. Now start up Grounded and log in.

Hope this helps someone. Fun game, but this is ridiculous. If they streamline the process and make it simpler to connect to friends, I will change this review, because I like the game in general.",1689645372,1689647251,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Good base building.

Con's
Not sure what is with the Xbox menu, I have to play offline solo because I don't use Xbox.
Multiplayer doesn't seem intuitive, really wish that was flushed out better.

I am only 30 hours in, but so far its been very fun.  I am probably still in whats considered the early game, just barely killed a few spiders and flying creatures.  Looking forward to more.

Rating: ★★★★★ (5/5)

I can confidently say that Grounded is one of the most exceptional multiplayer experiences I've had in years. Teaming up with two friends, we were instantly transported into a world where everything felt surreal and intriguingly small. The game's atmosphere, paired with its vast maps, truly immerses players in the feeling of being shrunken down to the size of insects.

One of the standout features of Grounded is its breathtaking environments. The world is a masterpiece, full of wonders to explore and secrets to uncover. The attention to detail is astounding, and it's genuinely remarkable how the game designers managed to make even the tiniest nooks and crannies captivating.

Furthermore, the consistent flow of updates that keep changing and enhancing the gaming experience. The developers' commitment to improving the game based on player feedback is commendable, and as improved our gaming experience even that far off the release date of the game. 

Grounded was an absolute blast to play with my friends. The progression system is exceptionally well-designed, creating a perfect balance of challenge and reward. The desire to improve our gear wasn't just a meaningless grind; it directly impacted our survival chances. This added a layer of motivation and meaning to our cooperative efforts.

From exploring the lush greenery of the backyard to navigating the treacherous terrain of the garden, each location is uniquely crafted to keep players engaged and excited.

The charming characters in Grounded perfectly balance fun and relatability. Whether it's engaging in witty banter or navigating challenging situations, their personalities add a not always so subtle depth to the overall experience.

Moreover, the game's intriguing storyline is a driving force that keeps players coming back for more. As we unraveled the mysteries of the tiny world, the desire to uncover its secrets became irresistible. The narrative adds a sense of purpose to the gameplay, elevating the overall enjoyment.

Grounded is the epitome of a multiplayer game that requires cooperation and planning while still maintaining a lighthearted feel. The laughs, the challenges, and the triumphant moments we shared as a team are memories I'll cherish for a long time.",1689513647,1689513647,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Your PC is a actual character with dialogue and a personality a part of this 4man team and your gameplay style will evolve depending on what the group wants to do. Music and sound is incredibly satisfying and at times perspective really feels like you are as small as Olimar and you feel this larger world in front of you.

The unique areas of the giant map, atmospheric music, crazy bug sounds, crafting, inventory management, etc. ...It's all just solidly put together and surprisingly nostalgic for the ""Honey I Shrunk the Kids"" generation.

The story is goofy, but perfectly fits the charm of the world. Gameplay progresses forward at a nice pace to keep things challenging even into end game content. So much to do, explore, and of course, the base building.

We're talking about a bug's-eye view of a suburban backyard, and let me tell you, it's jaw-dropping. Each blade of grass is like a towering tree, and tiny pebbles are massive boulders – everything feels gigantic! And don't even get me started on the bugs. They've got these bugs down to a tee, from tiny little ants to huge, terrifying spiders (yeah, arachnophobes beware!).

Next up, the whole vibe of the game is spot on. It’s like you’ve been zapped into Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, and it's a wild ride. The ambiance is just something else - chilling beneath a leaf in the shadowy afternoon or being out in the open when the sunlight's beaming down, it's strangely soothing yet creepy at the same time.

Now, let's talk gameplay. As a casual gamer, I’ve gotta say, Grounded hits the sweet spot. It's got all the survival stuff - collecting things, crafting gear, building your micro fortress - it's a full plate. And the bugs aren't just for show, you’ll be fighting them off too. Each insect is a unique fight, so you gotta stay on your toes. And if you have buddies to join you, it’s a riot! But trust me, even playing solo is an absolute blast.

The story's not completely there yet, but it's getting intriguing. It's like they're teasing out a mystery about why you're so tiny and stuck in this place. Feels kinda like being in an adventure novel, except you're the main character.

Sure, there are a few rough edges. Sometimes the bugs (I mean the software ones, not the giant ants) can be a pain, like when a spider gets stuck in a rock or something. But honestly, it doesn't mess with the fun all that much. They've got the big things so right that the small glitches just kinda blend in.",1689256884,1689256884,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

BUT it is a genuinely good time. The first few hours in the game, being tiny and starving and dying of dehydration, are wildly most effective than most survival games I've played. The scale at first comes off as a gimmick, but after fighting off the first successful spider the feeling of success is enormous. I was on on my second set of armor and tools when I killed one on my own, no cheesing, just a fair fight. A giant orb weaver attacking our base in the dead of night and I was the only one any where near the house. It was after that I realized that the sizing and scale had a bigger impact than I realized. That spider felt like an insurmountably large monster even though he was only maybe two to three times the size of my player character and as far as video game bosses go that's not very large. The game had worked hard to make me afraid of it anyways, to make the player literally feel small. Just so I could conquer it.

Also there was no way I wasn't going to die defending our beautiful two story home with a cozy chimney and adorable clover leaf roof shingles. The base buildings pretty good.",1689247614,1689247614,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The building mechanic is amazing and combat system is funny and fun but the exploring part I don't really like. The whole thing with exploring is to walk around until you find this. But other then that its a stupid fun game with a lot of bugs. Also red ants suck. They just steal from you and sometimes raid you. At least they give decent weapons.

Edit: What I said before about the combat isn't true. Its basically get timing right to take no damage and spam mouse 1. Also there is a lot of bugs and not the insects. Sometimes I find my pet weevil stuck in the ground. Its usally whenever I adventure far away. Also pet houses are stupid expensive. You can get an pet with like tier 1 stuff while for the house you need a tier 2 axe. So I have mixed feelings about this game.

Edit 2: Combat is wayy more fun than what i said before. I literately killed a orb weaver with just a pebblet spear with my friend.",1667091662,1689181303,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is similar to Deep Rock Galactic, in which one of the main objectives is to eliminate hostile insects in order to progress and reach higher levels of gear. The different ranges of bugs, weaponry, and armor made the first few hours enjoyable and interesting until a lot of the major issues with the game started to show:

1) Poor Optimization 

This game is poorly optimized. For the level of detail it offers this game should not be this demanding. I run a RTX 3050ti with 16GB of ram and a Ryzen 7 6800H. I had this game on lowest settings 1080p and had to even bring the resolution scale down to 80%. I was averaging ~70fps. This is really really bad. 

2) Limited Map/Level Design

The map design overall felt like it lacked effort. It felt like all the different kinds of insects and resources were just scattered around with no apparent difference in ambience or anything special linked to a certain type of insect. 
Three examples of better ambience: 

1- The red fire ants could have some kind of nest that is on fire adding environmental challenges while in engagement with them. This would push the player to engage from longer distances.

2- Black Widow Spiders could live in fog only areas limiting the players visibility and not allowing the spider to be seen until the last second. This would force players to switch to a more tanky gear set etc.

BONUS- You could have random events throughout the map such as a huge lawnmower going over the map cutting the tops of the grass cause you know people cut their grass (this wouldn't harm the player as the blade would be above their height but they could take small amounts of damage if they stood under it for a while). Or something like an insect migration.

This is a game it doesn't have to reflect reality just make things interesting and spicy for the player. Sure it is great that each insect has weaknesses but it isn't enough. The way the game is right now takes away the feeling of: ""Wow I just discovered a new type of insect I wonder what is the best way of fighting it."" Right now it's like this: ""Cool a new insect let me check its weak spots and what weapons deal more damage to it and farm them until I can make the higher tier tool the harvests provide."" It was like this for each new insect and it got very repetitive very fast. Rather every insect should be a surprise to the player. Since there isn't much emphasis on the story and this game has no PVP elements the only thing keeping the player hooked is progression and surprising environmental challenges/events like the ones mentioned above.

3) Tanky Insects

The insects are way too strong! Me and my friends played on medium difficulty and the insects had way too much health. The worst part is they also barely drop enough for you to craft the higher tier weapons using their body parts. This was the worst! If you are gonna make tanky enemies you have to make them rewarding to fight. If you are gonna make them drop very little they must be less tanky! Me and my friends were in this constant cycle of dying to the same insect and farming the same insect until we were able to craft the higher tier gear. It was painful. There must be some kind of balance. Perhaps an option is to increase player HP! Additionally killing an insect should be more satisfying. All insects have the same animation. They roll onto their back and freeze in place until you harvest them. Add some variance some spice for God's sake.

Summary: Surely this game is not completely horrible. The inventory mechanics are nice, building is fun/fast, and the fact that you can gain an advantage over insects by building towers and whatnot is also nice. Some parts of the game are quite solid such as movement, physics, ragdolls, weapon animations, and gear design. BUT. I do not agree with the price. Overall, this game did not meet my expectations at all with the price range it is at. Without any discount this game is $40 dollars. I am sorry but this game can be at most valued at $20 max with what it is putting on the table! Anything more than that is overvaluation. If you are going to purchase this game I would say wait for a discount of more than 50%!!!",1686894630,1688881919,False,3,3,0.494170993566513062,0,True,False,False

These issues were already in the game since beta and for a 40$ game marketed as a fun co-op experience it is unacceptable that they are still in the game 3 years later.

The bugs too are very problematic and then I don't mean the npc enemies. No I'm talking about water droplets getting stuck in the air untill you restart the game (you can't survive without these). Enemies can sometimes clip through terrain and attack you, you and npc can sometimes randomly teleport short distances which can get you killed if you're near a cliff/boss. This game has quite some game breaking bugs and feels more like an early access game than an actual product.

That aside the actual gameplay is pretty fun, the bugs look great and the fluff is pretty fun. Grounded can be worth it on sale but definetly not for full price.",1688799203,1688799203,False,2,0,0.487924396991729736,0,True,False,False

With its ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"" premise, it exceeds expectations by offering a stunningly creative and consistently funny adventure. Drawing inspiration from RPG mechanics, the game combines scavenging, crafting, building, combat, exploration, and character progression. The sandbox-like backyard environment is beautifully designed, with each area presenting its own unique challenges and personality. The game strikes a great balance between making you feel on your own and introducing quirky characters. The story, although not always at the forefront, is utterly ridiculous and laugh-out-loud funny.

1. The biggest issue by FAR is that everyone in the game (except the host) gets disconnected every 15 minutes, and then in order to rejoin you have to completely close and restart the game. Your mileage may vary but if I wasn't playing this game with my significant other (they host the game so I am constantly DCed) I would have absolutely stopped playing after the first hour or so. This issue by itself completely ruins the game for me, and makes it impossible to just enjoy it for what it is. 

2. The pet system is buggy (pun intended), unreliable and frustrating. My partner was super excited about getting pets in-game, but soon after getting her first one, it kept getting stuck whenever they would go exploring. To get it back, she would have have to run all the way across the map to get it unstuck, only for it to get stuck AGAIN on the way back. Then, to make matters infinitely worse, it somehow got itself stuck INSIDE the terrain, making it totally unable to be rescued or killed. Now she cannot have another pet of that type at all, despite hours of walking around hoping it would teleport next to her and somehow unstuck itself. This issue was so unfun for us (especially in combination with the first issue) that we almost stopped playing entirely despite otherwise enjoying the game.

If these issues are fixed (or you dont experience them), the game is good. It is a real shame that our experience with this game was tarnished by such frustrating issues, as otherwise I think it would have been a great time. We will likely continue to play until we finish the story, as we have already invested significant time in this game, but given this knowledge I would not have chosen to play this game initially.

It is an open world sandbox that has a story that is intriguing and different. The Art style is immersive and for some reason gives off vibes of days when I was a kid and could sit down and play my N64 for hours. The only thing that I wish is that this game implemented seasons where the weather could change over a period of time spent in the game. I feel as though if that were somehow an option it could make the game better (some would even argue it could make it worse and I could see that as well)

The overall combat is simplistic and easy for anyone to grasp. The progression is easy to follow and you must be willing to understand that creatures have weaknesses just as much as they have strengths and weapons and armor will either work with you or against you depending on what you are up against. The quest (storyline) in the game don't seem monotonous. There is always something to do. The game challenges you appropriately as you continue through the more difficult areas of the yard. 

Although I sometimes question BURG.Ls quest on the side for collecting raw science. You need so much of the raw science if you want to buy everything from the shop. I feel as though there could have been a bit more on variety of tasks you can do to earn that extra raw science. Like what if they could opt in for more Base Defense with your OWN base at risk that would be cool instead of going out and fighting a ton of either gnats, wolf spiders, orb weavers, weavils, or ladybugs to get the extra raw science needed to buy the extra items from the shop. The game already does base defense, why not make it more rewarding. What if they could somehow detect that if they do not touch your base at all then you get extra raw science for warding them off? 

I won't spoil the bosses here, but yes they are very challenging. I do like that in a game. I like the fact that they are challenging and difficult to take on and that you need to rely on your armor strengths just as much as your weapon strength to get you through. Recipes, Foods, and Trinkets in the game make it more unique. 

I will still continue to play this game many times over just because every time you go into the backyard there is a really good sense that the game is going to be entertaining and fun. Very good survival game. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. 

Devs: I must say that compared to most developers, Obsidian actually follows through and updates their game. I played this when it was first dropped. Since then, this game has been released in finished form. Compared to other survival games that are still in early access that have been out well before Grounded, I have to tip my hat to them for updating and being incredibly consistent.",1688670254,1688670254,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I was expecting it to be one I would enjoy playing again and again but with how combat and things are late to end game it just was not enjoyable at all. I can understand bosses need to be hard and stuff but when you have to master perfect block, know all the weaknesses off the top of your head to each bug, and max out gear and skills just to have a chance at beating bosses....kinda to much of a grind.

So the upsides to the game
Great soundtrack
Great visuals
Alright story

Bad things about the game....
Combat gets quite hard late to end game even with best stuff
game is a hard grind for some material types that being building a big base or craving good armor and weapons,
game dose have big frame rate drops depending on what is going on example harvesting a bug and its parts lay around (not talking about items laying on ground just the visual parts breaking off and spraying bug blood)
end game bugs and bosses being quite hard to beat.
way to big a gap difference from easy and normal
normal feeling like hard mode late game
Game breaking bugs still in the game (looking at sandbox skeleton missing from game along with log files....)

All in all the start of the game was great...but as time went on the charm too faded hard to were it was to much a chore to really do the end game stuff....yah was able to get a save file that did it all to not only save on the hassle the game was throwing at me but to also get past the game breaking bug.

If you do still go ahead and get the game my advice just play it to beat it...don't 100% unless they fix the bugs...and if normal is to hard just drop to easy its more enjoyable to make progress then get pissed being stuck on the same boss for a few hours or mixer event",1688620802,1688620802,False,7,1,0.488171160221099854,0,True,False,False

But I'm going to give thumbs down for being an obvious Early Access game that is probably for some very amazing and good reason not in EA anymore.

The lack of polish is apparent. 
Here are some examples from my multiplayer experiences so far:

-There are some specific things that desync (maybe they are broken in singleplayer too, I dont know), like dew droplets and construction. Sometimes constructed building parts like foundations, floors and walls after construction stay in ""building mode"" for some players. The fix is to reconnect to the game. Sometimes it breaks for the host too so you need to restart the server. Similarly dew droplets that are desynced stay so until server reset.

-There is at least one almost game-breaking bug that causes enemies called ""Gnats"" to disappear on contact with water and sometimes with ground and leave no loot, that was found quite some time ago (earliest mention I found was in April of 2021), of which the devs are apparently aware of according to reddit and steam, and it's still not fixed. What makes this bug almost game-breaking is that these enemies are an early-game enemy for resources to progress in your game further, and this bug makes it exceedingly hard to gain resources from them, given that they are usually located close to water as well. 

-There is an Ant hive where the ants are all stacked at the entrance but there is basically 0 ants inside. What? Maybe if there is a lore reason I missed from one of those cassettes, this is a non-issue.

-Looting or the looting prompt is bugged. More often than not, it's a pain trying to pick up anything. Sometime things you break into pieces or stuff that drops require you to be in some ""correct angle"" or just keep tapping until the item is picked up. It's not very fluid looting when you're trying to pick up a piece of grass for 5 seconds.

-Construction needs a ton of polish. From desyncs to lack of variety in parts to better mix&match compatibility between parts.

-Information dumps. There are some NPC monologues (at least one), that last for quite many minutes unless skipped. It's good to have lore you can read and some immersive dialogue.  A huge plus for voice-acting. But really does the thing have to tell us 2 light novels worth of information on first contact? It gets jarring especially in multiplayer when most players just stop caring after the first 3 sentences. And also most people really forget the information from the beginning of the monologue by the time it's ended so you achieved nothing.

It's still an Early Access game and should be treated as such.

It's worth it on a sale and with friends, but I'm starting to really dislike publishers/devs that just depend solely on the fact that their half-baked ""non-EA but actually EA"" games are good with friends. Even a burnt baguette is good entertainment with friends.",1688334438,1688567535,False,1,0,0.460063904523849487,0,True,False,False

Obsedian has made many updates to the game since it's early alpha stage and each update adds more content and improvements. This game has everything; an excellent base building tool, various fighting/character builds, a variety in scenery and landscapes with different approaches to explore these area's.  An interesting and compelling story and many bugs to fight with different fighting styles.

Tried again... I get kicked again a few minutes later. The Multiplayer is broken and I have no reason to play it otherwise.

I'm actually not even 100% finished, I've still yet to face the Wasp Queen and Infected Brood mother optional bosses. At the start I played a shared world with my boyfriend. He wanted achievements so he had to put it down to mild to avoid friendly fire without making a custom game. He also found the spiders too difficult and while I wanted the difficulty to stay at normal at first, friendly fire really sucks on higher difficulties for non-custom games so we stuck with mild. 

It was a joy to explore this unique, hand crafted set of levels. There's incredible motivation to go out and explore. Your job is basically to unshrink and to do that you need to find and explore shrunken down labs which each have their own challenges, insect infestations, incredible deep water, toxic gas, etc. Furthermore you need to take care of your day to day needs as well, you need to build shelter, have systems for food and water, and build better and better equipment for yourself. All of these systems are tied seamlessly and enticingly with exploration and combat. Finding new bugs to fight grants you new parts to craft weapons and armor, they give you more cooking recipes and more convenient ways to eat and drink. 

The combat is somewhat unexpected for this, it requires some reflexes, especially for spider like enemies, if you're bad at timing blocks you might want to lower the difficulty or even make a custom game to help yourself out. I really enjoyed it, I started out with a larva dagger which is really a sword and then moved on to the spider dagger, a real sword and shield combo. It was incredibly fast and its poison melted enemies quickly who didn't resist it. Enemies have weaknesses, resistances, and elements like spicy, fresh, sour, and salty take the place of fire, ice, lightning, and earth. 

The characters and story are intriguing as well, I don't want to give even a bit of it away, but this game is just incredible. Everything you do ties together in a satisfying way so no matter what you choose to do you're always making some kind of exciting progress. Cleverly there are optional areas that motivate you to explore them not just from their visual interest but because you can always find something new there. Indeed, many of these optional areas have some of the best weapon and armor recipes available to you. 

While not as important, I have to mention how amazing the graphics are. I don't have the most powerful computer so it kind of chugs near my base once in a while but outside of tightly designed and object loaded player housing my 3050 (laptop, so like a 1660 really) and my i5 at 4.1 ghz with 32 gb of ram worked out perfectly fine at max settings in the yard. The yard itself is a sight to behold, plants show transparency to light, water looks perfect, lighting is breath taking. Character models and enemies are stylized but don't clash and work incredibly well with the style chosen. 

If you like Minecraft but wanted it to look like it's modded realistically, don't mind the building being more restrictive, but want more interesting combat and a more tailored experience for exploration with easier co-op, this is a fantastic choice. I will most likely go back with other friends and do a custom game. I'll probably go and finish the Wasp Queen and the Infected Broodmother at some point later. I couldn't get enough of this game and all I wanted to do in my free time is play it more and more and more.

Firstly all but one of the mandatory boss fights feel unnecessarily difficult in ways which do not feel 'fair' Namely for the first boss [spoiler] the arena is much too small, and the flood of Adds make it difficult to deal with the Towers effects, in addition to this The laser tower can take you from full health to dead nearly instantly. [/spoiler]
secondly all flying insects are incredibly annoying to fight if you do not keep a ranged weapon with you, and all armor that gives a bonus to the ranged options provide the least defense
and finally the game Distinctly feels as though it is meant to be played in co op with at least one other person. there are numerous moments through out the game where so many bugs are thrown at you at once that I genuinely dont know if its possible to do solo within a reasonable time frame, and the only way i was able to get through some of these was by [i] both [/i] lowering the difficulty [i] and [/i] making 3 to 4 layer thick mushroom brick walls.

If you are after this game EXCLUSIVELY for multiplayer coop with friends, take caution. There is a bug ongoing with this game where the invited player will be kicked after 10 minutes. Not everyone will have this bug occur at all but in a lot of cases the bug will appear suddenly after an update and there is no proper fix for it that the community have found. So if it's multiplayer exclusively, just be aware that you might not end up able to multiplay. 
Hoping that Obsidian Games will eventually fix this fault, but at present it's been at least a year since people have been having this trouble and no communication has been made by the developers about whether there will be an attempted fix in the future. It doesn't look hopeful at present.

However, if you are playing this as single player for the story only, then it works fine and is an enjoyable little wander through the world.

Have you ever seen ""Honey, I shrunk the kids.""? Well this game is basically that. You're small, like really small. You are close to the same size as a regular ant. It allows for some great immersion as the environments and enemies are so big but you can establish that you're just in someone's yard. The game does a great job at making you feel so small by being relentless with the enemies, especially spiders, but don't worry, if you're arachnophobic the game has a setting to make the spiders less real. 

The crafting is great and definitely will scratch that itch of survival for many. It absolutely did for me and still does. Also hunger and thirst is a constant part of the game and imo is done very well. At first you're struggling to find a steady supply of clean water, food not so much as there are plenty of mushrooms and smaller bugs that you can find to eat. As such you have to settle for dirty water that makes you sick and gains you a sick level. Depending on your sick level, after drinking such water your hunger meter will drain accordingly. So you have to be careful not to drink too much unclean water or you will be at risk of starving to death. But the sick levels do go away with rest. Eventually you will learn how to collect dew and make a canteen to hold clean water and life in the game will get easier. 

Fighting bugs is a challenge, but grounded does a good job of letting you know the weaknesses of the enemies via the peek system where you literally peek at the enemy type and press a button to load them in your database. But sometimes avoiding bugs is necessary as in the early part of the game you will not stand a chance. Grounded does a good job of showing you enemies that you need to work towards eventually being able to take on, which allows for a great rewarding feeling when you start to get the hang of things. 

9.5 out of 10

This game inspired me to get a bug oriented arm tattoo and I didn't even like bugs that much!

Its a big call, but I might have to say that this game was one of, if not my most favourite game I've ever played.
I'm pretty notorious for getting lost in maps in games, never has a game been more rewarding to literally ""get lost"" and discover something new. 

I genuinely feel Grounded ticked and exceeded nearly all of the boxes.
I thoroughly enjoyed all of the crafting and building in the game.
The combat was challenging but equally, if not exceedingly rewarding.
Taking down our first wolf spider at the start of the game was one of the most terrifying experiences. 
You cant help but feel a little confident later in the game when you're taking them on by yourself with an axe but that confidence doesn't last too long as there's always the next challenge around the corner. 

I think the thing that I enjoyed the most about this game was that it was not only enjoyable for me as a player but my coop buddies who both have different play styles to me really enjoyed it too. We all got satisfaction out of the game in our own ways. Having fun together and over coming feats that initially seem impossible kept us in this game for many many hours with many tequila celebratory shots had.

My only small negative feedback is some de-syncing issues that cause some objects in the environment to be there (or not) for a joiner, but on the most part we were able to work around these issues because everything else was so enjoyable. 

In conclusion, Grounded isn't just a game. It's an insect-infused adventure that will make you question your phobias, marvel at the wonders of the miniature world, and create unforgettable memories with your friends <3.",1687966308,1687966308,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The biggest thing i complement the game on is the challenge of the grind, I have not reached a point where this game has become too easy. From the very beginning almost every insect will kick your ass, as you find new materials and bug parts you unlock new crafting options, as you upgrade your equipment you can branch out and explore more of the yard. The further you explore away from the starting area the more difficult the insects become constantly keeping you on your toes. Another aspect of the game i enjoy is the terror you feel when you are quietly roaming around and you hear this terrifying screech causing you to jump scare, especially if you're exploring during the night.

It's much easier to get into, inventory has a sort button now, and, in general, the game does an ok job at introducing you into the basics, and does a good job at stopping the hand holding pretty soon thereafter (which is preferable, afterall, the map is static, the point is to explore).  

If you like base building/exploration/crafting games, this is up your alley.

[b]Hardware/performance:[/b]
With a 5900x, RTX3080ti and 32gb ram at 3600mhzCL16, performance with QHD/""Epic quality"" generally ranges between 100-144fps, often finding itself hovering near 120fps. The game looks [i]gorgeous[/i], and one of the few games where depth of field is actually desirable to help immerse yourself in the scale of the game (you're very small!). No RTX/raytracing here, it's pure raster. Sadly there's no built in benchmarking tool.

Grabbed this at 29.99CAD in June 2023 (40%off sale). RRP right now is $49.99CAD. Hope this is helpful for folks who put this kind of information in deal alert sites.

I have played this game since the launch day of the first beta, and now that I have nearly gotten through the full release of the game, I can say without a doubt that Obsidian has managed to craft a masterpiece by listening to their audience and giving us a game we can enjoy and connect with. Never before have I been so immersed in a video game's world before, even compared to Half-Life 2, Left 4 Dead 2, and Fallout 3. The story is incredibly deep, and tells a narrative of a man who has lost everything, a stark but well-deserved contrast to the rest of the game's world being somewhat happy. The soundtrack is memorable and gives a good backing to all the fights of the game, allowing you to vividly remember them by just listening to the songs on their own. The combat is excellent, the building potential is large, and the amount of general stuff that can be done is impressive for a map that feels admittedly small.

Overall, Grounded is a truly challenging, rewarding, and enthralling experience that I have poured hours into over and over again, and will continue to support in the future.",1625803698,1687648232,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

You'll spend a significant portion of each in-game day traveling and looking for food and water. Eventually, you can build things to generate and store water, but it's a slog to get there. There doesn't seem to be a great way to store food; meat expires quickly, even when cooked, so you can't stock up. Eventually you unlock jerky but it's crap. Mushrooms don't go bad but you have to eat a lot of them to fill up.

Combat is extremely frustrating. Most enemies are [i]extremely[/i] tanky; for example, expect to spend several minutes to kill one spider, and spiders are EVERYWHERE ALL OF THE TIME. You can't just 'kill all of the enemies in an area', because they seem to respawn as soon as you travel a short distance.

The game is full of maddening catch-22s. You need Gnat Fuzz to make a bow, but it's almost impossible to kill a gnat without a bow. You need Sunken Bones to make gear that lets you swim further and faster, but the only way to reach them is by swimming down a hole that's so deep that you'll drown right after gathering them. You can only make good weapons with the parts that you would get from minibosses that are practically impossible to kill without good weapons.

As with many games in this genre, the game mechanics are not explained well and it seems like you are expected to play with a wiki constantly open for reference... which slows down gameplay even more.

There are various stupid glitches with the enemies getting stuck, not animating, moving through the ground, or hovering off into the sky. There are also many synchronization issues in coop. Some of the items still have placeholder artwork taken from other items.

I was excited when we finally unlocked turrets - but they're shitty. They don't seem very accurate, they chew threw ammo very quickly, and they do piss for damage. Just another way that Obsidian gives us all the finger.

""Like, it had way more complex gearing, way more complex upgrading your gear, the combat was just generally more fun due to your weapons having profound advantages vs certain enemies based on type -- it was also quite fucking challenging i had to turn the damn difficulty down solo.

All the mods we added to valheim for quality of life are baseline in grounded. Hot deposit near chests built in. Blueprint (ghost) building before hand built in. Storage and inventory sort built in. Armor dummy hot swapping for loadouts built in. Map markers with custom icons and custom text built in. Hell you can even move anything around without emptying it out, like if you want to move a chest around you can just do it without having to empty it out and put it in another one. 

If we all did a playthrough together, i swear we'd have just as much if not more fun than we did playing valheim.""",1687542112,1687542112,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The bug attacks are what's wrong with this game there has to be a way to turn them off.
I bought this game because I love to build stuff but having a bug attack go on so long that you can't save your progress, makes you lose all the progress you made on that game session.
if you are in a multiplayer session nobody else can make a shared copy of that session.
I don't care about the bug invasion or the payback attacks I play so I can build that's it.

Creative mechanics, interesting story, and it doesn't feel like the game gives you everything just by looking at the map. The map does give you the location of some important things, but there's always something needed before going there. You can't just walk in like you own the place, basically. The game keeps the progression slow, but it never necessarily stops in its tracks. (Minor spoiler) Some people act like the bugs you encounter in the late game are basically the shrunken equivalent of jaws, but the game keeps everything easy enough on the easy and regular mode. There's many setting that could help, and YES, there's and option to get rid of nasty motion blur. If you feel like playing the game differently, you can just set up a custom world and give yourself your own limits. Do remember that this is going to make your STEAM achievements get pissed off. Basically, the game is great. If the community mashes in your face that a weapon is too powerful or too weak, just remember that the people screaming about it probably play on the most difficult mode all the time and hate themselves. Also, every second you don't buy this, that's one more reason in your life to delete steam and get a job. :)",1687356456,1687356456,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I love this feature so much, because the main reason I like to play any games is to reduce my anxiety, and this facilitates that very well.

Pros: easy to learn gameplay, intuitive base building, great detail on bugs (and arachnids), great story-line, smol

Cons: lack of advanced movement/combat, no real need for proper base construction, lack of tamed bugs, and a hefty price tag

( it might just be me, but being able to stand on a ladybug, and being able to tame an aphid, shows that the devs can add more tame-ables, but I digress)
