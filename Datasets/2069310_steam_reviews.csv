1.  I was immediately disappointed with the graphics being very blurry except for a small focused area just fitting the helicopter within  about 50 feet of the flying position.  This made it very difficult to practice.
2.  When used in VR, the blurriness got even worse, and it developed the jitters.  My computer has a  Ryzen 7 5800 DX3 CPU; a 3090 graphics card, and 32 GBt of DRAM.  It is no slouch, and should run the Simulator with ease.  I have tweaked the settings repeatedly, and can not get it to look any better.
3rd.  The Instructor section is a joke.  The demonstration flights have the helicopter obscured in smoke most of the time, and the verbage the instructor uses is no help at all.  They repeatedly say if you know the basics, you should be able to master the maneuvers quickly.  He Doesn't lay out the steps up to the maneuvers or how to do them.  
A complete waste of time.
A total waste of money.
I bought the HELI-X sim to practice my helicopter flying  in VR instead.  Much, much better.

Editing my review now with the latest update (November 2023) which includes DX11 support:

Thank you for finally adding a borderless window mode. Baffling how this game only just added support for this in 2023 but a welcome addition nonetheless. Also strange that full screen mode was removed, but I would prefer borderless window mode so it's fine.

Unfortunately, the game is STILL INCORRECTLY AFFECTED BY WINDOWS SCALING.
This is very evident if you look at the edge of any aircraft. You will notice it is jaggy and pixelated, as if it's being rendered at a much lower resolution. However, if you disable windows scaling, the edge of the aircraft is extremely smooth. Something is messed up in the graphics engine that changes the way pixels are rendered when scaling is turned on. This REALLY needs to be fixed.

Regarding the rest of the game content:

The training modes all appear to be built only for Mode 2, so if you want to brush up on Mode 1, you can't. Even the on-screen transmitter visual is locked to Mode 2.

Text appears at the top of the screen every game launch asking you to press escape to open the menu and it never goes away until you actually press escape. If you're not near the keyboard (eg. gaming from the couch on a TV) this is entirely annoying. It should disappear after 30 seconds.

The main way of selecting an aircraft (Menu > Free Play > Aircraft) should really let you select a category of aircraft first (Helicopter, Plane or Quad) and then show a list of only those aircraft, rather than a super long list of everything mixed in together. I only discovered that there's a secondary menu if you move your mouse to the left edge of the screen some hours after using it.

The game/simulator does not change to a new sound device if you change the sound device in Windows after opening the game, and there isn't any way to change the sound device in the menu. It requires a game restart.

Amazingly, half the flying fields are low-resolution, pixelated, panoramic photos that would have looked right at home in 2008 and remove any immersion that could have been evoked. I'm confident I could take a higher quality panorama myself. Maybe I will. Not sure if it's supported. Even the 3D maps I've tried so far look really plain.

Given the above, do you think any form of anti-aliasing is supported in game to get rid of jagged edges on the edges of aircraft? Ha. Not a chance.

I literally can crash the simulator, reproducibly, by simply pressing the TAB key on my keyboard while RealFlight is opened. (EDIT: need to test if it still does this in the latest version).

The DirectX 11 update is a step in the right direction, but this game/simulator is seriously lagging behind in graphics support, user experience, models and flying fields.

I'm honestly underwhelmed and disappointed, especially for the high price of this software.",1698972412,1700419668,False,8,0,0.618826031684875488,0,True,False,False

Then imagine that you have the great idea to purchase a software company related to your industry. Then imagine being just as incompetent with managing that software company. 

You have arrived at RealFlight Evolution. GreatPlanes and realflight etc used to be fantastic. Whatever has occurred since then indicates that the people involved at horizon are unworthy of recognition as humans, as their IQ is clearly below that of most primates.

Whatever they have done is an embarrassment. The huge insult is that they not only provide a non working (issues with AMD cards) software, but while AAA games average from 20-60 dollars, these idiots think that 100 bucks is reasonable. Battlebit was a couple of developers and they sold their game (AND INCLUDE THE SERVER AND HOSTING INFRASTRUCTURE) for 15 bucks. Other drone simulators of varying quality are FREE or sub 20 bucks.       Then we arrive here. These worthless morons are charging more than double the industry norm price for a game that DOESNT EVEN WORK on a lot of machines. EVEN if it does work, there are zero improvements in graphics, physics, or interface, from OVER A DECADE AGO. 

I suspect you will be able to get it to run on an Nvidia machine, but only half the errors, hangs and crashes I am seeing are related to AMD. I would be nauseatingly embarrassed to be these people. With companies like this, its no wonder the entire RC flying world has devolved into rich idiot boomers, and foam chinese electric pieces of garbage.

I long for the days when you could order a reasonably priced kit, build it to high quality standards, bolt on an OS engine, and go fly noisily, and have decent simulators to build skill foundations. Now, instead, you over pay for cheap garbage that doesnt even work.

NEVERMIND ON THE AMD STUFF
I installed on a 3080ti machine and i couldnt even get the menu to come up. 
I spent 45 minutes of ""play time"" just trying to get basic things to work.
Combination of morons at MicroSoft(peen) making controller inputs stupid, and RealFlight (Horizon) being so incompetent that you cant easily select inputs, channels, program, access menus, setup. Nothing.     At least it didnt crash on start on Nvidia.


I recommend that instead of outsourcing to some idiot company overseas, maybe hire some actual developers in the US and pay them properly, lower your price to something that actually makes sense, and make good on what you have destroyed. And heres a tip... the future is open source.

Well, I recently got back into it and decided I should upgrade to the latest and greatest RealFlight in hopes that many of the issues I had with the old one would be fixed.  Long story short, they weren't.  In fact, the new game doesn't include many of the desirable options that are found in 3.5.  I included a list of some of the problems I have with RealFlight Ultimate.

1. The vehicle physics are more realistic.  However, that is like driving a car down a gravel road is a smooth ride.  If you have no other frame of reference, then it is good.  However, if you compare the physics to any actual airplane or helicopter, it feels fake.  Maneuvers are not realistic and you can't help but be reminded how you're in a game.
2. The training options have actually gotten worse since RealFlight 3.5  How is it possible that over a decade later, Horizon Hobbies cannot bring themselves to add a heli hover trainer?  This is simple and yet they refuse to add it.
3. If you want to fly Horizon Hobby models, then this is a reasonable flight sim.  But there are other airplane and heli manufacturers out there.  But hey, who cares, right?
4. How is it possible that the setup for a Spektrum radio isn't nearly instantaneous?  Why do I have to mess around with various switch combinations just to get basic controls to work?  And if you want anything beyond the basics, good luck.  
5. The graphics in this game have not been optimized at all.  This is especially amazing considering how horrible the aircraft and scenery look.  Even with all the settings cranked up, the picture is grainy and often distorted.  Not something you want in a flight sim.
6. The interface is not intuitive and requires you to sift through a variety of menus in order to find basic options.

I really can't believe how little progress has been made from RealFlight 3.5 to Realflight Evolution.  This was an utter waste of my money and I STRONGLY RECOMMEND YOU DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, especially if you fly helicopters.

This is not a game.  It is a simulator to learn how to fly RC planes.  You crash them 100 times in the simulator so you ideally never crash them in rel life because they will break in real life.  The physics aren't perfect and the plane profiles aren't an exact match to real life (the ultrix has differential thrust in real life but it doesn't in the simulator), but this will help you learn the muscle memory of how to maneuver the plane and it is pretty cool how you can get a feel for the exact plane you're planning to buy.

-great trainer that will train your muscle memory for those OH CRAP! moments at the field
-price of this simulator is cheaper than a lost/destroyed plane at the field!
-Physics feel real! Gain confidence flying by adjusting the weather variables so you know how a plane reacts

Negatives
-product hasn't changed in years since I first got it as RealFlight 7!
-price is high and a barrier to entry if you don't know its worth - see pros
-CRASHES! -program not the planes
-developers have NOT kept up with current programming Directx9 issues

PROGRAM CRASHES - AMD USERS READ!
AMD GPU users use the Betas > dxvk -intel -fix
I know it says INTEL and I know they meant it for iGPU's but IT WORKS!
Left click on the program in your library
Properties > Betas > dxvk -intel -fix
This fixed ALL of my startup crashes as well as missing textures in game and I have not had one crash since using this beta.

It has support for VR but in reality its awful as Dx9 was not made for VR and it won't matter if you have 6Ghz CPU and an RTX 4090 it is simply awful.

I spend more time trying to get this software to run, than actually using it.  It either crashes constantly, or gives you frozen screens, or gives you white screens, or becomes unresponsive.  This software is HORRIBLE!

The only reason I chose RF Evolution over AeroFly RC, is because I picked up a Spektrum InterLink DX controller and I knew this application should work really well with it.  Not to mention, the newest version AeroFly RC is not available on here at the time of writing this and I did not want to pay for the older version.

That said, if I had any other controller, I would without a doubt have went with AeroFly RC.  In my brief time with RealFlight, I have had numerous crashes.  Fullscreen had me stuck on the loading page with a froze screen for half an hour until I managed to knock it back to Windowed Mode (yea, I am having a lot of issues with Fullscreen).  The menu's are pretty clunky.  The organization for finding models is not very good and the filter is missing lots of elements.

So about a half hour of using RealFlight and I had a migraine and was regretting it pretty hard.  Their developers are the type of...

- I'm 80 years old and cannot program in any newer languages
- Computers stopped advancing in the 90's
- It works good enough
- Fix it?  It works for me.  Not fixing it
- As long as I know where things are, no one else needs to
- I am only a contractor, my time is up, this is what you get

...kind of people.  Shame on the company for putting out this kind of software.  Save yourself some frustration if you can.  Get AeroFly RC.  I have not used it, but I refuse to believe it is worse.

And to RealFlight (company and developers).  How about you fix your software?  At this price point, there is no reason for a crashing, buggy, clunky piece of software.

Also  stay on top of your flying skills in the winter months,  if your someplace where summer is very hot this is also the tool.  Horizon got RealFlight when they took over Tower.  Before this they had Phoenix Flight sim which was better in almost every way.

Pro's
1. Good tool to learn R.C. flying  
2. Helps keep your flying skills moving upwards.
3. V.R. support
4. Many types of Aircraft to try out and fly something you would never try other wise.

Con's
1. RealFlight will come out with a new RealFlight almost every two years instead of improving Evolution.
2. V.R. needs a lot of work.
3. Graphics ( Graphics are 7 to 8 years behind) There wars a time when systems could not run more than what you get with RealFlight but that time has long passed.

Now My Personal Con's
I've been flying R.C. Aircraft since 1974.

I fly very large Warbirds both fix wing and Helicopters. None of which are covered in RealFlight.
I fly V.R. and RealFlight  needs a lot work here.
Graphics need a major upgrade.

It's still good to have!! IMHO

HorizonHobby, Eflite, HobbyZone, ParkZone, etc. Ive flown a few models. that i have, for alittle bit so far and its very realistic. Each plane fly's so differently espcially the faster jets, etc

For anyone without Real Flight 9.5, I would definitely recommend getting this. It allows you to practice to basically as close to real as possible, and lets you try out faster or harder maneuvers. Then when you crash you can just hit the Reset button lol.

I use the game with my Spektrum DX6 Transmitter sometimes, but mostly with an extra DXS. Plus the Spektrum DSMX USB Dongle to make it all wireless. That way its extremely similiar to flying with my DX6 Transmitter, whcih is my main TX right now for the plane's. 
I also like that the game can play on my regular laptop no problem. So i can use it on the go without a gaming laptop. I mostly use it on my Desktop which has a GPU, but I can run max settings on the Laptop and keep 60fps easy. 
Though I would prefer a high resolution texture package option for those of us who have the PC to run some games. Even with modern APU's.

I know a lot would like the game to be graphics level of modern PC or Xbox games, especially to make VR mode more worth it, but just in general anyway, and for $100 it definitely should and could be a lot better pretty done... But i think to re-make the whole game and keep the great real flying using the realistic simulation setting might take a whole new game to be made but im not sure honestly.

Overall it gets about 4 stars. Needs to be the price of a console game. $60 and then I would give it 5 stars.

I could not get the menu to open at all.  After a week of messing with it, I finally found a thread on a forum that mentioned hitting ESC to get to the menu.  Well, that was news.  Now, I can find all the features I was expecting. I love the refined menus. I love that all the old keyboard shortcuts still apply. I know I shouldn't be greedy here, but... RealFlight, you really ought to make this simulator work with Linux. I had to swallow my pride and buy Windows so I could fly on my computer. This cost me another ~$115. The worst thing about this: Microsoft made more money off me (I really hate that.) We all know that Linux and Apple are superior.  So, just catch up already.

(edit: You can still get to the old-style menu's. First, make sure you are not at ""full screen."" Then, open the ""console gadget"" by typing the ""~"". You have to use the shift key and hit the key just left of the ""1"" on the top row. Finally, you can type ""showlegacymenu"" and press enter. Press the ""~"" again to exit the console. To get rid of the legacy menu, repeat the whole process, or simply go into full screen mode.)

Pros:
1) Best flight sim I have ever used
2) Physics can be slowed down to learn challenging maneuvers
3) With the WS2000 Spektrum Dongle I can fly with any DSM2/DSMX transmitter, like my new NX8
4) With STEAM behind the scenes, no more need for managing anti-pirating features that require users to occasionally find or type long keys
5) The new menus are beautiful and work well
6) There are many ACTUAL transmitters to choose from. If you are using one of these transmitters, setup is simple!
7) Aircraft are up with the times. There are a number of aircraft to fly that you, then, can go to the store and buy. I really love this. Not perfect, but gives you a chance to try it before you buy it. If you already have the aircraft, you can do those really daring things with it from the safety of the simulator and risk nothing at the field.

Cons:
1) First time pilots could make a few mistakes that will cost them big money:
     - Allowing RealFlight to constantly stay zoomed in on the aircraft. Aircraft get so far away at the field you cannot see them there either. Don't get that far away. Learn how to recover by only seeing the direction the aircraft is moving. Everyone needs this skill!
     - Simulator aircraft fly EXACTLY as they are intended to, real aircraft do not. Get used to flying with bad trim, low power, too much power, etc.
     - Weather in the sim is perfect. Be sure to practice in the sim with bad weather too, especially crosswinds on approach.
2) Does not work with Linux and Mac

A lot of negative reviews based on its price considering its similarity vs previous generations of RealFlight. These are probably justified. I would not have bought this if I owned anything in the past few generations.


There's a few issues but they can be fixed or ignored.

- Game looks very similar to older versions. Expect graphics that feel 10+ years old, but that's not what you buy it for. This is here to save you some money on broken models and let you practice in the off season. If you really want, go into your video card setting and force on FXAA and other anti-aliasing settings. This does help a bit, especially when the aircraft is far away.

- [b]Use the legacy menu[/b], the new menu sucks, its barely passable if you want to navigate via the controller. However if you happen to have a mouse and keyboard in front of you do yourself a favour and exit full screen (alt+enter) then type ""showlegacymenu"" in the console. The old menu is way faster to navigate and has more menu choices available. They missed adding things like heli hover training tool in the new menu. Stupid.

- Simulation quality is great. Feels correct. Models that come with the game fly like they do in real life. If you find otherwise you can freely adjust them in the editor. You can even change CoG, battery size, prop size etc., and it all effects the simulation how you would expect. Really neat to try different props and battery sizes out before buying them.

- Game runs on a potato, my old 2011 laptop with integrated graphics runs this over 100 FPS at 1080p. Obviously this game isn't marketed towards gamers who have the latest (or any discrete) video card. Lots of hobbyists just want to run this on whatever computer they happen to own.

- Controller support. I haven't run into any issues, my RC transmitter (Taranis X9D Plus with XSR-SIM dongle) works just fine, as do any of my console Bluetooth controllers. Be sure to create a model in the transmitter for Windows! It still needs to output to a channel. Windows is unable to see the stick/switch positions unless you link them to a channel.

- As a training tool this is fantastic. Between the lessons and challenges I've already become a much better pilot in just a few days. Imagine being able to get multiple flying hours in daily without risking a plane. Seat time really helps with orientation. 

- Some content is locked behind challenges. Interesting choice as some of the challenges are EXTREMELY difficult. I probably wont be able to complete them all without hundreds of hours of experience. Luckily the content that's locked isn't really missed (novelty planes/additional flying sites).

- Resolution issues, I haven't had any. I run this on a 3440x1440 ultrawide on my desktop, a 1920x1080 laptop, and GameStream to a 4K TV via Nvidia Shield. I have not tried VR. The ultrawide provides the best experience due to the aspect ratio.

-Some people are reporting misc errors (loading failures/crashes/etc.), I haven't run across any yet. Thus far its been very stable on my two machines.

Esc button doesnt work. redownloaded the game and its  doing the same thing. this game is not cheap and for it not to work is crazy to me. I payed 100 dollars for a game I can not play. I was really looking forward to playing this game. Big disapointment.  Maybe the developers will come up with a patch to fix this problems. It says time played was 2 hours but that time was spent trying to get the menu up, and trouble shout to see what was wrong. They need to change the timer to actual time played not how long the game has been running . Check out my last post and watch the video. How to set NVIDIA as Default Graphics Card on windows 10.

If you do own 9.5/s, I would not recommend upgrading yet.  The ability to quickly change Aircraft, is well... gone, or buried somewhere I can't find.   I did receive this free as I just recently bought the 9.5S.   The Physics are ""OK"" and the graphics are decent.  Some of the fields have very unusual collision boxes for some of the terrain. The trees on some fields are difficult to tell distances.  Overall, it is a good tool to help with orientation, and practices.  For touch and goes, the simulation is WAY too forgiving, and I wish there were settings to make it more realistic.  All in all, I would say the differences between 9.5s and this are negative UI, positive on the new planes.

I first played Real Flight over 10 years ago.  It was great for learning to fly RC planes in a safe environment where a crash doesn't have steep consequences.  It still is.

However, this version of Real Flight is just like any of its predecessors.  There is very little advantage to upgrade from any of the last 4 versions. I can't bring myself to recommend any of my friends to upgrade.  It's the same piece of software it was 10 years ago.

If you're new to RC planes, go for it; you'll have a safe places to learn in. If you're getting into multi-copters or FPV, there are better and cheaper alternatives.",1666986751,1666986751,False,55,1,0.819121778011322021,2,True,True,False
