The amount of detail put in Story is amazing, better than any game made in 2018 or maybe even today. But Online is a different story. It is a complete piece of garbage. Rockstar doesn't care whatsoever. There have been 0 new updates that actually bring something new to the game for around a year. Online is a simple cash grab. It was never meant to last as an actual game to be fun; all Rockstar cares about is money. If you are contemplating about buying Red Dead Online standalone after buying GTA, do not. This game is £20, which could be spent on something actually useful. You cannot own properties; you can own around 2 actual businesses, and only one of them has a building (barely customisable). The game crashes randomly for no reason. The Online mode is unplayable in its current state. Rockstar doesn't give a **** about it. They haven't bothered to fix it. The only reason Red Dead Online is still running is because Rockstar is selling Gold Bars. As soon as people stop buying Gold Bars, this game will shut down. I'm very sad to see what it could have been and what it is right now. RDRO should be put in a Beta state; you cannot release a game like this. You could have increased the map size, added Mexico, and made it so you could buy houses and shops. It could have been infinitely better. This isn't even a fraction of what it could have been. All Rockstar does is add 1 limited clothing item every month and call it a day. They add bonuses every month, but this month, it didn't even work for the first few days. Can you believe that? All they do is click a button to add double pay for a single role, but they couldn't even do that?! This is a terrible look for Rockstar. Something has to happen with this game because this won't be a good look for GTA 6 Online, either. But who cares, every online made by Rockstar is a simple cash grab. Here is the part I don't understand. Rockstar wants money, so if RDRO were updated, that would surely bring more players and make you more money. The fact that this game won Labour of Love amazes me. The fact that this game won any award whatsoever is crazy. Sorry for my little rant. Rockstar is clearly behaving like Dutch at this point.

Red Dead Redemption 2 isn't just a game; it's an immersive journey into the heart of the American Wild West, a meticulously crafted masterpiece that sets a new standard for open-world gaming experiences. From its breathtaking landscapes to its deeply engaging narrative, every aspect of this game is a testament to Rockstar Games' unparalleled dedication to their craft.

Let's start with the world itself. The sheer scale and detail of the world Rockstar has created are nothing short of astounding. From the snow-capped mountains of the Grizzlies to the swamps of Lemoyne, every inch of the map feels alive and teeming with activity. Whether you're riding through the heartland of New Hanover or navigating the bustling streets of Saint Denis, there's always something new and exciting to discover.

But what truly sets Red Dead Redemption 2 apart is its storytelling. At its core, this is a tale of redemption, loyalty, and the struggle to survive in a rapidly changing world. The game puts you in the boots of Arthur Morgan, a rugged outlaw and member of the Van der Linde gang, as he grapples with his own morality and the looming specter of his past. As you journey across the American frontier, you'll encounter a colorful cast of characters, each with their own hopes, dreams, and demons to confront.

The writing in Red Dead Redemption 2 is nothing short of phenomenal. Every conversation, every mission, every random encounter feels like it was lifted straight from the pages of a classic Western novel. The dialogue crackles with authenticity, drawing you deeper into the world and the lives of its inhabitants. And the performances from the voice cast, particularly Roger Clark as Arthur Morgan, are simply breathtaking, bringing each character to life in vivid detail.

Of course, a great story is nothing without great gameplay to back it up, and Red Dead Redemption 2 delivers in spades. Whether you're engaging in intense shootouts with rival gangs, hunting legendary animals in the wilderness, or simply sitting around the campfire swapping stories with your fellow outlaws, every moment feels like a natural extension of the world and the characters that inhabit it.

And then there's the attention to detail. From the way Arthur's beard grows over time to the realistic physics of horseback riding, every aspect of Red Dead Redemption 2 has been painstakingly crafted to create the most immersive experience possible. The level of realism is staggering, making you feel like you've truly stepped back in time to the dying days of the Wild West.

But perhaps what is most impressive about Red Dead Redemption 2 is its ability to evoke a wide range of emotions. One moment you'll find yourself laughing at the antics of your fellow gang members, and the next you'll be on the edge of your seat as you race against the clock to pull off a daring heist. And then there are the quieter moments, the moments of reflection and introspection, where you'll find yourself pondering the nature of morality and the choices we make in life.

In conclusion, Red Dead Redemption 2 is not just a game; it's a work of art. It's a testament to the power of storytelling in video games, and a shining example of what can be achieved when a team of talented developers pour their hearts and souls into their craft. If you're a fan of open-world games, Westerns, or just great storytelling in general, do yourself a favor and saddle up for the ride of a lifetime with Red Dead Redemption 2. You won't regret it.

It's as if it was somehow more realistic and enjoyable to conclude the story in which the protagonist ends up dead for whatever reason and it just plainly sucks in my opinion. 

Otherwise a fantastic game gets ruined by a unnecessary dramatic finale for the character and leaves a sour taste on mouth as if real world consequences were so fun why would we engage into escapism in the video games in the first place. Maybe the justification for making such story is that ""times were changing"", ""Arthur was a bad man running out of time"", or ""Tuberculosis claimed good and bad alike those days""... or something along the line but honestly I'm personally sick and tired of having all the interesting characters get killed for no merit to the actual story except ""well, the story has to end sometime"", it doesn't mean the character would live forever if they had a happy ending but rather I honestly would personally rather see good endings to good stories instead of this ""world is murky pond of eventuality that everyone has to face one day"". 

I doubt anyone thinks such endings are deep or meaningful as it's literally happening to everyone eventually and it isn't even pleasing as the character we've cherished and enjoyed following the exploits, developments, interactions with characters and etc. suddenly kicks the bucket and we are just left with the naive ending of ""and then they died, end of story"".
It's pathetic way to end a story of otherwise good character in a good story with such enjoyable vistas and other details with thousands of hours behind and for this reason I will not recommend this game for anyone.",1708846482,1708846482,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

If you haven't yet played it, and you enjoy an immersive open world, do yourself a favor and play it. If you appreciate slower paced open world RPGs like Fallout, you will love Red Dead 2.

The attention to detail is second to none. Carrying bodies leaves blood on your shoulder. Coyotes chase after rabbits. Every NPC interacts with the environment, whether it's hammering nails, or doing farm work, or chatting with each other. You can greet every rider you pass, or insult them and pick a fight. The world feels truly alive in a way that I've never experienced in another game.

RDR2 isn't perfect. It's very slow paced at times. When you skin an animal, it takes 5-10 seconds, which I know is aggravating for some players. The controls can feel clunky, both on and off your horse—although the animations are excellent, and the game does the very best it can to make all of your movements and your horse's movements look totally natural.

 It has a number of mechanics that can feel half-done at times, but the silver lining is that you only have to engage in these features if you want to. If you never clean your gun, you probably won't notice any difference. It doesn't matter that much if you eat regularly, or keep your horse brushed, or if you contribute food and money to the gang's camp. But you can do all of these things, and the game does reward you, if only a little.

The story is very good, if occasionally feeling padded by a handful of detours to make the length of the game appropriate. The voice acting is top-notch, and it's matched by great animation in and out of cutscenes.

There is also just SO much content, and this is coming from someone who hasn't touched the Online stuff. There's dozens of side missions and activities, random interactions, and points of interest to find. I'm on like my 4th playthrough with 500+ hours and I'm still finding things I've never come across before. I can just get lost in this game like no other. I load the game up with the intention of hunting down a particular animal for the compendium, or completing a certain mission, and then save and quit an hour later and realize I did nothing but wander. 

There's a reason Rockstar games are 2 or 3 times a decade—it's worth the wait. I can't recommend Red Dead Redemption 2 enough. It's just a masterpiece in every sense of the word.",1708841212,1708841212,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A full play through will take well over 100 hours if you do some side missions, and several hundred if you do all the side missions. 

Keep in mind the problems some people have described below.

Game is amazing - when it works! Best graphics and script that stands up to games even in 2023... HOWEVER - support is bad and the anti theft protections literally make it unplayable now. I bough the game a few years ago, played it, but now can't log in because the 'launcher' won't authenticate me for some reason - even though I can log into rockstars website - and they won't let you play the offline campaign without authenticating with the launcher... so $60 game that can't actually be played.",1704577817,1708840543,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, this story absolutely blew my mind away. The characters are incredibly engaging and relatable. Each person in the story added an element and personality to an entertaining gang of early 20th century wild west buccaneers. Although there is a very obvious main antagonist, the writing is done so well that it makes him seem like much more than a driving force of selfish and narcissistic goals. In the end its great characters that create an unforgettable story. 

The overall gameplay mechanics are really enjoyable, and I liked that I had the option of progressing through the game at my own pace. The amount of freedom it gives you is great way of achieving this. The reputation system implements an awesome feedback loop that allows the players' decisions to feel like actual meaningful decisions. On top of this, the graphics are so hyper-realistic, and every object in the game is rendered so well. I really enjoyed this aesthetic choice because it created an environment that made the characters feel more real and emotionally connected.

[h1]RDR2[/h1]
Regarding the RDR2 base game, as in, the Story Mode, nothing has changed and it's still a great game that is on its own enough reason to pay the full price tag. The story is very compelling and generally extremely polished, as befits Rockstar's fame for making amazing singleplayer experiences. The world is immersive and very detailed, and is certainly one of the game's greatest highlights. It's also fairly lengthy, with a narrative that may take around 60 hours to complete and does not get boring at all.

[strike]There has also been talk of a RDR remake recently, as some trademarking documents have come up, so we have that to look forward to. If it's real, of course.[/strike] Nevermind it was a fucking Switch port :skull:

[h1]RDO[/h1]
The meat of this review, however, is RDO. It's no exaggeration to call it a dead game. Rockstar is also famous for its horrific work on GTAO, and RDO just takes it to the next level. While GTAO is often complained about because of things like being too grindy, and the fact that the prices for newer content are unbalanced when compared to the original set of content due to a lack of future planning; RDO just cranks it to 11. Instead of hearing the community and making the game less grindy, they simply made [b]everything[/b] expensive. However, you soon come to the realization that there isn't really anything to sink your money into to begin with.

The main problem here is the [b]lack of content[/b]. Rockstar has officially, as of 2021, abandoned RDO. The game no longer receives major content updates and lots of bugs that have been known about for a long time, like the Blackwater Stable glitch, are still in the game. You can grind mindlessly for about a month to get yourself the basics, like good weapons, a good horse, some bling, etc... only to come to the realization that [b]that's it[/b]. You literally have nothing else left to do. The story is super short, if you're generous enough to say it actually exists; the roles are extremely repetitive and boring, and so are any sort of missions like the Blood Money and Telegram content.

This is all made even worse by the unfixed, progress breaking glitches, and the overwhelming amount of cheaters that plague the game.

In a nutshell, RDO has the amazing base that RDR2 is, and it certainly uses its world, but it doesn't do a good job of being fun, neither does Rockstar care to ever change that in the future.

This game is so incredibly detailed you can wander off in the woods and find something new and cool. There are so many different interactions you can have, and the immersion is so good. The characters and incredibly well written, and the gameplay is so much fum.

However, the game isn't perfect. Some sections of the game are tedious, badly designed, and a lot of features do basically nothing. The horse movement is not the greatest at times, and your own movement isn't the greatest sometimes. This game is, in my opinion, something you enjoy most if you slow down and just look at everything. Racing through this game will mean you miss 90% of cool stuff this game has to offer. Definitely recommend playing this game if you haven't, or go for another play-through if you have.

Hosea, Dutch, and Arthur
A young Arthur (right) with Hosea Matthews and Dutch van der Linde.

Arthur Morgan was born circa 1863[1] to Beatrice and Lyle Morgan in the northern United States.[2] As a child, his mother died of unknown causes, while his father was a petty criminal and outlaw. In 1874, when Arthur was 11 years old, his father was arrested for larceny. Morgan later witnessed his death and, despite a strained relationship with him, still donned his hat and kept a picture of him.[3][4]

Around 1877, Arthur was found as a 'wild delinquent' and picked up off the streets by Dutch van der Linde and Hosea Matthews.[5] Viewing the pair as surrogate father figures, Arthur came to share Dutch's vision of a life lived free from the constraints of civilization and the rule of law. The pair taught him how to read, write, hunt, fight, shoot, and ride, becoming their first protégé as well as one of the founding members of the Van der Linde gang.

Arthur found a pet dog named Copper at some point whom he grew particularly close to and occasionally took baths with. Although Arthur had difficulty controlling him, he admired the dog's spirit. Copper later passed away and Arthur kept a picture of him on his wagon. He also later acquired a mare named Boadicea whom he became fond of and she became his signature mount.

As a young adult, Arthur met a girl named Mary Gillis where the two fell deeply in love and even became engaged. He befriended her younger brother Jamie and taught him horseback-riding. However, Arthur's preference for a life of crime coupled with the prevalent disapproval of Mary's family, most strongly from her father ultimately caused their relationship to fall apart and the pair separated.

In 1884, Arthur was sent out fishing and pridefully returned with three beautiful bass. The gang celebrated with a big feast and toasted him all night long. The following week, Arthur and Dutch walked in the local market where it was revealed that he had simply purchased the bass from a fish monger, much to his embarrassment.[6]

In 1885, Arthur met a 12 year-old boy named John Marston who had been saved by Dutch from being lynched by a group of Illinois homesteaders. John was inducted into the gang and raised alongside Arthur with the pair growing as close as brothers. Dutch instilled the boys with his anarchist worldviews against a corrupt government and preached that revenge was a fool's game. Over the years, Arthur and John became regarded as Dutch's favorite 'sons'.

In 1887, Arthur participated in the gang's first major bank robbery alongside Dutch and Hosea. At 2 o'clock, the trio burst into the banking house of Lee and Hoyt and managed to make off with $5000 in gold. After the robbery, they lingered in town, going to hovels, shanties, and orphanages handing out money, envisioning themselves as 'Robin Hood' figures.[7] It was following this event where Arthur became a wanted man.

Some years later, Arthur met and slept with a 19 year-old waitress named Eliza, resulting in her becoming pregnant with their son, Isaac. Although Eliza knew of Arthur's lifestyle, she accepted whatever support he offered to her and their son. Arthur, not wanting to promise anything he couldn't keep, said that he would do right by them. He would periodically visit Eliza and Isaac every few months and stay with them for days at a time. Arthur remembered fondly of Isaac as a 'good kid'.

Tragically one day, however, Arthur arrived at their home and saw two crosses outside. He knew immediately that they were both dead, and later learned that they had been shot and killed by robbers, all for ten dollars.[8] This traumatic incident hardened Arthur as a result as he never truly coped with the pain and gave him the understanding to not live the life of an outlaw and expect good things to happen to him.

In 1894, a prostitute named Abigail Roberts joined the Van der Linde Gang. At some point, she fell in love with John Marston and became pregnant with their son named Jack. Arthur became a surrogate uncle figure towards him growing up. John however refused to accept responsibility over the boy and soon left the gang. Around a year later, John returned, while Dutch and the majority of the gang welcomed him back with open arms, Arthur felt betrayed by his actions and a rift was formed between the two which steadily grew over the years.

By 1898, the gang had found itself in Montana. During their stay, Hosea caught several large salmon during a fishing trip and planned to prepare a feast for the whole camp. However, the feast was cut short when Copper found and ate the fish, passing away soon after.[9] After a fire, in which Arthur's old journal was lost, and some trouble up north, the gang traveled south and east, taking a slow and tortuous trail down through the Northern Grizzlies to throw off anyone tracking them. They then spent several months in the wilderness. During the winter, they stuck mostly to the western foothills of the mountain.

While traversing the Grizzlies, several new members were picked up and brought into the gang. A young teenager, Lenny Summers, and a drifting outlaw, Charles Smith. Arthur had generally fair opinions of the pair, eventually forming close bonds with the two. Later on, the gang came across Jenny Kirk, a young woman abandoned by the roadside. The most recent member inducted into the gang was Micah Bell, a hot-headed career outlaw who saved Dutch's life in a shootout. Although Dutch found a liking to Micah, Arthur openly disliked him for his tendencies.

By the spring of 1899, the gang had arrived in West Elizabeth and decided to hide in plain sight just outside Blackwater, a town undergoing the process of industrialization. The gang began to scope out many leads, including Arthur and Hosea, who were planning a hefty real estate scam. Despite this, Dutch was also planning something big. Supported by Micah, Dutch began working on plans to rob a ferry laden with riches coming to town. Hosea and Arthur were reluctant despite Dutch's beliefs. His plan was to carry out the heist then flee west, possibly into New Austin. Then, after Arthur and Hosea carried out their scam, they would join the gang the following day.

Unfortunately, the ferry heist did not go as expected. At some point during the robbery, the gang was ambushed by the Pinkertons, causing a massive firefight known as the Blackwater Massacre. Arthur and Hosea arrived late, and by then, the gang was barely holding on.[10] Several gang members were killed or seriously injured, and they fled the area in an ""almighty scramble,"" north into the mountains in hopes of avoiding the law. Arthur suspected that the heist might have been a set up.",1708708009,1708708241,True,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

This is because I love its open world and how it is built, a spectacular Wild West brought to light by the developers, where losing yourself just exploring nature is a real pleasure. 

Story, characters, side activities and gameplay are solid as always when you consider this is a Rockstar game, even if their strict and cinematic bound mission structure could be innovated a bit. The real gem is the main character, Arthur Morgan, probably my favorite videogame protagonist of all time. 

Technically everything is high tier, light simulation and music score on top of all. Character models maybe are not up to today's standards anymore, as this is a 2018/19 game, but everything else shines for attention to detail and simulation realism.

Rockstar Games continues to exceed expectations every time they release a game. Many memorable characters and moments that prove how thought out the writing is. The main story includes 100+ missions. This is a top tier open world game that doesn't cut corners and really focuses on realism and the smallest of details. A goofy example of this is how your horses balls will actually shrivel up if it's in a cold environment. There's also a lot of really cool easter eggs and side missions that carry a completely different tone which helps shake things up and makes a lot of them a must see. It should be noted that at any time you can take a break from being a cowboy and take on the role of a hunter, fisherman, bounty hunter, gambler, plus more. Games like these will remind you that there are still passionate developers out there. That's why there are only a few games of this caliber every decade.

The game takes you away to the frontier and stalks you, and the people you learn to care about, as that frontier is slowly chipped away. The story and immersion of the game are its greatest strengths. However, that immersion comes at the cost of many game mechanics when compared to modern titles. The gun-play is rudimentary, the map and quick travel are prehistoric, the inventory and equipment management is clunky as !@$@. Sounds terrible? Well, that's the point. From the beautiful visuals, sounds, and survival elements you get a simple map, have to take the time to travel anywhere, hopefully on a horse, the guns simple for sure, and you feel like you're physically pulling out a can of baked beans to eat every time you open the inventory. Rock-star clearly created a game around the immersive nature of the game. At the price of your convenience, so enjoy. 

Achievement-wise the game is quiet systematic with a few miss-able achievements (bears!), for the most part you do need to be rather thorough, but as any achievement hunter will tell you this adds a whole new experience to the game as you find all those extra gems that Rockstar put in, their effort is on full display here and you will be grateful you took the time.

One of the most emotionally compelling stories ever written. Great character development for both main and side characters. If you want to fully experience the development of Arthur Morgan, playing the side quests is a must. The story fully describes the social and political development of America and its people at the end of the ""old west"" period.

The game world is as immersive as it gets. Side character dialogues and arguments, npc provocations and mugging attempts, animal attacks, treasure hunters observing the mountains and waterfalls, wild horses roaming the plains.... The most detailed enviroment I've ever seen in a game, corpses rot and get eaten by scavanging animals, your beard and hair grows, you need to dress apropriatly to the weather conditons, I could go on forever... Hunting and fishing are a big part of the game and the mechanics are made exceptionaly well with countless species of animals and fish that act in just like in nature.
Combat is very realistic, brutal and satisfying with a lot of weapon options. 

The story mode is very long and will easily take you 80+ hours on a playthrough if you want to fully experience it.

As for the online mode, I played it solo focusing on trader and bounty hunter roles, it was very fun but once you get a good horse, weapons and max out your role ranks there is really not much left to do and you have nothing to spend your money on. Playing roles is a huge grind but I enjoyed it a lot.  Also when you reach 80+ rank there is not much to do. Ranking up doesn't take very long if you grind the roles and take advantage of seasonal rockstar bonuses. For me it was great for 50h but I have nothing left to do in online, had a lot more potential. 

As for optimization the game runs very smoothly and looks beautiful. You need rockstar laucher to play it which is a bit annoying but never caused any problems for me.",1692400021,1708637767,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Arthur Morgan

===================================================================

What an absolute MASTERPIECE! This game is the result of good storytelling and good game mechanic combined. It doesn't matter if you haven't played the first RDR, because this is actually set before it as we're introduced to the Van der Linde gang in their ""glorious"" era, and the writing is magnificent. I dare say, Arthur Morgan is one of the most well-written video game characters of all time (so far). I love how Rockstar Games put a lot of effort to give details to the Game like if you hunt an animal but shoot at the body, the skin/pelt will have a lower quality because you ""ruined"" it. Also, trivial stuff like there's this bird species that can go extinct when you kill a certain number of them. They all make the Game more ""alive"".

When it comes to the game mechanic, RDR2 will give you an intuition to do some stuff out of curiosity (just like GTA), like trying to get on top of a train car while riding a horse or try to lasso our NPC friend when out of Camp area. This just proves that the game mechanic is so rich, that even if we can't do the stuff we're curious about it's still quite enough and satisfying. You have many types of gun to choose, you can hunt legendary animals, rob a stagecoach, and make a camp to cook or craft or sleep. The visual is so good that I couldn't help myself to take a screenshot or use photo mode in almost every corner of the RDR2 world. There's also an honor system (you can choose to be bad or good) that can actually affect how the people talk to you and even the outcome of some missions and cutscenes.

I, myself, am not actually a fan of Wild West theme.. But, boy oh boy, this Game sometimes made me want to do horse-riding and buy a revolver gun. I can't wait for GTA VI, the RDR remaster, or even better, RDR3 (here's hoping)!

In Red Dead Redemption, his fate is put to the test.

Through the hills and the valleys, we'll ride without fail.

With a hat pulled low and a Colt on his side,
Arthur rides with the gang, on this wild, lawless tide.
Dutch van der Linde, a leader so sly,
But in this game of survival, who'll live and who'll die?

(Chorus)
Hoist the sails, on this outlaw's trail,
Through the hills and the valleys, we'll ride without fail.
In the land of the free, where the outlaws roam,
Red Dead Redemption, we'll make this land our own.

(Verse 3)
Bounty hunters on our trail, under the western sun,
Facing danger and betrayal, one by one.
With the campfire's glow, and the stars overhead,
In the vast frontier, we'll face what lies ahead.

(Chorus)
Hoist the sails, on this outlaw's trail,
Through the hills and the valleys, we'll ride without fail.
In the land of the free, where the outlaws roam,
Red Dead Redemption, we'll make this land our own.

(Verse 4)
From the snowy peaks to the swamps so deep,
In the heart of the struggle, our secrets we keep.
Gunfights at dawn, and a poker face,
In this rugged land, we'll find our place.

(Chorus)
Hoist the sails, on this outlaw's trail,
Through the hills and the valleys, we'll ride without fail.
In the land of the free, where the outlaws roam,
Red Dead Redemption, we'll make this land our own.

(Outro)
As the credits roll, and the sun sets low,
In the echoes of the shanty, the wild tales will grow.
Red Dead Redemption, a story untold,
In the heart of the West, where the legends unfold.",1708622709,1708622709,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First, the pace of the game is really slow.  I had so much fun playing the first RDR, but this one struggles to find a pacing that keeps me engaged.  You spend a ton of time just riding around your horse across the open world doing nothing but traveling from one destination to the next.

The second issue, with which I've been back and forth with Rockstar support many times and without adequate resolution, is that the game has an always-online requirement, even for the single player story mode.  I've tried everything they've offered to me, but the game absolutely refuses to start in offline mode.  If you're hoping to go on an airplane or a vacation where you have limited internet access, don't look here.

It manages to do all the things survival games have been trying to do while making them interesting and not invasive. It gives players a real sense of playing their role through the honor system and the character skill progression by actions your character performs. And above all, in truest Rockstar fashion, it's one of the best stories in gaming, and Arthur Morgan quickly becomes an even more lovable character than I expected. RDR2's start is slow, measured, but as the layers begin to unfold and the scope of the game's sandbox is known, you see just how impressive it all really is. This is easily a top candidate for one of the greatest open world RPGs of all time.

The way it's world feels so... real has not been accomplished in any other game I have played, especially open world games. I care for the random strangers that exist in this game's world because the simulation of humanity is so vivid that it emotionally affects me in a way other games do not. I love this game so much. Let me make it clear that I do recommend this game to anyone who is interested in a slower-paced high production life-sim/open world action game. I have criticisms of this game, especially of the experience of playing through the main story compared to the incredible open world gameplay, but that's not the real problem with this game.

I can't play it offline because of the rockstar launcher requiring a constant internet connection to verify that you on your account are playing this game. ""always online"" DRM that no one likes, and no one wants except for stockholders who have ""heard"" that it cuts down on piracy so they force it on every AAA studio.
rockstar account is required, if you lose your Rockstar account from a hacker, or you somehow can't get back in, you just have to buy the game again! and if you wanted to family share this game, you cant : )
it's just overall an unstable PC port that stutters constantly and has notorious crashes unkown error go fffffff yourself still hasn't been fixed and Rockstar claims it's a problem with Bluetooth headphones which is just the most insane bullsh't but if true it really shows how f'cked this game is that it doesn't allow you to use bluetooth devices, in the year 2019, ok.
I get steam notifications about events but not anything actually happening in the online mode aside from hackers ruining it
This game updated and I accidentally selected ""No"" when it asked me if I want cloud saves and so my 86.92% complete save file is gone with no way of recovering it. I'd honestly play this game regardless of save file progression but like what the f'ck is that. You select no once and if you try to enable it again it's still gone. Nice.
this game is like skyrim, mods are required for it and therefore an ""illegitimate"" copy of this game that you could theoretically play offline, can't be modded (at least that's what most mod pages say) Great.
This is the only game I can think of that requires the ""killable children mod"" teenage kids will rob you in this game, or ask you to go find their dog that's lost only to abuse the dog when you return, these kids actually need to die and the fact they are in the game and you can't kill them after witnessing them harm humans and animals alike is genuinely evil and the developers/writers should feel bad for making these decisions.

This game doesn't deserve a negative review but Rockstar and Take Two interactive deserve one though. I love this game so much but I can't recommend it because of what these companies make you go through when you pay for it, the lack of support, the absolute disrespect they clearly have for their consumers the state of Red Dead Redemption 2 as a product you have to buy breaks my heart. This game has the curse of ManBearPig, it's actually one of the greatest things ever made but it comes with some monkey's paw sh't.",1706871165,1708603253,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I will be giving at my reviews on the one of the chapters from 1 - 6 and the epilogue

Chapter 1 - (6/10) this chapter is hella short but we did get to meet some characters, some where from red dead 1 which is cool to see, but its a short chapter.

Chapter 2 - (9.5/10) Chapter 2 was a vert great chapter to begin with, most missions are very great then some other missions, there is something that I like which is the camp site, thats the only thing I like, thats all for this.

Chapter 3 - (4/10) its fine but not a fan of it.

Chapter 4 - (7/10) I only like the big house, cuz I think I am a very rich man.

Chapter 5 - (4.5/10) Its short, just like chapter 1.

Chapter 6 - (3.5/10) Most of the missions are boring but the I do not want to talk about the final mission

Epilogue Part 1 And 2 - It's cool cuz you can play as John Marston, its like red dead 1 when you play as him, its very chill, my fav part about this game is that we're you can kill micah cuz he is a damn rat.

I would recomment this game to everyone just because of the story-mode, but you can havet quite a few fun-hours in the online-mode as well.

Now, 2 years later, I need to  revise my review. You can just play the story mode. The developers let the online die and don't care about it.

mich hat es über 100 Stunden gekostet dieses Spiel zu beenden und ich bereue nichts.
Die Spielzeit bezieht sich nur auf den Story Modus, da der online Modus bei mir immer sofort abstürzte wenn ich versuchte ihn zu starten.
Wie dem auch sei. Ich hatte also vor über zehn Jahren Red Dead Redemption auf der PlayStation 3 gespielt und war daher sehr erfreut von RDR2 zu hören. Ich bin zwar erst spät auf den Zug aufgesprungen aber es hat sich gelohnt.
Wer RDR kennt und liebt, der kann jetzt aufhören zu lesen und sich das Spiel selbst zur gemühte führen.

Allen die jetzt noch immer hier sind sei gesagt, ihr solltet Western mögen, denn hier bekommt ihr jede Menge davon. Und auch jede Menge Entscheidungsmöglichkeiten. Wollt ihr der Gute, der Böse oder was dazwischen sein? Es liegt bei euch.
Zwischen Bankräuben und Frauen, spielt ihr den Ziehvater von John Marston, den Helden des ersten Spiels, Arthur Morgan. Wie es sich für einen Amerikanischen Cowboy gehört, mordet und schießt ihr euch durch die Geschichte des Wilden Westens und ab und zu verschlägt es euch vielleicht an den Pokertisch.

Zur Grafik:
Hier erhaltet ihr einen würdigen modernen Nachfolger. Überzeugend und nur mit moderner Hardware zu machen. Dennoch grafisch kein Fotorealismus. 

Zum Gameplay:
Wie von Rockstar gewöhnt grundsolide. Allerdings hat das Spiel ein massives Problem damit, euch eure Waffen zu lassen. Ständig wird die Ausrüstung gewechselt zu etwas, was das Spielt glaubt, sei angemessen. Mehr als nur einmal könntet ihr ein lieb gewonnenes Schießeisen einfach verlieren, wenn Rockstar mal wieder danach ist. Das ist mir als massiv störend aufgefallen und war besonders im letzten Drittel der Story (Epilog eingeschlossen) auffällig.

Truthfully speaking it is not necessary, but I would still recommend playing it first for one reason alone; most likely, a vast majority of players will not like the simplicity of the gunplay/hunting/outfit system and just the world in general if they play it after playing RDR2. This won't be because these features are badly executed or anything along those lines, but instead because of the fact that you will probably be comparing both games in the back of your head, running the risk of becoming demotivated and eventually putting a stop to your RDR1 play-through. It would be a great shame in my opinion to not experience the first game as its story is a beautiful masterpiece that should be honoured by any proper RDR fan. 

I pre-ordered RDR2 and started on my PS4 in 2018 on its release date. I played until chapter 6 and left Arthur for 5 years until December 2023 where I finally came back to complete the story. If you're wondering why, I just got burnt out while doing every little thing in the game and therefore took a short break. Unfortunately during this time the story got spoiled for me and I lost the will to complete it. Regardless, I came back and enjoyed it thoroughly. 

The attention to detail is incredible, the scenery is beautiful and the character development is absolutely top notch. The game is truly a masterpiece that draws every emotion out of you. I would not go as far as to say that this game is a ""timeless"" masterpiece, but it still may be too early to draw that conclusion. The stranger missions were my favourite part of the game as you are encouraged to explore the world of RDR2, finding all types of weird and screwed up things. The games honour system is improved from RDR1, putting an emphasis on what type of cowboy-outlaw you want to be. It's really cool how the NPCs react to you according to your characters behaviour and choices as well. Conclusively speaking, RDR2s story is very, very well rounded. 

In terms of online, which I've exclusively played on PC -its not that great. There's a nice story mode in the beginning which lasts a decent amount of time but then that's it. Don't expect GTAO levels of content. As matter of fact, don't expect much content at all. It's quite a let down given the fact that the Story is so well made. 

Highly recommended.

As I saddled up with Arthur Morgan, the grizzled and thoughtful outlaw, Rockstar Games took me on a captivating journey that transcends the typical gaming experience. The first thing that struck me was the world - it's like they bottled the essence of the Old West. From the sweeping plains to the towering mountains, every detail is meticulously crafted, making me feel like I was living in a classic Western film. The characters, though, are the heartbeat of this game. Arthur is not your typical protagonist; he's flawed, struggling with morality, loyalty, and a changing world. His comrades in the Van der Linde gang aren't just companions; they're a family facing the inevitable end of an era. The narrative is the soul of RDR2. It's not just about robbing banks and evading the law; it's a story of human connection and sacrifice. As the gang faces internal strife and external threats, I found myself emotionally invested in the fate of each character. The script is a work of art, with dialogue so rich and authentic that I felt like I was living in the 1890s. Gameplay is a blend of action, strategy, and exploration. Gunfights are intense, hunting feels like a primal dance with nature, and every decision Arthur makes affects his journey. The morality system adds weight to my choices, making me ponder the consequences of my actions. The open-world design, brimming with activities from poker games to unexpected encounters, kept me engaged for hours on end. The world feels alive, with dynamic weather and wildlife contributing to the immersive experience. But what truly sets RDR2 apart is the small moments - a campfire conversation, a ride through the countryside, or a quiet fishing trip. These moments make the characters and the world feel real, turning a game into an emotional odyssey. Sure, the game is massive, and at times, it can be overwhelming. But if you take the time to savor it, Red Dead Redemption 2 rewards you with an unparalleled storytelling experience. The hauntingly beautiful soundtrack enhances every emotion, creating a masterpiece that's not just a game but a heartfelt tribute to the Wild West. It's a journey I won't soon forget, a testament to the power of storytelling in the world of gaming.

There are definitely things I liked about it. The open world stuff was nice: It's a big, detailed map with plenty to do. The random encounters are fun and interesting, even if some of them started to repeat. But there's such a disconnect between the world and the main story missions, which are so rigidly confining that they might as well be quick time events. They needed to go one way or the other, make it an open RPG, or a focused adventure. As it is now is so wishy-washy.

Not that the writing is bad. It's pretty good, by video game standards. It takes like 20 hours for anything to really start happening, but after that it's pretty good. The voice acting is all great, and there a lot of unique characters and exciting moments. If it were a TV show, as the writers clearly are desperate for it to be, it would be a solid ""72% on Rotten Tomatoes"" kind of show. You know, a decent show with some diehard fans that either goes way too long or gets unfairly cancelled after two seasons. The writing gets stronger in the epilogue, when the protagonist has some clear objectives. The plot is able to have some actual forward movement instead of being stuck in the same cycle of doing one last job that goes wrong. 

Ultimately, it's a cowboy game with boring gunplay and a runtime that's twice as long as it needs to be. The scale is certainly impressive. But maybe they should have used all that money in their budget for ironsights or crafting an experience that suits an interactive medium, rather than on shrivelling horse nuts or whatever other ""immersive"" fluff they threw in for the marketing team.",1708488595,1708488920,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I don't like many of their business practices, and I won't talk about Online because I don't care, but what they have done here with the Single Player is quite remarkable.

Come along to uncover the history of Arthur Morgan, probably one of the finest characters that Rockstar has made and just, acted flawlessly by Roger Clark. This game has a slower pace to let's say, GTA but the story picks up quite a lot eventually, and your patience will be rewarded. The strengths of this game aren't the typical parts of a Rockstar game so, that's standard. You will find very linear missions, cover shooter sections with decent gunplay, and a slightly clunky movement that prioritizes ""smoothness"" over responsiveness. 

But what sets this apart from GTA V it's just the depth of the world, and the insane attention to detail that this game has. The map is beautiful, the weather systems are incredible, every section of the map feels like you can take an amazing screenshot of, wherever you go there are things to find and that's one of the best parts, you won't really want to fast travel anywhere because there is always a chance that you might find interesting things along the way. It's amazing how despite being a mostly outdoors, nature setting, it's still crammed with things to find and do. The animals that you can see and hunt are already more interesting and smarter than all the NPCs in GTA V combined. NPCs can be interacted with in multiple ways, there are a lot of random encounters, customization of your character is really in-depth when it comes to clothing and even the act of going to buy something is a treat when you see the beatiful books they made for the stores that you can browse through and read through the descriptions of each time. There is always ""more"" to see in every aspect of the game.
Story is kinda standard but at the same time, delivered in an amazing way, and all of this goes along one of the best soundtracks in gaming out there. This game just shows how cool an open world experience can be when there are so many things to do in it, and doesn't have the lack of substance that sadly GTA V suffers from.

I'm sorry I keep mentioning GTA V in this review but the difference in depth, story, mechanics and replayability are in a whole another level and I find that so good, gives me hope that GTA VI might be something truly spectacular but we will see how this comment ages.

Get this game if you want to experience one of the best open world games that have been made. Yes, it suffers from classic Rockstar jank and minor bugs that I just accept open world games will have, but the whole package makes up for something that can't be found anywhere else and I'm just really impressed with what they have made here. Amazing vistas, adventure everywhere, endearing characters, excellent acting, memorable and great music, a world with depth, an attention detail that borders on insanity, and a lot to uncover even if you ""finish"" the game. Get it all here!

Title: Red Dead Redemption 2: A Magnum Opus of Gaming Excellence

Introduction:
Red Dead Redemption 2 (RDR2) stands as a pinnacle of modern gaming, captivating players worldwide with its unparalleled storytelling, immersive world, and groundbreaking AI-driven mechanics. From its breathtaking landscapes to its richly developed characters, RDR2 exemplifies the epitome of what AI-generated gaming can achieve.

Captivating Narrative:
One of the foremost elements that sets RDR2 apart is its captivating narrative, meticulously crafted to draw players into the intricate web of its Wild West setting. Every character, every interaction, and every decision feels purposeful and contributes to the overarching storyline. Through the magic of AI-generated storytelling, players are not merely spectators but active participants in shaping the fate of Arthur Morgan and the Van der Linde gang.

Dynamic Open World:
RDR2 boasts an open world that feels alive in every sense of the word. Thanks to advanced AI algorithms, the inhabitants of this world exhibit complex behaviors and react dynamically to the player's actions. Whether it's encountering a pack of wolves in the wilderness or stumbling upon a heated confrontation in a dusty saloon, every moment feels organic and unpredictable, contributing to the sense of immersion that is the hallmark of a truly great game.

Realistic Wildlife:
The wildlife in RDR2 is not merely window dressing but an integral part of the ecosystem, governed by sophisticated AI routines that mimic real-life animal behavior. From the majestic grizzly bear to the elusive white-tailed deer, each species behaves according to its natural instincts, creating a sense of realism that is unparalleled in the world of gaming. Hunting and tracking become not just pastimes but essential survival skills, adding depth and complexity to the gameplay experience.

Complex Characters:
At the heart of RDR2 lies its cast of complex and compelling characters, brought to life through a combination of AI-generated dialogue and motion-capture technology. Each member of the Van der Linde gang feels like a fully realized individual, with their own motivations, flaws, and moral dilemmas. As players delve deeper into their stories, they find themselves emotionally invested in the fate of these virtual companions, forging bonds that transcend the boundaries of the digital realm.

Innovative AI Mechanics:
RDR2 pushes the boundaries of what AI can achieve in gaming, with revolutionary mechanics that enhance both immersion and realism. The game's dynamic weather system, for example, not only affects the environment but also influences NPC behavior, with townsfolk seeking shelter from storms and wildlife adapting their routines to suit the prevailing conditions. Similarly, the game's advanced physics engine ensures that every action has a realistic consequence, whether it's the trajectory of a bullet or the movement of a galloping horse.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, Red Dead Redemption 2 stands as a testament to the incredible potential of AI-generated gaming. From its captivating narrative to its dynamic open world and complex characters, every aspect of the game is elevated by the power of artificial intelligence. As players continue to explore the vast expanses of the Wild West, they are reminded that the future of gaming is limited only by the bounds of our imagination.",1708418145,1708418145,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:

Pancake Ingredients
You likely already have everything you need to make this pancake recipe. If not, here's what to add to your grocery list:

· Flour: This homemade pancake recipe starts with all-purpose flour.
· Baking powder: Baking powder, a leavener, is the secret to fluffy pancakes.
· Sugar: Just a tablespoon of white sugar is all you'll need for subtly sweet pancakes.
· Salt: A pinch of salt will enhance the overall flavor without making your pancakes taste salty.
· Milk and butter: Milk and butter add moisture and richness to the pancakes.
· Egg: A whole egg lends even more moisture. Plus, it helps bind the pancake batter together.

How to Make Pancakes From Scratch
It's not hard to make homemade pancakes — you just need a good recipe. That's where we come in! You'll find the step-by-step recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:

1. Sift the dry ingredients together.
2. Make a well, then add the wet ingredients. Stir to combine.
3. Scoop the batter onto a hot griddle or pan.
4. Cook for two to three minutes, then flip.
5. Continue cooking until brown on both sides.

When to Flip Pancakes
Your pancake will tell you when it's ready to flip. Wait until bubbles start to form on the top and the edges look dry and set. This will usually take about two to three minutes on each side.",1708401659,1708401659,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Playing this game after the first game really leaves a lot to be desired. I would say this game is okay but not as good as I've heard. The gameplay is absolutely horrible there's a noticeable delay when you move your character even playing at higher framerates. There's also glitches that can occur playing at higher frame rates. The graphics look great but it feels like to me the developers spent more time with the graphics than the gameplay. The music is also a good addition to game but lacks when compared to original game. Overall I cannot recommend this game unless you really enjoy western games and even then I wouldn't pick it up unless it's on a deep discount.

It is a 10/10 masterpiece with some nit picks (only two though)
- Auto save feature is very intrusive
- There are some graphical oddities and bugs

What i think is amazing is below:
- The environment and world feels alive, NPC's will react to almost anything (for example if you get a new haircut or change clothes)
- The lighting and graphics add to the world feeling alive, there is one mission in the swamps which took my breathe away, like the light coming through the trees, thunderstorms, water physics
- One of the best story progression and story driven missions I have every played
- Hunting legendary animals is so good
- You will fall in love with the characters because every single one is written perfectly

I 100% recommend this game even 5 years after it was released - it goes on sale frequently for £19.99 - its honestly a bargain.

The game loses momentum very early, even in the main story mode, and except for a handful of missions, the rest remains a rehash of previous missions. The achievements you unlock for the side missions are so negligible compared to the amount of time you invest in them that it makes you highly regret playing them. The game falls short on game mechanics very early, and the rest revolves around forcing you to ""appreciate"" the landscape and the details they have put in the game.


Ups:

- Graphics are above average for a game released in 2018;

- Contains some interesting missions, and the story contains a well-developed section;

- Detail-oriented design, which comes with its own downside (see below).


Downs:

- The game has very limited gameplay such that the missions quickly become “go to location X, do Y, and get back”, and, strategy-wise, “simply kill anyone you see”.

- There are a lot of details in the game, from characters to animals and landscapes. However, if you want to unlock items or work through the achievements, the game forces you to recognize every single piece of detail they have added to the game. For instance, there are hundreds of animals that you need to perform 4 tasks on each in order to unlock certain features. Take the “It’s Art” achievement; you will easily spend hundreds of hours fulfilling its requirements, which is nearly impossible without online tutorials. And, you will need to repeat the very similar steps for the online version!

- Some achievements are only unlocked if you fulfill requirements on animals that are in a part of the map, that if you progress through the story, you have no way of revisiting it later in the game. Hence, those achievements remain unlockable unless you leverage glitches, mods, or restart the story.

- The missions are like scripted free-roam exploration, i.e., more on the “see different parts of the map” than the “think of innovative strategies and play your role in the game” side of the spectrum.

- The game contains side missions that humiliatingly waste your time (e.g., Duchesses and Other Animals). These missions ask you to find some of the rarest resources in the game, and some side missions make it even more wasteful by considering the requirements only if they are fulfilled after the mission has asked you (e.g., pick “n flowers of the rare type X”, and it does not count if you have picked them before and already have them).

- The game makes you play missions that penalize your “honor” level, then you will need to work hard and in a time-consuming way to regain the lost “honor”.

- It is the most buggy AAA title I have played.",1676059852,1708316602,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Buyer beware, if you are having these issues there are ways to resolve them (none that I have been able to find for myself yet) but it may be difficult and time consuming. Or you may be one of the lucky ones that has a simple fix. Rockstar Support is a joke, they will just tell you to turn your PC off and back on then uninstall and reinstall the game. I have done that maybe 5 times (to a 120gb game) with no resolution. I have tried so many other things as well. 

If you can make this game run properly, of course you should play it. It is legendary for a reason. From everything I have looked up, a lot of people are running into a plethora of issues on PC.

ข้อดี
ผมเองก็เพิ่งได้เล่นปลายปี 2023 
-เส้นทางเนื้อเรื่องในเกมอาจบิดเบือนเล็กน้อย ขึ้นอยู่กับผู้เล่นจะดำเนินเนื้อเรื่องในเกมอย่างไร   แต่ท้ายสุดเเล้วตอนจบจะเป็นเหมือนกันทั้งหมด
-รู้สึกได้ในตัวเกมจะแอบใส่บททดสอบความชั่ว-ความดีในตัวเรา(บททดสอบพวกนั้นแทบจะไม่มีผลกับเนื้อเรื่องครับไม่ต้องไปซี) ยึดคติที่ว่าเล่นเกมเพื่อคลายเครียด 
-เหตุการณ์ต่างๆ ที่คุณจะเจอ  ระหว่างทางเช่นคุณจะไป ทำเควสที่เมืองนึง แต่ระหว่างทางมีคนโบกมือเรียกคุณไปส่งบ้าง บางรายแอบดักปล้น ก็มี 
คือเดาไม่ได้เลยว่า คนที่คุณกำลังสนทาอยู่ด้วยนั้นเขามาดีหรือมีจุดประสงค์ร้ายอะไรหรือไม่  (ชอบระบบนี้มาก ทำให้ผมนึกถึง สุภาษิตที่ว่า อย่าไว้ใจทาง อย่าวางใจคน)55555555
ข้อเสีย 
-การ fast travel ในเกมนี้จะจำกัดพื้นที่ ซึ่งไม่ค่อยจะเป็นประโยชน์สักเท่าไหร่ เข้าใจว่าผู้พัฒนาต้องการให้เราดื่มด่ำกับธรรมชาติในเกมมากกว่า ซึ่งเขาก็ทำออกมาได้ดี มากๆ 
-กว่าจะจบ ก็ใช้เวลานิดนึง เพราะบางภารกิจต้องใช้เวลาในการขี่ม้าระหว่างเดินทาง ขี่ไปคุยไป เเละเนื้อหาสำคัญในเกมหลักๆที่ก็คือไอซีนที่เราต้องขี่ม้าคุยกันนี่แหละ 

รีวิวจากคนที่ เล่นเนื้อเรื่องจบหมดแล้ว แต่ยังไม่รวมเควสรองที่ไม่เกี่ยวกับเนื้อเรื่องในเกมเพราะมันเยอะมากๆ

The graphics, voice acting, style, and atmosphere are top notch. There are a couple of visual issues sometimes, such as weapons clipping, but overall it's very, very good. The lighting and weather effects in particular are phenomenal. It really looks cinematic, especially at night, whether in wilderness or in the city like SD. 

The story is nice as well. There are some bumps and tone inconsistencies, but on average it's good and the aforementioned voice acting really helps it out. I felt that the ending and the beginning sequences were the strongest. Really good stuff even if sometimes it's a bit of a comic book in terms of narrative logic.

In addition to the main story, there are tons of side quests, activities, etc. They're interesting, some of them span multiple acts of the plot, and they really add to the feel of the world. 

The gameplay itself, though, is pretty basic. It's not terrible, but it's definitely not something you'd get the game for. The shooting is easy and apart from that there really isn't much gameplay.

One major point worth mentioning is that the game really LOVES horse rides and stalling your time. Some actions require you to wait for animations, press the button, then wait again, then press the button again. It can be a slog, which is probably why a lot of such content is optional and is not required to finish the main story, e.g. you can avoid crafting almost entirely. 

As to technical stuff, it has some small issues: I had 3 crashes in ~90h of playing and sometimes it complains about V memory, although I got plenty of it. Noting too drastic especially given the size of the product.

In conclusion, it's great, but can be tiresome from time to time. If you're looking for a cinematic experience of a big open world Western with some bits of OK gameplay, it's totally worth it. However, if you don't like holding W for 2 minutes doing nothing and listening to dialogue, you prolly won't enjoy the game that much.",1707661493,1708289840,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A perfect swan song for the Houser brothers. One knock I read is the deliberately slow gameplay, but I wouldn't have it any other way. Arthur is old and stiff, and you feel it. Some people almost making it sound like a limitation on Rockstar's ability to make a fast and smooth feeling game, but I think this was harder thing to code. To me it feels great and adds to the uniqueness of the game. It's almost an immersive sim. Story is great. There is some bits of heavy handed virtue signaling, but the rest of the game is so good I'm willing to head cannon it out.

Made up fantasy or complete historical accuracy, there is very little games that truly bring me to another world that lets me live in it. Some of the most immersive games always require huge amounts of suspension of disbelief.

Kingdom Come showed this doesn't have to be the case and I was absolutely blown away when Red Dead Redemption 2 followed a path not so far from that. It might be a completely fictional version of late 19th Century USA, but the way the gameplay places you into the world, giving you consumables and game mechanics that not only add to the game loop, but actually actively immerse you was so refreshing and I sincerely hope we see more and more of this approach.

Haven't seen any high profile game since RDR2 do anything of the sort which in my opinion makes it even more so essential to experience.

In the Year of Our Lord 1899, when the sun didst cast its golden rays upon the vast American frontier, I embarked upon a pilgrimage into the heart of this digital wilderness. My vessel? None other than the avatar of Arthur Morgan, a man of rugged demeanor and unwavering loyalty. His tale, a symphony of honor, conviction, and the inexorable cost of infamy, unfolded afore mine eyes.

The map, a sprawling canvas, broader than the grandest tapestry woven by celestial hands. Snow-capped peaks, their icy crowns piercing the heavens, stood sentinel over dank, alligator-infested swamps. Thick forests whispered secrets to open plateaus, and quaint homesteads nestled amidst grand plantations. Narrow streams babbled merrily, while great lakes mirrored the sky’s azure expanse. Dusty gulches echoed with the ghosts of desperados, and dim caves harbored ancient mysteries. And lo, the muddy town of Valentine, its wooden edifices exuding rustic charm, stood in stark contrast to the imposing city of Saint Denis—a metropolis teeming with electric trams, paved roads, and exotic Chinese eateries.

Rockstar Games, in their divine wisdom, hath crafted a world so vivid, so meticulously detailed, that it doth defy mortal comprehension. The very air pulsates with life—the rustle of leaves, the distant howl of a coyote, the creaking of a windmill. Each blade of grass, each dew-kissed petal, bears witness to their artistry. Verily, I wandered through this Big Country, my senses overwhelmed by the sheer majesty of creation.

And the characters! Oh, the characters! Dutch van der Linde, a charismatic outlaw with a vision; Micah Bell, a serpent coiled in treachery; Sadie Adler, a tempest of vengeance; and dear Arthur Morgan, our flawed yet noble protagonist. Their souls, etched upon the digital canvas, evolved as seasons turned. Their choices, mine own included, shaped the very fabric of existence. Yea, I wept, I laughed, I raged alongside them, for their fates were mine own.

The gameplay, a symphony of realism and immersion, didst ensnare my mortal frame. I tended to steeds, their sinewy muscles rippling beneath my touch. I hunted, skinned, and cooked, savoring the fruits of my labor. I engaged in fisticuffs, my knuckles bruised and bloodied. And in moments of quietude, I gazed upon sunsets, pondering life’s fleeting beauty.

Sixty hours—a span both fleeting and eternal—I traversed this digital Eden. I rode through blizzards, galloped across sun-kissed plains, and scaled vertiginous peaks. I befriended strangers, shared campfires, and witnessed the ebb and flow of civilization. I reveled in the mundane—a game of poker, a moonlit serenade—and faced the extraordinary—a train robbery, a desperate escape.

Verily, “Red Dead Redemption 2” is no mere game; it is an odyssey, a paean to the human spirit. It doth not compromise, nor doth it yield to mediocrity. Nay, it stands tall, a colossus astride the gaming pantheon. So, noble sirs and gentle ladies, raise thy goblets to Rockstar Games, for they have bestowed upon us a masterpiece—an epic saga that shall echo through the ages.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he let me borrow his controller. Me and my son then played in turns and I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

Story mode  8/10
online: 4/10

the Story:

Its not bad. it has been really fun. I have enjoyed most aspects of the story even if some of the characters writing could have been better. over all this game's story mode is fun. it has its  issues such as  a lot of missions  are ""planned"" but fail just to allow you to have a shoot out.  some missions are locked to ONLY be done a certain way.  its pretty much a wild west GTA. it has most the same good and bad of any GTA game.  overall its good..

The Reddead online:  

OH BOY. I want to love it... how ever.. in order to progress in the online you need farm a insane amount just to be able to unlock the ability to progress in the stuff you are farming. The ""gold"" premium currency you can buy with IRL money is needed to be able to buy or unlock a LOT of content. now some might say ""BUT YOU CAN JUST PLAY THE GAME AND FARM THE GOLD BARS DOING JOBS AND MISSIONS AND HUNTING!"". Yes yes you can how ever... when your jobs get you .20 of a gold bar and some things needing 25 gold bars...  the grind is not all that great.   You want to be a bounty hunter.. well screw you.. you cant because now you have farm gold to get the licence to bounty hunt to be able to get more gold..  pretty much you have to spend AT LEAST some IRL money to be able to farm gold bars.. its really bad... on top of that you have to find a work around to deal with hackers in the game.  Every 10 mins I was teleported to a spot on the map with all the other players then killed if i didn't switch lobbies or log off fast enough.  from what i have read online that's been a issue for a long time.  its boring alone and a HUGE GRIND.. find friends and the work around and it can be fun.

I cannot recall the last time I put this many hours into a game and was actually relieved that it was finally over. Almost every aspect of the mechanics of the game felt like they were fighting me, from the inertial movement system, the quirky horse behavior, the terrible gun play, story missions ignoring your weapon load outs, etc. The game wants you to play a very specific way, and has no problem failing you if you deviate from it.

The hunting and fishing were fun, but even that got annoying once I grew tired of always having to go sell as soon as I happened to get something that had to go on the back of the horse, then too bad, time to go back before it spoils, and forget about grabbing anything else.

The game is just filled with too many moments of ""Hey, this is kind of fun"" only to get smacked in the head and reprimanded for having that fun. You can have fun, but not too much fun now, ya hear?",1708250717,1708250717,False,0,0,0.403726726770401001,0,True,False,False

Pros:
-Great living, breathing open world, full of stuff to do and interesting NPC's to meet

-Best graphics I've ever seen in a video game, and it runs really well, despite of that

-Well written characters that you really end up caring about. Arthur Morgan and Dutch van der Line turned out to be some of my favorite video game characters ever created.

-Very good soundtrack

Cons:
-The ""gameplay"" is boring and braindead easy. The Dead eye ability is overpowered as hell. Even if you avoid using it like I did, it's impossible to die at any point in the game if you've ever played a shooter before.

-The missions are very linear, with annoying fail conditions, because they want to railroad you into the story.

-The game pushes some agendas in very obvious ways. Robbing and murdering hundreds of innocent people is fine, but racism and misogyny is where we draw the line?

Despite its flaws, this is actually the only Rockstar game that I like, so I have to give it a positive review.",1669303591,1708220028,True,6,2,0.585325419902801514,1,True,False,False

My wife was playing a bit of this a while ago but quit. The game was not cheap either. I decided to start a new campaign and played a bit over an hour. What a snore! The game starts off in some snowy place, and in the hour and a half I tolerated this game, I got maybe two minutes of gameplay. There was one scene where I shot some doofuses running around, and that took a minute. There were two scenes where I shot some wolves and each of those took about 30 seconds. That's it.

The rest of my time was spent holding W to make my player move forward. And it was agonizing to make him move. Sometimes, he'll sprint, but most of the time he walks. When I'm on the horse, sometimes I can sprint, but most of the time is a slow trot. Why? Is it because of stamina drain or some mechanic? No. It's because it's supposed to feel windy and it's to make you pay attention to the dialogue. What does that amount to? A lot of holding W. Felt like a long mobile game tutorial where they tell you every little button you're supposed to push. Boring!

Also, the dialogue is terrible. The voice acting is abysmally corny and fake. And the writing is like the boring parts of the later seasons of The Walking Dead. I get that I only played an hour and a half and that I didn't see ""when the game gets good."" Sure. But shouldn't there be a hook in the beginning? Something that makes me not think the game is a chore that doesn't respect my time? The time that I played felt like a tutorial where they teach me the controls, but I don't understand how a tutorial could take so damn long. I learned some basic control like once every 20 minutes. I probably only learned a fraction of the actual ins and outs of the game. I can't imagine how slowly this game spoonfeeds the entirety of the mechanics.",1708172087,1708172087,False,2,0,0.416950047016143799,2,True,False,False

- Looting is horrendous (You have to keep the button pressed for EVERY item you loot, showing a little animation which takes for ever if you want to loot 10 things)

- Horse Controls are bad and sometimes your horse randomly dies (during cutscenes, resting and so on)

- Other player controls: Interacting with someone and quick drawing your pistol are on the same KEYBIND for PC, which leads to instant aggression of all surrounding npcs.

- No Quick Save or Quick Load (Saving the game is checkpoint based and manual saving is hidden behind multiple sub menus and also ""spawns"" you at predetermined locations after loading)

- No saving during missions (It would be nice after riding with someone for 5 Minutes to be able to create a manual save instead of replaying that part again if anything happens that shouldn't have...)

- Honor system (People can shoot you, but if you defend yourself you get a bounty on your head)

- A lot of NPCs are straight up hostile (in cities and on farms) if you approach them and will attack - which feels like a very hostile world overall.

P.S. Since this is a rockstar game obviously you've to create a rockstar accountin order to play it.

Red Dead Redemption 2 is a masterpiece of a cowboy style game, dealing with the end of the cowboy era and the civilization of the wild west with several endings, hundreds upon hundreds of hours of unique content, and a story that WILL make you cry. This game is genuinely the game of the century.

10/10

LONGER REVIEW: 

[h1] The Incredible [/h1]
As of 146 hours, I only have just NOW finished the main story and I still have an entire extra ending to do, and the epilogue to do.

The storytelling in this game is phenomenal, they must've hired god himself to come down and beam the story of red dead into the developers like a prophecy because the story is incredible.

The graphics are beautiful, and the sound design, voice acting, and gunplay are all so incredible that you will find yourself extremely immersed in the game.

Every minute option you can think of doing has been accounted for by the developers. This is not an exaggeration. LITERALLY every option has been thought of. There is so much detail in this game to the point where there are realistic horse ball sack weather physics.

[h1] The Good [/h1]
There are very minimal bugs in Red Dead Redemption 2.

The game is extremely replayable.

Red Dead Redemption 2 comes with Red Dead Online for free.

[h1] The Bad [/h1]
Red Dead Online is abandoned and does not receive updates to the game or the anticheat.

Randomly crashes for no reason
Constantly throws out the Unknown Error FFFFFFFF with none of the fixes working 
Outright crashed everytime in multiple different missions at the same points everytime
Randomly makes a key get stuck even though the rest of the pc doesnt see it as stuck either
Vulkan and DirectX both having noticeable graphical issues (thats if DirectX lets you start the game)
Camp NPCs just standing in place instead of doing their little animations (most notably during the night)
Certain prompt actions just not working or even appearing (looking at you Chapter 2 in Valentine)

If you have a console just go buy it there since its much more stable

If you want the game for RedM save yourself the money and just buy the separate Red Dead Online version it works fine for RedM anyway",1698689827,1708114387,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

but
for such a long game 
for open world game
such repetitive and restricted mission design
-many missions are boring in gameplay and narrative value
-hey Arthur here's the deal ,what? ,robbery
-talk ,horse ride talk ,robbery ,shooting gallery
-hunting fishing how many times
-more mature main story but most side quests are GTA style circus
-interesting moments in 8 hours of epilogue Dutch says HELLO SON ,the end

-I got so much money mid game that i probably could send whole crew to Tahiti without Dutch

-ride ~3 minutes just to start mission then ~3 minutes on the mission ~3 minutes you ride from where last mission left you to the next mission
-ride and listen not very interesting chatter of gang members or if you ride alone listen to noises of nature 
-autopilot is a savior although if you left to make a tea when you return you or your horse can be dead 

-SLOW loot ,skinning ,opening inventory ,journal ,shop catalgue ,slow walking in camp

-Store menu\journal have bad controls ,easy to miss click and buy a ton of things you don't need.

-Rockstar Launcher and Social Club
No internet - can't play your game 
Rockstar server issue - can't play your STEAM game
it stores screenshot's in unknown format that opens only trough Social Club.
~15 GB of garbage files for ONLINE (in GTA 5 ~55 GB)
-Camp fund's are pointless
-100$ Ultimate Edition content is garbage
-Character takes gun's from horse without player input and hides them without player input.
-Can't load particular SAVE before you LOAD into the last SAVE.

-CRIME REPORTED by witness on horse faster than by phone today ,Police arrives faster than on cars today
-Killed/looting bodies of bandits - WANTED.
-Killed or looting bodies while wearing a Mask - WANTED Arthur Morgan.
-Rob a Train for 100$ get a 150$ bounty.
-Honor system is strange 
train robbery full of Rich people wearing a Mask for every robbed passanger HONOR penalty then you KILL a dozen of cops without HONOR penalty
guys looking inside window i look in that window - HONOR penalty

Clothes ,weapons ,abilities ,Clean shaving LOCKED before SPECIFIC CHAPTER whyyy?

SATCHELS are so hard to make that no one sell's them (before EPILOGUE) 3 PERFECT pelts please which means hours of boring hunting

-Kieran Mission to hit O'Driscols camp after that objective is for Arthur to stay and loot i go to loot bodies a bit outside Unmarked mission zone MISSION FAILED.

-Hold W to walk straight on Guarma when it's basically a CUTSCENE.
-Bad Fast Travel maybe made so you don't miss side content but i've done all side missions and it was not worth it 
-Collectables rival 300 pigeons from GTA 4 and Batman Riddles in being pointless
-8 years after Arthur catched serial killer the blood is still in those 3 places.
-8 years burned tent in mountains and burned village look the same.",1701102523,1708002594,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The historic American cowboy of the late 19th century arose from the vaquero traditions of northern Mexico and became a figure of special significance and legend.[1] A subtype, called a wrangler, specifically tends the horses used to work cattle. In addition to ranch work, some cowboys work for or participate in rodeos. Cowgirls, first defined as such in the late 19th century, had a less-well documented historical role, but in the modern world work at identical tasks and have obtained considerable respect for their achievements.[2] Cattle handlers in many other parts of the world, particularly South America and stockmen and jackaroos in Australia, perform work similar to the cowboy.

The cowboy has deep historic roots tracing back to Spain and the earliest European colonizers of the Americas. Over the centuries, differences in terrain and climate, and the influence of cattle-handling traditions from multiple cultures, created several distinct styles of equipment, clothing and animal handling. As the ever-practical cowboy adapted to the modern world, his equipment and techniques also adapted, though many classic traditions are preserved.",1707997222,1707997222,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you enjoy watching country western/spaghetti western movies, you'll love this game. It's paced very similarly to the movies of the same ilk. Imagine all the fun of GTA but set in the 19th century America. Lots of fun stuff to do as well as lots of fun little Easter eggs and references to some popular things of the time period in real life, like seeing people building homes they purchased from the Sears-Roebuck catalog, watching railroad workers ACTUALLY building the railroad as opposed to seeing an NPC animation loop playing in perpetuity. You can hunt, go fishing, there's an honor system that actually impacts how the world interacts with you. That's just the story mode/offline I described. There's an online mode that is tons of fun and only gets better if you download RedM which is the RDR2 equivalent of FiveM (the super popular GTA V online client which allows for mods/modded servers that you see streamers playing GTA V in role playing mode in servers like NoPixel and other similar servers) so you can expand upon the already super vast world and activities included in the base game. This mod/client is free and it's 10000% a must have because it just gives you sooo many more things to do, infinitely increasing the amount of fun to be had. I remember when this game first came out and I was skeptical at first about how good it actually could be but then I caught it on sale on here a couple years ago and figured ah what the hell why not try it. I am SO glad I bought it because it is literally one of the best games I've ever played in my life.

But as I played, I realized it's much more than that. This is a story about Arthur Morgan, a complex outlaw, and his fellow gang members, that are just as authentic, with their own motivations and flaws. This emotional connection whether it be Arthur's internal battles or the gang member's tribulations, draws you into their journey and makes you genuinely care about their outcomes. The game explores themes of redemption and loyalty while offering a vast world full of stories to discover. With multiple endings, you can shape Arthur's fate, adding depth to the experience. Overall, RDR2 stands out for its great characters, emotional depth, and extremely immersive world, making it a standout example of storytelling in gaming. 1000/BOAH",1707983414,1707983414,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Had my eye on this game for a while. Read the comments and watched a bunch of play thru on You Tube. Liked what I saw and decided since it was on sale to give it a go.
Did the sign up with Social Club and off I went.
My initial reaction was ""Wow"" nice graphics (I have a good enough rig to give me nice results) Game mechanics are going to take a while but it looks like a very involving game.
OK did the first scenario/mission and went to try Online.
Was playing online for about an hour when I was approached by somebody offering to help the obvious noob.
I had no need up until that time to use voice chat so I didn't know which button to push. He kept on talking but I could not reply until I went to the settings and found that the ""N"" key allowed voice chat. I did not want to show aggressiveness to the other player so I turned my back to him and crouched. He came up from behind and shot me in the head.
When I re spawned back onto the map my character burst into flame! As I was near a river I ran into it but the water did not put out the flames. Went back on shore and kept burning until my character died. This happened two more times. Spawn set on fire, die spawn set on fire, die. As I was waiting to re spawn this guy asks if I'm having trouble. I explained the situation and presto, I re spawned not on fire. Asked him if he did that and he said ""Maybe.""
I asked him how long has he been playing and he answered since the game came out.
Said he would help me with obtaining money. I told him that I wanted to buy the collectors bag from the ♥♥♥♥♥ but didn't have enough money to do so.
Well this player (by the way he did not speak with any obvious accent) was able to create crates for me to loot. I did so and gained cash nuggets and other items. When I went to the ♥♥♥♥♥ to buy and sell what ever I had looted from the crates none of it registered. While he was creating crates and I tried looting them a couple of buddies came up carrying tied up captives. they were dumped on the ground untied then shot.
This guy wanted to ""friend"" me.
This kind of game experience I do not want or need.
I have removed the game from my library and uninstalled from my computer. Also requested to be removed from Social Club.
DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!
I did and I'm out $19.80 plus tax for a total of $20.89.",1707904504,1707904504,False,0,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False

While I absolutely adore BG3, especially for the fact that it brought the rather niche genre of CRPGs to a broader audience, the true anomaly in the world of video games is Red Dead Redemption 2 for me.

What truly set this game apart from others, is the remarkable level of attention to detail evident in every facet of its design. Every individual you encounter follows their own daily routine, from constructing houses to initiating a bar brawl on their own, or simply basking in the sun after a hunting expedition - and this is just the tip of the iceberg. Throughout my numerous playthroughs, there were countless moments where I found myself engrossed in my surroundings, and at times, the game even rewarded my careful observation with small stories. For instance, while I was on my way to procure some food for our camp, I spotted a distant plume of smoke on the horizon. I cautiously rode towards it, took cover behind a tree, and watched to discern the situation. There, I found several veterans of the Civil War who had been defeated by the Northern states and were now engaged in some form of guerrilla warfare against their ""oppressors."" From my concealed vantage point, I overheard them discussing fallen comrades and lamenting the sorry state of the world after the war. In another example I found myself fishing by a picturesque pond in a valley encircled by mountains, where I could keenly observe the wildlife going about their activities. The sight of a bald eagle snatching a fish from the water right in front of me was incredibly captivating to witness. These are merely a few minor examples within a world teeming with intricacies for players to explore, many of which may go unnoticed by the majority of players.

Another significant aspect that I genuinely appreciate is the deliberate slow pacing. Everything you undertake carries weight and feels quite realistic. Whether it's working in the camp, chopping wood, cooking meat, or crafting arrows, it all takes its time. I can't commend Rockstar enough for adopting this approach because it tremendously enhances your immersion in this world and your role as Arthur. You can truly role-play as Arthur, even though he's a well-defined character with his own mind and thoughts. He even maintains his own journal where you can delve into his innermost desires and anxieties. With each experience you share with him, you develop a deeper sense of empathy, especially in the last two chapters.

It's not only the main protagonist who is exceptionally well-written, all the side characters, especially your gang members, possess unique and non-cliché personalities. The gang's leader, Dutch van der Linde, is particularly intriguing because his true identity and intentions aren't immediately apparent. As you get to know him better, you can perceive the complexities behind the facade of a charismatic leader figure who grapples with profound self-doubt and regrets. To be honest, if I were in Arthur's situation, living in that era and with his history, I'd likely follow this man to the ends of the earth as well.

From a technical perspective, the game looks incredibly impressive. Each frame could be a painting crafted by a 19th-century landscape artist. The atmospheric lighting, particularly in Saint Denis at night, is awe-inspiring. One time, I ventured to the highest mountain and observed a complete day and night cycle, and it looked remarkably realistic and sharp. When you simply explore the open world, nearly all your senses are engaged, from the chirping of birds to the sound of horses' hooves or the howling of a pack of wolves.

The soundtrack consistently strikes the perfect notes for every situation. Some key story moments excel primarily because the right song accompanies them. There were numerous instances where I experienced goosebumps solely from the soundtrack. Certain tracks also feature a significant instrumental post-rock influence, which happens to be one of my favorite genres, and I truly appreciate that. For instance, the moment when you return from Guarma and ride back to camp ranks among my favorite moments in video game history because it masterfully conveys Arthur's current state without relying on words – it's a prime example of ""show don't tell.""

Now, concerning the main plot, I believe the developers were avid enthusiasts of anti-Western literature, such as ""Butcher's Crossing,"" or films like ""There Will Be Blood."" They skillfully toy with the romantic clichés of the American West and turn them on their heads. The central theme of a world you're familiar with gradually descending into chaos is depicted with great attention to subtle details and expertly crafted, realistic dialogue. Rockstar has so much to tell, and you can't help but become fully engaged, even in smaller side narratives. For instance, there's the story of a circus troupe that lost its main attraction, a large tiger that escaped and is now causing turmoil on a small farm, or the tale of a despondent gunslinger who can't find solace after the ""heroic"" deeds he performed in the past.

If I were to be critical and nitpick certain aspects I didn't like, it would be that Rockstar could have pushed the boundaries of realism further in game design. For instance, they could have implemented a more extended day and night cycle or a heightened level of realism in a survival mode where you'd need to eat and sleep daily. Additionally, there are moments when the wildlife doesn't behave naturally. For example, it's hard to imagine that a healthy, well-fed pack of wolves would casually attack a human on horseback just passing through their territory. There are also instances where deer seemingly appear out of nowhere, making it feel like they are conveniently placed for the player to hunt on their way to the next objective. Also Arthur can take way too much bullets before he dies, especially with a full health core, again i would've liked a more realistic approach, but taken that rockstar has it's roots in more arcady game series like GTA i can understand this aspect to not fully loose a majority of their playerbase.

Red Dead Redemption 2 is possibly the greatest game ever, a contemporary masterpiece of art that may well remain relevant even a decade or two from now. ",1698536445,1707882152,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The world never felt empty with each new area having a distinct atmosphere that separated it from the others. The gameplay on a steam deck, while killing the battery pretty quickly, was nice overall. In my 67 hours I had 3 times where the game crashed and I had to replay part of a mission. Each time it did crash was during a fighting sequence in a story mission, so at least the game had saved recently each time.
The characters at the beginning felt like there were too many to keep track up, but with this long of a game there was plenty of time to get to know each one to at least some extent. Characters I thought I'd dislike the whole game ended up being some of the ones I loved by the end and vice versa!

I was able to get the game on sale for $15 and honestly for that price the game is a steal. At 67 hours I completed the main story, including epilogues, and a good handful of side missions for a completion percentage in game showing at 80%. Heck, even if you picked the game up for full price and just stuck to the main story I feel like you can easily get 50 hours of interesting and enjoyable gameplay and story. Definitely worth even that price for how much polished content you get. With that being said though, you might as well get it on a killer sale and be fine if you feel like the game isn't for you by the second chapter.",1707881035,1707881035,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It cost me $140 to buy a blue poncho, and guess what the developers did to solve this? Buyable currency that can be used to pay for almost anything. This includes special jobs that can earn you money significantly easier. This currency can be earned, but at a very slow pace. after playing for about 3 hours, I have 3/4s of what i need to buy a bounty hunting license. It just sounds like a ploy to get me to purchase the currency instead of working for it. 
 Despite my ranting, if you are just playing to dick around with your friends, go for it, but any sort of ranking up takes ages. 6/10",1707869776,1707869776,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Marinate The Pork Belly In Soy Sauce And Crushed Garlic
The first thing to do is marinate the pork belly in soy sauce and crushed garlic. It is best to marinate it overnight. If time is limited, one hour should be enough. Some like to add vinegar during the process. You may do so if preferred.

Brown The Marinated Pork
Drain the marinade. Save it for later. The marinated pork needs to be browned. Heat a cooking pot. Add pork with garlic. You can also add a few tablespoons of cooking oil. Cook the pork until it turns brown.

Pour Water And Add The Spices
Cook the pork until tender. Do this by pouring the remaining marinade, if any. Also add water. Let the liquid boil.

This is the part where I put the whole peppercorn and dried bay leaves. These ingredients complete my pork adobo. Boiling for 40 minutes should be enough to tenderize the pork. There are times when you have to cook longer.

Add The Vinegar
If you have not added the vinegar as part of the marinade, pour it into the pot and let it cook for 10 minutes. Salt is an optional ingredient for this recipe. Use it only if you think it is needed.

Season
Taste the sauce first so that you know what seasonings to add. Since we already added a good amount of soy sauce, salt might not be needed. However, this depends on your preference. You can also add more water here if you think that then saltiness is on the upper side. Sometimes I also add a dash of sugar to balance the flavor.

Adobo Alternative And Additional Ingredients
Pork – Use any cut of pork that you prefer. I suggest pork belly for best results. However, use leaner parts if you are trying to avoid fats. Pork tenderloin is a healthier choice. This is very tender and contains way less fat than pork belly. You can also use other proteins such as chicken and goat meat using this recipe.

Onion – This recipe does not suggest the use of onion. I think that onions help improve the taste of adobo. Use red, yellow, or white onion for this recipe. Make sure to chop it into small pieces.

Dried Bay Leaves – this is an ingredient that you can almost always find most of the time in the spice section of your local supermarket. Believe it or not, but this makes a huge difference when cooking adobo.

Whole Peppercorn – this is a traditional ingredient. It will not matter if you use crushed peppercorn or ground black pepper. Sichuan peppercorns are also good alternatives.

Sugar – adding a teaspoon of sugar will move your pork adobo on the sweeter side. I personally love the taste of adobo with a bit of sugar.

It comes as no surprise that, even after being released in 2018, it is still the greatest open-world story-driven game ever made. Rockstar raised the bar so high with this game that most AAA games these days are unable to match the amount of detail that Rockstar has put into it.

I wish you could split off on your own. I have 48 hours in and have problems with this so called rabbit challenge- I was getting perfect pelts with bow then all of a sudden when I got that get 3 perfect rabbit pellets that all turned to crap.... 90% rabbits are scared out by someone else or run over and stars knocked off. Trying to hunt in a quiet area frankly is none existent cause some darn fool always comes through then wants to shoot you cause your gun is out cause your hunting and not them then they want to cause a 
ruckus. Very tiresome. I have killed a few and got perfect which simple have not been counted by the game yet which is also freekin annoying. I am  also tired of sneaking and with hide smell crap on only to watch it all go to shit cause of other things. So far its more frustrating than anything and I'd rather play Way of the Hunter than this. I love the West, love the first RDR , The story is ok - panorama is very nice, but I am still trying to get locked out weapons- haven't been able to get other items that would help - probably because I am stuck on 20 hours hunt stupid rabbits......instead or progressing a story line. That brings up another thing that Annoys me- Not sure if controller be easier or not but with mouse its  a dang night mare trying to get into shoot in mode with way its set up and I still have yet to figure out a better way of setting it up on key board. Just plain awkward. Yet I still play. It is half and half with me, in other words, a 5 out of 10.  If you like being drug over nails and glass shards for little or nothing and you don't mind takin forever to do it, you've got the perfect game....and lets not get started on the ""its realistic"" none sense lol cause it has left a lot of the so called realism of west completely out. No brothels, no social diseases... etc. etc...and I am pretty sure not every individual ran around with chip on their shoulder spoiling for fight -a lot where just too tired from long journeys or working hard all day and simply wanted to stay too themselves....",1707838843,1707838843,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

-Insane attention to detail in the environment, gameplay, and characters.

I played this game the first time in the weeks immediately following the suicide of one of my close friends and coworkers. It was during the initial Covid-19 fuckery and I had so much time alone. All I could do was go to the gym and sit in my small apartment. I spent all my time on this game and it was a way for me to process my grief. When Arthur died, things really came to a head for me in real life and that caused me to reach out to my other friends that were grieving and start the healing process.

Immersive landscapes bathed in stunning graphics welcome players into the world of Red Dead Redemption, where every blade of grass whispers tales of epic adventure. The combat mechanics, finely tuned and satisfying, offer players a dynamic engagement that keeps them on their toes.

However, beneath this visual splendor lies a narrative that, for some, may struggle to captivate. The story, akin to a slow-burning flame, meanders along, occasionally losing its grip on the player's attention. Its pacing, regrettably, tends to drag, leaving some yearning for a swifter tempo.

One of the game's glaring missteps lies in its travel mechanics. Mounted on horseback, players find themselves traversing vast distances to reach their objectives. While the landscapes beg to be explored, the elongated travel times can test the patience of even the most dedicated adventurers. Unlike its counterparts, the game lacks the option to expedite these journeys, leaving players stranded in a cycle of endless riding. Furthermore, the fast travel system, though present, feels burdened by excessive loading screens, detracting from the seamless immersion the game strives to achieve.

In conclusion, while Red Dead Redemption boasts breathtaking visuals and engaging combat, its narrative pacing and cumbersome travel mechanics may hinder the overall experience for some players. Aspiring adventurers should prepare themselves for a journey that, though rife with beauty and excitement, occasionally stumbles along the path to greatness.",1707791611,1707791611,False,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

The story is top, I loved the gameplay as well - you travel a lot across beautiful country, so be ready for that. But when it finally comes to sooting it feels great as well. 
9,5/10 for me. The only thing I can say I did not enjoy is few parts of the side content.  But those are really small and few and far between. (for example having to get only perfect skins to upgrade your camp)
Thanks Rockstar, this was not just a game. This was an amazing experience. Hope I get to play more games like this, gonna try the first one on my girlfriend's PS, but I'm terrible with controller. Wish me luck!

This is probably the most emotionally-invested I've ever been in a game. It's almost like a 2nd-life within the Wild Wild West. There's an interaction with almost everything and everyone. Great story and gorgeous scenery. I also really liked that in-game wealth DID NOT automatically make the game super easy.

My biggest complaint is the random game crashes--ERR GFX State and Directx12 errors. I've got the latest drivers and this is a relatively old game. Not sure why the crashes keep occurring. It's especially annoying when you're near the end of a mission/cutscene and you have the restart it ALL OVER AGAIN.

I don't know who had this rather witless idea that Arthur Morgan should get and die from Tuberculosis. That makes absolutely no sense at all. First of all you can't get TB just from someone coughing in your face once. Less so being outside! You can even kiss someone with TB without getting it. You have to be exposed to it for a fairly long time. And if you really got TB back then it wasn't a death sentence. A lot of people had it for many years leading a more or less normal life. There was no cure, but hospitals, doctors and sanatoria specialized in TB and meds to treat the symptoms. People with TB also didn't die after just a short period of time being 36 years old like Arthur. There are so many illnesses and other ways for an outlaw to die, why in the world would you choose TB? Something that is less contagious than the common flu! 
I love this game! But I personally didn't feel very motivated to continue playing when I realized when/ why he's going to die. I started to feel sorry for Arthur and instead of going on adventures, doing side quest or buying things in game, I felt like Arthur needs to have a break constantly. And then - already knowing that Arthur's going to die in a few minutes after suffering and looking like a sack of raccoons for the whole last chapter  - why does his horse have to die, too? What did the poor horse ever do to you? 
Too much drama. Even for an outlaw. 
And then! Why would I want to continue playing the game as John Marston being surrounded by his boring wife and annoying son. Even Marston couldn't stand them for the longest time, why would I?",1707764670,1707765044,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Added a hopeful hour to the game, and with it 3 extra hard cut-scene no-load crashes.

I wanted to like it, but I have to spend my playtime on games that are good right out of the gate, and this one just isn't.  With all the options out there, I'll take the one that isn't boring dialogue and fetch quests.  Having a story is great, but that doesn't make it a game.

The world they've created is incredible. You can explore vast landscapes, bustling towns, and everything in between. It feels so real, like you're actually there.

The story is what really hooked me. You play as Arthur Morgan, a tough guy with a heart of gold, on a journey to find redemption. Along the way, you meet a bunch of interesting characters, each with their own stories to tell.

The gameplay is a blast. Whether you're getting into gunfights, riding your horse through the countryside, or just chilling out by a campfire, there's always something fun to do.

What I love most is how alive the world feels. You can hunt animals, chat with strangers, and just soak in the atmosphere. It's like being in your own Western movie.

And if you're into playing with friends, there's Red Dead Online. It's like the single-player game, but you can team up with pals for adventures in the Wild West.

All in all, Red Dead Redemption 2 is an amazing game. It's got great characters, a gripping story, and endless fun. If you want to experience the Wild West like never before, this game is a must-play!",1707638504,1707639529,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

To be honest, this game is a total masterpiece. It's story provided me with so much fun throughout the free-roam and the story is incredible. It shocks me of how this doesn't have billions of good reviews. This game is so incredibly crafted and detailed, it is insane. On your guns you can customize everything and there is a decent crafting system.

What is the story like?
A prequel to the previous game in the saga, follows an unheard of character known as Arthur Morgan in his crew, led by Dutch Van Der Linde, on the run from the law after a shooting down in the quiet town of Blackwater, Arthur and his crew go on several heists, killings, journeys, and more crazy adventures. Arthur does many tasks for his gang before getting TB collecting debt from a sick man on a farm, eventually causing his death. After, you play as another member of the crew, John Marston, and wrap up the story killing Micah, the gangs rat.

Details?
Best I have ever seen. Water levels in barrels are actually a thing, so if you shoot above your last shot on a barrel water wont leak out. Guns have tons of customization, characters have routines, wildlife is realistic and mourns deaths of their packs, you can preform high detailed train robberies, your horse has incredible detail too! I mean, the horses balls even shrink in the cold. And that's not even close to all.

For kids?
No, unless they are mature enough to handle extreme and sexual topics. This game can get very gory and brutal, and there are multiple explicit scenes that kids shouldn't view. Definitely worse than GTA 5, however this game, you don't actually partake in any sexual acts, but the violence is worse.

I would 100% say you should buy this game. This game is so good I would buy it again. Hours of entertainment and tears to be shed. This game is worth an entire gaming console just to play it.

My only issue with this game is the online mode is tedious and boring, as there really isn't much fun to be had when your playing alone. Plus the microtransactions in online just isn't worth it at all. GTA 5's purchases are a little more worth it but I would put it simply as this: Don't waste too much time with online.

Most people complain over the rockstar games launcher too, and crashes, which I havent ever had a problem with, soo... 

So, what do I think in the end?

Online: Worth for some people, or if you have friends.
Story: Totally worth!",1677047323,1707628822,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Absolutely phenomenal game. They really are the ""Rockstar"" of video games. Bruh, this ain't AAA, this is quadruple A game right here lol. This is the best modern video game made even in 2024, other games don't even come close to this one and I feel bad for the shmucks who have not played RDR2.

Dude, the snow felt so real in this game, that when it snowed irl I got nostalgia of this game. And I USUALLY HATE WHEN IT SNOWS IRL. makes you feel like you should suck it up because our ancestors had it way rougher travelling in these harsh weathers. I also really love how interactive the dialogue is. You really feel like you're talking to characters cuz they don't say random dialogue that doesn't belong there, you know what I mean? This game wins in both the story aspect and the gameplay aspect! The only thing I didn't like and I wish the game had was the ability to fast travel properly.

I had thought Metal Gear Solid V: Phantom Pain was one of the best if not the best modern next-gen games I've played until I played this game.

Rockstar Games Launcher is kinda dumb though, if you try to run this game offline it works but eventually it stops working and you have to go online again (connected to internet) to be able to play the game. You would get a message like ""Activation error"". I don't know what the agenda is with game companies making it a requirement to be online to play even their single-player games. they wanna spy on us??? yeah, it's wack.

Another issue is the game is not so optimized to work with the Steam overlay (Shift+Tab). In the settings, if the graphics API is set to Vulkan, which is what it's set to by default, and you enable the steam overlay, you will get stuck lol. your steam overlay will be on your screen and you won't be able to get it off. But yeah. there's no way, at least I don't know any way to get out of it without restarting your game. You could try setting the Graphics API setting to > Direct x12 but that just makes the game crash more. because now there's another issue; on DX12 setting you can get the ""out of memory"" error on game startup. meaning game will crash. very annoying issue. I just never choose this setting ever. I stick to Vulkan and long as I don't bring up the Steam overlay, it's gucci.

Also wish they added a Quicksave command like Bethesda games have. Would really help on the path to attaining 100% completion since it is a HUGE game and you need to save often. the menu UI is slow. everything about this game is slow lol. it takes a while to get into the menu, save the game and then get out of it. A quicksave feature would've solved that problem.",1638134322,1707618068,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

The missions ranged from okay to decently fun. The characters were likable and the dialogue was great. During chapter 2 and throughout a bit of chapter 3 I started to feel bored though. The story didn't feel like it was moving much, the gameplay was beginning to get a bit generic.

I took a break and came back, expecting this to be how I felt about GTA V's singleplayer. Overrated, but decent. I was wrong. The game really opened up for me midway through chapter 3 and into chapter 4. The story began to become a lot more compelling, rare for games these days. The missions became more challenging, I often found that I had to be a lot more careful and began to use consumables instead of just being able to blindly rush through with no danger to myself.

I was amazed with the details they put into the game. Characters would react to your hair length, if you were clean shaven, if you left camp for long periods. Subtle details would be changed in cutscenes or Dead Eye (bullet time) and Arthur's dialogue with others if you were at high or low honor (the moral system of the game). The game also has a lot of detailed side content and encounters, some of which you do have to go out of you way to find, but I find it incredible that they even bothered with some of the things they added, even small things like little pieces of dialogue that many people would not bother to listen to on their way to the next activity. 

The side content isn't forced, but it is fun to do. I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to grind every single legendary animal or grind money or whatever. I would do these things on occasion just to take a bit of a break from the main story. I got 63 hours out of it and I still had a fair amount of side encounters to see, animals to skin, but I did complete all side missions. If you don't like doing side stuff, I can see you getting about 30 hours out of it. That's just my estimate.

The story, hands down is the best I've seen in a game. If you already watched a playthrough or know the story, then I sadly am unsure if I would recommend the game to you. The story, for me, was the game. The story made me play the game for 5-6 hour sessions once I really got into it, which is rare because I normally can only go for 1-2 hour sessions. I wish I could erase my memory of the game and do it all again.

The game can be slow, the game IS slow, you are riding around on a horse in a vast land after all. If you want constant action, you're not gonna get it here.

That being said, this game did not deserve the Labor of Love reward. Red Dead Online has not received any updates for years. The people who voted this game Labor of Love have reading comprehension problems. It is a tragedy that this piece was abaondoned. There is a lot of wasted potential. But we did get something truly special with the singleplayer. It goes on sale for $20, and you're getting your money's worth with it.",1707617856,1707617856,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You can see incredible work on both the graphics and environmental interactions. A great commitment to realism and the rendering of the characters on video. All this wasted in a game that has one of the worst missions ever. An almost total absence of a soundtrack which certainly doesn't help overcome the boredom of doing what seems like the hundredth quest like the previous ones.
I won't dwell on the strange physics of the game, especially with the carriages. It can also be fun and a breath of fresh air compared to the extreme boredom you have to endure.
The icing on the cake is that the story starts to get interesting between the fifth and sixth chapters and then the game ends. This leads you to think that the team knew very well how to make interesting missions and seriously develop characters, but they simply didn't give a damn for the rest of the game.

Red Dead Redemption 2, developed by Rockstar Games, stands as a testament to the studio's commitment to crafting immersive narratives and visually stunning open-world environments. Released in 2018, the game received widespread acclaim for its rich storytelling, attention to detail, and breathtaking visuals. However, while the narrative and visuals deserve accolades, significant flaws in gameplay, character movement, world design, and mission execution ultimately hinder the overall gaming experience.

Story and Visuals (10/10):
Let's start with the positives. Red Dead Redemption 2 boasts an unparalleled narrative experience that rivals some of the best in the gaming industry. Set against the backdrop of the American Wild West, the game follows the exploits of Arthur Morgan, a member of the Van der Linde gang. The storytelling is masterfully executed, with well-developed characters, morally complex choices, and unexpected twists that keep players emotionally invested throughout.

Visually, Red Dead Redemption 2 is nothing short of breathtaking. The attention to detail in the game world is staggering, from the vast landscapes to the minutiae of everyday life. The lighting effects, weather dynamics, and character animations contribute to an immersive and visually stunning experience that sets a new standard for open-world games.

Gameplay Woes (4/10):
Despite its narrative and visual achievements, Red Dead Redemption 2 falters when it comes to gameplay. The controls feel clunky and unresponsive, especially during tense moments. The slow-paced movement of Arthur Morgan becomes a significant hindrance, making traversal feel like a tedious chore rather than an enjoyable aspect of exploration.

Combat mechanics, while realistic, lack the fluidity found in other action-adventure games. Gunfights can become frustrating due to the cover system's inconsistency and the sluggish aiming controls. The realism Rockstar aimed for often translates into a lack of responsiveness, causing player immersion to give way to frustration.

Empty World Design (5/10):
The vast open world of Red Dead Redemption 2, while visually stunning, is marred by its emptiness. While the wilderness and towns are meticulously crafted, the lack of meaningful activities in between makes exploration feel tedious. The world lacks the dynamic interactions and vibrant ecosystems seen in other open-world titles, leaving players yearning for more engaging encounters beyond the occasional wildlife sighting.

Lack of Fun in Missions (5/10):
The missions, a critical component of any narrative-driven game, suffer from a lack of variety and excitement. Many missions feel formulaic, involving a combination of riding to a location, engaging in a shootout, and riding back. The pacing can be slow and monotonous, with too much emphasis on realism at the expense of player enjoyment. The absence of compelling side quests or diversions further contributes to a sense of repetitiveness.

Conclusion (5/10 with Story):
In conclusion, Red Dead Redemption 2 is a game of stark contrasts. Its unparalleled storytelling and jaw-dropping visuals elevate it to the status of a cinematic masterpiece. However, the gameplay shortcomings, slow movement, empty world, and lack of mission variety prevent it from achieving gaming perfection. A rating of 5/10 seems fitting, with the caveat that those who value a captivating narrative and breathtaking visuals may find the overall experience to be worthwhile, despite the frustrating gameplay elements",1643584397,1707587488,False,0,0,0.518664002418518066,0,True,False,False

Arthur Morgan is on my top fictional characters of all time. I've felt joy, happiness, epicness, humbleness, rage but most of all an unending astronomical sadness for him. This is indeed a story about a man redeeming himself (if it's the high honour ending, but it's unanimously agreed that high honour is the canon ending), we start out a bad and unforgiving man, but once we start to realise our time is coming to an end, we change things around, and steer the pot for the best ending to a video game I have ever seen.
The story is a creation of gods, that's all you need to know.
In terms of graphics, this is prettier than 99% of games I played, and the amount of detail put into this is never ending. Each day I find something new I didn't know about.
There is no need to hesitate on buying this game, I got it in a discount at 17€, but man this would probably be the only game I'd pay 60€ for.
I have learned so many life lessons from this, also cried enough rivers to leave me with enough water for 5 years, and still after playing the game and seeing the ending 500 times, I still cry in every rewatch.

The first mistake i make today is that i uprgraded my vram into 2gb with amd driver. So it was 2gb vram and remain at 14 gb ram. I also ran msi afterburner, but unfortunately rdr2 only runs at around 6-10 fps which obviously unplayable. I noticed that the gpu temperature is only around 50, much lower than what i would have expect. After then, i tried to reset the settings into default, with only 512mb Vram and 16 gb ram. 

When i tried to open the rdr2 again with 1600x900 resolution and everything at lowest as possible, I get a steady fps around 30. The lowest would be 24 and the highest would be around 40. Most of the time will be stabilize around 27-33. (I can enjoy it without barely lagging ( I plugged the charger too)

This game is very enjoyable since im a ""newbie pc game player"", even though my device is at the entry level, The experience still enjoyable

This ain't just any shoot 'em up; it's a tapestry woven with rich characters, stunning visuals, and a world teeming with life. Let me tell you why it's worth moseying on over:

[b]A Story Deeper Than A Canyon:[/b] As Arthur Morgan, an outlaw with a conscience, you'll ride alongside the notorious Van der Linde gang. But hold your horses! This ain't your typical black-and-white story. Red Dead Redemption 2 throws you headfirst into a moral tug-of-war, blurring the lines between good and bad, making you question everything you thought you knew about the Wild West. Buckle up for unexpected twists, gut-wrenching moments, and a climax that'll leave you saying, ""Whoa, Nelly!""

[b]A World Alive with Every Detail:[/b] From the sun-drenched plains to the bustling saloons, Rockstar Games has crafted a living, breathing world that'll leave you speechless. Watch dust devils dance across the desert, spot deer grazing in meadows, and listen to the wind whistling through canyons. Even the smallest details, like mud caking on your boots or the clinking of spurs, add to the immersion. It's like stepping right into a dusty old Western film!

[b]More Than Just Shootouts:[/b] Sure, there's shootin' aplenty, but that's just the tip of the iceberg. Red Dead Redemption 2 lets you be a cowboy your own way. Want to be a gunslinger? Go for it! Prefer huntin' for pelts and trappin'? No problem! You can even become a gambler, a fisherman, or just ride around soaking up the scenery. The world is your oyster (or should I say, clam?).

This is my second playthrough. 

Wold design ---------------------------10/10
Music ----------------------------------10/10
Story ----------------------------------- 4/10
Progression and unlocks---------------  4/10
Gameplay------------------------------  3/10

World design is the strongest part of the game. Amazing views, effects, architecture, etc.
Music feels like it was composed by Morricone.
The story becomes boring after Saint Denis. 
The fact that you follow Dutch after so many bad choices, repetitive events and the same formula throughout the whole game is just bad. There is no rewarding turn of events, you just get tuberculosis and start dying while the game keeps the downfall of the main story so... yeah, that culminates on a very anticlimactic ending.
Controls are terrible, clunky and unresponsive. I died and facepalmed a lot of times because of this. 
Combat is also affected by the weird controls of your character, and it came to a point where I got overwhelmed by it. Instead of focusing on flanking or performing some fancy moves to engage the enemy, I just opted to attack on a somewhat conservative and cautious manner.
That combined with the not so compelling weapons unlocking and progression; the fact that many times you need to hit multiple times to neutralize an enemy, even with late game weapons and the overall unpredictability of the controls,  made combat kind of boring and frustrating. 
The speed limitations in specific areas, like camps, stores and random places are very frustrating and unnecessary.
The fact that the game restricts fast traveling a lot is another thing that prevents me from recommending it. A lot of times you ride to a very distant location to complete a mission, and after that you just end up in the middle of nowhere having to ride back to civilization. Even with auto ride it´s kind of annoying, they could have given you the option to go back like in some missions. 

So, would I recommend it? 
Well, this is a hard one for me. 
I think that despite all of it´s deep and game breaking flaws, this is a must play.",1707536826,1707572070,True,0,1,0.47413790225982666,0,True,False,False

But they are killing Read Dead Online right now. The newest gold nerf, which makes it super hard to get gold is just the gravestone for me. With daily challenges (which used to be the best method you can get gold) you only can get 2,2 gold in your first week. A revolver SKIN costs 21 gold...thats all you need to know. 

New players, stay away from online until they fixed this shit, it's just not worth it. They want to get you to buy gold with absolute every method they can.

I am going on 40 years old, have witnessed the dawn of the home video game age from the glory days of bits and box tvs, have played every single genre there could possibly be, my steam account has a 5 digit friend code; and all this to emphasize just how LONG I've been around the video game era. Even through all that, and all the times I've changed my mind about what I thought would be the greatest game of all time: in 2024 I can whole-heartedly endorse Red Dead 2 as being one of the greatest games of all time.

Arthur Morgan is the friend we all wish we had. The guy who will ride with you to the very end. A little fuzzy around the edge of his character, but at the end of the day he is passionate about those he cares for the most, and in the end that's all that you could ever want out of a friend. His connection with his horse is the same as any boy with his machine today. The sheer number of things there is to do in this game outside of the main story is also mind boggling. Rockstar spent so much time working on this game and it shows in so many ways it's hard to describe it to be fair. Half the time you stumble upon something you weren't looking for, but you're glad you did. The gunplay is satisfying, the voice acting is Hollywood worthy, the graphics in 4k (if you can afford to have it run smoothly) is a sight to behold.

You would be doing yourself a huge disservice by looking over this game, and I cannot express that any more sincerely. I hope that this review will help convince someone to go on this journey as well so they too can witness a master class in what a video game could be.",1707537933,1707537933,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's not just a game; it's a journey through the wild west that feels so real, you'll forget you're sitting at your computer. The world Rockstar has created is absolutely stunning, from the towering mountains to the bustling towns, every inch feels alive and full of adventure.

But what really sets this game apart is its characters and story. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll feel like you're right there beside Arthur Morgan and the gang as they navigate through the trials and tribulations of life on the frontier. The attention to detail is mind-blowing, whether it's the way the sunlight filters through the trees or the subtle changes in your horse's behavior, it all adds up to create an experience that's truly immersive.

And let's not forget about the gameplay. Whether you're robbing a train, hunting for game, or just sitting around the campfire telling stories, there's never a dull moment in Red Dead Redemption 2. It's the kind of game that you can get lost in for hours on end, and every time you play, you'll discover something new.

In short, Red Dead Redemption 2 is a masterpiece. It's a game that reminds you why you fell in love with gaming in the first place, and it's an experience that will stay with you long after you've put down the controller.

This game is amazing. High quality story content with good humor and great story telling just like always expected from Rockstar games. 

There is so much to do in this game you will lose your self mounting your (highly annoying) horse in the beautiful atmosphere.  Playing this with a 21:9 monitor was a blast and i am very happy for doing that, tho by having a higher 1440p resolution my PC was really sweating.  I have always had 30+ FPS so it didn't bother me much, tho i am used to play 144+ FPS... but oh well. a sacrifice to play on ultra settings ^^

I did have a few bugs here and there nothing major. But the horse...... oh boy don't get me started...... it is the only reason i was glad i finished my 100% run not having to ride him/her again xD

I did not touch the online mode, nor have any interest in doing so. I do hear that it is not that good. Full of hackers etc. It is nothing new. Same as GTA5 i guess ^^. 

If you get this get it for the story, for the HUGE and beautiful open world with plenty of activities, for a protagonist that you will really like (no spoilers) and If you have a lot of time to spend going from A to B with a some what slowish horse which  won't bother you than this game is for you.

I highly enjoyed and recommend this game.

The story is written so well and had me hooked, while there were sections I wasn't too fond of for the most part it was back to back entertaining. The characters are possibly some of the best in gaming when it comes to both writing and voice acting as it blew me away every time. 

The Setting of the Old West is fully realised in this game with each area being loaded with so much character and detail that makes the world that much more immersive. From the city of Saint Denis to the likes of Valentine, this game offers no shortage when it comes to locations that players can discover. 

Visually, it's still one of the best looking games that gaming as a whole has ever seen. However performance was not the greatest (especially in Guarma) as my PC would constantly crash due to my game being in either Vulkan or Direct X 12. It was especially hell due to it happening all the time in Guarma which i think is one of the weaker if not the weakest chapter in this game. Asides from that I didn't run into any bugs or glitches and when the game didn't crash on me, it ran really smooth. Art Direction is on point capturing the essence of the late 1800s and giving each area of the map its own feel while keeping the same tone throughout. 

Sound and Audio are just perfect with the soundtrack complimenting the game in its fantastic and unique way and the Audio matches every thing to a T. 

In terms of Gameplay, there is a lot to unpack. I would like to say that I really appreciate the detail that Rockstar have put into the realism, however i think it can work against the game as it becomes really tedious skinning the same animal or picking up each individual item laying around. I get that its to show off the realism but it can halt the experience and make it into a more annoying task. I think that combat is fine. While I do really enjoy using the Dead Eye system, the gun play is the same as what we got with GTA V except for a little more realistic movement with it. It works completely fine but I do with that Rockstar really changed it up or made it more interesting than what they had given us about 10 ish years ago. Asides from that, I really love the missions as each of them have pretty cool set pieces and keep the pace going. I really love the random encounters you can find in the world by simply wandering and discovering new people and can offer some of the best moments of this game. Finally, I really like the customisation that you can have with your character whether that be with your horse or your clothes or even the weapons that you carry. 

Overall, Red Dead Redemption 2 impressed me with a fantastic narrative that i could never get enough of. While i may had some nit picks with the gameplay and the performance wasn't the greatest at times, its such an unforgettable experience that will make you want more.",1707445640,1707445640,True,1,0,0.511201620101928711,0,True,False,False

I will admit, the start was quite slow, but that didn't last too long. After the start, it was like I was dragged into the story, like I could feel everything that was happening in real life. The cinamatics were awesome, the story was really good and put so well together.

I even experience displeasure sometimes because after playing Red Dead Redemption 2, any other game just hasn't felt the same playing anymore. It's like reaching the very top of the hill, and everything else is downhill. It's more than a game; it's an unforgettable journey that set a new standard.

The asking price is absurdly high, the game isn't worked on by the company for a long time now but somehow still won an award for ""labor of love"" recently-which raises the issue of lack of integrity for the steam awards as well as reviews. Even the fans complain about hackers, but the community in general is just very toxic-I never though a fresh start in rust could seem friendly compared to something.

When you put in the time to explore and enjoy the game instead of rushing through the missions, you'll find that this is one of the most detailed and vibrant worlds to interact with. An example I will use was when I was ""Wanted: Dead or Alive"" in Lemoyne territory and was riding my horse through the swampy bayou only to come up on checkpoint set up by the lawmen in the game. They were stopping carriages and horses alike to find me, only for myself to escape by using a side road that goes past them.

The only tip that I can give you, if you are new to this game, is to take your time and explore - as well as start the treasure hunting side missions early to give yourself a big leg up on not only your own equipment but the equipment that is at your camp that can be upgraded by the funds you bring in.

The story is absolutely amazing. It's well written and the voice acting to go along with those lines, are very well spoken and make the world of red dead 2 feel more real. It felt like the devs cared. I'm really impressed with what the writers have made together.

I know graphics will get better than this some day but for this game and it's art, it's world, it's absolutely stunning. Also, the amount of detail in the game is mind blowing. For example, I went into the water with my horse and only went in a certain amount a bit above my horses butt and there was a difference in colour for the horse and my legs being wet and above it being dry. There's a lot of nice little touches that amount to a lot for the entire experience.

The music is really good and fits the world. There are certain points in the game where you'll hear a song and honestly, to play the game and hear a song that is meant for a scene, like this is how the devs wanted it, is so nice. 

The gameplay is really easy and is just fun. It's repetitive but fun. You have a lot of tools at your disposal so it can never actually get too hard but the game does get difficult.

I ran this game on my really slim laptop that is several years old and has a nvidia 970m with 4 gb of vm, 16 gb ram. The game gave me ultra and high settings. The game ran amazingly well. I did not expect the game to even run to be quite honest but it did and went beyond my expectations. I would recommend getting a graphics card that is around 970 to play this game.

Honestly, the world of red dead 2 looks absolutely beautiful and seeing a deer in fog in the forest with the shadows and light is so amazing. Watching it run off cause I got too close. And I know I said this before but the amount of detail in the game is too much with the things that you can find. You need to experience it yourself.

There were a couple times that the game got buggy but for an open world game like this with the amount of detail that I was talking about before is understandable. I beat the game and there wasn't anything that ruined the experience. Maybe like twice I had to turn off the game and open it again because things got a little buggy. One other problem that I had is that you cannot play the game offline. Being forced to play a single player game online is horrible...

Anyways, a game like this doesn't come around often and I wasn't even sure if I was going to like a cowboy game but it was worth it. This is a must play. It's been over a decade since I've played rockstar games and if they continue to make red dead games with these writers then they have my money.",1577577268,1707292516,True,2,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2915561463

[b] What is Red Dead Redemption? [/b]

Rdr2 is a open world (story or online) game. In the story mode you play as a interesting man called Arthur Morgan and you go around trying to help your gang while meeting new friends on the way and adventuring through the gorgeous open world. There is plenty of things you can do whether it is through the story mode or the online mode. Online is a little different then the story however, and you can meet other players in the game and talk to them through the open mic feature. There are many different types of enemies in the game (in online that can be other players). There is bounty hunting, horse taming, stealing, animal hunting and much more within this rich story line. This game is also based in 1899 if I remember correctly, so, no telephones have even been invented yet. 

[b] Initial Thoughts: [/b]

-""What a beautiful open world, wheres my horse I want my horse.""
-""Can I kill this lady? WHOOPS, OH GOD, RUNN""
-""OH GOD OH NO WHY ME WHYY""

[b] Beginner Player Friendly?  [/b]

This game seems pretty beginner player ready, though online is not as friendly and a lot of murder does happen. The only thing is I never really understood the controls to well, they can be a bit confusing at first and you may need to check your keyboard or controller binds. Yes this game is controller compatible so that is always a nice addition to this game as well. There is a map that helps you navigate your way though if you want, you can just wing it and figure it out on the way.

[b] Game Play: [/b]

Once you get the hang of the controls you can kind of understand whats happening and how to work the game. There is loads of character customization and you can continue to edit your character throughout the game. In story mode though you cannot edit the character himself, you can only pick and choose what clothes you decide to wear on the character. This game has the option to have either a first person or third person view of your character, I favour the third person view a lot more then the first person because the first person view gives me motion sickness. They have many different features you can unlock throughout the game's story and you do the objectives of whichever NPC in order to get paid and progress further in the game. This goes for both online and the story mode. The story has more content then online does, however online has more player with player and PVP options that make it more interesting. Everyone plays this game differently, and its up to you how you want to make your adventure and what ending you will get. 

[b] Graphics: [/b]

This games graphics are absolutely gorgeous, though as of recently I have been noticing that a lot of them have been broken. My map, horse textures and skin textures have all been breaking. Which is probably because Rockstar has been working on other games as of recently. But I did notice a patch update so I hope that helps fix some of the problems. This game has some of the most realistic graphics and world textures I have ever seen, and it makes me appreciate them a lot even though sometimes they break. For some people I would recommend turning down the graphics as they can be super heavy on your gaming device. Sometimes my computer breaths like a air turbine even though I try to keep my graphics on medium. Thankfully my computer still doesn't lag and doesn't get too hot. There have been games that have pushed my PC further then this. 

[b] Community: [/b]

The community is a mic of, crazy people, role players, bounty hunters and toxic players. After a certain level however I have noticed that they aren't as intense. Some of the toxic players (which are not as common as they are in say, CSGO) do make very inappropriate and some times too far jokes. However the large majority of the community are pretty hilarious and I have met some absolutely AMAZING people on here. Some in which are going to read this review and tell me how cringe I am. The other people you have to look out for on this game are the modders, some are awesome. I am friends with some of them! As for others... They are extremely toxic and irritable. Though usually if you switch servers when you see flaming horse feet, you are pretty okay to avoid them all together. But again, the large majority of them are amazing people and are willing to help you out if you need and offer you some good laughs. 

[b] How long can you play? [/b]

The game's playability depends on how much you like it. I am only 5 hours into the story mode and I am still at the beginning of it, so if you are here for the story it is 1000% worth it and you can play it for hours on end. As for online, if you are only there for the content and not for the players then you will be able to have quite a while to play and sometimes it can be a bit slow paced. But if you are there to play with other people, you will end up like me and have quite a bit of time in the game because you want to hang out with your friends and be absolutely psychotic.

[b] My Opinion: [/b]

Overall I recommend this game if you enjoy story games (for the single player story mode option) or if you really enjoy hanging out with your friends and being forces of nature. I would also say if you enjoy just strolling around a beautiful world on horse back, this could be an enjoyable game for you.

It arguably has one of the best and most engaging stories of any game ever. I have only been playing it on the steam deck. any time that I want to play a game where I am not at my desk and with my PC this on my steam deck is the go to, no questions asked. Graphics are beautiful. Story and emotion is plentiful. There are so few things I can physically fault it on it. There are fun and interesting, and importantly, a variety of different missions and side missions to complete. There always new things to discover and a range of different ways to play. The attention to detail is mind boggling and shows how a game should really be made. 

My only issue, price. £59.99 is too steep, even if it is arguably the best game ever made. It makes it less accessible to everyone. I feel £49.99 may be justifiable, but pushing be too much still.

 I beat this game in its entirety on my ps4 not knowing much about the game and I must say it was a great experience, one of the only games I wasn't spoiled too. 
Arthur is also one of the greatest protagonist I have ever seen, I of course played only high honor with him and did all of the side missions first to show how good Arthur is, and boy did the ending hit hard.
After playing I felt hollow, like I just experienced peak fiction and now its over...
I bought the game on my pc as well to play around with mods and to be a bad person (Because I enjoy doing that in games) but afterword's I'll probably play again as good Arthur because its what he deserves.

What is the point of the autosave feature if it saves as soon as you die? Another frustrating this is boats, what is the point of them? You can move through the water, and fish off of them which is great, but when you catch a fish you cant store it on the boat properly... It makes no sense and makes the boats so useless.

It's one of those cases where you actually start caring about the issues more, because they ruin an otherwise unique experience.

(This review is based on Story mode btw. I'm about ~70 hours in, still in Chapter 4, but have been meaning to write a review on this, especially after the torture the game subjected me to :D I have not played online mode at all.)

I'll try to not be overly negative though and give credit where credit is due... 
First off, Steam only gives me 2 choices... ""recommend"" or ""not recommend"" so it's putting me in a really difficult spot here.. while I was tempted to give this a thumbs down, I can't in good faith do so, because of the positives the game offers.

The real recommendation would be somewhere smack in the middle... or more like a ""recommend with some caveats"" because of the nature of the game having this overwhelming focus on immersion - which is awesome btw - the ridiculous amount of frustration this game can cause is beyond anything in similar games ever.. 
I would legit give this game the ""Most frustrating game"" award... at least in this type of genre.

[h3] The good: [/h3]
- the game engine is absolutely amazing and not only does it facilitate all of the features below, it also produces some of the best stock video game graphics I've seen and does so in a fairly performance friendly manner without any noticeable thread bottlenecks and the likes.
- It's probably the most immersive game ever made in this open-world category.. to the point where literally.. your character's hair and beard grows as time passes... 
- the world genuinely feels alive.. which is a pretty big one. Random encounters are seamlessly integrated, the forest isn't just a big empty collection of trees like in all other games... you have generic wildlife from toads to snakes, raccoons, rabbits, elks, deer, moose, wolves, cougars, panthers etc. etc.. basically you cannot take more than a couple of steps in the forests and fields without having some form of wildlife around you - all of which you can also hunt
- Pretty immersive hunting system.. various animals need to be killed with specific weapons for the best quality pelts and ingredients, otherwise if you have to shoot them multiple times or use the wrong weapons their quality degrades etc.
- While the story isn't something super special (nor does it need to be for a bunch of bandits), the missions are well put together and when the game lets you enjoy them, they're quite nice and very often have a charming comical overtone
- etc. etc... basically it's a really good game... and it would be an even better one if not for the other side of things ruining things.


[h3] The bad: [/h3]
- [b]The game has a horrible save system...[/b] the typical console ""one-slot"" system where it pretty much auto-saves everything as you go into that one auto-save slot. It's also over-eager in saving... basically if ANYTHING bad happened.. you're already screwed cuz it got saved.
I had an incident where I was going to either uninstall the game or restart from scratch... 

(TLDR: I was minding my own business and rode too close to some prisoner transport wagon and accidentally triggered them, making them shoot at me so I shot back, but suddenly became public enemy number one and they chased me to some town where both me and my horse were gunned down by a small army of law-enforcement people. I re-spawned.. and was informed that my ultimate edition bonus horse was dead and the game was already auto-saved at that point. Thankfully some googling told me I could repurchase the horse again, thou it took me several game restarts and the selling of that ""replacement"" horse I got before it re-appeared - so kinda buggy there.) 

You CAN make manual saves (which I discovered later as the game doesn't actually tell you and it's hidden under a menu called ""Story"" so not directly in the main menu as you would expect).
That process is just as annoying and tedious... every single menu screen fades through black for like a full second.. and the save option is like 3 menus deep... 
So to save... you press the menu button... select story... wait for the stupid screen to fade through black... select save game... wait for the animation again... pick a spot... wait again... confirm the overwrite / save.. back out of the save menu.... wait... back out of the story menu... wait.... and finally you can close the menu.. 

- [b]Loading is equally bad... [/b] saving the game doesn't actually save that moment.. it merely saves your ""status"".. when you load back up... the game plops you down somewhere in the vicinity where you were... doing something completely different and any random encounters or anything you were doing are gone... so you can completely forget about trying to explore various outcomes of a situation (which is pretty much a staple move of any RPG so if the clunky systems screw up the story for you, you can sort of try again)..

- [b]Character controls are very hit or miss... [/b] Your character has this ""momentum"" induced passive movement that was introduced in similar games quite a while back.. it makes you feel like you have input lag basically, but it can in certain situations allow for more organic movement.. 
This becomes quite horrible though when you're trying to actually loot items freely placed in the world (which is quite common), you'll find yourself often d*cking around for minutes trying to pick up something or open a drawer, your character simply doesn't want to do what you want.. 

- [b]The game has probably the worst law-enforcement system [/b] I have ever seen in any similar game (which is saying something...). It has all these cool systems like wearing a mask to hide your identity... except all of it is BS when it comes to the lawmen of RDR2... as they seem to possess psychic powers.. 
Brush up against somebody, trying to pass them... you're suddenly a wanted criminal.. and somehow every cop out there knows that it was Arthur freaking Morgan by name... so they'll send everyone after you and hunt you down :D  Ofc they ignore NPCs when YOU get robbed and kill you instead!
You can't even have fun generic fights with law enforcement... even if you murder every last witness... THEY KNOW... and your bounty just keeps going up, which you ofc will have to pay.
There were at least a dozen times where I ended up in massive shootouts with the police when I literally haven't done anything... either I looked at them the wrong way... or passed by them on a street... all of them ended up with me having to just reload a save in ultimate frustration. 
It's just puzzling how this ended up in the released game.. On the one hand you have all these super immersive systems that would be capable of seamlessly integrating proper immersive law enforcement... heck you even have a witness system.. and then on the other side you have this very dumbed down ""police come endlessly until you die or run away with a massive bounty"" that feels like it's running the same logic as some of the early DOS games.. 

- [b] Day / night cycle seems way too fast [/b], you barely wake up and drink your coffee (especially with that unnaturally slow movement speed limit in camp) and by the time you head out, it's getting dark...

- [b] Missions only tell you the challenges AFTER you finished.. [/b] like wtf.. I do the mission and the game is like.. ""oh.. btw you were supposed to do this as a challenge..."" doh..

- [b] They NEVER let you loot... [/b] This is one of the frustrating point too... every time you want to loot the people you killed during a mission... your companions either randomly die.. or the mission fails... or they just constantly yell at you to hurry.

Bottom line, there are too many small frustrating things that ruin immersion or just too many things that can go wrong unintentionally and then you have to deal with the frustrating save / load system on top of it.",1707188929,1707188929,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Short review: This game is a masterpiece in all levels and you have to try it. 

""Long review"": It took me 90 hours to finish this game, mostly because it has so much content and its open world feels so alive that I couldn't help but explore, and I explored as much as I could and I still haven't even cleared most of the map, not only the characters of the story feel alive, even the NPC's feel like they have their own daily life tasks like any real person. 

 The are tons of easter eggs and side missions, same can be said about the amount of events that happen around the game's world, I'm 100% convinced that after nearly 100 hours on this game, I still have not found most of the side events nor world events, because the world is so vast and huge that it takes me some time to get from one point to another, and in between my travels, there's always some side mission or event going on, even easter eggs. 

This game is a damn masterpiece and everyone knows that at this point, the graphics are absolutely amazing, my PC isn't that good but this game still looks amazing on mid-high graphic settings, its optimization is a 10/10 as well. Every point on this game including the story of course, are a masterpiece and you can see through everything and just makes you wonder the amount of hard work the people that were part of the development of this game had to put into this title. 

 The story of this game is fantastic, movie-like, the music gives me chills, the story is quite long but I'm not tired of it at all, even after finishing the story there's still a lot of things to do around, I enjoyed so much playing this game, I even took my time to read the damn books around the camp, they really make you understand characters such as Dutch or Hosea and it gives depth to their stories, and more importantly they motivated me to read a book, this game made me read Roadside Picnic and finish it, and I'm so ever more motivated to read a book a month, I know this sounds dramatic but bear in mind that for some people like me, games like this have a huge impact, including Arthur's journal, this game is just another prove that video games are much more important than we think.

 If you somehow see through this game and beyond its story, you can end up learning something important about Arthur's story and his redemption, you can even learn about some side characters and their stories, even some NPC's and all animals that you hunt, most people including me, don't read that, being honest, there's a lot of animals and I'm not counting the legendary ones, but that's just another proof that video games can also be much more than just mere entertainment, such as books and such as many movies, what a masterpiece, worth the price and worth your time, everyone knows that at this point.

 You definitely need to try RDR1 after finishing this game, its world feels alive even with all the restrictions of the hardware that we had during that era, I still recall watching the trailer of RDR1 when I was a kid, I was blown away by it when I tried it, don't look down on it, great game and a masterpiece too.",1707176958,1707176958,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

They drop one main game every 6 years and people talk about that game for more than a decade and they make more money than anyone else, just from that game. RDR2 is the perfect example of their consistency, because of its amount of details. I can watch a 3-hour long video showcasing the most insignificant details covering all parts of the map and I would be impressed every single time. And now with GTA 6's trailer and budget revealed, I can't even comprehend the technical advantages GTA 6 will have in 2025 considering what RDR2 did in 2018. Every second I spend on RDR2 my GTA 6 expectations grow larger and larger... How will they ever top this masterpiece? 

But... I still strongly believe that I will love RDR2 more than GTA 6, because of its deep story and characters. Every single gang member is so well written on their own with their own back stories and everything, and Arthur Morgan is no doubt the most well-written character in all of the cinema industry perhaps. Looking at GTA 6 I am scared of Rockstar, because they will once again change course of the video game industry, but what the Grand Theft Auto series will never give me is this goddamn hell of a story. This counts RDR1, and hopefully RDR3 in the future. 

For the online part... well... heard of GTA Online? Yeah, sorry but its just like that. Griefers and toxic randoms all over the place.

Obviously, from the hours I spent in game I became completely engrossed in this. I'm a vegetarian and was worried about the animal violence, this was something that did NOT bother me in the game where it normally would. I think it is because the game is so detailed oriented it feels necessary instead of pointless like so many other animal deaths in media. I did cry at multiples points in the story, you spend so much time with these characters, it is hard not to. The protagonist is THE BEST protagonist I've ever played in a video game (maybe tied with Disco Elysium). I played with Xbox controller and Steam Deck, my first game on there! The Deck ran this game beautifully! I would only recommend Deck for small missions and casual playing, however, the story has so many beautiful details you should see on a bigger screen.

The leap from console to PC isn't just a technical upgrade; it's a reinvigoration of an already beloved experience.

First and foremost, the game itself is an undeniable masterpiece. From the sprawling, breathtaking landscapes to the minutiae of life teeming within its ecosystems, RDR2 on PC elevates every aspect of its environment. The diversity of the ecosystems, ranging from snow-capped mountains to dense forests and arid deserts, is more alive and immersive thanks to the enhanced graphics. The world is vibrant, filled with people, animals, and countless random events that make every journey through it feel unique and exciting.

Arthur Morgan, the game's protagonist, is a testament to Rockstar's storytelling prowess. Spending hundreds of hours with Arthur, you come to know him not just as a character in a game, but as a real person you might encounter in real life. The depth of his personality, his struggles, and his growth throughout the story are portrayed with such nuance that it's impossible not to feel a deep connection to him.

The graphical improvements on PC are nothing short of spectacular. The attention to detail is astonishing, from the play of light through the trees to the intricate textures of the world. If you have the hardware to push high FPS, the game transforms into an even more stunning visual feast, significantly surpassing the console versions. The fluidity of motion, combined with the already exceptional art design, makes for an experience that is truly immersive.

While Red Dead Online has its merits, my focus—and recommendation—remains with the single-player campaign. The richness of the story, the depth of the world, and the connection with Arthur Morgan are where the heart of this game lies.

Red Dead Redemption 2 on PC is an exemplary case of how a game can transcend its original platform to deliver an experience that feels both familiar and refreshingly new. Whether you're revisiting the game or stepping into Arthur's boots for the first time, the PC version offers the definitive way to experience one of the greatest stories ever told in video gaming.",1707146878,1707146878,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h3]INTRODUCTION[/h3]
Rockstar Games have always been one of the best studios in the industry when it came to consistently releasing masterfully-crafted open world games, but [i]Red Dead Redemption 2[/i] is their best one to date. Red Dead Redemption 2 is an open world Western epic set during the tail end of the Wild West era, where outlaws and gunslingers were becoming a thing of the past and the modern industrial era had begun. There is a lot to talk about with this game that I feel this review wouldn't even be able to do it justice, be either way, here is my review of Red Dead Redemption 2.

[h3]A VAST & IMMERSIVE OPEN WORLD[/h3]
When I was a young kid, the first game to truly impress me with its open world was [i]The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion[/i]. Exploring a massive open world that not only looked realistic and immersive, but also one that was widely interactable, really blew me away and showed me just what video games could be capable of. Red Dead Redemption 2 is the first open world game I've played since Oblivion where the world is just as visually stunning and immersive as it is extremely detailed. This game is a true technical achievement that, even five years later, still feels leaps ahead of most games released in the current generation. Whether you're climbing to the top of a mountain overlooking the entire map in great detail, or seeing the impressive volumetric lighting cut through the clouds, will never not be a jaw-dropping sight to behold. The world of Red Dead Redemption 2 is so meticulously detailed that it's honestly quite difficult to really narrow it down to just a couple of examples to drive home just how detailed it really is.
Where there is a massive open world, there must also be a wide array of activities to do within that world. Red Dead Redemption 2 is filled with all sorts of activities whether it's hunting animals for food or pelts, playing some Poker and Blackjack, going out robbing stores and trains, or just simply getting lost and discovering the dozens of hidden secrets and easter eggs strewn throughout the world, full of environmental storytelling. Like with previous Rockstar titles, you can also do a wide array of Stranger Missions, each with their own storylines and characters, seperate from the main plot - Some of them wacky and over the top while others are more intimate and personal to Arthur. Whether it's partaking in the game's various activities or experiencing the Stranger Missions, Red Dead Redemption 2 has a lot to see and experience in the world. 

[h3]AN EPIC & ATMOSPHERIC SOUNDTRACK[/h3]
Just like with the first game, the original score for Red Dead Redemption 2 perfectly complements the open world and story missions. Woody Jackson, who also composed the score for the first game as well as [i]Grand Theft Auto V[/i], returns as the composer for Red Dead Redemption 2, with a much greater scope than before. You have your ambient tracks that playing during free roam, music for both Story missions and Stranger missions, and you have music that NPCs will perform such as playing instruments or singing songs around a campfire. The music that plays during Story/Stranger missions is fantastic, with almost every mission in the game having its own distinct score to accompany the action and lead-up to the action. The game's soundtrack also features vocal tracks from artists like D'Angelo, Daniel Lanois, and even Willie Nelson, that play during key moments in the story. With dozens of hours of music to complement the entire experience, Red Dead Redemption 2 has one of the biggest and most expansive soundtracks I've heard. 

[h3]AN UNFORGETTABLE STORY & PROTAGONIST[/h3]
The first Red Dead Redemption had a phenomenal story and an amazing protagonist, but Red Dead Redemption 2 easily tops the first game with what is both my favorite story and protagonist of all time in any piece of media. Arthur Morgan is such a well-written character who is phenomenally played by Roger Clark. Despite the game's title, Red Dead Redemtpion 2 is a prequel to the first game, showcasing the Van der Linde gang in it's final months, as the Wild West comes to an end and the modern world draws near. Even though the game's story depicts those events, the story of Red Dead Redemption 2 is primarily about Arthur Morgan, his journey and his development as a character throughout the story. Whether you choose to go the redemptive, honorbale route or the more dishonorbale one, Arthur Morgan's journey is an emotional and unforgettable one. 

[h3]CONCLUSION[/h3]
It goes without saying that Red Dead Redemption 2 is my favorite game of all time, but even without my own personal opinion, it's hard to deny that this game is a masterfully-crafted experience from beginning to end with an epic and emotional story, as well as being a technical achievement that outdoes even the most recent open world games. Red Dead Redemption 2 is Rockstar Games' masterpiece and is one that I wholeheartedly recommend playing.",1705770787,1707132155,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Great story that has a of heart felt interactions with loveable characters. Arthur Morgan is also one of the best video game characters of all time along side John Marston. They ended the 2 parts of the game beautifully with the epilogue concluding the game in a spectacular fashion leaving the fans satisfied, but also wanting more at the end and also to get them to play red dead 1. I've had my fair share of frustrations with the game when it came 100% it, but it was worth it. The online portion will not be included in this review bc that's a whole another part of the game that I think is to be made in it's own review.

So RDR2 story mode wise is spectacular. The intro was slow but felt needed to bring us some background of our characters and sets up the plot of the whole game. I loved all the gang characters even the side ones like Swanson, Pearson, Karen, Mary Beth, Tilly, Lenny, Uncle, and Hosea and many more. They did a splendid job really giving you time to spend time in this world and interact with gang if you chose to do so. My one complaint would just be the slow animations and menu screens that are delayed as you play the game. It's like super cool and immersive for the first couple of hours, but just starts getting annoying especially when you are trying to 100% the game. Anyways Rockstar did a splendid job with this and also thanks to the talented Roger Clark with his mo capture with Arthur Morgan and Rob Wiethoff with John Marston. It's an unforgettable journey that will pull at your heart strings and even make grown men cry in a video game which is okay. Overall would recommend this to all types of gamers and even if you don't like Western media. This game got me to love western media, and also due to my step dad loving it before he passed recently. This game kinda helped me through a lot and reminds me of him bc he loved westerns and american culture and history. It's a truly rare masterpiece in gaming and hopefully Rockstar does well with their next entry in the series. 10/10 GOAT game",1618590785,1707116699,True,1,0,0.521156013011932373,0,True,False,False

After 220 hours on and off for about 2 years. i have finally finished the story, now onwards to the epilouge

I have stayed at each camp for substantial amount of time to know each member well, they come alive as characters instead of names. Which made the change within the camp become painfully obvious as I continue the story. It is a bittersweet story seeing how the last of the outlaws meet the ever moving pace of technology and civilization and to see how Arthur grow as a person.

I've always thought the idea of a prequel is silly due to the fact I already know how things will end for the characters involved.

Everything from the soundtrack to the smallest environmental details had me engulfed in this already beautiful story.

AS FOR NOW DO NOT BUY RDR 2 ESPECIALLY FOR THE ONLINE PLAY. IT'S DEAD/NO UPDATE CONTENT, NO PLANS/PROMISES FROM DEVS, AND LITTERED WITH CHEATERS. It literally can disconnect you from the server and force close your game/crashes your game.

But most of these time, modders will leave you alone and they're neutral modders. They do their own stuff like blinking or teleporting to their own destination, spawning animals or treasure chests for unsuspicious newbie to take. Sometimes you will encounter troller modder,or bad modder, where they teleport you somewhere, or drop tons of live dangerous animals on you, or simply blow you away to the sky and burn you. These trollers cannot be reported (you will crash to desktop), cannot be severed with (they can follow you even if you jump server). Just try to avoid them, contacting them, or harassing them.

RDR 2 Offline/Story is totally an awesome product. Reviews are below.

RED DEAD REDEMPTION 2 (Offline/Story Review):
Best game so far. Town is detailed, feel alive (each NPC can be interacted with, such as intimidated, say hello, troll them, etc), and packed with stories and characters here and there. You can always find something here and there. You can always make your own decision. Found a fellow in need? You can help them do what they need, or YOU CAN ROB THEM! Beat em to death, do whatever you want! With all the risk and moral penalties or rewards. If you help them, one day they can give you reward (i.e free gun from the store). if you kill someone, one day their wife will come and make a scene, etc.

The world engine/physics are amazing. Drag a crocodile on muddy ground? The muds around the crocodile will be formed accordingly. Running in snow as well. 

What i like
+Attention to detail, world details.
+Beautiful landscapes
+Characters
++Solid gameplay
+Good character movement
+Good combat

What I dislike
-Horse movement can be sluggish on tighter terrains
-Not optimized for lower PC! Very demanding.
-Shooting combat can be a bit hard

Conclusion:
A must have or play game even in normal price. Get the game especially for the single player, but don't hope too much for the online as it has cheater, most of them are neutral if not disturbed/provoked.

Nakey Jakey's video seems to put it best.

Optimization
-didn't have much trouble playing the game. Sometimes has a weird glitch(?) that says it's running out of game memory? Only happened once though so nothing noticable.

Character creation/clothing 
-clothes could do a little better. Bandana could do better by simply adding a few color options. Masks could definitely do better (No Ned Kelly mask? Really?) But outside of wishing for more options there's nothing bad I can really say about it. (Ignoring John's segment because that lack of og hair sucks)

Graphics
-Looks great

Plot
-Great
-Except I question the existence of the honor system and the impact it has on the plot. The whole story seems to be geared towards the 'honorable' ending and gameplay so having the choice of pretending to be not is a bit weird. 

Gameplay
-The auto-animation thing that goes on is just plain annoying. The lack of control that suddenly takes over because the game doesn't want me to be too fast/slow is just simply annoying. Exhibit #1: the horse
-The horse: It's great - until auto-pilot drives me into a rock and throws me off, or I'm suddenly turning left when I'm pressing the w button, or when all my weapons are stowed into saddle and I have to re-arm myself again except the game wants me to use a rifle so one of my repeaters or shotguns are suddenly gone.
-I want to pick up that item next to the shotgun shells. But you can't really choose which items you pick up and you can't pick up the shells either because your inventory's full. Cue five minutes of carefully alligning your screen only to miss it by a few pixels.

-It's the one bad side of the game that's impossible to ignore; the constant inconveniences that keep on happening.
-eating/weight stats should either be easier to see (not pausing the game and using the menu) and should matter much more than it should or it shouldn't exist at all. It also should be much easier to gain weight (or at the very least it should be easier to see how consuming foods and such affect you)

-Open world gameplay is open world gameplay. It's definitely one of the better ones though.


It's great.

but i have played this game so many times, i just don't see the magic anymore. and let me explain why. the missions almost never have choices. and when your given a choice, it rarely impacts the game outside of how that mission ends.

and the honor system for this game is terrible. the honor of an action is only explained after you commit the action. imagine going into a store, but the prices are only seen after you purchase products.

in all of my time playing RDR2 story i have never once completed a high honor play through, simply because of how hard, and not fun it is.

and this game also fails in some other sections. like the NPC's are all the same. same battle tactics, same animations, same weapon accuracy and fire rates. imagine 1 NPC Cloned to fill the role of every NPC. because after all, the NPC's only have different cloths, voice lines, and weapons.

and this is a western game but sadly much of the combat is either getting shot as you reload, or filling someone with lead just to kill them. for a western game, the combat and weapons aren't as good as you'd expect.

the missions in the online usually carry out the same way. and aren't to different from each other, making them not feel special.

and don't get me started with RDR2 online. it's so bad. so many missions just for ever load, or don't actually start, leaving you to run around the open world.

and the online if plagued with hackers. no different than GTA5 hackers. the same old stuff with getting blown up randomly.",1607781710,1707008782,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

“With the depth of gameplay and storyline as well as the overwhelming open world, just one article about Red Dead Redemption 2 is unfair to the game makers at Rockstar.” After 100 hours of playing this game, I completely agree with this statement.

Rockstar game is probably the one most dedicated developer I've ever seen. Almost all of their games make all of us surprised and amazed because how good have they take care their ""childs"" down to the smallest detail. That turns RDR2 into a blockbuster on par with the epic Hollywood movies of Marvel or DC, but instead of going to theaters for 2 hours, players spend more than 60 hours.
The open world of RDR2, meticulously designed by Rockstar, satisfies the elements I want in an open world game. From cities to natural scenes in the game such as forests, mountains, rivers, and swamps are designed perfectly Even each animal has its own characteristics and hunting method.
Gameplay is always the soul, the backbone of an entire game. In RDR2, this is an extremely big ""plus"" for me. Red Dead Remption 2 also has a vibrant ""soul"" with countless different activities. It feels like every person, every character, whether anonymous or having a strong influence on the plot... has its own life, its own journey going on where you can't see it.
All of these elements create a great game ready for gamers to immerse themselves in forever without being able to stop.

If i have to talk about Red Dead Redemption 2, one article will never be enough. This is a masterpiece of masterpieces, worthy of being one of the greatest games in the open world game series.
Finale Rate: 9.5/10

""Avec la profondeur du gameplay et de l'histoire ainsi que le monde ouvert écrasant, un seul article sur Red Dead Redemption 2 est injuste envers les créateurs de jeux chez Rockstar."" Après 100 heures de jeu à ce jeu, je suis entièrement d'accord avec cette affirmation.

Le jeu Rockstar est probablement le développeur le plus dévoué que j'ai jamais vu. Presque tous leurs jeux nous surprennent et nous étonnent tous, car ils prennent soin de leurs ""enfants"" dans les moindres détails. Cela fait de RDR2 un blockbuster comparable aux films épiques hollywoodiens de Marvel ou DC, mais au lieu d'aller au cinéma pendant 2 heures, les joueurs y passent plus de 60 heures.
Le monde ouvert de RDR2, méticuleusement conçu par Rockstar, répond aux éléments que je souhaite dans un jeu en monde ouvert. Des villes aux scènes naturelles du jeu, telles que les forêts, les montagnes, les rivières et les marécages, sont parfaitement conçues. Même chaque animal a ses propres caractéristiques et méthodes de chasse.
Le gameplay est toujours l’âme, l’épine dorsale de tout un jeu. Dans RDR2, c'est un très gros ""plus"" pour moi. Red Dead Remption 2 possède également une « âme » vibrante avec d’innombrables activités différentes. On a l'impression que chaque personne, chaque personnage, qu'il soit anonyme ou qu'il ait une forte influence sur l'intrigue... a sa propre vie, son propre voyage qui se déroule là où on ne peut pas le voir.
Tous ces éléments créent un jeu formidable dans lequel les joueurs peuvent s'immerger pour toujours sans pouvoir s'arrêter.

Si je dois parler de Red Dead Redemption 2, un seul article ne suffira jamais. Il s’agit d’un chef-d’œuvre parmi les chefs-d’œuvre, digne d’être l’un des plus grands jeux de la série de jeux en monde ouvert.
Je donnerai ceci : 9,5/10

I hate it. I wanted to at least finish the story, but that proved to be exceedingly difficult because the game doesn't want to be played, it plays itself. You can't even slightly deviate from the path pre-determined by the mission designers. Any disobedience of the great yellow marker will lead to immediate punishment(failing the mission). You literally can step in the wrong direction or climb the wrong fence and it's game over. On top of that the game always treats you like a complete imbecile. Go here, press that, hold this, follow the checklist, in order, follow this guy, too close, too far, don't run, don't walk, don't use this gun, use this gun, open this, collect this. Half of the time it just straight up takes over. If I had a penny every time the game took control of the character from me, I'd be like $60 more rich now. About the price of this garbage on the store. Ridiculous. On top of that, ""immersion"". This tries SO hard to be immersive. With all those physical stores, and animations of interacting with everything, and actually picking up stuff, and physics, and... everything. Like, clearly, a lot of research and hard work was put into faithfully recreating this wild west fantasy. But what's the point of all that ""immersion"" when it just doesn't work? This illusion they try so hard to build is easily shattered every an NPC decides to have a broken script and starts running around, screaming, because I didn't park the horse correctly or got off it a little earlier than when the game told me to stop. Or every time I have to wrestle with controls! Because we have immersion here, Arthur can't just turn when I tell him to turn, he has to realistically shift his whole body weight from one leg to the other and be sure, it takes a couple seconds, but he'll get there. And with this detailed locomotion system I just walk around the city and slam into an invisible wall/box. Because NPCs were just standing there and when their quest-giving stuff was done, the collision box wan't destroyed. Invisible collision boxes were part of the everyday life in the wild west, you see. And the mission structure too, it's almost always the same: meet a guy in one place, ride with him to the other place, shoot someone, ride back. Why can't we just meet there? Why we always have to shoot? Story is very questionable too. It's this central conflict of Arthur being an enforcer and adopted son to Dutch, who always says ""We just need some money"" or ""One last hit and we're done"". I get it, he's insasne, there'll never be enough, there's always a next last hit. But, look here, I didn't rob anyone outside of mandatory story mission, I didn't seek to make more money, but I have almost $10k in this worn leather satchel Arthur always carries around. Dutch, dude, you think this is not enough to get a fresh start? This is about 365 thousand dollars, adjusted for inflation. You sure that's not enough to get the whole gang to Tahiti or Australia or whatever? Of course not, the game doesn't consider this option. This game is not about options, it's about story and characters, it's a movie with a bit of interaction. 
And I wanted to finish the story, but I just can't, I had enough. Last drop was when I rode, again, from point A to point B, to start another story mission, and a bounty was on the way there. Alright, might as well catch the guy and get the bounty. Oh, he's actually camping with his wife and son? And he's not resisting. And he's like ""I'm a changed man, but give me a moment to say goodbye"". Alright, I'm not a monster, sure. So, he tells his son something and he's like ""Let's go"". I tie him up, start riding away, his wife is crying, his son is alone. I don't feel like bringing him in anymore. Take him off the horse, want to cut him free, but the same button for cutting the rope is the button for punching, for some reason. So when he's free he starts to fight me. Alright, I'm a little ticked off, but no biggie, I reload. Come to the same place, he says his goodbyes again, instead of tying him up... I can't do anything. I can't tell him I don't want to collect him(it's only $25 anyway, drop in a bucket of my ~10k). So I just stand there in silence. And he's like ""let's go, unless you changed your mind"". My man, I did! But I can't do anything! So I decided to just leave the scene slowly, see if he acknowledges it. As I ride away, I still see he's displayed as hostile... then he starts running away. His whole family is running away, from their camp, into the woods, across the river, screaming. I watch this highly immersive spectacle, and suddenly BAM, game over, ""whatshisface has escaped"", go reload a checkpoint. Dummy, bonehead, little baby, so-called free thinker, who do you think you are? Only do the things we tell you to do! 
And that moment, exemplifying most of everything that's wrong with this game, is when I decided I can't stomach any more of this.

Red Dead Redemption 2[/h1]
[u]Single Player Review Only[/u]
This is no doubt one of the best games I have played. The story, gameplay, open world and enormous amounts of things you can do in this game is out of this world.

This game is a straight buy… to some extent.
I will detail most issues in the in depth section, but there are 2 main issues I want to cover here:
1.	Highly Unstable Port: 
Frequent crashing is something I had to deal with and it is very disappointing given that they had a year to fully flesh out the port, and that GTA V had a very solid port.

2.	Mission Replayability:
Gold medals are hell to get as always because half of the time in missions you are just walking around doing fuckall. It is just not fun. Why can’t we have the option to skip these segments so we can get to the fun stuff? Why can’t we just restart the mission instead of having to abandon it, wait for the game to load back to the checkpoint, then load the mission again? Why can’t we complete the objectives over multiple playthroughs like we could in GTA V? This shit is painful.

In short, this game is a masterpiece, albeit with some flaws including the most annoying mission replayability and the highly unstable PC port.

	[td]+ Improved cinematic camera from GTA V, you no longer need to manually maneuver your horse
+ Love that the map gets progressively populated as you explore, gives the sense of progression
- Why do I have to keep manually retrieve my guns from my horse?
- Why the fuck do I lose Honor for killing the bounty hunters’ dogs that are trying to kill me? Are you stupid??
- Missable items and missions
- Economy balancing is not present in the game, there's too little things to buy with all the money you get in the game
- Cover system is broken
- Lacking in numerous QoL features like cooking/eating food en masse or discarding a specific number of an item
- Weight system is a bit of a hit or miss, since you can't eat food en masse to save time, and there is no UI to indicate how close you are to being over or underweight.
- Some legendary animals required that allows you to craft items useful during the story 
 such as prevents animals from decomposing on your horseback locked until you actually finish the main story.
- Who thought it was a good idea that I have to recollect materials after [spoiler]Arthur died?[/spoiler]
- Special ammos feels more like a gimmick than an actual essential combat tool.[/td]

	[td] + Gunplay with the Dead Eye system is amazing.
+ Lots of customization options for your horses, outfits and weapons.
+ Tons of things to do. You can do missions, visit landmarks, collect collectibles, upgrade your camp, weapons and buy outfits etc, as well as hunting animals, robbing people and trains and encountering unique events with the people, playing minigames, or simply have a shootout with the law. 
- Gold medals are just too painful.

	[td][/td]
	[td]+ Multiple ways to interact with almost any NPCs, and they react realistically (for the most part). You can rob, greet, antagonize and even apologise to them after knocking into them.
+ Gang Members interact with each other like real people. AI never felt more alive
+ One of the best AIs I have seen.
- Why not make the AI react to being shot in the leg and not suddenly die from a leg shot since they are already going for realism? [/td]

	[td]
- Map controls are horrible. Removing markers will teleport you all around the map to other markers you placed, and when you first open the map, it shows you your destination instead of where you are.
- Many erroneous subtitles
- No option to restart mission when replaying
- No UI to indicate weight progress[/td]

Do not go into this game thinking its GTA V with wild west and horses, it's not. This game is all about the story and characters. Often times the gameplay can be slow paced and some missions can take up to 15-20 minutes of just dialogue and horse back riding, but when the missions get intense they get really intense.

If I had one drawback about this game, it would be about the health, stamina and dead eye cores. Sometimes they can be a chore to manage because you need to run to stores to buy supplies every once and a while. This can sometimes be alleviated if you loot dead bodies after large encounters.

I don't think I ever played a game with this level of immersion and detail. I got lost in everything I did, the stranger missions, the random encounters, the fauna and of course, the incredible story. Arthur's gotta be one of the, if not the best developed character in video game history. Like, oh my god, this game is HUGE.

However it is also the game that made me wonder how much level of realism we really need in videogames.
Everything you do is as real as life itself: eating, sleeping, bathing, god damn shaving. RDR2 presents you with all this menial tasks to be completed randomly, and it doesn't stop there. If you were thinking of living your outlaw fantasy easily, you were in the wrong my man. Movement and animations, and gameplay in general is predicated to be AS REAL AS it can possibly be. I can't tell how many times I got stabbed while trying to unholster my gun (which I swear is a nightmare, sometimes the input is so laggy that you can't take your gun out at all). I guess they were trying to make it, you know, just like in the wild west. You f*** around and find out for sure. This game really forces you to play under it's own rules; no more effing around. You wanna live in the west, well you gotta earn it. And once you do, man is this game fine.

Now, I can let slide those minor inconviniences, which are barely inconviniences at all, they are just the rules of the experience, because it's so perfect and unbelievably great, that this is definitively one of the most amazing games I've ever played. It's that simple. MUST PLAY.

The realism and attention to detail is unreal. Who wouldn't love a western cowboy open-world game with guns and lasso, along with a rich story and numerous side characters and character development. 

Pros: Bullet holes that drains water, NPC interactions, NPC environment progress, Rag-doll physics, and much much more. Washing off blood and dirt off your horse by waddling in water, Skinning animals and sell parts, take on bounty roles or collection. Realism.

Cons: Online interactions. There is no chat box. A lot of hostile players that will shoot-on-sight and chase you down. Hard to earn money without doing dishonorable stuff. Shop items are expensive and most requires unlocking or reach a specific rank. Can't really buy any cheap wagons except if you're in roles and unlock hunting or collector wagon, but that's pretty much it.",1706910266,1706910266,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Characters have little to no enjoyability, the story is just weak, and its comedy falls flat with such a consistency that that its no better than the recent Saint's Row reboot, with the mild saving grace that it doesnt TRY to be funny every 5 seconds. However, the experience of driving around listening to a great soundtrack, upgrading your cars and weapons, and participating in a small variety of side jobs and the missions that don't dictate your every move was undeniable. Not to mention its MP, which was genuinely great until Rockstar bloated it with flying missile launching cars and other pay-to-grief mechanics.

Flip that coin over and you get RDR2, a great game with many lackluster to terrible elements; Characters are vivid and realistic, the story is one of the best in games, and its few moments of levity are not only well written, but also well earned. However, the experience of riding around on your horse listening to its scant but evocative string plucks of music is incredibly dull, interrupted only by the random acts of violence you can perform on passersby and the occasional O'Driscoll/Raider shootout. There are basically no missions where you aren't directed moment by moment to do a specific thing and upgrading your horses and weapons is much less impactful than desired. Not to mention it's MP, which never got to a good point before Rockstar again bloated it with pay-to-have-more-fun mechanics this time.

as an open world singleplayer game, RDR2 is still 100 percent worth the playthrough, no doubt, but im increasingly mad RDR1 hasn't been ported over yet.",1620710177,1706909552,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Been playing RDO with friends (privately via a certain file you can download or something)
Anyways, RDO is fucking broken. It hasn't recieved any actual updates in literal years.
You WILL crash every 15-ish minutes on normal servers, there is no fun lategame activity you can do, you don't grind towards anything.
You will run the same 4 mission format types over and over and over to level up and get new weapons to use those weapons in the exact same missions.

Now you have roles (for premium currency which takes ~2 weeks to grind ingame if you want to be F2P)(1 week if you 2A your account you get 10 gold) which are semi interesting, but truthfully only the bountyhunter role is worth it, since that's the only one that gives you gold in addition to money, but as soon as you have the license you have full access to all the different bounties (legendary ones being the key ones I mean) Some are very interesting but almost impossible solo. (wolfman is for example annoying as shit, since wolves will 2 hit you regardless of hp it just measures time between hits I think, same with some missions in swamps, sometimes a random puma will spawn and kill you, which can be frustrating since if you're high enough rank with said bounty, you will have 0 team lives, and leggy bounties are on a 48 minute timer (invisible timer))

Overall, just if you want to play SP for the story, It's a definite recommend. I've heard nothing but good things and I've seen nothing but good things (that's a lie, game is clunky as fuck in movement and horses can be annoying as fuck by randomly falling, randomly not jumping, NPC's getting agressive over nothing, but that's just R* things, movement is the same as GTA5 just clunky) so it is extremely worth buying it, it's a great story game, gorgeous visuals, and fun to be a hunter.

For MP, don't. R* is a greedy shitholy company that is just out for your money. Look at sharkcards in GTA5.
I think they stopped updating RDO to 'force' people to go over to GTA5 and spend their money there. And when GTA6 is released they'll break GTA5 online to force the playerbase (cashcows) over to their new game.",1706898413,1706898413,False,1,0,0.501545608043670654,0,True,False,False

*STORY MODE*
I'm sure that you have heard that this game is slower-paced. While that is kind of true at the beginning, once you get into it, it's amazing. Definitely would recommend 10/10. Best way to describe this game, it's kind of like a movie, you have to get into it and enjoy it. Game itself is a masterpiece, AMAZING STORY, graphics wise the game is gorgeous. It's definitely one of those games which you HAVE TO PLAY at least once.

ONLINE:
While the ONLINE portion of the game is fun, and enjoyable for a specific amount of time, after some time it ends up being little bit too grindy for what it is, at the same time as it is lacking content. Definitely a lot of fun if you have friends to play with.

 Good game is good, but there are so many details packed into every aspect of this game EXCEPT THE CRIME AND GETTING AWAY WITH CRIME. It's basically reskinned gta5. The cops have body cameras and radios and teleporters but are mounted on horses and instantly recognize you and there's nothing you can do about it. 3 guys try to rob you and you bare knuckle brawl them to death in self defense with an entire city full of whitnesses? That's a hundred dollar bounty on your head partner. Did all that just happen while you were wearing a full hood covering your identity? Well the cops use body scans so they still send people after you.

So if you don't want to don't want to spend all your time in game running from the cops and trying to figure out wtf just happened and why is the bystander pulling gun on you instead of like, you know, doing the story missions and shit... then you should play a different game. Basically everyone in the game is allowed to do crime and get away with it except you.

This game is a masterclass in story telling and world building, nearly as good as TLOU.

As you play through the story you find yourself coming across situations that end differently based solely off your actions.
One of the first actions involve a man who recognises you from Blackwater. You can let this man fall off a cliff to their death  to keep ensure his silence, or pull them up to save them. If they fall then you need not worry about him maybe telling the authority's where you're holed up but you will lose some honour. If you save the man then you gain some honour and he stays silent anyway... albeit under a threatening manner.

The story is built and effected by your choices. You can be rude to everyone you meet and kill without mercy. You can be kind to everyone you meet and show mercy when you can. The people in your gang/camp will notice and have different dialogues based solely off your choices.

 My first play through was spent helping the gang out with chores but showing no mercy to those outside the camp boundaries. In other words, outside the camp was no man's land. I let that man fall to his death to ensure his silence. After all, dead men tell no tales... right?
The further into the story you go, you will find moments where you're confronted with either a coyote or a buck.
The coyote symbolises your misdeeds while the buck symbolises your good deeds.
The character has a goodness in him that is buried deep below his loyalty to the leader of the gang, and his father figure, Dutch. 

Throughout the story I would do horrible things I thought I had to in order to keep the camp/gang safe. Through the story, a philosophical question comes into play. Do the ends justify the means? The end being to escape society's unstoppable thrust into the untamed world from where the gang came from. 

Dutch's goal goes from escaping society to getting back at society for all he's lost. He begins to spiral because every action he makes against society leads to something going horribly wrong and getting someone he cares for killed. Which makes him want to take more revenge against society. An endless loop.
Dutch, by definition, is insane. He goes from caring about his family to willing to sacrifice them for a feud with a rival gang and his thirst for revenge against society he thinks caused the death of his family members. 
He makes the same mistakes over and over again. Repeating outcomes that lessen the dream he once held of getting everyone out of the life. 

Arthur becomes the good man he was always meant to be by slowly coming to realise the man he once looked up to is going down a path that will get his family killed. Arthur admits that he hates dept collecting, all the needless killing and the death of gang members gets Arthur to question if the ends truly justify the means. What is the point of reaching paradise if all the people you care about are dead?

The story ends on a note that leaves you blubbering like a baby or fighting back tears as Arthur's journey comes to an end.
Based on how you played the game and the choices you made, you can get two endings where Arthur is remember fondly or he is remembered cruelly.
What I wouldn't give to play the main story for the first time.

Now for the world building...
B E A U T I F U L!
With my PC I have no choice but to play on low settings, but the game is still outstanding. 
The thick and soupy air in the swamp, the shiver down your spine in the snowy mountains, the fresh air and vibrancy of the woods. 
The towns make you feel like you're really in the 1890's The pubs, stores, hotel, stable, the people, the clothing, the general attitude of everyone you talk to. The atmosphere is truly astonishing.
The graphics are still top notch even to today's standards. 
The fluidity of the animations and movements makes everything flow smoothly and precisely.

Rockstar know's how to make a game look good and more importantly know how to emotionally involve you into the world and characters. The voice actors deserve the praise they receive based off their stellar performances. 
Every argument, every heartfelt talk, every gut wrenching moment makes you feel like you ARE the main character.
The dialogue doesn't feel clunky or forced like some games *Cough cough* MWIII *Cough* Excuse me, sorry. That was strange.
It feels natural and real. It draws you in. 

Would I suggest this game? YES!!!!
Even if you've watched a play through. When you get to make the hard choices, when you get to decide mercy or death, when you decide how the game ends it feels much more rewarding. 
At the end you'll feel remorse for your less than honourable actions and wish you could go back to change some.
Or you can also be happy knowing you died being selfish, a dealer of death and have no remorse or regret. 

That's the beauty of this game. I believe the actions you choose says a lot about your own character. 
Will you take the risk and spare the man hanging off the cliff?
Will you refuse mercy and ensure his silence?
The choice is truly yours to make.",1589577927,1706849190,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Red Dead Redemption 2, prequel to Red Dead Redemption 1, is a visually stunning game that follows the heartbreaking story of the outlaw Arthur Morgan and his journey to redemption.

Red Dead Redemption remains many people's favourite game; even after the game has been completed, still having many weapons, animals, clothes and overall ""customisables"" to unlock. Additionally, the game keeps audiences interested with many side missions, as well as constantly immersing the viewer in the story that is [spoiler] the downfall and destruction of the Van Der Linde gang. [/spoiler] 

In addition to the story, the game centres itself around various characters; all with interesting backstories and subtle but effective character development as the game progresses, e.g; [spoiler] Arthur Morgan, the main protagonist, (depending on your honour level), goes from a sarcastic outlaw to a selfless hero - chapter 1 through to chapter 6 and Dutch Van Der Linde transforming from a charismatic leader in chapter 1 to a ruthless and psychotic murderer in chapter 6 [/spoiler]. These characters are incredibly well written, allowing audiences to sympathise with said character and feel strongly attached to them - for example, (to my knowledge), every time a character dies in Red Dead Redemption, the audience will feel upset as they have been attached to said character over the course of their playtime (several hours).

The gameplay is incredibly simple - most of the game just having to shoot those shooting at you, but still having unique features: The ""Deadeye"" feature allows players to draw their weapon at a swift speed, allowing the player to fire multiple accurate shots in a short span of time. Additionally, the game includes an underused ""drawing"" system, similar to ""Deadeye"", allowing players to quickly equip their weapon and fire a shot into their opposition.

Overall, Red Dead Redemption 2 is a highly adored video game that has a strongly immersive story, simple gameplay mechanics and an addictive abundance of unlockables. I implore that you should play Red Dead Redemption 2.

[h3] TL;DR: [/h3]

This game is absolutely amazing. You do NOT need to have played the previous game to understand and enjoy this one, though it's always good to look up a synopsis of what happened in RDR1 or play the game itself. Either way, jump in and enjoy this masterpiece for what it is.

I'd recommend doing all side quests as they appear because you may miss out on some when you move from chapter to chapter. Also avoid purchasing weapons and outfits in the early game - you'll get plenty as you progress through the game. Now go and enjoy the game, it'll be well worth your time!

I have a difficult time suggesting this game as it took me upgrading to a ryzen 7 7800x3d cpu to play the game. under no circumstances should i not have been able to launch the game with a BRAND NEW AM5 system. 
i have a new am5 system that can run anything from starfield to the last of us to jedi survivor to hogwarts legacy with no issues whatsoever, yet this game does nothing but launch a nonresponsive black screen. i have found with some publishers that also require their own launcher that you need the game and the launcher on the same ssd. ive tried it on the same ssd as well as the other ssd. same result on both ssds. 

i have now passed my return window of ""time played"" although ive not been able to actually get the game to launch. 

when i launch the game it loads the rockstar launcher then opens another window that goes non responsive. i have to control alt delete to be able to close the processes... when i do so, steam just says stopping. while i can still launch other steam games after the ""stopping"" is frozen on steam, i have to completely reset my pc to get it to allow me to even attempt to relaunch the game again. 

look, i have spent over $3000 on building this PC like 6 months ago. it can play all available games on ultra settings, yet cant even launch a game that was released half a decade ago...

I understand now after playing this game why Red Dead Redemption 2 was NOT game of the year 2018, because Red Dead Redemption 2 is game of the decade. 
If you are interested in playing this game,  avoid looking up the game trailers, YouTube comment sections and even the looking at the lyrics of the Original Soundtrack. Go in blind and just enjoy the ride.

The story is riveting and captivating.  You are immediately absorbed into the world of Arthur Morgan and his gang ( literally his gang) and as the story progresses you quickly learn your place in the world of the Wild West. Probably my favorite aspects of the main story is 1. The moral ambiguity of your position, a bandit who also takes care of his own, faced with multiple instances of having to choose right or wrong, the better or the worse option you can feel like you mold Arthur in a direction you choose. 2. The variety of missions, from Outlaw to Deputy to Outlaw again. Missions done in secret, breaking down the door, raiding a plantation, raiding a graveyard, working with the scum of the west in the hills or the crooked politicians in Saint Denis. This game has it ALLL
Graphics are STILL to this day some of the best you will ever see in any video game 
And what makes it even better is Rockstar found the perfect way to make the world come alive, not just look good. Travel down the road to find people in distress or perhaps theyll pay you even, get stopped by 3 men at gun point? It all happens, the animals flee or attack depending. The weather changes and the reflection on your clothes... it all matters, Even if you shoot a barrel 3 times , one at the top, one in the middle and one in the botttom... youll see the water levels reduce as the water flows out.

Red Dead Redemption stands as a shining example of narrative excellence within the realm of video games, weaving a breathtaking, amazing, and heartfelt story set against the vast, untamed landscapes of the American Wild West. Developed by Rockstar Games, this open-world masterpiece not only captivates players with its stunning visuals and dynamic gameplay but also immerses them in a profound and emotionally charged narrative that transcends the boundaries of the gaming medium.

From the outset, Red Dead Redemption draws players into the compelling life of John Marston, a former outlaw seeking redemption in a world that is rapidly changing. The game's narrative unfolds with cinematic precision, revealing a rich tapestry of characters, each with their own dreams, struggles, and moral dilemmas. As players traverse the expansive frontier, encountering a diverse cast of personalities, they become engrossed in the intricacies of their stories, forging deep connections with the characters and the world they inhabit.

The Wild West setting serves as more than just a backdrop; it is a character in itself, shaping the narrative and influencing the actions of the protagonists. The attention to detail is unparalleled, with vast, sweeping landscapes that shift seamlessly from arid deserts to snowy mountains. The immersive world of Red Dead Redemption is teeming with life, from the bustling towns to the serene beauty of the wilderness, creating an environment that feels alive and authentic.

What sets Red Dead Redemption apart is its ability to evoke genuine emotion from players. The narrative is not a mere series of missions but a heartfelt exploration of themes such as love, loss, and the inexorable passage of time. John Marston's quest for redemption is a poignant and deeply human journey that resonates on a visceral level. The game's writers masterfully blend action-packed sequences with moments of quiet reflection, allowing players to connect with the characters on a profound emotional level.

The voice acting and character animations further enhance the storytelling, bringing the cast to life with a level of realism that is nothing short of extraordinary. Whether it's the grizzled wisdom of Dutch van der Linde or the fiery spirit of Bonnie MacFarlane, every character feels like a fully realized individual with their own hopes, fears, and motivations.

In conclusion, Red Dead Redemption stands as a testament to the potential of video games as a storytelling medium. It combines breathtaking visuals, engaging gameplay, and a narrative that is as compelling as any found in literature or film. Through its carefully crafted characters, evocative setting, and emotional depth, the game transcends the boundaries of entertainment, offering players an immersive and unforgettable journey into the heart of the Wild West. Red Dead Redemption is more than a game; it is a work of art that leaves an indelible mark on the hearts and minds of those who experience its captivating tale.",1706678240,1706678240,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

This is something completely different. Hell, I've played both GTA 5 and RDR2 completely, RDR2 definitely beats in nearly all ways possible. Although I'm unsure of what GTA 6 has in store for us, RDR2 will be difficult to surpass in genuine fun and storytelling. You can do just about everything in the game. Go hunting, have fun with gang members, go rob a house, or a store, possibly go start a massacre in a town, find new horses, study and skin all the animals in the game, just go explore and listen to the music, find all the plants and herbs, find all the guns, visit all the strangers, and so much more.

I have spent over 2 hours and still haven't started the  game because until all conflicts are resolved the game warns that my changes will be lost. Most of these keys I have no idea how they are to be used, a lot of them I don't want to ever use.
 
There are so many commands that I literally had to test keys to find ones that aren't in use so that I could assign something them. When I finally get in game and find out how things work I will have to put many of those keys somewhere useful which will mean juggling all the others around to fit a new keyboard layout.

Developed by Rockstar Games, the same studio behind the Grand Theft Auto series, RDR2 elevates the standards of open-world gaming to unprecedented heights. 

   Graphics 10/10
  From the moment you set foot in the sprawling open world, it's impossible not to be captivated by the breathtaking graphics and attention to detail. The game's visuals are a testament to the advancements in gaming technology, delivering a level of realism that immerses players in the vast and dynamic landscapes. The changing weather, day-night cycles, and realistic physics contribute to an unparalleled sense of immersion.

    Characters And Story Mode 10/10

  RDR2's narrative is a triumph in storytelling, creating a compelling and emotionally charged experience. The protagonist, Arthur Morgan, is a deeply nuanced character whose journey is shaped by the choices players make. The supporting cast is equally well-crafted, each with their own stories and motivations. The intricate relationships and evolving dynamics within the Van der Linde gang add layers of complexity to the narrative, making every interaction meaningful. The game's pacing is deliberate, allowing players to savor the unfolding drama. Rockstar has masterfully blended action, drama, and introspection, creating a narrative that explores themes of loyalty, morality, and the consequences of one's actions. RDR2's story is a triumph that transcends the gaming medium, comparable to the best works in literature and film.


   Open World Quality And Interactions 9/10

     The open-world design of RDR2 is a marvel. The vast landscapes, ranging from snow-covered mountains to swamps teeming with life, invite exploration. The attention to detail extends beyond the visual aspect, with a living, breathing ecosystem. Wildlife behaves realistically, and the world reacts to the player's actions.


  Gameplay Mechanics / Realism / Immersion 8/10

 The gameplay mechanics of RDR2 are both intuitive and complex. From gunplay to horseback riding, every action feels grounded and authentic. The attention to realism is evident in the need to maintain Arthur's health, stamina, and Dead Eye core. This adds a layer of strategy, as players must manage resources and make choices that impact Arthur's well-being. The attention to detail extends to the interactions with the environment. Whether it's the meticulous reloading of firearms or the realistic portrayal of horse bonding, every aspect of the game is designed with a commitment to authenticity. The realism enhances the overall immersion, making every moment feel consequential.


 Technical Aspects and Performance 7/10

 RDR2 is a technical marvel, but it demands robust hardware to unleash its full potential. The PC version, in particular, shines with its enhanced graphics options and customization. However, the game's performance can be demanding on lower-end systems, requiring players to strike a balance between visual fidelity and smooth gameplay. Despite occasional technical hiccups, such as minor glitches or frame rate drops, the overall experience is polished. The attention to detail, dynamic lighting, and realistic animations showcase Rockstar's commitment to delivering a visually stunning and technically impressive game.

 Conclusion/ Overall |  10/10
Red Dead Redemption 2 is more than a game; it's an immersive, emotional, and thought-provoking experience. Rockstar Games has set a new standard for open-world storytelling, creating a world that feels alive and evolving. From the stunning visuals to the deep narrative and engaging gameplay, RDR2 is a triumph on multiple fronts. The game's impact extends beyond the gaming community, resonating with those who appreciate storytelling as an art form. It's a testament to the potential of video games as a medium for delivering compelling narratives and meaningful experiences. While the game may not be for everyone due to its deliberate pacing and commitment to realism, those who invest the time will find themselves rewarded with one of the most memorable gaming experiences of this generation. Red Dead Redemption 2 stands as a shining example of what is possible in the world of interactive entertainment, and its influence will undoubtedly be felt for years to come.
