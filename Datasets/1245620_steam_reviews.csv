Game isn't fun for me at all. Movements in the game feel sluggish and slow. The way you get rewarded with new weapons etc is very bland and boring. The developers don't really seem like big fans of multiplayer because they don't allow you to do everything in the game with a friend. The only way you can get around this is with the use of some cool mods. Other users opinions will differ of course but I'll have to say the idea of mastering each fight in the game is cool but the movements just feel too realistic for me and by that I mean slow.

First of all, writing. I don't mean ""lore"" in general - it's pretty dope. But how the characters (especially bosses) talk... gosh, it's weak. In Dark Souls 1, for example, bosses were silent and menacing. Here, when you approach a boss, they consider it their duty to say something to you, and their sayings sound so dull, lackluster and pretentious! It's like in anime, when a villain says something like: ""You beat me... But it wasn't even my final form!"" I'd like it, if it was once, maximum twice, but it happens almost every goddamn time!
Also, about bosses. Why are they so obsessed with using parts of their bodies as a weapon? I don't mean their fists, for example, but a lot of bosses like to cut off/tear off their own body parts and turn them into weapons. Again, it was cool for the first time, but it happens really often.
Catacombs are boring (and you have to visit a lot of catacombs). They're gray, full of dull skeletons and imps. There is serious lack of variety in enemy design - multi-colored zombies, some knights... 
I hate Lake of Rot. Yeah, when I played DS1 and 2, I didn't like the Blighttown and Black Gulch, but they're much better than this stupid lake. In the Blighttown you can completely evade contacting poison, so everything depends on your skills. Here you HAVE TO contact this freaking disease! It's like Farron Keep in DS3. And Farron Keep was awful.

I dont like to study moves/attacks/dodges of every boss in the game. This game is so annoying. Not for all people.

On the other hand the game is a masterpiece. The music, graphic, art style of the world and monsters is incredible. A lot of work was put into development of this game.

The annoying part is to learn the moves/attacks of bosses. I may die over 30 times and still dont know how to avoid some of the attacks. It is also a luck in my case that a boss use type of attack I can dodge/avoid.
The game dont tell you which of the summoning spells is better. You dont see the stats. I used Banished Knight Oleg +10 and he is not that good. Then I used Mimic tear ashes +10 and it is way much better. More DMG more HP, range attack, etc. Much easier to fight bosses. I didnt have any stats/information so I stick to Oleg throught entire game except of final Boss.
It is not pleasant that you have to search in the internet what is good or bad.

from the beautiful world, to the intriguing lore, to the 100s of completely different builds you can do, there is just so much here.

you can play this game so many times and have a completely different experience with a different weapon. note a single game series offers build and gameplay variety like souls games do. hundred's of weapons and spells are at your disposable for whatever build your heart desires.

the world is simply incredible and so vast. 60 hours into the game, i thought ""surely this would be the final area"" only to be disproven as i walk into a huge new region.

no other game gives you the feeling of satisfaction that you get when you overcome a souls boss. it is a fantastic gameplay loop that everyone should try

The feeling of revisiting the Lands Between never gets old with the variety of weapons.

If you're on the fence about diving into the vast, breathtaking world of Elden Ring, let me be the nudge that sends you plummeting into one of the most rewarding gaming experiences of our generation. 
What truly sets Elden Ring apart is its unparalleled weapon variety. Whether you fancy yourself a nimble swordsman, a brute force hammer wielder, or a sorcerer with arcane might, there's something here indeed!

But let's talk about the crown jewel of Elden Ring: Leyndell, Royal Capital. There's no feeling quite like the first time you set foot in this majestic, fallen city. The architecture, the enemies, the lore, and oh, the music. The haunting melodies that accompany your exploration through Leyndell are nothing short of a masterpiece, echoing the glory and tragedy of the Erdtree's guardians. It's a favorite area for it's music next to Limgrave for me!

and with Shadow of the Erdtree in the coming months, there's never been a better time to dive in! See you in the Lands Between, fellow Tarnished. May your journey be grand, and may you find your own grace.

The music is an absolute delight and the boss fights are varied, fun and best of all, difficult.

What an experience. A satisfying and expansive open world, with beautiful sights and decrepit mysteries to uncover, all combined together with the Souls formula to make a one of a kind, masterpiece. There's almost nothing that I can't praise about this game, it's all extremely excellent. Especially look out for the challenging boss fights, this one does not hold back. While it has very few flaws, like re-use of assets or a tiny few performance issues, it still holds up as a nearly flawless video game.

Elden Ring is a lovely experience that I believe everyone should try out. It's challenging, but satisfying and rewarding, mechanically intricate and lets the player guide their own experience. Don't be afraid to ask for help though, you might need it. Even I had some help from my friends, as a newbie, they were extremely knowledgeable and helpful even now, so thank you to them. Elden Ring is also playable with friends, which while quite limited, is still great to hop on and just traverse The Lands Between together.

10/10, thank you for reading.

In my 45+ hours of gameplay I have rage-quitted only once trying to fight the Crucible Knight: I was a bit under leveled for him and just couldn't defeat him, especially in the second half of the boss fight where he used magic wings and a magic dragon tail. After rage-quitting I leveled a little the next day and eventually managed to defeat him. And exactly two days later the trailer for SHADOW OF THE ERDTREE drops. Man was I even more hooked into this game afterwards. And despite all the other amazing new gameplay mechanics (like foot-weapons and throwing bowls filled with burning oil) I am most excited about getting the exact same magical wings the Crucible Knight used!

Needless to say, the game is not for people, who want to relax and have a relaxing evening, but for those  who love a challenge. And I'm one of those.

BloodBorne being my favorite FromSoft game and DS2 being my favorite Dark Souls game. After the hundreds of hours put into those games its easy to point out the good and the bad. FromSoft have come a long way and have been able to encompass all of the positive aspects of their previous souls games and put them all into Elden Ring. 
If you are new to the Souls-Like style of games I feel that Elden Ring would be an excellent place to start your journey. It's world is beautiful, full of secrets, and endless areas to explore. The game has a unique and familiar charm only Souls games can offer. It's challenging but not impossible. It gives such a sense of accomplishment and growth as a player. I cannot recommend it enough! 

Pros: 
Beautiful open world environment 
Combat feels smooth and rewarding 
Endless battle styles and character customization 
Large amount of unique weapons, armor, and spells 
Bosses are intriguing and at times mesmerizing 
Jolly cooperation! 

Cons: 
Dungeons offer uniqueness but are recycled 
Field Bosses/Dungeon Bosses are recycled 
Many re-skinned enemies 

Be Good To Each Other and Stay Safe Out There!

I played this game on release, and it's probably the best open-world I've ever experienced. The sound design, art design, atmosphere, lore are all AMAZING, but.. I think this is probably my least favourite SoulsBorne game.. (i haven't played DS2 or Sekiro yet). I'm also gonna add that I had an extremely buggy first experience at launch which has soured my opinion on the game overall, even after most of the bugs have been fixed(some are still in there though).

While the bosses look awesome and are well crafted, visually, I don't find enjoyment in fighting most of them. I can count on one hand how many I actually felt satisfied after killing. They're really tedious, repetitive and the reward never really made it worth it, at least for me. The game really didn't need so many bosses, cause you can tell they had to re-use bosses to compensate. I'd rather have fewer, but fulfilling bosses.

A lot of the enemies, bosses items and NPCs feel a bit ""copy and paste"" from older FromSoft games, visually and animation wise. It's not THAT big of a problem considering the Dark Souls franchise has done that in all their games, it just bothers me a bit considering it's not another Dark Souls game, it's a new standalone game. If it was just like a small handful I wouldn't mind but I recognise so many re-skins and animations that are just ported from their older games.

Looting is extremely unsatisfying. The amount of times I've worked my way through a boss or an area or just a specific section with a chest reward at the end, only to open it and get a flower, or something that was useless. It's just playing with your expectations, under-delivering BIG TIME and a waste of a chest. When i see a chest I expect something more ""special"" like and armour set/piece, weapon, talisman, tool or quest item, and yes chests are used for that too but majority of the time it's just trash. The good loot is often just on random copses in the game that you might just run past if you're not a loot goblin like my ass.

In my first playthrough at launch, I got really far into the game, near the end of Crumbling Farum Azula, but i got so tired of forcing myself to ""give it another try"" that I stopped playing and forgot about it. It had gotten so bad that I saved areas for second playthroughs, so that I'd have another reason to play the game more.
I started a couple of other playthroughs after but never got far with them either and gave up earlier. It wasn't until I tried playing it with a mod (seamless-coop) which made it a lot more fun and I found myself wanting to play more. Still had my moments where I just did not enjoy myself at all, it also kind of removed the ""rewarding"" feeling of defeating a boss since it makes it easier, but it's not like the game had that to begin with either way imo. 

The game is not bad, FAR from it. I just have some issues with it that really ruins my experience with the game, most of them being issues with the boss design, everything else i could try to excuse.
Generally i do recommend it cause its not a bad game, i'd just rather play Dark Souls 3 for the 672nd time(over-exaggeration, I have just played through the game more than I can count).

I hope the upcoming DLC is better than the base game, especially the bosses, and I actually have high hopes, and expectations for it. I believe it'll be good and maybe it'll change my overall opinion of the game.",1645894902,1708802261,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However there were some people who were concern about the storage space when this DLC comes out and I was in the same boat until I did some research on it. It turns out that during a review with Hidetaka Miyazaki, It turns out that the map size of the DLC will be the same as Limgrave, which is 1/6 of the base game itself.

R. Martin. This collaboration has birthed a world so dense and intricate, it makes the lore of ""Dark Souls"" seem like bedtime stories for wayward knights.

[b]Graphics & Performance:[/b]
This masterpiece of a game is a mixed bag of splendid vistas and occasional graphical hiccups that remind you of the game's mortal origins. The Lands Between are breathtaking, offering landscapes that range from hauntingly beautiful to ""I need to pause and take a breather"" levels of oppressive. On PC, performance can vary like the effectiveness of your dodges; with the right hardware, (capped at 60fps) the game runs smoother than a butter-slathered Slip 'N Slide, but on older rigs, it can feel like trudging through the swamps of Aeonia.

[b]Gameplay:[/b]
[b]Elden Ring[/b] is an evolution of the Souls formula, refined to a radiant sheen. Combat is as punishing and rewarding as explaining the game's plot coherently. The introduction of horseback combat and a sprawling open world filled with secrets, dungeons, and bosses so tough they'll make you question your life choices, elevates the experience. The freedom to explore and tackle challenges in a non-linear fashion ensures that masochism has never been more inviting.

[b]Story & Lore:[/b]
The narrative, co-crafted by George R. R. Martin, is as deep and convoluted as one might expect. Players are left to piece together the lore from cryptic conversations, environmental storytelling, and item descriptions that require a PhD in FromSoftware-ese to fully comprehend. The story is there, somewhere, hidden beneath layers of mystery and the occasional Elden Lord ready to pound you into the ground for looking at them funny.

[b]Sound & Music:[/b]
The sound design and music are, simply put, a triumph. Combat sounds pack the punch of a Great Rune in your face, while the score ranges from hauntingly serene to ""this is the end of me"" boss battle symphonies. The auditory experience in [b]Elden Ring[/b] does more than just complement the visuals and gameplay; it elevates the entire experience into something ethereal.

[b]The Verdict:[/b]
[b]Elden Ring[/b] is an epic in every sense of the word. It's a game that respects your intelligence enough to get utterly lost in its world without a guiding hand, ensuring that victories are as sweet as discovering a shortcut after hours of peril. It's a testament to the art of game design, even if it occasionally feels like it was created by a sadistic architect who enjoys watching players fall to their doom. For those willing to embrace its challenge, [b]Elden Ring[/b] offers an adventure as rewarding as it is punishing, proving once again that FromSoftware is the master of making us love the pain.",1708620945,1708795630,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

     A truly beautiful masterwork of FromSoftware, their magnum opus. Despite this being a game brimming with love for design and finely-tuned mechanics, this game made me hate FromSoftware with a vindictive ire that I have yet to feel for any other company. The loathing that I feel when loading this game is akin to going to work, or school, or even just basic yet tedious house chores. Never before or since has a video game made me feel such irksome and fervent irritation. I quite literally, actually feel it under my skin at times. This game makes me feel my blood pressure raise; a sensation not familiar to me since my first time playing Dark Souls 1. I do not consider that a net positive, however I felt it prudent to note. Never before have the impacts of my own minuscule and minute mistakes caused such violent and visceral knee-jerk reactions as when fighting the most basic of enemies or the earliest of roaming-bosses. 

     Despite all of the aforementioned and highly discouraging information I have listed above, I still play due to some suspected masochistic impulses, self-hateful tendencies, or otherwise straightforward bullheadedness and unshakable stubbornness combined with a need to prove some ability to meet unnecessary and meaningless achievements to myself. As if by completing this quite difficult and punishing video game I will stumble upon some self-actualization through pattern recognition or simple brute-forcing of the situation.

    When looking back on my past experience with the rest of this series over the years, I have come to the conclusion that this game is Dark Souls with Bloodborne bosses. I'm sure that this is a common feeling among the community who have come into contact with this purulent heap of enticing suffering. This game feels smooth yet, clunky. It feels open or even free-form, yet air-tight. It feels impactful and all the more so when you mistime a dodge by fractions of a second and die to the most mundane things. I can never get a word in when fighting against bosses, so here are all the words I could think of saying. The exploration is perfected, the weapon system is expansive with options to fit any niche you might want to try. the options for magic are varied and satisfying to those who enjoy such a play-style. And yet... with all these options available to me, being able to travel far and wide to distant lands to power-level and omega-buff my weapon to fuck-all... I still insist on fighting the Tree Sentinel and Ulcerated Tree Spirit at base level because I hate myself.

However, getting back into the game has proven more challenging than anticipated. While the game boasts stunning visuals and occasional moments of enjoyment, it also resurfaces all the frustrations that made me question why I am playing it again. Yet, here I am, giving it another shot, perhaps motivated by the promise of DLC content.

Elden Ring demands both skill and luck, particularly evident in encounters where boss attack patterns defy logic. It can feel frustrating to dodge only to get hit and suffer significant damage. While some games handle leveling and progression more effectively, Elden Ring seems to lack meaningful differentiation in this regard.

This game by far is not the hardest fromsoft game. You can beat this game by doing an ""easy mode"" build from the get go. Sekiro is stupid hard in my opinion compared to elden ring. 
The music in this game is S tier, I dont know what it is about Japanese composers, but they on some good ish.
The world in this game is beautifully mesmerizing. Limgrave, the first area, makes you literally stop playing for a cool min just to take in the sight as you open the first door to it after the tutorial.

It is already added by modders and you can use Flawless Widescreen to fix it. It took them like couple of hours.

Or actually you CAN'T use it or you will get BANNED by EAC

60fps lock and ultrawide support in 2024 is still baffling, especially when modders have been unlocking the FPS counter in their games succesfully for years. They haven't even bothered to improve on this one bit.
Their frame limiter is still HORRIBLE and provides terrible frametimes, ALWAYS. This is a known issue and affects their titles on console as well. Removing their FPS lock and using a better frame limiter (like rivatuner) fixes the frame pacing issues.

This game is an outlier in the market since it has Raytracing without any upscaling solution, on an already graphically intensive game at 4k. It doesn't need saying that raytracing in this game is basically not playable at a stable 4K 60fps without a 4090, and for no reason at all. So it was included and it looks great but it cannot be used unless you like playing in photo mode. There are mods which easily enable DLSS for this game. Implementing DLSS or any other upscaling solution is the minimum that the market is at. Japanese devs still have issues with basic PC needs, even though they're slowly improving.

Other than that, performance issues from launch have actually been fixed. Make SURE to have DOCP enabled (or XMP if you're on Intel) in your mobo. 

But I cannot recommend

## Game ##

The most overrated Souls ever. These are my rankings for context:
S. Bloodborne, Demon's Souls
A. Dark Souls (would be S without the cut content), Sekiro
B. Elden Ring
C. Dark Souls II, Dark Souls III (S for the DLC), 

Not much of a new IP, but an expanded Dark Souls with a new coat of paint. It's still very good, but grandiosity has taken space away from quality. Bosses are recycled, dungeons are recycled, animations are recycled from older titles, the open world is innovative and with great surprises, but at the same time can be boring for most of the time. Balance can be lacking.

Copy and paste dungeons plagued with artificial difficulty are overabundant and really drag the game into the mud. You will find the worst level designs ever in ""Hero's Tomb's"", with fast and unkillable chariots one-shotting you when you don't run perfectly through the labyrints. In one of the dungeons you can actually destroy one of them, in the most unintuitive way possible. They don't offer any satisfaction even after clearing them, only a sour aftertaste of frustration.

Elden Ring is at its best when you reach a closed level interconnected with the open world. The Academy of Raya Lucaria, Leyndell, the Sewers, Siofra, the Halightree...They all make the open world 
pale in comparison.

The game's strongest strongest points are the art design, the addictive gameplay loop, the expansive and immersive world and the variety of builds.

It's been praised endlessly for being an open-world without quest markers, but it's not the first to do it and it's not the best at it either. NPC quests are A W F U L. At the worst they've ever been in the Souls Series.

## Quest design ##

NPC markers don't help because they don't tell you *where* NPCs will show up, they tell you the positions of NPCs you've already visited. After they move, you have to find them again.

Want to complete a character's questline? Sure! Here's this M A S S I V E map. You have to:
1. Get into one of the world's areas at random early enough so that you don't miss the quest
2. Come back to random locations at random times. Good luck finding them.
3. Find ""Layla"" or ""Nepheli"", or x new character without knowing how they look and where you should look for them. Good luck checking the whole world to no avail.
4. Beat a boss at the other end to the world to proceed with the quest's next step. Rinse and repeat.

The ACTUAL way to complete quests is to check the wiki for it. There is no other solution other than accept that you will miss on huge integral parts of the game without reading the wiki.


## Bossess and fighting mechanics ## 

Bosses are very hit and miss. Margit and Godfrey provide some of the best bosses the Souls series have ever offered, while the worst offenders are horribly balanced and show poor design that wasn't present in earlier titles. 

The gameplay highlights compared to other entry in the Souls series are:

1. Horseback fighting 
2. Enemies have delayed attacks that punish panic rolling
3. The jumping allows to dodge shockwaves far more effectively and with more reward 

Horseback fighting isn't very impressive, and looks like it wasn't given too much thought into. While it can be very fun, there is no balance to it. You *will* get hit by random attacks since you don't have a way to dodge or block. The added mobility can make up for it in some slow fights or for ranged combat, but it can be a real pain for melee. You *will* get stunlocked and get knocked off your horse, without being able to improve on that. Honestly, they really should have given some way to get i-frames on horse.

They deserve less credit for the third point since there is *no* in-game tutorial explaining that jumping actually shrinks your hurtbox and is an important form of dodging. It's also not clear which attacks you can use it for (shockwaves make sense, but not really Gurranq's fangs).

Great Runes are mostly inconsequential and should just be permanent upgrades.


## Too many fast attacks, can feel like playing Sekiro without the parry. ##

Malenia with her waterflow dance. Radhan before being patched. THE FUCKING REVENANTS.

The final boss is basically a bullet hell that should be fought on Torrent while the game doesn't allow for that to happen. 

On the bright side. They have done a nice job of rebalancing the game, and they have separated PVE and PVP scaling. And you can actually dodge Malenia's waterflow dance with the new fast roll.


## Lore ##

The lore can go from great to very confusing and uninteresting, especially when you compare it to other entries in the series. While some concepts like the rune of death are inherently cool, others can bore you to death and make you wonder why you should care, being seemingly irrelevant. ESSENTIAL cutscenes are not present in the game. You can't understand Marika's grief without watching official game story teasers on YouTube. You don't know who tf Godwin is for half of the game, and you probably still don't understand it afterward. You haven't seen Radagon fight Malenia and lots of other important lore info is straight up missing from the game and only available with other forms of media.

What this game really needs is a bestiary/archive/index with lore, where voices that link into each other as you slowly unlock objects, so that you can connect them with characters. It's hard to remember what you read in the object you picked up 20 hours ago. While this sort of narrative could work for passionate players in older titles, the size of this one really kills the experience unless you go full in and start taking notes.

The intro, while cool, is just the naming of characters and doesn't provide anything for the game's lore. It's definetely not enough to start such an ambitious narrative.

Important names always start with G, R and M, and aside from the tribute to Martin this just makes everything more confusing, and characters like to use double names.
Characters like Smithing master Hewg, Sir Gideon Ofnir, Radhan, Malenia, Margit, Rogier, Ranni are great and super interesting but media mix, cut content, quest mechanics and translation issues get in the way of the enjoyement.

Good lore is not confusing lore. They really could have done a better job with it, like they did with Demon's Souls and in part Bloodborne (yikes for translation errors).

The game leaves lots of unanswered questions, hopefully which will be answered in the DLC.

## Conclusion ##

Still better than most games you can pick up. It has lots of great moments, but there are far better Souls games. Can't recommend a game with a 60fps lock in 2024.",1646727481,1708716427,False,0,0,0.500509679317474365,0,True,False,False

Probably could have consulted a guide, but for a game this ""epic"", shouldn't have to do that. No quest tracker, just walk around and hope for something interesting? Maybe? So bad.

Elden Ring isn’t just a game; it’s an odyssey. FromSoftware has woven a tapestry of wonder, challenge, and discovery that transcends mere entertainment. Here’s why it stands tall among gaming legends:


-World Unveiled: In my 100+ hours within the Lands Between, I was spellbound. The vistas—majestic, haunting, and awe-inspiring—left me breathless. The sheer scope of this enormous open world invites exploration at every turn.

-FromSoftware’s Evolution: Elden Ring takes the baton from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and sprints with it. Freedom and curiosity drive the experience. Yet, seamlessly woven into this vast expanse lies a full-fledged Dark Souls adventure. It’s a harmonious blend that defies expectations.

-Organic Storytelling: The grand narrative unfolds subtly. As a “Tarnished,” blessed by grace, you journey toward becoming an Elden Lord. The golden tree, the enigmatic characters—I pieced together their tales, hungry for more. George R.R. Martin’s influence adds layers to this epic saga.

-Side Stories: Forget waypoints and exclamation marks. Elden Ring’s characters are real, with their own agendas. They don’t beckon; they exist. Their fates intertwine with yours, shaped by your choices. It’s storytelling at its most organic.

-Combat Mastery: The combat system—challenging, rewarding, and thrilling—demands skill. Each swing, dodge, and parry feels consequential. Boss encounters are symphonies of desperation and triumph.
Visual Splendor: Improved model quality, intricate scenes, dynamic lighting—Elden Ring is a feast for the eyes. The world breathes, pulsates, and whispers secrets.

-Community and Lore: As we unravel the lore, we become part of a global fellowship. Lore videos, discussions, and theories enrich the experience. Elden Ring isn’t just a game; it’s a shared journey.

🔥 Pros:
Breathtaking World: Jaw-dropping vistas.
Freedom and Exploration: No hand-holding.
Character Depth: Side stories that matter.
Combat Brilliance: Skill-based and satisfying.
Community Engagement: A lore-rich adventure.
🚫 Cons:
Server Hiccups: Minor inconvenience.",1645970913,1708703568,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is not a game you can just enter, grab some easy dopamine and leave. It is a massive, slow burn, immersive experience. It goes on and on and on and quality never drops. Start playing it blindly, with a lot of spare time, and you will find a very rewarding and deep experience.

Compared to other FromSoft games, the art direction here is unparalleled - the final boss is one of the best sound and visual experiences I have ever had in videogames. The more colorful environments compared to the very bland Dark Souls III are a very good change. The writing is very hidden sometimes, but it made me speculate and try to investigate some very compelling mysteries while playing, and that is the best part of FromSoft writing for me. All the plot twists will be rewarding and make sense if you do your research.

PVP is, at the very least, much more varied than previous entries in the series. I tried at least 20 builds, all of them very different and viable. The colosseums are great and really let you have a more fluid PVP experience. Some people may find that the increased ""power scale"" of the skills detract from the original, more basic-attacks-focused duels, but I find the more powerful skills add an additional tactical layer I really enjoyed.

Really worth every penny. I was afraid it would be more of the same, a ""dark souls with horses"", but the changes were really enough to make this a very special game. Thank you, Michael Zaki!",1708703257,1708703257,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Everything about feeling a sense of accomplishment and all that, I don't feel with their games.  Every boss after mid game or so just felt like ""well, the misery is finally over.""

I've periodically and slowly been working through Nioh, and I actually do enjoy that game, I feel like I'm developing actual strategies on a boss by boss basis.  In this game, my build ended up in the dreaded ""Jump+L1"" trend.  It helps I like in Nioh that item selection layout much better.  This game, and other Fromsoftware games have all your consumables on a single D-pad button (if using controller), and all the spells on a separate single one.  The other two being taken up by weapon and shield.  Nioh used a different way to select weapons and, gave more item options available at any one instance without so much swapping.  One item per D-pad direction, with a second set of 4 a single swap button away.  You get less overall options, but it's much snappier to use and I actually give a damn about item use in Nioh.

I'm also not fond of how missable everything is in this game, because I ended up having to read up on nearly every quest line to make any progress in them.  Blaidd for example, I had to look up how to initiate talking to him, I never noticed the one boss is who he was looking for, never noticed the summon spot, never saw him standing nearby outside after defeating the boss, and eventually when I got to Ranni, I was left wondering just where the hell he was.  They later hide him from you again because of spoiler reasons, and by this point I was too frustrated with every other quest line to care to hunt him down myself.

Boss reuse, to the point of them becoming common enemies for some of the earliest side bosses, just got excessive, too.  It features over 100 bosses or such, but what isn't mentioned is probably 33% or more are just rehashed as harder versions in some way.  Sometimes the same boss but bigger stats.  And if you're like me, and hate the Crucible Knight as your worst nemisis, well get ready to fight him like 6 or so if you want to beat all instances of him.",1708673291,1708673291,False,1,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False

If you heard about the DLC and are thinking ""yeah, maybe now is the time I'll finally dive in"", then this is directed at you.

Elden Ring is not for everyone. If you don't respect the grind, then it will kick the shit out of you without remorse. There is no easy mode, no save-scumming, no cheat codes, and absolutely no hand holding. Yeah sure.. you can rely on Youtubers and Wiki pages to tell you what some of the ULTIMATE BUILDS might be... but even if you're relying on a crutch like that, you STILL have to put the work in and ""git gud"" when it's all said and done. It also takes a while to even get access to all the weapons/gear that those guides expect you to be using, not to mention earning the experience needed for the build to be viable. So my suggestion to you is to worry less about building an exact carbon copy of a character that some other person already played as, and just try to take it all in and experience it for yourself first.

I got every achievement, defeated every boss, and it was the most rewarding grind I've ever embarked upon in a game. I made a lot of mistakes along the way, but I learned from every single one of them. I got my ass kicked every time I booted up the game, but every triumph I celebrated was unlike any other thanks to all of those ass-kickings. From the hardest boss fights to the most annoying mobs, you truly feel every single victory... and that's where I got hooked because the sense of accomplishment you get from progressing in Elden Ring... I'm telling you, it is the ultimate dopamine shot.

Now, I personally loved the story, but it's definitely a subjective experience. Elden Ring is a mythological story about gods and demi-gods, and if you take the time to read through the item descriptions, look closer at the game world, and try to fill in the gaps kind of like a detective would, then you will probably enjoy it too. If you are expecting the cutscenes to be the only thing you have to pay attention to in order to know what's going on, you might be disappointed. 

Without a quest menu or anything like that to keep track of things, the game forces you to do your own due diligence and keep track of the NPCs you've spoken to, and to really listen to what they say because completing side quests isn't like most open world games that just plop a waypoint down for you to walk to after you've skipped all the dialogue. You need to listen and think about it, and if you've already progressed through certain points of the main-story, then you might not even get to experience some of the side quests. This aspect of Elden Ring can be a bit frustrating because you really aren't given any indication if you've missed a part of a quest or if you missed a quest entirely until it's too late. I will just say that if you're bee-lining it straight to the main bosses, you are definitely missing a LOT of what makes the game so good (and you're also missing out on side quests that lead to valuable ITEMS and EXPERIENCE!!!). So if you don't want to miss anything, my advice is to take it all very slow, and just try to clear regions and talk to everyone you see before moving on to new areas. If you think you missed stuff, keep in mind that you can always try again in NG+. 

Multiplayer is completely optional, but opting in to allow invasions can be rewarding because testing your build against actual players is pretty fun, plus you get to also see what other people are doing with their characters. Sometimes seeing someone else in action can inspire you to try new stuff, or it can make you aware of a flaw in your own character. I will say that I personally played with the player messages turned off though because I didn't want to read possible spoilers, and I felt reading messages left by other players all over the place broke my immersion.. but to each their own.

If you've never played Elden Ring before and are finally considering a run through the game for the first time... I truly envy you because I would do anything to wipe my memory and play it again for the first time. It is a game like no other, and it will test you in more ways than one. Just don't get discouraged when you hit a wall.. because we've ALL been there... all you have to do is learn to overcome it. Once you do, I promise there is no greater feeling in all of gaming.",1708672424,1708672424,True,9,0,0.655172407627105713,0,True,False,False

Compared to dark souls 3, I still think ds3 has better level design and progression. due to elden ring being an open world, the progression can be a little funky depending on the player's exploration. i also think ds3 has higher quality bosses and music(biased becus ds3 dlc fights and music were rlly good). That being said the amount of content that elden ring delivers is insane with so much diverse builds and bosses. It is the bundle of the past and adds a little innovation to keep things fresh. The lore is also just as interesting as fromsoft's other games, its still not given to us directly but its much easily digested than the souls lore. This game is also easier overall imo, only being quite challenging if the boss's resistances directly counters the build you play. 

If you are new, it definitely took a while for me to get adjusted to the genre, but it was worth it. No reason to refund over margit, go explore a bit, raise some stats and practice dodging. I dont even pass most boss's vigor checks and its very doable, even easier on solo imo.

This is the first time I ever played Elden Ring (at the time of writing this review). The reason why I’m giving negative is because of a boss called ""Malenia, Blade of Miquella"". I have died about 60-70 times to this single boss. (I know a lot of people died even more times but for me, this is the threshold)

I tried parry, dodge, shield, spears, fast weapons, strong weapons, freeze, blood loss.... basically, anything reasonable. I can still only reach Phase 2 after every 10-12 deaths, just to die from her special attack. (I have spent about 10 hours fighting THIS single boss) At first, I said to myself: ""Well, well, well... this is a challenging boss!"" Then it became really annoying for a long-long time....

And now this is the point where I become bored by this single boss fight.

Don't get me wrong, I still find the rest of the game amazing but when they created Malenia, they really didn't think it through. It feels like they just wanted to do something CRAZY OP boss but they ended up creating a boring one for first time players, which kind of ruins the whole experience.

I’m hoping they might change her just a tiny-tiny bit. (No major change is needed, just tiny tweaks to make it more First Timer Friendly IMO)",1700517207,1708640530,True,0,0,0.405529975891113281,0,True,False,False

so after a year of playing this game I don't think this game is that bad. the bosses are re-used a lot but after taking a lot of time learning the boss movesets in this game it just comes down to ""they changed the attack patterns."" the enemies in this game read your inputs, other souls game did this to a smaller degree but its why this game was so hard for everyone in the beginning, because the enemies are programmed differently from the get-go which is not necessarily a good thing.
I am leaving the original unedited review from the month the game was released for historical purposes only and because I think its funny. this review was initially not recommended and I still think the majority of the enemies in this game are hot garbage and not programmed to be challenging but instead just to screw with you in as many ways as possible. this game is better than DS3 but that's not really saying much. it feels like a more complete version of ds3 if anything, but atleast it tried to be a little bit different whilst not making the entire game look like old semen residue. 
there are some things I still agree with in my original review but a lot of it is completely false and just me going through the 5 stages of grief in regards to the enemies input reading and me still trying to learn how to abuse and counter it.

if you still wanna read the original review just keep reading, otherwise I recommend it. it was made during a different era in the game before they nerfed certain enemies/bosses, changed boss attack patterns and before they nerfed casting/summoning ashes. pvp also was just terrible but atleast it gave invaders options to legitimately annihilate the host which I support entirely (there was essentially zero downscaling for weapons and spells for pvp so everyone was dying in 3 seconds).





--- written march 7th or 8th or whatever something in 2022 ---

game looks great, has a lot of content, lot of armor and weapons. players have a lot more opportunities for builds and character customization. voice acting is great, art design is great and the combat is more fun than ds3
but of course, you must be asking why is this a negative review. and if you have already played this game, you might have a clue why.

because every boss, most if not all especially in the late game, is broken. not broken as in glitchy, or buggy, just flat out untested and unfair to fight which I must say very carefully, (and sometimes actually bugged). most other titles in the series you learned the movesets in tandem with your frame rate, stuck it out and delivered damage during the recovery phase. 
2/3rds of the bosses/enemies in this game have no recovery phase, what does this mean you ask? it means you will be constantly running away from an enemy that never stops attacking. this, in combination with the mathematically perfect and infallible constant tracking every enemy does means that unless you timed your very small i-frame roll correctly to the dot, at the right location and distance depending on your luck regarding enemy AI, you will lose atleast 1/3rd if not all of your health in one swing/stunlock combo regardless of your armor. this wouldn't be so bad if 2/3rds of the enemies and bosses in this game did not lunge and leap at you like a demented and deranged wasp with heat seeking capabilities.
there are some bosses in this game that are quite definitively impossible for pure melee builds, especially on the strength side. this is not to say all are impossible, some you just have to get used to the ridiculous attack patterns, but you will know almost immediately which ones I am talking about. you cannot beat these specific bosses without either
A. overleveling your character to oblivion
B. summoning, or getting a friend
C. using overscaled sorceries and buffs to one shot the entire game while the boss is distracted

having all these insanely unfair scenarios wouldn't be so bad if it didn't force you into playing a single, mind-numbingly boring playstyle, being the wimpy summoner sidekick if you're not a caster. games like this are meant to be played solo I am pretty sure? I don't recall having to summon fifteen wolves or a copy of myself with 6x the health to beat a goblin man with a serrated pogostick in demon souls. but of course they knew what they were doing for when the game's population inevitably dies some 5 or so years from now when they added in the ash summons and nobody is available for coop.


I can say without the shadow of a doubt that a no hit run can never be achieved in this game
a theory is that miyazaki saw all those funny little streams of people beating the game with a broken straight sword, never getting hit or using throwables, and took a deep and personal offense.
this is not dark souls, this is ""summoning your friends to gank the boss"" souls and you wont get a more clear answer than that seeing as I have played and beaten demon souls to ds3 multiple times without ever having summoned someone to help since I first started ds1. 
I have never thought so negatively of a souls title since I first played a game like this in 2012 with prepare to die edition. this game gets incredibly boring and tedious to play in the later game, once you have fought one boss you have fought them all. the results of this is a rather unappealing and unrewarding back and forth of bosses that are essentially minutes away from eachother, all of which have near identical behaviors. even learning the bosses, and soloing most of them with zero backup feels meaningless when you realize you're just going to have to keep fighting the same boss over and over again with differently timed delayed attacks mixed with 2-4 frame hitscan animations and constant area-of-effect bombardments to artificially introduce a sense of difficulty. did I mention second phases/healthbars? dont you worry about that, there are few bosses without.

PVP, on another note, is also very lackluster. it's in marching formation with bloodborne, being that only people who have summoned atleast one other are susceptible to invasion. this results in boring back and forth attrition warfare if one or the others have not min-maxed their builds to being overpowered with one-two shot capabilities; this is also essentially impossible without bleed/frost due to the combination of weapon and level scaling.

I have beaten this game, and created another character up until the last 2 bosses to test just how bad colossal weapons are which I used in my first, and this is so far my least favorite souls game. it's entirely due to the enemies and bosses. the common theory is they spent too much time developing the world than they did fighting their own monsters. if you think where are you are isn't bad, just wait until the later portions of the game; tree sentinel and margit are cake walks by comparison. getting mad at these bosses assumes that one knows they have a chance at winning, most of the time I am just getting more bored and miserable. you don't learn anything from these bosses, you don't get any better at the game, you just memorize a singular attack pattern and get used to the RNG. I got no satisfaction from any of these bosses outside the first few when they were new to me, not realizing what would later come (or wouldn't come). there are a few bosses that are interesting visually such as radahn, but that's as much credit as I will give them. 

unlike most other souls games, I have no desire to continue past beating the main game and occasionally helping others via summon. I don't think I am going to return to this one for awhile as I have no desire to be a caster and do the same thing over and over again, or use another melee build because i've already done that multiple times in much more rewarding titles.

oh also, good luck if your computer isn't up to par with the insane hardware requirements",1646714021,1708635957,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,7,True,False,False

I find Elden Ring to be more accessible than previous titles because of the open world design. If you ever hit a difficulty wall in one dungeon, you can easily go somewhere else and spend 12 hours or more concurring different challenges before ever needing to return to where you hit that wall. This is also a masterclass in utilizing minimal HUD and map markers while rewarding thorough exploration. I've likely played nearly 400hrs between PS4 and now PC versions, and I still find new stuff in every play through. If you've ever been interested in FromSoft's Souls games but were nervous about the difficulty curve, this one is a great starting point. That said, the game is still incredibly challenging, demanding patience and perseverance to overcome most/all major bosses. In my opinion, the open design, with little to no bottlenecks, actually allowed FromSoft to make bosses harder than ever before in terms of move set complexity, player animation reading, and overall aggression. So it's no walk in the park, but again, with patience and proper strategy all challenges are manageable. Highly recommend!!",1708633805,1708633805,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But sadly exploration is just like in any other open world. You will explore land to its fullest for the first time to find interesting places, secrets and to get loot but in NG+ you will have no reason to do it all again and you will get bored of exploration.

Ambient music is much better than in previous DS games. Voice acting is good to.

NPCs that you find in the world are all interesting.
Almost all of them have a quest or is some way connected to some quest.
But this can also be double-edged sword some times. In order to complete quests successfully some NPCs quests demands certain steps that must be made in specific order or it can fail.

Horse is great in battle.
But not all battles are suited for fighting on horse back to. So be careful in what battle you use it.
When it comes to platforming with horse...well here its not so great at least on K+M.

Now for my main reasons why I gave this game negative review:

Boss fights: A lot of them feel unbalanced.
It also feels very cheap when its two bosses on one player. Well there's a lot of gank bosses this time but most of them are optional or allows you to summon spirits.
Bosses have disgustingly large HP pool especially towards the end of the game. This makes even simple boss fights to drag on (especially if you're fighting with large slow hitting weapons).
Seriously most annoying fights in this game are gank bosses especially if they are already hard to deal even if fighting separately. It is just cheap difficulty for the sake of difficulty.

When it comes to general combat with no horse well here it depends on your build and to know when to attack and when to be on defence. Some builds handle some situations better than others. It was always like this in every DS game.
But this time around I don't know. Some times fighting just seems off somehow.
The controls in this game just do not feel very responsive like they did in other DS games and personally I think enemies lack fair openings.
There are a lot more long spamming combos.
A lot enemies and some bosses can cancel their own recovery faster and so making slow weapons or guard counters useless and make some builds really struggle.
You literally get the feeling that they came from Sekiro fast combat style game.
Do not get me wrong I played Sekiro and all other DS games solo and love them.
Still somehow this one seems off with combat.

Co-op PvE is bad:

In DS1, 2 and 3 you could get summon signs or been summoned almost at any bonfire as long as you stick to community character lvl for Co-op.
But this time in ER forget it.
The only summoning signs or being summoned for Co-op that I have seen and experienced was at the boss fog gate or if you play with password (with a friend from your Steam friends list).
Random coop is almost gone in this game thanks to world being so large this time and no one wanna Co-op out of Legacy Dungeons in open world because it just take to damn long to get anywhere on foot with out a horse (you can't use horse when in Co-op or PvP).

PvP is bad:

Almost everyone goes to YouTube and finds same most OP condition build there is and use it. So don't be surprised if you see a lot of katana edge lord PvP.
PvP was always a shit show in DS series but it was at least entertaining. This time it's just boring and annoying since almost everyone uses same OP build.

Catacombs. Boring and forgettable dungeons.
Dungeon that you can find and explore but visually they all look the same just different dungeon layout and only good to visit once to get the loot and never again in NG+.

PC optimisation: it is bad. Stuttering, FPS drops and PC crashing.
This developers can make great games but they know crap about optimisation. You would think they have learned something by now after making so many DS style games but no.
Really a shame.

DLC: Hahaha they want 40 euros for DLC. Fuck no.

Elden Ring is a good game but after more than 100h in the game I must say that I like the size of the world, exploration and combat like in Dark Souls 3 and Sekiro more and those two games will stay my favorite Soul games.",1645820270,1708628360,False,3,0,0.513513505458831787,0,True,False,False

me and my friends muse together about how resplendent thoust game is:
""I would have spent twice fold for the work of thy art this is""

in the realm of digital wonders, there exists a masterpiece crafted with the finesse of a seasoned bard and the ingenuity of a master smith. 'Tis none other than ""Elden Ring,"" a game that doth transcend the bounds of mere entertainment and ascend to the lofty heights of artistic brilliance. Verily, in its beauty lies not only visual splendor but also the power to stir the soul and kindle the fires of inspiration.

Behold, as thou venture forth into the expanse of the Lands Between, a world wrought with myth and  majesty, where the very fabric of reality is woven with threads of wonder. Each vista, each crevice, is imbued with a sublime grandeur that doth enrapture the senses and transport the weary traveler to realms unknown. From verdant forests to desolate ruins, from towering citadels to forsaken tombs, every corner of this realm resonates with a haunting beauty that doth linger in the mind long after the controller is laid to rest.

But 'tis not merely the visual splendor that sets ""Elden Ring"" apart, for within its labyrinthine depths lies a narrative of profound depth and complexity. Through the tales of heroes and villains, gods and mortals, the game weaves a tapestry of myth and legend that speaks to the very essence of the human experience. 'Tis a story of struggle and triumph, of loss and redemption, that doth resonate with the deepest recesses of the soul.

Yet, perhaps the true beauty of ""Elden Ring"" lies not in its landscapes or its lore, but in the profound impact it hath upon the spirit of the player. For in the face of adversity, in the midst of countless defeats and setbacks, the game doth teach a valuable lesson: perseverance in the face of adversity. As the player battles through hordes of foes and overcomes seemingly insurmountable obstacles, they come to realize that no challenge is too great, no obstacle too daunting, if one but has the courage to press on.

And so, as the final credits roll and the journey comes to an end, the player is left not only with memories of a remarkable adventure but also with a newfound sense of purpose and determination. For ""Elden Ring,"" in all its beauty and complexity, hath the power to inspire and uplift the spirit, to kindle the flames of ambition and drive one to strive for greatness in all endeavors.

In conclusion, 'tis clear that ""Elden Ring"" is more than just a game; it is a work of art that doth resonate with the soul and stir the heart. Through its breathtaking beauty, its captivating narrative, and its profound message of perseverance, it hath the power to uplift the spirit and inspire greatness in all who dare to embark upon its journey. Truly, 'tis a testament to the transformative power of art and a reminder of the boundless potential that lies within us all.

[b]Is this game just Open World Dark Souls?[/b]

Not really. While some aspects are still there, like the way your character controls, it all has been enhanced and made better!

+ Open world is not just empty like Ubisoft gameworlds, There is always something to find, like some material or enemy encampment and even small dungeons and more.

+ There are big and small dungeons, the small ones have some interesting items in them and sometimes may become your go to place for farming crafting materials (if you use a lot of certain crafted items like special arrow-types or bombs), you will get a unique item for defeating a boss in most cases. The big dungeons or overworld dungeons have the important bosses that are directly related to the lore and are not ""just"" sidenotes to the lore. Also openworld bosses are thing, have fun running into them! Also some may appear only at certain times!

+ You have a lot of weapon options which can be enhanced using ashes of war (weapon arts > special attacks) and can be made to scale with certain stats, not all weapon can be used for that > some are set.

- I am going to note here that there is a lack of ashes of war and standard weapons that scale in certain statcombination like: Intelligence & faith (if you have a deathmagic-sorcerer for example), faith or intelligence & arcane.

Arcane is a stat that increases buildup of status effects but you are fairly limited with how it scales, having a blood-infused weapon for example you scale with Dex and Arcane > your bleed-buildup will go up if you level Arcane.

But if you have a character that uses faith + arcane there is no buff to innate bleed-buildup on weapons when you make them scale with faith and you have high arcane. Which is fairly limiting and the same goes for my other examples. There is no way to make a weapon scale with intelligence and faith, except it is innate (infusion usually reduces other scaling by a lot...), but there is only one staff (not weapon) that has both. There are weapons which are infusable and have either faith or int scaling on them... Please add more or:

I hope they will add death ashes of war or if balancing that status effect for PvP is to hard (mild spoiler: [spoiler] it causes insta-death[/spoiler] ) they just can add magic+fire scaling and reduce physical-scaling for that weapon > certainly more interesting than what we have.

Int + Arc should be able to scale for frost-buildup, even on spells! Maybe add a staff that allows that? There is one that has bleed-buildup but it doesnt have that many spells, but at least it scales its bleed-buildup onto the blood-spells!

+ Talismans (basically rings from DS 1-3) can add a lot to your character

Useful if you keep your character at the meta level most people play at > its 150
> for example you can use talismans to add some stats like +5 dexterity and there are talismans like that for every damage stat (and also some others and Great Runes as well, dont sleep on those, they drop from main bosses).

Thing is the dex one has a variant that adds more positive effects on top of it... but there are none for the other types. I hope they will come with the DLC or I will be disappointed, it is quite the advantage to have an attack and a stat boost like that on an item.

+ Very little handholding, you just go and explore and find stuff yourself which is very rewarding gameplay > there also [b]is[/b] stuff to find, take note openworld-devs!

+ Difficulty: This game is not hard if you have a funtioning brain, there are spirit-summons which make the game easier and cartain playstyles allow for an even easier, although more boring, experience (Heavy shield or poison / rot and simply waiting).

Coop is readily available via a craftable consumable of which the components are just around everywhere. PvP is not forced upon you in Singleplayer and in Coop you can rely on Special Player Summons that come and help you get rid of the evil red invaders :P

A tiny negative here is that Coop stops you from using your horse and you can not fully stick together, you need to resummon people in new areas.

+ Oh yeah this game gives you a mount, which is very fun to use! You can even perform combat from horseback and you can build your character to get a bonus to attack while on horseback. Cant use shields thou > except for smacking a fool. The horse has its own healthbar and you might need to spend a flask of your own healing revive it immediatly in combat. Cant be used in coop/invasions.

+ Game runs great [u]without[/u] ray-tracing on. With it on it has framerate issues, at least for me. There are minor framelosses in some more vertical / busy areas and only for a short amount of time, otherwise the game runs superb.

+ Amazing story, find it for yourself. You can find lore anywhere even on the most mundane little items > check their descriptions!

Big DLC has been announced! Cant wait, just 100% the game! Please consider more character-slots, 10 isnt enough!",1646909293,1708624421,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's hard to have new expectations for games to come after this masterpiece. I love how I always can go back and play a new character, with a new build, and explore new dungeons I didn't even know about before. Especially when you find a new secret boss who rocks you (Dragon with double laser beam?! = new fear unlocked).

The only thing I'm excited for these days in the gaming industry, is the DLC.

I bought this game on sale and I feel like I've cheated the developers because of how much content this masterpiece has.
This game is HUGE - The Lands Between is a sprawling, interconnected expanse that beckon exploration at every turn. Thinking back on my play-through, there have been so many memorable, unique experiences that makes the game feel like an actual adventure. I found myself blown away numerous times at just how beautiful the diverse areas and landscapes can be. Because there are no quest markers, I found myself looking up online guides from time to time, but that's not necessarily a bad thing- I prefer it this way honestly.

The combat is nothing short of exhilarating (especially when I'm carrying a plethora of runes) - Elden Ring doesn't hold your hand; it challenges you to adapt and overcome, rewarding perseverance with a sense of accomplishment as you trek through The Lands Between slaying an incredibly creative cast of enemies.

In conclusion, Elden Ring is an essential experience for anyone seeking adventure, challenge, and a touch of extraordinary.

The lock on is very finicky and if you can't see the center of mass on a human-sized npc your character just forgets where they are, some large enemies don't cooperate with the terrain very well making it difficult to hit some of them if they aren't clipping through the floor completely.

Update 1: After more than 350 hours, it's a wonderful game. Full of content and places to explore, equipment to play with and builds to try.

Already excited for DLC and I haven't even finished all of what is available.
Update 2: Now more than 1,000 hours in. PVP is phenomenal at this point. I play at lv 137 so I can fight 125 and 150. It's a ton of fun. The balances the Devs have brought are 95% fantastic. Love the vast majority of what has been updated.
Update 3: currently doing a level 1 challenge run, trying to collect every weapon, armor, trinket spell etc in one run. Only on my 4th area so fare, but feeling amazing. Still doing PvP as well. Level 1 run is making me far better at PvP. These dodge and parry skills are getting fantastic. Also, Shadow of the Erdtree trailer dropped. F#CK YEAH! Cannot wait.

[strike]HOWEVER

The PC port is absolutely terrible. It is obvious they put no consideration into making it user friendly for PC players.

Stuttering and frame time drops when fighting every boss, which apart from the visual annoyance makes fighting the boss harder (than it already is) as it throws off all your timings for dodges and attacks.

The movement controls are janky with mouse and keyboard, causing situations where you just cant face an enemy to hit them a lot of the time.

All the controls are still designed as if you have a controller and its limitations. You cant map items to certain keys, have a quick heal key or assign spells to keys. You have to use it as if you have a D pad which is ridiculous. Also the mapping options are incredibly limited and some things just cant be remapped.

All the menu controls are still in Xbox controller format and there is no list which controller button is mapped to what key and you cant custom map them.... its so bloody stupid. I still have no idea what half of them are and I've been playing for 16 hours! Their fix for this is to right click on the menu screen to bring up a drop down list that lets you choose what controller button you want to press.... Its incredibly annoying and frustrating. I dread having to go into my inventories or equipment screens cause its so badly designed.

Speaking of going into those screens, to access the menu to select aforementioned screens you have to press escape... there are no hotkeys for inventory, equipment, crafting etc etc. having to take your hand off they keyboard to press escape every time is also, you guessed it.... annoying.

Until they fix these obvious issues, I cant in good conscience give it a positive score. Odds are you will like this game, but the UI will drive you insane.[/strike]

With these types of games, simply take everything you thought you knew about difficulty and bosses and throw it out the window. Like how bosses in this game have a plethora of attacks and aren't artificially inflated in difficulty (obsurd damage sponge healthbars, and enemy damage multipliers, hoards of enemies). Enemies and Areas are carefully designed, in a way that makes the difficulty of souls games unique. Elden ring isn't gonna hold your hand and tell you where to go, how to dodge some attacks, that's for you to do. It's a big part of the game to simply explore and find new things, be it new structures, mythical creatures or legendary artifacts. The main goal isn't just depleting the bosses health bar to 0 through any means, It's that satisfying feeling of accomplishment of overcoming a challenge that you yourself learned how to overcome. Majority of the difficulty in these games come from the learning curve. A boss with attacks that seemed impossible avoid at first, is trivial the 2nd time around. There's always a trick to every boss, like the delaying dodges, the direction to dodge to avoid certain attacks and weaknesses. Some may say the gameplay is trail and error and tedious. That of which are simply incorrect, as you can learn from your past attempt what to do and what NOT to do in that boss, rather than mindlessly trying again till you survive by luck. But, if you're trying over and over again and are simply stuck (lacking damage, getting one shot because underleveled), just leave and come back. Thats the thing with elden ring being open world, you aren't locked to one area in order to progress. There's always multiple exploration paths to take leading to different items to find, enemies and bosses to defeat, ultimately become stronger. If you really are stuck or just impatient, you could use assists like npc/cooperator/spirit summons or really cheesy strats. (takes the fun out the game, makes it as easy as just watching a video of someone else play) but it may help you in getting hands-on a sense of the game and mechanics as a casual or someone new to the genre. Also consider not spoiling your playthrough like the boss phases (so it doesn't ruin the suprise factor) or bosses names, which its basically like saying this movie character dies in this movie because you kill the bosses eventually. So try to keep youtube/wiki searches to a minimum or at least spoiler free (ruins the first time experience IMO). In addition, you should also have some motivation to progress, like wanting to see the new areas, beat all the bosses or making new builds, which is a huge part of this game. Without motivation, its hard to persevere through difficult sections of the game without wanting to simply quit. Some say replay value is lacking, I disagree. Elden ring is one of the more replayable souls games, most of which coming from Online CO-OP and PVP through invasions or 1v1 colosseum duels. Overall Elden ring is a fun and rewarding experience, and enough content to be worth full price.

However, if you are not into action RPGs or dislike mythical/fantasy themed worlds and enemies then this game might simply not be of interest for you. One thing to note, this isn't a storytelling game. Don't expect a god of war level narrative with cinematic button sequence cutscenes, just stick to the EA/Rockstar/Sony productions story games.",1673754105,1708583871,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Instant negative review. I refuse to support scummy business practices; as if they had to try one-upping Capcom for trying to silently place in Deck-breaking DRM into their titles.

I enjoyed my time with the base game, but this is an absolute bloody joke, and flatly gouging people's wallets because they're banking on hype and their IP.

With Shadow of the Erd Tree having just been announced, so were the eye-popping prices, on top of one gigantic F-you to all players who already own the game.

Already have Elden Ring and wanna get the DLC? That'll be $60AUD.

Never bought it? That's okay, here's [b]50% off the DLC if you buy both.[/b]

So why even charge $60 if the [i]actual[/i] price is $30, FromSoft? The developers clearly think whatever content's coming is worth far less than what they're asking of people who already own the game.

Dripping with uniqueness in the open-world genre. Amazing exploration, world building, weapon diversity and obviously combat. Only flaw in my opinion are the quests, they are beyond vague and will almost definitely require that you look up guides to complete. But unlike other open-world rpgs,, quests aren't all that important as most of the story is told through world building and boss encounters.

Released amid immense anticipation, Elden Ring transcends expectations, offering a boundless world ripe for exploration, formidable challenges that test the limits of players' skills, and a depth of customization that empowers every adventurer.

At the heart of Elden Ring lies its unparalleled sense of exploration. From the moment you step foot into the Lands Between, the game beckons you with a sprawling, seamless open world that teems with secrets, mysteries, and untold dangers. Every corner of this vast expanse holds treasures to uncover, ruins to explore, and adversaries to overcome. The freedom afforded to players is staggering, as they chart their own course through dense forests, towering mountains, and forsaken dungeons. The dynamic day-night cycle and weather system add layers of immersion, transforming the landscape with each passing moment and presenting new challenges and discoveries at every turn. Whether on foot or astride a majestic steed, the journey through Elden Ring's world is nothing short of breathtaking.

Yet, with great exploration comes great peril, and Elden Ring delivers in spades on the front of challenge. From the lowliest grunt to the mightiest demigod, every foe poses a genuine threat, demanding precision, strategy, and adaptability. Combat is a visceral dance of life and death, requiring mastery of timing, positioning, and the intricate interplay of weapons, magic, and abilities. Each encounter is a test of mettle, rewarding those who dare to face adversity with triumph and growth. The sense of accomplishment that comes from vanquishing a daunting boss or conquering a treacherous dungeon is unparalleled, a testament to the game's finely tuned difficulty curve and impeccable design.

Moreover, Elden Ring's depth of customization is nothing short of astonishing. From the creation of your own bespoke character to the myriad weapons, spells, and abilities at your disposal, the game offers near-limitless possibilities for self-expression and playstyle refinement. Whether you prefer to wield a massive greatsword with devastating power or harness the arcane arts to bend reality to your will, the choice is yours to make. The intricate skill tree system allows for unprecedented depth and specialization, empowering players to tailor their character to suit their individual preferences and strengths. The sheer breadth of options ensures that no two adventurers' journeys are ever alike, fostering a sense of personal investment and ownership over the unfolding narrative.

In conclusion, Elden Ring stands as a crowning achievement in the annals of gaming history, a tour de force that exemplifies the very best of what the medium has to offer. With its awe-inspiring exploration, exhilarating challenge, and boundless customization, it sets a new standard for the genre and reaffirms FromSoftware's status as visionary trailblazers.

[h3]Introduction[/h3]
I'll be completely honest with you - I've never been all that interested in FromSoftware's games or the ""Souls-like"" genre in general. With how infamously difficult these games supposedly were and with how obnoxious ""git gud"" attitude from the fanbase, I pretty much wrote it all off as just a niche genre that simply wasn't for me. So, you can imagine how skeptical I was when the first Elden Ring gameplay trailer dropped. Everything about it looked awesome, and with a highly regarded author as George R.R. Martin commisioned to pen this new world, I was intrigued but cautiously optimistic.
I bought the game just a few hours before it launched back in February of 2022 and was thorougly impressed with what I had played in those initial 20+ hours. Truth be told, my time with Elden Ring didn't last too long. At the time, I was focused on Dying Light 2, which had just released earlier that month, and with ""gamer ADD"" making it difficult to focus on Elden Ring, I didn't get too far in my playthrough. However, with the upcoming [i]Shadow of the Erdtree[/i] expansion finally set to release in June, I decided to finally get back into Elden Ring and continue on from my initial playthrough. I did start a second playthrough a while ago but have since returned to my first playthrough as of writing this review. So far, I have only just defeated Godrick, so most of this review will mainly just be based off of my experience up to that point. Here is my review of [i]Elden Ring[/i].

[h3]A Breathtaking Fantasy World[/h3]
Elden Ring has one of the most visually breathtaking open worlds ever made, full of vast landscapes and mindblowing discoveries to be made. So far, I've only just made it to Liurnia of the Lakes, but I feel like I've already seen so much. By far, the most mindblowing moment in my time playing Elden Ring has to be when I first entered Siofra River for the first time. Discovering this area on my own with no prior knowledge of its existence is what makes Elden Ring one of the most impressive open world games ever. I can only imagine what the rest of the game has hidden in its world, and I can't wait to find out. 
Elden Ring has no shortage of breathtaking landscapes and secrets to discover, but it also has a world filled with history and lore, all of which was penned by [i]Game of Thrones[/i] author George R.R. Martin. The worldbulding of Elden Ring is very enigmatic in nature, with a keen focus on letting the player piece it together themselves through conversations with NPC's, item descriptions, and environmental storytelling. As much as I love and appreciate the cinematic storytelling of games like [i]Red Dead Redemption 2[/i] and [i]The Last of Us[/i], I much prefer FromSoftware's approach to storytelling and worldbuilding by letting the player figure it out for themselves. 

[h3]Larger Than Life Characters[/h3]
Within this vast fantasy world lies a large assortment of creatures and characters that stand out from most works of fantasy. Whether it's a herd of goats that literally roll away from you when you get to close or a giant walking rock with a bell tower on top of it, Elden Ring has no shortage of bizzare and imaginitive creatures to come across. What makes these characters and the bosses you fight throughout the game so grand and spectacular is the sheer scale of these creatures. It's hard to describe, but the way Elden Ring makes your character feel small and insignificant when compared to the bigger, more intimidating-looking creatures is done in a way that I find very impressive. Elden Ring has the coolest character designs I've seen for any fantasy game and it's not even close. 

[h3]An Epic Fantasy Soundtrack[/h3]
Music has always been a core part of any fantasy game - Without it, these worlds, their lore and the overall experience would feel weightless and not as exciting. Elden Ring's score is just perfect and complements the world and it's scope. The score feels very reminiscent to [i]The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind[/i] with how mysterious and alien the world feels, especially when compared to most fantasy games. The different regions in Elden Ring are presented with a dark and dreary tone and atmosphere, complemented heavily by the ambient score that plays as you explore each region. FromSoftware have done a masterful job at creating an immersive fantasy world that feels just as distinct as it is epic. 

[h3]Engaging Combat & Gameplay Loop[/h3]
It's one thing to have an impressive-looking world and boss fights, with epic music to go with it, but if the gameplay isn't complementary, then it won't mean much in the long run. If there is one thing that FromSoftware are great at, it's the gameplay loop that's at the core of every Souls-like game. The gameplay loop of Elden Ring, as with seemingly the rest of FromSoftware's games, is a lot of fun and very satisfying. Unlike in many other games, you can't just simply cheese through each of the game's different boss fights. In order to effectively defeat the many bosses present within the game's world, you must level up your character and carefully choose which attributes you'd like to rank up and specialize in. Not only must you level up your character, but you'll have to account for the various abilities and moves each boss has and learn how to properly defeat them through trial and error. This is what makes boss fights in Elden Ring, as with the ""Souls-like"" genre as a whole, so special. Instead of heavily-scripted, movie-like boss fights, FromSoftware puts gameplay at the forefront of the experience while still maintaining that cinematic flair, just without the smoke and mirrors. 

[h3]Conclusion[/h3]
I still have a long journey ahead of me in Elden Ring and I'm sure there's a lot more to say that I haven't already said in this review, but I'm confident that this game will remain just as phenomenal as it currently is in my playthrough. Like I said, I used to avoid these types of games for their harsh difficulty, but after playing this game, I finally get it. While Elden Ring and the ""Souls-like"" genre may appeal mostly to a certain type of player, I still strongly recommend Elden Ring to anyone looking for a new game and world to get lost in.",1708562925,1708563731,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Art : 11/10 I think its art style and graphics make it the best looking game out there.
Difficulty: Not as hard as people say, sure you'll die but you'll never be stuck on a boss forever and beating it just adds to the enjoyment.
Variety: The amount of weapons, armor pieces, talismans, and potions in this game is absurd in a good way. You could play it 50 times over and still have a new build. On top of that, the weapons and armor in this game are so well designed artistically and fun to use as well.
Story: The story isn't quite Red Dead or Last of Us in terms of pulling at heart string or character development but the world that is constructed is so well done especially if you can piece it up all on your own.

It struggles with recycled content and feeling dragged out towards the end, like most open world games tend to do, but despite that I still didn't want it to end. The world they've built and the some of the bosses you come across were challenging enough to be memorable, while others felt so out of place and terribly balanced/tedious (the numerous duo fights were shockingly bad considering the same devs made the O&S fight in Ds1).
It would be unfair comparing it directly to DS3 considering the pacing will always be worse with open world games so I'll leave it at that.

Overall I can't say it beat bloodborne for the best FS game in my eyes, it's a tie with DS3 for second as the music and boss design in that game is outstanding; great effort for their first open world game and I hope it has an effect on future open world games just as BOTW did but a part of me hopes fromsoftware goes back to their beautifully paced, tightly knit style of gameplay.",1646132842,1708559511,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Update:

Still negative. Needs a patch bad for reasons too many to mention here. That and im a lazy boi. Yes. Its fun when it works though so im pretty hopeful. This game is punishment in more ways than one. Where have the hours gone tarnished?

Update2:

Playing the game and the world opens up more which is nice. Multiplayer in the overland world is still broken as my friends can only play in  local dungeons now. Waiting for a patch so this game wont seem like such a skabb.

Update 3:

Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon Boss Fight BROKEN in coop

This game just keeps on giving.

Update 4: Outside of a few annoying posts made on this review, the game seems to offer deep lore with the store line, although there are a few story arc's that do not make any sense whatsoever, it seems okayish. Multiplayer issues still persist, more so connection drops during summoned boss fights. This game makes you want to touch grass.

This game is:

• Dark Souls on steroids with a vast open world where everything wants to murder you.
• Horse combat that's: 50% epic, 50% accidentally jumping off cliffs because ""Torrent, no!"".
• Bosses that: Range from majestic demigods to giant crabs with PTSD. Prepare to die a lot.

But hey, at least:

• You can dress like a walking pot. Fashion Souls is alive and well, even if your character isn't.
• You can summon help... who promptly gets mauled by a dog the size of a house.
• You can learn magic... and accidentally nuke yourself in the face.
• You can explore a vast, gorgeous world... filled with things that want to end your existence.

Recommended if you:

• Enjoy pain 👍
• Have a masochistic streak higher than the Erdtree.
• Enjoy scenic views... of your own demise.
• Want someone to finally hug you (I mean bear, not that blessing girl).

It might not be for you if you:

• Have a weak heart (or controller).
• Can't handle women with more than 2 arms.
• Don't want to develop an emotional connection with your kitchenware and start calling it ""Alexander"".
• Value your sanity (or at least your furniture).

Overall:

Holy Miquella, this game is gorgeous! Elden Ring is a masterpiece of pain, beauty, and absurdity with a difficulty curve so steep, you'll need a Sherpa. Elden Ring is like getting punched in the face by a beautiful angel while riding a runaway horse. It hurts, but you can't look away because you love it.

P.S. Please send help. I'm stuck in a swamp surrounded by crabs and I think Torrent is plotting against me.

P.P.S. 11/10 would recommend, also would need therapy after.

Instead of a tightly designed game like Dark Souls 1 and 3, where every squared cm has meticulously designed, where you have a well thought out difficulty curve and you can get in a completely different feeling area in minutes, you're wandering around in a mostly empty sea of grass with a lot of procedural generation going on.

The only time I had fun was when I was in a castle which actually felt like a well thought out experience.

Then I ran into the first boss where I died 5 times without making a dent in his health bar. When that happened in Dark Souls, I would explore a little while leveling up or it would have been obvious it was time to beat it, but not here. Also, where would I explore? The world is so overwhelmingly big and not very dense that I have no idea where I would go. It's not like in firelink shrine where you have a few destict paths to choose from.

Maybe I just had to keep going? Maybe I missed something? (I can't summon spirits yet). Maybe I was underleveled? I don't know.

There are hundreds of different builds to make for your character and gives the game a LOT of replayability.
Very Co-op friendly and so much fun to play...

I purchased the game during the last winter sale and played it until I completed it. The hours I invested in the game were definitely worthwhile.[/b]

[h1]I even ask an AI to review it and here's what it said:[/h1]

The game’s vastness, like an uncharted continent, beckoned me to explore every nook and cranny. Each sunrise revealed new secrets, and every moonrise whispered ancient tales.

The combat, reminiscent of FromSoftware’s signature style, demanded precision and resilience. No gentle tutorials here—just raw, unyielding challenges. Yet, with each fallen foe, I felt a surge of accomplishment. The landscapes—towering cliffs, desolate ruins, and mystical forests—were not mere backdrops but characters in their own right. Elden Ring’s sunsets painted the sky with hues I’d never seen before, as if the gods themselves dipped their brushes in cosmic pigments.

And the lore! Oh, the lore. It wove a tapestry of forgotten kingdoms, shattered alliances, and cryptic prophecies. I pored over ancient tablets, deciphering runes, piecing together the tragic saga of the Elden Ring. NPCs, their voices etched with sorrow or madness, shared tales of lost kings, cursed knights, and forbidden magic. I became a scholar, a detective, unraveling the threads that bound this fractured world.

The hours I poured into Elden Ring—like coins tossed into a wishing well—yielded dividends of wonder, frustration, and awe. The thrill of unearthing a hidden shrine, the terror of facing a colossal boss, the quiet solace of gazing at a star-studded sky—all etched into my gaming soul. I emerged from this epic odyssey with battle scars and triumphs, a bard’s song waiting to be sung.

So, yes, it was worth it. Worth every bleary-eyed night, every adrenaline-fueled duel, every whispered prayer for a bonfire. Elden Ring isn’t just a game; it’s a pilgrimage—a journey that reshapes you, leaving imprints on your psyche like runes etched in stone. 🌟🗡️🌄

Feel free to immerse yourself in the echoes of Elden Ring’s lands once more, or perhaps venture forth into another epic quest. 🎮✨

The environments are breathtaking. The combat is fluid. The music hits hard as always. The open world does not hold your hand, but rewards with more game. The only two downsides are major, however. The late game spike in difficulty and damage scaling is immense and can often be overbearing, making the player doubt the idea of 'tough, but fair' as often it is indeed pretty bullshit. The other flaw would be that the world is too big, filled with many inserted copy bosses and lengthy travels with not much happening, as the player rides from one destination to the next, especially after a first playthrough.

Overall, this game is a 10/10 out of pure respect, but a very shaky one. Would not recommend as a first Souls-like.",1708534831,1708534831,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

if you are looking for a game that is linear, holds your hand through every step and doesn't let you stray too far off of the beaten path, this game is not for you.
You can spend Hours going off of the beaten path and exploring the 4 corners of the land between and you will not be short of content. Even the darkest of corners have something to be explored and the sombre atmosphere and lonely expanse adds to effect and engages players to think and connect the dots, it really makes you think 'Why am i here?' 'What is my purpose?' and 'How did this happen?'

After completing the game multiple times, i do have to say, this is by far, my favourite game in recent years, and really makes you wonder.. Whats next?

Exploring massive areas was annoying and also threw the game out of balance - I visited places in the wrong order (which I didn't know at the time) and ended up being overleveled for half the time which sucked the difficulty and fun out of the game. 

Also this game shows light/mid/heavy equip load instead of showing the percentage. Good for new players but overall makes it tedious to calculate what equipment you should use. No reason why it can't show both.
This game did a slightly better job at providing info about game mechanics than previous games but somehow still forgot to mention how dual weilding works. It's a very crucial core mechanic in this game that many people who bitch that the game is too hard don't know about.

And then there's the 2 ever-prevalent problems that exist in almost all fromsoft games: 
1. A weapon upgrade system that forces you to use starting weapons the whole game and makes trying out anything new extremely tedious
2. Camera Reset being on the same key as Target Lock and it can't be disabled. Extremely annoying, no one ever needs this feature, all it does is disorient you when you fail to target lock. Can be fixed super easily but somehow still doesn't think this is a problem after ~15 years.

But it also did a bunch of stuff better than previous games: 
- Consistent animations between one- and two-handed attacks. Dark Souls had some weapons that had much worse 2H attack anims than 1H anims which made no sense. Glad they fixed it.
- Guard counters is a very nice addition for melee users.
- No more superlong boss runbacks
- Actually difficult, challenging lategame bosses instead of punching bags",1645955978,1708530753,True,0,0,0.490463197231292725,0,True,False,False

I'm not normally the kind of guy to say that this or that game is a must-play, but I think anybody out there who appreciates art direction, music composition, or just good general game design needs to give this a shot. Elden Ring was the very first FromSoftware game that I played to completion, mainly due to how free you were to explore from the get-go. If they had forced me to ""git gud"" in order to beat a boss I was stuck on like Dark Souls, I likely wouldn't have kept playing. But the fact that you can leave a hard boss, explore for 20 hours, then come back far stronger and kick their ass is what I live for, and is ultimately what drove me to complete this game for the first time. I soon became so powerful that I managed to beat every boss from Rennala onward without dying a single time, excluding Malenia of course. A lot of players would deem the playstyle of using every tool at your disposal to obliterate everything in the game boring and scummy, but that exact style was probably the most fun I've ever had in a video game. This game allows people with crafty minds to think outside of the box in order to get past obstacles. Sure, you can brute force that huge group of enemies and maybe die a couple of times by getting stunlocked, or you can use ranged weapons to lure them out one by one, or use a bewitching branch to force a powerful enemy to attack the horde, or clump them all together and disintegrate them with a couple powerful spells/weapon arts. These kinds of strategies apply for some bosses, too! If anything in this game is giving you trouble, there's ALWAYS a way around it. Unlike Dark Souls, you don't have to spend 30 minutes to a couple hours ""gitting gud"" by memorizing a boss's repertoire of attacks just to get by. It's helpful, sure, but not the required way to progress. I'm not dissing on Dark Souls' progression system or anything, because it certainly has its many merits as well, but the unbridled freedom of Elden Ring is what really keeps me playing.

With all of that said, I can't recommend this game enough, and with the upcoming DLC in June, this 10/10 game is about to get a whole lot better.",1708530358,1708530358,True,1,0,0.509884655475616455,0,True,False,False

Elden ring has combined these two styles by both providing overwhelming challenges that keep me coming back because they feel like I can do it with one more try while also allowing me to have fun in the game somewhere else if the challenge is too much on any given day. Its difficult combat, amazing visuals, stellar soundtrack, and endless build variety make for hundreds of hours of enjoyable game play and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys realtime combat and open world games.",1708530167,1708530167,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Yet it will test your ability to contain the instinctual urge to break free from the invisible walls of the nightmare. Manifesting as real risk for the physical objects around you while playing... lol

If killing a dragon was ever a display of valor, here you will certainly own it.

There are a few design choices that I don't fully understand but accept. Punishment to the player (specially new players) feels too harsh. Also why there are no real friends (besides your goat horse) or friendly cities? Anyways. This game was meant to be dark place.

Despite the map being technically smaller than games like BG3, GTA5, Skyrim, etc, this game manages to pack so much density of detail into each area that you have no choice but to feel so, unbelievably *small.* The boss designs are also probably the best of Fromsoftware's entire career.                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                                  
The only issues I have with Elden Ring are as follows: the bullshit platforming that adds nothing (save for unnecessary frustration with a skill that should be irrelevant to this genre),  some strange balancing decisions both for boss tunings and spell/weapon scalings, lack of reason to fight after previously exploring an area, and the re-use of multiple bosses & enemies occasionally. The frame drops on the PC port don't help either.

Overall, however; the pros absolutely outweigh the cons of this game. I've sank nearly 150 hours into Elden Ring since I purchased it, and have not even beaten the game yet. This game truly feels like an experience that you should not deprive yourself of, despite some lingering gameplay and technical issues. It brings so much passion and creativity back into the fantasy/RPG genre as a whole, and for that I cannot thank it enough.",1708509472,1708509646,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In the 4 hours I've been playing, it's crashed about 3 times, annoying me enough to write this. Other than that, the game is awesome, just poorly optimized for pc I'd wager (no surprise there given FromSoftware's history with pc ports).

Edit: switched to recommended because they've fixed the crashes apparently. Music is 10/10. Voice acting is one of the best I've ever heard in a FromSoft title. Combat is fluid and, to some extent, intuitive; same thing with Torrent's mechanics (the horse). Many easter eggs and content to look for. I've played over 20 hours and I haven't even beaten the 1st story boss because I've dedicated myself to exploring first. Dungeons are awesome and bring you back to that classic Soulsborne feel aka no horseback fighting or fast travel at any time.

Elden Ring feels like a culmination of effort that FromSoft has been working towards for YEARS. Every previous iteration of the souls games introduced ideas, concepts, and mechanics that are nearly all here, in some way shape or form. Note that I say NEARLY all. 

The first time I played through Elden Ring, it made me fall in love with video games all over again. I was suddenly 8 years old, with no concept of the limitations games have and everything seemed possible. I could go ANYWHERE and find something interesting, be it a unique item, a cool boss, a memorable NPC, or just a gorgeous view (ahead). I spent hours poring over every bit of terrain, figuring out little puzzles, keeping track of what key items I had that I hadn't used yet. Hell, I got out Notepad and made a .txt document of ""to-do's"" for this game just to make sure I didn't miss anything. It was AWESOME.

However, after getting about 3/4ths of the way through some of the cracks started to show. There were repeat bosses. A LOT of repeat bosses. This was something of a disappointment - I was coming hot off of playing through Dark Souls 2 and 3, games with pretty excellent boss variety (especially 3). This partial gripe leads into my biggest gripe: Elden Ring duo bosses are hot garbage. This is because all of the duo bosses are just bosses you would normally fight solo, except they've been placed together in the same arena without much care given to their combat styles or AI patterns. Looking at previous duo bosses like Demon in Pain and Demon from Below in DS3, O&S in DS1, or even Throne Watcher and Throne Defender in DS2, these bosses were all carefully crafted with each half of the duo in mind. This is not the case in Elden Ring, as mentioned above.

So I put aside my issues with the lack of unique bosses and lack of good duo bosses, and finish the game, where I fly off in a magic bathtub with my space princess waifu for a moon vacation. Great! I decide to start NG+, which is where my second issue arises...Elden Ring in NG+ is less of a game and more of a chore.

Due to just how vast Elden Ring is, it's a damn long walk to get from Limgrave (the starting area) to becoming Elden Lord (the final cutscene). This long walk becomes way less fun when you already know whats coming, and when you know what areas aren't necessary to travel to. I believe this severely harms the game's replay value. Let's take a look at one of from's previous entry's and my personal favorite of the trilogy, Dark Souls 3. Dark Souls 3 is very linear which some may criticize, but I believe it serves it well. I love playing through Dark Souls 3 because the level designs are fun, the bosses are really cool and fun to fight, and at any given point I can gauge how far into the game I am based on what area I'm in or what boss I've just defeated. Now, because Elden Ring is an open world game, FromSoft had to take into account players missing out on certain areas (and they trusted themselves enough to make a world worth exploring, without waypoint markers clogging up the map - but I digress). And exploring this open world is amazing!...the first time around. Playing through the game a second time, there's much less incentive to explore because you learned where all the important/good/useful items are, and grabbing anything superfluous would waste time, so you may skip over huge chunks of the map. This sucks because Elden Ring is BEGGING to be explored, and is fun to explore! But only the first time.

Also how many runes (currency) you get from killing enemies is completely borked. I wish it was more like DS2 where you get showered with currency and can level a ton early game but eventually it plateaus later, rather than always only being able to get enough runes to level only once or twice after some bosses.

In summation: Elden Ring is the greatest video game experience you will ever have...but only the first time you play through it. It's flawed, and dropped the ball in some places where previous entries succeeded, but it's a glorious adventure. Go play it.",1708485177,1708485177,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Elden Ring is FromSoft's best game but it's also their worst game, if that makes any sense.  There is HOURS of fun to be had here and you'll without a doubt get your money's worth.  But I did notice a few cracks in it's facade.  A plethora of annoying bosses with ridiculous health bars.  A bizarre and completely disorienting sense of direction. Map exploration that is extremely tedious as the map is so gargantuan it will take up most of your play session.  Critique of this game is so abundant online it's just sad.  I mean, this was supposed to be The Game!  All this I believe has shattered Elden Ring's Great Oracular Bubble and caused it to fall from the heavens, and directly into the clearance bin of your local electronics store.

The game starts off strong with breathtaking visuals, challenge dungeons, open-world exploration, multiplayer co-op and pvp matches- FANTASTIC I love it.  The NPC's have great voice acting and the lore is rich, you know, dry dialogue- the likes of which you've come to expect from these kinds of games.  If you love sleep-inducing dialogue this is your game!  No but seriously, I think Elden RIng's strongest suit is the wide variety of animals and enemy-types in the game.  There's bats, wolves, bears, lions, knights, dragons, skeletons, sorcerers, apparitions, etc.  There's literally something taken from all realms of fantasy here.  FromSoft really went all-out on making sure every enemy encounter was unforgettable.  I commend them on that!  I love fighting the bears they're my personal favorite!  But, lets talk about some of the negative aspects of this game now.

First, Elden Ring is very non-linear.  In order to advance the storyline you'll need to backtrack to areas you already were, scavenge for items that aren't the easiest to find, and exhaust so much NPC dialogue.  Omg, who wants to do that?  Just let me open the damn gate and move to the next area why do I have to go look for shit?  You literally need to have YouTube open on a 2nd monitor so you can look up how to find the next area, because you will NOT figure it out on your own!  The game also gets significantly boring once you reach the ""Liurnia Of The Lakes"" area.  For reals dude, that's where the game completely lost me as a patron.  I'm not a fan of having to explore vast open swamp land, or vast open snow land, or vast open autumn land.  I would have preferred a linear approach.  Keep it simple next time.

THERE'S CLIFFS EVERYWHERE.  Cliffs, rocks, canyons, pitfalls.  The same uneven terrain over and over again with different colored grass.  Was this game made by AI?

The boss fights can be really exhausting.  Seriously, some of these dudes are straight up damage sponges and it becomes a chore really quick.  Commander O'Neill is a perfect example.  It takes a million hits to bring his fatass down, meanwhile he's also summoning apparitions that shoot arrows at you.  NO, I refuse to apply some stupid sorcery or wear some gay ring just to make it easier- I'm a Parry main.  I PARRY.  That's how I fight.  The same goes for sorcery, I'm not going to fight bosses with sorcery that's for noobs!  But in Elden Ring the parry mechanic has been nerfed into oblivion that it's just pointless to use sometimes.  So you either have to go level up first, or do a co-op mission to complete difficult bosses.  Another point I'd like to bring up is the amount of bosses in the game.  There's so many!  It's like they went with quantity over quality.  I would rather they give us fewer bosses that were designed really well, than a bunch of the same dudes who fight just like the last guy.  And to be fair the parry DOES work on a lot of foes, both big and small.  It's not broken or anything, I just wish the parry did more damage than it does.

So in conclusion: Would I recommend Elden Ring?  No.  The fun level drops significantly once you get to Radahn.  At this point you realize Elden Ring is a bait and switch.  Unless you actually enjoy memorizing 10 different attack patterns per boss.  A vast open world of nothingness that makes you feel lonelier than Starfield.  And never getting summoned to re-do your favorite boss fights.  I guess it's because nobody really plays this shit anymore.  Shame.  At least I got it on clearance.",1705910142,1708456055,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The few who aren't against you aren't your allies; no one is your ally. Everyone who appears friendly is merely trying to use you for their own gain, yet using them is what you do as well, for a crown cannot rest upon two brows and the seat of Elden lord must be claimed by you alone.

Open world just makes the game an incredibly tedious chore on repeat playthroughs, and I would rather play any other souls game. The more familiar I have become with the bosses, the more irritating and unfair a lot of them feel, even if I can defeat nearly all of them without a single death. 
A lot of level and dungeon design is just stupid ""gotcha!"" design, which grows more and more into an irritating slog with time. Many areas are just not fun at all, and I question how they made it out of development. 
Playing for so long, and trying so many builds, only highlighted how broken the game balance is. You can either have a complete breeze of a time cheesing everything with OP options, or suffer fighting honestly against extremely cheap enemies and bosses. 
I don't know, maybe games that are based around overcoming hardship for the sake of it, just aren't my bag anymore. The only point in dealing with all the tedious design, is to get that little victory nut, which is a really shallow thing to build an entire game around. 
Ultimately, the first journey and all its discovery was a really fun experience, but that was clearly the only experience the game had in mind.

Art style is one thing I can say that is positive across the board; it looks great, it's detailed and generally clear enough to see what's going on in a fight. There are points where there was clearly intent to make a vista intentionally pleasing.

What really pushed me to not recommend however is the combat and storytelling.

Fighting can rapidly transition toward frustrating due to the 'stickiness' in how enemies move when attacking and how movement during the wind up and swing is treated. The game seems to permit movement of enemy movement and collision from during the windup and attack animations. It seems that the game does an initial lock-on to player location at the start of the wind-up of the attack, and then a second lock on at some point of the attack animation, causing such interesting cases as watching a dive attack suddenly do a U-turn and jump back into your face because you dodged behind an enemy, or watching a model slide forward an extra few feet to ensure an attack lands. Enemies in a chain of attacks will inexplicably have a model rotation that violates the apparent momentum of their swings. This, from my experience, leads to a condition where evasion is more closely tied with making the dodge during the attack swing to use the I-frames and where evading out of enemy reach during the wind up is punished by how the models move. I feel, at times when the combat feels particularly clunky, like a man on crutches trying to waltz with an ice skater. Does it feel fair? Sure, about 70% of the time, but that last 30% really ruins it for me.

I ended up just being incredibly disappointed by the storytelling, which is made even worse by the fact that the actual story behind it is great. Telling large chunks of story, backstory and location history through the flavor text on items, the very rare NPC interaction and the cryptic mutterings and insinuations is actually godawful. There's no ingame codex to collate the massive amount of information on individual items, noted by NPCs, or plot beats we need to get refreshed on between dungeons, no tattered pages on history or politics that we can collect in the land, just assorted cryptic mutterings from NPCs that either get killed off too soon to give us any impactful dialogue or speak in cryptic circles. The rule is to show not tell, but somebody forgot to tell fromsoft that showing is not the same as making vague implications.

Update: 6.5/10, ARPG / Sandbox RPG

TLDR: Lacking in the RPG department and lacks direction. Combat and its difficulty are good (in single-player).

A lack of direction in a sandbox is usually compensated for with immersive RPG elements - the game has to drive you somehow. Whether that means making it story-driven or relying on other design elements.

Hype made the game out to be something it isn't, so I came into Elden Ring expecting a lot more from this ""hardcore open world RPG"" with ""one of the best stories in a game ever,"" ""honestly a masterpiece."" 

I remember being so excited to play after making my character, only to be incredibly disappointed there was no way to RP them. No way to interact with the world, no way to show their personality; nothing. I didn't feel integrated into the world at all.

So I aim to set expectations straight, hopefully saving you some frustration. As among other things, it can feel isolating being, apparently, one of the only people who didn't have fun playing this game.

- Don't buy for multiplayer (unless you want to setup mods)
- Be careful if you come from an RPG/CRPG background
- Has a (potentially [i]long[/i]) time till ""click"" moment. (So I am told anyway, I haven't actually reached that point myself. FromSoft games seem to be designed so the pain of early game makes the end feel more meaningful; you appreciate the struggle. Or maybe that's abuse apologist nonsense. All will be revealed in time, I suppose. Regardless, I feel this transition period is getting into wasting my time territory.)

And a seemingly small gripe I have is the [i]lack of a journal[/i]. How am I supposed to remember the dialog?! This makes the game unplayable for me, but luckily there is a mod for that (ugh). 

FromSoftware clearly wanted to expand their player base (with open world RPG enjoyers), but failed to expand their game accordingly.

On a more positive note, the combat is unique and interesting. Killing and looting is satisfying. Exploring [i]should[/i] be. Min-maxing a build is one of my favorite things to do. I could probably spent 500h on my first playthrough alone, combing through every pixel of the map.

Obviously, this is all based on my experience so far, which is primarily exploring Limgrave: spanking some bears and realizing it's too easy to soft-lock yourself out of basic *disgrunted noises* game mechanics *increasingly disgrunted noises.*

I cannot review the entire game fairly.

Elden Ring is the first FromSoftware game I've completed, and I wish I could experience it for the first time again. It is a journey through a beautiful, dense, yet hostile world that compels the player to explore the Lands Between and see everything it offers. The first two-thirds of the game is a wonderfully crafted experience and is densely packed with dungeons and caves to explore. Elden Ring is challenging, but the open-world nature of Elden Ring allows the player to fine-tune the difficulty of their playthrough - a player that thoroughly explores the Lands Between will be better equipped, higher level, and generally more comfortable with the game's combat system compared to a player of equivalent skill rushing through the story.

However, the last third is where the magic began wearing off, and as I've engaged with the multiplayer aspect more, Elden Ring's cracks have become more apparent. Below are some of the criticisms I've formed across my two playthroughs of this game:


[h3] Late Game Is Not Perfect [/h3]
Post-Leyndell enemies and bosses do significantly more damage proportionally to your character. Even with 60 Vigor and medium armor, I felt like I was too squishy at some points and relied on boiled seafood and incantations to raise my defenses. However, I could also just be bad at video games.

Actually, I've noticed some similarities between Elden Ring and Monster Hunter Rise Sunbreak. Especially in how their fanbases have responded to some of the changes in the bosses compared to previous titles. In both games, players complained about:
[list]
	[*] Bosses having long combos without many openings for the player
	[*] The amount of tracking some attacks had and how they felt unnatural at times
	[*] Endgame bosses having a lot more AOE attacks to compensate for the player having more movement options
	[*] Endgame boss damage being overtuned, especially with how easily they can roll catch the player due to more attacks having AOEs
	[*] Giant, clunky final boss where it just runs around while you chase it, trying to get hits in
[/list]

While I do have some gripes with the endgame boss design philosophy, the legacy dungeons and bosses really carry the last third of the game even with all their flaws, as the open world is barren by this point, and some of the fights are really fun once they click with you. 

I've gotten better at these fights thanks to playing a bunch of co-op, but I might want to see the damage tweaked a bit to allow for a new player to experiment more with the boss before dying (and so I can help more hosts before they get combo'd to oblivion).


[h3] Great Runes, Rune Arcs, and Invasions [/h3]
Rune Arcs, the item used to activate the effects of the Great Rune you have equipped, are in a weird place. They give you a powerful buff that lasts until death, but Rune Arcs are scarce, 50-60ish in a 100+ hour game where you're expected to die frequently, without farming rats for a 1% drop or engaging in the game's multiplayer. 

You can't even use them unless you are in your own world, so invaders and co-op summons, the players who have the most Rune Arcs and who continue to play the game after completing it, will not get any use out of them, and they can't even drop Rune Arcs for the host to use.

Invasions themselves are in an awkward situation in Elden Ring, as players can only invade worlds that have multiplayer summons or worlds in which the host decided to activate their taunter's tongue. The former situation is much more common and means that invaders will almost always be outnumbered and disadvantaged even if they are higher-skilled players, resulting in frustration, bitterness, and many invaders leaning more towards sweatier setups to secure the win.

Taunter's tongue isn't much better as it removes the timer between invasions, making invasions too frequent instead of just being an occasional, sudden event.

I think Rune Arcs should be more common throughout the Lands Between, and I would like for more multiplayer-centric Great Runes to be added in the DLC. A shop where players can exchange Rune Arcs for rare items would be great, as it would give players more legitimate ways to obtain larval tears (used for re-speccing your character) and other rare crafting materials.

Furthermore, having an active Great Rune should open your world up to invaders, but with a long time between invasions and decreased priority in matchmaking like in previous FromSoftware games (or so I've heard). It would keep the game's multiplayer scene active for longer and would allow for more natural and organic invasions, hopefully reducing toxicity in the community.


[h3] PVP, Netcode, and Suffering [/h3]
I am not going to sugarcoat it: Elden Ring's PVP and multiplayer infrastructure is a hot mess. All connections are P2P, and FromSoftware's netcode was not designed with the international player base in mind. 

One time, I pulled off a combo on my opponent in the Colosseum, but it didn't register until 10 seconds after it happened, and I watched the poor bastard take 1200 damage all at once, get flung into the air, and die. 

The latency isn't always this bad, but it is noticeable enough that combat feels rough and unintuitive for a new player. For example, let's say you hit your opponent on your screen, but due to latency, they saw the attack coming on their screen and dodged. They don't take damage, and you feel robbed. However, status buildup can still be applied in this case even if no damage was exchanged. You can roll through the damaging part of the status proc of bleed and frostbite, albeit you'll still be frostbitten, but madness and sleep procs will stun you out of your I-frames. You can dodge every single attack but then be punished because of how the game applies status buildup.

The same rules apply to you and your opponent, but that doesn't mean it feels great. Especially when PVP balancing is a complete joke and patches only come every few months. There will always be a meta because there will always be a weapon or a build that is stronger and more consistent than the rest, but off-meta options should remain viable, especially if the relative skill between two duelists is roughly equal.

As it stands, certain weapon combinations are oppressively strong, even in the hands of a mediocre player and even worse in the hands of a good player. Additionally, PVP damage is just too high because it uses the same PVE damage formulas, where bosses have HP pools in the thousands and players have 1900 HP at 60 Vigor, and Elden Ring feeds into the player's power fantasy with over-the-top, flashy skills and weapons that are fun to use in PVE but annoying to fight in PVP.

With over 100 weapons to balance and thousands of different build combinations, this game would be a nightmare to balance, and I certainly don't have the solution to perfectly balance this game's PVP.

Regardless, I hope that FromSoftware can alleviate some of these issues in the DLC and future titles. When it's fun, it's addictively fun. When it's not, I regret my life choices. 

[h3] Conclusion [/h3]
Despite my issues with Elden Ring, this is undoubtedly a great game that I do not regret playing through. I am only so critical because I had so much fun with the game and want FromSoftware to make Elden Ring even better (or at least fix their damn netcode for future titles).

Thus, I highly recommend this game if you are at all interested. I thought that I would be done after my first playthrough, but it wasn't long before I made a new character and journeyed through the Lands Between once more.",1708394140,1708394280,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My first review was done at launch and was based on the dominance of item injection exploits and other game destroying hacks carried over from Dark Souls 3. Chiefly among the issues was a remote code execution attack.  

Fromsoftware has fixed the most dangerous exploits, but cheaters are still present. There may also be issues with running the game on Linux and getting falsely banned.

However, Fromsoftware has overwhelmingly corrected issues the community has brought to them. Elden Ring is a fantastic and polished experience. More than a year after release, the combat system has undergone a number of refinements that have made it mostly superior to Dark Souls 3.

I admit that Elden Ring's open world looks appealing, but I would always trade that in for fast-paced gameplay with more combat options. As such, I can't get into this game or any other Souls game.

Dungeons all fall under 4-5 types of cookie cutter environments, rather uninspiring. The final boss fight with Radagon and Elden Beast are incredibly difficult leading up to that point.  Also new game modes NG+ offer nothing new other than increased monster difficulty, very lazy design effort imho. Graphics are excellent, but could be better at times (i.e. water falls look cheap).  Land exploration is excellent, lots of hidden paths/secrets. Torrent should also have multiple skins and possibly powers. You're stuck with the same horse from the very beginning, lame.

Pros:
*Great bosses
*Cool weapons
*Exploring the world is very fun and rewarding
*If you're not using mimic tear or getting overleveled the game will be very exciting and challenging
*You don't actually need shields or different ways of avoiding damage for bosses as some would assume; rolling will always (or at least 99% of the time) work 
*Soundtrack is also great 
*Torrent is best boi

Cons: 
*They added a slighty longer duration to the estus (?) flask and a small delay in the startup of the rolling which will FUCK Bloodborne/DS3 players in the ass until they get used to it (and even after that too sometimes)
*Previous games were super fair since bosses had great animations and with good reflexes you could dodge attacks, so it always depended on your skills and you never had to memorize any attacks, but then Nameless King came and with him Elden Ring later, seriously, these is a huge amount of delayed attacks that will screw will and make it so that you have to memorize some attacks instead of always depending solely on your skills as a player
*Malenia is insanely easy if you're overleveled/use mimic tear (newbie tools btw :v) but hardest boss in the game without a doubt which usually wouldn't be a problem but she's poorly made and has a lot of artificial difficulty which doesn't depend on your actual skills and instead needs pattern memorizing like waterfowl dance and a few others, they should also have removed her lifestill and gave her a third form instead, like Friede in DS3",1708367141,1708367141,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Even at 130 hours in, I'm still stumbling into new places and quests. Everything, from the regions, the NPCs, and especially the bosses, seems to be purposefully crafted.

The game also does not tell me to do this and that. I can do whatever I want, whenever I want, and that's what a real open world game should do.

Can't wait to play the expansion when it comes out. recommend this Elden RIng to anyone who is looking to have fun exploring a world and a challenge this is your game.

It's clear why the Dark Souls franchise still holds up after all this time and Elden Ring seems to follow in the same timeless appeal considering the polish, love, care, and attention to detail in every aspect that it comes shipped with. This, like sleeper hits such as BG3 are the reason I got in to gaming. There's a love here and Elden Ring's love-letter to it's predecessors stands apparent. 

What are you going to love about it? The story, should you chase after it, is as rich, deep, and complex as one may expect from authors Miyazaki and George R. R. Martin. The rich fantasy and imaginative areas make for the Lands Between to be one of the most unique worlds I've come across in any form of media.

Beyond this, the graphics, sure, but mostly, you're going to enjoy the challenge. FromSoft games are challenging. That's their appeal. But it's a fair challenge that urges you to grow and ""git gud"". There's an excitement when you fell that boss for the first time and a fun fraction of a moment where you consider apologising to your controller for ever having considering seeing how many walls it could go through from sheer frustration as you channel your anger and chuck it, That said, take a moment, shift your perspective, and try again. 

Git gud. 

This game is tough but fair. Some moments and attack tracking can feel... odd, but by and large, it's a fair game with famously precise hitboxes making for some of the most cinematic fights one can (accidentally) make. 

Overall, yes, buy this game. Products like this are what keeps creative storytelling and innovative gameplay with an unmatched attention to detail to be the norm moving forward.

I have more hours in DS3 than I'd ever like to admit across Steam and my Xbox, and this game made me hate FromSoft. The bosses all feel cheap. I don't feel like I'm improving, I feel like I'm spending hours learning one boss, then need to forget everything just to spend hours on the next. I'm a series vet and exactly 1 boss in this game has felt any fun. I can't recommend just buying Dark Souls instead enough. This game broke my heart.

Edit: After trying so hard and giving this game too many chances, nothing has changed. I wanted to love it. So many amazing ideas, but this game doesn't bring even the slightest amount of happiness I felt playing Dark Souls. I tried modding it, I tried reading tips and watching people play, I forced myself to play through and beat every single boss to see what I was missing and simply couldn't, before it turned into a buggy mess I physically couldn't even play.

If you don't care about pvp or playing with friends just buy the game, you will love it. However, if you want to know what the online situation is, read below.

 I bought this game on ps5 and PC and they both are great. During my 1300 hours on two different accounts, I can safely tell you that Elden ring PVP is so busted and the lack of balance and poor online item designs are why. And if you don't believe me, go look at the seamless co-op mod. It removes pvp and changes pve with a different version and has over 3 million downloads. I'm obviously not the first to see the problems with vanilla online interactions.

Now back to the in game proof. Take talismans for example. Dragoncrest greatshield increases physical protection by 20 percent but decreases it to 5 in pvp. While I think It shouldn't be decreased that much I see why 20 percent stacked with other buffs may be busted. But now lets look at Shard of Alexander. A powerful talisman which increases the effects of skills by 15 percent (plus a small damage boost that is noticeable in mid to late game on normal attacks), and it has no nerf whatsoever in pvp. How is this good game design? There are almost no attack talismans that have been nerfed, yet all the defense oriented ones get nerfed to unusability. This is why the community hates weapons like rivers, moonveil, and wave of stupidity(waterever that sword is called that you get from beating elden beast). Now I'm not mad about these weapons. I personally have no problem fighting three mages with all moonveils in a gank squad. But if your going to nerf the things I need to protect myself, at least nerf the attack talismans as well. If Shard of Alexander alone is nerfed I feel like a lot of people would stop spamming special attack and actually learn how to play the game. The online items used to access pvp and pve can also be used as a example. I have invaded people on so many different types of levels. I have invaded at level 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 150, 185, 200, 250, 300, and max level commonly. There is common occurrence that happens at all of these levels (except max level, off course). Over leved phantoms. I don't care what you do. If you are fighting a half decent player, there is no way a level 20 can beat a level 20 with two level 200's guarding him. The fact that I see someone using Hand of Melania when I'm invading at level 20 or 40 is complete bull. Granted, I know how to dodge, but it's still bull. When you invade, the game should look at the player with the highest level instead of the host. Then maybe add 1/4 the level of everyone he is playing with. I'm fine with me being level 60 and my friends level 40 and being invaded by a level 50-80. That is a completely fair fight. Another thing is the the design of taunters tongue. The fact that you can even turn it off during a invasion makes me want to break my keyboard. Most of these people will have the blue cipher ring on as well and just keep summoning people to no end. No wonder gank squads are so common, because it's so easy! Another wonderful thing about taunters tongue, the fact that the host gets full heals if they are alone and I only get half is a dumb design choice. At least half their supply if a blue joins, making it fair. I'm not going to fight someone with 14 heals, with aoe spam, with the cipher ring on, while I have 5 heals. Not to mention if they have spells like erdtree heal as well. Good luck trying to do anything then. A lesser problem is true combos. I am all for true combos, they are a really cool, but the ash of wars need to have longer start up times. Spinning slash is one example. Making it a two instead of three combo would make this not overpowered. Don't even get me talking about stormcaller or storm assault either. No wonder people spam special attack everyday. While nerfing true combos will probably be controversial, It will result in a friendlier pvp experience. Another problem is phantom hits. I don't know why I'm dodging but status effects are still effecting me. I posted this response on wiki, but I doubt Fromsoft will see it there, so here is the steam version. I'm open for any counter arguments that may be spoken.",1705209772,1708315890,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

R. Martin. As a seasoned player of FromSoftware titles, I can confidently say that Elden Ring stands as a testament to the studio's dedication to pushing the boundaries of the action RPG genre.

First and foremost, Elden Ring introduces a vast and breathtaking open-world that dwarfs its predecessors. The Lands Between is a sprawling, interconnected realm filled with diverse landscapes, towering castles, and mysterious dungeons. The sheer scale of exploration is awe-inspiring, and every corner of the map beckons with secrets waiting to be unearthed.

The narrative is a captivating tale of cosmic proportions, intricately woven into the fabric of the game's lore. George R. R. Martin's influence is evident in the rich history, complex characters, and the overarching sense of grandiosity. The lore is not just a backdrop but an integral part of the gaming experience, encouraging players to piece together the narrative puzzle as they venture deeper into the world.

True to FromSoftware's signature style, Elden Ring offers a punishing yet deeply satisfying combat system. The weight of each swing, the precision of dodges, and the strategic use of magic contribute to a combat ballet that demands skill, patience, and adaptability. The introduction of mounted combat adds a new layer to the dynamic encounters, as players can engage foes both on foot and astride their trusty steed, Torrent.

The game's character customization and class system allow for a diverse range of playstyles, ensuring that each player's journey through the Lands Between is a unique experience. The extensive skill tree, combined with the flexibility of weapon and magic combinations, grants a sense of agency over character development.

Elden Ring's bosses are a true highlight, offering some of the most challenging and memorable encounters in the genre. Each boss feels like a living, breathing entity with distinct attack patterns and phases. Conquering these formidable foes is not just a test of skill but a triumph of persistence and strategic thinking.

While the game is a testament to excellence, it's not without its minor flaws. The occasional frame rate drops and texture pop-ins, especially in the more expansive areas, slightly mar the otherwise impeccable presentation. However, these issues are forgivable in the grand scope of Elden Ring's achievements.

In conclusion, Elden Ring is a tour de force that exceeds expectations on every front. It pushes the boundaries of what an action RPG can achieve, delivering an unforgettable experience that marries challenging gameplay with a rich, sprawling world. FromSoftware has once again redefined the genre, and Elden Ring stands as a shining beacon in the realm of gaming, inviting players to embark on an epic journey that will resonate long after the credits roll.",1703526894,1708300929,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

    [*]8 GB RAM HyperX Fury;
    [*]Sapphire RX580 Nitro+ 4GB VRAM version.

The game runs between 30 to 60 fps, with an average of 45-50 fps on HIGH settings depending of the region and will drop to 20-25 fps when is loading for some seconds a new area. The game will run smooth in close quarter building with the max 60 fps. 
With my current spec I've met some stutters, but they were minor and it didn't affect my fights or exploration.

When it comes to controls they are very clunky at least at the start of the game, but you will get used to them. I know their games are meant to be played with a controller, but I don't like it very much as ""I can't feel the control over my character"". You will get the classic experience with the KMB: Q being back for menu and lock-target while playing, R using consumables, E picking up items and the arrows being the switch for weapons, spells and consumables. What is new in this game and what I changed is the SPRINT being put on SPACE, by holding it. I've moved it to SHIFT where I moved also BACKSTEP, DODGE ROLL and DASH that were also put on SPACE. I left the CROUCH on X, and moved the JUMP from F to SPACE. Also be aware that the map is not on M is actually on G, which sadly you can't change it.
Also some tips & tricks:
[list]
    [*]You can change the prompt of controls from Setting > Sound and Display > Device for On-Screen Prompts > Keyboard and Mouse;
    [*]To change from one handed to two-handed and vice versa hold E + LEFT MOUSE BUTTON;
    [*]It's good to put your trusty steed Torrent in your pouch so you can access it by holding E + LEFT, UP, RIGHT, DOWN ARROW (choose your preference).
[/list]
Hope this helps!
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now I'm gonna talk about the worldbuilding, mechanics and quests. The world of Elden Ring it's very mesmerizing, very mysterious, but also dangerous. When I played, I finally had the feeling of ""I'm going to an adventure"", and the last time I felt that way was back in Dark Souls 3. The open world it's fantastic and everything it's build with care and attention with tons of different things to either discover or fight. At this moment I have 853 photos that I took through my gameplay and I usually either forget to take photos in game, or take them to a minimum level. I'm amazed about what they built with the same ENGINE and how much depth and details they put into their work, some photos that I took I can even put them as background for my PC, because they look so good and clean. Every single zone from Limgrave to the final zone [spoiler]Farum[/spoiler] it's incredible, filled with so much details, everything has it's own identity, which I personally like it to the very end.
---
The story of the game is ""simple"", yet complex when you put every single piece of information gathered either through dialogue with NPCs, quests or by exploring. In this game, YOU are a Tarnished, once banished for losing the blessing of the Grace and now recalled back with other Tarnished after the Shattering, in The Lands Between to recover the Great Runes, restore the Elden Ring and become the next Elden Lord.
What I like about the games made by FromSoftware? They never handhold you, or at least they are doing that to a minimum level. It's an open world, you're free to explore, to do whatever you want. But because it's an open world don't expect to fight the end game enemies fast. What you should take in consideration when you play Elden Ring:
[list]
    [*]Sites of grace are your compass, they tell you where the Shard bearers are and where to go next. If you follow them, be assured that you will not get lost, but at the same time don't forget to explore the vast world and meet the other Tarnished (NPCs)
    [*]Elden Ring is not linear as the other past games made by FromSoftware. New players or even veterans, that got used to the old mechanics, don't understand that freedom might be also your biggest enemy. If you explore and reach a zone where you get overwhelmed and destroyed by monster, don't get upsate that it's unfair, just keep in mind you come back later after you got strong and far into the story. [spoiler]I got teleported to Caelid because of a trap chest and I wondered why I wasn't doing that much damage, but I knew that later on I will be fine.[/spoiler]
    [*]As I said previously you have freedom which is your friend and at the same time your enemy. The world is vast and filled with secrets, dungeons, mini-bosses and items. Don't be afraid to discover them, you might discover a spell or weapon that you will like it and presumably will make you stronger.
    [*]Listen to what NPCs have to say. They will tell you where you will meet them in the future, EXPECT that you will meet them. Don't get mad that you lost a quest, or did something bad, learn what you did wrong, plan what to do in your next journey when you finish the game.
    [*]Use every resource you have to your own advantage. Read the messages that other players left behind, some might help you, some might not, and some are wrote just for fun, but they are there. Miyazaki wants the community to help each others, that's why there are messages. Use steam forums, ask for help, ASK YOUR FRIENDS, if you want you can take a glimpse at a guide on the internet on what to do with a specific NPC, quest, as it's not something to be ashamed about, everyone is doing mistakes, and everyone is hitting a wall sometimes. You did a mistake with an NPC in your run, but I will do better in my next one. JUST DO IT!
    [*]Use the map! Pin your NPC, resources, ANYTHING!
    [*]A boss is hard? You spent 1,5 hours trying to beat it? (Looking at you Valiant Gargoyles) You have many options: request help, play with friends, use summon ashes, find a suitable Ash of War for that fight.
    [*]The AI of monsters, mini-bosses, bosses is learning from your moves and mistakes. Unlike the past souls games, in Elden Ring you might get overwhelmed by a long series of fast attacks or even insta kills. Learn from your mistakes, hone your skills, it's possible to beat it!

RL sux!
ER is the way to go! :D

That is until you reach the lategame.

My advice: Play the game until you defeat M the O King. Well could push it alittle further until you B the ET. Pretend that is the final boss. respec, or just uninstall and go on with shitty RL ;).

Because the last few bosses in this game are the worst insane f**** RNG fests you have ever seen in a From Soft game. It is certainly not ""Hard but fair"" anymore. This Credo died at the altar of ""possibility"" and ""open world"". 

Do you get your moneys worth if you quit before the BS starts? Sure. 
But i expectded better things from this developer.

Had to revisit this.

TLDR: I played it again from the start with a meta build. Makes the whole game much smoother. like 6 tries was the maximum per boss. I still think endgame is kinda bad. And i would have prefered the game being friendlier towards blind playthroughs. But can't leave this on negative.

The stuttering can be quite bad on PC.
Craftable items are a issue as there is a limited amount of stuff you can craft or have and farming for what you can farm for can be a nightmare.
As for PvP...
..the new backstab is great, there has been some decent changes and balances recently but the game still needs a few tweaks PvP wise.
Double lance/heavy thrusting weapons are far too strong.
Poise and hyper armor are too strong. Arena sizes for duels are too large. 
Some spells are borderline useless and some can be dodge by just moving left to right.
Same go for ashes of war, a lot are useless. Flame strike, golden parry, storm caller are still broken.
The free aim on spells are also terrible and have very limited aiming angles.
Still no rewards or rankings for PvP/Arena or covenants, making PvP a bit dry. 
Phantom hits are still a issue but mostly just when you hit/bomb and get procced with madness/frost or when you have a proc of bleed/frost nearly full then someone rolls and it resets the status bar.",1649534941,1708275273,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It transports me back to the first time I played Dark Souls, as I eagerly anticipate returning to the Lands Between every morning upon waking up. It's incredibly immersive, and the world is absolutely stunning. The lore is exceptional, as expected, and it's evident that From Software has incorporated elements from every Souls game (including Bloodborne/Sekiro) in the development of Elden Ring. It's definitely worth purchasing, but keep in mind that it may be very challenging for some players at the beginning (especially if you're new to the franchise).

I appreciate the variety of weaponry available, which allows for a multitude of different builds and playthroughs. I admire the effort that From Software put into encouraging players to utilise the FP mechanic by introducing Ashes of War skills. This ultimately enables players to approach the game in numerous ways while experimenting with different builds.

Is the game flawless? Not entirely... there are two aspects of the game that I find worth criticising. Firstly, the repetition of bosses becomes monotonous after a while. I understand, to some extent, why this occurs in an open-world game. Secondly, the hit-boxes of some bosses are quite problematic... the dragons in Azula, for instance, and that Death Bird's Abomination, too. They were defeated... but my greatsword couldn't reach their heads... though I suppose this might not be an issue for certain builds. There are bugs, but they aren't significant enough to dissuade me from enjoying the game.

Regardless, it's a fantastic experience, so give it a try. You won't regret it. :)",1649543171,1708262414,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

+ Incredibly vast and beautiful open world filled to the brim with content,spectacular vistas and unending dangers, basically the anti-Ubisoft open world

+ Trademark pitch perfect souls combat from the creators of the genre, build variety is top among all the souls series

+ Incredibly good lore with magnificent characters ( Ranni the Witch a personal favorite) with a great story that in pure From Software style needs to be discovered all around you

+ Some of the best bosses fight in the genre, only reached by Lies of P recently

+ Top of the class music and voicework for the entire cast of characters

Con:

- Reuse of minibosses and minor dungeons, catacombs, caverns and their respective minibosses are reused with slight variations quite often, same for some of the open world encounters

- Incredibly weird difficulty spike in the last third of the game that can take even experienced souls player by surprise, also the enemies in the third part are mostly enemies from the rest of the world but with hp doubled and damage tripled, can feel slightly lazy or rushed

- A polarizing last boss where you have a magnificent phase 1 and probably the worst souls boss ever made by From Software for phase 2, its quite jarring

To say that Elden Ring is one of the best games ever made is useless, everyone of the planet knows that already, it battles with Bloodborne and Dark Souls 3 for the throne of best From Software game ever made and in some spots it wins for sure, the Land Between are a pleasure to explore, conquer and die into and basically every player that is not immediately against hard games should buy and play Elden Ring.

The quality is really bad compared to Dark Souls series or Sekiro or Bloodborne.

The game is nice to play only for 1 play through

This is undoubtedly the most boring repeat same bosses with higher stats in the series, everything is copy pasted

The save system does not work properly, at any point in time your save can get corrupted with no point of return. (Requires you to manually backup multiple versions of your save files....yes in 2024!)

No ultra wide screen support, yes in 2024!

Honestly this is like a 7/10 game and when compared to Dark Souls 3 a 4/10

However, I can offer a speculative review based on the information available prior to its release. ""Elden Ring"" is an upcoming action role-playing game developed by FromSoftware and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment, known for their work on the ""Dark Souls"" series. Here's a speculative review listing potential positives and negatives:

Positives:

FromSoftware's Legacy: ""Elden Ring"" is developed by FromSoftware, a studio renowned for its challenging and atmospheric games. With a track record that includes critically acclaimed titles like ""Dark Souls,"" ""Bloodborne,"" and ""Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,"" expectations are high for ""Elden Ring"" to deliver an immersive and compelling experience.

Open-World Exploration: ""Elden Ring"" promises to feature an expansive open world for players to explore. FromSoftware's previous games have excelled in creating intricate and atmospheric environments, filled with hidden secrets, challenging enemies, and lore-rich storytelling. The open-world format could allow for even greater freedom and discovery.

Collaboration with George R.R. Martin: ""Elden Ring"" features collaboration with acclaimed fantasy author George R.R. Martin, known for his work on the ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" series, which inspired the ""Game of Thrones"" television show. Martin's involvement suggests a rich and detailed narrative that could elevate the game's storytelling to new heights.

Combat and Gameplay Depth: FromSoftware games are known for their deep and strategic combat systems, which require careful timing, positioning, and mastery of various weapons and abilities. ""Elden Ring"" is expected to build upon this foundation, offering challenging encounters and rewarding gameplay for players who enjoy a high level of difficulty.

Negatives:

High Difficulty: While the challenging gameplay is a hallmark of FromSoftware titles, it can also be a barrier for some players. The difficulty level of ""Elden Ring"" may deter those who prefer more casual or accessible gaming experiences, potentially limiting its appeal to a niche audience.

Performance Issues: Open-world games often face technical challenges related to performance, optimization, and bugs. Given the ambitious scope of ""Elden Ring"" and FromSoftware's track record with technical issues in past titles, there is a possibility that the game could encounter performance issues at launch or require post-launch patches to address.

Steep Learning Curve: FromSoftware games are known for their steep learning curves, requiring players to adapt to complex mechanics and unforgiving combat encounters. While rewarding for those who enjoy a challenge, ""Elden Ring"" may prove frustrating for players who struggle to overcome its initial difficulty spike.

Sparse Information Pre-Release: As of now, details about ""Elden Ring"" are limited, and much of the game's content and features remain shrouded in mystery. While this aura of anticipation can be exciting for fans, it also leaves room for disappointment if the final product fails to meet heightened expectations.

In conclusion, ""Elden Ring"" has the potential to be a groundbreaking addition to FromSoftware's catalog, offering an expansive open world, rich storytelling, and challenging gameplay. However, it also carries the risk of technical issues, accessibility barriers, and unmet expectations. Fans of FromSoftware's previous titles and lovers of challenging action RPGs will likely find much to enjoy in ""Elden Ring,"" but newcomers should approach with caution and be prepared for a demanding and immersive experience.

Off topic: Builds loose any sense after you reach level 200 and you can use mage power on a samurai or bandit build, to be honest i dont know what they could do to differentiate more the builds !!!

I can say that i was in doubt between this and RED2 as my favorite games, but finally i choose the one that improved over the other in many aspects : replay-ability and open world !

The only weakness of Elden Ring i say is the story , which i had to ""google it"" to fully understand that things that happened before ( Fromsoftware if you want to do a prequel about The Shattering , please do it well or better dont do it all )

It has difficulty that is right .... Melania for example ..... but i think the aspect of Graces saves the player and helps on rune farming ... to be honest no matter how bump up your stats are, Melania can slash u in 2 moves , so skill and learning the move set even if it takes over 5h to beat the Melania , is worth :))) 

This game is worth the money even at full price. If anytime lowers the price just grab it and you will have a great time !

Elden Ring so far outclasses the older games in so many ways, that i find it very hard to return to any of them. In many ways its the hardest of them all but at the same time more forgiving than its predecessors. this is owed to the worlds' open exploration mindedness. banging your head against a boss fight? go somewhere else in the region, or better yet, explore an earlier section more deeply. it was during these moments that i found some of the more engaging aspects of the game, like a slowly expanding crafting system, various fights you never have to do that net you awesome items, chests that teleport you across the map, and interesting areas to farm in. Not to mention the talismans which can alter your playstyle to be more in line with Bloodborne. Magic feels like something that is useful to everyone, even non-magic builds.

the world and story are uh fine. its amazing and beautiful to look at, but you'll always be kept at arms length from its lore and history, thanks to FROMs usual brand of item-description based storytelling and comically cryptic NPCs. Whats there is also simply not as interesting to delve into as DS or Bloodborne. the lack of a journal system makes this game's vast world and numerous quests irritating to keep track of. if its been a while since you last played, you may find it easier to just start over.

Bring Bloodborne to PC.

The amount of weapons or spells with unique and eye pleasing effects is hugee, everyone will find atleast one weapon which makes you fall in love with it. Lore isnt directly told to the player for the most time, you have to dicover it by yourself (AND ITS AMAZING). Designs of enemies, bosses, npcs, areas and wearable armor - almost all of them are BEAUTIFUL. Every aspect of this game is almost perfect, its hard to find other games that good but despite that i found 2 things that takes away few points for me:

- replay ability - i found it hard to go through this whole game over and over again. I though about it for a while and came to conslusion that the distances between everything are HUGEE and when you completed your firsth playthrough exploring literally every little corner of this game youll lose almost all of your motivation to play it again. This might be only my problem because Ive heard from many people that its way more replayable than other dark souls games because of this huge world but idk. Mabye someone will find it relatable. 

- The amount of closed areas - Like the classic dark souls ones, they could easly squize two or three more. Theyre iterally the best moments of this game. Despite being the best moments i found them empty and neglected in some small parts. (This thinking may be caused by the love i share to all dark souls games)

I THINK THAT MANY PEOPLE WILL NOT FIND ANY PROBLEMS OR WONT RELATE TO MY DOWNSIDES SO YOUR GOOD TO GO!!

TO SUM IT UP - you MUST play this game, its amazing in almost every aspect ;3

The exploration in this game is phenomenal. There is always something to be doing wherever you are, always a cave, always some ruins, always an evergaol or a puzzle or something. There are no vast, empty stretches of nothing in this game like there are in so many other open world games. However, this does lead to the issue of encounter reuse. A lot of those caves are filled with the same enemies, evergaols are mostly just reused bosses, once you do one puzzle tower you sort of get how to do all of them. By the time you finish the game, you'll realize that there are really only a handful of unique encounters, and I think that's a bit of a shame. I wish some of the bigger fights were truly unique so they felt more special. But instead you can find a copy of a big quest-ending boss in a cave somewhere.

The main issue I have with this game comes down to balance. They player is given a lot of tools and a lot of talismans and equipment that seems to imply that those tools would be useful, but the vast majority of them are just trash. Poison status damage is just worse Scarlet Rot. Holy damage is basically unusable at the end of the game. Smaller weapons like claws and daggers and fists stand no chance against larger enemies when you can't even reach their bodies. Death blight is completely useless in PvE, but a lot of spells/gear inflict it.

On the flip side, some stuff just feels way too over-tuned. Jump attacks are almost always the best thing you can be doing as a melee player. Some sorceries scale so hard you might as well just have a gun to shoot enemies with. Dragon cult incantations are way more powerful than most other incantations. It feels like the game has a handful of ""correct"" builds, and a lot of distractions to throw you off of those builds, and it hopes you figure out which is which by the end game.

All of that being said, this game is still a lot of fun. It feels great when you make a build that works well, and it has so many options that you'll be thinking of alternative builds for future characters the whole time you play.",1708208268,1708208268,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

And I'm talking about ""Bethesda"" levels of jank at times, and most of it comes from the same reason: a ""Bigger is Better"" mentality that permeates the entire design phylosophy of the game, and after the initial shock is starts losing it's luster the more the game drags on. 

The world is vast, with great environments to explore and some clever tricks awaiting the player exploring the catacombs, some of which trully spectacular and some of which literally a white curtain of nothing to see; but at the same time this became an excess, with a map far larger than the enemy variety they were willing to make, including a constant repetition of minibosses (specially the Godskin ones and the lava dragon),and making NPCs almost impossible to find without the external help of a guide or a lot of sheer luck, kind of defeating the purpose of the ""no handholding"" philosophy people like to highlight.

Bosses are massive, with a lot of well animated attacks and patterns that can change based on players actions or positions (except for like 3, and are truly the highlight of the game; but this also becomes an excess. In a rather ironic twist, the bigger the moster is, the less you actually see of it due to camera limitations (a camera that I already called a possible dealbreaker in Sekiro, a game with mostly human sized enemies, and is left almost intact to try combat things 10 times the size) so most fights against giant enemies, at least if fighting melee, consisted of having the entire screen occupied by the enemy crotch or rear area it couldn't reach with most of their normal attacks while trying to dodge their AoE through sheer instinct. Several field monsters are also too big for the scenario where the fight takes place, ending in situations like having a dragon climb up a hill outside of reach and having to wait for it to respawn to resume combat, having it land on a wall and stand on it vertical, or the rather infamous Night Cavalry who have all their attacks reset by the walls of the very bridges they lurk. All of this made me appreciate a lot more the ""smaller"", more human like bosses which you could properly see, though they too posed a problem to the camera when they could fly or jump high, as the lock-on's way to keep track of them when they did that in front of you was to rapidly flip up and down while remaining attach to the player's back (second phase Malenia, in particular, caused me nausea due to this constant sudden movements).

Another excess can be found in the variety and options for combat: multiple kinds of weapons are available for you to fit your playstile in any way you want, but at the same time most of the gear feels poorly balanced, with some things that are early jewels that eclipse late game prizes or rare drops. The spells in particular, at least in the incantation section in which I delved, suffered a lot in this regard, as a lot of the stuff I kept finding were basically trash, to slow or weak to replace a simple lightning javelin I got like 20 hours in. The weapons had a similar case: a lot of bloat, with mechanics that are similar in weapons of the same class except for some outliers, but ultimately living or dying due to their scaling or skill. There's a considerable amount of cool or niche stuff to find, but the size of the game calls for them to be rare gems in a sea of mediocre gear you can't even test out for fun due to limitations of stat builds and smiting material.

Ultimately, that's where the game experience eventually leads. The thrill of exploration and fighting really good bosses is certainly there, I had a lot of fun in the game to not recommend it; but at the same time it has it's fair share of frustrations, the game prisoner of it's own bloat, it's own hype, and a camera system that didn't evolve since their last game at all and fails to properly highlight what From Software seems to think is their biggest strenght: fighting huge stuff. I will play some more in NG+ and I'm looking forward to see how the DLC turns out, but also I can't deny my plans to check the Dark Souls trilogy were put on ice after experiencing this, which makes me wonder if my view of Elden Ring would have been more negative had I played the others first.",1708199468,1708199956,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A Fromsoftware game with an open world and worldbuilding by George R.R Martin (Game of Thrones author). Almost a masterpiece.

Complaints are:

Replays arent too fun.

Feeling of exhaustion when wandering the open world and fighting some enemies.

Reuse of some bosses that make the main story boss encounters less special.

One shots that sometimes feel unfair.

Useless rewards for exploring ""mini"" areas in the world, rewards that only work for specific builds.

Repeated use of bosses and enemies to fill dungeons and such, but is kind of to be expected for how big of an openworld it is.

Pvp could also get better but will probably be expanded on upon release of dlc and other patches.

Initially daunted by their reputation for unyielding difficulty, I found myself repeatedly humbled by the game's unforgiving nature. However, with each defeat came a deeper understanding of its intricate combat system, culminating in moments of triumph that are unparalleled in gaming. Overcoming adversaries like Maliketh, Malenia, and the Fire Giant left me breathless and exhilarated, echoing Miyazaki's desire for players to experience the joy of conquering adversity.

Elden Ring is not just a game; it's a testament to the power of perseverance and dedication, and achieving 100% completion on Steam feels like a monumental achievement, a testament to the countless hours spent overcoming its challenges. In the end, Elden Ring stands as a modern masterpiece and a work of digital art, beckoning all who dare to heed its call.

         弱引导   游戏既然做了开放世界，肯定内容和体量比前几作体量更多，但是有一个问题就是，没有任何引导，导致玩家必须要根据攻略才能正常进行游戏，如果在进行一些支线的时候，不看攻略进行游玩的话，就会很容易断掉支线，比如白金之子支线我已经在摩尔城探索完再去进行白金之子支线，结果失色古龙岩没了😥，以及蛇女拉雅的支线，还有涅斐丽支线涉及6个npc，不看攻略根本玩不了。我认为这个弱引导又跟老贼的强调把自由探索权利交给玩家的理念有所冲突，既然自由探索，但是又要非得按照游戏固定的剧情推进支线，没有一点引导确实开荒有点困难😫。
         职业平衡性    艾尔登法环有个“字”，所以在该作法师就是爸爸。应该是吸取了只狼门槛太高太难导致销量没达到粉丝社预期的教训，老头环为了让受众群体更多，法师的强大正好又减弱了魂类游戏的困难，轮椅角色正好可以降低游戏难度的同时给予普通玩家游戏体验，所以艾尔登法环还是有很多小姐姐玩法师的😋，不过对于原本的魂类玩家，老贼也没有让我们委屈，选择近战还是能体会到历代最强的boss战（女武神来陪你跳支舞吧），仍然魂味十足，把困难和简单的选择权直接交给玩家，而不是以往其他游戏传统的困难简单的游戏难度选择，这就是宫崎老贼的明智之处。
         后期体验较差    我认为老头环的设计巅峰是史东威尔城，正门后门的选择，以及隐藏boss，重重叠叠的地图设计等等，应该算是体量最大（王城加下水道的话就没得说）而且整个游戏中独一无二的城堡。不过中后期的游戏体验倒不如前期那么惊艳，制作组偷懒，素材重复使用，打来打去也是那些boss，摩尔城更是把史东威尔城的小怪搬过来，后期就有点类似刷刷刷的感觉了。
          容易摔死    我感觉这是我最破防的一方面了，要不就是跟boss打着打着突然翻滚摔下去了，要不就是因为老贼的变态设计，找路和走迷宫摔下去，有时候你觉得不是很高，跳下去也是摔死😭，而且人物有时候还会脚滑，踩到边缘又是摔下去，骑着灵马想要从一个狭窄的地方跳到更高的地方，灵马调一个头他就会自己往前走一步，然后又摔下去，然后就是看进度条，再复活，再跑路，老实说打boss我都没那么破防过🥺
           容易卡视角   打老头环的时候我非常讨厌打大型怪，大型怪放技能的时候，根本很难看到他的前摇动作，一开始打皮蛋的时候，释放艾尔登流星我疯狂拉视角想看流星然后翻滚，结果视角一直拉不到。
          战斗锁定      我也不知道这锁定是什么抽风，有时候准备打怪，他不给我锁定面前的怪突然锁定到后面的羊，我直接心态爆炸
         后期圣树村小怪数值太强     没什么好说的，反正体验不咋地就对了，圣树村的小怪太强了，而且圣树村城堡底下好几只皇室幽魂，真的司马玩意。
          游戏优化差    如果你能接受60帧的话，那你也要尝试接受一下掉帧，当你一开局遇到帧率守卫的话，那你就有的难受了。
         好了，以上是我接近200小时的二周目体验加盗版100小时到王城的个人主观游戏体验，希望对要入坑魂类游戏的小伙伴有所帮助。虽然大毛病没有，小毛病不断，但是作为全新新颖的游戏尝试，老贼的超前思想，过硬的游戏质量，还是值得尝试的。",1708172867,1708172867,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,2,True,False,False

the open world causes a lot of things to begin to feel very copy paste. when your not in a legacy dungeon the game becomes ""run around and fill out little map points of interest"" this is fun the first time around but on a second or third playthrough itll become rather tired out quickly. the combat feels very similar to dark souls 3 but a lot more forgiving. posture is now a thing so frontal ripostes become much more common place without needing to parry. this game truly excels in build variety. there are so many spells, weapons, ashes of war, spitirt ashes, to mess around. respeccing stats is unlocked earlier and is cheap so you can mess around with builds. the only limiting factor is how many final upgrade items you get per playthrough.

the bigger problems i have with this game are the soundtrack, the story, and the inevitable downsides that come from an open world. the soundtrack is fine. a lot of boss themes are very good. the problem is the fact that it feels like they only put effort into the boss music. there are no melancholy tunes in the whole game. Demons souls, dark souls, and dark souls 2, all had amazing title and hub music. its a shame that the only somewhat quiet song that plays in elden ring is the open world ambient music. its mediocre at best and becomes very tired out.

for story bringing on George R.R. Martin feels like one of the worst mistakes they could have done. learning about relationship drama between the main bosses of the game is the main thing that drags the story down in my opinion. i much prefer the stories of dark souls 1, demon's souls, and bloodborne. Im not a fan of game of thrones and would have liked if his style of writing stayed out of the successor to dark souls.

despite all that this game is still amazing and sure to give you many many hours of fun. :)",1708098164,1708138523,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Zelda? Yes.
Super Mario players? Surprisingly, yes. 
Dark Souls players? Yes.
Visual Novel players? No.
Godeater players? Yes.
Star Craft? No.
Diablo players? Maybe Diablo 1+2 players.
MMO players? Not unless they were stressed out raid leaders.
By players of those games, I mean if that's ALL they like to play and don't want to traverse too deep into another genre... I found the original Demon's Souls straight out of Tales of Symphonia and loved it. So I can't judge what you might be into unless you try it!

Elden Ring does a lot right in the genre. It's the perfect blend of world exploration and anoul grape... When you fight a lot of things you're over levelled for, you won't know... you'll just think you're the bees knees, so you enter a new area and think ""hah! What are you? Bird bird!? Come here and I'll teach you the meaning of pain!"" only to get mushed into pulp by its ginormous beak. Then you'll get wiser, and come at it from a different approach. More careful. More dodgy, more gud... and win! Maybe. Or you get pummeled again and then realize... maybe you aren't supposed to be here yet? You'll never know. The game gives you a lot of freedom right out the gates, especially with mods like Convergence. 
Apart from the open world that keeps you guessing on what progression path you were supposed to take it has the classic Dark Souls feel.
By that I mean NPC quests that are anything but linear, to the point of being ridiculous(seriously, just follow a guide, there's no shame in it), bosses that you need to rethink over and over again before you can get the hang of them, and zones with dangers that have you looking over your inventory desperately trying to find what resists scarlet rot or fire.
At the end of the day, I find myself coming back for more. Am I a masochist? No, I've modded the game before to be easy for me and just enjoyed it as an easy RPG. On the other hand, I am a masochist to the point that I also like playing the original experience or even a tougher one. I've also modded the game before to be one shots. Players and NPCs all one shot... So I dunno. It's definitely an experience worth having if you're a fan of action RPGs, calculating boss moves and creating builds that will overcome certain challenges and adapting builds for different situations, then yes, you'll probably love Elden Ring, and I can recommend it. If you want a story, and are a fan of having the plot told to you carefully through character archs and story chapters that are linear and make sense... then no. You won't find a lot to keep you invested here.
Thank you for reading and I hope you found this review helpful.

Elden Ring is a beautiful game and propably one of the bests ever made.
It is a classic soulslike experience and has incredible detail and much to explore and many things to try.
But that is sadly the thing I am tired of.
It is not Elden Ring in particular, but more the point I realise I am tired of its key features. Mainly the combat.
This started propably with dark souls 2, continued in 3 and Elden Ring is the line where I realize my hatred of said tiredness, that is ruining my experience.
After many raging fits, broken controllers and deleting the games and coming back to it over and over and over again it feels just unhealthy to keep playing. And why should I, if it feels like a waste of time to me? I rather keep the fond memories of the fresh experience of the first game then replacing it with new stressed out ones.

First of all, I would like to mention the music on the start screen: Before starting the game, I had to enjoy this masterpiece first. Every time I started the game, I loved listening to it. It is so beautiful. And best of all, the entire soundtrack is a masterpiece. A few pieces of music simply won me over so much, they are very catchy tunes.  

I also really liked the character creation. My character is smiling :)

When I saw Limgrave for the very first time, I was immediately captivated. The entire game world is simply beautiful and I sometimes just stopped to look at the graphic details. The effects and the lights, the sky, everything is a work of art.
This game world is so huge, you discover something new every time and I was always pleasantly surprised.

The gameplay and the role-playing aspects are stunning. It's just incredible fun, you definitely need a lot of patience and you shouldn't get frustrated too quickly. Just enjoy the game and see how you get better and better. Here you definitely need to find out how you survive first (in terms of stat distribution), then you'll enjoy the rest of the game as much as I did.

In this game you have to find out a lot for yourself. Also when it comes to the story elements.
That makes exploring twice as exciting.

I played through the game solo and only found out later on how to help others in co-op, which is incredibly fun. You meet all sorts of different people and everyone is generally very nice. The emote function is also very cool.
I personally haven't experienced much PvP yet, but I'm going to get into that too. 

All in all, I recommend this work of art. Get into it and you will enjoy many, many great hours of play.
Thanks to my friend for believing in me; that I could do it while others said: ""You can't do it anyway.""
Now I've finished it before them.
This game has a very high emotional value. I'm looking forward to the DLC.

It is worth noting that Elden Ring is probably Hidetaka Miyazaki's most accessible and friendly game to newcomers in his series of ""Souls Games"". Where as others in the series put you up against bosses in a more linear fashion, Elden Ring allows you to explore freely and go level up somewhere else to eventually come back and progress past the boss that kicked your ass before.

The quality and care that went into the level design, art style and animations is so good that it puts other games to shame. If Call of Duty is the McDonald's of gaming, then Elden Ring is a 5 star Michelin restaurant where you want to savor every bite.

It's a game that solidifies that videogames are indeed art.

The best part of the game is it's unforgiving at every moment but you're given the opportunity to read all the movesets and try to defeat the bosses. So everytime you die you not only die with frustration but also die knowing something new to deal with the boss and you really get the best kind of dopamine each time you defeat these bosses. You're also given the freedom to fight however the hell you want. Every main boss is uniquely designed with their own set of brutal but awesome move sets. The larger enemies are kind of tedious to fight, they look awesome, the setpieces are visually gorgeous but most of the time they're not as fun as the other enemies who are more challenging and at the same time more fun. Also I really wish the game had a feature where you could replay all these bosses without entering someone else's world. Story wise, I did feel disconnected throughout but I don't think it even matters all that much since it more than makes up for it with the gameplay. Another problem I had with the game is how locked away most of the main bosses are, the game really wants to explore every nook and cranny of its extremely vast open world but it's really hard to look for most of the bosses without an YouTube video guiding you. The exploration aspect is definitely cool but I find myself craving more to fight the bosses the game has to offer. Getting to Malenia was more frustrating than the boss fight itself. It's kinda understandable the developers design the game in a way to get the online community to interact and come up with all the solution to the most bizzare puzzles they've set, but personally I would have preferred it to be easily accessible. If this is the best game of FromSoftware when it comes to accessibility then I really don't know how I'd fair out in their other games. The game doesn't look next gen or anything but it's got one of the best art style you can ever find in a game. The performance was stuttery and it would actually get worse if I lower the settings, the only work around with the performance is playing the game offline. Playing it offline kinda stabilised the performance. Also the final fight had one of the best bosses and at the same time one of the game's worst. I would have really enjoyed the final fight if Radagon had a second phase or something, elden beast was absolutely abhorrent of a boss, the most annoying part of the game for me.

This game really is an open world Dark Souls 2 and it shows. DS3 is a more polished experience, DS2 has a lot more meme potential and soul, BB has better art direction, and it will never be as nostalgic in 12 years as Dark Souls is now.

That being said, it is not a bad game. It's a lot of fun until you beat [spoiler]Morgott for the final time.[/spoiler]. Everything after that point feels like a bloody chore. And it sucks, because the last few bosses are a lot of fun, but by the time you get to them, you're so tired of the game that they aren't enjoyable. 

The bosses in this game are also not *nearly* as hard as the community would make you believe. I beat  [spoiler]Malenia[/spoiler] on the third try, and [spoiler]Godfrey, Radagon and Elden Beast[/spoiler] on the first try. *Orphan of Kos* and *Isshin, The Sword Saint* these are not. 

This lack of difficulty comes down to simply being able to roll through things you really shouldn't be able to. You can simply roll through a lot of AOEs that look like you need to jump over or run away from. Sadly there isn't much of an indication as to whether you need to roll through them or around them, you just have to feel it out and get your timing down right. Once you have it, they really aren't that bad. The downside is, all bosses do a lot of damage that will result in you getting killed very quickly unless you level Vigor all the way to 60 or higher, and even then you're still taking a lot of damage. 

I would change a lot about this game if I could, but thankfully that's where mods come in. Seamless Coop makes playing with your friends much more enjoyable and easy, and you won't have to deal with invaders or hackers. If you like invading... I would stick to Dark Souls 3, as sad as that sounds. Even with all the BS in Dark Souls 3, it's much better optimized for PVP than this game is. 

TLDR: It's worth a buy, but I'd wait for a sale unless you really want it. The game is too long but if you don't mind 50-100 hours per character to get to the end, go for it. May Chaos Take The World.",1674009212,1708056090,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Only because now that I've finally completed the game and lived in this world for so many hundreds of hours. I know I will never have those initial awe inspiring first impressions of discovering a new location, fighting a creature the size of house, dealing with the odd death streaks here and there only to come back stronger ready for the next death streak and so on.
Oh... and all while jaw dropped most of the time because of how amazing this experience is.

This game is special. Okay sure, you can say that about many other iconic games. Subnautica for instance, and I bring that game up in particular because I went into it in the same way I did with Elden Ring... Not knowing anything about it.
I'm so glad I didn't because the vistas, characters, challenges, discovery, soundtrack, intrigue all latched itself onto me like scarlet rot and I can't get it off!!!
What do you mean don't roll in poison and rot???
IT SOAKS INTO YOUR CLOTHES... WHAT???????

Rendering in this game, things and creatures in distance, are actually there, moving, living. Why should we even mention graphics in this game, simple 10/10. FromSoftware, after this game, became my 2nd favorite developer. They are doing dream coming true. This game is for every lover of soul, hard, perfection game, with Dragons (Thank you George R.R. Martin for GOT and this!), multiple bosses which each is pure ART of creation, of big brain developer somewhere in Japan... 

Music is also something unique. All DS have great music, but this one... Overpass them all!

Truly, I dont know how to describe this game, I cannot explain my emotion. I skipped a lot of parts in 1st gameplay, but things I've seen in 1st go, cannot wait to see details I am gonna see in next hours of playing. 

All in all, ELDEN RING is probably best game even now in 2024. I bought it in 2022 when it came out, but never had time to finish all DS and ELDEN RINGS in order, so I did it finally!

Total recommendation, buy it, try it, enjoy it, play it. Game offers you different types of character build, which is even amazing. You can make it easy for you, or hard for you. Lots of options, GREAT!

I hope I will soon see more games from FromSoftware such is this masterpiece, and soon!

P.S. game has some FPS drops in certain places, but since its masterpiece, you can easily forgive and forget it!

First of all, let's just get over the first thing you going to see, the graphics/performance: Overall, the graphics are decent, nothing to brag about, however the performance is a little bit questionable, sometimes the game freezes, other times it just stutters for no reason, it is undeniable that this game struggles with fps for a not so amazing graphics. This game crashes more than it should, for example, in my entire experience playing souls like, none of them crashed on me but ER.
Second,gameplay. The level design,well, it's hard to judge,most of the time the levels are good-ish, but sometimes I can read the developer mind: "" how can I make this level the most unbearable experience as possible?........EUREKA! Why not just CTRL-C, CTRL-V the most annoying and attack spamming enemy?"". The boss experience is the worse in my opinion, looking wise they are very good, however their animations/move set are not enjoyable. (I don't thing this game has the most amount of bad bosses however a think it has the worse ones). The most stupid difficult bosses they all spam a 10 hit combo sometimes with magick, they have hit kill attacks that punishes you for not dodging that single attack, did I ever mentioned that they explode a lot? Or they just gank you to death. My point is, they're are very good quality however they are so unfair to a point you wish to never fight them ever again, and just skip them whenever you come face to face with them again. It's not a fun fight anymore like the older titles, it's just a burden really.
They took everything from dark souls 3, cranked up the boss speed and damage, decreased the Iframes window from the player and just kept the same speed for using the healing. Dark souls 3 difficulty config was good enough. I don't understand why Fromsoftware's games have to be so hard to a point that I literally just get annoying when you replay the game , dark souls 1 wasn't that difficult back in the day. I hate the ""GET GUD"" culture,it just makes these games unbearably difficult for no reason, I've already ""GOT GUD"", and it seems the game just gets worse every run.
Oh yeah before I forget, they have put a incredible feature in the game which allows you to respawn at a checkpoint without having to go back to the bonfire,if only they put them in the right places.
PS: For some weird reason Fromsoftware thinks that fixing some glitches that skips some bad bosses or boring puzzles which makes the game more dynamic and only affects MY EXPERIENCE ALONE is more important than fixing performance issues and  bugs that really cripples the gameplay experience, like clipping through the floor after a game crash and losing all the runes I got or just not being able to finish a questline for no reason.",1707932603,1708024808,False,1,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False

Elden RIng is quite literally my favorite video game of all time. It has substantially altered my brain chemistry and has me wrapped around its finger. It's gameplay, lore, and sense of immersion are so addictive to me that no matter what I literally cannot be pulled away from it. It's probably a sign of mental illness but hey, the DSM5 has classified gaming addiction as a disorder so it's less of a probably and more of a definitely. 
           Speaking of gaming addiction, the gameplay is like crack for the brain. It is so fluid and while simple to learn it is without a doubt hard to master. As a spiritual successor to the Dark Souls trilogy, it is to be assumed that it is hard. While my recent run through DS3 was significantly more challenging than my first time through Elden Ring it definitely was no slouch. It beat my ass first time around, Malenia took a whole week of on and off play to defeat. But that is what is so genuinely wonderful about the Soulsborne franchise. Once I beat Malenia I felt a rush of adrenaline and it felt like I had run a marathon (hyperbole, I have a life and do shower). All the bosses gave me that sense of achievement, its the best part of the game. You feel like you're in a dance, going through the motions with expertise and proficiency. I love the combat of this game and if every other game had this level of gameplay I would probably never get off my PC.
          Honestly however, its not the gameplay that had me wholly hooked, it was the god damn lore. Vaatividya is probably my most watched channel of all time just due to how hooked I am on the lore of this game. Fromsoft and George RR Martin have created a mastercraft story, every boss and enemy feel like they could have a whole essay written on them. Every item feels like it has this major impact and even the smallest details send me on a rabbit hole of speculation. There's this overwhelming sense of tragedy with the  demigod characters you see in game. From Morgott's blind alliegance to the Erdtree in spite of its system oppressing him from birth, to Radahn being a shell of his former self with his men holding a festival in his honor so he may die an honorable death. Every character feels like if the cards were just handed to them a little better things could be different which is why their stories feel so cosmically tragic. With how phenomenal the story is for the base game, I can only imagine what twists and turns the upcoming Shadow of the Erdtree DLC has in store. 
          The deeply entrancing lore mixes like butter with the fluid and masterful gameplay to create a sense of immersion I have never felt for a piece of media. Every time I boot up the game I feel as though I am being transported to another world running on a completely different set of logic. I feel as though I am the tarnished and it is my duty to mend the shattered Elden Ring. It is just such an enveloping world and I don't think I will ever experience something like it.
           In conclusion, please for the love of god buy and play Elden Ring. I am literally a different person after playing it and I cannot recommend it any more.

It's the most accessible and lowest-barrier-to-entry Souls-esque game I've played, but I think that is a downside. You'll probably like this game if you aren't looking to play Dark Souls. I was told to expect this game to be most similar to Dark Souls 2. It is not. It is an entirely different kind of game that I happen to also enjoy, but it does not strike me like a Souls game. It's just entirely different. But I do like it except for the lore that just doesn't hit as good as the Souls series.

I think you'll like this game if you're expecting a more chill relaxing Breath of the Wild-esque experience.
I think you won't like it if you're expecting Dark Souls.

Here is my original review for reference:

-------

""The game is simply not fun. It's lost the identity of earlier FromSoftware Soulslikes. It's easy, the setting is generic and uninspired, and the writing leaves very little to the imagination compared to the Souls series.

The world is bland. There's nowhere that looks particularly interesting to travel to. It's all one note-- beautiful green fields accented by masonry in various states of disrepair. Comparing the huge vista you get as you step into Limgrave to the view you get when you step into Majula (DS2) was gutting. The opening cinematic was run-of-the-mill fantasy worlbuilding. There's a map, a jump button, a mount, sneaking, gathering, crafting. There's nothing with any soul (pun intentional & pertinent) in Elden Ring. Before I even fought a single enemy in Limgrave, I was attacking random wildlife out of sheer disinterest, both in what I'd seen so far, and in what laid before me.

If I hadn't unintentionally left my game running while I got called away from my PC, I would have refunded Elden Ring near immediately. Truly disappointing.

Edit: Steam is unable to refund me for this game-- understandably so, since I was past the 2h refund window-- so I'm gonna play it more and see if my opinion changes. I'll change my review if my opinion improves.""

-------

I have played a bit more of Elden Ring. The game IS enjoyable, but it is not Dark Souls 4. The gameplay is fun, but faster-paced than previous FromSoftware Souls games (which I do not prefer). 

I think many mainstream game mechanics (Rideable horse, crafting, standalone jump button, world map, and more) just feel out of place in this kind of game. I am enjoying them-- except the horse, which I am avoiding using for my own enjoyment-- in Elden Ring as long as I stop trying to consider it to be similar to the Dark Souls series. But, imo, I shouldn't have to accommodate a FromSoftware Soulslike not feeling like a FromSoftware Soulslike to enjoy its thematically confused mechanics.

The difficulty is actually there... sometimes. The way the game starts is dreadfully easy. But there are very challenging bosses and even ordinary enemies can be difficult.

The main thing I feel 100% as negatively about as I did in my first iteration of this review is the writing. The world is not gripping in the same way the Souls series is. the Souls series (plus Bloodborne, even) has this nightmarish quality to its storytelling that I am just not seeing in Elden Ring, and that disappoints me. I love the nightmarish mystery of FromSoftware Soulslikes, and I think it is a massive downgrade that Elden Ring is veering so hard toward normal fantasy.

Overall:
- The game starts pitifully. It gets more fun after a few hours and you meet a few NPCs and die to some bosses. I remind you, I tried to return this game because the start was so uninteresting.

- The writing, the lore, and the world, are all much more bland, uninteresting,  fantasy than other FromSoftware games; the George R. R. Martin influence really shows. I consider the world the strongest feature of the Souls series, and here it is the weakest feature of Elden Ring. This is very disappointing for me.

- The game is fun to play in a sense. I am invested in my progressing my character, and in seeing what's up with Melina and Ranni-- I do love them as characters. Wandering around and chilling and exploring while paying attention to a YouTube video or TV show is enjoyable, but any engagement with the lore and writing and worldbuilding of the game is just so uninteresting. In this way and many others, Elden Ring feels to me like the soul of the Souls series is leaving its niche narratively and in terms of the gameplay loop, but holding on to the way it feels to control your character. This has its ups and downs for me. Mostly downs.",1707067454,1707966529,True,0,0,0.499383509159088135,0,True,False,False

There are four great bosses, two decent ones, and a bunch of Dark Souls 2 bosses.

To further explain: There are ""sci-fi turret"" style auto-tracking overheads aplenty from many bosses. There are many enemies and bosses who fully invalidate a damage type or playstyle, which in my opinion are both major fouls, considering the scarcity of resources and time to prepare a secondary damage type(a weapon or spells) and playstyle surrounding it. The metagame is a holdover from previous Souls titles, as Fromsoftware opted not to innovate upon their previous and various equipment upgrade schemes.

The least entertaining aspect of boss fights compared to past games, especially Bloodborne, is that position advantages do not last long, or are arbitrarily defeated by a sequence of attacks that explicitly requires you to perform exactly the same strat everyone else uses. This actually makes the gameplay feel stale on the PvE side, and I do not glean enjoyment from joining in on boss fights as most can just be stagger-locked into oblivion with minimal setup/effort.

Since the release of Prepare to Die Edition on Steam, there have been countless mods addressing a variety of valid and arguable flaws in Fromsoftware's implementation of upgrade materials and progression gating in that regard. Of course there is a balance to be struck as overpowering your weapons against the enemies in a level is a bit too cheesy for the fairly hardcore, elitist community. 

Fromsoftware either never checked them out, or felt confident players would enjoy spending hours farming just to enjoy a different weapon and ditch the one they were using for about a hundred hours, considering they put over 500 equippable weapons and high-quality movesets into the game. It is for this reason I consider this game an L.

The endings are very disappointing for the effort required to unlock the majority of them. They swap one line of dialogue at the end. Then you're back to the start, with little reason to do the majority of side content if already completed, leaving long jogs to bosses you wind up steamrolling due to weak NG+ scaling. Another big L and regression from past titles.",1645767918,1707952903,True,0,0,0.491071432828903198,2,True,False,False

It's truly amazing, From Software is the giga-chad of developers, almost making a mockery of western studios with the amount and quality of content on offer here.

Difficulty
I always liked from software games but I could never finish one. I know, git gud, etc. This is the first one I finished and I'm super proud of it. I see a lot of people crying in the forums that this game was easy. I don't disagree, it definitely felt easier then their previous titles. It was definitely easier than Lies of P, which I finished by some miracle. But to me this was the perfect difficulty level. It hit a sweet spot that it wasn't so off putting and I was actually motivated to finish it. I don't think it was a worse game because of this. On the contrary. They made a lot of improvements that just removed pointless punishment, like 10 minute boss walks. And you can always explore new areas if you are stuck on a boss.

 I killed pretty much all bosses in under 15 tries. Sometimes I explored some new areas and came back if they didn't take much damage.  
I did explore the game very thoroughly, so I was very high level in the end game (~150). But it's not like I ""farmed"" XP, I enjoyed every second of exploring the world, and it naturally leveled my character up. I did play a half knight half mage character, so that probably helped, strength builds seem more difficult. If you want to run through the bosses only, you might have a harder time, but why would you want to miss out on all that great side content?

Visuals and design
The art in this game is jaw dropping. There is a monumental vista on every single corner. It just doesn't let up, area after area. You think you are in the end game five times at least, and there are still more gorgeous places to explore, things to do.
The level design is also on point, it was a joy to explore. There are all sorts of secret routes to discover. And you are absolutely 100% free to go anywhere and play the game in any order you want.

Gameplay
The activities in the open world are not overcomplicated, thank god! This is where I feel like they distinguished their game the most from other open world games. They didn't feel the need to bombard you with some BS filler content on every corner. The world that they built is there for you to explore, but it doesn't cater to you. There is risk and reward everywhere, so the exploration always feels exciting, but sometimes you just ride your horse and take in the views. And there is nothing wrong with that. Less is more ubisoft.

The combat is great as usual and you can do it from horseback too in the open. Once you find your playstyle and build you can really get into the zone as you plow through the areas. There is probably a million builds you can try and replay the game forever.

As typical fromsoft, the game is very cryptic and don't hold your hand when it comes to game mechanics. This is fine for most aspects, but it didn't work for me  when it came to the side quests. It's basically impossible to figure out the side quests without looking them up online. The characters say some cryptic stuff, then disappear, then you bump into them in a random cave by  chance 30 yours later to continue their quest. If you are a completionist like me this doesn’t feel great.

Overall, I didn't want this game to ever end. What they achieved with this game is astonishing, especially the amount of content and art they were able to cram into it, and none if it felt like filler, it's unprecedented. They really schooled everyone how open world is done, and I hope devs are making notes. 
It is a time commitment for sure, but if you have the time to invest, there is nothing better out there.

I played the first 70h with mouse+keyboard, but finally did the switch to Xbox controller. Not going back. The game is clearly designed for console and even when playing on PC it makes sense to use a controller.

Every input is delayed and takes half a second to do, all NCP's have attack patterns that will hold off on doing their 1 hit move until they are just about to die so that you did all that damage, just to die when they are 1 hit away from death. They will also spam you with quick moves to pick at your health slowly, giving you no window to attack.

I was so excited for this game to go on sale, I waited, and hyped it up for 8 months, just for it to be a blatant rage game at a time where I'm doing my best mentally. Hard pass.

Edit - A year after this review, I gave the game another try. My thoughts have changed, although what I was complaining about is still an issue, just not in the way I assumed it was based off my short playtime.

I would like to extend on my complaints on the game and say that the enemies don't spam moves, they just have long combos that YOU MUST RESPECT because you cant stagger them out of the animation, and sometimes youll stagger them out the animation, and theyll skip the stagger animation, or cut it short just to hit you.......

There are countless videos on youtube explaining why the enemies moves in this game are far too punishing and the amount of fake windows there are in these interactions, so I don't need any kind of reassurance from anyone in this community that what I'm saying is true, just look it up for yourself.

80% of the content is at the very start of the game. The remaining 20% is dragged out through the remaining of the game with repeats, reskins, and reused assets.

I personally only find this game playable with mods. Lets not talk about how a game that came out in 2022 is limited to 60fps...... 

Overall, The game redeemed itself from my first time trying it, although all I did was force myself to play through it, to fully understand what exactly is wrong with the game. 

I am aware that there is no such thing as a perfect game, but there IS such thing as stupid game designs, and the fromsoft hardcore fans to understand that not everything in the game needs to be defended with ""its a souls game"" because they have changed TONS of things in the game after release which shows that none of this is as simple as ""git gud"" because even they are changing things after the fact...

Btw where is the dlc? this game is 2 years old... It LITERALLY should be out by now but for some reason, the gaming industry has regulated unfinished products and we all have gotten so use to it, we are still sitting here waiting for dlc for a game that released 2 entire years ago.",1671975868,1707873142,False,5,12,0.337833434343338013,0,True,False,False

This game does not hold your hand, but it has a beautiful world to explore and great challenges to overcome. If you are looking to get into the souls series, I highly recommend this game to you all. If you are  souls veteran and want a challenge then come on inside and put the difficulty on high! The game is great! 

Graphics  - Beautifully well done and captures a fantasy world unlike any other!
Music       - The Music in this game is very...ambient? It's nothing that overloads the senses, but when travelling the world, the subtle background music fits each environment well enough, the combat music is nice as well and it matches the tempo of what you're doing. 
Gameplay - The combat can be challenging, but without practice you can overcome it! I played this game mostly on the Xbox and recently got it for PC , have to say PC is the way to go, especially with mods =D. 

Overall I highly recommend this to all of you, get it while its on sale, get it brand new, either way, you will enjoy it.

I rate the game 10 out of 11

An absolute masterpiece and a giant of a game with a few faults. The camera and targeting can be iffy. Some rediculous spammy bosses toward the end coupled with a few empty feeling zones. A few obscure and hard to find questlines. The incomplete and fragmented dialogue of NPC's can leave you feeling lost or vaguely stranded or not sure what they mean or where to go next. I missed a crucial questline that I wanted to do and was actively looking for. I played 100% blind until I beat the entire game, so this was an especially rewarding but also daunting. The game is dreamlike and it's broken yet hand-crafted nature is part of the experience, but also in the scope and presentation of the landscape and architecture. The exploration, art, and atmosphere created by the team carried the project and create an unforgettable experience if you don't spoil it.

I recommend playing this game blind, or with VERY little info/spoilers.",1672499652,1707860970,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Unfortunately you will have to use this terrible lock-on to use almost any form of range (Spell and Ash of wars) IF, and thats a BIG if, your camera doesnt break lock for some mysterious reason. 

In short, the camera is the true boss of this game

Edit: 4th graders could probably make a better camera/lock on system in scratch. Fromsoft should be absolutely ashamed of themselves for allowing such an atrocious and detrimental thing to even be programmed into a triple A title. its painfully obvious that fromsoft thinks that adding new and innovative game mechanics will somehow hide the fact that they STILL have not fixed many of their issues (even the most basic ones) since darksouls and show no signs of effort or willingness to fix the things that NEED to be fixed. the camera turning, lock-on, and spell tracking during horse combat seem to be made by people who have never even heard of the words ""video game"". its so inconvenient that, what would otherwise be a near flawless experience, is overshadowed by fromsofts basic programming issues (caused the kindergartners they still continue to employ) that are still persisting from earlier souls boring games. its such a shame to see this amount of low effortness and what seems like shameless corner cutting is still a part of the souls boring series and that the atrocious camera and camera settings havent been rectified by someone on their team whos ACTUALLY PLAYED the game after 2 whole years.

Once again fromsoft paves the way on what NOT to do with your video game and continues to ignore polish that SHOULD NOT be ignored creating an infuriating gauntlet of inconvenience and constant feeling of being baffled by confusing and just straight up terrible game design that the devs seem to deem a non issue. Fromsoft consistently proves that they dont know how to program basic game mechanics and that they dont know how to fix them either.",1706939435,1707859641,False,4,1,0.508274853229522705,1,True,False,False

The enemies become repetitive, the areas are huge but poorly populated, and the bosses start hitting like a fucking truck (even with 50 or more vigor) while sometimes being outright unfair.

it’s not a flawed masterpiece or a rough diamond or whatever else the meme 2 hour video essays tell you, it’s just mid
DISCLAIMER: this is my second time playing this game, don't mind the hours, the first time i was doing the hand hook and eyepatch build

>open world
probably the best aspect of this game by far, you just can never get tired of exploring the lands between
one complaint about the open world i often hear is that you often find yourself just traveling way too much from point a to point b, but i don’t see this as a negative, since the game’s beauty alone is enough to keep your attention 
legacy dungeons are also good but that’s been said a million times already 
however, even this kind of open world is not without flaws

>copy paste
why does this game have 5 or so dungeon types?
no, i don’t want to explore yet another cave or a mine or some lazily copy pasted catacombs (sometimes with a chariot), but sometimes you have to, to get the smithing stones or that talisman you want
but it’s not just the dungeons that get copy pasted, bosses and enemies do too
can you imagine my disappointment when i got to the mountaintops of giants and was like ""holy, this area is so beautiful, i wonder what kind of enemies i'll be fighting in here""
can you imagine my face when i saw the caelid dogs, the caelid birds, the stormveil birds, the demi-humans, the bats, the marionettes, the hands, and the vulgar militiamen
a-at least zamor dudes became a normal enemy instead of a m-mini-boss, so it's at least ONE unique enemy tied to this area, r-right?
miyazaki, my brother in Christ, I HAVE BEEN FIGHTING THESE ANNOYING BIRDS AND BATS AND DOGS THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE GAME, I’VE KILLED SO MANY OF THE DEFAULT SWORD/SPEAR SOLDIERS, CAN YOU PLEASE ADD MORE ENEMIES INTO THE GAME
NO, YOU CAN’T JUST PASTE OLD ENEMIES FROM OLD GAMES, YOU DID THAT TWICE IN ELDEN RING ALREADY WITH ASYLUM DEMON AND CAPRA DEMON
i am especially sick of the copy pasted dragons, erdtree avatars are at least fun to fight
ROT DRAGON, ICE DRAGON, NORMAL DRAGON, MAGIC DRAGON, MAGIC DRAGON 2
ALL OF THEM HAVE THE SAME MOVESET
this is a triple a game, just to remind you
edit: there is way more copy paste from previous titles as it turns out, just today i found out about red wolf of radagon having the same animations as sif and the death blight frogs

>combat
this is where things get bad, such outdated souls-tier combat where it feels like you’re handling a bus instead of a human SHOULD NOT EXIST with such fast bosses that feel like they come straight out of sekiro
either make the player faster and give him more movement options, or make the bosses slower
it is infuriating having to dodge 5-10 boss attacks only to get ONE hit in and then repeat the cycle
torrent is awful to control, and it feels like he's not listening to half my commands
wow, it's just like a real horse!
the decision to make your stamina tied to torrent's is also bizarre and unexplainable
also, input buffering is more often than not the result of your character’s demise, as it's been countless times that this trash read my ash of war as ash of war + left handed attack after it and i died so many times because of this
before fromdrones shout “skill issue”, i am literally putting my hands off the keyboard after doing the ash of war and my character still does the normal attack after it
but, despite that, my character drinks only 1 flask half the time despite me mashing the heal button
i often miss the opportunity to reposte thanks to INPUT BUFFERING, so why not let the player know when the boss stagger is coming up?
you're gonna make a posture break mechanic without implementing at least some kind of sign?
i swear to Christ miyazaki has never played his own games
also, why do the enemies' arrows home in on you, yet the player's arrows don't home in on enemies?
do the enemies have special magnet arrows or something?
can some lore expert tell me how this is explained in the story?

>bosses
and these bosses, oh God, these bosses
delayed attacks, input reads (these are especially “fun” if you’re doing any run that involves projectiles), blatant destruction of established game mechanics, they got everything you don’t want in an action rpg
and i can't stress enough how awful the input reads are, the best bosses for showcasing such nonsense are margit for his combo extender that he won't do unless you attack and the godskins who shoot black flames at you IMMEDIATELY upon pressing the heal button
someone needs to teach miyazaki that's not how reaction time works
but, being completely honest, i had fun fighting malenia
sure, she is actually one to break established mechanics
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9Vbsr3Ko7M
but at least that boss has a unique feel and dynamic to it, akin to an old samurai standoff, where the two warriors exchange blows and then fall back to circle around each other
her attacks are more or less intuitive, and she does have a flexible moveset that’s fun to play around with on your part
EXCEPT FOR WATERFOWL DANCE AND VAMPIRISM, WHOEVER DESIGNED THOSE INTO MALENIA NEEDS TO GET FIRED FROM THEIR JOB ASAP, AND UNLESS YOU’VE NOT DONE SOMETHING AS ELEMENTARY AS BEATING MALENIA WITH A +20 CAESTUS, NO SUMMONS, NO SLEEP POTS, NO BLEED, NO FROST, YOUR OPINION DOES NOT COUNT
also, elden beast is the worst final boss in any video game ever, radagon was such a good conclusion to this mediocre, but still charming game, but nope, my face gets smeared with the broken unfun mess that is elden beast
he's constantly running away, he's not at all dynamic like radagon, and he even looks like crap
come on, who wants to fight a giant space spaghetti as the final boss?
also, ulcerated tree spirit
just ulcerated tree spirit

>story
average fromsoft fan be like:
OH MY SCIENCE IS THAT LE HECKING MIYAZAKI TELLING THE LORE OF THE GAME THROUGH ITEM DESCRIPTIONS FOR THE 1488TH TIME??? HOLY GOSH OOOOOOOOOOO ELDEN RING
seriously though, the lore of this game is admittedly pretty interesting, but the narrative sucks
to give an example, in the beginning we are shown a literal powerpoint presentation about the world
okay, what’s the night of the black knives?
not gonna explain?
oh, okay
i’m a tarnished?
i don’t even understand what that means
what the hell is an elden ring?
and so on and so forth
stuff like this continues throughout the whole game because the narrative feels like a jumbled mess of in-universe terms and seemingly random events
on that note, quest design in this game is unintuitive as hell
to take varre’s quest for instance, how the hell am i supposed to know that i need invade other players THREE times to advance his quest?
or patches, it’s like he’s teleporting around the map at random, he doesn’t tell you where he’s gonna go

>leveling
softcaps?
really?
at least tell the player when they get to them, so he doesn’t have to google it
i suggest this is due to pvp or some crap like that, but pvp is a portion of the game, not the entirety of it and you don’t balance stuff AROUND it
the smithing stone grind in this game is obnoxious because of what i described about the caves in the open world section
such game design is almost ubisoft-tier, and those are the items that actually get you through the game

>optimization
it is just bad
it is understandable why my fps are bad on medium settings, seeing distant lands is part of the charm of this game
but the crashes are inexcusable
i suspect it is due to the botched anti-cheat, since without steam this game didn't run half as bad

IN CONCLUSION
i really cannot recommend this game if you're into the ACTION part of the ACTION RPGs
it's a strong MAYBE if you're into the RPG part, but it's just simply so tiresome to even control your character
this game is just outdated, through and through, and i think we all know why it won goty
it is because there was nothing else better than elden ring
i mean, come on, you're gonna give it to god of soy?

100/10 Is actually playable.

Edit: I have now put like 200 hours into this game previous review is flawed like this game.
The game is not polished even a little bit and I'm 99% certain they never play tested anything, most of the bosses are just reused and multiplied the the point that it feels like quantity over quality.

The bosses that are big bosses are put in tiny little areas so it's like fighting a dragon in skyrim in the jarls house, it clips into everything and is a pain in the ass and designed to be unfun, flying bosses break the lock on camera because it was not designed for this sorta tracking, half the time with bosses you are running towards them only for them to teleport to the other side of the map and you run over there, hit them once and then your outta stamina.
Every Boss in this game is the same too, they are fast,tough,strong,have a projectile and an AOE they all just kinda blend together and this isn't helped by the lackluster story and the fact that bosses are reused so frequently, its not impressive beating Morgott(?) when you do it 3 more times.

Dragons are poorly designed and reused way to much, you can disagree but your wrong.

Co-op Still needs work but nerfs are the obvious priory not getting the game to play, invasions are a bad feature and have always been a bad feature and there is still no way to turn them off, you don't have to deal with them in single player but you could manage that in older souls games by disabling online so this is like a band-aid on an open wound.

Invasions are also busted with completely broken pvp ""builds"" and people who can destroy your save files and considering Dark Souls 3 had that RCE exploit then I'd say go online at your own risk.

The latter half of the game is broken enemies you had no problem fighting before now have 4x health and deal 5x damage despite there being no difference in model (the stone imps are a prime example).

No quest log just means I have to use the wiki to keep track of what the fuck to do so that sucks.

Every problem with this game can be fixed easily but it won't be because then it wouldn't be Dark Souls and that's all this is open world Dark Souls complete with all the trash from the souls game splattering shit over what may have otherwise been a good game.

The open world isn't fun to explore, every dungeon is the same and the bosses are ethier too easy because you over levelled or too hard because your under levelled and/or they are busted, getting good in the game requires you to learn how to code so you can balance the enemies properly.

Despite all these complaints its still one of the better games I've played recently and I still plan to play it some more, but goddamn does it feel like a chore.

Colosseum update is a huge pain in the ass and just doesn't work as advertised in typical Dark Souls style

4.5/10 so close to perfection but everything Dark Souls bogs this game down to being just another Souls game, nothing groundbreaking, nothing special, nothing that people will be talking about (outside of the souls community) in a couple of months, just another basic Dark Souls game but you can jump in this one.

Edit 2: i have now put in another 200 hours and my review stands, looking forward to when the DLC drops (never will) and all the bosses are just like Maleina where they have 30 hit combos and regen health, or the blood god who just throws blood on the floor so you can't play anymore, don't forget the dog with the busted hit box who will backflip into invisible walls while literally throwing you through said walls.

The first chunk of this game is pretty good and even great, its the final chunk of the game where they just decided to make enemies hard for the sake of being hard and not for being a challenge, like yea its a challenge to 1v1 someone with x-ray and aimbot in CoD but its not exactly fair is it?

But hey its fromsoft so they get a pass basically, they can do no wrong what so ever so souls fans just keep eating shit and saying thank you.

1/10 the longer you play the more the cracks show, I'd say get it on sale but its a fromsoft game so lol enjoy your wait.",1646058792,1707787521,False,1,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

Martin, emerges as a pinnacle in video game storytelling, heralding a paradigm shift in narrative depth and player immersion. FromSoftware's distinctive dark fantasy converges with R.R. Martin's expertise in elaborate world-building, birthing a game world that pulsates with life, sprawls expansively, and harbors a wealth of captivating lore. The scrupulous attention to detail in Elden Ring's story constructs a tapestry that enthralls players, beckoning them into an expansive and enigmatic landscape laden with secrets.

What truly distinguishes Elden Ring is its narrative adaptability and the player's agency within the story. The game embraces a non-linear structure, enabling players to mold the narrative through their choices and actions. The interconnections of the world, reminiscent of Dark Souls, fosters a sense of authentic exploration and revelation, infusing every decision with tangible consequences. Martin's narrative finesse, coupled with Miyazaki's design philosophy, produces a storytelling experience that is simultaneously grandiose and intimate, catering to a broad spectrum of player preferences.

Beyond the enthralling narrative, Elden Ring shatters preconceived notions of game development with its breathtaking open-world design. The sheer magnitude of the game world seamlessly integrates diverse environments, intricate dungeons, and colossal boss battles. The meticulous design not only serves the narrative but also immerses players in a dynamic, living realm where every corner conceals a story. This level of artistry not only sets a new benchmark for the Soulsborne genre but also establishes a precedent for the entire gaming industry, showcasing the potential of storytelling and world design to ascend to unparalleled heights in the ever-evolving landscape of interactive entertainment.",1707786849,1707786902,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Like their other games, it requires you to learn and triumph through trial and error with plenty of items, weapons, armor, and spells to help you out and find your favorite way to play. I've played a typical sword-and-board build, a faith-based incantation build, a quick dancer-like build, and a mage/wizard build and they all work and are fun to do.

The main problem I have is actually finding sidequest objectives and the characters themselves rarely give much or detailed direction.

I've done hundreds of hours in hardcore permadeath games like Diablo/Path of Exile and survival games so I thought difficult would be fine/fun.  

For me, the fact that you have to die to learn and then retry/avoid what you know is coming is NOT a style of game I want to play - it feels too similar to raiding in an MMORPG.  In Elden Ring, I saw one enemy in a room, but there was a hidden enemy just to the left that ambushes you as you enter.  Later in the same tiny dungeon, an enemy was hiding up on the edge of the wall.  

I think if at every death you had a chance to restart 30s ago, 60s ago, or 120s ago, I'd have given this game more playtime, but the long corpse run mechanic on top of respawning enemies and losing your corpse on a subsequent death was just more hassle than I want to deal with.",1707768674,1707769734,False,0,0,0.452275753021240234,0,True,False,False

Why in the bloody hell my game always causing stuttering with ANY actions???? Especially with that second Big Guy on the horse that every player faces in the first 10-15 minutes of the game. Every his attack animation causes my fps drop from 60 to 20. And my specs even stronger than recommended : Ryzen 7 1700, GTX 1080, 16 GGB RAM 3200Mhz, game installed on SSD NVME with read and write 520+ MB/s. My CPU and GPU usage not even close to 100%. I tried max and min graphics settings. 
For now, let's talk about gameplay and specially about NET CODE. Froms, how did you ducked it up? It works even worse than dark souls 3 release statement. Every (successful) summoning takes about a minute or two (my internet speed is 100 Mbps). But most of the time, when you already tried to summon a phantom every other try will fail and for some reason game gets stuck in that condition, you can't exit or chill at bonfire, only way I found is alt+F4 or death.
I am really disappointed in that poor technical release quality of that awesome game. This game should be in development at least a month more! For now i dont recommend Elden Ring to buy, but I really want to! Please FromSoftware, fix your game, and let people enjoy beauty of your passion!

Out of all the Soulsborne games FromSoftware made, Elden Ring has the best access to multiplayer due to the addition of Martyr Effigies and the ability to use them globally and the same applies to invasion items. (i wish the Martyr Effigies didn't get reset on NG+ though)

The invasion areas DON'T get reset on NG+ however to some players it effectively does due to the fact that if you die during an invasion, You drop your Runes wherever you died in that world which may be an area you still haven't reach again in NG+ so you can easily end up preferring not to invade at all due to the hassle of picking up Runes, The whole idea of dropping your Runes from death in another world is not a good one honestly.

Also multiplayer could still be improved by opening it to a max of 6 players instead, Which would significantly boost the PvP potential and the enjoyment of it.",1697959080,1707731568,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Fazla yeni oyuncu dostu bir oyun.
Oyunun size verdiği saçma sapan derecede bozuk şeyleri kullanmadan bile oyun zorlayıcı olmuyor ve bu saçma sapan şeyleri verdikleri için zorlaştırmak adına oyuna çok fazla delay'li saldırı koymuşlar, bazı yerlerde bokunu çıkarmışlar bu delayli saldırıların (örneğin mohg).

Oyunun en büyük sıkıntılarından biri de bossları. Oyunu oynarken bana istediğim zevki veren sadece 3 - 4 boss oldu maalesef. 2. can barları neden yok? Neden bütün bosslar birbirinin kopyası? Neden güzel boss yapmadınız bu oyuna? Vesaire vesaire... Şu oyundan Godfrey, Radagon, Maliketh ve Placidusax'ı çıkartırsak gerçekten boss kalmıyor, çok üzücü.

Oyunun BOK GİBİ bir haritası var, harita Ankara'ya benziyor. A noktasından B noktasına gitmek için ecel terleri döküyorum. Bazenleri acaba parkur veya puzzle oyunu mu oynuyorum diye soruyorum kendi kendime çünkü oyun daha çok o içerikleri barındırıyor.

Oyunda saçma bir lag var.

Oyunun iyi yanları da var.

PvP konusunda başarılı, fazla build çeşitliliği ve silah var.

Bonfire'dan lvl atlatılabiliyor.

Haritadan fast travel atılabiliyor.

---
This is the worst modern Fromsoft game I've played, and I've played DeS, DaS, DaS2 (and SotFS, played both), DaS3, and BB. Every one of those games held my attention once I got past the initial annoyance with the first one I tried (DaS). I have around 1200 hours across all 5 (6) of them. This game is [b]STRUGGLING[/b] to keep my attention and I'm barely a quarter of the way through as far as I can tell. I am almost ready to just throw in the towel and uninstall out of sheer apathy. Having to force myself to play a game is never a good sign.

[u]The Good[/u]:
- Looks good
- No performance issues in borderless fullscreen for me (surprising considering how widespread they are)
- Added mechanics are nice (jump attack, guard counter, etc.)

[u]The Bad[/u]:
- Nearly everything else

So what do I mean by that? Let's start with the combat. This is DaS3 but with 33% Bloodborne enemies and 33% Sekiro enemies. I know I say that having not played Sekiro, but I have watched several full playthroughs of Sekiro and I don't need more than that to see the similarities. The game is [i]begging[/i] for a quick dash and deflection to allow you to actually play aggressively and proactively instead of having to bait 2/3 enemies into exhausting their combo before moving in. This is especially apparent on bosses, who have way more combo potential than ever and fewer openings. Yeah, you can just bait the combos out and wait 30s for Margit to finish his hit string or whatever and punish but it's [b]not fun[/b]. Not after Bloodborne, not after Nioh, and I'm sure those who played Sekiro would say not after Sekiro. Let me engage with the combat defensively and reverse the enemy's aggression. They can do the same to me, so why can't I do it to them? ""Oh but you can parry some-"" You and I both know that gets nerfed later on and is somewhat build-reliant. For most people, what you end up doing is rolling and zoning for tens of seconds before doing a quick punish, then repeating for 3-5 minutes to get a boss kill. Boring.

How about exploration? Also boring. There's not much to find when killing enemies gives almost no runes (souls) and 95% of all loot is useless to you. The world has what I call the ""Kenshi problem"" where it's beautiful and the lore is great but it's basically non-interactive. You might as well be looking at it through a bulletproof glass window because you barely interact with it at all except to kill stuff. In fact it's worse in ER because there's no building or trading. Dungeons are samey, even the few I've played, and I've already seen boss reuse. Due to the upgrade system there's also zero incentive for me to experiment because all it will do is waste resources (runes that are a pain to grind and better used on leveling) and time. This cost also increases with time because, say, if you want to change over when you have a +15 weapon you need to grind a LOT more than if you changed when you had a +6. It's just backwards design in a game where you [i]will[/i] need to change tactics for certain encounters.

What was that about stats? Yeah, so, they matter but you gain them so slowly that it feels like you're slogging uphill constantly, and the game is balanced around you needing to level which makes this worse. In addition to getting hardly any runes from combat, you also need more than in any other souls game to level up, compounding the poor pacing. Also, unlike a game like Nioh 2, your stat allocations early on REALLY matter in this game and you need to pump VGR to avoid getting oneshot. For all the balking about skill from fanboys, a surprising amount of this game is havng the right stat layout. Ain't no skill gonna make a boss fight less awful if you've only got 10VGR short of perfecting it. Same thing with damage output, if you screw your stats even a little say goodbye to ""quick"" kill times. Even previous souls games weren't this bad about stats, ER is the most heavily build-biased of them by far.

The story also isn't drawing me in much. I get what it is, it's impossible to have not been spoiled on it by now if you cared at all, but even when I heard it initially it didn't impress me. Maybe I just don't like GRRM, but even S1-4 of GoT was watchable for me. This story is like someone reheated the corpse of every souls game since DaS, threw them in a blender, then added gold flakes on top and crossed out the word ""souls"" and replaced it with ""runes"". I just don't give a damn about ""Vague Miyazaki Stereotype Character #2397"" muttering incoherently in a modern knockoff of ye olde English. It was tired by the time DaS2 rolled around, it's practically a parody at this point if you've played the whole series.

[u]In Conclusion[/u]:
I just don't know man. Playing ER makes me want to go back to Nioh 2. This game really, really needs a better combat system (like Nioh 2), a smaller open world (because most of it is empty or pointless), and just better balancing of incentives and character building in general. All the issues with ER existed in previous games but their impact was limited or softened by the world design, enemy design, and better encounters. It really just feels like an awkward middle-step of a game, stuck between what it was (souls) and what it wants to be (something like BotW). I don't know if that's because the devs aren't competent enough to realize the mistakes or if it's because they want to appeal to the fans and got too much flak for Sekiro being different, maybe it's a combination, but it doesn't work. 

I even looked into mods and, while I think something like Reforged might be a lot closer to what I'd consider ""good design"" for this sort of game, I don't see much that addresses the core issues with enemy movesets. If anything, most make them worse in an attempt to be ""hardcore"" if they change them at all, missing the point entirely that without a full mechanical rebalance of player abilities the changes just amount to more tedium. It's not generally hard to stand 50ft away from an enemy to avoid their combo, roll their AoEs, then slap them once or twice. Anyone can do it. The issue is that it's not fun.

To make my point, let's consider Nioh 2 again. Every boss in Nioh 2 except maybe the few gimmick bosses like Gyuki and the giant statue guy are pretty much Margit-tier in terms of their combos and moveset. You [i]can[/i] fight them the same way you would in ER, by running away and punishing once or twice for minutes and minutes until they die, but Nioh 2 doesn't want you to do that. The bosses have stamina bars, you have a powerful guard no matter the weapon you use, you have a bazillion moves with different speeds and 3 stances with different kinds of dodges for repositioning and extra yokai abilities that can do anything from utility to punishment AND ki pulses so you can be more aggressive and get longer hits strings out and... etc. All of these are present regardless of build, builds just add even more onto it. The entire game is screaming ""GET IN THERE, BE AGGRESSIVE, READ THE FLOW OF COMBAT AND TAKE CONTROL!"". BB also had this to some extent with rallying and quick dodging and the general pace.

Meanwhile, ER's mechanics are saying ""Wait, wait, wait, wait, not yet, not yet, not yet, okay now hit once! Now wait, wait..."" It's different for mages of course, you can just blast away, but that's not really better. The enemy design and combat mechanics are at total odds with each other, and the end result is not fun. Same with the open world vs encounter design vs looting, same with the stats vs resource availability, and so on. At the end of the day, it's just not that good compared to what came before it and other games you can buy right now. Kinda wishing I just picked up AC6 instead.",1707703237,1707703367,False,5,1,0.480424284934997559,0,True,False,False

Pro: 
It's a souls game, the open world design is amazing, every point of interest has somethings useful to collects, exploring the world is fun and never feel the same on multiple playthroughs.
There is no path you have to take, you can just choose what ever route you want to progress, if you feels like you're too weak just go to a different area.
Most weapons, skills, spells feels fun to use. In fact you can clear the entire game by just spamming skills/spells and not using normal attacks. 
Just use what ever you feel fun to clear the game, if it's in the game then they're meant to be used, there's nothing cheap about summons or spamming skills.

Cons : 
After beating the game 13 time, I have to say some endgame bosses are just not fun to fight, they are overly aggressive with weirdly long wind up attacks and big AoE attacks, too many reused bosses (looking at you foreskin duo), the difficulty design fall flat after Leyndell.

I don't care how good the Malenia fight is, she's utterly BS and is what's wrong with FS ""hard"" boss design. She breaks so many fucking rules like no other enemies in the game, she can cancel her animations, she heals even when you guard and take no damage, she can input read like she knows today's lottery numbers, she instantly gain hyper armor from most of her attacks which feels so fucking random, she has way too much HP for someone who can heals and has hyperarmor in almost all her moves which pretty much force you to use status effects, summon, powerstance if you want an easier time, none of the other bosses are like that, you can reasonably beat all the bosses with even just a dagger because no other bosses heal 1k HP per hit while having 33k HP and infinite hyper armor, her AI behaviors are inconsistent, sometimes she'll just be super aggressive during phase one even though she's not suppose to, sometimes she won't attack you even if you stand still, Waterfolwer is suppose to trigger when she lost about 30-33% HP but that's not always the case, sometimes she just won't do it and then randomly do it later so you just have to die, she don't even fucking dodge away before doing that move so the player can actually have time to react because she's suppose to be ""hard"". She's literally a DPS race, the longer the fight the worse it gets which is not the case for any of the other bosses in the game because none of them breaks so many fucking rules. There's no amount of copiums can justify her terrible design. She would have been a great Sekiro DLC boss, but not a souls game boss because she's literally does not fit with the boss designs of the series.

The sidequest design is HORRIBLE, I missed the raging wolf armor set on two playthroughs, you will miss out items if you don't use wiki to check how and when to do all the sidequests because some quests are gone after you killed the boss of the area.
The Catacombs are fine to clears on multiple playthroughs but the Hero's Graves are simply not fun to clear after the first time.

But the last bit is just a slug fest of boss after boss, and when you already have a maxed out weapon and are at a high-ish level, going from level 145 to 155 isn't really gonna change anything, so you just have to keep trying. Bosses kill you in 2-3 hits, and you need to get a lot of hits in, so a lot of boss battles are just you rolling around and hoping to get a hit in every few mn.

Do I suck at this game? Absolutely. It was my first Soul-like, and I now know I do not enjoy trying the same boss fight 50 times in a row to learn its timing, or at least not when there is 5 of them in a row with basically zero content in between.

The unicycle is an entirely different system of balance, and even mounting it is wonky. It is mechanically restricted, slower, and if your objective is to ride a wheeled vehicle over a distance it is objectively worse.

[h2] Difficulty [/h2]

The game is not difficult in a way that's considered unfair or requires you to grind. It does offer a constant challenge from beginning to end and rewards smart and innovative playstyles. The game additionally provides you with so many useful tools that makes the journey a much better experience and even sometimes just outright trivializes certain mechanics. 

Don't be afraid of using your consumables, you can always craft more thanks to the built in crafting system. Absolutely no reason to save them for ""that"" moment because you will save yourself so much time and mental. Always use them when it feels you could be using them to make things easier. 

The game also introduces a mechanic called summon ashes that allows you to summon spirits of certain NPC mobs to help you out, mainly against bosses. Use them whenever you can and don't listen to anyone that says it makes you a noob for needing their help. Its a very fleshed out game mechanic with its own upgrade system, it was meant to be used, its not a ""cheese"" at all. Have fun experimenting with them all.

[h2] Exploration [/h2]

This game must have the best exploration of any game I'm familiar with. The map just keeps getting bigger and bigger. Even when you say ""there can't possibly be more"", well guess what, there's always more and then some. 

The world is immensely beautiful that you'll find yourself wanting to explore every nook and cranny on your own. What's even more crazy is that quite literally you get rewarded with something by exploring every nook and cranny, whether it is a shiny new weapon, summon ashes, armor or even upgrade materials. 

There have been complaints that certain late game areas have less and less things to do and explore, namely the snow areas, however it does not undermine or undervalue the sheer size and scale of the possible explorations you can do. Those few areas still have a lot of charm to them. 

[h2] Bosses [/h2]

Bosses are extremely well done and each main or secret boss offers a unique experience and feel. Different people will struggle with different bosses depending on their build, playstyle, type of summon, and if they're using consumables which makes the game all the more unique in experiences and offer so much replayability. 

There is criticism to be made about reusing minor optional bosses commonly, but for the most part it makes a lot of sense. It is impossible to create hundreds of unique bosses with each their own mechanics, design and lore without making the game overwhelming. It is also much better for the player to be familiar with a boss due to past encounters making your experiences and knowledge acquired have value. In my experience however, each encounter feels new with repeated minor bosses as there is always something new to learn in addition to them having some extra gimmick attached to them. (Except for Godefroy fuck that reused lazy excuse)

[h3] Some tips for new players [/h3]

Level up your vigor stat (health) early on as it will yield the best results by far. Upgrading your main offensive stat won't matter much in the early game since scaling starts to pick up later. 

Don't go crazy about losing your runes when dying, its not worth the mental and its definitely preferable you try out a different tactic and overcome the challenge rather than worry about your lost runes over and over again till you rage quit. Runes are not a scarce resource and is always in abundance especially if you explore a lot. 

If a certain enemy or area is too difficult at the moment, don't bend yourself backwards trying to complete them. The open world aspect allows you to go explore other places and come back stronger with more levels, better weapons and upgrades. 

Don't go too hybrid leveling up your stats, focus on one offensive stat and a just as needed in the others so that you meet the requirements of your favorite weapons and spells.",1700653976,1707656305,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False
1245620,158075933,76561198035432851,0,13,8040,0,8040,1707653278,"Elden Ring is by far the most approachable FromSoft game to date. The traditional Git Gud mentality is shoved to the background in favour of open world exploration, albeit with a clear intended path due to enemy scalings per area.

Visually it is extremely pleasing with amazing vistas in most if not all the major areas of the game (aside from maybe Caelid, that nightmarish hellhole earned its reputation). Enemy design and visual effects are also top notch. It is understandable that enemy and area designs are reused throughout the game, but some are a little overused, especially the Catacomb tileset becomes incredibly repetitive. They have been compared to shrines in Breath of the Wild/Tears of the Kingdom and i'd say that comparison is pretty fair, but far from flattering.

Now, let's talk gameplay. Is it perfect? Absolutely not. The game has plenty of playstyles but some bosses later on in the game will pretty much force you to adjust your approach if you wish to stand a chance. Sadly, this includes the final boss in my opinion. On the other hand, certain weapons and spirit ashes (looking at you, mimic tear+10) can trivialize a LOT of otherwise challenging areas/bosses. This may sound very negative but it is honestly rather nitpicky in the grand scheme of Elden Ring. For i'd say about 90% of the game you are free to take any approach, and that is nothing to scoff at. Another note, some of your attacks can have generous hitboxes, but beware, some bosses have very unforgiving hitboxes to balance it out. My personal experience with PvP is Mohg's favourite word, NIHIL!, so I will refrain from touching on that.

Moving on to audio. FromSoft is pretty (in)famous for the epic scores during their bossfights and Elden Ring is no exception to that. Besides those, the main area themes lend well for immersion and rarely get on your nerves (aside from once again Caelid, but that one is fully intended to keep you anxious). 

Dialogue is surprisingly frequent, with a lot of NPC's to speak to and do quests for if you so wish. I would subtract points for calling me maidenless a multitude of times but its actually pretty funny. Oh and the screams/noises the player character can make for all the different ways you can (and will!) die are almost frighteningly good.

The final point I'd like to bring up is the story. As we are used to from FromSoft, the game takes a Show-Don't Tell approach for the majority of the game. There are plenty of cutscenes but most of them will do very little to explain anything, aside from the introduction cutscene (ohhhh~, rise now, ye Tarnished!). To some, this approach is lackluster as they would rather be spoonfed a story, but to me, FromSoft, with the help of Georgie, have delivered a sublime world with fleshed out characters and lore that goes deeper than the deepest trenches on earth. Be warned, very few characters will get a happy ending, but come on, it's FromSoft and the man behind Game of Thrones, what did you expect?

All in all, Elden Ring is a sublime game with mountains of content that will keep you entertained for over a hundred hours if you let it, and it is eye-pleasing throughout. It has definitely a few flaws, some of which run deeper than others. Thank you for making it this far into this rather lengthy review. Now, let's finally give the game a scoring, shall we?

If they'd remove the mount and 85% of the map, but keep the loot and the enemies the game would be 20% better.

If they'd keep the 15 remembrance bosses and made them appear only once and keep the 12 required boss, let's see keep another 15-20 unique bosses and only add like 1-2 repetitions of them, so only 60-70 bosses would be available instead of 165, that would make the game another 20% better.

If they'd design the bosses with one player in mind and without the mount as it would be removed in the first point and not make the player run after scared bosses for minutes, that would make the game another 10% better.

If they'd remove the crafting materials from loot and made them only obtainable like the flowers and other stuff and made the lower tier crafting materials more common and not only in the first one or two areas it would make the game again 10% better.

Only these four points would make the game so much better, sometimes less is more.

I don't mind open world games, if done correctly, here everything is just a big bloat and I barely remember a couple of bosses, catacombs and mines and whatever else. This game feels also a bit shallow, but much better than Hogwarts Legacy.

Exploring is not rewarding as all the good and important items are right in front of your eyes as soon as you try to explore and get off the path you only find boring crafting materials.

When professional players constantly cheese bosses  to beat them (the duo khm, but there are others) then it is not a good boss design. (I have easily beaten them with the golden greatshield and antspur rapier, not even fully upgraded, 4th try on my first playthrough, did I beat them? Yes. Was it a fun fight? No. Did I feel the accomplishment? I mean I applied rot to fatty, then facehugged the pillars and ran around, wait for him to respawn two times sounds like a big skill then sure, but no.

Story? What story? I mean there is a story, but not a good one. Sadly I heard about G. R. R. Martin participation only later, otherwise I wouldn't have bought the game, it shows in the story though. Miyazaki should have kept his non-writer hand in this. Whatever.

It is clearly a console port: can't use mouse on the map, you have to use E, enter, mouse click doesn't work in many cases, some menus can only be navigated by the arrows not W A S D, clunky controls with the pouch and so on, pretty annoying, could've been better if they'd do a proper port not just a lift and shift approach.

Targeting got a bit better as it is not as aggressive and stiff with the camera, however got much worse as well, because now it is so easy to change targets you cannot really lock on, makes a mess, room full of passive enemies only one that is already aggroed, closest to me and in the center of my view, targeting targets the passive enemy behind the aggressive one, in the corner of my screen, making me vulnerable to the other one. Simply hitting the button resets the camera, which still sucks as it is very fast confusing and usually happens when I want to target the enemy in front of me, but it turns me 90 degrees away from it, making my character vulnerable again. 
Why targeting then you may ask? Because I have a 2,5 meters long huge sword in my hand that I swing horizontally in front of me, the enemy is so close that I cannot move forward and I still miss 6 hits out of ten, previous titles provided an 80-90% accuracy as melee so I only used targeting for casters, in this game you need it almost all the time.

Input lag: always feels like you are playing with 500 ms ping, sometimes when I hit the button once nothing happens, as timing is key it ruins some of my fights immensely, input queue is crazy too, I hit the button, enemy hits me, got me flying I couldn't get up quickly as my previous input is still in buffer so hitting space doesn't work, I get up and recover in 3-4 second, which is a lot and then my action triggers too, just to make it easier to the boss to kill me.

Gamebreaking bugs even after two years: Greatshield pokey pokey you get no runes...
I have found 3 somber smithing stones 7, 2 disappeared from my inventory, same with comet azur spell and god knows what else that I haven't even noticed. (No it is not in my storage, I'm sure I looted the items as I watched multiple guides after the incident as I assumed I remembered wrong, but no) Never happened before in these games. 

I don't even want to replay the game, I don't want to make a new character and try the bosses again to see how much better I got or how much better the new build is. I was like thanks god this boss is over with and I don't have to fight it again and I didn't even struggle with them that much, ok I wasn't using summons, because it would have made the whole thing laughably easy. I played previous titles multiple times, I only stopped because it kinda sucked me in and I couldn't do much else, so I forced myself to stop playing those games, this one? I forced myself to play it through at least once, so I can write a proper review. Oh and I had to use guides to be able to progress, not to mention the terrible scaling and whatnot...

I could go on forever, but I think my review will be too long again and I will not be able to send it.

Is it bad? No, it is just different, so I think for many others this game would be great, for me not so much, but thanks god there are different type of games so everyone can enjoy something and everyone can be happy.",1707651621,1707652400,False,4,0,0.456331878900527954,0,True,False,False

The game expands what in my opinion was greatly lacking in the souls series, and that is open world and exploration. I have always hoped to find a game that would combine the beauty of open world of exploration of a game like Skyrim, but would also incorperate the enjoyable and difficult combat theme of the souls games; moreover, this is the a big step in the right direction for the souls series theme in my opinion.

The character customization is streight up souls style, but enhanced with a bit of greater freedom. The introduction of the skill system allows the player to define to some degree what weapon art they want on their weaponry, though I wish there was a bit more freedom. This is a great boon to me, as playing my spellsword like I did in Dark Souls 2 required me to be able to both parry and reposte with a right-hand weapon; however, getting used to the timing of the parry is a great trial just as it was in the other souls games. I have not found all of the war ashes yet, but the list is getting bigger, and the options are a very welcomed addition. Spell slots are another thing that typically required a great deal of character levels to have any variety, but now they are key items instead of being tied to any of the stats. This will allow me in the end to have ten spells like I did in Dark Souls 2, but without the wasted stat points in a certain stat. The enhancement to co-op has also been well done, in activating summoning pool items allows you to use an item to send your sign to any active pools, making it possible to explore the world and still get summoned to random dungeons. The days of sitting by a certain bonfire with your sign on the ground are gone, and that is really needed change given the open world aspect of this game. Another addition is spirit ashes that allow you to summon various spirits to fight and pull some of the aggression off of the player, making it less tedious to solo some of the bosses. The combat feels very much like Dark Souls 3, but without every enemy's attack being in hyper speed mode; moreover, giving a welcomed feel of a blend between the Dark Souls 2 & 3 enemy attack speed.

The world so far has been beautiful and vast, and they were kind enough to give you a horse to travel and fight with on the open world map. The addition of harvesting resorces and crafting items, along with the various dungeons and sites of interest very much remind me of exploring Skyrim, and that has really added to the joy of the game. I still have not yet explored all that much of the map, and non of the underground area, so there will be many more hours put in this game before I'm done. If you are a souls series addict, then you likely already have the game, but if not this is a great game that to me combines to some degree the greatest aspects of Skyrim with the renowned combat system of Dark Souls. An awsome game, that so far has ran quite well, but I gave them almost a year to patch it up before I started playing. All in all, it is a great game to get lost in with tons of hour of fun and frustration; however, the difficulty is souls inspired, so rise and rise again until lambs become lions.

Three hundred some hours later and am still loving the game, especially since they expanded the spellsword type magics. This has been a fun, but frustrating character build that wasn't an option to this extent in the other souls games. Great game, but have had some crashes while being summoned and odd screen issues during starting and closing the game that I wish they would fix up. Ready for the final boss and the journey of seeing all six endings with three different character builds. A great way to extend the life of the game out and finish the last of the achievements over another year or two.",1656330352,1707648041,True,2,0,0.529220819473266602,1,True,False,False

It recaptured for me that wonder and joy from the magic of video games from my youth.  This game is an objective, unquestionable absolute masterpiece and the crowning work of Fromsoftware studioes.  

Elden Ring was my first Souls Game, and I have to confess it was a rough start.  I actually came very close to requesting a refund 30 mins into the game.  I am SO glad I gave the game a chance.  The problem with this game is that, instead of a learning curve, the game has a learning CLIFF to brand new players.  But if you are patient, and willing to do some work to scale that cliff, the rewards are great.  

My advice to new players:  1.) DO NOT attempt to fight the Tree Sentinel until much later.  I wasted 2-3 hours when I first booted up the game trying to fight him, and thinking this game was awful and not for me.  He's there to basically troll you, and teach you that you can skip challenges in this game.  

2.) The game does not hold your hand one iota.  It is expected that you will need to furiously look things up online.  It is expected that you will need to watch YouTube videos on how to get through a cave, how to find an item, how to dodge a specific boss's attacks.  

3.)  There are so many ways to tone down the game's difficulty if you are not a Souls veteran, but it's just less obvious than a difficulty slider in the menu.  You can use spirit summons to make boss fights significantly more manageable.  You can play as a mage, magic typically has an easier start (though not necessarily easier by mid-game).  
 
There are so many great things about the game.  The lore that is revealed little by little via environmental storytelling is fantastic.  The creators understood that things are cooler if you leave some things to the imagination.  The art, the boss and enemy variety and designs, the combat, everything is fantastic.  One of my favourite things about the game is that it gives you SO MANY paths, so many ways to become a powerful god-slayer.  There are many ways to awesomness in this game, there is so much variety, and it feels so different.  In my first playthrough, I played as a Dex/arcane samurai.  I started a new game as a mage, and the game feels like a completely different game, so different that I'm not bored at all.  The fact that this game gives so much enjoyment and fun for one base price with no microtransactions and no add-ons is unbelievable.  If you beat a boss you can obtain their armour and weapons to ""cosplay"" as your favourite boss. This is the type of ""skins"" that a lesser studio would charge you real-world money for, yet Fromsoft gives it to you for free.  

Elden Ring probably isn't for everyone, but Fromsoft really did make an effort to make this their ""most accessible"" souls game ever, so I think most people who like video games will probably be able to get a lot out of this.  The game is as easy or difficult as you want it to be, and that's a good thing.  Anyway, I highly recommend this game!  It is a masterpiece.",1707633004,1707633004,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I remember picking it up at a K-Mart that is now sadly closed. I even went to go get a slushie and some popcorn with my mom so call it a core memory, I guess. Anyway, what followed after that was a journey that legitimately took me almost more than a month to complete. I achieved the link the fire ending and was rewarded with some beautiful music and respawned back in the undead asylum to do it all over again. I played each and every single souls game, including bloodborne, sekiro, and even armored core which isn't a souls game of course, but you get the idea. 

So, when I heard that Miyazaki was cooking something up with GRRM, the creator of one of my (formerly) favorite tv shows and book series, I knew we were all in for something special. Then comes an amalgamation of what made all of their games great. Stealth, powerful weapons, flashy armor, spells with convoluted names, and weapon skills that let you do acrobatics that would make Sekiro jealous.... I remember thinking my mage build in dark souls III was something special until I saw the absolute monstrous builds you could make in this game. 

The main core that makes fromsoft games great is that they give us the tools, but it's up to us to figure out in what ways we can use them. The builds that are capable of existing in this game are indescribable and it allows the player to respec their levels into anything they want, thus making the possibilities nearly limitless. 

The difficulty scaling with this game drastically changed from previous iterations. Essentially, reaching level 40 in previous souls games would make the player rather formidable during early game since everything was so linear and the difficulty would steadily rise. Given the fact that elden ring is open world, the player can easily run into a boss that's far too difficult to fight right off the bat and forces us to go out and explore other places so that we can level up and come back stronger. Being level 40 in Elden Ring is like reaching level 20 in earlier souls games. Granted, the game forces the player to level vigor, because the late game enemies will absolutely one shot everyone. 

Despite all that, there are so many tools to use in elden ring and it grants us every chance to succeed. Though people bitch about the game being too hard, it just simply takes some effort to look around, level up, and also simply git gud to advance. 

Lastly, let's talk story: it would take someone as based and unhinged as GRRM to come up with a world like this. The man gave no fucks when he killed off the Starks in Song of Ice and Fire, and he gave even less fucks when coming up with this depressing, but amazing world. In typical Fromsoft fashion, the player lands in a world that has fallen to ruin and it's up to them to save it, form it into their own vision, or simply destroy it all. So far, I've achieved two endings and will probably end up going for the other ones as well. The sheer amount of self-interpretation is what makes his games so great. Letting the player fill in the blanks is often criticized as lazy storytelling, but I feel like it just takes some patience, which is what a lot of people seem to lack these days. 

Anyway, I recently finished another playthrough. I did as many side quests as I possibly could. Finished Ranni's quest again because of the moonlight sword. Did Fia's quest to get the Fortissax boss fight and I even fought Dragonlord Placidusax for the first time. Who knew that I would find out what it would be like to fight a Boeing 747 that could breath lightning? Coming up next in this game should be a DLC. Whenever that is. Either way, I'll still be waving the fromsoftware banner till I die. 

...Or until they release a game that has a battlepass. 

With that out of the way, 10/10 would play again.",1707619661,1707619661,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Please god make it so that FromSoft never touches ""open world"" bullshitery again.  This ""experiment was a massive failure, even though FromSoft fanboys eat it up relentlessly.  If this is the future of FromSoft souls-likes, I'm fucking done with them as a company.

It doesn't impress me when one of the selling points is 100+ or whatever dumbshit catacombs and caves and mines and whatever the fuck else, because all of that fucking sucks, and the vast majority of it is indistinguishable from one another.  There are maybe 1 or 2 unique catacombs/caves/mines that try to differentiate themselves from the rest, AND EVEN THOSE AREN'T WORTH PLAYING BECAUSE THE REWARDS ARE SHIT.  If I'm judging this game purely on what parts were enjoyable as to what is offered, the best I can give it honestly is 4/10.  The majority of this game should not exist, and the time put into it was completely wasted.  DO NOT BUY THE HYPE.  The main quest is great, but even it could've been better if the team wasn't so far up their own asses that they thought players would love to fight the same enemies over and over and over and over and over and over and over again as bosses after some half-assed side dungeon nonsense, all for a shitty item that only 1% of builds would ever find any use for, and not even enough souls for half a level up.

Here you will find verdant green forests, scarlet barren wastelands, gloomy blue marshes, glowing volcanoes, golden cities, and white snowy tundras. This is an extremely generous game. Where one might think they'd find a long winding corridor of enemies and traps, you'll be pleasantly surprised with more unique and expansive areas to explore and fight in.

Being in an open world game that requires exploration, but will lock you out of certain story-lines and missions if you progress too far or don't do the right thing at the right time or have an enemy (some can be challenging) kill an npc (sometimes when you're not even around). 

Graphics are dated compared to Lords of The Fallen Etc. 

Dated technical features like no wide screen support, etc. 

Having to depend on mods for some quality of life things like better coop is not ideal.  The devs should just pay the modders and incorporate their stuff.  Maybe make it optional in the settings for people that don't want it. 

Having to farm runes is a bit of a chore.  Ideally this would be better implemented in the exploration / playing of the game.  Chasing a ball or having the big metal ball chase you around for several hours so you can get enough vigor and stamina is not ideal.  I like the fact that the the rune farms exist since the game would be a massive pain otherwise.  I think that being able to re-farm bosses and harder enemies would be a better way of doing it.  Perhaps a special tower or something you could do for that.  That way you're still working on your combat skills.  Maybe a modifier-gamble mechanic for extra runes to keep thing interesting. 

Having a rune recall item, spell, or special church/location that was spaced out like larval tears or the rune-substitute-sacrificial-twig would probably better than the sacrificial-twig.  I know there are mods that let you reload your saves, but having something in game would help out quite a bit.  
^^^^I enjoy the mini-bosses and hard enemies that you have to work for, but there are some times in this game where you can get blind-sided by a very hard enemy and you need to stop and go farm runes a bit to ""git-guOoud"".  Not quite as bad as some of the Dark Souls games, but still annoying for a new player.  Your invested runes from exploring are basically a sunk loss while you try to farm and you pray you don't make a mistake while your farming or you lose both your farmed runes and the ones trapped behind a golden boss wall or in a dangerous area with a semi roaming boss.  Like when a Dragon comes down from the sky to smash you when you are going to clear out a low level mob on an island or when a Black Knife Kindred basically does the same in a blizzard.  

Some of the weapons, magic, and items don't seem to scale well?  Even something called the God-killer Great-sword or something may be lackluster.  However other items are fantastic / borderline op.  I actually hope they buff instead of nerf because if it wasn't for the BloodHound's Fang being absolutely kickass  I would have returned the game. 

I understand the dark mood and setting to create tension.  However there are moments in this game that are beyond dark and depressing.  This would be fine if the story-lines had slightly not as bleak endings.  Currently the game is setup that if you finish the quests you're not *really* going through hell / dark situations in order to make things better... you end up putting a lot of hours into something and the story mostly leaves you at a question of if quite a few things were actually made worse by your involvement.  Not that you have too much of a choice.  Your character is mute (which is fine, I guess that helps with immersion for some folks) and does not have a lot of text options to shift dialog or actions to a more positive outcome (not fine, there should be more involvement) except for a few side-story-lines.    The problem with these side-storylines and the ""good"" ending is that the game doesn't let you see much actually getting better.  I realize that there may be DLC on the way and that there is only so much time and $$$ that the devs can put on quest outcomes, but since it's really easy to sink 50-100 hours+ in this game it would be good to see a little more positive cause-and-effect.",1707584474,1707589242,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Fortunately, this game lived up to the hype as it successfully evolved not only the Souls formula but the open world of The Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild. The open world in this game is close to perfection in my opinion as it is not made up of FOMO style content but genuinely worthwhile sights, quests, and thrills that can be indulged in by the player at whatever pace or manner they want. Furthermore, it improves upon BOTW's world by having multiple handcrafted dungeons that greatly vary in scale, design, and necessity (i.e., the majority are optional) but are all uniformly excellent as a result of some truly incredible level and enemy design. In typical Fromsoft fashion, the combat is also fantastic with lots of depth and satisfying mechanics to play around with. The excellent combat is further complimented by great build variety with many cool weapons, magic, incantations, and ashes of war to try out. My only complaint would be that the boss fights are a bit of a mixed bag with a select few matching From's best, many being quite middling, and some being incredibly unpleasant especially during the late game. However, this is a minor complaint because Elden Ring is a triumph of game design and the rare case where a game manages to cement itself as an instant classic.",1707571436,1707571436,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you are looking for a game that gives you a lot of freedom, full of secrets and challenges in your adventure, then this is the game to buy!

I did my first play-through as a Dexterity Samurai with some basic faith incantations which made for some really epic moments and now I am trying something new now in NG+ as a Mage and after I think I'd love to do a colossal weapon run, WHO DOESN'T LOVE A BIG SWORD! 

Loves:
- The progression in the game feels super natural
- It is very challenging
- Epic Bosses!
- Super rewarding when you clear difficult bosses!
- Lots of build variety
- Unique Weapons

Dislikes:
- Ulcerated Tree Spirit
- I get disorientated sometimes
- Limited spell diversity

Things I'd like as someone that primarily plays PvE, and doesn't know how this would affect the game would be a wider spell variety, I'd love for more utility spells (and I don't mean buffs) but like a shield spell that creates a magical shield instead of just a enhancement or spikes from a ground or something neat! 

I absolutely adore super basic non combat spells, like the little light one for caves is a really nice thing.

Overall I highly recommend trying this game and this might just be one of those games I would really love to 100% and try experience all it has to offer.

Certainly helps to have the wiki open as many things aren't explained to you, in fact, you hardly know what's going on half the time. A refresher in the lore of different areas is always good to read up on to better appreciate it, but isn't necessary.

Pros: graphics, combat, exploration
Cons: no ultrawide screen support, limited to 60 fps, story is indecipherable, quests don’t make sense, occasionally the game freezes for a second or two (only on a very beefy pc, it’s absolutely fine on Steam Deck)

I start to get extremely bored around the 20 hour mark, every single time. I tried a tank, a dex build, and a mage. The game just feels so vast and empty, like I'm just running around killing everything that moves for no reason. Its an absolute chore to play.

The exploration element was cool at first, but when I realized that most of the time my reward for exploring was an item or weapon that doesn't fit my build, it kind of bummed me out. The combat and graphics are cool, but that's really all this game is; constant fighting in a cool looking world. It gets tedious after a while, given how big the world is. 

I have almost 2000 hours in DS3 and maybe 1000 in DS2 (between vanilla and scholar) and a few hundred in DS1. I love those games, but I just can't get into this one. I really tried. I'm Uninstalling and I regret the purchase.",1707520586,1707520743,False,2,0,0.499383509159088135,0,True,False,False

2) The game does not look good or technically impressive enough to justify the constant lag spikes on my PC which could handle far better looking and more technically impressive games. Wouldn't be an issue if the game wasn't also very hard (meaning a bad lagspike can and will kill you). Oh and it has no pause which means you can't pause through the lag spikes. And death is really punishing so you can be bullshitted out of all your runes at any point.

3) The game is hard but in a bad way, the base game is incredibly easy but the boss fights are huge difficulty spikes the base game did not prepare you for. So you have the choice of throwing yourself at a boss over and over until you win or explore the rest of the world and getting bored to death. In the middle of doing the latter I decided I had better things to do.

4) Every ability is so incredibly lame, like I restarted the game when I realized faith-based casters got a fireball (yes the game does the infuriating ""pick a class with no context"" thing, AND magic-user roles are the opposite of most of fantasy with faith being the cool one). Then I got the fireball and wow how do you make a FIREBALL lame. Sorcery just gets to fling blue baseballs.",1707466843,1707466843,False,0,1,0.451876193284988403,0,True,False,False

Now then. Please, for the love of god Fromsoft - 

PUT A TOGGLE IN THE OPTIONS MENU THAT LETS ME DISABLE THE COMPASS 
(without turning the HUD off entirely, obviously)
There's nothing intrinsically wrong with having a compass - but I HATE IT. 
It's like trying to drive my car with a huge muddy stain across the the windshield.
 
Take a staff member or two off Fires of Rubicon for a day, and patch this in, plz, FFS. 
(and have them add a vignette disabler too while they're at it, that'd be good)

I truly don't understand the mentality of this design decision. You built a big wonderful game with great visuals and plaster a big ugly Skyrim-esque NSEW on top of everything, and hold my precious HP and STA bars hostage by making them tied to the only option that fully disables the compass. Which, as i mentioned before, involves toggling the ENTIRE HUD.

and before some pathologically incurious bootlicking little dipshit saunters along to tell me ""Hey dood! Itz not a big deal!"" - YES! dipshit, it is (in fact) a big deal- It's in your face the whole game. Unnecessarily.

I harbor no bias for the company or the genre. That being said, Elden Ring was immediately one of the best games I had ever played to date. Sure, the learning curve is steep, but never have I had so much fun dying over and over. The challenges in this game are an enjoyable kind - minus points for a few (the 'wicked sort,' namely Maliketh for myself.) The bosses in a Souls game are unprecedented as the history goes, but therein also lies in Elden Ring an enamoring sense of discovery and adventure, puzzle, awe and most importantly, triumph! It feels so good to finally get that boss you've been struggling with down, and to the point of the adventure; you always want to turn and look at every corner along the way you go knowing that FromSoftware has fully fleshed out every area in this world and you don't want to miss any of it.

Somehow this game can enrage me to hair-loss and still be the most engaging game I own. I have been stomped by a boss for 3 hours, and still kept trying. There is not a single feeling comparable to beating that boss, and looking forwards to the challenge of the next one. The world is diverse and well-crafted, and I honestly didn't notice the recycled content until it was pointed out to me. Even then, they remain thematic to their areas and move-sets regardless of similarity. The Tree Sentinel, Draconic Sentinel, and Loretta are all the same model. Yet, all 3 feel distinct and their moves  require a completely different approach. There is a meta, but every single build can work with enough patience and skill.

Aside form the souls-like clichê; when side quests make you question your choices and feel sad for the now passed npcs or enemies, that is definitely a good sign. World building is at the same time beautiful and melancholic as all things should be.

It is another game that falls under the ‘SoulsBorne’ genre but sets itself apart from the others with how open the game is and how much freedom it gives you to play how you want and go where you want. Everything in this game is top notch with the worldbuilding, lore and combat. Characters are fleshed out even with minimal player contact and so many details that you might miss. Boss fights are brought to a new high with so many unique fights and the satisfaction received from beating them. The game is outright stunning to look at and always surprises you with how much there is to do and explore and always rewards you for doing so. I loved learning every little trick or bit of lore in this world. There were so many details in every quest, item description, enemy and even aspects of gameplay. It’s been a while since I played a game that left such a large impression on me, and it would be all I would think of playing when doing anything else.

It isn’t without flaws though. Side quests are difficult to keep track of and the way to progress some isn’t always obvious. Weapons are all so unique but stat requirements are steep where you are unable to wield most weapons at the start of the game. Late game weapons means being built incorrectly to use most new weapons without having to use a large number of resources and time to change your build and find materials to upgrade a new weapon. I found myself opening the wiki a large amount so that I wasn’t wandering aimlessly when trying to complete quests or look for important materials. As fun as some of the boss fights are the game has a habit of repeating them with only a few tweaks which makes exploring feel a bit repetitive as the boss will be something you have already fought, a late game enemy or dragons with just different breath attacks except the two remembrance ones.

It is a game I highly recommend as it was just an amazing experience, and my gripes are minimal to how much fun I had and engrossed I became. Though I understand it’s not for everyone, like those who don’t have the patience to see all what the game has to offer. It was a great time and I my hopes are high for the upcoming dlc.",1707384869,1707384869,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

What is left to say about the game that everybody loves? Personally, the game reminded me a lot of old PC RPGs - Might & Magic 7 and 8 in particular, which I fondly remember from my childhood. In those games, the world felt dangerous and alive. You could walk off into any direction you liked, and you might just get killed by a horde of ogres that are completely out of your level. An attempt to clear an early quest could turn into a harrowing journey deep inside a labyrinthian catacomb ridden with the undead. Any victory won feels earned.

A good game with a great amount of things going for it, but also far more flaws than one would expect.

-First, the movement feels a little sluggish compared to the other games despite the player moving at about the same speed. Not an actual game issue inherently, but especially compared to the speed at which one jumps, it feels weird to me- just a little off-putting. Not too serious.
-Second, the meta is utterly broken. Now I hear what you're saying- ""That's not Fromsoft's fault""... it kinda is when if you don't carry a strict few weapons and/or stick to spell, jump attack, or Weapon Art spamming then you won't get very far in the PVP meta. Damage is at an all-time high, which means that anything less than 60 Vigor is within one-shot range, which is definitely taking away from the game. The imbalance strikes this game straight off the roster of PVP games.
-Third, the physics engine just feels... vague? You'll die from a fall pretty much whenever the game feels like it. I'm positive there's math in there, but it just feels inconvenient.
-Fourth, this is only kind of an argument against it, but its bosses utterly destroyed the Fromsoft formula. Darkeater Midir in DS3 set the record for the highest HP of any souls boss at 15,860 health... then Elden Ring brought along a boss with 59,174 HP. 15K is just barely over the average for the later-game bosses, it's not even close to a record. I'm certain you can see why this is unsettling.
-And finally, the game is as good as does false advertising. Of the hundreds of ""bosses"" in the game, nearly half are just normal enemies with boss bars, but even the remaining ones are mostly repeats- only 8 are unique.

Don't get me wrong; the plot was pretty good, the game was beautiful, and I love most of the PVE, Co-op, and playstyle, but I personally believe for the aforementioned reasons that this game wasn't exactly GOTY material. I'm open for debate on the things mentioned though.",1707354914,1707354914,True,1,0,0.511930584907531738,0,True,False,False

I prefered building new characters up until a suitable PvP level (150 for me) so I could switch characters for different playstyles. What I love most about Elden Ring is how it included everything great about the Dark Souls series and managed to improve upon it. Build variety, how playstyles also feel different to each other.

But it also took a few shortcuts that made the game feel really stale after putting hundreds of hours in the Souls series. Many enemies in Elden Ring have the (exact) same movesets as enemies in the previous games. This includes mini-bosses and regular foes alike. Just before the last zone, you are basically fighting the same type of enemies in long strides of the game. There is feeling of tediousness, more so the ice regions. Many of the early game 'bosses' are just late game enemies. This made NG+ feel a bit of a redundant task compared to the Souls series. But many lategame enemies are also just early game enemies with boosted stats. So not only do we face the same types of enemies multiple times over, a large part of them are recycled enemies from previous games. This made the actual pool of cool and interesting fights, a lot smaller this time around, compared to the Souls games. It can make the endgame feel frustrating the first time around. And a core the third.

But all of my complaints about this game... are after 600+ hours of playtime. This game does nearly everything great to amazing and can easily be improved upon in DLC, more so in a sequel. For half the playtime the game looks like a painting whenever you travel the landscape and find a spot where the view is amazing. First playthrough where you don't hyper optimize your build yet and play with what you find, instead of hyperoptimizing your build on future playthroughs. There are so many items, builds, discoveries, challenges and story elements in this game that make repeated playthroughts an absolute blast, and most of them can optionally be ignored to save time for those that want to certain area's faster. Either by map knowledge, or intentially (by design) find certain items that allow for those skips. Instead of one thing, it is impossible to do a true no-maiden run (yet), which denies certain challenge runs, it literally blocks of the second half of the game, while still giving the option ingame. - I got too far into it only to figure out I wasn't alone...

Second is the implementation of PvP which isn't forced this time around, which is a good thing for newer players, and newcomers to the series. It allows you to progress the game without having invading players kill a hard earned progression run. Yet it also doesn't push a broader audience of players into learning to fight in PvP, nor gives the incentive to learn to PvP early enough. This game sadly promotes PvP players to become MUCH stronger, with specialized builds (for that level range) that makes it very hard for progression players to deal with them one-on-one. But it is much more in the background this time around. You actively have to seek out multiplayer in Elden Ring, to enjoy it.

Compared to Dark Souls 3, which in my opinion has better overal dungeon design, Elden Ring managed to interest me for far longer. Elden Ring managed to do 'true' exploration right, and rewarded story clues in the form of interactions with npc questlines that start to make more sense (as tradition) in future playthroughs, often with the wiki open longer than we'd (I'd) like to admit. The story makes much more sense at first glance, but is deeply layered with loads of mystique you will figure out after watching the lore video's (again). 

Absolute A-grade product, from start to end, with the endgame slightly underwhelming compared to the first half of the game. Which is where the re-use of stone imps, giants, abductor virgins, and various other early game challenges, start to feel stale. Even its most unique and frustrating mechanics can be countered, if you figure out how. A true dungeon crawler, but now in an open world. Can't wait for the DLC, sequal is a guaranteed buy as well.",1645782269,1707338990,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

One of the problems with this game, is the size of it. Yes, I know; you get more value for your money. But a very large sized world like this, imo, needs a little more variation. In every new area of the game you come to, it is basically the same. Get rid of the enemies, and go finish off the boss. 

I have played through DS1 and 3, and I for one, liked DS 3 a bit more. I don't think a big open world like this, suits a hack'n'slash rpg like Elden Ring is, like it does other rpg adventure games. 

One of the reasons for this:

The NPC's and their stories.  After you first encounter them, you'll run into them again by chance, every now and then. It may be so many hours since last time, that you don't even remember exactly who they are anymore, and what they were up to. 

The game doesn't give you any journal to track anything. If you have played Souls games before, you know this , but for those of you who never have played a Souls game before; you have to Google a lot.

The stories of the NPC's are too fragmented for my taste. And if you don't remember to exhaust their lines, they will not progress in their quests/stories. And because of this, I find I don't care about many, or any of them really.

If you don't play what/how the devs would like you to, or designed the game for, you will miss out help from NPC's in some boss fights, which is really just stupid. You may find out that you forgot to got there,and talk this or that NPC. And no help for you.

Having said all this; it is a great game, if you like hack'n slash rpg. One of the best around. 
It's so big, it's easy to get a bit lost, so Google will be a good source for many things.

If you are not familiar with Souls games, and/or don't want to be invaded by other players; play in off-line mode.

Rating: ⭐️☆☆☆☆

As an avid gamer, I had high hopes for Elden Ring, especially considering the hype surrounding its release. Unfortunately, my experience with the game left me utterly disappointed and questioning the accolades it has received.

First and foremost, the graphics are far from cutting-edge. In an era where we've seen breathtaking visuals in other open-world games, Elden Ring falls short with its lackluster and dated graphics. The character models are bland, and the environments lack the detail and realism that one would expect from a game of this caliber.

The gameplay is another major letdown. Elden Ring boasts about its challenging combat, but it often feels clunky and unresponsive. The controls are unintuitive, making it frustrating to execute even the most basic attacks. The supposed depth in combat mechanics only adds unnecessary complexity without adding much enjoyment.

The open-world design, while expansive, feels empty and lifeless. The lack of meaningful side quests or dynamic events makes exploration a tedious task rather than an exciting adventure. The world is filled with generic enemies, and the repetitiveness of encounters quickly becomes monotonous.

The narrative, touted as a collaboration between Hidetaka Miyazaki and George R. R. Martin, fails to deliver a compelling story. The lore is convoluted, and the characters lack depth, making it difficult to invest in the overarching narrative. The promised epic tale turns out to be a convoluted mess that fails to engage players on an emotional level.

Furthermore, the inclusion of the open-world elements feels forced, as if the game is trying to check a box rather than offering a genuinely immersive experience. The result is a disjointed world that lacks the coherence found in other successful open-world titles.

In conclusion, Elden Ring falls short of the high expectations set by its developers. The subpar graphics, unpolished gameplay, lackluster open-world design, and underwhelming narrative make it a forgettable addition to the gaming landscape. Save your money and invest in a title that truly delivers on the promises it makes.",1707310977,1707311854,False,3,6,0.327071517705917358,2,True,False,False

Elden Ring is a wonderful masterpiece, yet plays some rather common themes in fantasy RPG games. You are the chosen one, go kill god. However where it differs is that it doesn't serve you power on a silver platter. You have to earn that power yourself. To start you get a variety of basic weapons to choose from and are thrust into an odd world, post societal breakdown. You must explore the wasted and current structures, still guarded by those cursed to watch them. You must find the power and skill to succeed.

I myself, did not originally find that power. When I first started, I looked up what the most powerful weapon was I could get my hands on (Bloodhound's Fang if you're curious) and I gunned it through the story as fast as I could, only getting stuck on 2 bosses throughout the whole game. This is certainly a way you can do it, but not a good way. Unlike the previous souls installments, with the open world aspect brings a curse, you get overlevel yourself and your gear and steamroll the competition. It makes it easy in an otherwise notoriously difficult franchise. I regret doing that on my first playthrough, and I would like to offer to others ways to prevent that. So the from here on, here are some tips to make your playthrough more enjoyable and consistent to the franchise.

3 weapons to outright avoid on your first playthrough and the reason why:

  1. Bloodhound's Fang - It not only has an insane multi-hit skill, but it is one of the highest scaling weapons in the whole game, and you can grab it withing 5 minutes of starting the game, or better yet, take 10 minutes and you can have an npc kill the enemy for you, and you get the sword for free.

  2. Rivers of Blood - You might have heard of this one, and perhaps that it was nerfed. But trust me, it was only nerfed from game breaking to massively OP. It can clear almost all main bosses withing seconds. And although you can't get it until half way through the game, I would still recommend you stay away, as it's power only becomes stronger the farther you go. It was also inspired by the murimasa, so if you know the background of that, you get the idea.

  3. Reduvia* - Now this is a special entry, while it is an exceeding powerful, super early weapon, it is held back and reigned in by it being a dagger, which some could argue makes it ok. However, just to explain, you can get it also withing 5 minutes, just like BHF (number 1) but also an npc can kill the enemy for you. It's skill is a slightly weaker, but ranged version of rivers of blood's skill. So it is still no shortage of OP throughout the whole game. although a very fit choice if you prefer daggers, but find it difficult to learn the moveset with such a short weapon, while the game tries to slaughter you all the same.

Next, 3 places to be weary of should you find yourself there:

  1. Mohgwyn's Palace - Achievable to access right after Godrick through an npc questline, it might seem logical to assume that its ok to explore such an area as soon as you can, but be warned. Moghwyn's Palace is the 2nd highest scaled area in the whole game. It is a challenge to level 80+ players, let alone under 30, shortly after the first shardbearer. While it does house some truly magnificent loot, certainly reachable if you know the right path, do note most things will kill you in 1 hit, and enemies here are VERY aggressive.

  2. Deeproot Depths - A bit different from the first, but still requires some thought. While deeproot does not pose a huge threat on its own, it can lead to some very nasty places elsewhere. Beware of coffins and portals here, many of the destinations are, shall I say, interesting to travel through. 

  3. Haligtree - Now, of course, many of you may already know about this place, but I'll give a few pointers regardless. If you remember, Moghwyn's Palace was the 2nd highest scaled area in the game, well, Haligtree IS the highest scaled area. I wouldn't recommend coming here on a first or second playthrough till at least level 100, or above if you still struggle with bosses often. That being said, there are countless pieces of fantastic loot here, some behind super difficult bosses, others right out in the open, free for your taking.

Lastly a few individual tips, not regarding the same topics:

  1. Bows and Crossbows - While it may seem at first that bows and crossbows would be an ideal weapon choice for new players, do not be fooled. While they are a great tool for exploration and dungeon diving, they are (aside from 1 crossbow) almost useless for most boss fights. As to why, well there are a few reasons. Firstly, limited ammo. you can only carry 99 of each arrow, and while that does sound fine, it brings us to our next point. Secondly, scaling. Bows simply do not scale well at all. most will gain a maximum of 70-80 extra damage at the top end of its scaling stats. and crossbows, well they don't scale at all. That's right, AT ALL. there is 1 crossbow that shoots 3 arrows at a time, which is ok at applying status effects, but, using 3 times the ammo consumption, is not ideal. And lastly, the overall damage is very low on either weapon. 140-150 damage is rather high for most bows and crossbows. 

  2. Magic - On the contrary, magic is a great option for new players. There is a lot to be said from being able to stand back and pelt enemies with pebbles and magic blades. Limited resources do come into play, as unlike arrows, which you have to buy or craft. FP (the mana stat) regens fully upon sitting at a grace. However, it also it alot easier than melee, with many easy builds pertaining to ravaging bosses in seconds. Certainly fun to play, but about 3 levels of OP under the 3 weapons stated above, with a few spells exceeding them in power. Same goes for incantations, however they have a much greater use in buffing and healing than damage, so I find Faith to be a much more balanced stat.

  3. Some BS - As the name may imply, some things that happen in this game are, well, BS. Let's call this my complaint section. I only have a few. #1, certain bosses difficulty are only an issue because of how much they run away. Several required fights would be cake if it did not either run or teleport to the other side of a huge arena. #2, sometimes death is unavoidable, with or without skill, examples being certain frame attacks of a certain fat boss, while not always a death, is almost always a hit to me and others I've watched. Another would be a certain large boss somersaulting over you, even on Torrent (the horse) you will get pancaked without fail, again not always death, but almost always a hit. #3, dragon breath-like attacks can hit you 2 or 3 times even though you are locked into a falling animation after the first hit. 95% of the time, if you get hit once, it is a guaranteed death, and there's nothing you can do about it. And lastly #4, a truly 1 sided complaint. Some map geometry just isn't that good. See a jump that looks easy? Nope, you slide down a wall and get pushed 4 feet to the left our of nowhere, then missing the platform and dying. or a certain jumping puzzle, where you land on a flat surface, stand up, and proceed to slide off and die before you are able to do anything about it. There are other examples, but you get the idea. 

So, do I recommend the game? Well of course! I love Elden Ring and can't wait for the dlc to arrive. I will likely pass 2000 hours just exploring the dlc, and will almost certainly edit this review after the fact. There are some small flaws, sure, but this is as close to my perfect game as anything has gotten yet. I would certainly recommend it. A quick last tip, if anyone happens to be on the fence, Elden Ring is almost always half off during steams big yearly sales (spring, summer, fall, winter, and christmas sales) and occasionally 20% off)",1661510437,1707302300,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Open World: 
-really only makes sense and is fun if you're on a NG+ run.
-Your first playthrough you will end up going to higher level areas, clearing them, and then going to lower leveled areas later only to destroy everything easily. It's not really fun and I wish they just kept it semi-linear so you would get a natural progression and ramp up to the end.
-Tolkien helped in the design of the map.. which is great, I love LOTR, but my god is it really open and really empty. Basically just rolling plains with scattered ruins and a few major cities/areas

Enemies/Bosses:
-Seems to be a huge lack in variety. Many repeating enemies, many of which are copied assets from previous games with a reskin
-lot of repeating bosses but good variety 
-dont like that some bosses only appear at night and changing to night time is pretty annoying since you have to do it every time you die

Combat:
-classic souls combat
-way more hitbox issues than previous games
-jump mechanic inconsistent success rate
-seems the Ai doesn't understand charged heavy attacks and wont try to dodge/block/or parry them, they just walk right into it
-DELAYED ATTACKS ARE A BORING AND UNINTUITIVE WAY TO MAKE THE GAME MORE DIFFICULT. Every fan of this game will endlessly argue that it adds difficulty for ""Souls fans"" but everyone hates it. Nobody actually fights like that and sitting in front of a boss whos holding his arm in the air for 10+ seconds or having a boss jump in there air, float for a few seconds, then come back down is more annoying than challenging.
-Spirits

Weapons:
-more weapons that are just pointless and unusable
-policy of ""if everythings broken then nothing is broken"". Every class of weapon (including magic) has unbelievably broken weapons and I feel kind of forced to use them
-less scythes makes me sad

Weapon Upgrades:
-Classic upgrade system but instead of using stones to obtain effects (heavy/sharpness/quality) its stances which is interesting but odd
-smithing stones arent scattered the way they are in other games, they put most of them in mines which you have to find.. kind of annoying but it works. I had to end up googling where some of the mines were because I had the stones to level up to 20 but was missing the stones for 8-10.

Magic/Pyromancy:
-really cool spells in this game compared to previous but it seems kind of broken sometimes the way you can end boss fights instantly
-pyromancy basically non existent, uses a completely different system than previous games. Overall seems less prominent

Menu/Settings:
-No native Ultrawide support which is unforgivable for a game that came out in 2022. It was in the game on launch and then they took it out. So if you want to change the .ini or download a mod to make it ultrawide you will be locked out of online play for suspected cheating
-You can change the combat and movement controls, but not the menu controls. So you can never change that Q is how you get out of menus instead of Escape like it is in EVERY OTHER GAME. 

Map:
-You can't open the map in combat which is incredibly frustrating while navigating an open world full of enemies. I get that you shouldn't be able to teleport in combat but not being able to open the map is a poor choice
-The custom markers you can place on the map don't have enough variety to be able to remember what they mean when you return to them and they dont show up the way location markers do so you have to place both to locate a custom location. Not very intuitive.
-You can place up to 4 location markers at a single time which is nice

Story:
-Its a souls like so I don't ever expect much story telling but its just okay in my opinion. Felt like I cared more about Souls 1 and 3. 
-The choice not to make a opening cinematic to describe each boss like they did in previous games is kind of sad. Its just a slideshow of images, no videos.. feels like a lack of effort.
-Some of the endings are unnecessarily hard to achieve and some are unnecessarily easy to achieve. The bad ending in DS3 took so much effort and genuinely felt like I was becoming the Dark Lord whereas in this game you become the Dark Lord by simply hugging a 3 fingered hand.

Overall:
Feels like an uninspired, empty, repetitive, lack of effort version of Dark Souls. Feel like I have to force myself to play it and enjoy it. There's a lot of weird choices in game design and it feels like FromSofts entry into an open world game so it seems like there's a lot of cut corners. It doesn't have the quality or polish that the other games have and it really doesn't feel like a passion project like their other titles have been. If this is your first game in the series you will probably like it and don't get me wrong, many people love this game (Souls fans included), I just don't. I love DS1 and DS3 and DS2 really grew on me and I would much rather play those games than this.",1707295836,1707295836,False,6,0,0.470487713813781738,0,True,False,False

1. Non-rewarding Exploration. this issue comes up alot when learning the game and because the game is SO big and SO long this issue ends up double dipping. Once when your exploring your first time the scenery is lovely and nice, but big visual spectacle is never my thing in video game. If im exploring i do it to fight more bosses and find stuff to add to my build. during the 1st yeah the bosses felt unique enough to slog through the copy paste dungeons and boss fights. Every other playthrough however absolutely not once you know that this dungeon is there and will provide nothing it becomes pointless.
2. Replay-ability. As touched upon in the 1st point this game is big and you will miss dungeons & side-quests all the way up till your 3-4th run throughs of the game if your searching naturally. This results in alot of time spent memorizing where the stuff you like is for future playthroughs.
3. PVP. I played DS3 for 3 years after the Ringed city got released only playing invasions and pvp. Somehow there were almost 0 improvements made and in fact it somehow got worse? ofc the netcode will never be fixed that fine but when you hit hit the invade button the game 7 out of 10 times will put you into the open world. Bugged Weapons, Poor Netcode, Open world invasions, No rewards, and a surprising amount of cheaters make it unsurprisingly not fun. This shits making me go hollow
4. Boss Design. Elden ring departed from the rest of the souls series boss designs in BIG ways. 
Bosses have extensions to their combos which they only use when the player either attacks or heals. In the rest of the souls games you could actively engage the boss and deal damage without getting hit. No one is calling those games easy in fact most souls veterans thinks elden ring is one of the easiest, But elden ring isnt a graceful dance like its predecessors instead its a waiting game. GOD FORBID the boss dodges away after you waiting for its window i mean SERIOUSLY why does every remembrance boss except for rykard have a way to get away from you and STAY away from you. Fire giant, Maliketh, Morgott, Rennalla, Radagon, and Elden Beast. Even Horah Loux one this games best bosses has several moves which will keep you out of melee for 10-20 seconds.
5. Scaling. Instead of throwing your self at the problem and improving as a player it is heavily encouraged to go away and come back when your stronger... thats not a skill issue thats a design choice. 
6. Build Crafting. in pvp is as good as the rest of the souls games but pve? different story if you choose a weaker weapon and dont use elements and status some bosses become a slog fest. If youve played the games you know the ones. Their the bosses the community has put after ""the wall"" which is a very big damage and health increase in some areas past mid game. Want to spend 8 minutes fighting fire giant? i dont think you do.

In conclusion this game is a masterpiece, Please let the DLC have more legacy areas/dungeons instead of open world.",1707264890,1707265094,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

both game-play and story are unoriginal and boring. Visuals and sound designs are the only good thing about the game. 

weapons: 
     some look cool, others look plain stupid but have some unique trait/ability to it. but most of the ""ashes of war"" and most of the weapons (even the unique ones) were boring after 5 minutes.

armour:
     all the armour (besides a few bits) in the game looks great.

magic:
     incantations: some look good and are good, some look really stupid but are good (every dragon communion incantation), and some look good but are trash.
     sorceries: kind of the same thing as what i said about incantations. except all of them are visually and/or functionally boring compared to the description.

character creator:
     dog shit. it works terribly and the default characters are hideous.

Likes:
- I like that there is a new souls game. (And how it introduces new mechanics and old, alike.)

Dislikes:
- Bad performance, stutters, lag, freezing. 
- Open world feels.. bland. Sure, you can go out and find useful things, but even though it's open world, any and every game is always linear, so I guess there's that, but I find myself wanting to know where to exactly go to complete the game (still haven't played much).
- Not sure if the input lag is worse, or what, but I noticed it on this game versus other souls games. (Pressing a button and noticing an obvious delay between the button pressed and action happening on screen, gets me killed).

The entire premise of the game being intentionally hard acts like a shield that the developers can pull out in order to deflect any valid criticism of the game, whether it from me or anyone else. This entire game is so big, but there's literally nothing to do except loot and kill people like a Mongol, and do side quests that give good items for characters that are extremely forgettable due to a lack of personality and emotion, and especially given the fact that likely over half of them die at the very end.
Reusing content is the main way Fromsoft ""populates"" the place with content, the regular enemy you just fought is probably a boss with a little more health and damage in one of the many repetitive dungeons outside of the purposely unique ones, and vice versa. Hell, they even reused the first demi-god, Godrick, for an evergaol (what in the world is an evergaol, btw?), and all they did was rename him to ""Godefroy the Grafted"". Again, the map is so big, yet feels so small because you're never going to be exploring every corner of it when it becomes a chore just to wade through piles and piles of enemies just for some item you don't even want, or better yet nothing at all.
The story is basically the same as Dark Souls as well, except replace a few keywords and the Dark Soul with the Elden Ring, make it more obtuse and you're good. Rune Arcs are literally just reskinned Humanity or Embers, except they come in a bunch of flavors (you're only going to be using Godrick's and Morgott's most likely, and Mohg's for invasions, since most of them are really gimmicky or underwhelming in comparison). Even the Graces are just Bonfires, but look even worse because it's just a particle effect suspended in the air. I felt next to nothing fighting any of these bosses except Godfrey and Mohg, because most of these fights are just a bunch of nonsense about this great and mighty warrior or sorcerer or evil person - all of which is very shallow - and then you get to the boss, and you beat them. It's hard to say the same for Radahn though, since I was a bit too overleveled before fighting him, and he did have some cool attacks.. You don't feel like they are a character or anything, all you see is a slab of meat, a strong enemy that you have to kill, you barely ever get attached to any of them because by the time you see them they're dead faster than Millicent. The only bosses that don't instantly disappear forever when you beat them are Renalla, Morgott and Godrick, with Renalla just becoming an emotionless stat changer, and the last 2 just turn into shriveled corpses that say some dramatic nonsense before dying, not even with a flashy animation or anything, just falling over. If you want to make a good fight, a memorable one, there needs to be buildup, you need to get to know who you are fighting strong and well and grow intimate with them from afar before you face them down. It's also obnoxious that we somehow kill everyone except Renalla through the death animation, when it would have been a lot better if we were still able to converse with them after they were defeated, just something at all to grow more close with these characters, something to give them a mind and spirit into their stone carcass frozen colder than Medusa's glare.

This game has the same highs as Dark Souls, and more lows. The most satisfaction you will get from playing is a dopamine rush after beating a tough enemy, or getting an overpowered item. Not much else warrants any interest, much less a feeling of achievement. The most fun, however, you will ever have playing this game, is multiplayer, whether it be reading the hundred-thousand variations of ""try finger, but hole"", genuinely funny or useful messages, helping others or striking them from the face of the earth, it's the only thing that makes the world feel not totally monotonous and lifeless. My favorite has to be ""Try aristocrat"" with the laying down emote ontop of the guillotine in the Subterranean Inquisition Chambers..",1659148540,1707252517,False,103,29,0.561337947845458984,23,True,False,False

This is the 2nd most overrated game I have ever had the displeasure of launching on my computer.

[h3] Credibility [/h3]
this is just a small section to show why you can trust my first impressions as opposed to other people.
I don't care whether you believe any or all of the things listed here.
Firstly, I love challenge whether its simply playing a game on its hardest difficulty or doing challenges where im severely limited.
For example, One of my favorite things to do in Destiny 2 are Solo RAID challenges, obviously not everyone will understand the difficulty of these but just know that there are hundreds of thousands of players on destiny and thousands attempt some of the challenges I have done and only a few hundred complete them. they are unintended by the developers as they didn't even expect these things to be possible.
 I also have a deep passion for single player games especially open worlds.

[h2] First impressions[/h2]

I want to make it very clear that I was going into this game knowing that without a doubt controller was the intended way to play.
So upon opening the game, the first thing I did like I do in every game is go to the settings to attempt to ensure I would most likely not need to return to the menu at any point when playing, obviously its basically impossible in any game to achieve settings where I will feel comfortable on the first go. But before even making it to the settings menu I immediately realized that I was experiencing fps drops and general low fps just on the main menu. I didnt worry about it and proceeded to the settings. A lot of the default options are very questionable and im not even talking about the controls yet. There are several camera options enabled by default that are rightfully considered accessibility options in other games. This isn't that big of a deal for someone like me that changes settings right away but not everyone goes through everything like I do and small things like this eventually will end up adding up so an uncomfortable experience. After finishing most of my settings I went to the controls. Now even if controller is the main input device there is no reason for the MnK control scheme to be this out of touch with modern times. F to jump? But its not only this I quickly realized that the UI was not going to be good once I saw the way some of the things were set up. I was already getting the sense that there was this outdated feel to the game. But Anyway I finished that up and decided to start playing.

[h2] Gameplay [/h2]

Oh boy... time to make some people mad

I was pretty sure that I was going to have a problem with the combat before buying as by simply looking at gameplay the combat looked like it feels in game, slow, clunky, and boring. There are several weird game design choices right off the bat and I will not only list them but I will explain why I think they negatively impact the experience. Dodging gives no burst of speed completely removing the point of the name dodge it is simply god mode for a few hundred milliseconds on keypress with an animation and that's how the game makes you use it as well. This part may be incorrect due to insufficient playtime however blocking seemed fairly useless as on normal enemies every attack basically staggers them so you just spam left click and then on bosses dodging is all that is necessary. Now to talk about the actual combat. Hitting or killing enemies is not satisfying at all which is pretty crazy considering that's all you will be doing the entire game. To elaborate slightly, the animations aren't special, not enough satisfying feedback when hitting enemies, and a lot of issues with the movement which I will listed above. Things are made intentionally to make the game ""harder"" such as making literally every enemy in the game basically go slow motion right before you think they are about to attack. As someone who is usually above average this takes only one hit to get used to however it is just one of the many pointless things that are meant to make the game difficult but just end up creating annoying gameplay. I know most people will be unable to comprehend the fact that annoying gameplay and difficulty are two different things but that's not my problem. Some more annoying things include that basically all of your inputs are dropped anytime anything happens. For example, when attacking you cant roll or do anything, after blocking there is this weird cooldown if you let go of block and try to do it again. There are several times during boss fights where you feel frozen. The solution to any actual difficulties with the combat are all solved with one word... Wait. Does waiting sound fun to you? well it wasn't for me when fighting a boss I found myself just staring at them half the time it just bored tf out of me mixed with everything else. Everything in this game just wants you to be slow.

[h2] Performance/Graphics [/h2]

I didn't see much praise over the visuals for this game, which is a good thing since its not too particularly special. It doesn't look bad but it doesn't look amazing. It has an art style and sticks to it which is great. But sadly I have some issues with the performance. One thing you notice immediately is that your fps is locked to 60 which is annoying. Just a dumb limitation most likely required as a result of poor game design. Every time there is any UI elements present there are fps drops which isn't unplayable but is just unacceptable for a game of this praise.
In case anyone wants to know my specs and want to blame it on that here they are.
CPU: Intel i7 12700k
GPU: 7900 XTX
RAM: 32 GB 3600mhz CL16

[h2] Plot/Story [/h2]

I will not go into detail in this category as I am not qualified to do so however there are some things worth mentioning.
The basic premise in interesting enough to warrant giving the game a try however there is nothing more than that. I believe that the two most important parts of a game are its gameplay and story. Only one of them needs to be really good. But sadly there is nothing about the story that was able to hook me from the time I played which can be fine for some games. Another thing that felt dated were the cut scenes, the game would have been better off just not having them as the camera work made me feel like I was playing a game from 15 years ago. Funny enough I wasn't even expecting cut scenes anyway.

[h1] Conclusions [/h1]

The most important thing I want people who havent tried this game to take from this is if you have a feeling you wont like it, do not try it. As I touched on it in the story part above, I believe there is a balance between gameplay and story that needs to be met for example if the gameplay is a 2/10 the story needs to be an 8/10 or they both need to be 5 or something you get the point. But in this game its more of a 3 for gameplay and 5 for story. Sometimes the games appearance can make up for a little bit but as I mentioned above there isnt anything special about the way this game looks. Basically, this game is a clunky and boring mess that feels like it released a long time ago.",1707223501,1707232167,False,3,1,0.377489060163497925,3,True,False,False

there is not a single boss i actually enjoy fighting in this game besides Godfrey 

because its open world i found it significantly more confusing than any other souls game i've played
(and not in a fun way like exploring DS1's interconnected world)

the area scaling is pretty weird and led to me getting railed because i would wander into an area i wasn't supposed to be in because of how lost i was half the time

but after replaying it a few times, the sheer scale of the game along with the incredible lore and design that from soft is known for has won me over.

however, Godskin Duo is still the WORST gank boss that from soft has ever made and i will stand by that even after now finishing DS2 as well.

When you have a game this difficult giving the player so much liberty can be a bad thing sometimes, as lame as it sounds you need a linear path for these kinds of games so the player isn't left questioning themselves if the loot that they found is acceptable for the current boss.

- Nice lore

- Outstanding flexibility in build variety (weapons & scaling, spells, weapon arts)

- Atmosphere lacks loneliness and despair.

FromSoftware’s latest masterpiece, Elden Ring, is nothing short of awe-inspiring. In my 87-hour adventure, I traversed a world that left me breathless, battered, and utterly enchanted.

🔥 Challenges and Triumphs: The game put me through an emotional wringer – from frustration during brutal boss battles to exhilaration when I finally conquered them. Losing mountains of experience points along the way only fueled my determination. Elden Ring’s enemies are harrowing, but overcoming them feels like a true achievement.

🌄 Breathtaking Vistas: The vistas in Elden Ring are jaw-dropping. Whether it’s a sun-kissed valley or a moonlit castle, each scene feels meticulously crafted. FromSoftware takes the open-world concept pioneered by The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and elevates it to new heights.

🌍 An Enormous World: The sheer scope of Elden Ring’s world is mind-boggling. As a “Tarnished” blessed by grace, I explored The Lands Between, uncovering secrets, lore, and hidden stories. The organic side quests kept me enthralled, and the absence of map markers made exploration feel genuinely rewarding.

🗡️ Dark Souls Meets Freedom: FromSoftware seamlessly blends a full-on Dark Souls experience into this vast open world. The combat is refined, accessible, and satisfying. Elden Ring respects your curiosity, rewarding it with intriguing encounters, valuable loot, and unexpected surprises.

📜 A Tale Unfolds: The grand story isn’t spoon-fed; it’s something you piece together as you go. Characters with their own agendas cross your path, and their fates intertwine with yours. George R.R. Martin’s influence adds depth, leaving room for community lore videos to supplement the experience.

🎮 Conclusion: Elden Ring isn’t just a game; it’s an odyssey. It’s the kind of adventure that lingers in your thoughts long after you’ve put down the controller. If you’re seeking a world where freedom, exploration, and challenge collide, put a ring on it – Elden Ring, that is. 🌟

At no point in this game are you forced to beat a boss to progress. You can just go somewhere else! It's great!

February 2024 Edit:

I have all achievements, have beaten the game multiple times with drastically different builds, and itch to replay it again every few months. Absolutely phenomenal game, cannot wait for the DLC

I love this game. It is build on the mechanics from previous Fromsoft titles (mainly DS3) and made bigger thanks to reusing some assets (which is a good thing as it is done right). The amount of moves you can pull off is crazy. The jumping feels nice, the world is beautiful and the minimalistic HUD really helps with that.

The combat is as we remember from DS games with addition of jump, counter attack and crouching. 

World is something else, the scenery looks gorgeous and has so much detail that it is easy to forget that the engine the game is running on is not exactly newest (in fact it is the same engine DS3 used).

Weapons are abundant, often very customizable via Ashes of War. The only issue is that it takes a while until you start getting all the pretty weapons and armours as there aren't many at the beginning of the game (read 10ish hours)

While in the previous games I often kept rushing from one boss to another, here I do the exact opposite, I rather explore. Maybe it is because the Bosses in this game are very chatoic, maybe I am not used to them yet, the endgame ones wipe the floor with me every time.

There are 2 things I am not that happy about in Elden ring. The first one being minibosses that are essentially just big regular foes, which is fine with certain enemies and it makes sense, but then there are some fights when they just throw 2 at you at once and call it a day. Fighting more than one strong foe is pure chaos and usually not the good kind. The other thing is the amount of roll cathing attacks in this game. Literally every enemy has some sort of charge attack that looks like it's coming at you, only to stop for fractions of second or longer resulting in completely throwing of your pace. You are not the one that decides the pace of the fight. The enemies are.

All in all I cannot else but recommend this game, My first playthrough took slightly over 90 hours and I thuroughly enjoyed nearly all the things the game threw at me.",1645813390,1707131378,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

This game succeeds in all areas and is one of the most fun and enjoyable experiences I have ever had. The story, combat, replay ability and exploration are all immaculately crafted to make the perfect video game. I have put a decent amount of time into this game and have beaten it 5 times now and have barely had any moments in which I have not enjoyed my time playing. I could not recommend Elden Ring more to anyone looking for an amazing single player experience and a beautiful story filled game written by George RR. Martin himself.

(Spoilers Ahead)

Now, despite being the most awarded game in history and by far my favorite game of all time, it is not without it's flaws. First off is the multiplayer, now the multiplayer isn't too bad but it could have been done so much better, I think simply having the multiplayer be more traditional would have made the game so much better and more fun with friends. having to download a mod to skip over the bullshit is kind of annoying and having to use consumable items just to play with friends for only a limited time is just obnoxious. Build strength is another issue with the game, now considering how many possible builds there are in Elden ring it would be nearly impossible to make each one completely balanced, but some are just flat out better than others. For example on my first play through I ended up using an Intelligence based great sword and it was overpowered as fuck, i was 5 shoting bosses like Radahn in new game plus. Then I started a new play through focusing mainly on arcane and I couldn't help but notice how much less powerful the weapons were than for intelligence. This is a common issue throughout game being that there are just a lot of cases where 1 weapon or stat is just less good than another one that is available at the same point in the game.

Now all that negativity aside, This game is still amazing and will always be a joy to play no matter what. This game just does so many things right. Bosses are a great example of this, nearly every main boss has an amazing fight as well as good music, lore, and scenery. Whether it be The extremely slow Godrick or the unforgiving Malenia, This game will nearly always provide you with a good experience in terms of boss fights. Speaking of Music and Lore, this game performs incredibly on both of them. In terms of music, it tends to match the environment and or the enemy you are facing. For example, when you reach Leyndel Royal Capital, the music is somber, sad, almost as if the depressing string ensemble is remembering a better past. the lore is similar with it's approach to tone. the game takes place after the golden age and after the great war known as the shattering. everyone has long lost their pride, soul, and will to live and the world is but an empty husk of what it once was.

(End of Spoilers)

Overall this game is a must have to anyone who is looking for an amazing single player experience to sink many hours into. Go buy this game or I will make you fight Melania at level 1 with just your fists until you win.",1706067310,1707091695,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am a completionist though and always find myself wanting to get the game over with as I near the end. I believe this is from fatigue of searching every corner of every inch of the map looking for hidden items or bosses, to which there are a ton of. The dungeons you can find all over the map are usually similar in nature though after you have seen the few gimmicks they have to diversify the dungeons. Once you get to the later zones the dungeons are just repetitions of all the earlier ones, the bosses end up just becoming duo boss fights with enemies we have already seen and glad we are past them. Exploring loses incentive as there are just so many items in the game. You wouldn't even use 70% of them in a normal play through of the game.
The main boss fights are generally really fun, and the combat is just as good as any other Dark Souls game. All in all, this game has so much to offer it is truly a blessing and a curse.

I ""played"" this game for some time more...my opinion did not change on bit.
My game of Factorio has about 2k of h recorded- but I let it play in a background for at least 95% of that time and I did not think I would idle any other game. I left this game idling for 90% of the time because it is just boring.  I run around like a headless chicken, dying like an idiot to any random enemy, since most of them are way too strong for me JUST to come to realize that I CAN kill the dudes that DO LOOK like they are million levels beyond me.
what a joke of a game, and to think I paid 60 euros for  it... what a shame.


Lets do this:
First of all this game do not have any rules.
Like at all.
Game shows me that while I hit the enemy they are not able to move.
then they throw another enemy that attacks me like I do not exist.
Bosses are special troops... they act just like these other weak enemies( no care in the world for me attacking them) but they one hit kill me.

No loot.
No story.
No pointers for what to do.

I am now 1,5h in and I am considering returning this game because it is completely empty in terms of things to do.
ah yeah- respawning enemies.
and I do not mean like after I die- but wait on one place for 5 minutes and all enemies just come back.

AND SECOND THING- so many many messages from god knows who. First I was thinking it is by developers or such, but no- they are such rubbish of text I can not believe a dev would put it in.
But still- here they are.


Overhyped and underdelivered.

Also, I bought this first and foremost for it being open world and having great visuals.

No it is not open world and yes it has good visuals, but constant nagging from enemies that cheat is a huge no no in my book.

Also, there is no quests. Like not a single one.
It is all about going arround and finding( by chance) enemies you can kill to level up so that you can kill those guys you got one hit by. Just so that they respawn immediately like nothing happened.

I have no idea why is this so popular.",1705853024,1707060286,False,1,0,0.307765752077102661,0,True,False,False

There are some memorable moments but most of the time is just spent reloading and running back to the place of death. It is a big game with plenty of mechanics but the width doesn't really justify how shallow certain things feel. Some deaths and encounters are gimmicky, feeling like the devs are looking to annoy rather than to impress. Some of the toughest fights are pretty much RNG as I can only hope the boss do not spam certain attacks. You can summon help but it feels like it cheapens the encounter. Towards the finale, I only want to see it to the end, and I stopped enjoying it many bosses ago. Maybe I was playing it wrong, or it was simply not a game that I enjoy.

Elden ring's story is still absolutely amazing and the world is beautiful, its downright inspiring. I've beaten the game twice over and enjoy the world but actually playing it instead of just enjoying the world itself feels almost like a chore with how much they want you to grind for rune and level. previous games multiplayer had level zones players understood like dark souls 3 being around 130 for mid to late game, in elden ring there's no such thing.",1646935902,1707015624,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I want to feel great about this game, but I simply can't.

There is so much great about this game. The World is generally very interesting and I want to explore it. Lots of interesting places to explore and to visit. From this point the game is pretty great. But it is eventually the gameplay that I simply don't like, especially the boss fight.

The game is pretty much about dodging the enemy attacks and trying to get a hit without taking too much damage on your own.

Dodging in this game works with so called invincibility frames. Some moves and animations of your character  put your character for a short period in an invicible state where it doesn't matter if you got hit or not. The state, if you are currently invincible or not is hidden. You just have to know it, and often it doesn't make any sense, like the animation to get on the horse is in an invincible state.

The game as a very big amount of weapons, all with their own attack animations. This is pretty cool. But the game also makes it very hard to actually explore different weapons, because after the early game a weapon is only actually useful if you also upgraded it. But you don't have enough materials to upgrade the weapons you find. So you are pretty much stuck with the first weapon that you first decide to upgrade for the rest of the game. Trying out different weapons really doesn't work in this game. But you find a lot of weapons.

Boss fights are horrible. Pretty much all Bosses in this game are huge and their design is pretty interesting. Sadly fighting them is usually all the time to learn their movement pattern. This wouln't be that bad if not almost all bosses had movement patterns that felt completely random. The jump attack, in the middle of the air them become slow motion, defying the laws of gravity and to mess up your timing to prepare for a dodge/pary. Then they slam the ground so you think you could attack, just to immediately hit with three more attacks that are as powerful as the jump attack, but this time without the need for the jump and much much faster, just to catch you off guard. This feels cheap. This feel bad. I hate it, I don't enjoy it. And it makes me avoid the boss fights in this game as much as possible (but it isn't possible). Winning also doesn't feel good. It feels like I got lucky or something, not like I actually learned something.

The game is knows for being challenging. But then every time I die, the game greets you with a loading time. Then you run back to the boss arena. Just to then die immediately for some random shit. There isn't any challenge in getting to the Boss arena. It is just a boring walk. A good game would just reset the boss arena and let me try again until I beat the boss without loading times. But not elden ring. Each death is confronted with loading times and a boring walk balk to the point of failure.

Then I've tried to play with bow in this game. I've tried to use the crenels that are everywhere in the game world. It doesn't work. The arrows constantly get stuck in mid air. I've tried to shoot with a bow from higher grounds, but for some reason you can't shoot down with a bow when aiming manually. Then I tried to shoot a long distance with a bow, just to realize that the game takes out all damage when shooting a far distance. Using a bow pretty much only works, when you wouln't want to use a bow. Not fun at all.

Fall damage in this game is pretty much the most broken fall damage I've ever seen in a game. Sometimes you can jump high, 100s of meters in the air. Land and there is no fall damage at all. Sometimes you have a smooth landing. Walk a few meters, and then die immediately, because the game noticed too late you you hit the ground too hard? Seriously, this stuff is broken, inconsistent, and really takes the fun out of some exploration in this game.

Where the game  really shines though is scale. This game has a lot to offer, and it just doesn't end. The world is interesting and it always allows to go somewhere else when it is too hard. However reused room assets in side dungeons can be a bit disorienting.

In the past I had problems launching the game. I don't know if it was because of the DRM or not. But it felt like a gamble. I could never be sure if the game would lanuch or not. Recently though I did not experience this problem.

Last but not least, when I connect the Dualshock 3 controller via bluetooth, the game runs on 5-10 FPS. If the controller is connected through a wired connection, I have a smooth 60 FPS. I have no idea what the problem is. It took me an eternity to even figure out that bluetooth connection was the reason that sometimes the game just played in extremely low FPS, and sometimes it was very smooth.

Overall, I am very frustrated with this game, even though I certainly had very good moments in this game. Just traveling the world in this game and finding all the loot and doing the side quests is generally a very very good experience in this game.",1660058096,1706998674,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is indeed a challenging game.  One that, in the beginning, may make you want to rage quit.  I know I did.  I took a long break from it and then returned.  The game is not perfect.  I am not a big fan of some of the NPC quests.  The reason is they are so esoteric.  You start a quest but then have no idea where to go to continue the quest.  It is almost simply pure luck that you find the NPC to continue its quest.  I do not like leaving my chances up to serendipity.  Additionally, just following the regular questline using the sites of grace as your guide, you will arrive at mini-bosses and bosses that are too overpowered for your character.  You then have to backtrack grinding for runes.  I am not a big fan of that either although it did allow me to hone my combat skills more.  

With that out of the way, let's return to the challenge.  I played this game the only way I know how:  with a keyboard and mouse.  This game, I feel, was more meant for a controller, so to cut down on the challenge, you need to rebind the keys to something more natural for you.  This will help your encounters immensely, at least it did for me.  Next, this is not a FPS.  If you cut your teeth on mostly FPS games, this RPG will murder you.  Luckily, I had played The Witcher before so I had an idea of how to approach battles.  You cannot spam the ""hit"" button. You have to find out what the weakness is of your foe and play to that weakness.  You also must learn to dodge well.  I didn't deflect or block much because I rarely used a shield, but even then, you need to learn to dodge well.  Even understanding this, when I met my first real boss in the game, a shardbearer, I really hated the devs.  I thought they all must be sadistic types who love screwing the players of the game.  (Yeah, I know, irrational thought.)  This boss seems unbeatable, but after probably 10-15 deaths, I finally hit on its weakness.  After that the boss was actually quite easy.  I am simplifying things, but more or less, this is how to approach every boss.  Individual characters will have their stock moves that you will quickly learn and recognize.  Learn their moves well, and you will have less problems.  

Notice I said, less problems.  I had to realize that dying is part of the game.  So if you die, except for losing runes, it is not that bad of an experience.  It resets the area and you try again.  You usually return to the last site of grace where you were.  The only time dying is really a hassle is when, for me, the game places sites of grace too far apart.  In cases like these, you do grind through the area and then die close to the end of the area and since there was no site of grace, you return to the beginning of said area.  In those times, dying is quite bothersome and takes the wind out of your sails so to speak. 

Pay attention to armor and your build.  When fighting certain mini-bosses and bosses, they attack using a certain type of damage, fire, sorcery, holy, lightning and so on.  Depending on your armor and your stamina, you may be able to put on armor that negates to some percentage the damage given.  In regards to your build, don't do what I did.  I was spreading my runes across all of the attributes at first, but really you need to decide on what sort of character you want: an all strength build or perhaps an all magic build.  There are other builds as well.  I ended up concentrating my build on strength, intelligence and holy attributes.  I personally found that incantations are more powerful and useful than most of the sorcery spells so I sunk a lot of runes into holy which really makes the incantations more powerful.  I also put many runes into vigor and mind, your HP and FP (for spells and skills.)  

Now I am on my second playthrough.  It's not as exciting as before, but every once in a while I find something that I didn't notice on the first playthrough.  The game is absolutely massive.  I am so looking forward to the DLC.  If you are looking for a satisfying challenge, give Elden Ring a shot.  It will be well worth it.

Title: ""Elden Ring: A Disappointing Journey into Frustration""

Rating: 2/10

Elden Ring, the highly anticipated collaboration between Hidetaka Miyazaki and George R. R. Martin, falls far short of the expectations set by its creators. What could have been a groundbreaking masterpiece turns out to be a frustrating and tedious experience that left me questioning the hype surrounding it.

First and foremost, the difficulty level of Elden Ring borders on the absurd. While challenging gameplay can be rewarding, Elden Ring takes it to an extreme, leaving players with a sense of constant dread and little room for enjoyment. The unforgiving combat system punishes even the slightest mistakes, making progression feel more like a chore than an adventure.

The open-world design, touted as one of the game's strengths, quickly reveals itself as a double-edged sword. The vast landscapes are indeed impressive, but they are marred by repetitive environments and a lack of meaningful content. The open-world structure seems more like an excuse for the developers to fill the game with empty space rather than delivering a truly immersive and engaging experience.

Adding insult to injury, the narrative, supposedly enriched by George R. R. Martin's involvement, fails to captivate. The lore is convoluted and confusing, leaving players detached from the characters and the overarching story. The promise of a deep and intricate world-building falls flat as the game struggles to deliver a compelling narrative to match its grandiose setting.

Furthermore, the technical issues present in Elden Ring are hard to overlook. Frame rate drops, glitches, and long loading times hinder the overall experience, breaking immersion at crucial moments. It's disappointing to see such fundamental problems in a game that was expected to set new standards in the industry.

In conclusion, Elden Ring may find a niche among hardcore fans of the Soulsborne genre, but for the average gamer seeking a balanced and enjoyable experience, it falls short. The excessive difficulty, lackluster world-building, and technical shortcomings make Elden Ring a regrettable addition to the gaming landscape.",1706985857,1706985857,False,3,2,0.431397050619125366,1,True,False,False

 i belive that the story telling is subpar, so is the exploration and combat. Whitch is the most flawed of all. 
mele builds are garbage there is only a few animations for weapons. bosses are ok and their move sets are interesting and chalangeing. the movement and riding is horrible. 

id still buy it at a discount but at full price defenetly not.

They added a bunch of awful platforming to this game, which is always more of a camera angle struggle than anything to do with skill. You just have to jump and reload 100 times until you finally make it through the section. Some of the bosses are ridiculously cheap. People say ""GET GUD"" but you really just have to get lucky. There is no real story to this game, every character you meet speaks in riddles and you basically have to look everything up on the internet because there are no waypoints or any kind of journal to remind you what you are doing.

The difficulty curve is like a sine wave, every encounter makes me feel either underleveled or overleveled. Bosses in the open world without proper arenas get stuck on uneven terrain, clip into things, and frequently hit the player through walls.
Reinforcing weapons is miserable due to upgrade materials being sequential, requiring a lower tier material in order to use a higher one. This worked in the more linear souls game, but is undermined by and undermines the open world design. If you miss/skip an area with a lower tier smithing stone, you can be stuck for dozens of hours without the ability to upgrade anything.
Bosses get recycled frequently, sometimes as basic respawning enemies that get spammed in later sections of the game.
Boss runbacks aren't as bad, but in exchange you must now press buttons in menus for a while to rematch night time bosses.
It's also possible, and not particularly hard, to miss critical items such as the Flask of Wondrous Physic, resulting in what is essentially a handicapped run.

The invasion experience is somehow even more miserable, but at least you don't have to grind it for achievements anymore.

Boss design is a step backward from Dark Souls 3

Produced using Source Filmmaker, the series follows a fictional war between human-headed toilets and humanoid characters with electronic devices for heads. Since the first short was posted in February 2023, Skibidi Toilet has become viral as an internet meme across various social media platforms, particularly among Generation Alpha. Critics saw the series as Generation Alpha's first foray into internet culture, competing with the older Generation Z. Plot and characteristics
The largely dialogue-free[1] series depicts a conflict between singing human-headed toilets—the titular ""Skibidi Toilets""—and humanoids with CCTV cameras, speakers, and televisions in place of their heads. In a New York City-esque setting, the Skibidi Toilets, and their leader G-Man, threaten humanity. Two types of humanoids, cameramen and speakermen, form an alliance against the toilets. Each has one of its kind that is much larger than the rest, termed ""titans"". A toilet parasite infects the Speaker Titan, leading to casualties. Later in the series, TV-headed humanoids and their titan are introduced, and with their help, the speaker titan is broken free from mind control. The battle spreads to other cities, where the titans destroy what seems to be the G-Man, but is later revealed to be an impostor. The titans convene and seems to defeat the mastermind, the Scientist Toilet, but once again are fooled by a decoy. The true Scientist Toilet is revealed to be in hiding.

Business Insider described the series as ""an endless arms race as both the toilets and their foes [produce] stronger fighters"".[2] A mashup of the songs ""Give It to Me"" by Timbaland[3] and ""Dom Dom Yes Yes"" by Biser King,[4] created by TikTok user @doombreaker03,[5] appears in each episode as the theme of the Skibidi Toilets, and is the origin of the name Skibidi.[3] ""Everybody Wants to Rule the World"" by Tears for Fears is featured in some videos as the theme of the camera-head resistance.[2]

The show contains references to video games, such as the character G-Man, whose name comes from the Half-Life video game series, and the dances performed by the Cameramen are inspired by emotes from the online game Fortnite.[3]

EDIT: So I've completed the game after adding an additional 67 hours. My recommendation hasn't changed however I felt I should ad some comments.
It is a GOOD game. I enjoyed the challenge and felt accomplished when I overcame a difficult boss, however I cannot recommend it. The people who enjoy this type of game already know about it and will already know if they will enjoy it. I would never recommend it to someone who is not already a fan of this genre. I have never played a Souls game and this was my introduction. However I will not play further Fromsoftware games as I am an adult gamer and simply do not have the time to spend attempting the same challenges over and over. I enjoy games for their story and their game play experience, and this game has both, however as my original comment states it did not respect my time and that's a problem for myself, and many adult gamers who do not have a lot of chances to play games. It's a good game by all standards, it ran decently on my PC, it has a compelling story, and the gameplay is unique, however unless you know what you're getting into don't bother.",1705979944,1706922791,False,3,1,0.476028859615325928,0,True,False,False

Lots of possible builds along with flashy movesets for weapons and magic. Really interesting story with multiple endings based on your progression throughout the whole game.

First playthrough took me 100 hours to complete, going through most optional areas (not 100%). Lots of optional content, keep in mind that there are quite a bit of reused bosses and enemies (some are reskins, some are direct copies). I do not believe this game is as replayable as the others in the series due to how massive the game is. The best part of this game is how it naturally nudges you to explore, without revealing too much. There cool twists and bizzare creatures that must be slain!

The size and scope of this game means that Fromsoft has had to design around a fuck-ton of playstyles. Because of this, no one system is ever fully realized to its full potential.

(That being said, a runtime of 25 hours is almost a full-damn game in itself. And you can easily expect putting in 3-4 times that amount. So, buckle in.)

What this translates to in terms of gameplay, is that the most effective way of beating most bosses is to roll spam, wait for a specific, easily-punishable attack, get a chunk of damage in, rinse and repeat. There's no interesting back-and-forth like Sekiro. There can't be. 

Later in the game, you get punished for playing risky. You can power up your character so much but the bosses do as well. Getting swiped by one move may mean 90% of your health-bar gone because you get stagger-locked into a combo. You aren't forced to take chances at all. And the chances are, if you're able to get greedy and finesse a posture break or parry, you could've beaten the boss without it anyway. 

In the same vein, differening play-styles do have their strengths and weaknesses, but committing to mastering one play-style is actively hamstringing your ability to succeed. You're given a repertoire of tools in this game, and some of them are just frankly busted. This plays to a power fantasy, but it also means that the game isn't really designed around you necessarily ""gitting gud"", much to the dismay of souls elitists everywhere.

Really that's the crux of the issue of this game. There's underlying good, fun systems here, but the game never makes you take full advantage of them. The path of least resistance is a little lame sometimes, but intentionally gimping yourself because the balance is so off-kilter is its own problem. It tries to be too much all at once, and fails to recreate something as tight and rewarding as Sekiro. It's a great game to play if you're looking for a really satisfying and beautiful fantasy adventure. Just don't expect Sekiro. Go play Sekiro if you want Sekiro. 

Also, don't do it all in one go (or alone, for that matter)

(Seriously this game is mindbogglingly huge)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

EDIT: As I sit here patiently awaiting the DLC, I have to say: Yeah the balance kinda breaks into a billion pieces at the end-game. Don't go into it expecting perfectly tuned combat. But. As an RPG. It is great. It's just that I tend to look over singleplayer RPGs as they tend not to hold my interest, and the summoning system baked into the game leaves a lot to be desired if you're looking for a Co-Op experience like me. 

However, playing this game with the seamless Co-Op mod has made me re-evaluate my stance and look at it in a different light. I went over some of what I've said and re-worded it to better fit how I feel about the game now. Most of what I said still holds, but I was wanting something out of this game that it never offered. Instead I understood to enjoy it on its own terms. And for that, it is an unforgettable experience that I highly recommend not missing out on.

Martin, emerges as a mesmerizing opus that seamlessly blends haunting storytelling with punishing gameplay. In this open-world action RPG, players are thrust into the fractured realms of the Lands Between, a vast and desolate landscape brimming with secrets, danger, and a palpable sense of foreboding.

From the moment you step foot into this enigmatic world, Elden Ring envelops you in its atmospheric embrace. The dilapidated ruins, towering castles, and mist-laden forests evoke a sense of melancholic beauty, while the haunting soundtrack sets the tone for a journey fraught with peril and discovery.

At the heart of Elden Ring lies its gameplay, a refined iteration of FromSoftware's signature formula. Combat is weighty and deliberate, requiring precise timing and strategic thinking to overcome the game's myriad challenges. Whether engaging in intense boss battles or navigating treacherous dungeons, every encounter feels like a test of skill and resolve.

One of Elden Ring's most striking features is its open-world design, which encourages exploration and rewards curiosity. From hidden caves to forgotten citadels, the Lands Between is teeming with secrets waiting to be unearthed. The freedom to chart your own path lends a sense of agency rarely found in such expansive worlds, allowing players to forge their own narratives amidst the chaos.

Of course, no discussion of Elden Ring would be complete without mentioning its enigmatic lore, a tapestry woven with threads of myth, legend, and existential dread. George R.R. Martin's influence is keenly felt here, as the game's narrative unfolds through cryptic dialogue, environmental storytelling, and lore-rich item descriptions. Piecing together the fragmented history of the Lands Between is a daunting task, but one that proves immensely rewarding for those willing to delve deep into its mysteries.

However, Elden Ring is not without its flaws. Technical issues, including occasional framerate drops and texture pop-in, mar an otherwise immersive experience. Additionally, some may find the game's punishing difficulty off-putting, especially newcomers to the genre.

In conclusion, Elden Ring stands as a towering achievement in the realm of interactive storytelling. With its breathtaking world design, refined gameplay mechanics, and captivating lore, it represents a high watermark for the action RPG genre.

I'm going to start by saying that I have played and beaten many souls and soulslike games. With Demon's Souls for PS3 being my favorite. (I do a full play through about every 3 months.)  What I'm saying is I have experience in souls games.
I played this game entirely in ""Offline Mode"" Which means no invasions, but also no co-op to help fight bosses.

-Gameplay:
The Gameplay is your standard ""souls"" game. Only this time in an open world.
You run around, Explore Catacombs and dungeons, kill enemies (or friends), and collect runes (Elden Ring's version of ""Souls"") to level up your character or spend at merchants to buy items. Like previous souls games if you die the runes in your possession are dropped and you must go to where you died and touch your ""Grace"" to retrieve your lost runes. If you die again before collecting them then you lose them.
Combat is all about Light attacks, Heavy Attacks, and Dodge rolling until either you or the enemies you are fighting die.
In this game there is a mechanic called ""Stance Break"" if you attack enemies until you have dealt enough damage in a small enough window of time you ""Break"" them leaving them open to critical attacks that deal massive damage.
This being a souls game of course bosses are awesome! Wizards, Warriors, Dragons, And Eldritch Horrors beyond mortal comprehension! Every boss fight is so well put together. It feels so good to learn and memorize a bosses move set and eventually defeat them. All of the bosses are challenging but fair. [spoiler] Except Malenia! [/spoiler]
There is a few other gameplay things I could mention but, they are not important to this review.

-Graphics:
This game is gorgeous. They aren't the best graphics ever (Some things are a little smudgy up close) But the art style of this game can't be Topped! From the fields, the catacombs, the ancient capital city, to the snow filled mountaintops of giants. Everything gets you so immersed in the world. And the bosses look awesome! Giant knights in gleaming armor. a sorceress whose battlefield is on a lake Illuminated by a giant moon in the background. Visuals like these coupled with the awesome OST. You will remember every single fight like it was the greatest thing you have ever experienced!

-Sound:
Sound effects in this game are very similar (If not the same) sound effects as other souls games.
Slashes, Clunks, Fire spells Exploding, and even that satisfying *Shing* sound when you kill something. It all feels exactly like a souls game.
The OST on the other hand might be one of my favorites of all time. It has all the classic souls feel of Loud booming war drums and choirs for intense battles with mighty foes. And then there's the somber tracks with a strings orchestra and a single lone echoing voice that brings a heavy air to some of the more atmospheric battles. (Like the aforementioned sorceress fight.) 
And the music that plays in the world is so fitting to every area you will explore.

-Should YOU play this game?:
I can't recommend this game to every one. It is very difficult and demands a lot of time to play. If you don't have experience with soulslike games or you don't play many difficult games be warned this game will be tough. However if you have the patience (and maybe a little skill) then you will play one of the greatest games of the last 20 years.

-Conclusion:
I love this game! I hope that I am able to help you make an informed decision about purchasing this game.

The characters all have some charm to them, though they all seem distant, but that's honestly in line with all Fromsoft games and this universe in particular.

Martin. This game not only extends the boundaries of open-world exploration but also refines the challenging combat mechanics the studio is renowned for. Set in the enchanting yet perilous lands of the Lands Between, it offers an unparalleled adventure that rewards curiosity and perseverance.

Gameplay and Mechanics
At its core, ""Elden Ring"" maintains the signature Soulsborne difficulty, demanding precision, patience, and strategic planning from players. The combat is intricate and rewarding, with a wide array of weapons, spells, and skills that cater to numerous playstyles. Stealth mechanics and the ability to summon spirits for assistance add layers to combat strategies. The introduction of a mount significantly enhances exploration, making the vast world more accessible and enjoyable to traverse.

Story and World Design
The narrative, enriched by George R.R. Martin's lore, unfolds in a cryptic manner typical of FromSoftware's storytelling. The world is dense with lore, hidden paths, and secrets that encourage thorough exploration. Each area, from the haunting catacombs to the majestic castles, is meticulously designed and filled with lore, challenging foes, and intricate puzzles. The open-world design does not merely serve as a backdrop but as an active participant in the player's journey, with dynamic weather and time-of-day systems that affect gameplay and exploration.

Visuals and Audio
Graphically, ""Elden Ring"" is a feast for the eyes, with breathtaking landscapes, detailed character models, and visually stunning spell effects. The art direction effectively captures the beauty and desolation of the Lands Between, supported by a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack that elevates the emotional impact of key moments.

Difficulty
The difficulty in ""Elden Ring"" is a double-edged sword; it's what makes the triumphs so rewarding but can also lead to moments of frustration. The game does not shy away from challenging its players, pushing them to learn and adapt. This steep difficulty curve is balanced with the freedom to explore other areas and tackle challenges in a non-linear fashion, allowing players to seek out new strategies or power up before facing daunting obstacles.

Conclusion
""Elden Ring"" stands as a monumental achievement in the video game industry, offering a deep, engaging, and visually stunning experience that will be remembered for years to come. It successfully balances the unforgiving challenge and rewarding exploration with a rich narrative and immersive world. Whether you're battling nightmarish bosses, uncovering ancient mysteries, or simply admiring the landscapes from atop a cliff, ""Elden Ring"" offers an adventure like no other. It's a testament to FromSoftware's mastery in game design and a beacon for future action RPGs.

-
 
Elden Ring is an Action RPG in the sense that you level up your stats so your chosen stick hits for ever higher numbers. There is some sort of story, too. Choices even matter.
 
You are, once again, thrown into a mysterious, hostile world and set on your path to some resemblance of godhood. You pick your weapons and play style, explore the world and usually die a lot. Assuming a certain familiarity with the genre in general, so far, so soulslike.
 
The gameplay loop of killing enemies, acquiring souls (or runes in this case) as currency or XP and figuring out cryptic quest dialogue just to miss the trigger point anyway stays more or less the same. Combat feels like a good combination of previous systems with some meaningful additions. 
You still have your bonfires (or graces), an invasion/summoning system and grotesquely designed monsters to fight. You will forget attack patterns and dodge too early, veterans will feel right at home.
 
However this time, it's an open world. With what sometimes seems like even less handholding than before. Whereas there were complex labyrinths of gothic brick, now there is a massive, interconnected country to explore. Filled to the brim with hidden NPCs, dungeons and secrets, towering castles and a lush variety of colours and landscapes. That and a plethora of things out to obliterate you. They really got creative this time, to a point. (More on that later.)
 
Exploration in Elden Ring is rewarding. I feel like a lot of the good stuff was superbly hidden off the more obvious path, and sometimes what looks like a short detour might offer up whole new areas of the land. It is entirely possible to pass by major bosses and huge storylines without even knowing about them in the first place.
The game hints you in a vague direction and lets you figure out the rest on your own. It demands you to read it's item descriptions, to actually pay attention to what someone has to say. Otherwise you could miss out on half the game. I like that. It gives away a sense of accomplishment the usual yellow brick path could never manage to deliver. This is my taste, mind, your's may differ.
 
After more than two hundred hours in the Lands Between, I didn't see everything. Yet.
As mentioned, decisions matter, and some will have irreversible and lasting effects on the world and its people. There will be no warning. Consequence will take time. Something to look forward to in the next run, with a different outcome than before. Relevant characters can die and do not respawn. Looking at more recent games, imagine that.
 
Combat builds around the familiar systems of parry, dodge, block and weapon move-sets on your side against learning enemies' attack patterns and finding (waiting for) an opening. With the added verticality of jumping here. You can stagger your opponents, bring them to their knees to land a special attack. Choose between poison or bleeding them out. Burn or literally kill them with lasers. Pick yours, everything is viable. It's on you.

Admittedly, certain weapons are clearly better than others in PVE, but this brings me to my next point: adjustable difficulty. With a new system of NPC companions (additionally to the usual summoned help), special (and swappable) abilities on weapons and the convenience of just going to a different place after hitting a wall, Elden Ring is way more accessible than previous titles. Challenge remains, though. It is a souls game, after all.

Elden Ring is massive in size, with a first play-through easily lasting for 120h and more, and I feel this variety in difficulty gives me as a player more agency on how to progress. Sometimes it just feels good watching your other self massacre everything with ease. Sometimes you just need it smooth.
 
I mentioned flaws, and while I love this game, there are some:
 
Mounted combat more often than not just boils down to two adversaries missing each other repeatedly. While I did enjoy the pythonesque moments the first few times, novelty wore off quickly. If the darn thing disappears because spoilers, well.
 
There is great variety in common enemies and normal bosses alike, however later on some tend to repeat quite a lot. I do not mind clearing the umpteenth 'gargoyle dungeon' or 'zombie cave', but if my reward is the same boss I killed five times over, I might as well just look up if the drops are even worth the effort.
 
Major bosses are very good. That said some feel a bit over-tuned. Not in ways of difficulty (or relentlessness for that matter, as a certain katana wielder may be my favourite in all the souls titles), but in length of their attack patterns. I can acknowledge that my massive lump of steel bolted to an even bigger dragon bone is not the fastest to swing around, but waiting twenty seconds for the boss to decide chaining into another nine hit combo and then fly away is not fun. Besides, if I can wield such brute force, this tiny bow (all my crude hands are able to handle without dexterity) just feels wrong to use as an alternative. So does using something over-tuned (or a shield) myself.
 
Both recycling and questionable bossfights led to slight tedium in the end. To be fair, it may or may not have helped to clear every dungeon during my first run. Your mileage may vary.
 
On a technical level the game runs quite well, with the occasional stutter. Nothing serious, inconvenient comparable to your last stupid death. You know, when you rode straight off a cliff. (1080p, 2060 6GB, R5, 32GB, high preset)
 
After so many games, I still wish there was a better way to consume a lot of different souls (runes). Travelling to a merchant is kind of annoying. Selecting them more so. This is nothing important, but I am still serious. Just let me trade in my fourteen different rune containers at sites of grace. 
 
Lastly, I want to note on your weird horse, Torrent. There is no useless minigame behind him. You don't need to feed him limited carrots for more sprint duration. If you're outdoors and want more reach, just summon him and have at it. He even comes with a double jump, right away.
As traversal is both an important means of immersion, as it is one of simple exploration, Torrent executes perfectly. He is fast and versatile enough to cover good distance in a time that still manages to make you feel the weight of the world around. Most importantly, your strange goat does not get stuck on terrain. (Fall damage is another matter entirely, but see for yourself.)
 
Elden Ring may have it's flaws, but I still regard it as a masterpiece. Exploring the beautiful Lands Between was a joy. I felt rewarded for experimentation and more often than not stumbled upon something entirely unexpected. The story is great, the world and its characters, albeit quite grim, were fun and memorable to experience. I would recommend playing it.
 
Be brave, Tarnished.

Edit: It is now January 2024, I purchased this game in the steam sale with the intent to give it another go. It still runs terribly even on the lowest settings possible with all drivers up to date, and it still freezes and then speeds up to try to catch up for lost frames. I *want* this game to be worth the money I keep trying to give them. But it's just such a terrible port and I just can't justify like 50 bucks CAD ON SALE for these kind of performance issues.

dark souls 2 and elden ring were the only soulsborne games i ever played and i could say the latter offers a more vibrant and massive world to explore with good replayability as expected from the newer release.

things to look out for:
▪experiment with various builds, get beefy af, and still get one/two-shotted
▪takes a sheer amount of luck to look for and/or determine what to do with the npcs in this game and correctly knowing what to do with them is already an achievement by itself
▪fight world boss, roll, lock-on -> locks on to deer/jellyfish -.-
▪no steam game has ever made me want to uninstall until i, using a melee build, fought [spoiler]malenia and maliketh[/spoiler]

despite sounding like inconveniences, the aforementioned are the reasons why i enjoy playing the game as they give a sense of accomplishment beating boss after boss. you can 100 percent the steam achievements in one playthrough by [spoiler]doing almost all possible npc quests (some of which are mutually exclusive), then backing up the save file which you can then just keep on swapping by the time you have to choose your preferred ending after beating the final boss (there are 6 in-game endings but only 3 are required for steam achievements).[/spoiler]

First off, let's talk about the horses. These majestic beasts have the directional skills of a confused GPS. I named mine ""Wrong Way"" because, you guessed it, that's the only way it seems to know. The amount of times I've ended up in a swamp while trying to reach a majestic castle is almost impressive.

The character customization is so in-depth that I spent a solid hour just deciding the perfect nose for my knight. I mean, who cares about slaying dragons when you can have a perfectly sculpted schnoz?

The enemies in Elden Ring are like misunderstood poets – you can't really understand what they're saying, and they're always trying to stab you with a giant sword. But hey, at least they have commitment! They'll chase you across the map like a relentless door-to-door salesman, and I respect that kind of hustle.

The lore in this game is so deep, I almost drowned in it. There are so many cryptic messages and ancient runes that I started to think my character was majoring in medieval philosophy. I'm just here to bash skeletons, not write a dissertation on the meaning of life!

The multiplayer aspect is like a medieval Tinder – summoning phantoms left and right. ""Looking for a sunbro to help me slay a dragon. Must be skilled in jolly cooperation and have a good sense of humor. Serious inquiries only.""

And let's not forget the boss battles – they're like a twisted game of dance, where you're desperately trying to remember the steps while a giant monster is trying to turn you into a medieval pancake. Spoiler alert: I'm not the best dancer.

All in all, Elden Ring is like a spicy stew of chaos, exploration, and questionable fashion choices (looking at you, armor sets). If you're into intense gameplay, breathtaking landscapes, and the occasional existential crisis, Elden Ring is the game for you. Just don't forget your map – or your sense of humor.

fromsoft hasnt had good consistent well designed souls bosses without major caveats since DS3 basegame. they fell into the bullsh*t toxic elitist gamerbro fan 'git gud scrub' hype that was NEVER what made souls games good, and their sh*t has suffered greatly since.

(note that by 'souls game' i specifically am NOT including sekiro. IMO from what ive seen sekiro isnt a souls game in its core design, also ive not played it, so am not going to offer an opinion on its difficulty in this area.)

every time i run into a boss in elden ring that looks like it might be well designed, they add SOMETHING to ruin it completely. 80s arcade 'nintendo hard' bad frustrating unreasonable difficulty that sucks to experience.

if players are getting consistently frustrated at your difficulty, you have failed. it should feel like a challenge to overcome, not like beating your head against a brick wall out of spite, hoping the ai just decides not to use the unblockable undodgable 17-hit AoE combo moves this attempt.

i have played every souls game more times than i can count. i have solo'd every boss. i have played numerous non-fromsoft soulslikes. i KNOW this franchise, i KNOW this genre. im VERY good at it. ER is by far the worst experience i have ever had with a fromsoft-made souls game. it just doesnt come together in the end. the bosses feel like they are tuned for a slightly different game with slightly different controls and player character animation speeds. theres a mismatch, a desync. it feels like it needed two more polishing/tweaking passes.

now that ive finally beaten this stupid f*cking game for the first time, im going to do something ive never done with a souls game: uninstall it and never think of it again. no NG+, no new playthrus with new builds, no npc sidequest runs (talk about bad game design, fromsoft sidequests have always been terrible game design and they dont seem interested in ever fixing that nonsense...) and CERTAINLY no dlc. the only thing that kept me going to the end was looking forward to writing this review knowing i'd beaten it, and freeing up 48 GBs.

also the open world is nothing special. it may be hand crafted, and it certainly LOOKS pretty, but its still mostly empty of things of actual interest. a weapon i dont care about here, a useless ash there, some resources, a really f*ckin sh*tty AoE spamming field boss designed by a 9 year old who pulls the heads off of puppies in his spare time. and the optional dungeons are almost chalice dungeon level bad. with some of the worst designed bosses, too. the ones that arent 'potentially good but ruined by one or two mechanics', but the ones that are categorically sh*t from start to finish.

somewhere along the way during dev on the DS3 DLCs, fromsoft lost something. i noted it at the time but hoped it was an aberration. it wasnt. fromsoft changed. they lost the sense for the TYPE of difficulty that made their games great. now its just masochistic 'git gud' absurd meme bait bullsh*ttery all the way down. i felt it in the DS3 DLCs but it was managable. i felt it even stronger in elden ring, and i think im done. if thats the style fromsoft wants to make going forward, then this is where we part ways. some other dev will surely develop the good soulslikes moving forward.",1706770646,1706771321,False,12,10,0.500401556491851807,0,True,False,False

Pros:
-An absolute masterpiece. Stunning visuals. Stunning audio.
-Most forgiving soulslike game due to mostly excellent grace placement.
-Still challenging and rewarding.
-Atmosphere, has peaceful meadows, complex castles, and areas that feel like a horror game.
-Voice acting is incredible. You can hear the emotion in the voices of NPCs.
-Martyr stakes make jolly cooperation incredibly easy an convenient.
-Weapon upgrade system is very intuitive and flexible.
-Brought back power stanced weapons.
-Kept paired weapons like caestus and claws that don't require upgrading 2 of them separately.
-Guard counters make shields far more useful.
-Simplified magic types allow flexibility without removing their unique feel and features.
-Made the lore and story more accessible to people who don't want to read item descriptions.
-Invasions and hunter phantoms work very well.

Cons:
-Some areas seem to cause terrible framerate regardless of graphics quality settings.

Cons from PVP: (separate for a reason)
-Fromsoft still refuses to implement simple fixes to prevent packmule cheaters. This really isn't a problem once you're level 40+. The main issue with this is that as a new player, I really didn't want to see end game weapons and spells before I've encountered them organically. Spoilers suck and getting killed by them ruins the opportunity to be surprised and terrified of them when you encounter that boss or area.
-No apparent post invasion timer, if you are killed by an invader or kill them you can be invaded again almost immediately. This can make PVP feel more like a nuisance rather than extra excitement that just adds challenge when other PVP related problems are also happening simultaneously. Sometimes there's no break from it, killing or being killed by the invading player should feel exciting. Instead it feels like some form of chore or outright pest control.
-No invasion time limit. If you cant kill the host in 30 minutes you're time should be up. Instead, invaders can run off into the distance for over an hour, waiting for the NPC enemies to kill you or just wasting your time. There doesn't seem to be a time limit. This makes going to other areas impossible without jumping of a cliff or disconnecting. The previous souls games had small enough areas that it didn't matter, you could clear the enemies and make it to the boss room or corner the invader if they chose to be passive.
-PVP compass. I absolutely understand why locating the host player in an open world is vital. However, given the previous issue described, it doesn't really make sense to have the host appear on the compass for the invader only. Being unable to locate an invader who has run off into the distance makes eliminating them nearly impossible.

-This one is much less of an issue but it still seems like a poor choice in game design. You can be invaded after starting a boss fight. I understand that open world bosses shouldn't function like a fog gate and cause an invasion to end, that would make invasions pointless since the host could simply trigger a fight and then run until the boss loses aggro. That being said if you've already started a boss fight it seems a little ridiculous to have someone come and gank you when the boss is 3 hits from death. Given the ease of retrieving runes this isn't really a big deal. It is a Fromsoft game, it's supposed to be difficult and punishing.

Overall still a solid 11/10 game. Developers not anticipating how features will be used or abused in multiplayer is nothing new and most of the issues seem to be limited to low level encounters. My experience is that after Stormveil castle and above level 40 most players seem to be happy to just fight you rather than attempting some drawn out time wasting strategy.",1706769037,1706769037,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
