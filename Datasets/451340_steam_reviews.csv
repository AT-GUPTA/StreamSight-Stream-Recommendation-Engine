I suggest to play this game in costum settings.
Take your first few nuggets othervise you will shovel like a maniac for multiple hours to get enough money to actually start the game loop in a satisfying way. 
Then play without nuggets and on 12x speed, and switch malfunctions and pressure system on, if you like to handle clunky mashines keep easy washplant placing off. i would recommend to switch it on. its a pain in the ass, main reason because mashines are not well on mnk. 

Big Cons:
No multi-player
No AI-Workers
Bad Physics
Bad performance (sometimes)
Not much freedom to do do things in your way.
Low variaty in mashines
No costumazations (there are a few but just ugly)

Overall: I love simulations and this one is nice because of the setting, but not because of its mechanics.

Setting: 10/10
Game Loop: 6/10
Progression: 2/10

Its dig a hole to dig bigger hole.

The developers recently said a lot of people asking for multiplayer but they won't be adding multiplayer,

I Think it's more so they can't add multiplayer IMO! 
I personally don't think they have the code nor the ability to add multiplayer or even Modding support.

Seems like a lot of updates recently but nothing major to bring one back to the game.

It wouldn't be too hard to hire a contractor who specializes in multiplayer.

It would just cost money and they would rather funnel it from you, 
Rather than spend it on a good feature that would most likely bring many people who are fans of the show/genre to the game.

The New DLC:
This is guaranteed to be a paid DLC coming from the latest update notes, 
Don't fall for it they have only updated the last few weeks to most likely gain some interaction for the upcoming DLC,
The players want multiplayer and modding support both which would cost development time and resources.
Instead we are getting paid DLC and nothing that the community wants.

The competition: Gold rush now has a competitor not sure how it is playing now, But Gold Hunters the game was created by a solo Developer and has added more features than gold rush ever could.

Fact of the matter is this game is only going to get minimal updates,

Late 2023 - bought it again.
Actually, Nothing has improved on Any point. 
The truck still floats on the road like a soap bubble. Still has Zero weight and is Still like driving/steering a feather in a stiff breeze.
The graphics are an utter mess Still. They Need to move over to a new graphics engine.

But there are so many ""but"", it's even hard for me to track 'em all for this review. I'll cut it short: I've bought this title a couple of years ago, it was 30th of April 2021: it was a mess. Random, oscillating performances, very little else to do but grinding. I remember I've told myself: i'll be back in a while, waiting for it to be polished and implemented with something else to do, some npcs, since there's NONE. 3 years are passed and honestly... there are a couple of work machines more, a couple of skins and some spare parts more, but there are the same performance issues and basically the game looks and feels the same it was back then. WIth both my rigs, settings upped at max, my cpu sits at 35%, my gpu at 40%, and i have from 170 fps to 30, then 60, 90 then again up to 150/170 in a matter of seconds, then goes again. The more you play, the more fps drop, until you are forced to restart the game, losing precious seconds you could've dedicate to... grinding, of course.  
I don't think i have the power to speed the updates up, so buy it if you feel too: the game is fun. And you'll probably do exactly what you'd expect to do buying a game like this.

I've played this game pretty much since it came out.  Its needed lots of work the entire game.  Though I do enjoy playing it, it needs lots of work.  For example:
No Multiplayer feature - This game would rise to the top if it had multiplayer.  Nothing like running 3 machines, the wash plant and having to make constant runs to town all by yourself.  Anybody who knows gold mining, if the the wash plant is not running, you're not making money.
Better Machine Physics - Nothing like getting your 20,000 Lb bulldozer getting stuck on a tiny piece of dirt. Also, they have independent arm control on the blade, making it where you can grade at an angle, where the game makes you move the entire blade or not at all.

All in all The game COULD be good, but right now it's super boring as you can only play by yourself or vs a bunch of others in a leader board that are also by themselves.

I'll play it again IF they ever make it multiplayer.  Until then, I'll play the slightly lesser Gold Hunter that IS multiplayer",1705776974,1705778422,False,1,0,0.465116292238235474,0,True,False,False

Co-Op really need to be in this game like hired more crew to help you not just the passive crew doing nothing and cost u money for them but Crew that help you digging or carrying or simply just drive from point A and B .
Need some way to get more gold from the ground finding nuggets pretty rare and Drilling it not give much either then just testing spot . Maybe Adding some Diamond Drilling and maybe Create some mine where i live in real there about 30 Gold mine in my area worked myself as Diamond Driller  but creating gold mine will be kinda great.
Need fix some visual bug like the Loader have the bucket at wrong place so it not fill completly .

So the devs started working on technical problems and seem to have an interest again in caring about the game. In the test environment I noticed some good improvements with the lag and FPS situation and it made the game far more enjoyable. Still there is lots of work to do. 

*edit #2*
Studio has been reshuffled and they are working on new content. Looking forward to it. So far my advise would be, if you're into the whole gold mining, setting up everything and able to withstand the monotone work. Go for it, for that genre it is probably the only available option at the moment. If you're just curious...watch some gameplay on youtube to see if this rubs you the right way.

After the first content drop I will decide if I change to recommended or not.

*original review*
It has potential, great potential even. But sadly it has been abandoned by the Devs a long time ago. They just push ""Seasons"" out as patches but they are nothing else than just little competitions.

Don't expect any future additions to the game that make it better.

For starters, the deformation of the terrain leaves much to be desired. There are times when you can ""destroy"" dirt you are attempting to run through the washplant, simply by connecting the excavator bucket with the wall of your hole in a certain way. (Side of the bucket below the lip of the hole.) Another way to ""destroy"" terrain is by simply pushing or dumping it on the non-digging area. Your dirt will simply disappear, thus keeping anyone from creating a stockpile area.

Besides the fact that I enjoy the game and I had many hours of fun, there is little to no new content and game mechanics remains a foggy deal!
Also at tier 5 the extracted gold doesn't match the predicted amount after drilling.
The Amazing Quad introduction is a massive flop. Quad goes slower that the car and seems to have no power at all... also the smallest slopes are hard to go through with it.
Additionally... it get stuck somewhere and is IMPOSSIBLE to get it back

It is kinda fun but the performance is HORRIBLE. I am amazed how a game with such bad graphics (the graphics are really not important in such a game - I totally agree to that) has such a bad performance. With my current system (i7 14th gen, RTX3080ti, 32GB DDR5) it should run just fine but i only get around 80 FPS at some locations.

Also the world loading is not as dynamic as it should be. In some points you see how the game is loading the area as it pops up and you have a short freeze.

Driving the car in this game is also a pain in the *** as for example the breaks do not work at all?!

The game has so much potential and has pretty awesome mechanics, still cant play it with this crappy performance.

dont get me wrong, i really love the games concept and the game executes it well, however (again) the lack of meaningful updates over the last few years makes it hard to recommend the game
i dont know how large code horizon is, if its a very small team then i understand it and it would be nice to get some news regarding whats going on behind the scenes sometimes as i cant help but feel like they dont really care all that much when they dont say anything

No Gold Rush 2...

Multiple times Code Horizon devs have made false claims that they are continuing to develop this game. They do these “contests” and “fake season events” as a poor attempt to make it seem like they are active and contributing to advancing the games mechanics and content. Like many state every post, this is a lie and please don’t fall for it. Only very recently after 5+ years have they added anything or done any effort to fix the game. Don't fall for anything CH says as they are notoriously nefarious with their business practices. They will ban anyone that calls them out for it. Any effort by them to progress the game is purely to keep what little sales they still make off the game going.

At it's core it's digging dirt and washing it, more or less just like the show. At times, it feels just like the show. You're desperate for money and you know the one thing you need to do: run pay dirt. But things just keep going wrong. Everything's breaking, or that cleanup was dramatically smaller than it should be. Is there a setup problem or are you just not on the gold?

Unfortunately, like a lot of niche games this ends up being a pretty janky experience. The performance sucks. FPS is fine but driving around the map is met with loading hangups, huge amounts of pop-in for terrain features, and a render distance of about 10 feet for most place-able or drive-able objects. But none of that is unexpected for this something like this, and if you like the core loop can easily be overlooked.

However, the game is not without it's bigger issues, and extremely questionable decisions.

 1. The loan system is totally worthless, and possibly broken. Just looking at the loans should discourage you from ever bothering, but sometimes you are in a tight spot and don't have much of a choice. But here's where I'm confused: Take a $60k at 21% interest at 23:30. At midnight I somehow had a $24k payment due. At 11:00 that same game day I go to pay the loan off for....$102k? Just pretend loans aren't in the game.

2. The vehicles barely work with their terrain system at times. I'm driving a front loader with wheels larger than my real-life car, and it gets constantly stuck on the tiniest patches of deformed terrain. If the terrain is on bedrock there's maybe a 50/50 shot as to whether you can actually get a machine to engage it and remove it. If it's not on bedrock you are just as likely to screw up the terrain beyond all usable condition if you try to fix it.

3. The pressure system is just...yeah. It rains for 12 hours non-stop and then like clockwork at noon your water source dries up because it hits a sweltering...80 F?  It's a system patched in later that tried to encourage the use of high-tier water supply gear...but it's not even half-baked...its just straight raw. The only real effect is to make you effectively only able to play the game during night time. Thankfully it can be toggled off at any time. Just do it from the start, it adds nothing to the game.

4. The upgrade path for equipment is really shallow, with half of it locked behind DLC. With the exception of the excavator there is 1 vehicle to serve each purpose. But we're not gonna count that because the small excavator is completely worthless and should be skipped. I'm not asking from Farming Sim levels of gear, but something more substantial would have been nice.

All that said, I do enjoy the game and will continue playing it. I don't really know why, but I dig. It's a game that offers a limited experience that you can't really get elsewhere, even if it's got problems and some boneheaded design decisions.",1700583884,1700583884,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You can't stockpile paydirt near the washplant... there's a bug or something, where if you dump the dirt with a rocktruck nera the wash plant which is technically just outside of the diggable zone - the dirt just dissappears. So the only way to load the washplant is to take a front loader (which are so clunky to operate), drive down the hill to the paydirt, pick up the dirt on a downhill slope, and the turn around on a slope (this is a pain because vehicles get a pretty heavy movement penalty on hills) and then go up the hill and put it into the wash plant... this is the SILLIEST thing ever... just watch a single episode of Gold Rush, and they dump/stockpile the dirt right by the wash plant...

The premise though still gives you great reward as you can enable very easy mode or whatever mode suits you.
As for tutorials. There is a tutorial in the in-built manual/guide. It tells you exactly what to set up (equipment needed) as you advance through the plots of land. It even shows you how they fit together. 
The vehicles need repair, inc jacking up to remove wheels, engine parts, filters on generators and the ability to shop for parts and sell gold nuggets or get them smelted into gold bars. Everything pretty much in real life is carried out by you in the game. Inc connecting water pipes and electrical connections correctly. Everything runs off generators and consumes fuel which you can go into town and fill up a bowser and Jerry cans. It’s satisfying hitting pay dirt and a nugget. It’s slow and very time consuming, but that is the nature of the game and real life. 
As I said, the engine is the weakest point. It struggles to load areas/textures when you go into to town, but when on site it’s fine, to a degree. There’s a lot of heavy machinery and equipment to buy or rent and a lot to do to keep you occupied. It’s definitely a love/hate game.
Regardless, i cannot recommend it for the main feature of the game -digging. The soil engine is utter garbage. Explosives would be the better option. 
I recommend trying 'Out of Ore' on steam as it has mining (proper deforming soil) as well as diamonds,gold and tons of other minerals with over 30 vehicles and 7 huge 400Km sized maps!",1681921188,1699096717,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Well, with a super powerful PC compared to when this game came out its still got issues, its just not clean, I am unsure how over the years they are on season 20 something and still have this many bugs. Its playable... and its OK... but I don't believe the reviews, this should be well inside mixed or worse.

UPDATE:
Had a run in with some company rep looking after the forums.... shame they spend more times on the forums than actually building the game... if he had had a sence of humor, or actually been willing to get of his high horse, I would have left this review alone. Game was on a wire, not is NOT RECOMMENDED

UPDATE:
I thought after the months since my first reiew and the consistant updates would make this little bit clunky game perfect..... Its really dissapointing how bad this game has got... I now get massive frame drops and crappy load times... its like all the patching has made the game way worse in proformance.... Still a good gameish.....  it really is on a wire of ok, not ok

ORIGINAL:
Interesting game this one.

Firstly I was surprised that this is a true open world, that you are give a truck and a little money and off you go... I was expecting a progressive mission game, I was happily mistaken, and immediatly took my hat of and tip it to the game devs.

Secondly I didnt understand others rage at the devs for the game... Oh it has bugs..... some horendous bugs... but the game it playable, and the devs are ACTIVELY patching the game, and adding to it. this makes me less inclined to bitch, even though this game should be concidered an early access game

Thirdly I got to Tier Three Mining.... really fast... dissapointingly fast (free nuggets turned off). not much to do after this but just make money..

Summery - I think the devs have the start of a really good game here, Its one i am personally interested in..... BUT!!!! It needs work, lots of it.... Its also very boring (I suspect the devs are just trying to get mechanics right first) Haveing shit to spend your hard earned dollars other than equiptment upgrades is what most of these types of games are missing.

Performance on lower end PC's I have noticed it averages 40-30 FPS if Ur lucky but with a change of settings u can sit at 50+ happily. Overall game play is great everything's smooth and fun to play its a very very time consuming came without a co-op or multiplayer game mode/option and that really kills the vibe of the game. Everything gameplay wise is pretty well made and theirs no running out of upgrades or things to do or buy. Youll spend alot of time enjoying the game but i personally cant really play more without kinda feeling deadd in the water as i can only get so far by myself even after just sitting their for a whole day ur money kida gets sucked up because operationg machines by urself takes up alot of time

This game is very addictive. I just started playing it about two weeks ago and have about 120 hours in it, not much considering others play time. 

The biggest improve the DEVS could do would be to add multiplayer. I understand it isn’t being considered due to what it would take to write the code, but the fact is still the same. The game would be better with multiplayer. 

Working on the workers, I think would be a plus as well. I need played the original version of the game when workers found gold for you. I don’t want an NPC playing the game for me or doing all the work, but I do feel the DEVS went from one extreme to the other. I feel a better solution would have been a percent system. Based on how many workers you have, depended on the percent of hold found. If you did have one worker which only worked 48% of the time, then maybe find an extremely low amount of gold. In turn costing you money, due to the contract. If it was one worker at 86% of the time. Maybe he would find find an ounce to a few ounces an hour. And this multiplies based on works but by fragments of percents, not leaps and bounds. Also a HUGE improve for the DEVS would be to see these NPCs.

I also feel the loan system at the bank needs to be redone. The interested set when the loan is taken remains the same, whether you pay it off early or not. The interest should be recalculated if paid off early to avoid interest, just like in real life.

The DEVS  should also consider adding a leasing system to the equipment as well. A lot of new miners can afford to straight up buy new equipment and lease it. Also, adding more options, when it comes to upgrading to larger machinery. I understand they are avoiding licensing fees and not naming them real things but if they have a small dozer like the D9 to the D10 would be a cool stepping stone. 

Also, if you could purchase new or used pick up trucks, I feel it would increase the excitement as well. It would add another element to work at and would distract some players to spend money on something besides the claim. Which would bring them back to the claim to work harder, due to lack of funding. Same goes to living conditions. If you could have various trailers to sleep in and just like the “dirtiness,” you could add the possibility to building various sizes of housing on the claim.

I love the fact that you can lease then own the claims but they should have different size claims. All the claims are all the same size with higher and higher quantities of gold. If you could have various quantities of magnetite on the different claims. That way, if you goal is to upgrade the blacksmith. Maybe you would need to purchase a small claim which is high in magnetite but low or moderate in gold, but was a lot cheaper due to what would come out of the claim.

If you adjust the “dirtiness of the parcel” to various stages and you have to improve it would be very exciting. For example, if you could upgrade the tent to a crummy shack, then to a nice shack with nice wood, to a rough looking out building, to a nice out building, to trailer, to building, and FINALLY, etc...

Lastly, at least for this post is, what in the hell, happened to this town and community? Is this some post apocalyptic town when one man minds gold and pays for mining equipment and machinery to nonexistent people? Why does this environment look like we are in the third stage of poverty? I love the setting and it looks amazing. But I feel like they did all this work and then plopped this “town” on the back drops. I’m not saying to not be proud of what was created but, don’t just do “this” to move to something else. The DEVS have worked so hard to make it to this, which is an amazing product in-progress, but I feel the town is just this thing in limbo. Add a few elements to it. Don’t make it look like garbage is everywhere. The Police Department looks like that is ground zero for the atom bomb for god sake. If your adding the ability to buy new trucks, then make a dealership where you run up to the door, press “e” and a catalog system opens. You don’t have to generate all the playable trucks until the player decides which to purchases the rest of the trucks and cars in the game can, for now anyways, be generic and as they are.

To all reading, thank you for taking the time and please feel free to comment. Agree or disagree, we are all different and I support your views.

 To the fans of this game, let’s continue to provide ideas for improves, so the DEVS see this project is worth working on and making big changes on.

To the DEVS, in NO WAY am I try to “slam” you or “make fun” of what you have worked so hard on. This game and project is amazing and has an extreme amount of potential. This topic of gold mining, may have a pretty small dedicated fan base. But what this game can become would expand it. You’re doing great work and please put out some game improves which would bring back some players, instead of the random bug fixes. A DLC or few would help fund some projects for this game.

For now fans, keep digging and to the DEVS, keep up the great positive work!

UPDATED: 

Original Review was posted with 119.2 hours of game play. I now have 817 hours of game play. It was an amazingly fun game but, since the last review, the game content has NOT changed at all which was almost two years ago. The DEVS were talking about releasing this game on consoles back when I started and the release date for console release is STILL not here and continues to be bumped back every time they give a date.

This game is now poorly optimized. I wouldn't say I have an amazing computer but it is a very good one and it still stutters around when turn or handling things.

I would love to blindly support this game but sadly, the DEVS have given up on this game. They just continue to have ""seasons"" that players make as much gold as they can and they reset. This happens over and over, and over, and over, and over. 

I still recommend this game but it will continue to be the way it is now, forever sadly.",1550691847,1690502748,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You can only see the (very small and underwhelming) gold ingot that you bring down the road from the blacksmith to the bank to sell. For a game about gold, you don't see lots of it.  2- The vehicles you use to dig are painful to operate, and its all you use as soon as you reach the middle game. 3- It's not even nice to look at : usually it never bothers me, but here for some reason its really bad. You start the game during winter with the filthiest snow texture I have ever seen in a video game, and the dirt wich you spend 90% of your time digging and walking on has a terrible texture as well. 4- The gameplay loop gets boring very quickly. You buy new equipment, set it up, put the dirt in the machine, the machine sorts it, you go smelt the ore into bars, sell the bar and repeat.

Without using the nugget option you will spend hours digging and processing gold by hand to break out of the early game. Renting a drill machine as soon as you have $3000 is the way to avoid this as it yields a huge amount of gold (in comparison) in a minimal time but then leaves you to slowly (oh so slowly) convert it into cash.

I keep coming back this game hoping I'm going to enjoy it but despite it having been out for years the devs haven't even bothered to resolve the most basic issues about the game.

Graphics is actually really good even if not playing on highest settings, the game might not run completely smoothly even with really decent hardware, but this is really not that noticeable since a little lower framerate now and then really doesn't cause any staggering or any thing atleast not from what i've experienced.

Now the reason i have chosen not to recommend this game is because it is still really buggy and the movement mechanics really can be wierd and annoying at times, albeit this is mostly when NOT in machinery. One more thing that i think really should atleast just be a consideration by the Devs is the oh so dreaded MP, now the devs have already said that this will not be a thing since it would require too much rewritting of the game and i'm sure there are other reasons too.

All in all i would give this game a 5/10 since it for the most part really does compensate for the cons, and i know this really isn't a in depth review, but hey i'm not a reviewer so this is mostly jsut my opinion.

Con: Would be so much better with a multiplayer/coop feature, but the developers won't rewrite 50% of the code to make it happen.

EDIT: Correct me if I'm wrong, but this is still the best gold digging simulator game out there. Would love to play similar type of games if anyone has any suggestions, please let me know in the comments. Thanks!

EDIT#2: Here's a part of my review of Construction Simulator, which I hated: 

Ok, reinstalled it and played for perhaps 15 minutes before uninstalling it again.
If you're a solo player, I'd recommend taking a look at (Gold Rush) if you haven't already. 
Don't expect frequent updates or multiplayer (I haven't played a game where I wanted multiplayer more, but it won't happen). While there's some snapping for major equipment like trommels, shakers and duplex jigs, and mandatory delivery for bigger vehicles like excavators and the dumper, everything else needs to be physically picked up at the store and transported to the claims/sites. You'll need to connect hoses of different size and decide their path, it's the same with electric cables. Equipment will consist of parts (Springs, cables, wheels, batteries, cogs, tubes, buttons etc etc) that can break down and need switching out. It's not a perfect game, could be better optimized, but there's a lot of content for a fairly low price, it's given me hundreds of hours (300+) of entertainment. Up until Construction Simulator, GH has been (correct me if I'm wrong) the best excavator ""simulator"" out there imo.

So CS might have better ground physics and more excavators to choose from, but the auto-completion of jobs takes away every sense of accomplishment. It basically deletes everything you've done and puts in the creation of the developers, wether it's a hole in the ground, a flat surface, a tree, a wall, cargo pallet placement, etc, etc etc. In GH you have to plan the whole worksite and I think it's really rewarding seeing the claim evolve as you get more equipment on site and the whole place forming into a quarry as you dig deeper and bigger, making it more into your creation instead of the developer's.",1642340412,1685274369,True,6,2,0.554190516471862793,0,True,False,False

They ""updated"" the game forcing me to change the file structure, we got a nice warning.  Yay.

Now i've come back to it, and the ""updated"" files are gone, and unreadable. No endgame wash plant, no full vehicles, no hole to bedrock with a ramp that took 100 hours.

The oldest saves from 2018 are there, missing all the money, extra machinary and not even beginning to get down.
This is apparently a repeat process, changing file strcure and just placing their hands in the air, telling people to start over.

They removed two bypasses allowing you to add gold or cash as 'cheats' which would then flag your file so you couldn't compete. Many of us don't care about the fake leaderboard.   Then they encoded game files so people couldn't just add money to their game to actually use mechanics, see end game; or reality forbid, replace a game state when they changed the files that are now no longer readable.  Again, it still flagged at the leader board so you couldn't ""cheat"" that way and never could since 2018.

How about you put the save files back to un-encrypted so those of us that want to get all of our game-state back, or get to end game and not waste 100hours who don't care about a leaderboard of nothing can do so?

Or at least give us the password for the file so we can do it ourselves, which would then flag so if the people who don't understand can't waste time with false bug reports because they altered other file aspects (the purported reason for locking the game files instead of just asking if people changed them).

I wouldn't  bother with buying it now and wish i could get a reimbursal, it also deleted the custom skins i had, and referencese as well as the files which were never removed from a drive that was put directly into a new tower.

The single biggest issues are optimization, this is a necessity as it just feels slow in general. NPC's? Yeah, nothing there. Hiring workers is cool, but you can't see them, interact with them, or even watch them work so that kinda sucks. The Tutorial is not very good, many steps are missed when ""learning"" the game so be prepared to just figure stuff out at first.

What this game really needs is for workers to be active in the mine assisting in operations so you don't feel so alone, like filling the truck with pay dirt or driving the pay dirt to the plant, something, anything showing actual involvement in the operation. Multiplayer would probably be cool if you like playing that style. And the mine site buildings don't seem to have any doors, so no wonder why they are abandoned... I wonder if people died inside or just never made it in to begin with? We'll never know I suppose.

Some bugs(?) include trailers being detached when fast traveling. Like the back of the truck getting high-centered on the mobile water tank. But you can also jump in the bed of the truck and walk with the brake off and the truck will move progressively which is really weird, so real-world physics are not part of the game. Bulldozing dirt is not very effective as the mechanics of this are strange and clunky. And heavy machinery tends to get high-centered on small lumps of dirt that would normally just squish away which can be a 5 minute journey of up-up-down-down-left-right-left-right-up-down.... you get the idea.

Overall, it is a fun game if you like to grind, and grind, and grind, and grind.... and grind. Everything takes forever, even with fast travel. The mechanics could use some serious polishing, particularly the physics of pretty much everything. And not being able to place the wash plant wherever you want is a bit disappointing. But hey, it's a game and I find it enjoyable for wasting time, so go dig some pay dirt and find some gold.",1682553057,1682553057,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

One of Gold Rush's standout features is its realistic equipment and mechanics. Players must purchase and operate heavy machinery such as excavators, dump trucks, and a car wash to extract gold from the ground. Each machine has its quirks and requires its own specific set of skills to operate effectively.

The game also features a number of realistic challenges and obstacles that players must overcome in order to succeed. For example, players must manage their budget, maintain their equipment, and deal with breakdowns and mechanical failures.

 Another feature I love about Gold Rush is the exploration and discovery aspect of the game. Players must locate areas with high concentrations of gold, which requires careful surveying and prospecting. Once they find a promising location, they need to set up their operations and start mining the precious metal.

 Gold Rush also features a variety of game modes, including Career mode where players start out as a small miner and work their way up to larger farms, and a Sandbox mode that allows for more creativity and experimentation.

 Finally, Gold Rush's graphics and sound design are top-notch, immersing players in the beautiful and rugged Alaskan landscape. The sound effects of the machines and the sound of the river add to the realistic overall experience.

 All in all, Gold Rush: The Game is an extremely engaging and well-designed simulation game that offers a unique look into the exciting and challenging world of gold mining.

Just remember , panning for gold is and always was a hard , lonely and rather boring job for very little reward. If the dev's introduced multiplayer it would make the game far more interesting and less lonely but that doesn't look like happening now after nearly 6 years of waiting.
 For now, the game has all the equipment you need to go much further than just panning , and has some appeal if your interested in hunting for gold on your own , but gets boring -  ultra fast .

Dead game. No content since launch, and minimal effort to support / address game breaking issues (low earth orbit excavators, for example...)

Leaderboards are all they do, and those are poorly communicated and have profoundly shallow content - get a random claim for $0, unspecified bonuses to unspecified ""stats"" (wtf are those in this game?) 

Terrible visual glitches when digging - entire walls and floor textures disappear. 

Dev will never support mods - something vague about the agreement / contract with Discovery...

Game's a cashgrab and the store page is extremely misleading, to the point where the advertised content and support is flat out false.

This is why. 


This game, from the start should've had a multiplayer/co-op. People asked the devs over at Coder Horizon if multiplayer is coming and this is what they had to say. 

""We here at Code Horizon know that the community would love to have Multiplayer as part of the game. Unfortunately, it’s not possible for us to implement without rewriting 50% of the game. Instead, we’re continuously working on other features."" 

Code Horizon doesn't want to rewrite ""50%"" of their code for US. The ones who are supplying money into their pockets. 

What ""other features"" have we seen? 

Nothing. 

We have ONE dlc pack and it's honestly trash and shows their laziness. They add ""Frankenstein"" which is just a conveyor strapped to the top of an excavator. Because trying to move dirt to a dump truck and to the wash plant takes almost 20 minutes. The other addons with in the pack are just 2 trommels and 2 rocker shakers or whatever they are. Don't know. Don't care. 


Also a full dump truck gives you about 30 seconds to refill and dump into the rock-shaker because the wash plant moves very VERY fast. Almost too fast for a single player title. 

If you are going to have the wash plant move that fast and have the map at this scale, we NEED a co-op because the game gets V E R Y boring with just ONE PERSON running around to trying to rush a ""gold mine"". 

How can you get the backing of Discovery and not see that they have almost 20 people running those mines out in Alaska.....But you focus on single player....how f****** sad. 


Code Horizon. Get off your lazy high horse and start working on either getting multiplayer set up for this game or put out a new multiplayer mining game with actual license from CAT, VOLVO and so on.



To you the buyer that is interested in this game. I would honestly wait for ""Gold Hunters"" to be completed and buy that game instead. Even with this game onsale it's just not worth it. Save your money for ""Gold Hunters"". 

The game looks better, will have multiplayer and the devs won't worry about ""Having to rewrite 50% of the games code"" for a better overall player experience.

You go from tier 1 to tier 2 & you lose the ability to find random gold nuggets,  But then when you get to tier 3 with an excavator, you're back to finding nuggets. ?????

The amount of effort you need to put into dumping dirt into the mobile washer is ridiculous, You're constantly trying to dump dirt into this thing but its too tall to get a good angle so you kinda have to bug it a bit. then after about 30min of filling it you get a whopping 100grams of gold. and to upgrade to the next tier you need hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Hiring workers seems to be the most ridiculous of all. You get a random hirable who you can't really confirm his job that much, hire the dude & he can work the pan. cool......but he doesn't do anything. Nor does he even appear. I read online his job is only to replace mats, but mine wasn't even doing that. so i fired him and hired the next guy, who is a mechanic. I am spending 1,600$ per day or so for this guy and i don't even know what HES doing.

I just want to hire more workers to ease my workload. I have no idea why they don't just dump a list of workers and let us upgrade them over time.

Once, all my extra equipment ( purchased as replacements for when equipment broke) all fell right through the storage shelves they had been placed on and ended up underneath the bottom shelf.  I spent about 20 minutes in recovering about 90% of the items. The others couldn't be retrieved.  

On several occasions, I managed to be catapulted into space and then dropped back into an area where I had never been, or the whole screen became a mosaic mess for several seconds.  Another occasion, the equipment stopped working correctly and caused all my hard earned pay dirt to just disappear when it was put into the Magnetite Separator.  The fix for the problem was to log out of the game, log out of Steam, and then restart Steam.

If you read other reviews of the game, you quickly begin to understand that anybody who's played the game quite a bit is pretty dissatisfied how the developers of the game never really made any attempt to fix the glitches that ruin the game.  They continue to put out new seasons DLCs but are unresponsive on social media.  Much as I liked the game, in spite of all the glitches, it eventually becomes tiresome dealing with mechanisms that don't work correctly.",1671215801,1671215801,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I bought the game when I had a 1070 and it ran fine, but once I upgraded to a 3070 the frames just disappeared. From what I can gather the game isn't optimized to run on RTX  cards and there is no fix or patch for this. The only solution I've run across is to turn shadows off and this did fix the issue of frame loss for me. Other than that if you like economy driven games where you spend money to make money faster, this is pretty good. 

There's a lot of nuances in the game I really enjoy, like buying water filters, oil filters, hoses having a certain range to them, etc. Little stuff like that makes it FEEL more real. Because these are things that you would have to buy and deal with in a real world setting. I can see how this would be off putting to some people but it's a lure for me more than anything. 

I never watched a lot of Gold Rush, but this doesn't feel like it relates much to that other than the theme of mining for gold in the Yukon. Seems like the tie in was done more or less just to try and ride on the shows popularity.

I recommend Medievial Dynasty, it has automation so you can maintain a small village with the help of workers. For those who enjoy automation. Also, Truck Simulator also has worker automation who drive your semi's nationwide making you money while you do other things like explore the map and roads to open new garages.

It's Single Player only. There are 100 different tasks for you to do around your mine, and you have to do it all by yourself. You can hire workers, but they don't actually do anything except maybe change out your mats in 1 hog pan. Running all the equipment, washing the gold, everything, you have to do yourself. It's time consuming to say the least, but if you like simple casual games where you do all the work and just enjoy the heavy equipment and digging for gold, then this just might be for you.

The idea of new content coming out sounds great but it has been some time since there has been a major update that impacted the way you dug for gold, each update has been U.I., bug and peace of mind things or just released cosmetic items for the season winners. Don't get me wrong it's great the top preformer's get stuff but it's becoming repeative and lack luster.

Now for the problems I've seen and have experienced, this game is laggy at best and will crash on you more times than you can count if you don't have a mid to high tier computer lets not forget the graphic bugs that happen when dig deep or when you use certain camera angles. Like I said earlier it gets repeative and you spend long hours just digging away, there hasn't been any major updates that were game changing or awe inspiring to make me want to play this game more than I already have, but I conclude with this, this game is not worth the full price, get it on sale or if it's gifted to you sure go for it play it but in the end it's not worth the 20 some dollars their charging now.

 After a long time with this game, I have to change my view. They have added some things here and there but overall the lack of innovation, and the inability to push this title forward has really been disappointing. Still to this day the dirt physics are horrible and all the gold mats/shakers etc still equalize. There is no variance in gold levels in mats. There is still a disconnect with the work you put in versus the end product. You don't even get to see gold until you go to blacksmith. One of the biggest issues is the tremendous failure to make this title multiplayer/Coop. Even to this day they don't want to hear anything about it.

This TV show derived game like most games derived from TV or film is a mess of frame drops and poor design, it can barely run at the bests of times even with a fairly stout machine on low settings due to its frankly unappealing optimisation, the lack of a multiplayer also is a nail in this four year old game as it would smoothen out the clunky, slow, tedious and repetitive dull game that it is. The controls are a mess and are all over the place for default settings and get worse when you add a gamepad into the mix to try and help out the mechanics of the loader and excavator controls but even then I found it confusing and even at times frustrating. Code horizons even though a fairly young developer of games seems to have missed the mark for a simulator or even an arcade style game with this one. And to add I bought this game on launch and to me it seems like the devs have just abandoned it or are just not listening to people that are trying to tell them that it needs something more done to it. 

Overall for this game in my opinion its not worth the money, the poor quality of the game is a bad sign for what is to come of this developer and I hope that this game isn't their downfall and make something to blow all of us away.",1612375965,1665466611,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Yesterday, I decided to risk it, and bought the game.  Today I got a refund.

I'm sort of at a loss as to how the devs pulled off the mess they have managed to make here. Perhaps the best way to start explaining how oddly broken this game is is to point out that I get a steady 120 fps in most of the game - except when I don't, like at the blacksmiths, where I get 6 fps.  Yup, 6 - for no discernible reason.

The graphics, on ultra, are bland and washed out.  The sun is a simple off-white disc in the sky.  Shadows pop in to existence about 10m from the character. There are huge areas of the map you can't walk on, for no good reason.  The game stops dead for several seconds every 100m or so as you move around, to load - again, for no discernible reason.  The default mouse sensitivity suggests that no-one involved in the development or testing of this game has ever heard of a gaming mouse - or any mouse with more than 50 dpi; moving my mouse an inch or two caused me to spin around more than 3 times before I turned the sensitivity *way* down.  I usually turn the sensitivity *up* in games.

I could go on, but I won't.  I'm so sad that this is the 'best' game we have in this niche - and I am sickened that the devs threw away such an opportunity with such clear incompetence.  What a waste.

I know that PlayWay doesn't really care all that much about the quality of the games they produce, as long as the money keeps coming - but if I worked for them I'd be angry about this one.  If I worked for Code Horizon, I'd likely deny it to avoid the embarrassment of being associated with this mess.

If you really really want a gold mining sim, save yourself the pain and just wait until someone makes one - this isn't it.",1664460494,1664460494,False,18,0,0.662664294242858887,0,True,False,False

The game has so much potential but they just wont do anything with the game other then adding seasons and minor hot fixes.

- whats wrong with the game is its unoptimized and runs poorly on even very high end rigs, the mining machines are very under powered i mean the dozer is almost useless and and the other machine are usable but not great. The repair/ break system is both unrealistic and realistic i think its not needed it the game other then for certain items i mean its a mining game not a mechanic simulator.

I love the concept, but this game as it stand worth not more than £5.

UPDATE:

As you can see. Since my initial review, I put in some hours. Yet I failed to acknowledge the effort the Devs did in order to fix the bugs. I think it's needless to say that there are almost no  more crashes. I had 1 or 2 in the last 300 hours. I just want to say: Thank You for this game, it's been my therapist for so long.

Plus
- Very good atmosphere
- The digging, the way you grab soil looks right. Not realistic, but right.
- The existing machines are awesome
- Water pressure/quantity and electricity system (missing adjustment but looks good)
- Good motivation system. You need to dig a lot to achieve higher tier stuff.
- The shopping system, getting the equipment and putting it to work feels right. 

Minus
- Weird and unfinished physics. The water bucket annoyingly falls through the carry box instead at least snapping in and being locked. Equipment slips unrealistically, like slowly drifts sideways. The buckets... they should not tip so easily. 
- Where does the dirt coming out of the wash plant go? It is just gone mysteriously.
- There is a mobile generator, sized of a toolbox, which produces 500 kW and drinks like a liter per hour. That is a miracle! A 500 kW generator is a size of a smaller locomotive engine, weights several tons and drinks like 100 liters per hour. The electricity needs serious rebalancing, the mobile genset should do 5 kW, there should be a towable mid tier genset doing 50 kW and the big container, that should do 500 kW. Of course consumers rebalanced, such way that the small gen can handle the cleanout small table, mag sep, nuggetator, the mid tier gen could run the mobile washplant and so on. 
- Same with the water. 100000l towable tank? That would be 100 tons, good luck towing that with a car. Big pump doing 200 liters per minute? The hand moveable pump should do 1400-1500 liters per minute.
- Whoever comes up with kW/liter values in the game, should learn to use google and research. These equipment are based on real ones, just google the specs, and balance it to the in-game mechanics.
- Loans are insane. This is not the early gold rush...
- Time compression is used the wrong way. What is the point leaving it at the default 12x? That makes you 12 times less effective. Leaving it 12x means while you digging in real time for an hour, every machine consumes the amount required for 12 hours. That also ruins renting costs. Just why? Time compression should be 1x by default and it should be quickly adjustable when waiting for something. 
- The whole revenue/cost system appears to be intended to be balanced for the 12x speed in a weird way. But who wants to play with 12x speed? However in normal speed, fuel consumptions feel realistic, but power, liter and gold catch values are way off. I can make like $100K per hour? Real miners would be happy with a few thousand dollars per day.

Little more on the negative side, but I still love this game. It has very good potential, but looks abandoned at early access phase. Needs balancing, fixing and content both in mechanics (like different type of gold, washplant setup for the type, and optimal working, sluice slope, water quantity, rtc) and models (multiple type of  washplants, multiple mining equipment).

After coming back to the game, still every bugging, the graphics still using to much ram, my excavator expoled and then the game became a treeless world. Rebuilding the wash plant for 20th time, the game crashed over and over then sent me flying.

i would love to see mod support for this game as i feel it would bring this game to life a lot more with new machines to play around with.

multiplayer would be amazing and would make the base content more fun and make the leader boards more competitive.

as for the games current state, id say its good. game play is smooth and does provide entertainment for a good while.
but after i put some hours in, you start to feel the world become more empty and your idea to dig the deepest hole becomes limited due to map floors.

if their was a Gold Rush 2 game, id like to see mod support/workshop  , possible multiplayer , and something bigger to todays standards.
what i mean by that is a environment that is more lively, ai traffic/ npc's (human and animals), maybe more shops to buy newer equipment/ mod equipment.

id also like to see tunnel minning as a possible option as well. (maybe with mine carts and bucket lifts to move materials out of the mine shaft?)

Tried to play the game again after quite some time (See below post date). Game is a lot clunkier than I remember. Started renting my land, bought some supplies and it got far too tedious while just loading the equipment in my truck. Not sure what they've done, or if its me having lost interest after playing so long in the first stint but its not worth it at this point (still).

Wait for more updates. The game is fun for a very niche market. Very repetitive (Journal tells you as much). Number of bugs/issues to get past:

Save game corruptions
Environment doesn't load after loading a game (successfully)
Game freezes at specific parts to render the rest of the map
Some parts of the Journal/DigTube aren't very clear with regards to equipment/machine requirements
Broke the game once when the tools in the back of my truck phased through the truck and ""exploded"" outward breaking the game
The use of a Reset button to reset your vehicle is a shoddy workaround for poor driving implementation
Filling your bucket with water and looking behind you while the animation is still going sometimes slingshots you in the direction you are facing. 

Its mining for gold. Its mundane, its repetitive, but some people might find it strangely therapeutic. Giving it a thumbs down because it shouldn't have been released in this state. Perhaps as a EA title at this price.",1508148596,1656768549,False,10,0,0.519571244716644287,0,True,False,False

I reinstalled on my newer laptop as I felt like a solid sim game but things had changed. Dramatically.

Previously progression was steady and you felt like things were moving along however now I find out that workers don't work. I mean if I hired them in RL I would be pretty pissed if I was paying them and all they were doing was 8% of the work and only while I was the one doing the shovelling.

I chose to have the ""nugget bonus"" which originally felt a little cheap however when all the nugget dried up it was such a grind. Progress is hard and it feels like such a big leap from manual work to more automatic. The controls are not super nice to use which is not a huge deal for the most part however when to have to run between the hogbox and the dirt turning around and aim so that you tip the dirt it does not feel great.

Brings me to the lag... When I first got this it was smooth as, on a 4th gen i5, gtx1060, 8gb ram.
I have now an 9th gen i7, RTX 2060, 16gb ram and half the time is is smooth the other half is 2-3 frames a second. Loading times between areas is a nightmare also. I swear it was never this bad previously. It is all such a shame because it looks like everthing for this was going in the right direction and then I guess seasons happened and patches broke things and it looks like the Devs have no want to change anything about it. So for people that don't mind a grind, and perhaps some lag (not sure what the issue is here but perhaps not everyone gets it) then sure, go for it. But for a good sim game look for something else.

Additional: I jumped back in to give this game another chance. I found that the ""worker"" who was working previously on the hog pan mats is now not working. The spare mats in the holders have been double checked and are empty. I hope that a reload will fix this because honestly I want to like this game again.",1654435509,1654437550,False,4,0,0.545496284961700439,0,True,False,False

Also performance took a major hit making it unbearable to even play at this point, I used to run the game on Ultra settings averaging around 30-40 FPS but now the game runs at a whopping 3-10 FPS with only moments where it runs like it used to even with lower settings. I've uninstalled and reinstalled to clear cache since I couldn't find the cache file myself and even started a new game to get a clear save file to see if my equipment was lowering performance to no avail. IDK what to do with this at this point as I cant run the game smoothly as I've done before and running the entire mine by myself is a complete drag now and having multiple claims is utterly useless as you're only one person.

1 man can't manage a mining operation as big as some of these get. Being able to play this with say 4 friends would be so, so nice. You need someone to run an excavator, a loader, a dozer, run the plants, etc. You can't enjoyably do that as one man. 

It also needs mods. The vehicles are stale and there's things like quads and side by sides that the community could put in, and that's just a basic want.

The only thing the devs seem to keep up with are the seasons, which add no new content but change the amount of gold that appears in claims or changes the price of certain claims.

The map is still the same one since launch, with no new additions or claims. There are blocked roads that could easily lead to new places but are still there since I played last.

:steamfacepalm:100's of people literally begging for mp and devs refuse. sad because after 163 hours of game play, the game doesnt have much left to offer except go dig a hole by myself. 

About time to pull a Hofman and retire from this title.

  Agree, without a major step like like MP, the title whimpers out to a slow demise unfortunatly and a few new machines will not provide the CPR the title needs to continue with the top tier plants already being very effiecent. Washing moss all at once and rotating objects ( which should have honestly been in the begining) just isnt enough, but will say I definetly got my moneys worth.

Feel bad for such harsh words especially with a title that I have enjoyed so much and all the time and effort that went into the title by not only the DEVs but also the STEAM COMMUNITY but in the current age of gaming where nearly everything out there brings a social concept and interaction with other players, this was either an incredible oversight, or a costly decsision on the Dev part that will cost them and the community of players that have invested their time and money in this title in the long run.  


60 Hour Review: 

Great game as far as simulators go. definetly not a polished product and would still call this a beta phase at this point. I was disapointed that the DLC that is offered is not actually a part of the base game as these are really items that should have been in the base game and after buying the DLC confirmed this to be so. 

The game is a true occupational grinder as nothing in this title comes quick but that is part of the romance of this types of titles is that they actually make you work for it, from driving a vehicle to town, having to load an unload items, and set them up. I personally have spent 6 plus hours just setting up a wash plant setup in this game. 

This title is not of the quick of rage quit type set as again this is a grinding occupational simulator. I look forward to seeing what comes from this game in the future when the game is more polished.",1518583365,1648165918,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

UPDATE:

After about 8 more hours on the game, it has not improved my opinion from my initial review.  The frame rate is glitchy, there are bugs associated with the physics causing one to lose things.  All-in-all this has potential, but in it's current state it's just aggravating in the sense that when I retrained a worker to do a different assignment, he lost the ability to do what he was initially good at.  That's ridiculous considering how much money it costs to retrain a worker. Also, there was no warnings, or documentation suggesting that the work would not be able to go back to his previous assignment. I definitely will not be adding additional time to this game until some significant updates are released (i.e. more information on putting things together and having the workers be effective, graphic optimization, etc.)",1644173914,1644519776,False,13,0,0.58572763204574585,3,True,False,False

The graphics are fine, it isn't going to win any beauty awards but that's ok for what the point of the game is.

Early on you'll encounter lengthy pauses of several seconds while the game loads new terrain (while driving) Initially I saw this as a problem, and it is to a degree, but only if you spend a lot of time driving back and forth from town to plot. Once you're on the plot you won't encounter these loading pauses.

The sounds are decent, nice ambient music playing in the background can make this a calm, enjoyable experience.

For the longest time there have been many people asking for a multiplayer feature for Gold Rush. However the developers made the game to be single player only. I actually supported this decision for a long time which anyone can see in the pinned thread for multiplayer.

So one day I posted:

[quote]
Rather than make this an MP game.. It would make more sense to make the ""next"" game MP from the ground up..

In fact... someone thought of it.

https://store.steampowered.com/app/1082450/Gold_Hunter/
[/quote]

This of course included a link to Gold Hunter which is a game in development that offers similar gold mining but.. with Multiplayer...  a feature many were asking for.

Several months passed by and out of the blue I received a permanent ban to the GR forums. it was odd that it was for the post above. but it had "" publicity"" as the reason for the perma ban.  Strange.. a perma ban for posting a link to another game on steam of the same genre and on topic since this was a discussion about Multiplayer.

Clearly the developers are highly threatened by this new game which is not even released yet. So much so that without any warning they issue perma bans to silence any notion of competition.

Well if nothing else, it speaks volumes about the developers character and temperament.",1510261694,1643474265,False,3,0,0.568345367908477783,1,True,False,False

I as well as the commmunity cant understand why you would plan a game like this with no MP, worse than that is no modding, and on top of that the ones that did try to mod this to be MP were stopped, lol like wtf, it is literally the #1 and basically only request for this game other than bugs and would bring in more revenue for you and you stop ppl???

This game as stated is enjoyable and relaxing, but as you progress, the worker system is not enough for most to want to continue, what i make a bunch of money and gold and have what to look forward too? more employees, no. bigger better equipment, no same equipment thats been in game since start basically. dredging, no. What you experience in the first claim is what you get the rest of the game, just better gold, but its deeper. You implemented breakdowns? cool realistic, yes , but too frequent and annoying, again if there was a mechanic worker that would be a better choice, also limiting me to only few vehicles on claim, dumb, if my rock truck broke down, id need a mechanic to fix it and grab another in the meantime.

 Listen this is a good game if you are really about that single player just wanna chill game and think that runnin an entire mining operation alone is your bag. For the masses though Gold Hunter is right around the corner, and it will have a long way to go, the mechanics arent nearly as polished as this and the team is small rn but with mp already and much much much more content planned than this it is sure to be around for a long time to come, dredging, ice mining, basically all aspects of the gold mining process are planned.






*Edit: after over a hundred hours and taking my time between sessions for more upodates, these devs continue to improve the game to the best of their ability for a SP game, it is still enjoyable and the leaderboards gives you something to push foreward and compete, we need this one to get alot of bugs out then when they make GR2 there will be MP and will be that much more enjoyable. This game is still very relaxing to play even with all of the challenges they have put in with seasons and breakages and so on.




I have only been playing this a few hours and i can already tell this game is a lot of fun with a ton of potential, yes theres bugs but the devs have been very active and attentive to the issues, this title is already way ahead of the other PlayWay titles. The controls are good and can easily switch between controller and mouse. Most ppl are asking alot of questions about how to play and whats this and that do but the devs have videos in game and a journal that is very descriptive on how to get started and all the things you need to do. If you are a fan of farm sim and the like then this is up your alley as it is very relaxing and can kill a bunch of hours. Yes they pushed it out a bit too early and that was to match the new season of gold rush, so its more of a beta right now but as i stated the devs are all over things and this game has much potential and i look foreward to building my empire.


also ppl this is 17$ so even tho it doesnt say beta on it dont act like its a waste of money as a ""full release"" you can spend 60$+ on AAA titles that have game breaking problems at launch, i know i have, thats something to complain about, not 17$ for a good game. So please if you buy it give a positive review and for the others hopefully they change thiers and stop acting so entitled, these devs clearly arent in it for a cash grab.",1508027579,1643390648,False,0,0,0.493804693222045898,0,True,False,False

All you can decide is where you dig, and then you dig dig dig dig dig, clean and sell gold, buy new equipment to place on the predetermined areas, and dig dig dig dig dig... 
Also, the terrain is full of unusable content, many invisible blocks. You cannot even take a shortcut to the city on foot, as the way is blocked by a big piece of nothing. so you have to go around.

To make the base, crush the biscuits to fine crumbs and melt the butter over a low heat. Pour into a bowl and mix to combine. Spoon into the base of the tin and press down with the back of a spoon until level. Place in the fridge for 15 minutes.

To make the filling, heat the butter and sugar in a small non-stick saucepan and stir over a low heat until combined. Add the condensed milk and bring to the boil, stirring for 2–3 minutes – do not over-boil or it will become grainy and fudge-like. Add the vanilla and pour into the tin. Place in the fridge for at least 1 hour.

Whip the cream in a bowl until soft peaks form.

Arrange the banana slices in neat rounds on top of the toffee. Spoon or pipe the cream on top and level. Set in the fridge for an hour.

Remove from the tin, and zig zag the melted chocolate over the top or dust with cocoa powder.",1634931810,1642782733,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

After purchasing it, I worked my way up from the river panning to a major operation, but all levels had one theme in common - I - myself had to do every task, The employees in game just gave benefits, but did no actual work. This meant that I had to shovel the dirt with my front-end loader, move the dirt from equipment to equipment and sell the gold, More to the point, building the business to multiple claims would not work because you can only work one at a time, and employees do not work the others. Net result, you spend 95% of your time shoveling dirt, 5% of your time processing, selling, upgrading etc. If you are looking for an ultra-realistic game where you are the permanent worker doing everything, and your ok just operating a front end loader or shovel 95% of the game this is the game for you.

But I decided to stick with it, and it opened up like a flower. I'm glad I did as there is a lot of content, and quite good if basic gameplay mechanics. Simple things like being able to walk rather than run around like a sprinter in other games, to an option to have a full 24 hour day length cycle if you want it.

The learning curve and amount of grind early on is quite high, mostly as the tutorials don't completely explain what goes where well enough, although it does cover a lot of material you have to experiment a little. 

The performance is OK but does drop a little in places, and when map tiles load in. But it's a trade-off.

I've had a lot of fun trying to figure out the mechanics and how to get that dirt to pay out as efficiently as possible. I watched a couple of the Alaska gold digging episodes on TV recently, and nice to see this game is in the same vein. I love the fact you can buy land, survey it and dig up all the voxel dirt, with good machines that sound really great and can be operated in first and third person. 

The seasons have a good in game mechanic, so you need to operate different machines at different occassions to work the land depending on scarsity of water, and frozen earth. It's great that the vehicles can break down and a miriad of parts you have to purchase and install from time to time, really adds to the richness of the game, and reminds me of the TV episodes where they always seem to have something breaking down.

It would be nice to have placeable cameras (maybe buy go-pros at the shop!?) on vehicles so you can reverse and see a rear view monitor so you can stay in first person all the time, as reversing in some vehicles is not easy.

The game feels like it was made by people who really enjoyed making and playing it!

other end of my rant is a discovery channel based game is always going to have some form of competition to it as well. in this, they added in the leader boards so your competing against someone. what was a nice laid back mining game is now something that is no longer fun. again, this game needs multiplayer. without it, it is dead to me

update: the devs can ban you from the chat for calling this game abandonware. but a review cannot be ignored. the only thing updated on this game is its leader boards. gold rush can't get multiplayer yet it has leader boards and yet there is a new game coming out that is a multiplayer mining game. wait for that one, don't wast your money here.",1566926551,1642034593,False,7,1,0.552055954933166504,0,True,False,False

Honstely, watching gameplay videos about it, is way more enjoyable than playing the game yourself.
I could see the game being pretty nice, if you were able to play it in coop with your friends. But no, the developers seem to be either too lazy or too incompetent to make that happen.

And of course, as it is not unusual in these days, as soon as you start to be not that fanboyish in the forums, but more critical, some of the devs (like those here) are not too hesitant to ban people out of their forum. Sometimes permanently.

This game is about digging ditches to process the dirt you dig up. If you play this game for 3 hours in one day, that's a little under 3 hours spent digging ditches. Strangely that's still a far more engaging activity than what a lot of triple-A titles give for you money, but it's incredibly monotonous.

Compare the game to the Farming Simulator games and you can see the flaws: Spend 50 hours in FS and you have a wide range of farm vehicles, multiple fields, and plans for how to efficiently sow, grow, and harvest those fields. Then on top of that you might have cows, sheep, and of course your chickens.

Spend 50 hours in Gold Rush and you'll have yet another digging machine with yet another washing machine to dump your dirt into. Also a giant ditch in the ground dug by yours truly.",1641106542,1641106542,False,25,7,0.638901174068450928,0,True,False,False

If you want to read me complain about what you MIGHT experience, read further sure.

So, I played this game like 2 years ago, when it was a bad beta that got a lot of people to experience a ton of bugs, I was using an RX 440 with 2gb of VRAM, and you know what? It run at a sucky 50 fps, but it run smooth except of course for each loading screen you get every 30 secs from driving anywhere, since that isn't processed in any loading screen it seems. 
So, how does it run now that I have 16GB of DDR4 RAM with a speed of some cool 2600 MHZ, an I5 7500K and an RX 5500 XT 4GB? Well, *EVEN WORSE*, don't ask me how dude, devs couldn't even explain I betcha (if they are even still responding for this excuse of game). 
Game freezes out of nowhere, I bought it with all the DLCS it had, and it runs like butter, until it freezes 20 mins into the game, so, I did what any sensible smart techy guy does!
I updated graphics drivers, I did as devs told by installing some visuals and I tried lowering graphics and disabling everything graphical that could be disabled... I am laughingly happy to announce that this solved my issue! From 20 mins into the game freezing, I gained 5 minutes more! So game keeps freezing with everything updated and visuals reinstalled... I was about to ask for the refund having 1.9 hours on the game. Butcha know what? I didnt try reinstalling! Silly ole me. I will try that, its probably the issue.
I did,
It keeps doing it. 
I dug deeper into solutions since now I had reached 2.5 hours of game time, read about 18 cases similar and none with solution either from devs or from users.
Is it a fun game? Yeah, but dont worry, it keeps itself from having you hooked in it and wasting your life on it. Props to the ""devs"" if someone who makes a game like this can be called so.

Get into the game and you are basically doing all the tedious, monotonous BS that they thought was too boring for the show, so whoever thought ""we can make that into a game"" has no business in gaming.
3 difficulties. Easy, where everything costs $1 and you can't fail, ever. The only good thing about easy is you get the snap mode for placing machinery, more on that in a minute. Medium difficulty could have been a good difficulty but they decided that the snap machinery placement should just be an easy difficulty. Another of the numerous mistakes made by this dev company. Hard i'm not even bothering with. The machinery snap should just always be a thing since the game is optimised so poorly that 1 of many things could happen. You could get a massive piece of machinery caught on a small gas tank, ya know, the one's usually stored in a car, which will snap all your cables. Or, maybe, it will try saving or loading (for the millionth time in a minute) which goes on to crash your game after an hour of trying to place machinery on a game developed by morons. Then, the icing on the cake, the devs think they have done such a good job, they think, ""let's get more money and give them some crap DLC before even thinking about fixing our game"". And there was much rejoicing... NOT!

Can't really describe this one
mainly due to how some people
play the game, but based on
the difficulty you chose when
you started the game, it can
take from 2 hours to several
days depending on what decisions
you make for your mining company.

It’s a fairly difficult but 
challenging game, and that’s why
I love it.

Sadly, no multiplayer, 
and no cross-platform

sad you'll never be 
able to start a mining

single-player.

---{DLC + Content} ---
There was 1 DLC for this game,
and from what I've seen its
good, and for 5 Dollars or
cheaper it’s pretty worth it.
However, its most likely not 
something you'd buy until late 
game. I did not own it however.

---{Conclusion}---
Make your own decision based on what you've seen the game to
be, personally though, I found the game to be pretty nostalgic
playing it over the years, and of course I’d be happy to hear
if you bought it or not. Remember to always do your research.",1637966592,1637966592,True,26,1,0.705595731735229492,0,True,False,False

First, I will give my personal opinion on this game. Pros, cons, and some interesting update ideas for game play will be listed below. 

Opinion: This is a super fun game, but it takes a LONG time to get massive amounts of gold. It could also be that I'm just playing it wrong. I love that you are in full control of the machinery and other objects. You can also place stuff where you most desire (unless its something that NEEDS to go in a certain spot). The game might look boring, but really, it is super fun. With SO MUCH to explore, you can spend a LONG time collecting all the story pieces for the journal and finding hidden secrets. There really is not much of a story line itself, but the journal stories take care of that. I REALLY find the journal helpful. It shows what everything is and how to get it, but unfortunately, it does not show certain steps for using different objects on the Tier 3 set up.  

The stuff that really annoys me is placing the Tier 3 gold mining equipment. You have to use the big excavator to haul the equipment to its proper location, and some of the pieces are extremely hard to place with the excavator because the equipment pieces have to be in the right direction and sometimes there is just no good way to properly place a certain piece. 

Pros: 

- Graphics are really good even with them on low (but obviously the higher the graphics level, the higher the graphics will be)
- Game is very realistic (minus placement of mining equipment ~ stuff doesnt just ""snap"" into place in real life)
- I do like the fact that stuff can break and you have to replace it. Sometimes this can get annoying though. 

Cons:
- The game seems to lag hardcore when crossing the tracks to get to the blacksmith. (does anyone else have this issue?) 
- There are no other cars or people in the towns. (is this because this places are abandoned?)
- there is one area you cannot access and for some reason it really bothers me... 
- you cannot explore the insides of buildings or houses which is disappointing. You can go UP TO some of them, but not inside. 
- HOW DO YOU GET THE WORKERS TO ACTUALLY MAKE GOLD!?!?!?  seems to be a 'bug' in the game where workers dont make any money for you... but more likely, I just haven't figured it out yet... 

Update ideas:

- add people (citizens, police, firemen, EMT's, etc) and cars to the roads. (yes, i know there are a few cars in the towns, but they dont MOVE anywhere) 
- will the roads that are currently closed, ever be open?
- open up the area that annoys me that you cant enter... I feel like some crazy good exploring could happen at that location. (I'll give the location once I play the game again).
- make several building explorable and maybe add some hidden treasures like gold that was left behind from a previous miner. 
- I think exploring a gold mine (with hidden treasures of course) would be a great update to this game.
- WHY IS THE TRUCK (and other machinery) NOT UPGRADABLE!? A lot of the machinery could use MAJOR upgrades like strength and speed (half the time, im moving at 1mph or less with the big excavator). The truck needs to be upgraded BIG TIME ~ more speed and power when going up hills...     
- I know this isnt a fishing game but sometimes, i just want to take a boat out on the water and do some fishing in my spare time.


updated section

ok, so I feel stupid about the journal. It DOES show everything that is needed to know.

However, it took me forever to figure out why my equipment wasn’t working right. I changed almost every part to a reinforced part, and it still didn’t work.. then I finally found the issue. Turns out I was missing ONE WHEEL on the trommel… there was NO indication of the machine missing that part. That’s why it took me forever to figure out what was wrong…

The location that drives me crazy bc I can’t explore it, is the section right between the Henneberg Old Mine, and Aurora Lake. Simply said, the Urbanowicz Dam is what I want to explore.

I don’t know if there was a small update or not besides the season 16 (which is now  season 18) update, but the game seems to be a whole lot more laggy now, even with all graphics on low.",1630628565,1637889322,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

because it will crash at any moment and with out warning.

So the basic idea behind the game is to start small panning for gold. then use the money to make from that to buy bigger and better equipment, as well as new plots. The game does this very well, even with a few bugs here and there. It has a very easy learning curve, as well as not going some disgusting grind fest where it will take you 10 years to get some new equipment.

The visuals are solid, it's by no means a AAA looking game, but it's also not some half done rushed mess like some other games.

The controls are great, though I would recommend using something like a game pad as the two sticks really make operating equipment like the excavators a whole lot easier, and a whole lot more fun. It can be done with the keyboard, but I don't find it quite as nice.

Sound, eh, is what it is. It's not going to murder your ears, but again, it's not AAA quality.

Overall the game itself is great. My negative recommendation comes from the real lack of content and support. The game is essentially dead apart from a silly seasonal leader board, which is always filled with cheaters who somehow manage to mine silly amounts of gold, miles ahead of everyone else, who are pretty much neck and neck in the race to win.

It also really has a lack of replay value, you essentially play the same way every time. You can change it up slightly, but for the most part it's the same. Also, once you've unlocked the equipment, you basically have no real need to buy the other plots and set up all of the exact same equipment on that plot. You can setup all of the top equipment on the very first plot you get if you really wanted. 

All and all not bad, but not great. If you find it on sale during one of the steam seasonal sales, I would probably get it, if not, I wouldn't waste the money.",1636204819,1636204819,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So being able to take a trip to Alaska and look for gold from the comfort of my home has been amazing.  I have only played for about 6 hours but in that time I have fallen in love with this game and it sets in my top 20 all time favorites.  I love all the equipment and detail that has gone into this game.  And as with most guys I love the idea of driving heavy machines and playing in the dirt.  The only Con I can give this game is that the parcels that you can mine are limited.  I would love for the ability for all the land to be destructible so we could clear out and make our own roads for our heavy machinery IE cutting trees and grading like in the real show.  But over all the concept of this game are amazing.  There are tons of equipment to mess around with and the electricity and fluids management are very detailed and true to life.  If you need to power a work light just buy you one of several generators available for purchase fill it with fuel from a jerry can and plug in a drop cord and boom you can work at night!!!  This game has been out since 2017 and I am sad that I am just now buying it.  So if you are looking for a fun game to kill time and the ability to make it big with gold then check out  this game.  I mean what are you waiting for why are you still setting there reading my review click buy already!!!!!!!  No need to read any further you wont be disappointed!  And don't forget to get the Frankenstein machinery DLC it is well worth it.,1636121566,1636121614,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I get that multiplayer was too big an overhaul, but... not even an NPC at the cash register?  You can hire ""workers"" but they are a huge disappointment.  They can't use vehicles, transport things, or get anything useful done besides swapping out wash plant buckets.  It's like they're just teasing you with the idea that you might not have to do absolutely everything yourself by hand...  Because you do.  They don't even exist in the game world-- only on your tablet-- which doesn't work during storms. Huge disappointment.

Let me re-iterate that last point.  You cannot access your workers - on site - during a storm.
Huge.  Disappointment.

All that being said, I strangely keep coming back to it.  It's relaxing and slow-paced.  It's a grind for sure... but it's satisfying.

Sorry but the Devs must be like Tony Beats IRL damn cave men/women.     

It all started in the tutorial when asked to buy (4x) 5 meter steel cables (mission), The mission never registered as completed even after doing it 6 times in a row. 
So I figured maybe just a bug I will restart no big deal (so i thought...) On the second day of the same tutorial no issues.
On the 3rd day it was impossible to even load the ""saved"" game even crashed Steam client twice.
Tried to run in safe mode and put the game back to default. Again saved game wouldn't load so I decided to uninstall and reinstall the game. After doing so now the game only runs in safe mode even if  ""Play Gold Rush"" (non safe mode option) is selected.

Can't get a refund, even if I explained this, because I played  over 2 hours with it.

Then moving items into position is annoying because you can easily misplace and item because it just snaps into place. Driving your truck at any speed over 10 mph will make it bounce all over. The big vehicles are slow slow it puts me to sleep to drive them. it's about 2-3 hours of setup before you even get to the fun part.

Me personally I really enjoy this game for what it is. I personally will play this game because I got it for so cheap cause it was on sale. But I can't in my right mind tell other people to go buy this game. What is the first thing you think of with Gold Rush the TV show? Teamwork to achieve the goal of getting gold. Everyone working together. Guess what this game has no multiplayer and the developer has stated they will not put the work in to add multiplayer.

They hold a unique License to a one of a kind game there is no other game like it on the market. They are being literally like EA is with their Sports Licenses. No innovation while they have collected their money from the license. They have made enough I am sure to rewrite the code to fix the multiplayer issue. The game also suffers from severe bad optimization which causes real bad FPS drops. I will now break down Pro's and Con's for the skimming type.

-Pros

-You do feel like your on the show but solo
-Journal is a very good guide to help a new player
-Digtube which is their like video guide is very informative
-Its fun to put the time in to build an actual processing mine
-It is a good time waster to sit back and chill
-Leader Board atleast gives you some kind of multiplayer feel with prizes

-Cons

-Poor optimization which leads to crashes or fps drops ( I have not crashed but suffered fps drops)
-Trying to do everything solo is overwhelming
-They will not add multiplayer
-Placing mining set ups are very hard on some maps and that gets frustrating
To few maps
-There is no point to play anything other than leader board
-New content is very few and far between
-All they add are new cosmetic skins
-No new equipment
-Once you drill its hard to locate where you have drilled to get the good paydirt
-Clean up is horrible solo
-Water to run machines is scarce

I play and will continue to play for a while but new people unless you get this on deal I wouldn't bother because its not what people think this game should be. Maybe at some point a new concept will come along and the license will get awarded to someone else.

You can have the best specs ever but that lack of polish still gives you massive frame drops at times. Also a change on progression and how fast it happens i would say needs a rework, because just to even progress a decent rate you need to have gold nuggets on, otherwise you will spend hours at the hogpan. The game is addictive but extremely slow unless gold nuggets are on. Some in game mechanics would also need to be reworked, as the with the repair function not every part can be replaced, only some, eg. only two out of the four tires can be changed on trailers and only one piston on the dump rock. That does make no sense, which is why i think it needs a rework. Some parts also need to be replaced too soon, because four cycles with the tier 3 wash system shouldnt make the wash plants pumps break.

Graphics: 5/10
Optimization: 4/10
Gameplay: 7/10
Variation: 6/10
Content: 4/10

So this is roughly my opinion in numbers. Anywyas, we all probably know that this game is poorly optimized and that it needs a lot of work to make it even a little smooth. But apart from that I enjoy the game. It has some fun machinery I like to use, you can upgrade some parts and replace them. The damage option is sadly not random so things just break by a durability bar. The fact that you need to grind is also nice. BUT after a while I noticed something pretty nice that will never happen in real life. The drill. With the drill you can basically farm unlimited gold by drilling 16 holes in every single square in normal mode. Within a hour I earned roughly 500k from just drilling. Yes it is boring. But yes I can now finally buy the machines instead of renting them forever.

Overall I would recommend this game if you don't mind the lag and low fps and some point. 

I would rate this game a 7 out of 10. :)",1630330392,1630330392,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Code Horizon seems intent on thinking that adding common place features in most games such as Leader boards, and Difficulty Selection, to Gold Rush: The Game as ""improvements""... All while ignoring the glaringly bad optimization, bugs, physics, and a community crying out for fixes, or multiplayer, or a release of the modding strangle hold they currently have over this game...

EDIT(8/19/2021: Community Update: 
I've been ""Permanently Banned"" from the steam community of this ""Game"" for ""Disrespectful posts"" and ""False Reports"" so I've came here.
Where Code Horizon Cannot Silence Me.
This all started in response to the known Troll, Metallios, saying I've helped no one and that I was being ""disruptive"" for pointing out that a change of Code Horizons EULA would be all that is needed to allow modding this game. My response was to say ""Pot meet Kettle"" then go on to point out that changing the EULA is what we where talking about before he brought up some crap about leader boards... So after I tired of pounding Metallios with true logic, and coming to the realization that he was just looking to start an argument. I deleted all my posts responding to Metallios, blocked him, and stated such. Then, I went through the entire thread and reported every post where Metallios was obviously looking to start an argument for ""Trolling, Inciting Arguments."" Then proceded to move on with my life.

About 7 hours ago I received a warning on the post declaring my intent to no longer engage the known troll Metallios, with ""Disrespectful Post"" attached.

A minute after receiving that, I was banned with my response to CaveMonkey's reply to an earlier post of mine asking ""In hindsight, do you think 80% of the player base got scammed because I sure as ♥♥♥ do.."" my response being ""I Don't Disagree."" Attached to this was ""False Reports""

One of Metallios' trolling, and argumentative, posts is now ""Marked as the answer to the topic above.""

You smell that? Go ahead, take a good deep breath. You know what that is? That's Favoritism you smell. Where a trolling, foaming at the mouth, rabbid fanboy gets rewarded. And anyone who doesn't agree, and uses the base logic of a 9 year old to poke holes in Code Horizon's reasoning, gets the ban hammer. Yep, that's fair.

And just so you understand. Here's my rigs specs:

CPU: AMD A8-7600 APU clocks at 3.1GHz but I've seen it turbo to 3.8GHz
RAM: 32 GB of DDR3
GPU: Radeon R9 380X with 4GB of VRAM 

Now, here goes nothing...

For the pros (gonna be short):

1. The game is quite beautiful.

2. You get to drive/operate big machines.

3. You get to dig in dirt for gold, to buy more big machines.

4. It's very calming.

See, told you it'd be short. Now for the cons... I hope you got your reading hat on:

1. ""The game is quite beautiful."" Or it would be if the game wasn't so horribly optimized that you'll bottom out the graphics trying to combat the low fps, I'm talking low 20's consistently.

2. ""You get to drive/operate big machines."" The more of these you have, the worse your fps get.

3. ""You get to dig in dirt for gold, to buy more big machines."" Uh yeah, doesn't help the fps any...

4. ""It's very calming."" Or it would be if the physics weren't a janky mess. Walk into something immobile, you're stuck. You'll have to move away from the offending object to go anywhere, no wall grinding for you! Go to take a slight turn in the truck at speed, pull instant 180. And so much more, but on to the important stuff...

5. The team at Code Horizon does not listen to it's community. More on this soon.

6. This game is fully released, and marked as complete... Seriously, I'm not joking...

7. No Multiplayer in a Unity based game? Are You Nuts?!?!? Yeah you heard right, this game was made using Unity and there where No Plans to have/add multiplayer. The community (see told you there'd be more on this) has REPEATEDLY asked for multiplayer to be added, and Code Horizon made a pinned discussion here on steam for us to talk about it. 

Their response was:
""We here at Code Horizon know that the community would love to have Multiplayer as part of the game. Unfortunately, it’s not possible for us to implement without rewriting 50% of the game. Instead, we’re continuously working on other features."" 

I'm sorry, do what? Did you say: ""Sorry, but we're to lazy and incompetent to put work into our product."" that discussion has since been locked so no one could continue the discussion of multiplayer implementation into the game.

With a final reply from Code Horizon of:
""The end has come for this thread as almost every possible question has been asked and answered.

Thanks to those that kept it civil and contributed to some good discussions.

Please direct anyone to this thread for them to look through if they need anything answered about MP and please do not post any MP threads on the forums.

Thank you."" *shaking my head* More Can Always Be Said, You just got tired of listening to/interacting with your community...


8. Okay, no multiplayer, that's fine. How about modding support? 

In a Discussion on here their response to the question of modding support was:
""modding the game the way people are wanting to mod it will be a huge task and not worth pursuing hence why no one has bothered. If the game is not open to modding then there is no point trying."" 

Okay, so let me get this straight. You made a game in Unity, one of The Most MODDABLE Game Engines On Earth With MULTIPLAYER FUNCTIONALITY Built Right Into The Unity Engine And DO NOTHING With Ether Of Those Options Available To You?

*speechless with dumbstruck look in face, brain says ""make words happen"" mouth says ""ERROR: Does Not Compute"" drools instead*

9. Okay Death, just breathe buddy, it'll be okay. How about allowing modding of the game with out support from you guys?

Code Horizons response has been EDIT(10/22/2019): To Me:

From: Codehorizon_Mod_Community

""Unfortunately, due to the extensive amount of code, that would have to be rewritten to allow modding, we are not able to implement such feature.""

A falsehood (*cough* lie *cough*) that is constantly being force fed to the community at large...

In conclusion:
Well you've read this far, why not add my own thoughts to this. Although I suppose I already have XD...

Most, if not all of, the problems listed in the cons section of this review could easily be fixed by a modding community that is chomping at the bit to get at this game. But since Code Horizon does not allow modding of the game, it seems they never will get the chance to improve on the base of this game. Which is surprising to me, considering this is billed as a simulation game. And as far as I know, the only simulation game released in the past four years that does not allow modding in any form...

If you have nothing better to do, and already own the game, then this is an excellent time suck. 
That's why I have 200+ hours in game, that and dreaming of mods and multiplayer while playing, looking at the dump truck I'm filling with the excavator going 

""If we had mods, I'd have a multiplayer mod enabled. A friend would be in that dump truck, with another friend in a second dump truck, and a third running the wash plant... *sigh* oh well...""

And for the reasons listed in the cons section of this game, I cannot currently recommend this pitiful game. 

If Code Horizon comes to it's senses, and adds multiplayer, or allows the modding community to finally do their thing, I may change my recommendation...

EDIT(10/22/2019): Although I seriously doubt this money grubbing, greedy, and pitiful excuse for a ""Game Studio"" will do anything even close to coming anywhere near logical sense... Save your cash for Kerba Space Program 2, Or any Farming Simulator made by Giantz

Which is a shame because that would have provided longevity and frankly more interest in the game. I think I read somewhere that the dev said they would have to rewrite 50% of the code to make this possible. Personally, I think they should just bite the bullet and DO IT. Easier said than done to say the least.

I could gripe about the fps drops, poor optimization, etc. But eventually they will either iron this stuff out or they will scrap it and make a new game. This will probably be the best route for them at this point if they ever want to make a game they can actually be proud of. 

That's about all I've got for negatives. To some, that's enough not to buy the game. So don't buy it.

However, I am going to keep playing it. I accept the game for what it is, flaws and all. To what some call boring, tedious, and repetitive- I call peaceful. This is just one of those games I can zone out in and relax. This coming from a person who gets frustrated and irritated (just like dealing with my ex wives) and in a lot of other games. This one just lets me fix equipment, dig, and solve problems. It's simple, but challenging enough so that I don't get bored. 

To increase the ""fun"" level and the reason I have played so many hours- I have my equipment controls on a HOTAS and I have a heavy equipment controller clamped to my desk as well. It makes it loads more enjoyable. As a side note, I have many hours of IRL experience running heavy equipment and I am now permanently disabled.

Having recently come back to the game after a 3 year hiatus and therefore re-learning all the mechanics - I have some new observations: :MightyMiner:

  - The new flow and length mechanics are nice additions, as are the weather FX and draught 
    features.  The overall feel of the game is still very barren and apocalyptic though.

- The Loader still needs some love, under powered for the most part. :MightyLoader:

- More machinery options, higher horsepower and bigger excavators perhaps as
either DLC or unlocked via in-game goals (preferably the latter). :MightyBulldozer:

- Some more upgraded pickup truck options (think Dodge RAM Super/Heavy Duty or
Prospector). We really need a larger bed for that rigid crate storage to be meaningful.

- As above - ability for crates to be both rigid inside trucks as well as contain rigid item placeholders inside them - i.e. like buckets on the gold processing machinery. The toppling tower of hoses and motors is a bit much for even those withTetris levels of patience...

- For any newer players - options for weather warnings of incoming heatwaves or cold
weather/storms - Sometimes we get so engrossed in mining we forget to check the
temperatures..a beep or flash banner would work. I now plan for these with tankers but a
lesson learned.

- Some actual physical AI around town, be it either static in the store or a few wandering
around, the place is an apocalyptic looking ghost town. Would also love to see the AI workers at the claim, even if its simple AI that have repair animations or look to be working on machinery. 

I'm really hopeful of a sequel with an updated engine and AI characteristics with much more physicality and of course that elephant in the room....multiplayer/Co-op (I would happily settle for local coop mode).  


Edited  comments 24/11/18.

A fantastic game/franchise idea for a niche sim player base seriously ruined by Dev/publishers rushing to release an unfinished product.
This is very early alpha at best and [b][u]NOT a finished product[/u][/b].  Where is the checks by Valve for this stuff?  This should be an early access title!
[/i]24/11/18 - Still accurate.[/i]

Memory leaks, lack of vsync, unrealistic physics and hit boxes....terrain deformation, vehicle power, day/night cycle.... all need to be seriously worked on if the player base is to stay.
[i]24/11/18 - Vsync and physics are still an issue.[/i]

All of the above leads to random, frustating crashes which resets any progress made since your last save as ALL saves are MANUAL!  Completely ridiculous not to have auto-save implemented in a modern game.
[i]24/11/18 - Less crashes and auto save time now better.[/i]

I'd make a case for co-op or multiplayer support, but as it stands the game is so broke that in its current state its simply not feasible.
[i]24/11/18 - Should have had co-op support by now, currently a lot of setup work required by one person before you get to the nitty gritty of digging.[/i]

Such a shame that the Dev's support is so poor now they have the cash in their pockets.  The game is fun to play even with all of its bugs, it's a satisfying game to chill and play with a beer.  It's just not £15.49 satisfying.

[u]Buy this only when all of these bugs are fixed and Devs actually release statements of any worth, otherwise get used to an alpha experience.[/u]
[i]24/11/18 - Game is now a fair price at less than £10.00.[/i]

[i]@Devs Have a look at Spintires to find a realistic representation of small studio surpassing itself.  All be it not a perfect game but still more polished and with fantastic physics and vehicle power/weight.[/i]

[i]Edit: 22/11[/i]

Latest patch adds little info as to changes made e.g. fuel model and $1 purchase of machines.
Sceptic in me thinks they're treating paying customers as QA testers; something you wouldn't really associate with a supposed full release title. 

Still a massive problem with memory leaks and FPS goes as low as 6 FPS while using big excavator! (i have a Geforce 980ti).  Seriously unoptimised.  The dirt is also still bugged when moving it using front loaders and bulldozers, T3 almost beyond tiresome to work with and reasons to keep shifting paydirt now dwindling due to the above.

[i]Edit: 24/11/18[/i]

Now more options for dig sites, new machines and equipment, all be it through paid for DLC, which i thought should be much cheaper or even part of the original game.

Changes made to gold smelter is interesting, finding 'stories' around the map to add perks to the smelting encourages exploration outwith the dig site going to town and back.  It will take a while though before you see a return on this.

Object collision issues are still very annoying, e.g. gates and fences snagging trailers or walking and being stuck in a small hole or dirt pile.

The weather/seasonal system is very welcomed and gives you more of a feel of actual gold digging seasons.  Not sure if the dirt changes properties from winter to summer with permafrost etc.

Equipment damage is realistic and linked to the weather.  It makes you think what spares to grab from town or put on order for delivery to claims for a small premium.

As mentioned above, the game would be much easier and fun in co-op with friends.  Unsure why the developers can't do this.  Even local hosting would be acceptable.  Even though the game is extremely fun, it's just needing this badly.",1509904394,1628348107,True,0,0,0.73690032958984375,22,True,False,False

This game is so frustratingly broken... and they won't even allow you to edit the save game files anymore.

I feel like if the save game files were editable, then people might forgive the glaring bugs, and broken gameplay mechanics. 
 But this game really needs some work.  Unfortunately I don't see the devs fixing anything properly, as some of these issues have been around since the original kickstarter release.

There are simply too many flaws in the game for it to reveal it's potenial. 
Graphics and movements are clunky and vehicle handling is simply a disaster... but if you realy enjoy simulator games you could push past that and enjoy the game. 
What really ruins the game experience for me is that the pay dirt is always the same in each spot. 
To explain, in ""Hard"" you never get any nuggets, they are not VERY rare... no, they are turned off and locked in the game settings... this added to the fact that the pay dirt is always the same,  each pan is the same !
You get roughly the same amount of gold in each pan ! Never an empty pan and never a good pan.
There is simply never any suspense, exitement or disapointment when you pan as each pan will contain roughly the same amount of gold each and every time. 
You can acctually calculate how many pans the bulldozer will cost you, this is game breaking for me and the game quickly becomes repetitive and predicable. 
Sure there are different quality digging sites but once you dig once you know excacltly how much each pan in this spot will yeld.

In conclusion, a good concept with poor game mechanics and a failed fun factor. 

Buy only if you dont mind the repetion and/or agree that pay dirt that yelds an average of 26 onzes per bucket should yeld exactly that every single bucket. 
I will admit that I did like the game untill I realized this and started calculating prices in number of pans instead of gold or dollars !!!",1624487901,1627057016,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The actual gameplay has that sort of undescribable PlayWay janky feel. If you've played a playway game you know what i mean. The driving mechanics are janky to say the least. The town the game is based in feels completely dead and lifeless, even for Alaska. There's also a not insignificant amount of frame loss when driving from one part of town to another.

Most of what you'll be doing involves digging up soil with the excavator, putting it in the wash plant, repeating for 20 or so times, extracting the gold from what it spits out, selling the gold, repeating 20 or so times until you can afford a new machine, etc.

I didnt expect too much and the first visual impression is not that good. But when u get startet and want to earn ur fist gold its fun and exiting. 

Fun if u play with nuggets. But after some time, checking all stuff in the shops and making plans to improve ur business, u realize u have to be unemployed and completely crazy to get anywhere in this game. Dont get me wrong. I loved it to get my fist t3 washplant ready (Transport, Installation, first cleanout) and went to work, but to get there i didnt even play the game properly. after t1 i thought i have to search for the good spots and rented a drilling machine. With that thing, i got nealy all my gold by drilling my parcel with the rented machine on timescale 1x. (u get up to 500g gold nugget from drilling....) All in all i got about 50.000 gramm gold. Thats more that a million $ and it take much less time than digging.

Real play without nuggets its the f..... maximum of a hell of a grindfest. I mean that. It cant get any worse. The only thing u have to do is digging with the excavator and getting more money to get better parts.

On top:
- u are completley alone. There is no npc or any other life that some soundy birds.
- noone can help u. No mp, no npc, no worker or anything. U have to do ALL by urself.
- there is no real story
- the blacksmith is a scamming f...tard.
- the bank is a scam too....
- ur workers are lazy perk jerks and the lvl up is ridiciously slow.
- i got a 2070s and a 3700x and the game has unacceptable fps drops
- there is a bug that the FE-Loader deletes the gold from the dirt when u are excavation from the bedrock. wtf? Devs that cant be it right?

Do urself a favor and invest ur money in a game which is not as grindy as this game unless u have too much time and a veeeeeeeeeeeeeery long breath.

Conclusion:
Pros: Realistic alaska gold mining.
Cons: everything else.

Let's not worry about the fact that I probably should have not given this game a second chance, and filed for a refund just minutes after I installed it. I guess maybe I was hoping that I was just having a rough go with the game, and probably just needed some time before I would learn it, and maybe find it to be enjoyable.

But as you can tell, that didn't happen. With a grand total of 50 minutes, just short of an hour, and even after two tries, I found the game/simulation to be repulsive to the point that I uninstalled it, and will never ever try it again. Sucks to be me huh? I shell out some cash, because it really looked fun on YouTube, but in my hands, it was garbage.

So keep your 16 dollars, and in the future, I'll learn to not give crappy games a second-chance, and immediately request a refund if it's not going well. My loss... and I'll be more prompt with refunds in the future. Maybe I can download a bunch of games, and if I don't like them, or don't have time to really try them out, I'll just refund them... over and over again. I mean, why should I alone be the one that wastes my time and money, when I can affect your customer service reps?

Sixteen dollars... or a hundred and sixteen... a refund is a refund if it's valid for only two weeks. As long as I spend less than an hour on each, I can take you up on your refund system, without any hassles, right?

I love this game! Its everything I could dream of in a start-from-nothing-become-rich type of game. Your hands on. Your in control of lots of things.

However the game is few years old or so now and even though its great - the game runs pretty rough. It isn't optimized well. I am running Geforce GTX 1660 ti, 16gb memory, Intel i7-9750 and should be able to run this game on ultra. There are TONS of games I can run that came out around that time frame that I can play on ultra. Heck I just beat RE Village on ultra settings with no issues at all...

But this game - constant FPS drops. You can turn on FPS counter and its never steady - its always bouncing all over the place. There are times I will go into the town the the FPS will drop to like 5 while LOOKING at the town. If I turn away - all is good. Turn back - FPS drops... 

The game is not optimized. And from what I hear across the forums the Devs don't seem to want to fix this. Its like they gave up fixing something that breaks players from wanting to play their game.

I have even tried all the graphic settings - constantly bouncing around. And like I said, people say Devs don't care and are only focused on seasonal leaderboards now.

Also - they are likely focused on on the CONSOLE release. I sure hope the console version runs better or goodbye good reviews. And I am sure the console release for players who have not been on PC get this and are fans of the show and see all the old machines and not what we are seeing today - that will hurt their ratings as well.

Now on a different note. I love the shows Gold Rush and Dave Turins Lost Gold Mine.... Dave was in Gold rush for awhile.

Anyways... The game came out and by the looks of it the game only has like seasons 1-4ish of content. And I just started playing - I would expect updates to the game introducing new equipment we are seeing in the show.

There is no workshop - modding abilities. I am not sure why... I think that would help greatly add stuff from the shows.

If Devs want people to have faith in their game - you don't abandon the discord. You don't ignore suggestions even though I am told they are relayed to you by the community mods. Devs should be more active in their discord. I am 100% Positive the Suggestions box === recycle bin.

The next game they are making looks... I am sorry to say it bluntly... dumb... stupid... boring... But I am sure it'll attract some kind of crowd.

I am also one of the few players who is happy its singleplayer.


In general... its a great game, I really like it. But in terms of how it runs and the content = that hurts the game. I was told the Devs used to be on the Discord for talks and now they are gone and only the community mods relay information back. That to me tells me they REALLY do not care. I think the Devs should seriously make a sequel to this game with an updated game engine, updated machines, and better optimization. This game is likely one of their best sellers. Also the devs need to return to their community. This is such a great game and it sucks its basically dead in the water.",1621843122,1621843122,False,22,2,0.643201768398284912,0,True,False,False

I personally love the game for many reasons that I will get to but I also have some cons for this game. First off with the game are the pros. I love how many machines there are and that you can set up different types of wash plants like de-rockers and trommels. The multiple claims are cool and the different challenges to get to then. The digging and vehicle mechanics are pretty cool and the game is a great time waster. They recently added to the workshop and its cool to finally have some of the things we have in there now.  Now onto some of the cons I have found with the game. The biggest one is that there is no multiplayer in this game and the devs don't seem to have any of that planned so if you want a mining game to play with friends, this is not the game for it. Another issue is you need an ok computer to run this game. Another issue is when travelling around the map, you hit certain parts of the map where it loads the new section in and even with an ok computer it still takes some time to do and if you have a bad computer, the load will freeze you and sometimes if you are transporting things in the back of your truck, it will go every wheres and is a pain to clean up. Even though this game has some cons, I would recommend it for people who like the TV show gold rush, want to experience something close to mining or want a interesting time waster",1620657119,1620657119,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I had heard that this game was a cheap version of a bad TV show called Gold Rush,

therefore my expectations were LOW for this game.

Booted the game up for the first time, and had MASSIVE frame drops, Bad sign.

Changed the quality settings, and was pleasantly surprised by how big the map is, most of which the player can't really interact with, but looks decent and adds a bit of world building.

I decided to skip the tutorial thinking this would be an easy 'go here, do X, go here, sell X'  type of game.

I was extremely wrong. I hadn't bought any equipment or a lot at all. I then opened the journal and found out that there is not only a tutorial I skipped, but a helpful guidebook BUILT INTO THE GAME FOR DUMBASSES LIKE ME.

I found out how to RENT a lot and what to start out with.
Traveled to the lot, and then found out I had to ASSEMBLE my equipment, which actually was simple to do, 
Then I started to dig up dirt, plop it in the sorter, and wash out the dirt to sort it, basic gold prospector stuff (that I have no experience in, so I will not be commentating how ""true"" it is to real life.) I then had to pan out dirt chunks to find the actual gold bits I started this entire thing for, which after a bit of fucking up controls, quickly got the hang of it and, again, it's actually pretty fun to do. I then came out with 8 whole grams of gold, which I had no idea what to do next, so I referred back to the journal which told me to go to the blacksmith and smelt my gold so I could then sell it to the bank.
Thought it was a pointless trip, so I went, smelted it and.....wait a minute, it takes actual time (ingame, therefore is under the same 12x time multiplier as the player, thanks devs.) I had a 30 minute timer, which would be converted to 2 minutes of actual time, where I could go fuck around town finding collectibles. Came back, got the bar, chucked it in my truck, then went to the bank to sell it with no problem, and I note that the price of gold changes per day, giving the player another mechanic to work with, I love it. I then bought upgrades, figured out how to set up a water pump, and I am currently on working towards making more profit to automate digging a little more.

I have only played this game for 3 hours, and I already recommend it if you're into tycoon games.
There is a real sense of starting out from near nothing and working your way up the ladder, which is real satisfying, and not something that many games struggle to do.

As I understand, this game is based on some TV show, which must have been a total economic failure, because the budget for this game is clearly way below average.

However, the gameplay is fun and addictive. I just wish they would make it look nicer and sound better.
The town this is taking place in, is like a ghost town from a horror game or film. The streets are empty, just a few rotten cars, at least the church bell and the gas station still work.

I really like how they did all the cable and hose management. There are a bunch of different generators, water pumps and all that stuff a real gold digger would want.

Recommended. I will likely buy the Frankestein DLC for 2,5$.

--Update after reaching 40h--

I can say I had a lot of fun in the game. The beggining was awesome, reaching tier 2 too and reaching tier 3 was fun but also hard. The amount of work you have to do is incredible. Just installing tier 3 took me 3 days in game. But, the hardest thing, is taking all the dirt with the excavator, the dump truck and repeating all the process one time, another, and another, and another...forever, because you have no employee that work with you. I mean, image Gold Rush Parker running all the thing alone...its impossible (well maybe for parker is possible XD), you have to be the operator, engineer, manager, laborer of all possible types...all the work is up to you so...it has not any sense. While is fun you can check all that by yourself, you should be able to have employee to do the most tedious work (like taking and moving arena, at least).  

So where the game fails is this, there is no progression in terms of your responsibility / title. You can't get promoted even though you are the boss, because you are also the only worker XDDD So since things don't happen alone, you can't alternate between working (as an operator ...) and doing other tasks that require less effort and time invested.

Otherwise, the game is great and has a lot of potential, but it seems that it is no longer receiving updates. It seems that with the launch of consoles the game could revive, I will put attention in the future, since for now I leave it here, I can not invest so many hours of my life in taking dirt and taking it to another site XDDD lol",1618956337,1619277801,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I really want to say good things about this game, but I just can't recommend a game that had so much potential, and should have been completed, but it hasn't. As you can see I have a lot of hours on this game and tried like many others to help with issues, and faithfully supported them, by playing, reporting issues and things I thought would make it a great game.
Always was helpful to new players in discussion, if I knew or was able to assist them with their questions or what I had learned by game play. 

Then they added Leaderboards, and we went through updates, then patches to fix what the update messed up. 
Now Leaderboards is all they seem to support.

I am sad that it has come to be in the state it is in.

This game Had so much potential when it was first released. Only huge issue is, the the developers don't listen to the community. I.e fixing certain bugs which I see on there discord all the time, adding newer modelled machines along side the old ones to liven the game up and make it more thrilling and enjoyable to play to have something to work towards getting.
There is a bull dozer in this game which is pretty much useless and will get its self stuck when ever you try to push up a pile or cut a haul road/track meaning your going to have to reset it a far bit. On the other hand the developers are way to focused on releasing seasonal updates along side the TV show this is based off, and on the most part 9 times out of 10 wont add anything new to those ""updates"" they call them to make it less lonely or dark and gloomy, or fix little things which make the game not enjoyable.

To sum up my rant and rave, i wouldn't bother with this game at this time. I'd either wait till there's more of these types of games on the market or have a look around at other games coming up.

it's really not what I expected and it has a bad optimization, my pc meet the requirements but the fps isn't stable, it drops to 30 and below when you are in the shop because too many stuff are been rendered at the samae time and the game isn't optimized very well, so expect issues, and the gameplay it self is kinda of good but the technical problems ruins that, and there is no multiplayer and as the devs said that there are no plans to add it as that will make them rewrite 50% of the game code and instead they are focusing on adding new features to the game and more content as I understand from what they said, and it's fine to me if they don't want to add multiplayer but at least fix your game please it's so buggy and that really ruins the fun of the game for me, and the textures for some reason doesn't load probably I mean when I get close to it, it appears to be low resolution then after few seconds it get's it's full details, I think they might tried to optimize the game or something but it seems that it didn't work, also when you get that big bucket and the pan to wash that dirt thing and get the gold it takes like 2 seconds to load and when you are in the pan mode or what ever and when the game load the world or save while you are moving or something it freezes, every time it does that I always think that the game just crashed or something but no it's just the loading process, and it's running on unity engine so yeah don't expect a great graphics, I mean yes you can make great games from unity and get a great graphics but unreal engine is way better and it might helped in the graphics but it's too late now so yeah this isn't helpful now unless they want to make the whole game again in a different engine, the physics also aren't that great from what I saw, last thing I want to say about this game is that it might be fun for some but if the devs didn't fix the fps problem then yeah get an RTX 2080 TI to handle this buggy game and have fun.
in the end I don't recommend this game at all right now at least, Hopefully they will listen to there community and do something about this game and fix the bugs like getting stuck at the stuff. seriously that's annoying.",1560531145,1615142784,False,3,1,0.423076927661895752,0,True,False,False

It starts out slow and you gotta really grind to get to the large equipment. It's reasonable, and even if you have all the money needed to get all the equipment to the site, it can take a while to set everything up with all the large equipment. I do like how it's not just a ""purchase and it shows up at the dig-site"" as this adds more content to the game that is not all that much artificial. Overall, I enjoy the amount of content in the game.

Next aspect I would like to discuss is the automation. The way the game is, it really should not be a single-player only game. With the large equipment (not DLC) it is nearly impossible for you to not waste fuel, as it processes the dirt too quickly for you to have a constant flow of paydirt. All the tasks that have to be done are too much for a single person to do efficiently. I would love to give the game a positive review if there was multiplayer, and would recommend it to friends, but that is not something I will do due to the current lack of multiplayer in the game.

Finally, I would like to talk about the liveliness of the background, as in the towns having people and the dig-sites having AI doing even non-progressive tasks. All of these are non-existent. Not a single other person to be seen. If there were even AI to help with the digging, such as assigning them to work in specific areas of the dig site doing certain tasks, that would really make the game wonderful. Unfortunately, the game gives off the vibe of a ghost town and you have nobody helping you at all with the digging, or any aspect of it. 

All these aspects being said, it is a game I would not recommend of you like automation and enjoy things working efficiently. If these things were to change, I would definitely re-evaluate this game, and likely recommend it if the game is positively changed and improved.",1614890383,1614890383,False,6,2,0.542050361633300781,0,True,False,False

I'm sure all this is falling on deaf ears though. It seems there's no more support for the game, and the only thing the devs are concerned with are some ""leaderboards"" which most players could care less about.",1614090905,1614090905,True,39,2,0.788988947868347168,0,True,False,False

Devs are making the wrong choices the, polls for how to start season 2 on steam and facebook were completely different in results. Still alot of people wanted option 2 so it's really weird it's not in the game. The option 1 people could start a new game anyway..... 
Also some of the mods in the community are rude and think only their way is the right way, and they don't know how to handle criticism.
Annoucing a paid DLC when the base game is at best still in beta.
With season 2 saying bye old bugs but hello new bugs, lost a trailer twice with normal driving.
The slot system on the claims is stupit even a sluice counts as an slot. With tier 3 plant and big excavator, dump truck, dozer, big generator and big fuel tank your claim is full. I don't use workers but i'd like to have all heavy equipment there without switching and paying transports cost all the time. A slot costs 500k after slot 15!!!! They are fucking crazy who pays 500k to allow a machine on your own claim. 
There is a 1 dollar mode in the game but it's not the same as earning everything yourself.
And then you lose everything in a new season.........

The name of the game is the same as the tv show but there's nothing similair but the gold.
I really don't understand why Discovery wants this lame ass broken game with devs that apparently don't know what they are doing connected to their awesome tv show.

Don't buy this game it's to frustrating.

All of this would be a moot point if there was multiplayer or some kind of ai to help take the grindiness out of it but there is not, and based on dev post, never will be.

the game is not bad at what it does its just too damn tedious for one player alone. Adding larger machines of some kind would really solve this issue but thats not going to happen either and its just kills the fun out of it which is a shame.

- Manual labour has never been so beautiful <3 prepare to load your truck, shovel dirt and wash rocks!
- The machines are well designed and actually take skill to operate!
- Graphics are pretty good especially at night!
- You go shopping for parts and can get a loan from the bank!
- You can refuel your truck and water pumps!
- Hooking machinery to your truck is manual labour and needs you to leave your truck - don't forget parking brake!

2. Lack any kind of friends or soical life
3. Don't like mutiplayer
This game is everything i both love and hate. I don't mind the grinding for cash. I don't mind the 10000 different machines to need to set up....What i do mind is the fact there's no and i do mean NO! other type of humanoid in the game. shop is blank and basically leave your cash at register, you can hear kids and off noises in the back giving it an abandoned / ghost town look. Not a single sign of life other than you in the small town. I'm playing a gold rush simulator here, Not a horror game.

If they ever brought MP into the game (wouldn't be that difficult) it would be a bit better. But I've ran into far too many bugs and way too many issues to recommend this game to anyone who has bare minimum interactions with other humans online.

Do as you wish however. It is a fun game for what it is and isn't",1613072646,1613072646,False,5,3,0.503346145153045654,0,True,False,False

Came back after 2 years to see how the game improved and it really did, I am not getting motion sickness from it anymore and the framerate is finally at least playable

I love the concept and the gameplay is sweet too, but texture loading delay and problems with gamepad are a pain sometimes

ps 
like this so the devs see this 
PLz devs im so tired of Going back and forth with buckets
I NEED A biGgEr shovEl for that hogging pan
a mini rc dump truck would be cool aswell
or a simple fix would be to use the crates for dirt storage and then you grab a bucket and keep loading in pay dirt which would be easier and more realistic if that was the case

Dirt Pump 2.0 an automated mini machine designed to fill 20% every 10 secs all it requires is it allot of gas and  allot of dirt designed to kickstart miners career
it also fills crates and buckets 
the machine works by sending a transmission to the hog pan and back indicated when it is full so that the dirt pump 2.0 can stop 
its designed to automate and if this were to exist in real life it would make working conditions easier 
some ppl say the dirt pump 2.0 often works like a cement mixer breaking down chunks so that the gold can come clean easier 
this could help save millions of dollars on equipment that also do this but are heaver and require more water
this could rlly help irl and on game for those who would rather keep on a smaller mining operation

Items fall out of the pick up constantly and the transport boxes are just as bad. This cause item loss and pure frustration in having to drive back into town to obtain a replacement. I lasted until setting up my tier three wash plant. Even on easy with quick snap wash plant placement this was impossible. Using the digger and cables even properly fixed would invert items when lifting, the tracked vehicles are unable to move on anything other than a flat surface, hills just aint happening. My digger fell into a dug hole due to my bad driving, but its currently on its way to Narnia on my screen and is unrecoverable, even with the reset item function, as it really really wants to go see Aslan
 
Pros 
Until tier 3 enjoyable peaceful game that requires a good amount of attention whilst letting the mind wander. I found it great for listening to music or audiobooks whilst keeping my hands busy.
Cons
Tier 3 is the ceiling due to unusable vehicles
Bugs bugs bugs bugs and more bugs
The items falling out the transport boxes and truck bug is marked fixed in patch notes. Its very much not
Devs dont seam to care at all. Three years after release and the game remains in my opinion a deep alpha and nothing more. Nothing has reached its potential.

Its a harsh review for 50 hours played but Im gutted that the bugs are preventing me from progressing and that the major bug issues im encountering are not apparent within the first 2 hours of gameplay preventing a refund",1611280843,1611280843,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Love having all the stuff to buy and use, hoses, power cords, pumps, lights, etc. but GOOD GOD THOSE PRICES! Dissapointed almost none of it looks like things you'd use on a real claim too. Im a professional miner and I dont recognise most of the stuff in game or its just off and weird like the small powered pumps, whats with the batteries on top if it has to be plugged in? Also panning in this game is totally laughable, whoever came up with that needs to go panning for reals and learn a few things. Also the CGI for water and flowing gravel is just weird to look at and who designed the placement of the derocker and other pieces of equipment, the ramps to dump waste have a foot space between them. in the real world that would mean waste rock mixing with paydirt, that stuff just bugs me. Also really wonder why they have not fixed the bug were items you interact with could randomly fly off into space and be lost forever like your buckets full of gold, crates full of buckets of gold.... the hood of your truck lol. Also the simulated water pressure feature will have you frusturated for hours! Just turn it off in options, I personally think its not working right.
All in all I still love this game even though it is poor excuse for a simulator they got the vehicle dynamics down. Definately like to see a version 2 of this game with multiplayer and actually seeing hired personel actually working lol. Maybe a 3rd person view and able to design your avatar. As well update that god awfull panning in a tub thing, let us pan at the rivers edge, expand the world so you can really explore and prospect creeks and rivers. etc. Oh and be able to buy upgraded truck, not just a paintjob, things a turd and when you have 5 mill in the bank you should be able to buy a new chevy/dodge or something.

Several years back, I somehow found the RCSparks ""Youtube Gold"" series and fell in love.  I am so happy to have this game and be able to replicate the things they were doing.  If you go into this game blind, you're going to have problems.  You really need to follow the tutorial and/or watch gameplay from other people.

Once you get the hang of it, this is such a fantastic game! It's very laid back and allows you to relax and do mindless tasks that, at first you have to think about to memorize, but after several times of doing it, it's like breathing.  You know how and don't have to think.

My only real complaints are that 1) There are limits as to how many vehicles you can have out at once on each claim.  
2) Vehicle selection is pretty small right now.  I'd love to see a skidsteer, small excavator and a smaller dump truck.

Its a shame as this game has a lot of potential, but the developers don't listen to their community, this game is dead after a couple hours, same shit over and over. I really thought this would become a winning title but as usual with early access the devs have found the easiest way to keep moderate interest in the game to keep money coming in whilst putting minimum effort into development.

On top of that, despite not adding content, they have said that they will not allow mod support either, so we cant even fix the game for them. This is one of the worst examples of game development I've seen. Minimal content, no mod support, no multiplayer or coop (Devs have flat out said they wont add this to the game as it requires too much work... lazy, the lack of effort and care for this game to progress is mind blowing) they have even banned it as a discussion topic in the community hub, perhaps the reason why people keep bringing it up is because its what we want and what the game needs to live on, ayy devs??

Until the developers pull their thumbs out of their assholes, this will be a failure. Based on how they've reacted in the past I wouldn't count on it changing. RIP Gold Rush

Turn off CPU Culling in the options and you'll experience a much better FPS. That's all. No one told me this and I was tired of trying to play so after a little messing around, I figured out this was the problem.

MY REVIEW AFTER MOST RECENT UPDATE:
After the most recent update the FPS lost is substantial. Before I could play with almost zero FPS drops unless it was quicksaving. I lowered my settings and nothing helped. Went from having 40-60 FPS to 15-25. I can play, but I have to look at the ground or deal with the game constantly lagging. I think I'm going to officially retire this from my library and uninstall. It was a great game to pass time. I was starting to go for all the achievements. 

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
After 150 hours, I must leave a review. This game is fun, until you get to your last washplant tier. Then it gets tedious, tiresome, and honestly downright boring. This game needs a few things, #1 multiplayer/co-op gameplay. #2 Mod support.
If the developers are going to let this game die, they should at least let the fans mod it and allow custom items. 

I enjoy the crap out of this game, it's a easy way to relax, and I'll leave a thumbs up for it.

My PC stands head and shoulders above the recommended specs and when I drive to the shop from my land or have a few big of machines running or if it's snowing while I'm digging, it's unplayable. No crashes yet but things like 5 to 10 fps just when walking around the shop sometimes. This game should easily be at 30-60 fps at all times, it's 1/10th the size of games like GTA, SCUM, ARMA 3, Red Dead, The Forest, Subnautica, and other huge survival games. Those games run consistently at 60+fps. Mist Survival is a decent size game that gets 30-60 frames and that's just ONE DEV that made it on his free time. I'd dare to say even DAYZ runs better than this game. That's not a good place to be. BUT I still recommend this game, I play it almost every time I sit down. It does get a little repetitive when you have to grind for a bit to earn money but it's pretty cool how you have to learn to use each machine and monitor repairs, that keeps it fresh even though you kind of are doing the same thing over and over again.

Grindy can be ok, as long as the actual gameplay is fun, rewarding, engaging, etc. Controlling any of the machines in this game however, is neither of these things and the amount of time you would need to invest to get anywhere in the game without the nuggets function easily runs into double digit real life hours. Nuggets is basically just the game giving you about 5-10x as much gold as you would get from actually using the gold sieving machines for free at random points while you are digging up the terrain.

I can't even fathom how some people play this without the nuggets turned on, digging in the sand with a shovel for 4-5 hours (real hours, not in-game) just to get enough money to buy the first tier of automation.

I play a lot of games that are or can be grindy and are based in simulation. FS19 or recently Fishing North Atlantic, for instance. But there the grind is actually fun. Machines operate well and the gameplay loop is engaging and entertaining. This is just a poorly made, poorly optimized and poorly supported game, which is a shame, giving how much fun it could have been with just a little bit more thought and love put into the game design.

I think the tutorial put me off with how glitchy and not helpful it was. You're best relying on the journal for help and youtube videos.
Also, if you start the game with the lucky nugget turned off you're going to be in the Hog Pit for days! I'd use the lucky nugget mode until Tier 2.

Previous review:
I love the TV series and recently discovered this game, I was super excited to play

I've only played an hour but so far I'm thinking it might be easier to move to Alaska and start a gold mine for real!

Controls are clunky and difficult, with a controller its slightly easier but not 100% user friendly 

Great idea for a game and a LOT of detail has gone into it which is good and bad. It's almost too life like 

It think there's some work needed to make the game more fun and easier to play.

The worst part about all of it is every time you deposit a load of dirt, you barely fill anything up.  The efficiency is awful.  When you move from hand shoveling to the excavator you start to move exponentially more dirt, yet your gold pay out is only a little bit more.  The prices of machinery are obnoxiously expensive and when you calculate out how much gold you need to sell in order to upgrade your operation, well, I just closed the game instead as I don't have the time nor the desire to grind that long.

You can turn everything to be just $1, but that kills all sense of progression and isn't a mode I'm interested in.

Unfortunately, that was because the tutorial just throws you into a Tier 3 setup and tries to explain it all to you and how to run it. It's a bad design choice. If you skip the tutorial and go straight to mining your own plot, the game is fantastic. Just read the journal and go about it that way. There's only a few downsides to the game after having played it for 24 more hours. The machines are drastically under-powered. You have tracked bulldozers and excavators that can't make it up a tiny hill of dirt. It's ridiculous. The lack of multiplayer in a game with this much work is also a serious black eye. 

Other than that the game is tremendous fun. There's lots to do and you're always looking to upgrade and progress. I highly recommend it.",1604347775,1604347775,True,5,0,0.587794303894042969,0,True,False,False

Developers - Please understand that making something hard for the sake of being hard is not fun...yes I am speaking about driving.

So I need to go to town...it should not take 1 hour to get off my mine site. This is not challenging or fun...its punishment for your lack of creative ability.

For starters my game saves or loads every 10 seconds...causing control of game to lag. My computer is not new and internet is not fast. But the driving controls in 4wd or 2wd are sloppy. You made it this way to make driving harder to simulate 4wd off-roading. FAIL.

I turn and game loads, saves or overreacts and I go from tree to rock to post etc. I quit my game not because concept is not fun, or mechanics of mining is not fun. Its fun and interesting. Its just the driving.

So for free here are some ways to improve the game. Driving should be hard but its not a driving game off mining site. Try flat roads with mud that slows you down. longer route if you must punish your players. But making it near impossible to drive is game breaking.

Final thought, how about making fast travel a hardness option....oh wait you made it cost money...so we have to grind like heck to avoid your poor design. i honestly don't understand the reasons your keep this design when the rest of the game is great.

Did you put your brother in law in charge of the roads? Buy this game for the mining leave the game due to BS roads and steering!

    Dat excavator though....   If you settle in with a good controller or dual J/S set up, it is really sweet.   
Default control set up feels pretty natural,   and remapping controls to match the set up you like would be easy.  (  ISO or SAE )     Making this a fantastic game for chilling and watching Youtube or w/e on the other monitor. You have to do something besides load often enough to keep you from being bored, random breakdowns are annoying.    Ummmm about that....

It's very interesting game where you start from panning for gold in a metal tub, to creating a gold mining company of your own. The game is grindy most of the time, where you shovel dirt from one place to another, whether that be with a spade or an excavator, or even a front loader.

A game-breaking bug I am plagued with is when I load into different areas of the map, my GPU usage spikes to 100, and my entire computer slows down to a crawl. My youtube videos stutter and i'm sure my GPU starts crying. This only happens when I drive to the town from my dig site, and the only remedy is a compete restart of the game. If they fix this bug, I would fully recommend this game.

Cons:
-The vehicles do not always act in a realistic way. Your bucket on the excavator might get stuck in the dirt, or on a wire, or another vehicle and it takes a minute of fiddling to get it out. Your front end loader might get stuck and not be able to drive over a tiny little bump or dip in the terrain. etc. 
-Physics can be really glitchy. You can pick up a crate full of miner's mosses and have them shoot up into orbit for no reason. I have also had my front end loader glitch out and fly across the map, smashing into my truck and mobile fuel tank and shunting them both into the hillside under the terrain. They were fine after resetting them, but the physics can get pretty noodley to say the least. 
-Framerate is a mess. I'm convinced that even if you had a NASA supercomputer you would still get dropped frames, stuttering, and freezes entering/exiting menus.
-Even on max settings the graphics leave a lot to be desired. The individual textures look ok, but seeing them on objects in the game world is rough. Jaggies everywhere even with max AA, weird lighting issues, dirt textures disappear, lot's of obvious pop-in, and optimization issues.
-The controls feel quite floaty, yet somehow are just precise enough to get the job done. When you pick something up some objects allow you to rotate them for easy placement in a specific orientation while others do not. So placing a spotlight in a specific place at the correct angle can end in a 5 minute battle of frustration as you repeatedly pick up the light, drop it, watch it fall over, then rinse and repeat until you get the pixel perfect angle for it not to fall over after you drop it.
-Feels like you are almost constantly refueling everything all the time. Jump in the loader, spend 10 min digging and you are out of fuel. If it wasn't for the onsite big fuel tank it would be unplayable. Also fuel is like $11.57 a gallon so prepare to spend a lot of your hard earned money on gas. 
-Worker spawn rate needs to be drastically increased. As it is, a new worker might show up once every 3-4 in-game days, which is not cool when their main skill is random and you need one for every vehicle, every piece of the washplant, plus an overseer and mechanic. Workers also need to progress in experience to unlock the more useful perks, and are SLOW to level up as they only gain experience when the washplant is processing paydirt. In my game I had 17 workers and was dishing out about $10,000 a day in worker wages. 


Pros:
-The game is relaxing and fun to play. Pretty straight forward... Dig dirt, put it in the washplant, clean out the washplant, repeat. 
-Gives a feeling of accomplishment as you progress through a claim and can see how much paydirt you processed.
-No real ""end-game."" All the upgrades just let you process more dirt, make processing more efficient, and make the processing faster. At the beginning and ""end"" you are still just dumping dirt into a machine to watch gold come out the other side, the difference is what machine you are putting it in and in what quantity. 
-Tutorials are there and for the most part are pretty good.
-Devs can be a bit derpy, but they update the game regularly, patch bugs, (mostly) listen to the players and adjust things accordingly. Early in the games life there were two groups of players, one group wanted a hyper-realistic mining simulator, and the other wanted a more casual fun experience where they could swim through all the gold they mined like Scrooge McDuck. This forced the devs to kinda walk a middle ground before ultimately siding more towards the simulator player base. Several systems got reworked, for example instead of workers passively mining a small amount of gold ever couple mins, they now work as a perk system that increases the efficiency of your washplant and do useful things like swap out buckets and miner's mosses when full. 

Conclusion:
The game is worth getting if you can deal with it's faults. As I said it's fun and relaxing. The kind of game you can play while watching a movie or show and just want to unwind a bit. Be prepared for weird physics stuff to happen every once in a while and save often.",1600958342,1600958342,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Some improvements in the last few days. The game is now playable, still wouldnt recommend it yet though because there are alot of bugs and its obviously a work in progress.

Update 13/09/2020:
So I decided to give this another shot. Still pretty terrible. Extremely slow to make any kind of money. You need to spend hours upon hours shoveling dirt into the hog pan at the beginning. Yes there is a ""creative"" type mode but for people who dont want to ""cheat"" or would like to play a career, be prepared for many hours of shoveling.

Initial Review:
Completely unplayable, feel really suckered into buying this. 
First play - crashed just after loading. 
Second play, player got stuck in a 1 foot hole I just dug with a shovel. No way to recover. 30 mins play time wasted.
Third try, frame rate dropped while driving (it pauses to load the next section of map every couple of minutes) when the frame rate came back I lost control of the truck and crashed. And so did the game. 

This game would be getting critisism as an early access title let alone a game that is supposed to be at version 1.05.

Wouldnt recommend buying until the devs get their act together. If it was released as early access I would have more sympathy.",1508178582,1600024293,False,5,0,0.498704642057418823,0,True,False,False

The devs make bizarre changes in gameplay and don't listen to players. An example of this is the workers you can hire, which they broke entirely, and refuse to change back to the way they were. The game is also horribly unoptimized, slows down over time, and requires frequent restarts to keep running at a decent speed, even on top of the line hardware.

My experience with the game this weekend has especially soured me on it. The devs uploaded a patch meant to start season 10 of the leaderboards. In doing so they also broke crucial elements of the game, making it unplayable for 99% of players. Then they failed to address the issue and instead took the weekend off.

This game is a major letdown. It has really good potential, but fails miserably.

1) No Metal detector gameplay. It would be a natural thing to do in this game. In RL even the big machinery operators use it regularly. It would be a logical 1st step to collect your first small pile of gold which you could then invest into heavy machinery.


2) No random. After only a few minutes of playing, the player knows that one shovel of dirt equals 4 x 1% of Mat filling (Tier I mining). So to fill up the Mats, you need exactly 100 shovels of dirt. Then you get the gold from the mats, which will be 5 grams / mat. Maybe a little more, but never under 5 g.

This basically kills the whole purpose of the game. You always exactly know how much gold will you find. You lose the excitement of happening upon a richer patch, or getting annoyed by a poor result. No, you always get (I wanted to say find, but that is not a really good word here, right?) the SAME amount.

From here, the ""hunt for gold"" becomes repetitive labor, since there won't be ANY surprises. And I understand, that in RL, the gold hunting is indeed really hard work and very repetitive. But RL the results always vary. They can and do ALWAYS hope to find the big one, the million dollar nugget. Here? Nope. 5 g / Mat.

For me, the only hope here was the random nuggets, but that was very poorly implemented again. You just get a text message that you got a big one. They are also quite big, the size which the real gold miners rarely find. I'd expected small, few gram ones, and rarely, very rarely something bigger. 

But even these dry up after a while, when the game thinks that now you have enough, so even if you selected the option to find these, you won't find them.


3) No multiplayer. And not even hope for MP, as the devs stated, they would need to rewrite half the game. Seriously, they must have considered that this game would naturally require Co-op MP. Almost every RL gold miner work in teams, especially those who use heavy machinery. So they had to know from day 1 of Initial design, that MP is a very important part for a game like this. 

So I smell something here, because I'm sure that devs wanted MP, but they were not allowed to do it. It is not even hard to do it in Unity engine.


4) No gold weighting. It is just a small issue beside the other ones, but then again, that is the most important part in the gold miner TV shows: learn how much we found. Of course, here we know beforehand, so it wouldn't be as exciting.


5) Fixed placement. You don't plan, carefully consider which equipment should go where, what would be the perfect spot. You just fill up the prescribed spots. You can't move your gear somewhere else, which would suit you better.

6) To say something good too, I liked the music, never got bored of it.


All in all, it is a huge disappointment. It has huge potential, but widely misses the most important marks. I don't recommend it to anyone.

The bulldozer is absolutely worthless, I repair heavy equipment for a living and i have logged my fair share of time in the seat of equipment over the years. tracked equipment should not get stuck on small ant hills. this game needs multiplayer something terrible as the grind is real. it seems that the devs have pretty much gotten their money out of it and the content coming out holds little value as far as game play improvements go. yes i would recommend this game as i have enjoyed it. its quite the grind. the gap between the mobile plant which is barely better than using the hog pan takes a large amount of time. the gap between the stationary wash plant tiers took me less time than it did to get from the mobile plant to the stationary plant.

Everything here is just OKAY and nothing above that.

Now you may be wondering why I am saying don't get this. This game at first was pretty fun. I would go as far to say enjoyable. But...that was back when I had hope for the game. It has been well over a year and very few issues have been fixed. Basically to sum up what I would say about it into a short story is this, they put a band-aid on a severed limb call it good. They absolutely REFUSE to change anything major about the game (even if it is stuff for QOL and to make it better in general) and you wanna know the response they had when people asked them about big changes or ideas? ""It's to much work."" i mean just simply adding an NPC in the game is to much of a burden for this team and probably won't ever have any. My opinion is, wait for Gold Hunter, that game (I'm calling it now, will KILL THIS GAME FROM LAUNCH!!!) will have many more features, a more competent team, will have CO-OP and more to come.

I played countless hours of farming simulator (focused on custom maps meant for the logging) just to play with cool and big machines. I stumbled on this game and as it was kinda cheap in sale + it has machines I gave it a shot. 

The shot lasted longer than I expected (~ 13 hours so far). The textures give me mixed feelings. Some details like the rust on the vehicles are great but trees and bushes look like crap. And not only that: they have this tendency to bounce in the wind like they are on steroids. 

The physics and game mechanics are horrible. I personally would say the worst in this genre. Not sure where to begin. Things that just launch themselves (if they are big you most of the times can find them although I am still searching for a big crate that launched itself during loading at the store). Small objects (like poles or plants) that are tougher than a bulldozer and will halt your journey without any doubt. Parts and items (like hoses, wires etc) have a weird way of interacting with each other resulting in a uncontrollable pile in the back of your truck when you have been shopping. 

If you ignore the horrible textures, bad physics etc. than the next thing on my list would be the weird vehicle behavior. Somehow they feel like they have no power. I would expect that when I get on board this big bulldozer I would feel like I got all the power. But no, it feels more like you are riding a lawnmower. Like every small pebble could make it bounce up and every root in the ground would be able to stop it. Same with the front-loader and excavator. Some vehicles feel too slow to be realistic etc.

So yeah, got a lot to complain. Too bad as in it's roots it is a fun game with some depths (like breaking parts of machines, the various steps and tools needed to process the gold dirt etc) that have so much potential but than basically this whole vibe is killed by this feeling the world is so limited. No you cannot take a shortcut through those trees, don't touch the scenery with your machines as it will stop them etc. It feels like you are caged in a concrete world with plastic toy machines. 

So in short: Great game in concept, worst freaking physics and game mechanics that make you angry and frustrated. Will probably play it for another couple of hours and than probably never play it again. 

Regarding recommending: Tough one. If you love machines like I do, maybe it is something but be warned: You will be frustrated.",1593293062,1593293062,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Even when using it to dig, it wont get that very bottom layer of dirt, and if you do manage to get it, it's takes a while.

My only real issue with this game is that it didnt feel like it was completed. You get to the end stages of the game ( the tier 3 stuff ) and you feel like you just did a massive amount of work to deal with a bunch of 5 gallon buckets again. I know the developers are working on the game still but seriously if you are putting out DLC and you dont even have a solid end game...

2020 Update: So I went back to see if this game had come any further. Its still highly tedious and dull. The game just feels like a job not a game. The work to reward ratio does not feel rewarding and as far as I can see the updates have not really changed much of the gameplay. I really like the concept of this game but its implementation is weak at best. Sound is alright a little glitchy at times. The map has a few buggy areas and overall the finer points of it are dull. The introduction of seasons, to me at least, is pointless.

Do not expect this sim to give you everything you want straight from the off you have to work at it and build up which is part of the process. There is a $1 mode on here so you can get everything you want straight away but where is the fun in that ???

Several gamebreaking bugs a few examples here:
The pickup truck throws items out of the bed, or they simply fall through.
Trailers will bug after a bit of time, making them try to roll over on their own.
Items that has been bought randomly disappear, either clipping through the ground and falling through the map, or just going poof in general.
Autosave STILL causes freezing (this was a 2017 issue)
Still crash issues with specific processors and graphics cards (this was a 2017 issue)
Installer is broken if you have the collectors edition and you will have to manually delete corrupted files as you're installing.

First of all you have to shut off the engine in the car and turn on the handbrake, otherwise items will just fall through the bed of the truck (this is not at bad.) The bug that breaks the game is when you take an item out of the truck and try to drive the truck again. The game recognizes the item as still in your truck even though it is out of it.

After upgrading my hardware I gave the game another try. To make it short: The game still sucks!
- performance has improved a little but it just runs better because of much better hardware

While it is still very unacceptable that developers fully release games in such a state, they have worked hard over the years to finish the game, and it has come a very long way and is finally in a more complete state with most bugs, features and issues fixed.
It also features quite a lot of new content and it continues to be updated even to this date.
There are some minor issues and poor design choices left still, but those can be mostly ignored now.

However there is one point in this game that made me almost instantly uninstall and get bored with the game.

It is the moment you realise that the engineering side of the game, and how you build the wash plants, is completely static, tiered and set out for you.

For example, each claim has a location where you can build certain equipment, you can only place certain parts in certain areas. And although you can buy a mobile wash plant that you can put anywhere, there isnt any real customisation or sandbox features in terms to creating the actual wash plant. And so the only actual creative process in the game comes down to where do you dig (which is also partly layed out for you), and what equipment do you buy (not a huge selection at all)

If you like sim games, this certainly gives you a boring job to do, and progression will be kinda slow (very, very slow if you don't choose nuggets!  Please choose 'yes' on nuggets!"") 

Unforunately, a lot of the busy work is pretty unrewarding,  Giving you new 'toys' to play with comes very slow, and ineffective as most of your time is spent on just digging up dirt, going though different positions for different machines.. and ulimately just spending thousands of dollars worth of money/gold,  because you processed a little dirt.   

That daily cost is a bit too punishing,  and with nuggets, becomes trival to the point of little effort being put in.  You either have stupid amounts of money. or low amounts of money..

*Despite* that.. I would generally give this a good review! except.

The actual system this game is working on, is terrible..    Graphically, it's nothing impressive, but there are often stutters, frame drops, frame hitches and stalls,  the loading phases for parts of the map are very common and often hold the game when travelling anywhere for 5-10 seconds, with the next loading transition being just feet away from the last one sometimes..


The lighting is nice when it's bright out.. but anytime the sun is out of view, the game is ugly, dark and pretty depressing.


Buyer beware,  really.. but if this game interests you,  it's good for what it is.",1588874191,1588874191,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I ended up trading in my shaker rig for a derocker and the problem seems to be solved for whatever reason. Unfortunately, I ended up in so much debt to get the derocker that it just wasn't sustainable. I was putting out about $150K a day between the loan, claim share of the gold (rent) and my workers. After trying for several game days to keep my head above water I finally said, screw it, this wasn't my fault to begin with so I went back a few saves, sold my shaker for what it would give me, set the game to easy and bought the derocker for $1. Now I will set it back to Normal and see how it goes from here. Still not changing from Not Recoomended yet due to how frustrating this game can be. If they had a ""still on the fence"" rating I might consider going for that. They should put just a little more work into this and it would be very playable. Or maybe the things that need fixing are just really, really broke and it wouldn't pay for the devs to fix them. Not sure...



Well, after 267 hours of trying to gut out this frustrating mess of a game, I may be throwing in the towel. For as long as this game has been out it should be way more polished than this. I have honestly seen better games in an alpha release. I can work past the performance issues and lack of optimization but the physics and the way things react in this game are horrendous. Constant glitches and no console or way to work past them other than constantly going back several saves and losing multiple days (in game) worth of work is far from enjoyable and this just pretty much breaks it for me. Discovery and Code Horizons should be ashamed of themselves for not doing more justice to what could be a super fun and enjoyable way to pass the time. At first I would have recommended to wait and buy it when it went on sale but now? Nah, having worked my way to Pine Valley just to get a T3 set up with a shaker that only shakes by itself (as soon as you put sluice in the whole thing just stops regardless of what order things go in) leaves me saying ""hard pass"" on this one.",1587853247,1588283707,False,25,7,0.635703861713409424,0,True,False,False

This game has a huge potential for updates.

I would also recommend to the creators to add NPC's or random interactions to make the game less ""lonely"".

However there are some downsides to it and I can see why some of the people trash talking it feel the way they do and I'd like to respond to a couple of the negative reviews I've seen, from the perspective of a player that has spent many, many hours playing it (please note however that I've accidentally left it running on many occasions, so the hours I've actually played are lower than the total hours played by a fair bit).

Is it glitchy?  Yes.  Believe me, I've seen some really weird stuff, like a replacement part not fitting into the spot for a broken part, once I remove said broken part.  I've also seen the mobile wash plant's display disappear many a time, particularly when repairing it, but saving right then and immediately loading that save fixes it.  Annoying, but not game-breaking.

Does it lag?  Yes.  Specifically when driving between a claim and town, there's a spot where it always loads, causing a lag spike for a few seconds, both ways.  It also tends to lag when you save, but neither of these are tremendous lag spikes if you have a decent gaming PC.  If you alt-tab out of it for a while (as in multiple hours) and then come back to it, yeah it tends to lag pretty hard.

Do they add more content?  Yes.  They're constantly adding stuff.  Not just DLC stuff like the Frankenstein either, but non-DLC stuff like the electric water pump and many other pieces of equipment, so stop complaining that they never add anything.

Is the game poorly optimized?  In my opinion no.  Believe me I've seen far worse (Ark: Survival Evolved comes to mind here) and it tends to run fairly well.

Is the game finished?  Not even close from the looks of things.  If you can't stand the ""poor optimization"" and ""lag spikes"" and ""lack of content"" or the game otherwise doesn't live up to your expectations, just wait for the devs to finish working on the game and buy it then.

On a side note (this is for the devs): Someone mentioned they would like to see more claims and I don't really disagree with that, it'd be nice to see new places to mine.  However, one HUGE thing that I saw someone mention and I would LOVE to see is dredging!  Specifically suction dredging, though I think a bucket dredge would be really cool as well.  I know this is supposed to be based on the show Gold Rush and not on the show Bering Sea Gold, but they're nearly the same thing and as an avid scuba diver in real life I would absolutely LEAP at an addition like that, even if it was a DLC.  I would pay FULL PRICE for a DLC that had suction dredging/scuba diving for gold and I NEVER do that, I prefer to always wait for a sale.

Bottom line, I would seriously recommend this game if you're a fan of the show.  One of the few games I've paid full price for (I usually only buy games on Steam if they're on some kind of big sale) because I was just that psyched to play it and didn't want to wait around for a sale.  Absolutely worth every single penny in my opinion.  It ain't perfect, but hey it also ain't finished yet and I'm sure when it is it'll be absolutely phenomenal.",1544944988,1585298430,True,30,3,0.676969647407531738,0,True,False,False

I was not expecting to like the game as much as I do! The digging mechanics and ground management in general is fresh from a simulator side and if you like business heavy choices in how you build your empire and manage your dig sites, this game has scratched that itch for me. Throw in the competitive nature of a fresh start leader board run, I'm having a great time!

Cons: 
The physics are a little odd, but predictable. Once you get it, you know what to expect and how to work with it. 
Graphics are not top tier, but that doesn't bother me that much. 

I would love to see another DLC of machines or another map. MP is a MUST in Gold Rush 2 though, huge opportunity! 

It's a no brain decision on sale if you are the farm sim type, and even not on sale, I have most certainly got every penny of my money! Get to running that pay dirt!

NO multiplayer or Co-Op and the Devs are hard set that they will NOT add it as its too hard... the game is fun for the 1st couple hours while your're figureing things out but once you get past that steam refund point, then its just tedious and boring... (oh and the repetitive music in the game makes you want to fall asleep, at least you can turn that off.)

so in a nut shell heres what you will be looking forward to when you buy the game and get past the 1st 2 tiers of gold mining styles being ""hand filled hogpan sluce"" and then up to the mobile washplant that you can use an excavator to load.

for tier 3 which is a standard washplant like youd see on the show with some interchangeable parts, 
you have to dig (with excavator) and load the dump truck (rock truck), then get out, go to the truck, get in and drive to the washplant, ( which you have to build and takes like an hour) , dump in the washplant then drive back, park and get out go back into the excavator to dig more and load it again.and do this over and over and over and over and over and over and over and OVER again............. plus making sure all the pumps, generators and machines are fueled so that everything doesnt come to a screaching hault... just so you can make gold that you cant really do anything with other that buy/rent a new claim or buy more equipment to look after....

 ontop of that you have to take out each grate and then the  mats  when they are full and rinse them in a bucket (to get the pay concentrate for the gold pan or wave table) and put them all back. and if you need something like a hose or whatever you have to drive all the way back to town to buy it and drive all the way back.. 

theres NOT another person in the game weather its NPC or not..

game has/had soo much potential but seems like the devs are too lazy or lack the skill to be able to impliment what almost everyone who has played this game has asked for MULTIPLAYER OPTION.....  

on the plus side the game looks nice except for when you're driving to town and it has to stop (freeze the game for a few seconds)  and load the new area every 30 seconds ..

controls on the machines ""Excavator"" are spot on but they are severley under powered but hopefully that will be fixed in an upcoming patch..

oh they also have made it a rule on their discord to not ask or talk about multiplayer or co-op because so many people have been asking for it and they just refuse to listen and ignore their customers.

if they change their stance on the games final vision and do what their customers want then i will update this review accordingly.",1524879711,1583649675,False,2,0,0.516652464866638184,0,True,False,False

Stop telling lies, for god sake i am sick of people like you just talking crap for the fun of it, nothing gets deleted unless it needs to be, before you start to talk more rubbish go look for stuff and if you can't do that then just don't post at all.


My advice buy it on sale or better yet not at all. All the good stuff is not yet ingame  and will be paid clc content , The many bugs have yet to be fixed as they working on paid dlc rather than fix the base game

Couple more recent posts to further illistrate the comtempt for players who dont shower them with praise . and my favorite is the the one that states well half the players have no issues so why botyher fixing things for the other half lets just make paid dlc instead.

Iguess, but its unstable for some and fine for others so there is no real point to halt all progress on other things just for bugs <- my opinion.

Maybe I did cut one or two corners there, but honestly this is the way I see this train going. Won't be any happy places there.

If the game bothers you this much why are you still here? Every comment is nothing but negative, if it is that bad then uninstall the game and move on
Lovely attitude towards paying players grab your money and run.

Well took a 2 yr break would off refunded but was over my 2 hr limit. I can say after two yrs its not really improved , Simple things like remapping controllers dont work. They just  did an update and loader spawns is all wonky thier solution is to simply use the restore feature which now has a limited use due to a timer they added. Leaderboards seem to obviously indicate ppl can hack them. Nothing really new map wise a couple new machines and  still buggy.

Either A
Announce gold rush 2 with MP

B
Rebuild the game!

Why?
I could almost guarantee 3x the sales.  My friends havent bought it because no MP.  There is about 6-10 of them that would get it.  If you did all this work for single player, double the work and triple the pay.  I don't understand why not unless you are making a new version.

Also
NEW MACHINES!
Skins are cool but I would LOVE to have a choice of say excavators. No 2 is not a choice, its more about your bank $.

The game
The game is pretty immersive but still simple. There's 3 different difficulties you can choose; easy, medium and hard. On easy mode you can control every setting in the game and the harder the difficulty you choose, the more restricted, and harder, it becomes. (1$ mode, bear attacks, parts breaking down) You start out as a poor miner with only 500$ to your name from which you can buy a tier 1 plant. The game is build around 5 tiers, with tier 4 and 5 being upgrades of the tier 3 plant. With the tier 1 equipment you can do some small scale gold mining in hogpan area's on each claim (provided you either bought or leased the claim) to earn enough money to buy yourself into a tier 2 washplant. This consists of a mobile washplant and an excavator. Once again you need to earn yourself enough money for the next upgrade, which is the big washplant each claim has located in a different spot but is configured the same. You have a shaker, a trommel, 3 different sluice boxes and 2 jigs. You now need to earn even more money to upgrade each component to the next level. In short, you have equipment with which you earn money to buy better equipment to earn more money to buy even bigger and better equipment.

My experiences
I bought this game not long after it was released. Because it was on sale i decided to buy the Frankenstein DLC with it and to be honest, you really should. The game is very fun to go trough for the first time, but after a while it becomes quite annoying. Why? Very simple, the game is build as a simulation. Because of this you have to do everything yourself, and with that i mean everything. You have to dig the earth, move it to the plant, keep an eye on fuel levels and how much water you use, how full the sluices and jigs are etc. That in my opinion is also the major flaw of the game. You get immersed into an environment where you just need more people. This is why i think you should get the Frankenstein, it takes away one of the chores you have to do. I've got two big saves and a few test saves. One save i started in the hogpan area and worked my way to the top and in the other big save i bought a Frankenstein in 1$ mode and sold it to give me some starting money. Ive had a lot of fun mindlessly digging for gold in between classes at college.

Pro's and con's
As mentioned in my experiences, the major con of the game is having to do everything by yourself. I think this game would've been a great hit if it was developed as a semi multiplayer (4 players max) or if more processes in the game are automated. Yes the worker system where you can hire people to boost the effectivesness of certain parts of your operation helps in some regards, but even that has its limits. Annoyances aside though, this is the best game i've encountered so far that lets you use heavy equipment rather freely. You have a plot of ground you can move on where ever you like with your excavator, you can push earth with your bulldozer in whatever shape you want and the controls for the heavy equipment arent that difficult. 

Summary
I found the game a lot of fun during my first playthrough, theres a lot of different things to try out and understand about the game and if i look back every update implemented into the game were good ones. But in the end i have to give it a thumbs down. Why? Because the game has a real good concept, but after the roadmap was completed (over a year ago) there havent been any major updates, just some little tweaks here and there to fix bugs or introduce new skins. It just becomes mindlessly performing the same actions over and over again while there is so much potential to make it a big game by introducing new machinery, more automated processes so you can become the boss over a mining team (NPC or other players) and other updates.

I hope you had some use of my review. I dont really write reviews often, but i think this game deserved one.",1582824314,1582824314,False,57,5,0.737166225910186768,0,True,False,False

Only fix is to save and reload. Also, every few seconds, everything will freeze and ""load"" for a few seconds. I don't know what the hell it's loading but either way, it really just takes way from the game.

Dont buy this Bug, or Game... Its still shit, devs are completely incompetent or lazy... There are still a shitload of Bugs around, some of them since initial release. 
Play Hello Kitty Online, it offers more value for your money than this piece of Crap....

[20.10.2017]
After 3 Updates/Fixes the Game feels still like early-Alpha... its like that with each Bug fixed, two new plopping up making the Game even worse.
The whole game is still boring after a few Hours, ""X Amount of Dirt gives Y Amount of Gold..."" No Hunt for the Glory Hole, Paystreak or Bedrock...
You still stuck with a 26 Ton Excavator on a 1cm Pile of Dirt (TEAM UP WITH SPINTIRES NOT DISCOVERY CHANNEL WTF!!!111)
Not recommended to Buy!

Too bad that this Game is only about filling Buckets and washing Dirt... No new Claims that you can acquire manually, no ""Glory Hole"" that you can hunt for, no Fluctuation in the Amount of Gold you will get, depending on how deep you dig or where... Only scripted events (like that 39oz thing)

If you're looking for a game like this it's kind of your only option, its a shame the game goes out of it's way to make everything suck. I don't mind the difficulty in fact I quite like that but there are so many examples of the game making things that shouldn't be difficult downright infuriating. Hiring employees for example do nothing to automate your business aside from menial tasks. The bulldozer is useless and it along with every other piece of heavy equipment has no traction, climbing ability, or horsepower. This game could be a full on tycoon simulator but it's hamstrung by a single player, do everything yourself perspective, set in the story of a show.

I really hate the Gold Rush TV show, and I *wanted* to hate this game, but I don't - this is my initial review, I will update this later as I progress through the game.

[b]Pros:[/b]
- Decent realism; surprised to see pay layers and drill log information, that's not normally something people know about; also has pumps, generators and larger gen sets, you can even pan for gold and unrealistically get every gold flake with the snuffer bottle on the first try.
- You can hook onto and haul trailers, load up equipment, gas cans, and gear.
- Physics are okay for the most part, they can get a little dicey when you do things like run trailers over though, which you really shouldn't be doing anyways.
- You can completely ignore MSHA and do as you please, this is probably my favorite aspect of the game - goodbye 30 CFR, you won't be missed!
- For a game based on a TV show, effort has certainly been invested, the base mechanics of the game actually work really well.
- Things break; just like IRL things go sideways and can ruin your whole day; unlike IRL however, this rarely results in furiously smashing tools into machines or crawling in the mud under them while cursing your own birth.

[b]Cons:[/b]
- Graphics are a little dated, not terribly though, and certainly don't make the game unplayable.
- Machines are weak; I was a little surprised when the excavator wouldn't pick itself up, which is crucial when operating them IRL and vital to moving up and down vertical cut faces, turning, and working on them. Tracked equipment also gets stuck easily, which almost never happens IRL unless you're in seriously nasty deep mud.
- Controls can be a bit to get used to; I run almost every machine in this game IRL (except drills and the Frankenstein), with thousands of hours each (including wash plants) and I had to completely remap the controls to even dig a shallow hole with the excavator. Thankfully that was very easy and only took about 20 seconds.
- Can be hard for lower-end rigs to run, some parts of the town can become extremely laggy, and I have a decent setup. This usually happens suddenly and will often just go away just as suddenly later on.

[b]Things I'd like to see implemented in this game:[/b]
- Northern lights in fall and winter!
- No nighttime in summer, most of Alaska stays mostly daylight throughout summer.
- Tailings and groundwater - the water table in most of Alaska is only a few feet down, cuts constantly fill with water unless your pit management in on-point. Tailings are a constant hassle, I can see why they aren't in game, but I wish they were.
- Cleaner machines - this is a personal pet-peeve, a lot of mine equipment does look identical to this, but I've always taken good care of my equipment (with one single notable exception).

So, sorry for the extremely long review, but I believe if you're going to do something, do it right. Feel free to ask any questions in comments (I will not disclose what mines/companies I work for though). Thank you for reading.

P.S. Everyone saying it's boring and repetitive, [b]welcome to gold mining[/b] - just turn on some music and focus on doing a better job.",1581316412,1581316412,True,115,5,0.906478345394134521,7,True,False,False

If you really like, and I mean to the point that you get off just at the thought of excessive grind and micro, then this game is ok. I keep coming back ever so often to see what has changed and I have to say, over the course of the game it's not much. There are so many glitches and bugs that make somethings just annoying to do and others so hard you might as well not do them at all. It takes so much to get past the early game if you don't play on the easiest difficulty with the gold nugget setting on, which means you get huge nuggets frequently that buffer your cash massively, that the grind is terribly boring.  When you're using the big excavators, expect hideous graphic glitches as well as physical issues that will never be fixed. When you push the bucket down into a hole you're digging, the camera just goes ballistic and destroys the land graphic so you have no clue where your bucket is in reference to the dirt. Not to mention good luck even seeing into the damn hole from any angle that makes it possible to see what you're doing. So the solution is to use the dozer and make paths right? HA... try it. I don't understand the few people that have managed to get that thing to work. The bucket gets stuck on literally EVERYTHING and hardly moves dirt, it actually destroys it last I checked which means you lose money so that's fun. The dump truck is probably the only thing that works correctly and even then, it's buggy as hell and hard to use right. 

To wrap it up, the controls are really not that great. The graphics aren't that great. The game play isn't that great. Have fun running the excavator's bucket... Also enjoy the terrible lag spikes with every auto save and the terrible frame rate for such a low quality graphic game despite the monster of a PC you own.

1) The game crashes on exit. Not a problem, at least it doesn't crash mid game (so far)
2) It doesn't autosave when quitting. Losing 15-30 minutes of effort because you'd think it would have the common sense to autosave or remind you to save is annoying to say the least.
3) Whilst it does a reasonable job of emulating a complex process some things are just annoyingly repetitive and actually unrealistic.. only being able to carry one little plastic bucket at a time, having to spend 5 minutes running back and forth to move 4 buckets across the site is rage inducing.
4) The physics often really suck. Driving vehicles and having them stuck on something only to tear the vehicle apart is also rage inducing. Losing the two front wheels of your pick up or spending 10 minutes stuck on a fence post in an enormous digger with cat tracks is pathetic.

Really wanted to like this but just cannot recommend. Overly complex in too many areas. Lacking polish in a number of areas.

I would also like to add that as nice as it is that they have added new machinery to the game, that comes as paid DLC and not as part of the game. Gee. Thanks.

Thats my resume of this game.
There is not alot of interesting content beside some machines and sort of nice mechanics to wash gold.
You actually never see the gold in the ground or any other equipment beside washing bowl..
So the only thing you run after is to make enough gold to pay your rented claim, fuel, etc. and to buy better equipement for...?
YES for more digging, and i mean it is really only take dirt put it into wash plant, to fill one wash plant it takes between 50-100 shovels or excavator pulls...and you do this 3-5 times a day. Thats it.
I am at start of game and make some money...lets say 2000g of gold a day...but it takes 500g gold for rent;)
Uninstall game and forgett..my conclusion.

Common DEVs why not making visible gold laying around, what players can search, possibly a metal detector. Or gold veines which you can follow by digging and make big money...
Side quest to achieve something...or whatever.
The game is just to basic.

Very fun and rewarding gameplay, though it suffers from some performance issues. After 9 hours of play i can safely say that I have barely touched the content that this game has to offer. If you like simulation games that require you to do absolutely everything manually then you will most likely love this game, especially for 50% off.

Pros:
-Learn about gold mining (simplified of course)
-Leaderboards add a competitive side of the game
-Satisfying to build up your ""business""
-The store is very cool to window shop in before buying items

Cons:
-Even with an average FPS around 120, the frames drop to 50-60 in town
-Game freezes to load when driving between areas, even though it is an open map

Neutral:
-After some research it appears that the Devs have significantly improved performance over time, As long as they continue to do so. then this is worth $20 and more than worth $10 if you can get 50% off like I did.

Every time i fast travel, or just go fast i end up bugging into a tree and glitching into the ground losing all of my stuff including the trailer.

Most of the time when i use machines to dig, load or carry dirt around, they lose balance quickly then i fall over. 
The exavator, has a issue to where it just gets stuck in dirt, then i have to restart my game, just to get it to fix. 

i have a couple of suggestions for this game just to make it a bit better. 

i would like some new trucks including a cabover so we can carry bigger loads of dirt just like the dump truck can, but a lot more, and you're able to carry vehicles. if its possible, i think a repair shop would be a good idea because if everything breaks on a vehicle, we are able to load it into the cabover's flatbed, and take it to a repair shop to get it fixed, without manually fixing it.

it would be nice if the large trailer was a bit bigger and taller, stuff somewhat attempts to glitch. 

It would be VERY nice, if stuff that we already bought would stay in the trailer and truck, because i'm tired of going back just to get the stuff that i originally had and lose it again. please fix that.


Otherwise, i recommend this game even though its a bit buggy its still good, and its realistic graphics are good, the pyhsics are good, a little buggy but its still good. Good job code horizon!",1579033899,1579033899,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Take gold Mining, a favorite past time of mine, Now shovel endless amounts just to buy the next piece.  

here's what i mean: 

Loadout: large excavator and mobile washplant - takes 12.5 complete hoppers to fill the bucket. large excavator can fill the hopper with 2 dumps. thats 24 dumps into hopper.(if you don't miss) that bucket will net you about 8-10 ounces. lowest piece of equipment around 30k..so thats filling that bucket on washplant at least 4 times. 50 complete hoppers. 100 dumps from excavator.

Large excavator and tier 3 wash plant with dump truck, (about $500k worth of equipment for the complete tier with conveyor)  takes 16.6 dumps from excavator to fill dump truck, dumping that into conveyor and shaker will net you between 12-20 ounces of gold, so 3 dump trucks to buy the same 30k piece of equipment...

not counting the costs of fuel and parcel rent etc etc etc.. oh and fuel OMG! Fuel $10/gallon, haven't seen that in the US since the 1970's!!

Then there's the ""PAY DIRT"" - I didn't just name it that, the developers did.  google pay dirt, it's something you buy that people are selling to see how many suckers there are out there...it's dirt with an exact amount of gold laced into it that is usually worth about half what you paid for it!

According to the developer in one discussion i read, the dirt is layered in 40 layers about 0.5m each layer and gold is laced throughout, if you dig in the center of that layer then dirt should fall...IE dig at layer 20, 20 layers of dirt should fall from above, Not in this world.... lol!! Only a portion falls but the gold that was in it gets deleted. 

So i tried it, got to tier 3(albeit having to rent some of the pieces instead of buying because too expensive) tried the leaderboard...just sucks the life right out, from all the digging. Too much like actual work..

So to the actual Pro's and Con's:

Pro's
The graphics are ok..about the same as an ARMA game. seems the the terrain is the very same from ARMA3, the vehicles run about like arma...if you hit something the wrong way...it goes flying about the very same way.

Some really thought out machinery, even though it's supposedly about ALASKA, but all the machinery is European except the pickup truck. and it seems straight out of an ARMA game lol.

Con's
Good Concept - bad implementation

Graphics still need work especially in the interactions with stuff (fuel nozzle, small shovel for sluice grates...trailers flying off to no where ville and restored to parcel starting point lol)

Some Dev should count the number of times you have to actually do a thing (example given above, 50 hoppers!!!) to be able to upgrade/go to next stage or whatever, and then adjust accordingly.

Gameplay. - it's just NOT fun. TOO much like (excuse me other retiree's) WORK!!!

Buff's - you can hire workers, but apparently they only give buff's to equipment they are assigned to, and usually cost anywhere from $400 - $3000 per day! Donald Trump doesn't even make that much!!! so yes this goes in Con's, hate games that force you to use buff's to advance. Same as games that promote drug usage ""Here eat this painkiller, and you'll be invincible"". lol

Ok so the skinny, I bought it and tried it, and now have it in my library for future. it's kind of fun in the very beginning learning new stuff and what to buy, when to buy, that sort of thing (after numerous restarts). Would i play it again, sure after numerous updates maybe. Would i buy it again if i had it do over, absolutely not.

So recommended at first for those that just want something to do, not recommended for long term, it'll suck the life right out of you with digging.",1578974711,1578974711,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

They are decent 
The gameplay is ok.. it does not have real brands and no real claims like the Beets', Hoffman, Or schnable and i can't spell but what ever
Things sometimes fly to space like if you have a bucket and move it wrong it will fly away. Ps Its a great game other than no brands.",1577652835,1577652835,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Changing settings for video, save, dont save or other.. Maybe. Got the Jack for the truck and put it in the back of the truck. Jack markers still lit in each corner as I drove away.

No quality work on it, just slap dash. Should have been great and simple.. 16Gb ram needed and a shed load of disk space.. Just poor, slap dash and a get it out quick for your cash.

Still dont bother after 2 YEARS!!! What a joke.


Just had enough of this sh17, uninstalling.

update 2 : another update has gone out and stuffed it up again... What is the point, is there any testing done on updates before throwing crap code out at people who paid money for this crap.

UPDATE : They have taken notice (lots of people were mad) of removing all funds for the second season in the game and allowed a ""One Time"" offer to get your money back from the first season. Well at least that is something... yah ok.

Another update. Not worth what you pay, having to start again with the same $H!T bugs in, save your money, 80+ hours hoping that they would produce something good (wont get that back), what a joke.

Latest update isnt worth it, just made the game worse. Yup it took out some stuff that made the game ok but now.... Fire the developers.

Good idea for a game but there have been several updates now and the Dozer / Front Loader / diggers can get stuck on a small pile of pay dirt. You have to reset them in order to get them back working or spend a while trying to get them out of a small hole. It is all well and good adding new features but until the physics is right....

To clear the small mounds of dirt out the way you have to use one of the diggers to scrape the pay dirt up :) ( the dozer didn't work )

I am going to base my review on the following criteria and score each item of the game out of 100.

1. Game entertainment value.
2. Graphics & realism - The feel and look of the game and how realistic the game is.
3. Functionality of the equipment used in the game.
4. Difficulty level - How easy is the game to use.
5.Pricing of the game - Price of the game and DLC packs.
6. Interactive game play. - How interactive is the game playable with others.
7. Stability of the game. How stable does the game run.
8. Updates and upgrades. How often does the game get updates and upgrades.
9. Creativity interaction -  Players ability to be creative and contribute towards the game and be interaction with the game -  Workshop items.
10 General feedback -  Feed back from both the Dev's and players.

After playing the game since it started back in Oct of 2017 in 2 years of the games release. I have over 1240 hours of playing the game to give a review of how the game has progressed.  

The game has both good and bad  points in each category so I am going to give my review based on the fact that this game is targeting players from all ages young and old. I will give the scores as we review each point.

1. Starting off with the gaming entertainment value , the game has great potential to keep players captivated and entertained, however the lack of progress and development is sadly holding the game back, I will explain in more detail below..  
In the 2 years of the games existence the dev's worked very hard to develop the parts sections and the ability for parts to break down and be replaced by the players, which it adds great value to the game and keeps the players rather busy. So we all grateful for the efforts.

Sadly to report the game has not progressed much further than that given the fact that in the 2 years, we still have the same old slow sluggish front end loader and bulldozer that barely moves dirt around. On the Old Arnolds claim were the terrain is relatively flat the 2 machines just about manage. On the more challenging claims were there are steeper terrain to clime in and out of is where the 2 machines really struggle leaving playing the game rather frustrating. SCORE - 45%

2. The graphics & realism
The graphics of the game is relatively mediocre , whilst the vehicles and equipment gives you the really old equipment feel
the realism is lacking a lot, E.G Using the equipment in the claim there is no dust or dirt on the vehicles being used and the pay dirt is not realistic at all. When digging up the dirt it forms odd clumps or ball shapes that is not the way pay dirt looks in real life.  Other games like Farmsim have better graphics that gives the game and the vehicles a more realistic look and feel.  The graphics for Gold Rush is very out dated and very 1990's type of graphics.
With today's modern PC and gaming platforms and OS systems on the market Gold Rush developers have yet to show us any  improvement  on the graphics to enhance the game to the next level,. As far as realism goes processed pay dirt is far from the reality, there is no overburden to deal with or water ponds in the game, SCORE - 30%

3. Functionality of the game and equipment.
The functionality of the game in general is not bad , keeping in mind that all ages are playing the game so young kids would be able manage to fit parts on the machines. The game does have faults though, as mentioned earlier lack of power on some of the equipment does make the functionality challenging and mostly frustrating. Improvement and more development in this department would make a huge difference in the game. The tipper truck works well and Frankenstein does have glitches sliding around on uneven terrain and slopes when parked.  The game desperately needs improved and newer equipment with more power., players are begging for more. SCORE - 45%

4. Difficulty level
With the Dev's spending a lot of effort in this side of the game giving players a choice of setting the level of difficulty with the toggling on and off of the various scenarios of machines ability to break down and the management of the funds, as well as the leadership board competition side, it has given the players freedom of choice. SCORE - 70%
5.Pricing of the game and DLC. 
Given the fact that the game is out for over 2 years now, I think the pricing of the game is fair, taking into consideration  that the Dev's gave us a free upgrade in the beginning of the game with the drill the DLC of the Frakenstein did spark some outcry from the players, personally I think the DLC was fairly priced and much needed. Are we going to see more DLC in the future is the question now? SCORE - 70%
6. Interactive game play.
Apart from the leader board competition there is sadly no interactive game play between players ( Multiplayer) and the Dev's have made a very stubborn decision that there will not be multiplayer in the future either. This has a big negative impact on the players as many would like to team up and be able to work the claims in various equipment together. Other games have worked in multiplayer into their games with great success. 
Whilst working in the claim and not having the ability to assign a vehicle to a driver be it multiplayer or a driver within the game  and actually see the tipper truck E.G being driven by an assigned player / worker is also disappointing to say the least. The game does have workers in the background doing repairs and various tasks but not actually seeing them conduct the work been done is a letdown. SCORE 0%
7. Stability of the game.
Like any new game in the beginning Gold Rush  was also plagued with many bugs and issues which sparked off outcry from frustrated players.  The Dev's worked hard to try and iron out most of the bugs however there are still a few longstanding bugs within the game. Like buckets sticking to trailers and sluices. Buckets and objects that go flying off trailers being unhitched from the truck. Vehicle sounds not working correctly or not working at all from time to time, 
Driver sticking half outside of the vehicle and parts that gets stuck.  Game stability has improved slightly better, we not seeing as many game crashes to file, The frame rate still needs loads of work done, even with a modern very high powered PC and latest graphics card  the game still shows issues in the frame rate, this could be due to the low end  out dated graphics design of the game. SCORE 50%
8. Updates and up grades.
Dev's have spent a lot of time and effort working on the leader board development and have sent out patches and fixes. Latest word is they are busy working on the controller support for other platforms other than PC. We hope that the Dev's will return to the game and start to improve and address on some of the above mentioned issues and actually paying attention to the needs of the players.
9. Creativity
The ability and need for players, designers and even game developers working together to help improve the game would be so much more beneficial to the game if only the dev's would allow more interactive and creative ideas come to fruition. 
Unfortunately this game is very guarded by the dev's and they are very reluctant to share any  development tools out and allow others to work on projects like in steam workshop. Games like Planet coaster and Zoo, Xplane 11, Flightsim X just to mention a few have all successfully introduced the ability for player interaction and contributions, boosting their games to the next level.  SCORE 10%
10. General feed back
Looking at the community board and discussions between Dev's and players speaks volumes, One can only say that the dialog between player and Dev's would help game improvement if only the Dev's would give more frequent feedback and be more receiptable to ideas and suggestions from players and attend to what the players would like to see within the game. SCORE 30%  This is my view of the game, you decide.

TL;DR:  Don't waste your money, get another game! :-)

Firstly, the controls at start up are ridiculous, I use a controller and when I push my left stick 'forward' (usually for down) the implement your using goes the opposite, up.  This is for all directions and implements.  Yes you can change the settings, by why should you, this should be set up 'out of the box'.

Next, when interacting with something, you either have to align your crosshair EXACTLY (within millimetres) to use/interact with the item (or lower your DPI/sensitivity) and if that doesn't work, you have to try and align the 'outline' with whatever implement currently equipped, once again, you have to be within a poofteenth of a millimetre to make it work and have to be standing at the 'correct' side or otherwise you'll just be 'waving' the bucket/shovel/tool/implement around in the air.

Auto-save.  Go make a coffee and come back, it dumps your FPS and at times freezes all movement whilst it's doing it's thing.  

And talking of FPS dumps/freezes, everytime you move at a 'fast' pace, when you enter the next 'cell' it lags/freezes as it loads the environment.  Don't get me wrong, the scenery and the detail put into it is excellent, however, it's all at the cost of FPS rate and otherwise playability.  The 'devs' (and I use that term loosely) spent more time on the scenery than coding the working and implementation of controls and it shows.

NO MODS!  Why you ask?  After having read the reviews (too late (yes I'm an idiot), I bought the game because I like the show on TV) it seems to me that the 'devs' (again this term is loosely used) are either too frightened or too ashamed to let modders (and others) see the crappy code work that has gone into this 'game' and don't want to be 'shown up' by 'amateurs' (I extensively use mods and as far as I can see/tell, most modders are way beyond being amateurs) and have it 'released/revealed' that the overall coding is crapola and seems to have been 'smashed' together by 'amateurs'.....

So, once again, in a nutshell, go elsewhere with your money, here it's only wasted.

Cheers

Well, decided to try this without using a controller and it's marginally better, completely useless when trying to drive a vehicle as you have no throttle control.  Also when driving, automatically shifts into reverse when applying brake and you come to a stop (on a dime I must say) and starts 'zooming' in reverse straightaway.  Easy fix would be you need to 'release' button/stick and reapply in the direction you wish to go.

One thing that I am starting to hate is that when you pick something up and need to go across your claim with it, it is placed about 6 inches from in front of your face, making you completely 'blind' as you can NOT SEE WHERE YOU ARE GOING!!!!  When you pick up an object, why not have it 40% lower so that you can see the top of it and it would not completely obstruct your vision, but let me guess, this is also too hard to 'change the code' (in normal speak ""we have no idea what we're really doing"").

So, again, don't waste your money, spend it elsewhere where the dev team actually has clue about their own coding.

It seemed like there was a lot of potential to be fun, but I found the controls for digging to be really janky and I couldn't get very far. On top of that, no matter what I did, the dirt would not land in the back of the truck. Even with the helpful glowing yellow reticle on the ground to guide you, all the dirt still made a pile *underneath* the truck. Jesus Tapdancing Christ.

So only after about 15-20 minutes of 'gameplay' I was completely exasperated and threw in the towel. I won't be asking for a refund because the game wasn't that bad and I hope that the small amount of money I spent go toward game improvements. 

If you enjoy grindy, meticulous games: you may enjoy this. It doesn't seem like a bad game, it just takes a lot of brain space to stay on top of everything and that is not something that is relaxing or fun for me. 

If you don't like grindy, meticulous games: save your money.

I have 400 hours played in between 17 and 19 and was looking for something to fill that void. This game fit perfectly. The process of slowly building your claim up from hand digging to large machinery is very rewarding and then improving your wash plant and eventually buying more claims to work on. That rewarding feeling is what keeps bringing me back. Totally cleaning out one claim and moving your whole operation to another is something that takes a lot of work but when you are done feels really great. I would fully recommend this game and also recommend the dlc packs that are avaliable as they add meaningful content to the game.

With that being said I do have a few things on my wishlist for this game.
1) Multiplayer, how cool would it be to run an excavator with your friends lined up in dump trucks ready to fill, or processing concentrate while others are digging for more pay dirt.
2) Mod support. I have been digging in mostly the same manner for the last 100 hours or more and mods could add different machines that make it feel fresh or different in some way.
3) More machinery/wash plant/claim options. I know the developers are adding more options through dlc at a semi regular pace but I would like to see so much more.

I like the fact i can start the game, and basically turn my mind off for a period of time while i dig, dump, process, repeat. Which leads to the not so good.... dig, dump, process, repeat, and repeat, and repeat.  I've gotten to the point in the game where money isn't an issue. ( Not cheating, persay.) I did have the ""everything is 1$ option turned on, and while it make the initial stage a bit less stressful, it also can ruin some of the challenge.  
  Using the SAME equipment, the Same setup, the same procedure at each claim gets old the longer the game is played. The occasional breakdown breaks up the grind, but only slightly, as repairs are a royal PITA.  Each ""season"" seems to run into the next the longer the game is played. 
  Some Would be Nice item: Obviously new/different equipment would be WONDERFUL to bring new life into the game. Also, improving the Dozer, and even the Excavator would be great too. Being able to purchase different buckets, or even a bigger excavator. Adding a claim that give the ability to customize the setup of the processing plant would be FANTASTIC! 
   Lastly, while multi-player is not likely, this game has a TON of multi-player potential, and would absolutely benefit from it. 
   In summation, I recommend this game to those who require the ability to quickly save/pause a game to run after a child, or perform a ""Honey Do"" task.  Is it perfect? No. Is it horrible?

BUGS:
I do recommend this game to anyone who is into the Tv Series, or if you like games were you need to grind BUT. The game has this one bug in particular that drives me insane, where if you so happen to rub against an object you stick to it and have to back off and try again. Sometimes the object will even stick out and grab you a second time. Super big pain in my a** and needs to be fixed.

MULTIPLAYER:
This game is honestly fun for the first day. the second day it actually begins to feel super lonely. There is no AI encounters to keep you company and I have read many forums from the developers saying ""They will never add multiplayer"" even though the entire gaming community around the game has been begging for it. In my opinion the developers are super lazy and don't truely care about customer satisfaction. Multiplayer isn't that hard to implement, and they claimed that it would be hard to have two computers showing off the soft physics and all this BS... BUT Spintires did it no problem. Spin tires with less game creating experience then Gold rush has. the company who made gold rush made other games {I think} without Multiplayer and yet Spintires has multiplayer within the first year.

I wouldn't recommend this game and here is why and what i think would make it recommendable.

The major thing with this game is you have to do everything yourself ( solo mining ), even if you employ workers you still have to physically do all the mining.
This is dig the soil , fill the dumper , drive the dumper and tip it , take out all the moss and clean it , make sure your equipment is repaired and has fuel, basically do every little job all by yourself.
Even farming sim has helpers that will do some of the jobs for you so i can't see why this game has none of it.

You can own / lease 1 or 10 claims its your choice but with the workers only giving you little buffs instead of doing jobs for you there is no point in owning or lease more than 1 claim.

The game gets boring very fast simply because of the amount of work you have to do for little reward.

If you like real grinding games and all you play for is to grind doing the same thing over and over again then this game is for you.

What would make this game better imo.

Workers actually do some jobs which would leave you free to do other jobs, for example if  a worker is assigned to the excavator then that worker will do the digging for you ( mark an area for them to dig and away they go, would only dig if a dumper is close enough for them to fill ).

Workers could have more than 1 skill so you could assign them to another job.

here is a list of jobs workers i think could do without being impossible.

Excavator : Worker digs an area marked out by the player , Worker only digs when a dumper is close enough for them to fill, one dumper is filled worker stops until a dumper with some space to fill is returned.

Sluice : once a sluice is full worker shuts down the plant to remove the moss from the sluices , For the worker to do this you will need some sort of container that will hold all the mats close to the sluices. Once you have taken the moss away and cleaned and returned them back to the spot, the worker replaces the mats and fires the plant back up.

Bulldozer : same as Excavator the player marks an area which they want stripping or ripping.

These are just 3 jobs i feel workers could do without causing to many problems in the game.
The more experienced the worker the faster they do the job.

If the workers are not going to do the work then Multiplayer is a must where players can have friends or other players doing a co-op.

would i have recommended this game if there was some way of getting help on your claim.

They have some transport boxes you can put things in so you don't need to walk for every single piece but it seems that they forgot to add weight to things because half the stuff tends to fall out so you have to pick it up again.
I got the big bucket from the tent, put the pan inside, lifted the bucket, pan went flying.
