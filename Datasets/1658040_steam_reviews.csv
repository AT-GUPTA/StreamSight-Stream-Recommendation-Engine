the game gets less polished as you get closer to the end of current content, and its clear that a lot of things have placeholders for future upgrades. 

the plot is that a seagull woke you from cryosleep by accident, you have amnesia and a cybernetic right hand. most of the progression focuses on cybernetic upgrades via saw and hammer. mostly you focus on farming, so you wont starve in the early game. the fishing is okay, but the process of gathering and boiling water so you can water crops is a bit of a chore. completing the bridge gets you to the current endgame area. you need to keep upgrading buildings, in order to get better resources to get the next set of stuff made.

I love games that add unlockable customization and let you change your character whenever you like, a really big plus. The art is pleasant and there's still a small amount of strife to worry about, but nothing that's a deal breaker.

If I had one gripe it's the food meter. I understand the need to eat in survival games, but I do spend a lot of time feeding my character which can be very time consuming. If there was a way to get a bigger boon while eating cooked food that slowed the meter, or perhaps a way to set it slower or off in the options that would nice. Either way that would be great.

It lags quite a bit progression-wise. Water pumps and batteries honestly take a long time to get to compared to how everything else goes.
 And now I'm in the end game of creating foam which honestly is really boring. I'm making resources and clearing space to have multiple printers because it takes an in game hour to make 8 of these things. Which is like two full in game days which is like what 30 minutes? I don't actually know. But it takes a really long time and there's not much to do in the down-time other than protect your crops from worms because the holy hammer or whatever it's called its like the last thing you can get apart from the upgraded fishing pole. 

There's a lot of stuff where I don't get why they even show you the preview. I feel like it was simple enough to already have implemented by now. But then I assume when this game came out it was so bare bones that it was the most milquetoast and empty game. Unless of course it wasn't, and it's development is just really f*ckin slow. 

Yeah sure the game is ""cozy"" but that game is also boring because of how limited your options are. I was listening to John Mulaney standup while playing. I don't think you need 3 indicators for what time of day it is. Well actually it's four. You have the clock, the gradient bar, you have the shadows moving with the sky, and you have the annoying pop-up telling you it's morning or night despite the fact you could already tell based on what color the screen currently is. 

There's still a handful of bugs, like not being able to carry more than one plank or sheet despite having both upgrades gloves and strength perk from eating recently and being full. As well as planks and sheets getting stuck in your hands so you permanently have a plank of wood stuck in your character's hands as they do other stuff. 

The bot minions also don't work. If they do, they're very selective when they decide to work. They will not build constuctions or maintain buildings even when they are assgined to do so.
The only one that kind of works is gathering and putting materials away.
And even then, they refuse to pick up anything other than wood and slime. They were picking up fiber glass and sheet metal for a bit but then they stopped for some reason and then just idled and then ran out of battery and then went to recharge. 

You can clearly see all the areas that are still in progress and it's the most infuriating thing because I see a bunch of resources I cannot access. Which thankfull they have a transmute system to turn plant fiber into plastic and metal otherwise this game would be impossible or slow to a crawl. Because I definitely ran out of plastic at one point and spent ages fishing with no bait just to get plastic from trash drops. Which I don't frankly understand where all these microprocessors are coming from and are still functional despite being bathed in sea water which both corrodes and corrupts electronics.

First... This is just a MOBILE GAME. The games on mobile are not as good as this, but it is not significantly better and that just makes the time I have spent underwhelming.

I like this game, especially the story concept, and that’s why I spent the money despite there being many similar playstyles for free on mobile.

If there are major updates to the game then I will definitely buy it again, but right now I’m going to apply for a refund before my 2h are up…

NECESSARY UPDATES :
1)	Are ALL engineers men???
2)	Are all engineers ppl with BLOND hair and BLUE eyes???
3)	There are some bugs with adding headphones (I like music so thanks for adding that touch)

X) Something… I love this cozy game and would have liked to play longer and see where the story leads for myself, but if the character is not more customisable then I need to stop hear and see what the developers do…
This is my first ever steam review since I got this account, this is how much I like the game, so it would be sad if some basic things are not improved. Just don't think it's ready to play just yet.",1691678918,1707524825,True,0,0,0.369458228349685669,0,True,False,True

Pros
- The music is quite relaxing
- The aesthetic is well done, nothing is included that feels like it doesn't belong
- Fun method of discovering food combos.
- Fishing is actually enjoyable
- Crafting is very satisfying

Cons
- There are only two primary music tracks
- There are limited uses for minions even fully upgraded.
- The water collection/purification/drinking system is quite lengthy and unable to be automated by minions
- filling sprinklers is unable to be automated by minions
- Minions can be told to build things, and to put fuel in your power plant, but can't be told to auto-manufacture things
- There are a few bugs that while not gamebreaking, just mainly visual things.

Bottom line. I Am Future is a cozy early access game with plenty of charm and promise. The story is engaging and is supported by the aesthetic, and the gameplay is fun. There are alot of options for the developer in the future to build on in terms of gameplay features, locations, activities, and so on.",1707306543,1707306543,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Have you ever wanted to play a survival game that didn't feel so gloom and doom?  Well, you've found it!  This turned out to be such a neat little game.  I loved the art style, and the bright cheerful look of the world even though everything has clearly gone to ----.  

The mellow music made me feel like I was perpetually living my best lazy Sunday afternoon, coffee in hand, warm socks hugging my feet.. etc.  This game felt like a breath of fresh air compared to many survival games who's aesthetic is very grim, dark, and gritty.  It feels like the end of the world, but from the eyes of a person who's still got a little hope that there will be a better future ahead.  

Here's what I loved about the game:

Music and visuals were great
Cheerful in the face of hard times
Fishing 
Disassembling parts felt satisfying
Smart storage ( you can link boxes eventually have have them auto fill)
Helper buddies
Beautiful art style
Easy to loose real life hours.
Eager to play more.

Wish list for future updates:

Boxes need more slots
Stacks could go higher
Pin multiple recipes at once
Farmer minion
WASD to move map
Ability to move all plants even the edible ones
DIY fertilizer
Better farming

[h2] Nice game, but... [/h2]
My first experience with the game was wonderful. It has beautiful art and an interesting setting. There are amazing mechanics which allow the use of different types of interaction to gather resources. 
But after the second game session, it became boring. You don't have any obvious long-term goals. They are at the start of the game but it is easy to forget about them. And after 4 hours of playing, you lose any motivation to do anything because you can not understand why.
Also, the man's character is amazing, but the woman... brah it is really strange and I think she can be more stylish 

By the way, core mechanics are great and if developers polish the meta and give smoother progression in the story, there will be all chances for ""I Am Future: Cozy Apocalypse Survival"" to become a super game.

That piqued my interest because the elements of survival and cozy aren't usually congruous, and to some extent, I think I was right. The enemies to a degree are rather pressuring if you don't know what you are doing. My pro tip for noobs is once you have unlocked the area with the smart tower, move all your gardens up there. It is not worth it trying to fight off the leech plants until later when you are thinking about tidying up the map as best as you can. The mechanics around getting materials are fun, if basic, and that is a good thing because the game gives you a gigantic clutter and says ""have fun and don't forget to unlock tools!"" It is all the fun of clearing out your farm in Stardew Valley but stretched out across the entire game. One of the great elements of it is that tools naturally unlock different regions yes, but they also unlock your traversal through already explored regions too. At first you are clawing your way through the walls and fences that surround you, and then you get to smart tower tier 2 and all of that just poofs away as you can effectively walk anywhere there is ground.


Edit: One con I missed that I hope does get fixed too: the Chest management system. I think that the chests are one of the weaker parts of this game, which is a hard line to say in a survival crafter with limited inventory like most of them. There is very little about the chests I would qualify as wholly good. You have a take items button, but not an ""add to existing stacks"" button, that would make inventory cleaning 10x more easier (in a way that adds to the game instead of subtracts.)

Automatons are also slow on the uptick when it comes to new or existing storages. When they add stuff to chests, they don't bother to think what is inside the chest or how that might be relevant, so a lot of the time you spend is spent reorging your chests for the 11th time as your leeches chest is still not getting the leech related materials. A filter setting for chests would be nice, or you could go full into that chest meta technology and have it so that when a carrier brings an item to any chest, it prioritizes stacks across all of the chests.
Love the idea of big items that cannot fit in chests, but lets walk through something, can we? For wood, you have the plank storage. Great, if a little disappointed that there were no upgrades for it. Then you move to sheet metal, and you have metal storage, makes sense, same approval. Then you move to the third big resource, Plexiglass. I am willing to look past the lack of creating it from raw materials because by the point in the game you get them you are probably closing in on daily plexiglass trades. But where is it stored? Nowhere! None of the storages accept it and I have this towering stack of it in my base.

I don't think that making storage easier is necessarily a bad thing. I don't know how many people play base management games to fret over where everything goes.


Cons of the game:
No permanent way to deal with the leeches. It makes sense from a standpoint of needing bait materials and the corrosive stuff for solvents, but the amount of solvent we need in the late game is next to none. 
-Automation is basically postgame content as you will either struggle to get anything done or unlock things as demands for materials ramp.
-At the time of posting this, have completed all of the content available. Worth a weekend for sure, but some things are definitely hamstringed by the Early Access.
-Twist is rather common, and that is OK, /spoiler but what isn't is that the NPC's just accept this with no evidence provided. I hope that the story's strife becomes a bit more robust.
-Fishing minigame needs an option to set it to faster mode. It increases the difficulty, but increases the rate at which you could catch fish.

Overall, I would give this game as it stands today a 7/10, where 5 is a Good game, 7 is worth it, 9 is exemplar, and 10 is reserved for games I think should go down in history. This game isn't a C-, no this is a solid B. I want to give room for it to rise to a 9 when the game develops and takes the anchors off our feet.

Edit: As of the most recent update, I am updating my score to a 7.5. It fixed a couple of the major things I had, but I am still waiting to give it an 8 as the story develops.",1691675146,1704878169,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,True

 The camera is a bit clunky. There is no plot.  None.  There is a post apocalyptic roof top but no plot and no goals beyond building new machines from old machines. There isn't even a mystery.  You find out pretty fast what happened to the world. The entire game is breaking down junk for parts and building new things. You never physically leave the same little area you start out on.  I think it wants to be like Raft but on a rooftop but misses the mystery, exploration, and danger of Raft.  Breaking down the stuff got repetitive and boring fast, trying to figure out how to get certain parts was frustrating and without google I would have been lost. Also, the base building aspect of the game is very limited. I've clocked in 17 hours (most of which was me forgetting to turn off game when I went to work) and I'm done with all the content. If you enjoy repetitive mindless busy work of breaking down stuff than this is the game for you.  It's early access and there is a lot of potential. It all depends on how much the devs decide to put into it.  But as is it feels like the skeleton of an idea of a game.",1704812102,1704812102,False,5,0,0.526122450828552246,0,True,False,True

I think that mini game with fishing in this game realized more convenient than in others. However, when you have 80 worms this process becomes extremely slow and annoying. 
Very like to disassemble items, I think it's a very good idea!

And now about the minuses. 

- Disbalance in the amount of resources. Some types of resources just too many(worms, iron, that blue thing), and others at a certain stage, becomes in a pinch (plastic, compost). 
- I wildly hate this endless process of creating plastic and glass bottles. A glass bottle is needed for almost every quality recipe, you need a lot of them, and their recipe is too complicated (not to mention the fact that you still need to create other dishes) As a result, I have accumulated a lot of ingredients that without this bottle are useless.
- Minions are stupid and useless
- Again, fishing becomes very annoying when you have accumulated like 80 worms.
- Sprinkler works only when it full with water. Otherwise, you have to water the garden yourself. However, even if filled, it is still useless. The lack of automated watering irritates me quite a lot.

Sooo I'm really looking forward to new updates and new content and I VERY MUCH HOPE that the process of sterilizing water and the creation of these fucking glass bottles can be maximally automated or it will be redone and simplified.",1704559674,1704559674,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

However, this game is honestly more stressful than most other 'cozy' farming games. Yes, there is no time limit, but the game is full of clutter and waste. There is no way to clear off the trash and 'clean' the area without littering the world with trash you don't need to use, and mid-game reagents are just too troublesome and cumbersome to gather. Categorization is a nightmare, and there are certain decisions that go against the coziness factor of the idea, such as pointless busywork minigames that add nothing except waste time, and inventory that is incredibly messy and has limited stacks. There are certain things that can't even be stored properly that drop from everything, which means clearing messes makes more mess. There is also a hunger and health factor that is, again, antithesis to a 'coziness' factor. This game is unbalanced and stressful, and the devs have decided, across the last half year, not to listen to any input from anyone and decide to work on completely pointless things like adding more visuals and cosmetics when the game itself is not even complete.

Edit:
I appreciate the developer for responding. I am happy at least that they are listening to feedback. However, I feel that the priorities are a little skewed. The game released in August, and I bought it day one. It took 5 months to release a new gender model, and people have been complaining about the fishing minigame SINCE day one. I would know. I was there. No one was complaining that there was no 2nd gender model. Does it take that long to remove a minigame? In addition, I am aware of the coziness slider. But that is again, a reflection of the mentality of the game to me. Rather than allowing you to turn it off entirely, the game patches it up by still having the meters run. It's visual clutter. And you can't turn off damage entirely, so it's not a 100% coziness option, it's just a partial one.

What I'm saying is that things need to be fixed at its core, and not just things on the surface. Devs, if you read this, I actually think that this is a fun game, but I feel that there's a lot of prettiness on the surface hiding a lot of longer-term problems under the hood. I genuinely hope that you mean it that all the areas will be covered, and covered properly. I would love to play this game with good balance and the ability to make everything actually clean and neat and repaired, perhaps. I will come back to this game to give it another chance when things improve, and I will change my review accordingly as needed.",1704043869,1704552231,False,2,0,0.48883664608001709,0,True,False,True

Things I'd like to see improved:
- make higher tier food better and worth the hassle
- improve the Bot AI, they are trash /pathing issues, stuck, idle ect.) and make them more useful /farming, fishing, water gathering / desalting)
- make tool upgrades more impactful (reduce/improve/speed up the mini games with better tools so gathering low tier stuff is less of a hassle)
- traders could use a ""daily random item sales"" system, so there is more reason to revistit them (give us a crafted mailbox to view the daily offerings)
- improve performance, loading screes take to long and get really annoying when fetching water in the early game. Also at some point the game just begs you to do a restart when you get lagg spikes when dealing with the corruption spread",1704033961,1704033961,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

Game brings more suffering than actual enjoyment.

1. If you won't learn/understand farming mechanics, you will suffer. You understood it, great, later you will have enough food, just by gathering (much faster), so you can forget about it.
2. Game restricts you from what you want to do. You want to build a base - not enough resources and space. To get resources, you need better tools, to free building space, you need better tools. To have better tools, you have to progress in game story. You want farming - not enough resources, which you can get only by progressing in game story and they are limited. You want to build a bridge - same restrictions. Etc. - same restrictions.
3. You want to progress in game story - try to guess what you will need to upgrade. And before upgrading it try to guess what you need to upgrade extra, or where you can find needed limited resource. And you better hope that you didn't wasted limited resource to something else, like extra same building to increase crafting process. Else you will have to suffer more. Too much different building to craft different things, Due to amount of buildings and independent upgrade per each building, you have to check each building for building upgrade availability to be able progress in game further.
3. Game has currency, which you only get for the achievements. This means that later game developers might add shop for real money - I am not big fan of such mechanics in single player games, for which I already payed.

Game brings more suffering than actual enjoyment.

Ways for developers how to improve game play experience without major game changes:
1. Put all building upgrades in one place, not each building independently. Same as it was done with tools upgrade.
2. Increase inventory slot storage per item limit. So there won't be need to build many chests, just to store no longer needed/trash resources.
3. Think about ways to give players to choose what they want to do instead of forcing them to progress in game story.",1703949057,1704017048,False,2,0,0.5,0,True,True,True

Item cannot be disassembled? Go upgrade your tools, oh you need X to upgrade, go find it or buy it. The tool upgrades is kind of linear, once you upgrade one, you get to disassemble a bunch more that would lead you to other stuff. The expedition is kinda meh, it is a glorified shop as well as a repeatable source of materials albeit it only gives a few. The game itself and the concept is cozy and chill, but for such a simple game, it's kinda heavy on the graphics with random fps drops even on parts of the game that should seem simple enough such as going on expedition.

I kept getting The Sims in the post-apocalypse vibes from the trailer, and then the hot tub showed up and cemented it. And then I kept watching and thinking, like, “Oh no, this is nothing like The Sims,” but then I just realized that it’s a lot like post-apocalypse The Sims if you took away all the other Sims and let them travel around scavenging.

So, in I Am Future, you play as Chris, potentially the only human left on Earth. And they seem kind of all right with that. I don’t blame them. Their goal is not only to survive but also to search for other survivors and try to unravel the mystery of why the world ended. You explore the sunken city, tear things apart for building materials, and build up your base of operations. You can even build robots to help you with all your chores.

I Am Future launched into Early Access with “a part” of the main story. The goal for the team is to add new features, areas to explore, and story content over time. They state that they don’t want to keep it “in Early Access for too long,” but are unwilling to give a more detailed estimate on how long they expect it to last.

You start your singular mission on rather simple terms, and mostly, you’ll need to gather supplies and get yourself a little base setup. This is made incredibly easy as the rooftop is littered with all sorts of materials you can salvage and repurpose for your own needs. Luckily, the tutorial will also guide you through a few basics, such as walking around, keeping an eye on your health and hunger, salvaging and more as the need arises.

As mentioned before, you’ll need to salvage and collect everything you need. However, you’ll need a few tools. Luckily, your first tool is your Cybernetic Hand that connects to your character’s prosthesis. Your prosthesis is your most important tool because of how versatile it becomes and what it gives you access to. Though your first tool is the Cybernetic Hand, it’ll give you a decent strength boost and allow you to carry heavy objects like wooden planks, metal sheets, the usual things you can’t exactly carry in your inventory because of their size.

Shortly after getting your nifty new hand, you’ll probably also discover the Suitcase. For those who like to customize their characters, this is the place to be. Unfortunately, it’s not a full-scale character creator, and you’ll be quite limited on clothing options, expanding your options is relatively easy though. Some of the clothing options can be unlocked through the Eco-Vending machines, and others you’ll find through expeditions and lockboxes. You’ll be pleasantly surprised at how quickly your wardrobe can grow after spending some time cleaning up the rooftop.

I Am Future doesn’t quite play the rules on the visual front for a survival game, keeping in mind that the game has to be cozy as well, it relies heavily on a simple but not quite low poly design. You’ll see that the world and everything you can interact with is designed to be soft on the eyes while maintaining a nice flow between colors. While there isn’t much detail in animation, the environmental objects like trees and grass will still wave in the wind which adds a nice touch. The use of outlines around anything you interact with can be a bit distracting sometimes and does make things a bit confusing with how densely packed the rooftop already is.

With regards to music and sound engineering, I Am Future really captured the meaning of comfortable and cozy. Between the day and night shifts, each one has its own unique soundtrack for background music that really gives a new layer of life to the game as a whole. Unfortunately, there is a little voice acting for your character, but only during the initial cinematic. The rest of the time, it’ll be a quick and repetitive ‘yay’ while fishing or a grunt while getting hurt. The androids you talk to rely on scratchy and muffled buzzing noises when they talk, having I Am Future fully voiced would make things a bit more interesting instead of just getting a yay.

Overall, I Am Future is literally the embodiment of cozy survival down to its core. It’s the type of game that you’ll find yourself losing hours to without even realizing it; the occasional bug might be annoying but it’s not enough of a hindrance to stop the fun. The only sad thing about I Am Future is how short-lived the current content in the game is, though we can only hope that more will be added in future updates.

Disassembling things, especially the larger appliances is really cool, and the recipes are fun, despite being pretty limited at the moment.

I haven't played long enough to know if the complaints about slow game development are true, but the Christmas update shows the game is still getting some love, and the changes were good, so take Early Access as you will.

UPDATE @ 16HRS:  It's actually REALLY FUN and has a very well done progression system.  It keeps you engaged and coming back for more, definitely not difficult, but not too easy either. Turns into much more of a supply management/efficient station placement game, but it's all at your own personal choice of design efficiency.The game expands in a rewarding way, and things have unfolded past where I expected an EA game i got on sale for less than $10.

now, the gripe it jitters at night as there is so much happening with the growth its kinda annoying i play on a top spec pc and it does have a few jitters, but a restart every now and then makes this clear up thinks it has a little bit of a memory leak. 

its not really long enough i played this for 14 hours but at least 6-7 of them i was afk "" Kids "" and a good few hours just making the place look good, so i would say 3 hours of play will finish the current game if your not speed running. needs more content and soon really. 

On the good side this game has a potential to be amazing apart from the jitters every now and then its really good polished game and is very addictive. just hope they don't take ages to release the rest as im very interested to see where they go with this. they have clearly spent a lot of time and money making what is there and im glad they have put the time into making what is there good as most companies now on steam just release a broken half baked game. 

Its very playable the only bug i found was when i built the bridge across i got stuck on the docks and had to re-spawn but this bug was sorted due to the re-spawn button so they had a fail safe they have covered most angles! i really do appreciate a companies that releases the game playable and fun. keep up the good work and pump us some content out.

While you will be constantly managing hunger and time, there's no heavy punishment as most resources aren't destroyed or they can respawn or be found indefinitively, but you'll be so busy managing quests and projects and optimizing everything, there's rarely a dull moment - at least as long as you don't run out of meaningful content, which is to be expected of early access, but I'm quite a few hours in and haven't done everything yet - all while basking in the beautifully overrun and lush post apoc- world.
The visual style is honestly amazing, vibrant with colors and in a greatly rendered cartoon-ish style , and I was impressed with the huge number of clothing slots, all playing along nicely, for your character customization : multiple layers for coat,shirt, pants, accessories, boots and even socks, and tbh it's even fun to switch up outfits for various tasks and storytelling as you run around ragged to try and do everything.
Also kudos for finally having a fishing mechanic that doesn't make me mad for being random and unnecessarily complicated, but only being a matter of simple skills and the right equipment.
On the flip side, the handling of electrosites, harmful pests whose job is ruin your nights, wasn't as good, as removing infected plants and leeches leaves an untold number of non disappearing items on the floor that will eventually bog down your frames, so you have to constantly play janitor and clean useless items up and drop them elsewhere, without any way so far to control or remove their source, or plainly get rid of them. 
Also the music, while nice and relaxing, could really use some variety as it gets bothersome after a few hours.
 Moreso, the time moves way too fast in a single day with the dreaded 1 minute = 1 second equivalence, items per stack are too few, the storage for workbenches and similar should be bigger or upgradable, and the robotic minions are absolutely useless and pretty much bugged, either getting stuck and running out of battery, or they just stuff everything they find in any chest despite being told to do otherwise.
All of these things I find annoying can and will likely be solved with a few extra updates, and I'm eager to see what they're gonna add next!

Instead of harsh survival in a ruined world, the game is a very casual time killer. It's strange that the game isn't available on mobile platforms, it would look good there.
Unfortunately, the game is at the very beginning of production. There is not enough content, there is not much plot, some of the mechanics do not work or work with bugs. It feels like the game is only 15-20% complete, at best. However, I liked the game. It feels like it was made with love and knowledge of their craft. There is potential for further development. You can relax for a couple of evenings and enjoy simple gameplay. But you'll have to wait a very, very long time for the entire game.

I Am Future is surprisingly polished in its early access state with very few bugs, but definitely room for improvement and plenty of opportunity to extend gameplay by just adjusting existing mechanics. About 12 hours of gameplay.

[list]
[*] PROGRESSION & BALANCE: My biggest critique is that the game felt a little too fast. I felt I was progressing a little too fast and unlocking a lot, quickly. I think the developers could extend gameplay a bit by adjusting some mechanics like farming and base building, allowing players to explore and optimize those parts of the game before progressing.
[*] INVENTORY MANAGEMENT: Another major frustration. I constantly had to juggle inventories to the point where it became annoying. I felt that storage boxes were too small, and building many required annoying running around.
[*] MINIONS: The bots you can build to automate are a really great idea, but in practice, they were too buggy to actually work. They were constantly freezing (possibly unable to get to their destination?) so I constantly had to reset them. Towards the end game, I was just doing the work that they were supposed to do since I couldn't get them to do it for me.
[*] COOKING: Really unique cooking mechanic, learning recipes and skinning fish, though with the frustrating inventory management, cooking became a bit like juggling items.
[*] BUILDING: Great building mechanics, but I wish moving items was easier and didn't require an item. Just add a ""move"" button on the item's menu. I often found myself sticking with an ugly base just because it's a chore to get the mover item and then move things.
[*] FARMING: While I loved the way the farming mechanic was envisioned, it was a major disappointment but it seems so easy to fix: There's just no need to farm. Nearly all of the wild crops respawn, so there's no point to grow them yourself other than a few cases. Watering is too manual. The fact that you have to use the elevator to get to water in the early game was pretty annoying. Even once you get a sprinkler and pump, it's still extremely manual. Towards the end I just didn't do it because I didn't need to and I didn't enjoy doing it because of how manual it is.
[*] BASE DEFENSE: I was really confused by this mechanic. I understand that it's a ""cozy"" game and battling is not really the focus, but they added this great base defense mechanic that just isn't really done well. There's enemies around your base at night but they don't really pose a threat, and it's not worth building defense. They get into your garden and kill your crops, but if you just build not near their spawn points, there's no need to defend against them? It was also weird that you can't destroy their spawn points. My suggestion would be that the spawn points occasionally come back at night and you have to destroy them before they spread.
[*] EXPLORING: Loved the exploring mechanic, though I felt it was a little bit of a chore to explore. Everything while exploring just felt a little slow.
[*] Running feels too slow. There definitely should be a speed upgrade.
[*] Really unique dismantling mechanics that kept things more interactive rather than just point and click.
[*] Love the electricity management mechanic, though I wish it were a bit simpler to connect structures with just a point and click.

Even when you unlock different areas, it is just more of the dismantle stuff. All the areas look similar so basically you are just getting rid of stuff so you can walk to your location. You may not even need all the crap you get from dismantling so I left them lying around.
Once you have unlocked all the tools, it is just dismantle everything.
The balance of the game is also beyond bad.
You get too much of items and pretty much nothing to build with them.
By the end of the game, everywhere was littered with crap that I decided I didn't wanna bother to build storage for them.
Everything is excessive.
How many freaking light bulbs does the game think I need? I cannot even build lights!
I also detest the thorns and worms that KEEP GROWING. GIVE IT A REST DAMMIT! Even though I have turned off the option that prevents them from attacking my crops, I still need to keep spraying and spraying them every 2 min in real time otherwise my whole base ill be flooded with thorns.
I am sorry, but I think I have better things to do with my time than to keep doing pest control.
Also watering the plants is beyond painful. EVEN AFTER BUILDING THE GODDAMN SPRINKLER I still need to fill them manually with that one pail (that cannot be upgraded to a higher capacity).

To improve the game I suggest:
1. The ability to upgrade that one single pail to a higher capacity or remove the need to manually fill the sprinklers.
2. Thorns and worms need to be toned down alot or let us remove the stupid plants. You would think that that should be your priority, to get rid of the things that is causing your apocalypse, but you are wasting time finding games for Prospero and cooking for Earl. DUH. Priorities are not realistic.
3. Higher stack limits and balance the game a bit more so that I don't get millions of lightbulbs for example.
4. Is it really necessary to have map destinations that give metal sheets and glass? I have like a million of them lying on the ground. I definitely won't be needing to go to those places.

I bought this game as part of package during the black friday sale, and honestly probably would have refunded it if I didn't go over the 2 hour limit for the package.  But it does have a certain charm.  It might be one of those games that start out well but gets better as I go along.

It has hidden object mechanics which I totally hate.  I spent the first half hour clicking everywhere looking for a hand saw which is a style of gameplay I'm really not open to.  Then there's the movement - it's super-clunky.  Then there's the text boxes - personally, I think it has too many text boxes for a survival game.  For me, survival games are supposed to be about the gameplay, not the story.

The start isn't intuitive.  I think I'm probably going to have to watch a video to work out how to make my garden boxes to grow food.  My first attempt I ran out food, couldn't sleep because I was hungry but couldn't find enough food to keep going.

As a dad gamer who sometimes just needs a not-too-demanding, relaxing game, that just keeps you going, cause there's always the next thing to do - I found this a true gem. A resource/Survival game had a brief romance with solitaire and this game it the lovechild.

Don't jump in expecting a revolution in the genre, all the well-known mechanics are here for you to explore - the game doesn't guide you all to well - but I found it a positive.

Graphically it's what it is - a step lower and I wouldn't buy it - I've been playing since the 80s and I already had my share of pixel/blocky games - this one is good enough.

I was expecting a bit more music - the trailer somehow made me think that there's some decent soundtrack or even mechanics - for example finding and unlocking songs.

I think this is looking real good for me, and the dev keeps releasing more, so it's nothing like some of those abandoned and unfinished games clogging up things.

Update: Progress is happening nicely, and something you don't see with a lot of stuff these days, the dev actually tries to respond to people despite being busy working on the game! 
I even got an unexpected message telling me about a feature that's being worked on that takes care of a minor annoyance to me.  Heck, I wasn't even asking a question about that, just mentioned the issue in passing, though the update will make life easier for me and other players.

Pros: Cozy mode is a huge plus. Sincerely, as someone who plays a LOT of survival games and is a bit tired of edgy rugged gameplay, THANK YOU. Works well on older video cards FYI, I'm still rocking a GTX 680 (I know, I know - Christmas maybe) and it plays fine on 60 FPS! Very bright and chill aesthetic. The only 'enemies' are weeds and bugs that can turn into weeds. You craft bug spray to get rid of them, which is kinda genius lol

Cons: Some clunkiness with the controls - I'm using mouse and keyboard, I think controller support is to come later? - but nothing that would softlock or ruin the overall game experience. Some of the progression pathing isn't obvious (you HAVE to fish in order to unlock some early necessities) but its not hard to figure out & once you get far enough along you're pretty spoiled for resources. One awkward moment where a robot proclaimed her love for me, but she was okay with me letting her down gently. The automation is almost non-existent at this stage (I built the robot but it got stuck almost immediately), so I would love to see more of that/more improvements as the game develops.

General Feedback: Would love to see more character customization options because they're quite lacking - hair colours, more styles, skin tones, maybe a different gender?? I feel like the story is following him as a character and not a self-insert like many survival games afford you, but I don't see a reason why he can't be more customizeable or more self-insert, or a she even. Wish I could scrap more things and had more places to go/more places I could explore and interact with, as it feels very limited right now. Would love more world lore about the moon and the main character and their involvement/what happened to them. Would also love to see more accessibility features for my friends that need them, such as controller support, one-handed mode, colourblindness modes, and the ability to disable flashing effects (I don't recall seeing any but just as a note for future). Would also love a weather cycle, a rain collector, solar panels, a way to customize or improve on the sleeping area, and capacitors/batteries would be cool too. Robots that could garden and cook for me would also be swell!

After playing the game I found it didn't take very long to get to a point where you couldn't really do anything anymore other than chasing up the plants and worms etc. I joined the Dev's FB Group and initially listened to their posts about what they were going to do and offering a Q&A session with them.
This is where things went bad very quickly, the Dev's kept putting posts up saying they were going to do this and going to do that and what have we the gamers who spent our hard earned cash on this game get? Well the game released back in August and since then all we have received was a tiny patch and the ability to stack perspex sheets.... That's it!!!!! What an utter joke.
I've constantly posted in the FB Group and only yesterday did someone actually reply to me and all the reply was, was yet more false promises. TBH I feel like this game is just a SCAM to get us to buy it and the company are trying to get more people suckered in so they can get more cash until such time where they receive so many back reviews that they just do a runner and we never hear from them again. 

To put this whole thing into perspective, I bought Sunkenland the same time as I bout I am Future and Sunkenland have released a ton of updates, patches and additional content to their game and are still doing it presently.

[h1]The Good[/h1]
[list]
[*] The graphics are decent
[*] The disassembly minigames are fun enough and don't break the flow
[*] The idea and setting are nice
[/list]

[h1]The Bad[/h1]
[list]
[*] The PC's metabolism is out of control, having to feed him several full-sized meals every couple in-game hours. It appears the satiation meter is designed to drop rapidly when fully fed, but slower when near-starving. Meaning it makes more sense to keep your character perpetually hungry.
[*] Farming is anything but relaxing, requiring regular trips down the elevator (which triggers a loading screen each time) to gather the water which you then have to purify in the cooking tool, and then individually water each plant. I'm nearly 5 hours in and I've only just been told how to build a pump, but I'm still far away from getting the parts needed to do so.
[*] Speaking of, storage is a pain. Each box only holds 10 stacks, you can't walk through the boxes, there is limited building space, and no external indicator of contents. There is an upgrade about 3-4 hours in (expensive, of course) which enables you to access the contents of any box from any other box. Problem solved, right? Except it doesn't just combine all of the contents into one UI; you have to click a dropdown to select the other boxes. The game doesn't automatically number/name the boxes, so if you haven't been labeling each box, you're presented with 10 dropdown items labeled ""Storage Box 1.""
[*] The upgrades for the storage boxes are prohibitively expensive, so you're going to be filling your building space with small boxes you have to navigate around.
[*] While we're talking about storage, there's no way to ""auto-deposit"" all like items, so make sure you fill each box to capacity so you can rapidly right-click through your inventory to unload.
[*] Your inventory is similarly extremely restricted, with 10 stacks to start and upgrades (which only add 4 stacks) at very specific points of advancement.
[*] There are infinitely-spawning monsters at night. They fortunately don't damage you directly (unless you try to pick them up), but they will eat your plants and electric machines. (There is an option to disable the former consumption, but not the latter.)
[*] There are more ""death by a thousand cuts"" annoyances, but you get the point.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Wait for this to leave Early Access (if it ever does) and make sure to wait for a sale. Again: good idea, bad execution. This needs a dozen balance patches before it's worth playing. 3/7",1699381161,1699381161,False,3,0,0.48228880763053894,1,True,False,True

The premise is exactly what the name says: a cozy apocalypse survival game. So far it manages to make you think without making you stressed. The vibe is great, the art and music and sound are great, the gameplay is shaping up to be great. The story for the campaign is interesting so far. It's not reinventing the wheel but it's doing the wheel very well. I am very interested in seeing what's next, the campaign such as it is feels like you get to the end of the prologue when the story cuts off.

When it says early access it doesn't mean the game is done and they're tweaking the balance (at the time of this review.) Whole parts of the game are missing. Areas say ""coming soon"" and you cannot completely level buildings or finish research because of it. So if you want a complete game I recommend putting this on your wishlist and following the game for updates.

* Perfect, relaxed progress system with managable ressources.
* Fishing done right!
* Sarcastic, funny interactions with ""npc's""!

My absolute favorite thing in the game: The little [i]""yay""[/i] our main character (Lucius?) says after he catches something. Absolutely [b]adored[/b] the voice.
The artwork and concept is really nice, too! I love postapocalyptic environments where nature takes it all back, it's sunny, and clear sky and plants absolutely everywhere!

[hr][/hr]

Sure, there are some bugs here and there, and some elements need to be worked over and fixed.
 (Like... I would be really happy if I could store my acrylic glass panes somehow, or take two Woodbeams out of their storagerack without needing to put one down first, Not being able to name the storagechests...)

But I'm sure with all the feedback and the hardworking team, there will be much improvement in the coming updates.

[hr][/hr]

Maybe a few ideas:
I did't like having to walk far distances everytime i needed to get around my base. And it feels like very much empty space once I cleared the areas. Would be super nice to have more decorative or functional items/structures I can build. Like new couches, tables, different storages for food....

First, some positives. The graphics are great. The colors are vibrant, the character is defined, and everything looks great. Also, it was easy to move around (I am on PC) and interact with the environment. Another positive, at least for me, is that it is truly relaxing in the sense that there is no fighting (so far). I don't mind fighting in games, but I do like my farming-like games to be focused on just that.

Although there are definitely some positives to this game, I found there to be more negatives. At this point, I don't think that there is enough to make it worth playing. I feel that the gameplay and quests are not explained well enough for the average player (i.e. Me). The mechanics were somewhat confusing to me, and I had some trouble figuring out what to do next. But, the biggest issue I have with this game as it currently stands is the lack of purpose. This type of game really needs purpose. What is the point? Why am I doing this? The answers to these questions should be apparent. Unfortunately, this game does not currently have an obvious purpose. Looking at the Q&A that the devs just released, I do think that the purpose will become clear in time. For now, though, I won't be continuing to play this game.

You awake on a rooftop of a skyscraper in a ruined world and slowly uncover who you were, what happened, and why you survived.

There's a light automation element towards the end where you can build robots who will tend your farms, clear things up etc. For an EA release it's very polished, and feels very satisfying to play. There are areas of the game that are roped off and coming soon, but there's already a great experience there.

[b]Pros[/b]
- Already runs really well in EA
- Beautiful simplistic graphics
- All resources are renewable
- Interesting setting
- Many things you come across are collected in different ways rather than just clicking on them, which makes it more engaging
- I like the object dissassembly minigame (although more variety in objects please)
- Blueprints for upgrading tools
- Can pin recipes to remember what you're doing
- Interesting crafting recipes
- You fix up a drone which can go out exploring for you, and discover locations with renewable loot and story elements
- There are NPCs to meet and bring back to base
- Minion bots to carry stuff around
- Has some quests, not just survival

The game is an isometric survival game with a strong focus on organising and upgrading. You start in a small area on top of a building, you have a robotic and start collecting resources. At night worms start attacking your crops and buildings sometimes, evil plants will also spread.
You have to feed yourself, upgrade your base(you can move everything around), unlock new areas but also go exploring with a drone, fishing, minor puzzles, harvesting some resources that respawn and meet some characters.
Pro: fun, complex, has a nice upgrade logic, mini-games are interesting, unlocking new areas is nice, upgrading your character with new tools(feels like dysmantle), base building is nice
Cons: bad tutorial, doesn't explain anything useful, some people might not like all the mini-games, it's hard to pick up the game, early access is not very big, no combat or very little

The pickup limit of 1 plank or metal, water bottles being one-time use, then craft again just feels... wrong. I'm not a fan of having a hazard that damages me with no option to just squash them. While I can handle limited inventory, if I have to build chests to have storage, I need to be able to move those chests easily. The many little jutting things in my base make walking around difficult, making this game less fun to play. I'm still not sure how cooking OR crafting work after almost 3 hours of gameplay...

I'm open to changing my mind if they actually progress the game, but it still needs work 
There's a basic road-map available, however there's no timescales and only half the things you want are on there so its a bit disappointing. None of the issues are deal breakers, but altogether it adds up. However the thing I currently absolutely hate is electricity. Electricity runs out all the time, even with 4 reactors its runs out fast and then filling them becomes a full time job making the game fairly unplayable. Robots should handle this, but they don't. After that, they could fix some of the following ... 
+ Quality of Life changes. Parts of the game are just finicky
+ unfinished research, most of which promises to make the game better
+ constant repetitive tasks like fishing for plastic or components
+ robots/minions should be more helpful than they are and can't do obvious tasks 
+ other electrical network improvements could help, like solar panels? batteries? windmills?  
+ you have to switch off farming for food, otherwise the game is a chore, but the option being there is helpful 
+ more diverse appliance deconstructions: after you've done the first 6 kettles the following dozen aren't fun anymore

You'll see literal signs that say ""coming soon"" on them, so keep that in mind. The demo gives you about 2-3hrs playtime, and my experience in its current state is about 15-20hrs depending on how much you enjoy organising and gathering. 

The addition of the minions, as a concept, is very nice. Even when they broke (and they did....) they were a godsend when there's three areas just covered in materials that I don't want to pick up myself. Let alone the ability to make 15 machines at once without losing my mind. Farming, crafting, deconstructing, it's all here if you're into that kind of gameplay. I used the ""maximum coziness"" setting, so nothing harmed me and I didn't starve, but that can be augmented in the moment for a bit more challenge. I enjoy the fishing mechanic quite a bit, it's simple enough for someone with physical issues, like me, but still provides a pleasant mini game.  I'd like to see more of what is coming and what the game has to offer. Currently it's an hour of entertainment per $1 spent and that's my limit on value, but it's not a great score overall.

I'll make a quick breakdown of my main issues with the game:

[list]
    [*] [b]Progression:[/b] Really slow and every task feels like a chore until late in the game.
    [*] [b]Movement:[/b] Just boring. Moving is too slow and it's hard to tell collision boxes for objects on the map. In a game where you're constantly going from one spot to another and dodging things, this gets old quickly.
    [*] [b]UI:[/b] Clunky and dated. Not the worst look, but inconsistent (for example, sometimes ESC is used to exit a menu and other times it's right-click). I feel like controls in general need an improvement.
    [*] [b]Building:[/b] Just “meh”. Setting up and moving things around could be more intuitive for this kind of game.
    [*] [b]Crafting:[/b] Needs an overhaul. The filters don't help much, and scrolling through many options to find something is a pain.
    [*] [b]Farming:[/b] Repetitive, demanding multiple boring steps.
    [*] [b]Gathering:[/b] Grindy, made even worse the by slow movement and the weird rule for certain resources of only moving one of them at a time.
    [*] [b]Inventory management:[/b] Messy. You'll often end up having to access multiple storages to get something simple done.
    [*] [b]Automation:[/b] More annoying than actually helpful. There's no automation for crafting, only gathering. The other two options for robots are virtually useless.
    [*] [b]Fishing minigame:[/b] Not gonna lie, it's one of the worst I've seen in video games.

For an early access game, it works surprisingly well, as a lot of those games are usually full of bugs. I didn't have any game-breaking bugs, just UI problems that were fixable by entering construction mode, and two minion that got stuck. I found out later I was able to move them to unstuck them.

It's EA so maybe it's just too fresh out of the oven and needs more content and balancing, but the stuff that is already in the game, every mechanic and item are so simplistic it becomes tedious very quickly. 
Even core content, like the fishing game which is meant to be relaxing ...I'd just rather not.

It's ok.  I Mean, it's quirky and interesting for the first 20 or so minutes, but after that it gets annoyingly repetitive.

It's a total slog trying to build a way to get to another rooftop, the weeds are relentlessly annoying and basically a timer since you're going to eventually run out of resources trying to get rid of them.  So you're in a rush to get to a high enough tier to kill the plants that are spawning them.

There is no penalty for not sleeping that I've seen.  It's only really needed if you want to fast forward time.

Pros:
1. It was hard to stop playing this game.
2. I love games that are casual, not too difficult or too complex.   Just the right amount of stuff to do that keeps you 
    playing and wastes all of your time in a day before you even realize it.  LOL  :-)
3. I like the visual style. I like the  none stressful game play and game progression is good.
4. The price for this game is just right!  Other developers should take note for Early Access style games!

Cons (if I had to come up with some):
1. I feel as a Early Access Game, it probably on has about 12 to 15 hours of game play before your done.  (A lot of coming 
    soon  areas in the game)
2.  The reason it has currently 15 hours of game play is that you do have to gather a lot of stuff, break it down, drill, chop, 
    etc.    (Doesn't bother me, but could be a negative for some people).

All in all,  I put this game in my top 5 current time wasting games.  (time wasting is a good thing, in this scenario!)

Nice overall, the only cosmetic flaw is the character in the lower window never changing even if the player changes the character's overall appearance.

I'm not going to spoil the game for anyone, but the path to cleaning up the rooftop is most appealing to the kind of individuals that like to organise a garden and a small business with a bit of electrical engineering on the side. As a base builder it appeals to my urge to see a plan become a virtual reality.

The good:
-It is calming, and I don't feel like my character is going hungry all the time, which is nice because I hate hunger bars
-The bot automation is fun
-Watching the rooftop slowly transform as you clean and de-clutter it is very satisfying

I have encountered quite a few glitches while playing it.
-Sometimes the item duplicator stops on its own
-I could not get the builder robot to contribute to any builds I had put up, even with the items required in chests
-The lift to the water place where you fish is hard to click on sometimes (especially when going back up)
-I cannot for the life of me get the Grow 20 Plants achievement to activate, I have grown more than 20, so I am trying to have 20 growing at the same time to see if this activates it
-When transitioning from day to night-time, the game lags and frames drop quite a bit for a little while
-Random frame drops and lag sometimes happen

Some things I just didn't love:
-The fishing mini-game felt a little too slow, the pointer could be faster
-The chests NEED some sort of auto-sorting, especially once you unlock the pooled chests where all the inventory is together

I Am Future feels like a fresh take on the genre, with lots of little details that keep it interesting. I find it very satisfying just to wander around scavenging materials. The early access feels like a good experience, with just enough content to fill 15 - 20 hours. I did get stuck once because I misunderstood the ""coming soon"" message on the expedition map and thought it represented a whole FEATURE that was coming soon and not just that certain map areas were not yet accessible. Once I figured that out everything else was smooth and engaging. 

Some things I'd like to see:
* A way to permanently get rid of items. I am drowning in plant goo.
* An easy way to move around larger scenery objects that you find in the world (like you can with the pots) and maybe even use the repair functionality to ""refurbish"" them. There are some cool furniture pieces by the pool that I want to put in my base!
* A way to kill the mama plants. It could even be an item that is hard to make, I don't mind. Just let me get rid of them!

I really hate a game that has a high sense of urgency and punishes me for my desired playstyle. So far I've only played a few hours of I am future and really enjoying it. It's a cozy survival game that respects everyone's pace and playstyle. Fruits/plants/vegetables are all over the place so it's hard to die of starvation, materials are also abundant, crafting is not too complicated, cooking/foraging/fishing are also simplified. It's laid back but it's also challenging and can even be hectic in it's own way. Overall my whole experiences in the game are mostly positive so thumbs up for now. 

Few suggestions/feedbacks I have with the game.
- I wish I would be able to keep 99 of all the items or materials rather than 20, because it just take unnecessary storage space and I just end up throwing a lot of them out.
- It would be cool to sell some of the items I don't need, because a lot of them just ends up as waste that accumulates over the surroundings.
- Hunger really needs some tweaking.
- Water bucket needs to be able to hold more water and atleast make the sprinklers automatic.
- I wish there was a way to skip the fishing minigame entirely. It does get rather annoying if I have a lot of bait with me and plan to catch a lot of fishes.
- Blue and black goo really needs to have more uses to them.",1691594175,1692092600,True,76,2,0.885024428367614746,0,True,False,True

I only got it yesterday or something and I've got 7 hours down already. I might be a little addicted. and usually I wouldn't give a review so soon, I like to learn everything before I review BUT I saw a cute post from the devs asking for reviews so I kinda ran here because I do actually really like this game and want it to do well. 

I already owned Dinkum so I managed to get the game for under 10 pounds as part of a bundle deal & I do not regret it. 

So the grind of needing parts & supplies to build everything reminds me of the game 'My time in Portia' The needing to get rid of the toxic weeds reminds me of 'Disney Dreamlight valley' I also loved those games. My main genre of games that I play are Survival, Simulation & Story based RPG's so I was excited to try this one out and currently I'm having a lot of fun with it. I'm not that far into the game so I might come back & edit this review once I've unlocked more.. Although.. can anyone tell me how to get metal for the bridge! not sheet metal but the other metal.. it says I need a resource printer but where do I get that? LOL 

Anyhoo.. 

I like that the game doesn't force you to sleep unless you need to for health.
The game looks beautiful & feels cute & cozy even though you are trying to build & survive & complete the goals. I hate the glowworm things and I need a big weapon to blast them with please :)
 
The one thing I would ask for in a future update is the possibility of choosing the character you play to be female so the player can choose to be female or male & relate more to their character.

Hopefully the developer/developers fix the achievement issue. Some of them started to count over time as I played but it took 3+ hours for them to do so. I should have 100% right now but the achievements weren't counting. I did see however that on the 14th-17th of this month or something like that they planned to release a patch for the ending, specific achievements, and other stuff

[Update]
It's the 14th no game update which is fine, but I did do a new save and across 3 saves I was able to get all 3 ending achievements even though I should have gotten then all on my 1st save. Buying everything from a ecomate is still bugged and so is eating a energy bar (I've ate 10 so far across all 3 saves)

Presently what the player can do is straightforward, and just starting out. Setting up the base is fun for 6-8 hours, though somewhat rough around the edges. Automation is minimalistic, but also kinda pointless at the moment, the player will quickly go into food overproduction, while mostly rare materials will bottleneck crafting.
Story content though is minimal at the moment, it would be real nice to have some stronger narrative to follow.

My journey across the Early Access troubleshooting:
[spoiler]
Ok, so after hours of trials, I finally conclude that I managed to deadlock my game progression:
When Stan's shop was unlocked I chose to buy the robot parts, there was no money left to purchase the drill bits. Simultaneously I'm out of electrolytic solution, so I can't build the crypto farm. Oh, and I also did not get blueprint for generator yet, so not that a crypto farm could help me.
I've been looking for solution for hours, but na-ah. I'm at day 13, built a grill kitchen and upgraded worktable, unlocked everything from the first ecomate, built multiple bridge levels until the metal frames stopped me. Active quests: ""build charging station"", ""build crypto farm"", ""build a bridge: second level of columns"", ""energizing coffee: learn recipe"", ""farming past: fix the pumps"". All quests are blocked due to resource shortage or lack of money.
With how the game handles saves (keeping just a single save with no chance of rerolling progress), I'd say this is an unfortunate oversight.
I try it again, but damn, this is disheartening.

EDIT:
Launched a second profile. Every object on the roof is doubled. I can repeate the same interaction with them twice.

EDIT 2:
Ok, the duplication glitch is prohibitive of the gameplay, because I can't remove the leach from the door leading to the second area. Also, lighting seems to be off and my FPS has tanked.
Third attempt looks to be free of this bug.

EDIT 3:
All right, so I'm technically not stuck on the first profile, or at least not with the electrolytic solution, because there is a special evil night plant that can spawn and drop one. It just didn't bother spawning for over 8 nights, while on the 3rd profile I already found one on day 4. Won't o back to the old save anyways, just wanted to tell.

---

The minions could be really useful in a future update. My main complaints are:
  1. You cannot whitelist/black list the item they will collect. You either select SPECIFIC items or ""automatic selection"". For example, I want to be able to set one of them to only get wood planks.
  2. The path finding needs some love.
  3. The minion engineers need also some higher level of intelligence. I want to be able to set conditions and actions for them- Not blindly assume they will figure-out what to do (because they dont, they dont have any level of prioritization). This way automating stuff like electricity would actually be possible.

On the rest of the game:
  1. The recipes are really cool and fun to discover. Feels rewarding and not over complicated. My only complaint is that some ingredients are needlessly monotonous to get, like drinkable water (which many recipes require).
  2. The art-style, atmosphere, environment are nice on the eyes.
  3. QOL like ""send to storage button"", directly accessing the main functionality of the machine (instead of choosing between electricity and the machines main task), and others would make the game more pleasant. 
  4. Without a way of actually automating the electricity its impossible to get a reasonable amount of late game items with the printer. It takes too long to print them and you have to constantly restart the process when the electricity goes down (This might be a bug).
  5. Farming, in my opinion, needs balancing. The advanced beds are too expensive and don't actually help much (other than growing the seed all day long), and again, they require electricity, which is a very valuable resource at the current state of the game.
  6. Getting important items (like the ones needed to create more minions) feels, or are, impossible to get outside of the initial amount available. But Im sure this will change in later updates.
---

This game feels really nice to play and its clear the amount of effort the developers put into it. The story feels like a background story till basically the end of chapter one, but is nice and enjoyable. The minions is a very very cool idea and with some improvements can become a cooler aspect of the game.

The game itself at is core seems to remind me of Disney's dream lite valley. Where you can craft stations, make new dishes and yo thort off pesky plants and bugs. While tho is repetitive is very fun and i quite enjoy the atmosphere. I do have some key features i love about the game.

1. The atmosphere and sounds are very nice and relaxing
2. Crafting system al though not alot and more will come are very nice
3. Building needs work through early access but is very solid and good to get a hold of.

Some bugs and issues i ran into and made feedback.

1. Minions will get stuck on everything, and anything. They will constantly forget there inputs and what they need to grab and where to put the.
2. At the beginning hunger is very overwhelming and is a big issue more most players and needs to be tuned down a fair bit.
3. The thorns and bugs are a big nuisance and a real ""thorn in my butt"" You will constantly be destroying them every day and you collect more goop then you could ever use. I have 4 crates of them and while in early access this plant enemy and bugs spawns need also to be turned down a fair bit.

With the current content in the game you can get through with it about 8 hours, and that is it really. You can contiue to fine tune your base and organize everything and dismantale everything but there is not real point.

At its current state and price is a very rewarding and fun game i thing you should try. It's a very nice touch to the survival genre and i can't wait to see where the team takes this game.

1. I was at full health and satiety and then out of nowhere I started to die and I could not get myself out of it even when I tried eating something. I thought a relaunch of the game would set it back to the previous 4-5 minutes before the issue occurred, but it just brought me to the point where I was dying. I tried to see what might have been killing me, but I was standing near my workbench. Had to start a new game.

2. I got stuck. Plain and simple. Cut down a tree and couldn't get myself out of the area. Even with a relaunch. That was a frustrating end to that second game.

3. I play at ""Home Mode"" so I shouldn't lose health, but I still do. I can't leave my game running and disappear or my Character will die.

4. The Save option. Sometimes it says ""Not Available"" and sometimes it saves, but it has happened that I save my game, leave and when I get back it launches at a different point than where I saved. 

5. Logs and Scrap. If I want to gather all my logs and scrap to one area I can't. When I drop them they just continuously stack on top of each other and it happened that I could not longer reach the last ones I dropped (even though it didn't look like they were too far up), and I ended up having logs and scrap pieces floating in the air lol

I understand what you get with Early Access, I work as a QA Analyst so I know there are bugs that come with the game, so please don't take my comment as a complaint, but as feedback to know the issues that are occurring in game :)

All in all as you see I have already clocked in about 30 hours into the game so it is fun and I like it, but I would have progressed farther if it weren't for those two blockers. Here's hoping for a better third round!

I could not figure out how to get automation going in a productive way.

The areas you are building on top of have a cramped feeling to them. The game seems to love its fishing for acquiring resources.

This game shares similar beats to Dysmantle.

Cautiously optimistic. It's clear some effort went into this title, so I don't want to give it a thumbs down, but I've gotten more longevity out of SimJank for similar prices.

Update: Everything happens way too quickly for this to be more than a $10 title. This game needs far more polish on its systems and how it feels to actually play.

[h1][b]1) Short game..[/b][/h1]

The main disadvantage (flaw) of this game is the length - it's too short story wise, the map is also quite small. At first, when I launched the game and loaded the map, I thought the map would become much larger at mid-game, but in fact it is only 3 locations (areas) similar in size to the starting area + 1 tiny fish area, which can only be accessed with a loading screen (more on this below). Of course, the map will get a bit bigger in the future, as in some places I saw stairs with ""Coming Soon"" sign.

[h1][b]2) Loading screens..[/b][/h1]

The loading screen appears in 2 situations - when you enter the fishing area, and every time you send your drone on an expedition. I had no problems with expeditions, everything is fine with that. But imagine a loading screen every time you need to fish or fetch water? I avoided fishing as much as I could, but if you are planning on farming (which is an important part of the game) you will need to water these agricultural plots and every time you want to water these plots you will have to go to the fishing area, fill the bucket with water and water the plots, if you have many plots you will need to complete several ""loading screen"" routes to water all the plots. This is annoying and partly kills the pleasure of further playing this game. [b]SPOILER[/b] in the next sentence: [spoiler]Fortunately, somewhere in the middle of the game you can get a new fishing spot (no loading screen) and build a sink somewhere near the farm to get water without a loading screen.[/spoiler]

[b]SUGGESTION:[/b] Just get rid of that ""loading screen"" fishing zone and instead place it (pool for example) somewhere in the starting zone, maybe add something blocking the path to it and we need to ""do something"" to ""unlock"" that part of the area.

[h1][b]3) No survival aspect, just a cozy relaxing game[/b][/h1]

Even though I love cozy games, I feel like this game requires more challenging aspects of survival. At the moment there are only 2 things to survive - a health bar and a hunger bar. The health bar is hardly an issue, never died in this game. Same thing with the hunger bar, food is too easy to get, and some food just fills up the radiculuos amount of the hunger bar, so that's not a problem either, especially after the mid game. Sleep does nothing other than regenerate your health bar and reduce your hunger bar a bit.

[b]SUGGESTIONS:[/b]
• Crops have to wither: if they are not watered for a long time or not harvested in time, the crops will wither and you will lose your yield (maybe still being able to get worms from wilted crops would be a good idea). This will make farming more challenging and fun.
• Player energy system: every action in the game should take some % of your energy bar, sleep should restore your energy. If your energy bar drops to zero, you have a chance to pass out and remain unconscious for the next 24 hours, putting your crops at risk of withering.
• Maybe making the ""night worms"" more dangerous in one way or another would also be a good idea, since I never really cared for them and just used my ""anti-parasitic spray"".

[h1][b]4) Some QoL features are missing[/b][/h1]

I love games with a lot of items to be managed, stored and sorted into different storages etc, inventory management is one of the features in games that is really important to me but my OCD still requires some QoL features, at least automatic storage sorting. 

[b]SUGGESTIONS:[/b]
• With the click of a button, your items in storage or inventory should be sorted by name or type. 
• Also, I couldn't find a way to name your chests (maybe I'm just blind).
• The ability to craft from nearby storages can also be added with mid-game upgrade modules.

[h1][b]Good things about this game[/b][/h1]

✔ Every action (cutting, drilling, fishing etc.) in the game has its own mini-game. Makes the overall gameplay more diverse and fun.
✔ Beautiful visuals, vibrant and colorful.
✔ Has a story (not the best, not exactly unique, but ""okay"" for this genre/type of game) for those who like story games.
✔ Build anywhere you want, not only in the starting area.
✔ Chef Mode: You don't know all the food recipes at the start, so you will always need to mix different ingredients in Chef Mode to learn new recipes.
✔ [b]I Am Future[/b] is clearly an Early Access Game as you can see a lot of ""Coming Soon"" features including new tools and areas. This is clearly a good thing, as it means that the game will receive new content soon and is not yet abandoned.
✔ I don't know why, but I liked the music that starts at night. It's just so relaxing..

[b]Overall, the game is really worthy. It is short, but no matter how much time you spend in this game, you will have fun and enjoy it, especially if you like cozy or farm games.[/b]

[h1][b]Looking forward to Steam Deck compatibility![/b][/h1]

Of course there are very minor QoL balances to be ironed. The Current playerbase are already identifying them within the Discussions including myself.

Above all, it's a very good start, solid foundations for Early Access as it should be. Noticed the Developers are active with feedback within the comments and forums. So this to me is clearly a visible and communicative team with players and focus to create a quality game  :):)

The dream of this game for me is to create army of those awesome Minions (hopefully they get some sort of Minion-Warrior chipset so can fight, personalised names) and then conquer every single roof top, enslave all machines and take over the city!

1) In the various construction menus, can you sort to the top the items that you can build with what is currently in your inventory? I didn't realize that the workbench had so many more options to choose from and I was stuck for a while trying to figure out how to advance. Granted I should have tried scrolling down but I still think it would be helpful if those menus could sort to the top recipes that you have the materials for. 

2) The quest text in shown in the note pad in the upper right-hand side are really vague. This wouldn't be a problem if we could click on them and get some additional details or hints. Would it be possible to add a feature like that to the quest notes?

That being said I hope this will be visible to others and the development team. My play time is roughly 9 hours, and my tool upgrades are at the current max, [spoiler] I have the bridge built [/spoiler], and I've broken down everything I can in the first few areas.

I'm having a blast. This game is fun, cozy, and definitely scratches an itch I've had for a while. I played the demo a while back and that pretty much sold the game to me. The graphics are great, gameplay is solid, and I haven't encountered a bug yet. I recommend this game to anyone who likes top down survival games. 

However, I have some gripes. 

1: Food: As you progress and gather different seeds, you get access to better satiating plates. These are basically useless to me because the amount of materials required to give you +50 food is way more time consuming than going fishing to make patties en mass. With how quickly your food deteriorates, there is no point in putting all the time in to gather all the materials necessary to make some of the higher end food stuffs. That brings me to my second gripe:

2: Hunger: Wow does hunger go quickly. It seems the more you eat, the quicker your hunger goes. You get a bonus to carry one extra item if you bring your food levels up past 65, but that lasts only a minute or two because your hunger depletes when its over 65 (it seems) by double. If I'm not taking up an inventory space carrying 10 food items, I can't get much done. Again, crafting some of the good food items takes 4-5 different food items to get a measly +50 satiation that lasts only 5 minutes. Hunger depletion is probably my biggest problem.     

3: Carrying items: With your cybernetic hand, you can only carry one item. With 65+ food, you can carry two until you upgrade your hand. Then you can carry a max of three. For how far you have to meander around to gather these materials, the carry amounts should be doubled. Which brings me to>>>Storage

4: Storage chests are okay with spacing for a tier one build, but that's all you get as I've seen so far. The metal and wood storage only hold ten pieces each. So while you're running from one side of the map to the other to gather 2-3 at a time and run it all back, you will end up wasting materials on building these storages that don't really hold much. So currently, I have a mountain of wood and metal  cluttering my screen. Plexiglas (as far as I have seen in my time played) doesn't have a storage unit, so you definitely have to make a mountain of that in your storage area. 

I understand this game is in early access and has more to come, things will change, and overall the game will improve. However I hope this review finds the dev team respectfully as feedback and the community as a fair review. I recommend this game and give it a 6.5/10 for now, and will update my review as things change.",1691791789,1691791789,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The game has potential but there are some really not enjoyable aspect to it:
- getting food in a reliable way is very far into the gameplay. They should improve food availability or hunger management at the start of the game (like provide some starting food supplies or sources).
- the fishing mini game gets boring and actually annoying very fast as you will have to grind it for some specific resources. Just make it automatic after you reach something like 100 fishes. 
- there is only one type of mob and it will generate a completely useless amount of resource that you can not dispose of. Just create a system to sell unused resources.
- the helper bots are useless as they are very inaccurate in their behaviour like for example collecting resources. Developers should improve the instructions that you can give to the bots.
- some machines that produce certain key resources are very slow and this does not add anything to the game experience. Just make the machine produce as fast as the main character does (almost instantaneous). 
- there is a super annoying loading screen between the main area and the fish / water area that will make you swear to god because you have to go back and forth hundreds of times to have some farming going. Just put the damned water on the roof top like with an already existing pump.
- to create the best food recipes you will need a lot of water. but guess what, to produce drinkable water you need COAL! And the production of coal requires grinding of wood. How is it possible that a guy that can build a flight drone and automated bots, still needs COAL to produce drinkable water? Just introduce a desalination machine.
- every machine you will create will need electric energy. Guess what: there is not an end game source of electricity. Your only way to produce energy is to compost biomass at several composter because your machine will burn it very fast. Just introduce other sources of energy like solar panel or with other type of resources (like the shit the mobs leave behind that is currently completely useless)

Aside from this the game is almost relaxing and enjoyable.
I would not suggest you to purchase the game in the current status as:
- the developer can clearly still improve it but they could lose the driver to do it
- it is quite expensive for the current amount of game content

Lastly, I'm certainly I'm not the only one that wants a way to get rid of those nasty purple plants. Due to circumstances they created, I unfortunately found myself unable to live, laugh, love and also build the base of my dreams so there's also that.

There is so much to be done even in a small area, and it expands little by little with equipment addition. 

The game is mostly gathering stuffs and crafting stuffs, but everything needed is just here and there or a bit over there, so we're kept busy. The tool mechanic makes sense and the mini game disassembling stuffs is quite fun. Crafting is done quite fast, and the game mechanic is simple but very satisfying and rewarding. Progress keeps moving forward bits by bits.

I like everything about this game, but if I have to point out one thing that feels lacking is storage boxes, not too much, for me it just needs icons or text on the storage box so I can know what that box is for, like food, materials, ingredients, electric stuffs, etc. So I can organize better. -edit- turns out it has color code, and there is a storage network module that let us access all chest contents from any chest (maybe like a linked chest in other game), but it's buggy and not working as it should right now. So the game already has everything I want.

I don't mind the micro management for items in inventory/storages in this game since it's kinda part of the game, and I can just drop stuffs on the ground. It's not the kind of game that will despawn things if dropped on the ground. For some stuffs like food and some category I put them in a box though. It's ok even keeping stuffs on the ground. It makes it more authentic as a working area, having stuffs scattered around. Imo the game should let us do that, stacks stuff on the ground in addition to having items inside storage so it shows how many items in the stack on the ground and can be added. Like in other game, Scrap Mechanic, but in this game anything dropped is 1 item and no stack, but can be dropped on top of each other to make a stack, but it's a 3rd person game not top down view.

One thing that I like best is TIME STOPS when opening storage boxes, or any menu, even when fishing, at first I thought it breaks the immersion for fishing, but the point of fishing is just getting things that you need/want, so it also makes sense to let us fish as long as we want, because we will end it eventually after getting enough. So that's ok.

The game has no combat but we can kill bugs/parasite plant using sprays.

The item economy on this game is good, nothing sits for too long, you'll use most of every item you gathered/crafted to progress.

Now I just hope the game isn't a short one. 

-edit-
after 10h of playing seems like I've reached the end of content from the current stage of the game. It's kinda short though. The last time I played a game similar to this that was heavily on crafting with good item economy was Force of Nature 2 with 100h-ish of content.

Very simple little explorer/builder game. Lovely graphics, music works to create atmosphere. Where else can you find a game like this that lists a 'cosy factor' along with it?  Huh?

Early access, because the content is limited somewhat. You'll get about ten to fifteen hours if you want to build absolutely everything. There are clear areas 'coming soon', and if they deliver on that, I think there is real potential here for more gameplay options. The enemy system isn't yet developed which is a clear option for better development, but at the risk of making it a bit silly. Also need to get more sophisticated with the pacing and the use of minions. But all that is doable, and as an early product, this actually shines pretty well.

The gameplay loop strikes a nice balance of addicting and relaxing. The fact that the game focuses more on [i]decluttering[/i] instead of simply resource gathering gives an additional jolt of happiness when you finished cleaning out things and putting them on their rightful places.

I think the difficulty (and lack thereof) is also nice. This is not a hardcore survival sim and it makes it clear with the relative lack of urgency and threats. The worst enemies you can get will only harm your plants and nothing more.

The writing is...a mixed bag. I love the item and places description; it gives a clear sense of wistfulness longing for a world that is no more that is also added with an occasional hint of humor. But at the same time the most criticism I have right now is that after a certain point the world feels empty. While the first area provides a lot of worldbuilding, the same cannot be said with each subsequent area 'opened'. Currently new areas just feel like new things to do, new resources to find, new clutter to clean. I think that works against the coziness this game tries to project.

Characters also feel very one note. I get that this game is aiming for lighthearted and quirky instead of deep and complex, but I feel some more layers to our characters would be nice. Feminine-presenting individuals in particular also fall into outdated stereotypes of being either shrill or helpless. 

And then there's the protagonist; it's clear from the presentation that we are meant to play the story of one very specific character as opposed of creating our own avatar, and yet we don't learn much about our protagonist up to this point. On that vein we also have no idea about other inhabitants of this city aside from the present companions. There might be a twist in this particular plot point, but even such twist requires more buildup. 

Because this is an Early Access game, I can absolutely forgive them for all of this. The game already has a strong foundation; I hope it will continue to be built upon.",1691735828,1691735828,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True
1658040,143844373,76561198088680788,0,1,751,0,751,1691724837,"[b] Okay. I love this game. [/b] 

I saw a Let's Play style video of this game and became intrigued enough that I wanted to buy it. Then saw it on sale for $13 and that felt like a steal so I picked it up. No regrets. I'm excited to see what this game expands into as it grows. As it is I didn't stop playing because I was bored or wanted to stop, I stopped playing because I ran out of things to do and had broken nearly everything down. There was nothing left to do. The moment there is new content and a new places to explore, I'll be back to well...explore. 

Even the most amazing games have flaws and this one is absolutely no exception. Early game is a bit dicey life wise. I managed to never die but I think I existed solely on the brightflowers for the beginning of the game and fish in the middle. When you get farming that's when the food pressure eases and one can enjoy the diversity of the food options as well as the neat-o way of discovering new dishes. (I did end up looking some up because I couldn't figure them all out on my own but it was fun to try). 

The leeches / worms that come for your food and target it specifically are annoying and frustrating, especially early game. Once one gets the hang of them it's not as bad but still annoying as there's nothing that let's you leave your main space safely during the time they come about. Having to run back to your camp to save your crops is stressful or being chained to them when one wants to explore is a bummer. The high tier items don't really 'stop' the leech/worm things, only ""slow them down"". This is however, the only main danger in the game besides starving and it's more annoying than truly dangerous. Perhaps in later updates there will be a way to stop them and the plants. Who knows. 

THE MINIONS. They are almost laughably unhelpful. Very cute and I still love them but very unhelpful. They do indeed shove items in any box they like. Even if there's already a half stack in a another box. They kept shoving worm tentacle ends and goop in my gardening box which was amusing. I wanted them to gather the metal/planks into their storage racks but I don't know if my game glitched or what but there was one storage rack they would not fill no matter how much I encouraged them to / ordered them to. At one point, in protest I think, my minion took a set of planks, brought them downstairs and away from their storage location, and shoved them through a wall. Then stood there for a while until I took his 'plank only' restrictions off. I never saw those planks again. 

I also don't know if there is a max on plank/sheet metal storage but I could only build five before I could no longer build another one because I couldn't supply the planks into the blueprint. Again, I don't know if I glitched or there is a limit to how many storage racks that can be built or what but any hopes to organize the glittering litany of chaos that is the sea of planks and metal has been dashed. Instead they lay on the ground, clipping joyfully through each other. 

I don't enjoy being forced to play a male character. I'm a woman, I enjoy playing as a woman. Dressing up the opposite gender is just not as fun as dressing up my own gender so the I didn't appreciate the outfit system like it probably should've been appreciated. Story wise, it feels necessary to be guy. Real life social climate wise, it kinda feels bad. It might be kinda cool to have a woman character to work towards to unlock to play as or something. I don't know. Not really my place to be injecting ideas onto a game. 

There are a few more buggy/ glitch things that happen. Like there is a specific machine that turns off every time I enter 'exploration' mode or either the workshop/ kitchen. I have to stop and tell it to 'create' again. I lost a quite a few minutes waiting for that machine to produce when it was randomly stopped. Quest marks that won't go away. An entire area that I could never figure out if I could get to? Progression is confusing at a few points. There's missing text for certain items. But I mean, it's early access. I'm sure a lot of these things will get fixed. 

I will also say there are a lot of upgrades that happen in the game if one sticks with it that help with some of the things that are complaints in other reviews. I mean, I don't want to spoil or anything. I personally enjoy that I have to stick with the game to have them though. Feels rewarding. 

I wrote a lot about the greatest current hindrances of the game and while I could go on to write more to balance out with the best aspects of the game, this is already extraordinarily long review so I will cease to write more. Only to say to there are a LOT of wonderful aspects of the game like pacing, the story is intriguing, rewarding, I think it has good balance. 

It's worth the buy.

The experience is made up almost entirely of urgency, deficiency, and confusion. I'm refunding it almost immediately because it was honest to god stressful, until I maxed the ""coziness"" setting, which made it merely dull. Here are some of the cozy features you can look forward to if you pay money for this game:

You will be assaulted nightly (every few minutes) by bugs that attach themselves to your devices and crops and, along with some invasive alien bush-type things, have to be actively defended against with bug spray. The spray doesn't last very long and must be re-crafted. You can turn up the ""coziness"" setting to keep them from actively attacking devices, but they will still spawn and propagate and have to be managed. For some reason you can pick them up, but doing so damages you each second.

You will have essentially no inventory space and constantly have to return to storage boxes (I needed at least two within the first 15 minutes, meaning I was picking up at least 20 different types of materials). Everything you need to craft requires several different components, meaning constant juggling of items. 

Two of the most common crafting materials, planks and metal, can only be carried one at a time—on your character model as opposed to in inventory slots, much like The Forest—and have to be ferried back to wherever you're using them before you can pick up another.

You'll only ever be starving. I managed to stave off death by spamming actual leaves for 1 hunger point each, but this was satisfying to neither my character nor me. If I picked leaves off every bush in the area I'd still hover at 25% or so. You can use a campfire to make prepared food, but the most basic recipe requires the constant addition of planks for fuel (see above) and 3 different components that are not easy to come by. 

The play area is littered with hideous environmental pieces that you can't interact with without several different additions or upgrades to your equipment, which are gated behind resource grinding. Very similar to Dysmantle, except in a tiny area you're stuck in as opposed to a large world you get to explore.

Every mission objective I ran into involves running back to your workbench to craft a bunch of stuff (make sure you remember your shopping list; the log won't tell you) and then having to install it to progress. You never just get to... I don't know, explore and do things. It's VERY reminiscent of cell phone games that lock progress behind grindy crafting but without the option to ""pay to unlock now."" 

As soon as you make your workbench, you'll be overwhelmed by dozens of crafting recipes you can't make but must still sift through to find the ones you can and must. Many of these will be tiered, i.e. ""make this thing so you can use it to make this other thing."" 


Keep in mind these are all things I encountered in the first half hour. 

It's possible that you could still enjoy this if you're into survival games generally, since it's pretty comparable to a lot of those. But it's distinctly un-cozy. The developer has tried to preserve survival games' sense of ""just barely making it"" in order to try to be interesting, but this is so detrimental to the ""cozy"" half it's a design failure on the most basic level. I imagine a lot of my complaints would ease as you get farther into the progression, but that doesn't particularly matter; it makes just about the worst possible first impression. Cozy games and survival games alike are increasingly crowded genres, and I strongly urge everyone to give this one a pass in favor of other, better examples.",1691712219,1691712269,False,2,0,0.51737666130065918,1,True,False,True

I gets better and better and after some hours you feel like you have achieved something.
The gameplay loop is good enough with grinding some ressources, do some fishing, go on exploration and loot some stuff.

Great and totally addicting game. Cozy, relaxing, and fun. I expected it to be longer tho, but it's early access and cheap enough, so no problem.

There's room for improvement:

- The water thing. The bucket needs wider capacity (or at least the chance to upgrade it) abd a water deposit has to be a building option that you can fill with dirty water and can connect to sprinklers. Otherwise getting water it's too tedious due to the loading screen.

- Log and sheetmetal load capacity should start at 2. The log and sheetmetal storages should allow to take many items by holding the left mouse button.

- More, wider and upgradable storages for logs and sheetmetal. Methacrylate storage needed. Better management allowed on the assistant bots (they shouldn't just stack items wherever they felt like it...)

- There seems to be a bug when transfering items to storage. Some times the quantities don't add up correctly.

- Foods could offer temporary bonuses.

- Run option by holding shift. Running should deplete hunger bar faster.

It took me 9 hours to complete the Early Access content (story). The price point lines up perfectly with the content currently available. I could continue to build/plant etc... but without a particular goal there is no point. 

That said, it was a lot of fun. Everything is locked behind various pieces of technology and some exploration. Figuring out where to get X part to upgrade Y station so you can make Z part to upgrade something else is the trick of it all. 

By the end I had 3 robots running around, 2 collecting stuff and 1 building stuff. I had zero power issues and zero resource issues. Two of the machines I never even used (the big part maker and the other recycle type machine). 

There is a mod you can get mid way through the game (in the tower) that lets you link all your storage together which made inventory management 10 times easier. 

The music plays on a loop but its not bad and matches the overall asthetic of the game. 

I think for this game to really be popular its going to need to expand on the building part of it a LOT. Let players build wierd/massive forts or whatever.

The first 6 hours or so was more addictive than enjoyable. Once you get some helper bots and charger set up you feel a little relief but it wasn't almost until 8 hours when I could totally clear the debris and move more freely that I felt it become enjoyable and wasn't constantly rushed. 

I love the concept but the game is tiny, about three times the starting area. I was hoping for going roof to roof exploring a city, you have none of that. They have different button press combinations for using different tools which adds some flavor. The fishing minigame is just boring. Also until things open up maybe 8 hours in it's almost completely on rails linear. There is no clever use of resources or smart placement for stuff it's clear everything you can, unlock tool, clear a little more, unlock tool, clear a little more. It felt like going through a visual novel. 

Playing on Linux experienced one crash, some graphical stutter, the printer regularly just stops for seemingly no reason and you have to go press resume, and the helper bots regularly glitch out and get caught on each other which you're able to talk to them for or need to charge and don't go to the charger which I've had to restart to fix. Assuming none of those are platform specific.

Automation is nonexistant. The helper bots are a blessing in that they'll pick stuff off the ground and put it in chests but if you have chests organized they ignore that and will mix up all your stuff which you're having to go through and re-manage which is frustrating.

The worst part of the first 6 hours was the plants and fetching water though. They need water for every growth cycle so you take a bucket through a loading screen to the water below, fill it with salt water, another loading screen back up, put a plank on the fire, scroll to the very bottom of the list for salt water to water recipe, click it, go to the plants and click the bucket icon one at a time and it's only three uses of water so if you have 8 plants you're doing this about 3 times every day. 

There is some good stuff here but I think it needs alot more development before i'd recommend buying it but hopefully they add a lot more content and maybe even redo some of the bad systems like hunger and fishing.",1691640971,1691641166,False,86,2,0.766611158847808838,8,True,False,True

I will say this game doesn't disappoint! For a moderately chill fun survival jaunt around the desolate rooftop that our survivor finds themselves on is both a enjoyable and addicting experience for my game library. Similar games like Raft and other survival resource games prepared me for this style of game. While I will admit at first 14.99 for a early access game for me as a college student is a little pricey the 10% offer I got this for along with having some extra cash lying around left this be a fairly reasonable purchase for my library. 

Now I will admit not everything here is all shine and rainbows. the game is still in early access and it shows from ,<Empty String> tags filling in gaps of unavailable drone map locations to other occasional missing lines of text that only starts the cracks to form. Overall the system of drones left much to be desired, without a tutorial or someone like me willing to stick with this game many people will probably forgo the use of the drones for resource collection and instead use them for wood and metal collection. 

I am not to the end just yet but it is closing in sight with my nearly  26 - 30 hours of game play so far. I also see hope for where this game appears to be going. With new items and methods of material collection on the horizon not to mention new tools and the obvious plans for story and area exploration expansion I see this game really going places as more updates arrive. Not to mention having played the demo I know there are several characters that have yet to be introduced and there is still more for us to experience and unravel as the game grows and one day perhaps exits early access. 

Some CONS:

- The tile mechanics of designing and organizing your base is annoying at times with the inability to seal gaps between certain roof areas being a core problem with items like the resource generator, and the drone recharge ports. 
- As a result areas become difficult to power in the late game with only two really useful methods of obtaining things like batteries, matrixes, and modules. Being from drone exploration (limited), fishing (time consuming and rng based), and careful resource stockpile management. 
- I also think the score of music could improve with more options. 
1) the over world music is eventually very repetitive and slowly drives me insane with lack of variation,
2) The fishing area's music isn't so bad being adjacent to lo-fi, or simple instrumental. (However again it is repetitive)
3) Foley sound wise everything sounds great and makes sense for the environment 
4) I will admit I think some form of voice acting would be wonderful for the three companion bots so far. The warbled beeping and whirs are often boring or lack any emotional impact even when more interesting dialogue and story information is being presented.

In Conclusion:
I have had a wonderful time thus fair and most of my issues stem from symptoms of being in early access which I believe and hope will be ironed out in the final version of the game. 
I experienced no game breaking bugs or issues with the exception of the tight and awkward terrain boundaries making it hard to place larger constructs.

You can only carry 1 plank/metal/etc. at a time and considering that some buildings take 30+ plank/metal/etc. that means that you have to run to-and-fro for LITERALLY MINUTES, to pick up the wood or whatever from different parts of the map to bring it to the building. I spent 8minutes JUST RUNNING with materials back-and-forth to build 1 bridge building... and that 8minutes doesn't even include the time sawing/collecting the materials necessary for this 1 building, that's JUST running, since you can only carry 1 at a time.

I don't even like Dysmantle, and in fact, my review for Dysmantle on steam is negative, but even despite that, I'd recommend Dysmantle over this game BY FAR. 'Dysmantle' and even 'Beyond Contact' are games in this genre that I consider 'not good' but both of those blow 'I Am Future' out of the water when it comes to playability and valuing the player's time. This game is just far too obtuse to be playable. The game COULD be playable and maybe even recommendable if cons #1, 2, 3 and 6 were fixed, but without that, this game gets two thumbs down from me. I'll revisit the game upon release.

Some QoL features are also added to make for an overall superior experience. The feeling of ""wasting time on overly repetitive tasks"" is quickly remedied and further more as you progress.

A handful of notes: This consumes a lot of battery on the Steam Deck. Not sure why, I've fiddled with every setting in-game and out and you'll get about an hour and a half of gameplay max. Also the fans are almost consistently on high rpm. I haven't seen this with many other major titles (Dead Island 2/Dying Light 2 didn't do it). There is no CURRENT controller support (work in progress from the Devs). 

I've mapped a decent controller config (""I AM CONTROLLER"").

Also one thing that frustrates me to no end is having to move the character and then click on everything I want them to do. It's like Diablo meets Dysmantle but I can't mouse-click where I want to move to and there's no button to interact with what's in front of the character. It's a weird design choice.

Adding right click to move character or left click to move to/interact with an object instead of the distance radius saying I'm too far away (when I'm like a foot away from the circle its annoying).

Overall it's fun. I'm enjoying the entire vibe of the game and will definitely keep it and track it's updates. Give it a go, worst case is you'll want a refund. I think within an hour you'll know if it's for you.",1691616197,1691616680,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,True

[h1]Pros: [/h1]
+ Almost all abandoned/organic objects are some form of loot, and the map is just filled with them. The adventure component can come fun at first, trying to unlock new devices to collect. It can get a little too tedious and grindy later though.

+ A toggle to cater people who often experience motion sickness from these genres.
Motion sickness from these adventure/survival game usually comes from your brain not getting synced in with the motions displayed on the screen, played first-person. This is actually an aspect that many game developers opt to neglect for better experience to those who don't have motion sickness (i.e. I had to refund a couple of titles because of that). 
The main character you play is in third-person, and at the very beginning the game even tells you there is a motion sickness toggle to even reduce any of the quirky screen movements. I appreciated how mindful the game was to people with motion sickness.

+ Postapocalytpic survival of a cyberpunk society.  A lot of it is about dismantling and upcycling trash, like plastics, old couches, microwaves etc.

+ Some good amount of cutsomizability in terms of interior of your base, but not the actual landscape to any measure.

+ Not too many bugs, but there are some (elaborated below)

[h1] Cons: [/h1]
- A repetitive game loop of eat/kill bugs at night that run towards your farm ( as there is no meaningful way to fend off, other than placing torches as bait for them to attack those instead (which also do corrode away eventually)/ Grind for raw materials to unlock new devices, which then makes you grind for much more (as there isn't any other activity to do other than that and modifying layouts for your base). I am 5.5 hours in right now, and already feel like I am done with the grinding, because there isn't much else to do, and further exploration requires grinding existing materials.

-Some parts of the game just look like 2D flash game, such as the drone exploration map, but I am not too bothered by it, since it doesn't take up really a big chunk of the game loop.

- Moving and combining items from your toolbar to those inside the chest is a complete gamble, because it's bugged. Sometimes it works, sometimes your mouse icon is replaced with that item and never wears off. It requires you to change the map to make that item come back to show normally on your tool bar. 

[h1] Further Comments: [/h1]
* Hp bar kind of serves no purpose, which you can refill by sleeping and will only deteriorate by getting attacked by poisonous plants or by trying to pick up cybernetic bugs instead of spraying them with insecticide. 


* You only get one watering can that waters 3 times iirc. Once the water is out, you have to go down stairs for sea water, come back up, desalinate it with one-click before another three goes. While you do unlock sprinkler mid-game, not so convenient in the beginning.

[h1] Conclusion:[/h1]
The gameloop feels like a big 3D flash game, with a splash of customization by allowing you to move around and place objects the way you want, and by switching up your looks from very occasional cosmetic drops that you get throughout your gameplay. The game almost has no RNG implemented, which is actually very rare in this genre, and can come both as refreshing and confusing to older players of this genre. Even your loots for fishing are predetermined by the baits, and the rest of the loots from dissecting the existing objects are already determined in the game. The game also is mindful of and is friendly towards population who do get motion sickness from this genre. Moreover, the game is still in EA phase, so it has more room to flesh out. I am going to revisit the game once another major update rolls in, and modify the review as seen necessary.",1691571085,1691609113,True,3,0,0.500872611999511719,0,True,False,True

The main emphasis of the game is crafting and deconstructing.  You will be spending a lot of time working your way up the tech tree to clear more and more salvage from your rooftop home.  The stuff you get from all this salvaging is then put to use in making useful buildings and upgrades.  Some are more useful then others. 

For example the AI drones you can build have three roles you can give them.  Collection, where they pick up the hordes of trash you leave all over the rooftops and then stick it into the nearest empty chest, without giving a crap about stacking items.  Building, where they build the one or two items you tell them to and sit around doing nothing.  Or Engineering, where they refill the machines, but mostly refill the power generators.  That last one is the most useful but never needed more then one droid. 

Advancing in the tech tree is fun.  And getting access to a new tool or upgrade is satisfying.  As it allows you to expand more and more.  Running out of a resource feels bad but a fishing trip will easily get you back on track. Cooking in this game is intuitive and rewarding.  While I never felt like I was being punished for not cooking, the gains from doing so made it worth my time.  To unlock a recipe you need to combine ingredient in the chef tab.  The game doesn't punish you for experimenting but most of the recipes are logical.  How do I make a patty for my burger?  Cook the meat in some fat. How do I make coffee?  Combine the coffee beans with drinkable water.  And some of the recipes build on one another.  For example that coffee can be combined with Almond Milk to make a Latte. 

The combat system isn't the focus of the game.  There are huge flowers that spawn in worms at night that will try to spread puss spewing bushes.  At the start you will be crafting a weed spray to kill the worms and bushes.  At around the mid point of the game you will just craft barricades to keep them contained and repair them once every few days.  These enemies will drop stuff that you will need, ink for blueprints, slime for more weed spray and bait for fishing.  But once they are contained they are not a problem anymore. 

The story is a nice garnish on the game.  You will be encountering people in the game who will help your amnesic main character understand his part in this apocalypse he finds himself in.

The crafting is simplistic, but not lazy. The exploration limitation is done very nice by you needing to upgrade your tools to clear the trash and objects blocking your way. The enemy threats are not too demanding of your attention, but do need to be dealt with and give a nice balance between fending them off and being able to explore and craft.

a few QoL things I would love to see
1-The ability to delete items you have built. Not just the blueprint you have put down, but a fully built structure
2-A sprint ability 
3-Able to pin more than one recipe to the top so you can see what you need to collect for crafting

Also, every time you catch something the camera wildly swings around for a close-up of the player character, which I found very irritating. Farming is functional, but trying to protect the crops from the bugs gets tiresome fast, so I just turned on the ""cozy"" mode which prevents them from harming crops while I explore.

I didn't experience any glitches or bugs or anything like that. It's got partial voice acting, great sound effects and music.
