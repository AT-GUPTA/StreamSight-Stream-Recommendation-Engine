Pros:
Decent graphics
Decent amount of car collection
Okayish story line
Can play with your friends in a custom lobby
 
Cons:
Still has some bugs / exploits
Upgrading system is just a gacha role, which is btw a nightmare
Micro transaction (Not much of a big deal but you progress slower without spending money, which I didn't do so)
Multiplayer is dead (Not many public lobbies are available)

The Good
It has a linear storyline. Even though it’s not good, at least it is something. Also, the voice acting is pretty bad.

The graphics are good.


The Bad
The game uses high CPU!

There is a randomized card system for parts. Even though I think the gameplay aspects to this is good, I personally just want to buy parts and get a better vehicle. I can only expect that the cards play a bigger part later in the game when doing higher leveled missions, which I am not going to do. I just wanted a good story involving fast cars.

Looking for the main quest on the map was hard for me to do. There were so many icons and none of them said that they were the story mission. One was locked off until you did something else. There are recommended levels for missions and that makes me feel like the game is grindy.

The mission that I had to do, had requirements to progress the story. I hate that crap. Time limit, high points, or whatever, just leave it out for main missions…

There was no way to turn off the vibration on the controller. 

The game and ea apps obviously want to collect data.


Conclusion
It’s not a bad game and I was having an okay time with it. It’s just, I was watching a person play La noire yesterday, and while playing need for speed payback, I kept thinking how I would rather play la noire than this. Something with a clear and linear story with no bs.

Main game (story mode):
The game has great graphics for 2017, the police car crash camera is very cool and i really like it, the cars have awesome customization, the story is really well made and i enjoy it the game also is full of action.

Multiplayer (online):
In 2024 the online servers are almost dead and you will find a session very hard, i only ever played online once and the people there are very chill and you can enjoy it whit friends.
Some additional stuff i like: The game can run on a pretty bad computer, you can run it on 8 GB of ram just fine if you disable some programs in your system.
Even if you finish the game you can go around and relax while driving across the map.
You can play this game whit out a mouse.

Things i don't like:
The voice lines feel a bit weird like they are made by AI.
I don't like that the only way to get vanities is by getting it whit a shipment pack because you will never know what you might get.
The multiplayer is a complete joke, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR MULTIPLAYER, multiplayer just feels like a bonus to the game not an actual game mode. The main problem is that you can't find people to race whit anymore since as i mentioned earlier the game is kind of dead, if you really wanna race you might want to get some friends to play whit.
EA Launcher is very, very bad, i hate it and i wish you would not need it to be able to run the game.
The controls are really really weird so please just change them.

Whit all of this being said i enjoy this game and i like it so i rate it a 8.5/10.

The game in 2024 is worth it just if it is on sale, i bought it for 2.99 Euro, full price is not worth it anymore.

NFS 2015 has better drifting heck any other nfs has better drifting. Turning Sensitivity can be changed on Race Builds but Drift Builds can't change the turning sensitivity which is stupid because the speed at how sharply you can turn directly affects how quick and smooth you can initiate a drift its funny because this feature you could change in NFS 2015 with the Differential and Weight balance of the car actually had more impact on how drifty your car is and you can't actually get good parts out of the shops. You need part tokens later in the game to actually make your cars acceleration and speed stats go up. Because the game will skimp you on those and when you trade in parts that are useless you only get 1/3 needed to actually get 1 roll so you either buy all the useless parts in the shop and trade them in if you buy all 10 or so it'll be 200,000+ maybe which you grinded for and could've saved for buying a new car instead you need to roll and gamble for the ""right parts"" And the Free drops they give you you'll maybe have like 70-80 part tokens giving you 30+ rolls but eventually you'll need different cars for every different 6 styles of event and you'll lose all of them trying to get your cars to a decent level anyway it's just too fucking grindy and a waste of time and money why even bother just play the old need for speeds that don't need to hold you by the wallet to progress.

Regardless, I gave it a whirl with an xbox controller and (unlike rivals) found it quite fun.  I think it's the story element and not having to either purposely crash into other cars, or be evading the police.
It means my ineptitude of driving with a controller isn't punished so hard.
I'm also liking the progression and the mini sub games - like collecting the tokens and billboards.  Having said that, I had to look up what the hell the billboards were all about cos the game didn't tell me I had to crash through them.  Also discovered the trick of engaging random racers on the street quite by driving alongside and trying just about every button until I beeped the horn and something happened.  Dunno why this stuff can't be explained in game cos it certainly isn't intuitive - especially as a newbie to xbox controllers.

I reviewed this on my Curator page before I ever played this game and it just reaffirmed that origin DRM on top of Steam's DRM is just bulls*it. The game itself is just mediocre that spews out the same NFS storylines that EA has been using since the early 00's. I only play this because it is a mindless racing arcade.

There are aspects to this game that make you scratch your head such as the main complaint to seemingly everyone, the slot machine style performance upgrade system. Though this system is heavily flawed and makes upgrading RNG dependent, I would be lying if I said it doesn't make maxing out your car a little more satisfying. Another common complaint is the race class system which basically forces you to buy a separate car for each event type; race, offroad, drag, drift, and runner. Annoying? A little. But not a deal breaker to me. Outside of this, the main story line was pretty solid for a racing game. Corny here and there as you'd expect but likable characters that don't make it unbearable.

Good:
-Wide variety of different race types which lets you drop a certain type of race if you get bored with it and go try another type for a while.
-Drifting is amazing, I wish they had doubled the drifting events in the game.
-Story is alright, the characters try too hard to be unique but overall it works.
-The ""gambling"" theme that everything has is cute
-You gamble for parts which fits into the theme which has obviously not gone over well, but a lot of people don't understand that basically individual parts don't matter, when you gamble you are guaranteed to get something better than what you have currently.  Also, they give you shipments which gives you over 100 rolls to get parts.  I'm not defending this but it does fit into the theme and they removed this in future titles.
-Police pursuits are fun and challenging, they have a bunch of tricks you have to watch out for.  The police are aggressive in this game but not as much as NFS Heat.

Bad:
-The offroad physics are garbage and are quite literally unplayable with a few tracks late in the game as the entire track is much too thin and you will slide into rocks and lose the race instantly as there is no catch-up so offroad is tiptoeing over eggshells and very very much not fun.  Plus this game is literally obsessed with them.  The last entire offroad league is trash for this reason and they should have gone with another drift league instead.  I put an hour into one race  on restart attempts before I decided to stop wasting my time and turn the game down to easy just for that race.
-The Outlaw's Rush (the big final race the game teases you about the entire game) is absolutely not special at all
-The story events are much too cinematic and feel like slightly interactive set pieces
-While the city is well thought out and has lots of jumps and shortcuts, the offroad sections feel like a whole lot of nothing, real empty world.
-The fact that you have to make ""builds"" for each race type even though nothing about the car is unique to it is stupid, but they do give you more than enough parts, and I understand if they didn't do this then you'd just grind your starter car and not ever experience 99% of the cars they bothered to put in the game

A much improved racing game compared to 2015's effort in pretty much all aspects. Loading is much faster, characters are at least [i]somewhat[/i] likable now, there's a huge variety in main events and side activities, and overall it's simply far more polished. Yes it does have some blemishes here and there and it's also very by-the-numbers, taking a page out of Burnout Paradise's book that popularized this approach to open-world racers, but otherwise  [i]Payback[/i] is a surpisingly robust entry in the franchise. 

For an arcade title the handling model is very competent and further expressed in how the different styles of cars control. This offers a distinct feeling of racing from event to event. Whether you're doing off-road, drag racing, drifting, speed runs or escaping from the cops they all have their own category of eligible cars and make it so there's a high variety in gameplay which forces you to play with multiple vehicles (as opposed to cruising through the campaign with just one that you've tuned up for everything). The only annoyance being that when you are trying to snag up some collectibles on certain terrain your car doesn't handle well you're better off going back to the garage to swap out your ride.  

Speaking of variety, the open-world itself also holds up in this regard what with its sprawling off-road terrain that ranges from lush green backwoods to dusty canyons. There's a city center that's full of casinos and high rises and on the outskirts you've got smaller towns dotted around that evoke pure Americana; all complete with landmarks and places to explore. It's all really well done and give the game an identity and personalty, something that was missing from the 2015 title. That said, there's also vast stretches of desert between all of the main hubs that basically has no points of interest whatsoever so don't go expecting Burnout Paradise or Forza Horizon levels of activity density in that respect. 
 
As far as downsides go is that despite the story and characters being a step up from the previous game (which isn't saying much, admittedly) the voice acting can be [i]very[/i] hit and miss. The same goes for the music choices that feature some of the most milquetoast Indie Blues/Rock imaginable. The type you'd hear in commercials or sizzle reels that aim to be as inoffensive as possible and evoke no feeling whatsoever. You'd argue this is subjective but the entire soundtrack almost sounds like a royalty free affair. Pure background noise. And in a racing game you'd ideally get some blood pumping tracks across all genres but [i]Payback[/i] is extremely lacking here. If EA wanted to cheap out on song licensing then it definitely shows (ironically in the previous game I couldn't actually hear the soundtrack due to a bug but in this one I turned it off myself).  

Another issue I have is that the upgrading system is kind of awkward. Instead of outright buying the parts you want for each category you instead have to contend with a card system that has a certain factor of randomness thrown in as well. It's akin to something like FIFA Ultimate Team and makes actual upgrading an unnecessary hassle. Upon receiving a part (or ""speed card"") you can then either equip it, send it to your garage, sell it for cash or trade it in and while this does offer some choice I just found it cumbersome at the best of times.  

Otherwise though Payback is a step in the right direction. Yes it's all rather formulaic so your mileage may vary depending on whether or not you have the stomach for yet another open-world racer of this ilk (with a heavy emphasis on story). But for me it's been one of the more enjoyable racing games I've played in the series. The visuals are great, the driving feels good for the most part, and along with the surprisingly solid technical performance it's also been a mostly bug free experience for me as well. 

Considering the fact that this deluxe edition regularly goes on sale for a criminally low 3 Euro (Activision take note) it's been incredible value for money and thus an easy recommend.",1708128388,1708129966,True,4,2,0.580419540405273438,4,True,False,False

Everything I heard about this game from players before finally pulling the trigger and buying it myself were entirely negative and I can't really put my finger on why. Sure the story makes no sense and the characters aren't terribly likable, but they're a lot more likable than the ""people"" in Unbound, but are you really playing Need For Speed for the story or characters in the first place?

The visuals are fantastic even on low settings, as are the cutscenes. The car roster is really good and the visual customization is plentiful. The driving physics themselves leave a lot to be desired, it's extremely difficult, even with maxed steering sensitivity tuning, to just take a corner without hitting either wall or both. It's got better drifting physics than Unbound but it's far worse than a proper drift build on NFS Heat. The upgrade system is interesting and doesn't just revolve around grinding for money to afford the next part you unlocked, however it's not exactly a realistic system. The map is bigger than Heat and quite varied. The visual mods are unlocked through various things that happen naturally by just playing the game in freeroam, not a level up system or per-race like the other modern NFS games. It's not a live service (though some features require a brief connection to the internet which is a downside), so far I haven't been bombarded with MTX advertisements and I haven't been presented with content the base game didn't include like NFS Most Wanted 2012 did CONSTANTLY.

A minor nag I have is that the Nissan R35 GTR's exhaust note is terrible. It sounds like the trumpety VQ engines Nissan used in the 350z, 370z, G35 and G37 and those cars are memes in the car world for having an annoying exhaust note. The R35's VR38 engine sounds nothing like these, and this annoying sound makes the GTR unpleasant to drive. Annoyingly, the 350z doesn't use this exhaust note either, making the cars sound like their engines are swapped with one another. The Infiniti Q60 doesn't sound like the GTR either despite using variations on the same VR engine. The G35/G37 is only a pedestrian car, but it doesn't sound like this either.

The only issues I've had with this game so far was controller support issues caused by owning the game on Origin instead of Steam, and since buying the game on Steam, my PS4 controller works perfect, even has pressure sensitive triggers and dynamic joysticks despite saying it wouldn't unless I had an XBOX controller. Let that be a lesson to all; if you buy a game on Origin/EA App, it's not guaranteed to have full controller support, but if buy that same game on Steam, you can force the controller to work with very minimal effort.

The other issue I've encountered is that the game isn't very well optimized. I have to sit somewhere between Low and Medium despite having an RTX 2070 Super and that's just not okay.

Otherwise the game is fantastic! Personally I'd wait for a sale, it's not quite worth $30,",1705873590,1707943775,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The handling sucks. I know it's arcade handling, but I feel racing games should at least retain some realism in the handling, or at the very least you should be able to get the car to where you want it to go. This is just an understeering, perma brake fading, handbrake engine stalling simulator.
The story is boring and has really weird pacing, right from the get-go. And the voice acting is fucking terrible. I feel bad being this brunt but DAMN, is it bad. I've seen low-to-no budget parody videos on youtube with better voice acting than this.
The graphics may look decent for 2017. I don't remember many games from that era, but I can at least tell you that they haven't aged very well. Running at max settings still renders stuff like decals extremely blurred. Not to mention that everything looks like it's made of shiny play dough. Won't comment more than this on the graphics because of what I said at the start on this topic, though I'm sure I could find a similarly scaled game without these problems.

At risk of sounding like another 2005-era NFS fan: EA, please just remaster Most Wanted 2005 and Carbon. Or yet, don't! I'm sure you'd probably manage to fuck that up too.

If you, the reader, are debating getting this for 3€ on sale like I did, maybe check some other games first and buy this if you find nothing else. At any higher of a price, just skip it.",1707780651,1707780651,False,6,1,0.53291088342666626,2,True,False,False

Review:

Need for Speed Payback delivers an adrenaline-fueled experience that will leave racing enthusiasts on the edge of their seats. As a longtime fan of the Need for Speed franchise, I was eagerly anticipating this latest installment, and I can confidently say that it did not disappoint.

One of the standout features of Payback is its captivating storyline. Set in the fictional Fortune Valley, players are immersed in a world of underground racing, betrayal, and revenge. The narrative is engaging, filled with unexpected twists and turns that kept me hooked from start to finish. The characters are well-developed, each with their own motivations and personalities, adding depth to the overall experience.

The gameplay itself is nothing short of exhilarating. Whether tearing through the streets in high-speed pursuits or competing in intense races, every moment behind the wheel is filled with excitement. The controls are responsive and intuitive, allowing for precise maneuvers and hair-raising stunts. Customization options are also extensive, allowing players to personalize their vehicles to suit their style and preferences.

Visually, Need for Speed Payback is stunning. The sprawling open world of Fortune Valley is beautifully rendered, with detailed environments and breathtaking vistas. From neon-lit cityscapes to sun-drenched deserts, each location feels distinct and immersive.

Multiplayer mode adds another layer of excitement to the experience, allowing players to compete against friends and rivals from around the world. Whether collaborating in cooperative races or going head-to-head in intense showdowns, there's never a dull moment online.

Overall, Need for Speed Payback is a triumphant addition to the franchise, delivering heart-pounding action, gripping storytelling, and breathtaking visuals. With its compelling gameplay and extensive customization options, it's a must-have for any racing fan. Strap in, rev your engines, and get ready for the ride of a lifetime.

[hr][/hr]
[b][u]Story[/u]:[/b] It has a plot that feels pretty generic however like NFS games, its story is just the moving factor to keep us engaged. But I am still impressed with the work they did with this generic plot.

[b][u]Graphic and Presentation[/u]:[/b] Definitely there is improvement in visual and open world is largely fun to run with. I did have certain problem with the off road object placements where the feel of speed is obstructed by some objects around the corner breaking the feel of simulated action scene.

[b][u]Events[/u]:[/b]  Has regular events for Race and Off-road - Sprint, Circuit, Drag and Drift. DLC has SpeedCrossx which is StreetX from Underground 2 but done with more action and speed. Additionally there is Non race events which is more mission/task oriented. I like the wager system to boost the pocket in each race when completing a random objective in an event. I tried multiplayer for the sake of achievements only hence cannot comment on it much.

[b][u]Activities[/u]:[/b] Additional solo activities include Speed run, Speed trap, Drift Zones and Jumps. There are rival activities like roaming racer similar to NFS UG2 but with aggression levelled up after beating a racer resulting in better reward. Crates mission are fun since its simply a trigger that initiates a pursuit.

[b][u]Collectables[/u]:[/b] Like Most wanted 2013, we have Billboards to smash and There are around 100 gambles chips scattered around the map. I hated the placements for most part as our ride has to go through specific speed to reach it i.e. if over-speed, will miss it which is a bad design for a game focused on speed.

[b][u]Soundtrack[/u]:[/b] I think people who complain about NFS soundtracks are from my generation as our childhood and teenage years were filled with experience of those wonderful OSTs that we keep comparing every NFS games with those. I think Payback has decent Soundtrack and the way they play-out depending on the type of event is a good design although i still think there could have been improvement in deciding the OSTs.

[b][u]Cars and Customisation[/u]:[/b] Collection of cars are impressive and different types based on event like Prostreet are brought back. Parts customisation is bit short in terms of options as compared to prior NFS but still not bad. Visual customs are highlight where I would spend a lot of time. I like the feature of sharing our custom design with the community and using the ones that was shared by other. Although it is disappointing that certain customisation like tyre smoke, neon are loot boxes.

[b][u]Pursuit[/u]:[/b] Pursuit is not as interesting as MW but is still fun to play. Think of Marked man event from Burnout paradise. You just have to get from point A to B. That's it, pursuit ends around 80% of the event completion. Also, Pursuit is limited to events only which is ok considering open world activity in this game.

[hr][/hr]
[b][u]Overall experience[/u]:[/b] I think this is a good NFS game that gives great sense of speed. Although the story and chapters are short, the activities will keep us engages in it for better part of the playtime. There is a huge margin for improvement like objectives in race must not hinder with speed but rather encourage to go flying. Definitely a good game from NFS series as I had a sense of satisfaction  playing this game.",1707664658,1707664847,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is awesome people :) I am finally getting a chance to play the Need for speed game I sadly missed and I really sad I missed it. I can already say that this game is awesome I like the idea of you having to do jobs in Need For Speed it feels like Need For Speed but also a bit Fast and The Furious like and I do like that :) I am really looking forward to play this game some more but let me start off by saying that I am already in love with it, can't wait to find a little more time for it.

        [td]💾Graphics[/td]
        [td]In terms of visuals, this game is really beautiful and still holds up well today. The image is really sharp and I'd go so far to say that it even looks sharper than Need For Speed: Heat! Not saying the graphics are better, but the image sharpness is superior. The UI is minimal and really clean and the car models look incredible! The character models also don’t look bad at all. The character’s don’t look next gen, but they still hold up pretty well. The texture and lighting are really impressive and still look superb, which is great to see.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎮Gameplay[/td]
        [td]The car physics are pretty decent, not great but decent. The driving physics/handling work well with the map design (unlike NFS 2015) so no complaints there. The car customization is still as impressive as ever, but with some minor flaws. The stancing system had seen a downgrade. You can’t space your tires out anymore so many widebody or widened fenders will have bad fitment. Besides that the car customization is pretty good and I like that you unlock parts by doing some challenges. I prefer this over the NFS 2015 leveling system because it’s much faster to unlock these parts and feels rewarding. The tuning system is not in the game anymore because they decided to make you focus on different race types with different cars. Now you need to have a street car, drift car, offroad car, drag car, etc. I did not like this system at first because I prefered to have one personal car (or two). Having to micro-manage 6-7 cars was annoying right off the bat, but it got easier when you started making more money and it was cool to see many focused car builds in the garage. The upgrading system is horrible. The only way to upgrade your car is by buying or earning cards. You can go to the tune shop and create your own upgrades by a slot machine type system, it’s a bit shady and a dumb upgrade mechanic that taints the game. The good thing is that it’s been fixed to make it less annoying. Luckily the game offers shortcuts to preinstalled tunes but you need to get further into the game to unlock these. There are microtransactions to make this easier, but not worth it since it’s not too grindy in my opinion. The races are really fun and feel all unique. The offroad races are actually my favorite (and the street races). It’s cool to see Need for Speed for some off-roading, and they did a pretty good job at it. The car roster is insane with so many amazing cars to drive and the map is so perfect for these types of races and fast cars. This is my favorite map in the Modern Need for Speed games (talking about NFS 2015, Heat, and unbound). It’s so well balanced and offers many great styles of racing. Also the AI are actually challenging and put up a good fight which was great to see and had a blast racing against them![/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]📜Story[/td]
        [td]The story was actually really fun. It’s not incredible by any means, but it was engaging and enjoyed that there were antagonists and a worthwhile plot. The characters are forgettable and uninteresting, but the story was a good switch up compared to Need For Speed 2015. The story did drag a bit too long in the later stages but overall it was pretty fun and a good improvement from the previous game.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🕛Playtime[/td]
        [td]The story is about 20+ of playtime but if you plan on exploring and getting everything completed it’s around 40+ hours. If you don’t plan on exploring the map or doing collectables then the replayability may be little to none here.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎧Sound[/td]
        [td]The vehicles sound absolutely incredible. Every car sounds unique from each other and is a joy to drive. I swear Need for Speed never disappoints with sound design. Sadly Need for Speed never mastered getting good voice actors because some of the acting is physically painful. The main protagonist was absolutely horrible and had one of the worst voice acting performances I ever heard in a video game. Also the music was kinda meh. Some soundtracks were decent, but most of them were just horrible.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]❗Bugs❗[/td]
        [td]I haven’t really seen any serious bugs in this game. The physics can act a bit buggy if you are sliding and hit a cop or wall. The textures may take a little bit to fully load up at times (I’m not on an SSD so that may be the culprit). Besides that I never haven't seen anything that stood out to me that was a bug.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🔅Performance[/td]
        [td]The performance for the most part was actually pretty solid. Max settings and had a solid 60 fps. I rarely had any frame drops. I did have stutters at times but those were pretty rare. The stutters may have been from me streaming so take that into consideration.[/td]

        [td]🔗Conclusion[/td]
        [td]Need for Speed Payback was a great improvement from the previous game released. Sadly they removed some great customization options and made some questionable gameplay changes. Despite that, the game was actually fun and I had a good time with it. The story was a joy and kept me engaged, the driving was fun and the map is amazing. Finally great to see a Need for Speed game come back with challenging AI, fantastic map, great customization, and more! I would have rated this higher but some changes they made did not benefit this game at all. It’s not as good as Need for Speed: Heat, but a great improvement from Need for Speed 2015. Give this game a try if you are looking for the fun arcade racer![/td]

It really depends because the story is just not great. It's like the new fast and furious, wanna be cool and shit. But what ever. The racing is good enough.

Just to clarify. I didn't pay the full price. And probably never would. Buy this game at a discount or something like that.

Now the racing is great, the cars to choose are wonderful, but I do miss some. As a JDM fan there are some cars missing, but I could live without them. 
The handling is super good UNTIL
1) you get to the offroad races. I hate them. They are really frustrating. One time you go straight and the other you just drift and can't control it. I can't really explain it, but it was painful.
2) You have to turn. When you race, and you have to take a sharp turn. (Basically the whole map is designed like that) you get slowed by 100%. and the AI just fly past you with the most perfect drift. So you just loose. I played on the hard mode so that mind be the reason. But when that happens you just need to restart the race. You won't win cuz you just ain't fast enough.

So this is my review. Buy it, but not at the full price. I'll for sure be coming back to get the 100%. But till then, have fun.

The map is large enough( maybe the biggest of the series) to host different landmarks or landscapes,from 
deserts to mountains and large valleys. 

The graphics are muddy but still looks good at maximum settings,the cars look good and especially at night everything looks better. 

Payback features a day and night cycle ,beautiful roads and a decent car amount to drive . The story is told through separate chapters from the perspective of three characters each with his own perks and discipline. 
The plot is focused on a revenge motif to take down the House ( the organization that controls casinos,cops and the underground racing in Fortune Valley) . 

In terms of story,i don't expect a lot from a racing game but i was surprised they actually tried to deliver a decent story. And for the most part they did. But unfortunately also felt linear and annoying.
I don't want to talk about the game ending or Lina Navarro,i'll let you discover.

At first glance the cops are annoying but in a good way( they do their job as intended). This provides a tense racing experience but i wish you could escape like in previous games.. now if you reach a checkpoint towards the end of the race they stop following you and the chase ends.. That alone is a major downside for the fun factor and gameplay experience.

On a closer look the game doesn't feel polish and original enough. Some elements and activities like drift zones or derelict cars are borrowed from other games . The car stealing and some cutscenes made me feel i was playing as Dominic Toretto  at times. 

I really liked how drifting experience felt in this game,with proper tweaks and car setup it's a pleasure to maintain the drifting line through difficult corners. 

Pros:
-simple driving mechanics
-very good drifting 
-the revving sounds amazing 
-the story is bad but when you search what racing genre has to offer ,you come back and give this another chance

Cons:
-Police chase ends when you reach a checkpoint
-missions/activities felt repetitive

I have played this game back in 2017 when it first came out. My review back then? Horrible, terrible even!
This is, in my personal opinion, the 2nd worse entry in the entirety of the Need for Speed Franchise. Everything this game offers it does so half baked or poorly executed. The open world it's not really open at all, the handling, whilst a improvement from it's predecessor (2015) it's still bad, the upgrade system and progression it's basically a slot machine, etc...
You might be wondering, why is the review positive then? What's changed since? Well...
THE MODDING COMMUNITY / SCENE!!!
One in specifically, UNITE Payback, truely makes this game worth a play.
UNITE Payback get's rid of everything wrong, bad, or incomplete in the game, adds upon, and offers even more content for the player to tackle.
If you got the game on a huge sale discount, or as part of the Need for Speed franchise bundle and have been hesitant on playing it, but wanted to get some value out of it - this is it.

   When I entered, I went through the tutorial and entered multiplayer and saw his Beetle, which was so fast that it beat me backwards (I was with the first car in the game), from that moment on, I decided that I was going to dedicate myself to this game and try to surpass my friend.
    I was never that interested in cars, but for some reason the Mazda Rx-7 always enchanted me, so when I saw it in the game, I bought it and started improving it as much as possible.
    After a while I finally managed to go head to head with the Beetle and in some moments even win. Until my friend lost his Playstation Plus and we couldn't play anymore.
    A few years passed and I felt like remembering this game and the experience I had. When I went to open the game, I realized that my data had been corrupted, I was very shaken, but over time I accepted the loss and started to have only good memories in my head.
    After a while, I see that this same game, which marked my life, was on sale, I couldn't contain myself and bought it. My friend unfortunately can't play with me anymore, but the experience and nostalgia are incredible! This game has one of the best racing game gameplays I've ever seen.

Open world means the world is...you guessed it. Open.
This is a pseudo-open world racer. You are confined to whatever the game has determined to be terrain. This restriction is present even in free roam.

Example: 
1. You see a winding mountain road and decide take a short cut through the bushes to a part of the track below. Access denied...reset.
2. Want to have some fun and air time off the mountain onto a clearly visible road below? Nope...reset.
3. Searching for collectibles and are one inch off your perfect landing...you guessed it. Reset.

I tend to experience this more outside the city. Hopefully a mod comes out that fixes this.

The characters are all forgettable along with the story. The only consolation for me was Mac.
Add the insane rubber banding, poor handling, weird customization and scripted chases and you have another expensive attempt at insanity.

Underneath all the issues there are fragments of fun to be found. Like derelict hunting, vehicle tuning and just cruising around. Race difficulty is tied to your vehicle level, and by the time you max out everything you'll be leaving the ai in the dust...except for the scripted races.

EA needs to stop trying to recreate one-trick ponies and instead understand what made previous games like Underground 2, Most Wanted 2005 and Hot Pursuit 2010 great. It was not the characters or the live action cut-scenes. it was the gameplay, game modes, vehicle handling, soundtrack and the overall experience.

[h1][b]Gameplay[/b][/h1]
It's... well, it's definitely a game in the franchise, that's for sure. It's a racing game, and its variety of race types is very satisfying. The location of the game, Las Vegas, also opens up many avenues for excitement and fun, with winding canyon roads and desert dunes to take on with a slew of different rides.

The core gameplay is tight and fun, moving you from one race to the next with little hesitation. The driving model is [i]good[/i] but not the best in the franchise, and races feel fine overall. Cars handle and sound different, and the events are all fun and challenging without ever being burdensome.

The upgrade system, however, is its fatal flaw. [i]EA[/i] decided to push their monetization as far as they could with this title. Upgrades are via a ""card"" system, which essentially boils down to a lootbox system. It doesn't take much time to run out of free in-game resources, leaving you with a subpar car and lackluster upgrades. It's frustrating, but the moment you're at your limit, the game is ready to tell you that you can skip this by spending real money.

It's gross, and the worst part of the game. Luckily, it can be ignored, as the upgrades are not essential to completing the game.

[h1][b]Story[/b][/h1]
Story-wise, the game is nothing special, but the franchise never has been. It has a cast of characters whose personalities are all... kinda ""we know what the kids like"" in nature, but it was never too much for me to listen to. It feels like an even more campy version of [i][b]Fast & Furious[/b][/i] at times, but that's not all that bad.

[h1][b]Performance[/b][/h1]
Performance-wise, the game runs... great, actually! Fantastic visuals, good performance, just about every graphical feature you'd like to have here, and I never had any performance issues. It's not perfect, but performance was never on my mind while playing.

[h1][b]Conclusion[/b][/h1]
Overall, [i][b]Need for Speed™ Payback[/b][/i] is a good racing game let down by egregious monetization in its upgrade system. It's still worth a play, it's just disappointing that it's let down only by a single, core aspect that could have easily been changed for something better.",1704859220,1704859220,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

[u]Pro (+)[/u]
-Map is huge and the diversity of the different areas/biomes is very good
-Fast travel to 33 different locations
-Optic tuning very nice and a lot to choose from
-Good amount of cars
-You get money kinda fast, so you can have multiple dream cars without grinding too much for it
-The driving and drifting feels really nice, you can do actually real NFS like driving and drifting which I enjoyed a lot
-Story is good and because of 6 different racing types it doesn't get boring
-There are no poorly made police chases outside the story, so you can just relax doing your races and activities
-The main missions of the story are replayable (and they are worth to replay!)
-Street racers and open world bosses, which are challenging to beat
-Car sounds are very nice

[u]Neutral (~)[/u]
-You need to buy the car for a certain type (like race/drag/drift), so if you want the same car for every type, you will need to buy it more than once
-The performance upgrade is partly made with a ""loot machine"" where you need coins to spin (you get coins easily), but it feels just wrong to have gambling for performance parts

[u]Contra (-)[/u]
-Multiplayer is dead, very hard to find an online lobby, mostly only if communicated over the steam forum beforehand
-You can buy coins for the ""loot machine"" to upgrade your performance faster
-If you want to add specific colors of nitro, tire-smoke or air suspension you need to open those lootboxes, to have a chance to get a random reward",1704723694,1704723694,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Really good game. I think it would be better if the dialogue was a bit better in terms of being original, because people tend to say the same things over and over with every boss. I think Jess could play a larger role in the effort to bring down the house. Racing 10/10. Drifting 8/10. Drag 4/10... could be so much more potential here... Runner 8/10. Xcross 6/10... pretty boring ngl... now with off-road, I usually don't like in many games, but this was pretty enjoyable. I think if drifting was initiated less in offroad because holy fucking shit all I was doing was sliding around, jesus christ. But anyway, I went full play through on medium difficulty and still enjoyed the game with some difficulty. One big critique would be making the world less restrictive. If I want to fucking full blast across the desert without slamming into indestructible rocks every 1/4 mile, I should be able to. Other than that, great game.

[quote]
⚖️ fMeter {A} Worth a play, if you enjoy Fast Upgrade & Quick Races. However, if you're looking for High Difficulty of Cop Pursuit, don't play it
[/quote]

[h1] 🕘          IMPRESSION:[/h1]
* 2017: Game released and I start observing
* 2019: Finally brought it from Origin store
* 2020: Still satisfied after 43 hours
* 2021: Very much better than NFS Heat
* 2022: Still loving it after 59 hours
* 63 hours later: Buy again on Steam account
* 0.1 hours later: Earned 36 steam achievements in 1 min because sync to my EA progress, steam people assume that I cheated

[h1]  🔊         TESTER MUST KNOW:[/h1]
* Require a CPU that's ok to use Steam + EA play at the same time
* Many improvement from previous NFS
* The cop only appear in Runner race
* Higher Risk Higher Reward in the career mode
* NPC racer will do mistake like human being
* Hangout = Free roam in Open World + Customize Race Route
* Speedcross = Mixture of Score Attack
* Vanity Item = Nitrous Color, Tire Smoke Color, Underglow & etc
* Common ""esc"" button for in-game menu is replaced by ""tab"" button
* Auto sync with EA account progress, if we buy on Steam

[h1] 💎         COMPARE TO OTHER NFS:[/h1]
* Route Setup in multiplayer
* A better world map
* More fast travel location
* Many options to upgrade a car
* Larger garage capacity
* More offroad racing
* Day and night cycle
* Vanity rewards available
* Better speedwall (friend leaderboard)
🎯 Compare to NFS Unbound & Heat ➜ [u][url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/expectationchecklist/discussions/2/4042609814927677500/]Show Me[/url][/u]

[h1] ⭐️         SAME GENRE COMPARISON:[/h1]
* Arcade handling
* Drag racing available, but just a few
* Diverse character respond base on player behavior
* Diverse visual customization on car
* Downloadable community car livery design

[h1]  ⚠️        RUMOR CHECKING:[/h1]
* Cannot play because no activation code ➜ There is no cd-key if we purchase on Steam
* Downgraded graphic from nfs 2015 ➜ nfs payback may look not photo-realistic but still high quality visual provided, and it performance faster than 2015
* No buy, it is pay to win ➜ That is optional, still win without any extra payment
* Repetitive grinding ➜ Not happening in 2019
* The cop is easy to escape ➜ Player have optional to changed to weaker car to challenge the cops

For a somewhat modern entry in an increasingly dying and progressively mediocre franchise, Payback does quite a lot of things right, even though it bears hallmarks of modern games like useless DLCs. The story is appropriate to this kind of game, with minimal amounts of forced cringe (like in heat) and somewhat likable characters. 

The side content is plentiful and the questing system is really cool. The game has some rpg elements, where you can exchange your parts if you don't want them and gain bonuses for upgrading the car accordingly. The game doesn't feel like an empty shell of mediocre that is supposed to be enriched with multiplayer, and the end product is a fun singleplayer experience

The only need for speed I really liked after that was NFS Hot pursuit  from 2010 but after that there was only trash  I haven,t played every need for speed because I know most of them suck because EA sucks  at making games nowadays All NFS games I played after 2010 I played for 2 h and refunded them because they all just suck  like Rivals / Heat /Most wanted Remake /Unbound ….. and so on 

Now from all of the modern NFS I think payback was the one that looked the best and has the best reviews so I  grabbed   it now on sale for 2.99 and lets see  

The car handling is just again what the hell    do you even know how car physics work EA  driving with 300 kp/h in a hairpin turn  and just hit space and you slide around it  your car is basically glued to the track you can take every turn with with full speed just hit space . You car can also break from 300kp/h to 0  or make a full U turn on full speed in like 1-2 sec mean EVEN GTA5  which is not even a racing game has WAYYYYY better car physics 

Besides there is absolutely no  damage on the cars in this game   I mean 0.0 you can drive with 400kp/h into a wall no scratch on your car  I mean I don,t expect a wreckfest but  at least  anything but there,s just NOTHING

They even put Microtransactions into this game too to pay 5 $ to reveal all points of interest on the map  yes how low can you sink please    that,s more than I have payed for the hole game 


Oh and did I mentioned the graphic settings  they consists ONLY of the following
Motion Blur  On/Off
Screen Resolution
Vsync  On/Off
And a Preset general graphics quality low/medium/high/ultra   not modifiable further
That,s all you can set in the graphics options no advanced or customisation options nothing

I don,t know if I will ever buy another need for speed maybe when there,s a new developer and not freaking EA  then ill give it a try no wonder all NFS are trash they push out a new game every year of course it,s not good when you only have like 1 year to develop it good games take  YEARS to develop maybe you should start from scratch give the NFS series a break and reboot it with a good game in a few years 

If you want a good racing game forget NFS  get yourself wreckfest / GRID / forza horizon/ or if you more into very realistic racing games Dirt 2.0  maybe EA  can learn from those on how to make a good game again 

The only good thing I can mention is yeah the graphics look pretty good on ultra  and there is some sort of story in the game but that,s it for the Positive 

Result : Refunded  Not even worth 2.99$ for me  better get yourself 3 or 4 beers
The Name of the game is  what i want now * NFS Payback*   Yes Payback pay me back my money

You can gift this game to your friends if you hate them

I finished it years ago on Playstation and came back to it recently on the PC for the 4K experience. All the physics bugs are still there. Still has that awful steering that seems mostly random. Winning races is more luck than skill especially with the kamikaze AI on every corner. And the 30fps cutscenes look awful in contrast to the 4k/120fps in-game.

Despite the shortcomings it's still fun. It has a ridiculous plot, lots of side quests, hidden derelicts to find, lots of police chases, it's all there as you'd expect in an NFS title.

The story and drifting physics kinda ruin the game... The story is voiced by people that are overly enthusiastic and its just not engaging or believable. The drifting is jankey especially when using ebrake, and the regular driving feels unresponsive sometimes and overly responsive other times... This game had potential but small stupid things made it ""ehhh"" at best. If i paid full price, I would have been upset but since i got it for 3 or 4 dollars, I'll let it slide.

Personally NFS Heat gets a 5 out of 5 on everything. Better physics, much more beautiful visuals, smoother drifting, engaging story and a vibe and presentation that no other racing game has. Forget Payback, just get NFS Heat...

Need for Speed: Payback is a good arcade game with a decent story. While I do recommend picking the game up if not played already, the story tends to get repetitive/boring after a couple of hours and I'd just like to get on and race instead of listen to adults act like kids for the 13 hours I spent playing the story. Personally, I've noticed some issues with the story, decisions that make no sense, and a lack of player personality connection to the narrative.

[h3]Character Impressions:[/h3]
Having ""100%""ed the story, my feelings towards the characters have solidified. Unfortunately, I find myself disliking all the characters except for Mac. Big shout-out to my man Mac for standing out amidst the rest. His character brings a unique and enjoyable element to the game (he's British).

""Need for Speed Payback"" is the latest installment in the long-running racing game series, and it attempts to blend the adrenaline-pumping thrills of high-speed chases with a Hollywood-inspired storyline. After spending five hours with the game, it's clear that Ghost Games has made some strides, but there are also a few speed bumps along the way.

Graphics and Sound (★★★★☆):
One area where ""NFS Payback"" truly shines is in its visuals and sound design. The game boasts stunning graphics, especially when cruising through the diverse landscapes of Fortune Valley. The cars are meticulously detailed, and the lighting effects during night races add an extra layer of immersion. The sound of roaring engines and screeching tires enhances the overall experience, contributing to the game's sense of speed.

Gameplay (★★★☆☆):
The gameplay in ""NFS Payback"" offers a mix of traditional arcade-style racing and a heavy emphasis on story-driven missions. While the racing mechanics are solid, the introduction of a progression system tied to vehicle classes and a card-based upgrade system feels somewhat forced. The need to grind for performance upgrades can be a bit tiresome, and the reliance on loot boxes to acquire parts might leave some players frustrated.

The game introduces three playable characters, each with their unique skills and storylines. However, the narrative is predictable and occasionally cringe-worthy, resembling a B-movie script rather than a gripping plot. The inclusion of cinematic sequences during races is a nice touch, but they often disrupt the flow of the gameplay.

Open World and Exploration (★★☆☆☆):
Fortune Valley is an expansive open world, but it lacks the depth and variety found in other open-world racing games. The map feels underutilized, and the lack of meaningful activities or side missions can make exploration feel like a chore. The absence of a day-night cycle limits the visual diversity, making the environment feel static over time.

Multiplayer (★★★☆☆):
Multiplayer in ""NFS Payback"" offers a mix of races and events, providing a decent extension of the single-player experience. However, the progression system's influence on multiplayer can lead to unbalanced matchups, with players who have invested more time in grinding for better parts having a significant advantage.",1702376852,1702376852,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game provides a well-sized open-world populated with multiple racing disciplines, collectables and minor activities. Enjoyers of Burnout Paradise may find themselves right at home in Fortune Valley. Car-customization is also good, and the livery editor in particular is quite freeing!

The story is typical action-movie fare with archetypal characters presented in a feelgood manner. Getting to play three different characters who all cooperate and communicate throughout the game made me feel more invested than I'd typically feel with the nameless self-insert found in other racing games. The story set-pieces are spectacular and provide some thrilling drives (although some cutscenes might have worked better as gameplay).

Payback does not have free-roaming cops like you'd expect from Heat or Most Wanted(2005). Instead, cop chases are limited to specific events and story missions. I think this works well for the game, as it allows the player to explore and complete activities to their heart's content. I think abruptly being forced into a chase would quickly become annoying if all I wanted to do was play around with a few drift zones or hunt down the last piece for my derelict car.

While I agree that the slot-machine upgrade system is a bit shit, it hasn't actually been a hindrance to my progression in practice. In my experience, the game provides enough resources to let you upgrade what you want when you want to.",1662424445,1702314851,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

""Need for Speed Payback"" often finds itself under the shadow of its predecessors, but I believe it's a game that has unfairly received its share of criticism. Despite its arcade-style physics, a hallmark of the NFS series, Payback manages to deliver an enjoyable racing experience that outshines its more recent counterparts.

The arcade-style physics, while not groundbreaking, stay true to the series' roots and offer a familiar and fun driving experience. In my opinion, Payback surpasses the two most recent NFS titles, and I find myself consistently returning to it whenever the need for high-speed thrills arises.

Is the game worth it? Yes, but the price tag of €29.99 for a title that's over 5 years old might be a bit steep. I would argue that a more reasonable price, around €20, would make it a much more attractive proposition. At that point, I'd wholeheartedly recommend it to racing enthusiasts looking for a classic NFS experience.

The story in Payback is engaging enough, providing a solid backdrop for the adrenaline-fueled races. The gameplay itself is a highlight, delivering the fast-paced, intense racing action that fans of the series have come to expect. While online play can be enjoyable, finding a lobby may be a slight challenge, but the overall experience remains positive when you do.

In conclusion, ""Need for Speed Payback"" deserves a second look. Its arcade physics, engaging story, and enjoyable gameplay make it a hidden gem in the NFS series. While a price adjustment would make it an even more attractive option, it's a game that's worth considering for fans of high-octane racing adventures.",1663538661,1701959045,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Graphics are good but they could have been better, especially the character models and there is a day and night cycle, however the weather is simple with only sunny days while nothing else happens, which is pretty disappointing. The world could have used some extra work to make it feel more alive, especially in the city and some other specific areas.

Sound is great, loud and burning with excitement. Music is just great, there is a good variety and it just goes well with the racing and i never really got bored of the songs.

Story is nice but nothing interesting happens while it tries to make it seem that way. The dialogue is fine, it can be a bit funny or a bit overused and distracting sometimes. Ending is average and somewhat rushed.

Game play is quite fun and i played it on medium difficulty. The map is great, it's big, diverse and the races can be very long but enjoyable. There is a good amount of racing options and while some are not that great they do fill the map in a very nice way and going through the different areas is a pleasure. It is nice and easy to progress until you are required to upgrade your cars a lot since you need five of them for the main types of races as each car is chosen by you for the type of event it will be used for the entire game. It can take a while to finish and you can get stuck due to the upgrade system being based on RNG and your car not being able to keep up later on, however i didn't really had a problem with it since i had enough upgrade cards and combinations to progress nicely or i would just buy from the shop whatever card helped more for each car. You get one card per each race as well. The AI can be challenging and pretty aggressive which sometimes makes it very hard to catch up, but i never had a car properly upgraded for the number the event recommended. Customisation is nice and cool but most of the parts need to be unlocked by doing the tasks required which can be a bit annoying. The speed feels good especially later on and it is boosted a lot by NOS which sounds like a plane taking off and it's just amazing. There is a nice amount of cars to choose from and as always more cars could have been added but the upgrade system would just make it even more annoying to upgrade them all if you chose to do so.

Single player and Multiplayer are combined which is very good here in particular, again, due to the upgrade system.

Minor issues i have that affected my experience a bit:
 - the cards that you get with one car can never be used for another.
 - Having to buy a car for each event is one thing but to have to upgrade it again even if it's the same car for all of them is just stupid and since you cannot share cards makes it even worse.
 - dialogue during racing is fine but eventually becomes a bit annoying and it would have been nice to have an option to turn it off.
 - a lot of cut-scenes cannot be skipped which is stupid even more so after you've seen them once and there isn't an option for this as well.
 - events during racing are fine but they could have been done during actual game play by the player instead of showing what happens.

Biggest issue i had is that there is an actual slot machine that can get you the cards with the upgrades that you need and it uses the extra cards that you sold for it as currency. Terrible idea to add such a thing in the game.

In a world where racing games weren’t striving hard enough to one-up cheesy blockbusters, one franchise steps to the plate, and most notably replaces the word “family” with “crew.” [b][i]Need for Speed: Payback[/i][/b] touts quite the adventurous story, and an expansive scope, but how much of that is any good?

Have to say, Frostbite 3 might not be the smoothest game engine around, but it sure is pretty... sometimes. Garage close-ups of cars and vibrantly lit downtown areas are some of the best views you’ll get in this title, with great shading and model qualities. Compromises are apparent when you look closer to your usually shiny car: reflections are toned down or even absent, no matter if you’ve wrapped your ride in chrome. Daytime looks visually flat despite its vibrant colours. Human animation is a weird mix of bad and good, with nice details but poor posing and timing.

Just one notch below the highest graphical settings, my [i]Ryzen 9 3900X, 64GB RAM, 1070 Ti, Windows 10 Pro[/i] system runs the game at 60fps and 1440p resolution, with occasional dips to the 50s when passing through dark tunnels. Gamepad controls are unrebindable and you have to make do with just two presets… This is how I also realized keyboard controls are rebindable, and not actually bad.

[h3]Air Mac![/h3]
Oh boy, the dialog is just awful. It might’ve banked on the cheesy presentation of mid-2000’s street racing movies, but… come on now. Poor delivery, repetitive self-congratulatory statements from the main characters, forced lines and a generally obnoxious feel to it. Trust me, you’re hardly missing out if you mute it entirely.

Sound design is a little better, thankfully. Aside from being on the quiet side for some reason, even with all sliders at the maximum, you have decent car noises and environmental effects. Finally, music is mostly harmless: a few really good tracks are buried in a sea of generic rap, country and rock. Some standouts are the composed pursuit soundtrack and the Speedcross-exclusive songs. There’s an attempt to reduce repetition by “theming” the score based on time of day and location, but in practice it achieved the opposite.

Helped by a group of slightly less insane characters, one of which being the victim of the prologue’s attempted heist, the protagonists seek out vengeance against the one who sabotaged their heist, and save Fortune Valley from a tyrannical cartel by beating a bunch of gangs at street racing.

A totally ridiculous premise where any genuine tension is broken when racers trash-talk with weak lines such as “gonna CRUSH you”, and totally shattered because the leagues are pretentious butts who are “mistreated and outcast” for literally performing illegal activities.

[h3]I see myself… winning it all.[/h3]
At its core, [b][i]Need for Speed: Payback[/i][/b] is a thoroughly arcade-like racer, where the best lines are taken by drifting through corners rather than holding on the edge of grip. This, in itself, is fine. What’s less fine is the handling model’s specific details that undermine this. Instead of throwing your car’s back end out, the handbrake sooner makes you [i]understeer[/i] for a good while. Drifting response, stability and turning circles are, at best, vaguely communicated, and you won’t know if a car is a boat to drive until you invest some good time and money into upgrading and tweaking it. The worst part about this is that the cars generally drive the same, though some weird choices remain dominant over all others – as the likes of 911 RSRs can attest in online play.

Being a modern entry into the franchise, customization and player expression are a big deal. Thankfully you can bet that most every car on display has at least some body parts to pick through. Wider fenders, different rims, a different front and rear end, and a couple generic rear wings with the occasional unique spoiler – not a bad showing. I must give particular praise to the livery editor, which is not only powerful and host to some high-quality wraps, but all can be applied to any car at will. Add some vanity tyre smokes, a lower stance and neon lights, and you can really stand out
[h3]The cards are coming down.[/h3]
Yet while [i]visual[/i] customization is fine, [i]performance[/i] customization is terrible. You have performance cards with specific brands and bonuses attached to them. Buying from in-game stores yields only higher-level cards with barely any bonuses. The ways to get good cards are by either repeatedly grinding out events, or rolling a literal slot machine to get the right combo of stats boosted. Live Tuning, independent of performance cards, makes too little difference towards a better-performing or -driving car.

You’ll cover a sprawling map, open for exploration after the prologue with perilous serpentines, wide highways and grid urban layouts. Its size is on the larger side, but you don’t really need even more boring desert to offroad through. Events are split across six different disciplines, which means you’ll have to upgrade at least six different cars, independently of each other. Some discipline-specific gripes include Drag events also including straight-up races and [i]time attacks[/i], in cars that pop wheelies even when stock; and offroad cars are very eager to go airborne and still have an awkward speed limit off the pavement.

Meanwhile, another series staple – police pursuits – are sadly locked away in either linear-course events or as part of open-world “bait crates”, where you drive to a nearby destination without getting busted. Their lack of escalation and predictability are a huge shame when considering how solid the pursuit gameplay itself can be. Dodging oncoming Rhinos and shunting cops out of range of their ECMs are a right rush.
[h3]An artist can turn any scrap into a supercar.[/h3]
The main story takes about 20 hours at a leisurely pace, taking you through five chapters and several blockbuster-caliber heists along the way. Past that, exploration is incentivized via collectibles and score-attack sections on the map, which reward cash and rep, and unlock visual customization categories. Rep grants you shipments, from where you unlock vanity customization and get a massive influx of cash and card parts – the Deluxe edition’s free shipments can actually turn the atrocious upgrade system into mere tedium. Meanwhile, beating street leagues gives clues on finding derelicts scattered around the world. Catch ‘em all from generally obvious map indications, and you’ll have another set of free cars to customize and upgrade to your liking. Roaming racers are but a momentary distraction, and finally, multiplayer is actually still alive, if quite limited. Open-world activities generally revolve around simple impromptu drag races with no one bothering to do much else; Speedlists with PvP racing work fine and you can stand a chance to win even against overpowered cars.
[h1]…Well, not tonight, it didn’t.[/h1]

2. Every time you want to upgrade a car, you have to fast-travel to garage, enter garage, select desired car, fast-travel again to tune shop, enter tune shop and see that the cards you need are missing!

3. The story of the game is interesting at the beginning, but after a while it becomes boring to death! The game races at the end of story are very long for no reason!

4. You have to make pointless jumps in different corners of the map to make derelict cars!

5. Police cars in this game are destroyed by looking at them, their presence or absence has no effect at all!

I see some of the comments being about how the story should be the core of the game, and these people have clearly not been playing this franchise very much. The core of the game is to show off luxury cars and emulate the feeling of driving them in beautiful surroundings. This is simply not a storyline franchise, and that's ok.

I haven't played it yet, but it does sound like a progression system that encourages grinding could be an ok addition to this game. I know there are lots of maps in some of the previous games that I like to drive just because it's really fun to do that.

Valid criticism for an NFS franchise is definitely the upgrade systems. That's always been one of the aspects of the franchise that has bothered me the most; NFS is exceedingly bad at it and this should be a high priority in making the games more fun.",1701031338,1701031421,True,1,0,0.498489409685134888,0,True,False,False

However the story to the characters designs the way they talk and their VERYVERYVERY CHEEESY LINES and everything else except the Gameplay, is just dull and I skipped most of them- if not all of them. I waited for probably around an hour to download this game full of excitement, but it didn't meet my expectation HOWEVER it's a GREAT thing for EA that I kinda enjoyed playing NFS HEAT and definitely one of my favorite racing Games.O.A.T because that'll mean they learnt and improve from their mistakes in Payback, I mean the characters looked not so NFS-TOP-TIER, the characters models and the interesting-ness of characters in NFS MOST WANTED 2005 looked WAAAY Better. The only flaw during gameplay was that some props like thin trees like a piece of branch sometimes aren't breakable so that can frustrate people especially when you're starting to get serious in the race.

I bought this game for $2.99USD anyways so, because of the Autumn Sale but with that said when the sale is gone then mahn, welp that's all, thumbs up.",1701007441,1701007441,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False

Starting from the bottom:
I was huge NFS fan. NFSU, NFSU2, Most Wanted, Undercover, ProStreet... Those was my favourite games. Later I played Most Wanted 2 - it was not my cup of tea. I found there is NFS World and I quite like that quite well cause I found out, that I am better than others. But next games I found bit boring, then I tried NFS Heat and it was kinda fun. I purchased Payback as well - cause why not for 3€. But after short time I can say that this game sux. Rather buy Heat or play some other game because Payback is just pile of horse trash. Story is retarded like late Fast and Furious movies (if you are fan of those, this game is for you). Just please... Don't try to be GTA like game nfs... Give us race game, give us upgrades, don't bother with story, just stick to something that worked before - give us some endgame race boss to beat with us starting from bottom building reputation. Dont try to make movie like game with ''deep'' story. It is trash. Or if you want, please hire some better scripters. Thanks. 

BUT: this kind of game for 3€ is nice. Please, do not buy it for full price

Conclusion:
For 80%+ sale - Recommended
For full price - Not recommended

I do not have any expectation when I played as I treated it as ""Single player NFS Undercover-copy"" game, overall it was decent although some of stuff are inconsistent (looking at you Ghost Game physics).

Story and game progression reminds me NFS Undercover and I think some fanbase really did hate it I think considering previous entry are more felt like Underground as Ghost games back to Tuner roots (which definitely everyone back then expect a ""Sequel"" in sense of something like ""2015 but 2""). I kind of enjoy the whole but during the ending, felt like something is missing post-game.

Gameplay... my only comment for this one is the physics. How come something like Rally homologation cars have worse handling in Off-road compared to something out of 50's Americana heavy car which jerry rigged by your local mechanics. I cannot tell about meta cars since I did not even bother continuously playing online on this game.

Tuning Progression is the most controversial thing on this game for me, for some reason you have to equip cards and you cannot jump straight to highest tier of performance card (the one that randomly available from shop).

If I wanted to give it rating, I'd give Payback 6/10 as a racing game, 4/10 as NFS game.",1700751657,1700751657,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You fight against Street Leagues, Street Leagues are racing crews, each with a distinct style and boss, each one of them race in their turf in and around the city. Defeating these leagues to get to the top spot and contest in the top league and payback for they did to you, and thus the name!

There are several types of race events in the game, that requires each their type of cars and you will drive as one of the three racing driver of your crew based on the type of event.

Race:
• Standard circuit races on paved roads.
• Compete against opponents in a lap-based or sprint format.
 
Drift Race:

• Slide your car sideways through corners to accumulate points.
• Drift events emphasize style and control.

Off-Road Race:

• Off-road events require sturdy vehicles to take the action off the beaten path.
• Race through dirt trails, forests, and rocky terrain, Rally-style races through dirt and mud provide a refreshing change

Drag Race:

• Short, intense sprints on straight roads where timing and precision are crucial.
• Master gear shifts and nitrous boosts.

Runner Events:

• High-speed escapes and pursuits to evade the cops usually in time-bound getaway.
• Also there are time-bound delivery missions 

Speedcross Events (DLC):

• Introduced as DLC, Speedcross mode adds a fresh twist to the original game by combining traditional racing with obstacle-filled in huge man made arenas.
• Perform stunts, jumps, and drifts to earn points.

Roaming Racers:
• Roaming Racers are members of street leagues who drive predefined routes across Fortune Valley. Challenge them at 3 different tier to lure out their boss and win the league.

Review: 

The Best:

Heist Missions:

• Some missions involve heists, where you steal high-value cars and escape with very intense chase. These missions are very good and feels super satisfying with great cinematics in between, these missions inject excitement and and a sense of urgency into the story.

The Good:

Visuals and World Design:

• Fortune City is a vibrant, open-world environment with diverse landscapes, from deserts to urban streets.
• The lighting effects during day and night races are stunning.
• Car models and customisation options are visually appealing.

Car Customisation:

• Payback continues the franchise’s tradition of turning ordinary road cars into wide-body beasts.
• The customisation options are extensive, allowing you to tweak every aspect of your ride.

Arcade Racing Mechanics:

• The handling model is straightforward and easy to learn.
• Drifting around corners and pulling off jumps feels very satisfying.

The Okay:

Story and Characters:

• Unfortunately, the story lacks depth and emotional engagement.
• The characters do not connect with you. Even the protagonist feels artificial.
• The cut-scenes often interrupt gameplay flow and fail to deliver the cinematic impact they aim for.

Linear Cop Chases:

• The police chases lack the dynamic intensity seen in earlier NFS titles, especially old school title such as NFS Most Wanted (2006).
• They follow a predictable pattern, making them feel repetitive, not much of a challenge and easy to evade.

The Bad:

Upgrade System and Grinding:

• This upgrade system is the worst, it's like a mix of lottery and loot-bag, and the parts you get randomly applies for only the car you drive that moment.
• To unlock better performance parts, you’ll need to grind races and events.
• The upgrade system feels tedious and slows down progression.
• Improper use of cash system for upgrade, by the end you'll end up with too much cash.

Dialogue and Voice Acting:

• The dialogue is cringe-worthy at times.
• Voice acting struggles to make characters relatable, feels very artificial.

Overall Need for Speed Payback is a mixed bag. It offers a diverse range of race types, from high-speed circuits to off-road adventures. Roaming racers add an extra layer of challenge, and the Speedcross DLC injects even more excitement into the mix. While it nails the arcade racing mechanics and car customisation, its weak story, grinding mechanics, and lacklustre dialogue hold it back. If you can overlook these flaws, you’ll find an enjoyable racing experience. I’d rate it 7 out of 10. I am a long time player of need for speed franchise from its inception. Played every single title so far, so the rating is slightly favoured.

In the end, Payback doesn’t quite reach the bar it has set. However, if you’re a fan of arcade racers and love tinkering with car mods, it’s worth a spin. Buckle up, hit the gas, and chase those super cars across Fortune City!",1700632979,1700632979,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- console-focused UI that doesn't even support mouse in any way, key bindings like ""X"" for quit make no sense
- the game took me straight to action without letting me to explore menu and settings, making me to watch some kind of a wannabe-movie shit
- quick races either aren't there or are unlocked by playing the so-called ""story mode""

2. Sometimes progress towards several achievements are not recorded

- Gameplay 8/10
It's just so easy for a racing game, the mechanics and difficulty wise.

- Graphics 8/10
Good, but not so special but yeah it's good.

- Audio/Music 8.5/10
The car engine sound is pretty nice actually, and the music isn't that bad.

- Storyline 7/10
It's too short, but it has an ""average"" storyline like the other nfs games, just add a little bit of ""fast & furious family and betrayal"" kinda plot.

- Enjoyability 9/10
Pretty fun to play, very casual and enjoyable for a racing game.

- WORTH TO BUY 8/10
It could be cheaper for the actual price. but if it's on sale, I could easily recommend you to buy this game. This game is a solid NFS game.

• Graphics settings in game: Low
• Controller layout: Specter NFS Payback Steam Deck (disables gyro controls which are enabled with default layout)

Payback is the first NFS to introduce off roading, which, tbh, is not a good one.
The story is not long but requires a lot of grind to complete so it will still take quite some time to 100%

Decision to lock police behind the story and ""bait crate"" events was a very poor decision. Ability to get into cop chase while free roaming would have significantly improved the repetitive experience that is NFS Payback

There is no ability to manage controller settings or input in order to try and mitigate how shitty they all handle, which I believe is a massive design oversight. Every car in this game feels sluggish and unresponsive right up until you tip the thumbstick over an invisible line, and then it starts oversteering you into a wall. If you barely even touch the stick to aim your car slightly in one direction then let go, it does the real-world equivalent of jerking the wheel abruptly, which, thanks to the semi-realistic physics in the game, upsets the car and ruins your ability to maintain a steady line. The best way I could describe the problem is that it feels like, instead of turning a steering wheel with a thumbstick, you are relaying instructions to the digital guy driving the car. He barely turns it until you SCREAM at him to start steering, and then, startled, he turns it all the way, causing you to oversteer...then you tell him he's steering too much, and he twists it all the way back to neutral causing an overcorrect, just like a real-life amateur driver. It's absolutely infuriating to drive a supposedly two-million-dollar car that handles like a shopping cart you're pushing backwards.

Every NFS game from Porsche Unleashed to Carbon has great controller steering with cars that feel responsive and linear. In those games, if you take your finger off the thumbstick it doesn't YANK the car back to neutral steering position abruptly. I was thinking about digging out the steering wheel to hopefully salvage this game, but frankly, if you only have a controller, don't even bother with this game.",1698634259,1698634259,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Solid fun racing game. 
My rating is let down by how plain outright annoying and strange the cops can get, and how stupid some of the race tracks are. However, the racing is fun, cool cars, decent customization, decent story.

>> The good:
- The game still looks pretty good.
- Some of the races were pretty entertaining and the vistas are pretty cool, even tho they are not the best in the series. 
- The music is allright and the sound design is actually decent.
- The drifting felt satisfying.

>>The bad:
- TF is that story? Mobs and gangsters and street racing mafia? I mean, it is enough to carry you through the whole game without really questioning it, but it is so cheesy.
- The handling felt allover the place, it lacks consistency. 
- The grinding for cards is unbelievable.
- The cops. Jesus they are so dumb and useless. After a 2 minutes chase, i could just simply accelerate and lose them.
- The lack of cops in freeroam, but this is just a me problem I guess.
- The traffic. What the hell is wrong with it. I feel like this game has the worst traffic AI/spawn in all the NFS games I've played. 

>>The UGLY:
- The damned upgrade system. Really? Cards? With a luck element to it? I get it, it is story related, casino tied and all, but did you guys really needed to place a ""Spin the wheel"" mechanic to such an important part of the game? I was lucky to get the Deluxe Edition with supply crates so i can get lots of tokens, but if not for that, i feel like it would have been a hell of a grinding game, more than it is already.
- The damn drag races events with time trial/sprints using GODDAMN DRAG CARS. The handling was already weird, the choice of sprint racing using drag cars was a really bad one, just to make the game longer or to troll the players, i suppose.",1696949660,1696962017,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I wont comment on its handling as I played it with the Unite Mod, but I would say play the game with that mod, as it adds a lot in the game, but mind you, that will make sprints in any drag-build impossible as the car will refuse to turn. [/b]
[b]What I liked:[/b]
[b]1. The map is actually pretty cool and way better than Heat's map with its scenic views, dynamicness, and elevation changes.[/b]
[b]2. Outlaw racing was a cool idea and it added some variety in racing.[/b]
[b]3. It has a lot less collectibles, which I like a lot.[/b]
[b]4. Derelicts (FH's Barnfinds) around the map was a nice idea.[/b]
[b]5. Drag racing. I really like that this game had it.[/b]
[b]6. The story. I know its cheesy and all but I still liked it, because at least it had length.[/b]
[b]What I didn't like:[/b]
[b]1. The lack of cop chases in free roam.[/b]
[b]2. Scripted story missions.[/b] The story missions would have been way more interesting if they were dynamic, like we had to actually escape the cops in some missions.
[b]3. Lack of racing at the start of the game. [/b] The presence of story actually hurts this game, as in the start of the game, there are barely any races, and leveling up doesn't help a bit. Would have loved if the game had a bit more racing and the boss missions took place on these tracks.
[b]4. Lack of rewards.[/b] This game doesn't give me a good reward for any of the side missions. Like after collecting everything, or beating all crews in Outruns should have rewarded us with something, but there isn't much.
[b]5. It's nitpicking, but the setup of the story.[/b] They just start the game with Lina betraying the crew. Why, never explained. And that it difficult to connect with the story. 
Overall, the main problem with Payback is that is struggles the basics, especially at the start. And the next installment, trying to correct the problems left out all the good stuff of Payback like derelicts and Outruns and instead gave us more of collectibles.

This game seems ok from the start the story itself is ok. The car list is a decent mix of old and new. The let down is the upgrade cards. These cards are meaningless. Now I have this game on Xbox One so I have played this game a little further than my PC counterpart. I am ok with this game visually but with having the feel of forcing myself to play the game versus wanting to play. This game seems missing some things. The traffic pop in and out as you fly down the streets if you choose to do that this open world game is truly open world. Mocking Forza Horizon. This game feels like a copycat to many games in my opinion. Even the action sequences feel like the Fast and Furious movie series. It may sound like I hate it and in some low parts yes, but overall if I were to rate this game it would be 5/10. It is a racing game from EA but it feels very rushed out and has shavelweare of Microtransations with the upgrade cards or the car parts in the crate for the select few cars you have to find across the  map which is also not fun.

1. The class and upgrade system, come on, just let me put anything i want on anything i want, and please, dont make me use a character i dont want to (tyler is the less annoying one).
2. No free roaming cops is a problem, i know they said it would be annoying in a map this big, but it was as simple as making it a player decision, as well as you can change difficulty, switch free roaming cops at will, after all the difference with the bait crate system would be that there would be an actual chase, like in older nfs, these ones are a joke.
3. Drift races are very bad designed, at first the points you have to reach is absurd, obviously you can if you memorize the track and make an almost flawless run, but i didnt purchase nfs to get a driving geometry dash. And then, later on the required points are just a joke. Its very weird, it starts hard and then becomes very easy.
4. Drag races, dont know whose idea was to put dragsters in sprints and time attack races, but its the dumbest thing i seen. For context, drag cars just dont turn, if theres something in front of you, you will crash into it.
5. Offroad races, boring and frustrating at the same time, very inconsistent behaviour of the cars.
6. Story is crap, not that i mind that, just stating it.
7. The game scams you quite often, up to the point it appears to be on purpose.
On the other hand, i liked the graphics and the available cars, i would liked to see some others but its a good selection. Soundtrack has a good variety with only one or two tracks i didn't like but its ok overall.
I purchased it on sale, will play it once, complete it and most likely not play it again.

Closer to a modern Fast & Furious than previous games, the game offers epic missions and classic races.

The story takes place in Fortune City, a sort of Las Vegas.
The Clan, a sort of mafia that controls the entire city, steals cars and fixes races, makes a lot of enemies.
They attacked the wrong people, your Crew.
You will have to take revenge for their misdeeds.
To do this, you will have to defeat other Crews to rally them to your cause and to access the Outlaw's Rush.
It's the biggest race in Fortune City!

Several types of races will be offered to you:

- Classic street races, sprints.
- Drift races, quite an art.
- Offroad races, worthy of Rally games.
- Speedcross races, offroad where you have to do stunts, drifts, jumps and destruction.
- Drag races, where gear changes are manual and technical.
- Varied missions: exfiltration, delivery, or theft.

You control three characters who evolve in an open world and each have their own personality and specificity:

- Tyler, specialized in street racing and Drag,
- Mac, the king of Drift, Offroad and Speedcross,
- Jess, the fastest and most efficient driver.

There is large choice of cars, logically divided into several groups: Racing, Drift, Speedcross, Drag, Offroad, Mission...
The customization is endless and the choice of parts is plethoric.
The very nice soundtrack, focused on Rock N'Roll and Rap / Hip-Hop, 
with artists like Queens of The Stone Age and Gorillaz.

Some downsides are to be deplored:
- The strange behavior of vehicles, with bizarre physics, like other NFS games from Ghost Games.
- The ""Speedcards"" system to improve the performance of your car.

NFS Payback is a very pleasant episode to play, with rich content and a storyline worthy of Hollywood.

The story is forgettable and the cool cinematics are very early in the game, and after that it goes downhill with not so much action, so take that in mind if you want story. Other than that everything is great, again, I really liked the variety of cars and races. The activities/challenges are though but doable once you are on the endgame.

So far activities in game are good I like how it mixes free roam challenges and progression to beat bosses by areas like nfs carbon. The upgrade system by using cards is more entertaining than just buying new parts it feels like gambling xd. Derelicts are something cool as you have to figure out where a part is and then once you get close to it find a way to reach exactly where the part is. Has fair ambient I have seen planes and birds when driving. Almost anything you do while driving gives you rep so that is nice.

And that's what always intriqued me about [b]Payback[/b], so with a recent sale, I thought [i]""Hey, why not?""[/i].
That was my second mistake.
The first one was me thinking I would enjoy this after heavily disliking and bailing out of [b]Need for Speed: Heat[/b], its sequel, after about eight hours last year.
My third mistake was playing this for way longer than I should have.
At about ten hours I have had enough.

[b]Need for Speed: Payback[/b] is terrible in my opinion.
The story is boring, brings nothing new to the table and both story sequences and cutscenes seem to lack a ton of polish and heart. Worse, the characters are cardboard cutouts of your basic street racing-/heist-related tropes and barely exist outside of quips and stilted back-and-forths.
The gameplay consists of the usual bullshit brake-to-drift physics (seemingly somehow worse than in the 2015/2016 reboot), making every car an understeer monster, fighting you at almost every corner and taking both the control and the fun out of driving your car, no matter the upgrades.
You know, the basis of what should be good in a racing game.

What should also be good and enjoyable in a racing game are the tracks or in [b]Payback[/b]'s case, its open world, titled Fortune Valley, which is a rather mixed bag. The non-city parts are alright, featuring various serpentines across multiple biomes and even allowing some verticality for a more varied environemnt. The city parts however are difficult to navigate, mostly because of a confusing layout, which is compounded by the fact that the minimap doesn't differentiate between tarmac roads, dirt roads, alleys and shortcuts. Also having absolutely no information about elevation differences doesn't help either.
The open world is also only partially [i]open[/i], because a lot of the country roads are actually corridors and don't allow you to drive through roadside barriers, making it hard to discern what won't and will stop you on a collision. Worse, this also happens in the more urban environments, where some walls, fences or sidewalk objects are destructible, while others are not. That huge steel lamp post? No issues. That tiny tree on the sidewalk? Na, sorry, will completely crash your car.

Visually the game looks okay, but the game world has a really boring color palette during the day and for somehow being a fictional version of Las Vegas, the main city is barely alight during the night.
It also doesn't help that for some reason [b]Payback[/b]'s the only Frostbite [b]Need for Speed[/b] game, that doesn't fully work with an ultrawide aspect ratio? Not like [b]Need for Speed: The Run[/b] in 2011 had that already figured out and all.

But the worst for me is the gambling upgrade system (there's a reason [b]The Crew[/b] dropped that with the sequel) and the unbalanced races/missions (although those aren't helped by everything above either).
After beating any mission or race you get a new upgrade card, which is randomized. This can either be a really good upgrade or not.
If you don't want to equip the card you can either stash it (which makes it only useable for this very specific vehicle!!!), sell it for cash OR trade it in for a card point (which can be used for any car!).
For three card points you can then spin the wheel and get a random upgrade card. Out of the three available attributes of the wheel you can freely lock one (car part, brand or focus type, the last one being, for example, about top speed or acceleration), while the other two are randomized. But again, for the cost of three cards, you can gamble for a new one, one which might also not be good and also isn't useable in any other car.
But as long as you win your races, take on some of the bets during them and not switch/buy too many cars, you should have enough cash to get the upgrades you need, it might just take a bit for the upgrade shops to refresh their inventory after enough real time has passed.

And speaking of the races, as long as you got the right car level, the road and drag races were fine for the large majority. No weird rubberbanding ai drivers, but also not really a true challenge, despite playing on hard.
However the drifting missions and offroad races were annoying for the most part.
Regarding the latter, the camera on offroad segments is way too bouncy and offroad cars are really drifty off the road, which seems kinda counterintuitive, if you ask me.

[i]Short tangent: I really do not get why all these modern sim-cade racing games want you to jump your car so much? Your fucking driving physics aren't made for that. Stop it![/i]

And regarding the former, despite often being several car levels above the requirements and knowing how to drift well in most games, I did not have a lot of fun in a lot of these races, because the whole drift physics just never seem to work out like you'd expect a car to behave. It does give you control over the car, but not in a way that makes sense, to me, which coupled with the weird road and curve designs, it just wasn't fun.
In the end it was a drift race that made me stop playing, so I dunno. Normally I'm all over drifting in games, but maybe not in current Need for Speed games I suppose. I thought it was fine in the reboot, for what it's worth.

Oh and almost forgot, the cops are horrible. They're either wrecked in seconds or can bring you to an instant stop while going 200 kph without taking any damage. But the worst part is that you do not escape police chases and you're never free to chose any route, you're always (!) following a choosen route and when your near the end, the cops will just fall back and you'll escape. Which isn't completely true, because I managed to escape while still being only meters away from three cop cars. It's just all a farce.

And honestly, I could go on and on, there's so much that just isn't good in this. I tried going in with reserved expectations, but I'm still really disappointed.
Maybe it is time to dust off those [b]Carbon[/b] and [b]Most Wanted[/b] discs and finally play some good [b]Need for Speed[/b] once again. Too bad you can't get those anymore.
Just... stay away from [b]Need for Speed: Payback[/b].

[b] Characters: (7/10) [/b] There are a few standout characters that are pretty charismatic, too bad its not our protagonist. The voice acting can be laugh out loud bad at times.
[b] Story: (7/10) [/b] The story is fine, what puts it over the edge is the payoff at the end.
[b] Cop Chases: (2/10) [/b] They exist, only in events.
[b] Cars: (5/10) [/b] The selection is what you would expect, not as good as Forza Horizon 4 (which came out only a year later). With the performance system all cars end up feeling pretty same-y. Shout out to the inclusion of the 240DL.
[b] Upgrade System: (6/10) [/b] They opted for a “Card Based” system for upgrades. Luckily not bound to microtransactions. The system is alright once you figure out which brands work the best. 
[b] Overall: 6.4/10 [/b]

As a big fan of Most Wanted and Undercover I was hoping that this would be a more modern iteration on that formula. I was disappointed that there were no open world cop chases and that the upgrade system feels very RNG. Overall for the sale price of $5 I think this is a good deal for a few days messing around and having fun.

If you buy a car you need to play a damn lottery to get some tunning cards to tune up your car, which is impossible cuz it will take alot like alot of your time, so i finished the game with only one car BMW M5 F90 i was racing with the exotic cars with a sedan xD, there is no point to unlock the Regera or something else cuz it will take infinity to tune the new unlocked cars.

now about driving mechanics..... afwul :@ if you drive a BMW M5 with 1000 HP these V6 dodge police cars will get you anyways no matter if you are going with 370 km/h xD
The Rhinos (big police cars which are trying to crash you from ahead) they are spawning in 20 meters ahead you, you can't do a manoeuvre to avoid them if you are going fast, if someone remembers NFS WORLD it was better with the Rhinos.

there are 3 type of races, RACE,DRIFT,OFFROAD,RUNNER..... the race drift runner mechanics are fine... but offroad is awful you can't do any manoeuvre cuz its like driving on the ice.",1644264120,1690708132,False,1,0,0.512738823890686035,0,True,False,False

The game has many things you can do: You have essentially three different car classes to choose from that are race, offroad, and runner and these are the main elements of the game. You also get additional car classes such as drifters and rally cross cars that are to be used in events dedicated to them. 

Within the forementioned main car classes you have to take on The Roaming Racers, race events where you have to work yourself from the ground up to face the bosses of different car clubs and by defeating them gaining money and popularity. In addition you have small challenges placed throughout the map that you must try to win (speed cameras, drifting events, and such). All of this is to give body to the main story line in which you cannot necessarily proceed without doing those small additional tasks.

The game is good fun and I personally found the drifter and race car classes to be the most enjoyable to play. The story line cutscenes were, in my opinion, quite cringeworthy, but besides that the quests themselves were good.

I think I was too harsh on Payback! Its fun, the driving experience is actually a bit more varied than in FH5 (where all terrain feels the same!). I'm the kind of player that uses the search to find pre-made tunes for cars in FH5, so I found the card game feature in Payback quite entertaining too. So yeah, disappointing FH5 experience has changed my mind a bit on Payback.

Original negative review: I bought this for £2.49 on sale. It's barely worth it even for that. I appreciate that 'arcade racer' often means a less-than-realistic driving experience, but this is seriously poor. It's just so boring. I've played for an hour and not found anything so far challenging. The racing is just a case of getting to the front of the pack after two corners and then casually driving in circles. Police (or other) chases are simply frustrating - it feels like GTA Online, where enemy vehicles just rubber-band to you like crazy and catch up to you out of nowhere. Not realistic at all. The free-roam activities feel like cheap-as-dirt Forza Horizon rip-offs.
While the plot is intriguing, the cutscene dialogue is cringey and the voice acting is mostly terrible. Almost vomit-inducing. There are also the silly lines that characters say while in-game: ""Let's kick this up a notch!"" (My word, I bet the writers all patted each other on the back so hard for the 'cool' lines!) My best guess is that a big share of the lines came out of the bin in the back of the Fast and Furious writer's room. Absolute garbage.",1662626118,1687596760,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Gambling aside, the game might be a competent arcade racer with decent visuals, featuring a suitable driving system for the map, a formulaic but fun story, and; hold your breath, the best off-road racing of any arcade racer yet; but as it stands now (thanks to the heinous micro-managing by the tyrannical overlords, EA), it is nothing more than a disheartening waste of Ghost's immense potential.

Rating: ★★★☆☆

Need for Speed Payback, developed by Ghost Games, offers a high-octane racing experience with an emphasis on intense action and cinematic storytelling. While it delivers on its promise of adrenaline-fueled races and thrilling heist missions, the game falls short in certain areas, preventing it from reaching its full potential.

One of the highlights of Need for Speed Payback is its captivating narrative. Set in the fictional city of Fortune Valley, players follow the story of three protagonists seeking revenge against a nefarious criminal cartel. The story's structure resembles a Hollywood action film, with heists, betrayals, and intense rivalries. However, the execution of the story and character development feels shallow at times, lacking the depth needed to fully engage players.",1684948954,1684948954,True,3,2,0.520416796207427979,0,True,False,False

Old NFS games had better Ai overall when you putted hard mode the bots different racers more correctly used to go better trajectory in road and use cross roads to pass you not in here. It's all fake and artificially boosted npc that will go 450km/k and you will notice it on minimap. In the heat it was even worse. NFS series is dead guys and this game last one that you can try something new. Rest in peace NFS series. (forgot to mention the types of races are awesome drift is cool, but off-road is insanely awful, and disgusting so put easy on off-road no matter how you drive no matter op car you have they will come in dirt 500km/h and fly away)",1684496974,1684497100,False,1,0,0.50519031286239624,0,True,False,False

Unfortunately, what 'Open World' I saw in my hour of play was basically being forced to go to specific places, despite the 'freedom' to drive around.

About 40% of my 1 hour of play time was spent in a cutscene.. ridiculous. Yes, theres a story to tell, but you dont need to cutscene for 3 minutes every 10.. sheesh.

Controls... LOL... Whoever made the keyboard mapping has never played another PC Game ever. Every control you would expect, is not. ESC is not the menu. WSAD arent the default driving (despite past NFS games doing this). Q/E are menu left/right (WTF). +/- or Up/Down are not zoom in/zoom out for the map, Ctrl/Shift are. And you cant change these, its ridiculous.

In the 4 races I played during my time, the driving mechanics were terrible. Drifting is a joke 'Double tap <left/right> and hard corner' its just a ridiculous thing to try to do when you're also taking the corner. What happened to rip it (handbrake) and crank it. Steering mechanics in general are pretty terrible, Its almost as if there is a large delay in releasing the button press, because the car will lunge in unpredictable ways. The Cop chase in the beginning, also terrible, roadblocks instantly appearing in front of you kind of terrible.

Remember the fun of damage from days past (NFS Undercover, etc), yeah no more... The joys of seeing your and rival cars smashed up as they hit things is gone... theres no 'penalty' to drive better other than you get slowed down.

If you like being handheld through an 'open world' game, sure, go play this, but otherwise, find something else. :sadtrombone:",1684478409,1684478409,False,0,0,0.426685333251953125,0,True,False,False

It was difficult to decide wether I should recommend this to anyone...who wants to race...

If you want to race...this is not reeeeeally the game for this. Because it makes you invest, at least, as much time in aspects of it that you might NOT AT ALL be interested in. Like offroad racing or those gimmcky stunt tracks....so....

you will have to spend much, much more time than you would like doing things you might not want to do. Just so that you can then, again, play the part you like to play.

So is this worth your money? At full price? No. At half price? No.
If its seriously reduced. Yes. Then it is ok.

There are so many aspects of this game that are extremely similar to other Need for Speed games(especially the one from 2015......wooooooow, copy/paste anyone?). If you know it, then you can only be dissapointed. 
The characters are...so VERY CRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINGE!

AND THE SOUNDTRACK IS THE WORST, SIMPLY THE WORST, THE UTMOST PAINFUL, HORRIBLE PLAYLIST OF ANY GAME EVER. I am not just shouting this out because I have pent up anger of my real life that I am unable to adequately vent. No, Really no. Someone just threw this stuff together last second of the last minute before they compiled the code to get it out there. That is the impression it makes. And music is important in a game all about style and speed and aaaaaaaction.

ps: The EA installer is abomination. It is huge, it does god knows what, is the first app not to properly uninstall itself in DECADES and give you a quirky little message saying ""no hard feelings"" when you start the process. REALLY?

The only things Payback gets right are the better handling, bringing back vanity customization like under glows, an option to play single-player vs 15's online lobbies only, drifting races, cops aren't a joke anymore & NOS SOUNDS SO POWERFUL.

Things I didn't like: 
- Cringier characters than the friend group of 2015
- Forced to play off-road races & delivery missions
- Horrible selection of music
- Cops weren't in free roam unless you triggered a collectible / mission
- Gambling for performance parts but you will have enough money by just playing

Nice racing game. I've always enjoyed this series. These games take me back to NFS Underground i miss that game sometimes. Such a classic. This payback game is smooth an good story. you get to do all forms of racing an even catching some big air off the jumps within your path. Crash into an wreck the cops or bad guys on your tail so you can get away an complete the job. So many cars so many options. Customize your ride an Tune up your beast to take it to the next lvl..

My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him in the online mode. loaded into the game, made my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and I cant wait to make future memories with my son.

One of the main reasons for this is the meticulously crafted open world that features the right balance of dense city spaces, wide open roads, and dirt roads along with verticality in the form of canyon trails and jumps. The map is a perfect playground for the game's different event classes, such as racing, off-roading, drifting, drag, as well as cop chases. The events are well-routed and diverse, but can feel overly scripted at times, especially the cop chases which are sprints along predetermined routes.

Racing gives you an adrenaline rush and offers a great sense of speed. The vehicle roster, performance upgrade system, and visual customisation are mediocre, but the cars look and sound good. Handling is satisfying and accessible, and varies by vehicle class.

The story is bearable for a Need For Speed game and winning events does give you a feeling of accomplishment. The plot is not grounded in reality, but that's alright for an arcade racing game that was inspired by the Fast & Furious movies. Progression is formulaic and straightforward. The dialogue, however, is more often than not, very cringe worthy — unsurprising for a Need For Speed game.

If you enjoy arcade racing, then Need for Speed Payback is worth checking out.

Sometime after Undercover, I stopped playing until the past year when i finally gave Heat a shot. Once I completed  the story in Heat, I found myself wanting more of the gameplay, but had absolutely zero interest in the style of Unbound.  So Instead I picked up this game, knowing the reviews are not great... it isn't as bad as I expected! but there are definitely some big flaws. 

Pros: 
- I actually prefer the driving mechanics in this game over Heat, it feels more snappy and realistic, and doesn't seem to force you to only drift everywhere. Muscle cars are somewhat viable!
-While still not at the level of  the games i remember, the soundtrack to this game is a million times better than the dumpster fire of a soundtrack Heat had. 
-I like the fact that there were so many different race options, and the runner jobs were a nice break from constant racing.
-I am always a big fan of barn finds and such, so the derelicts were fun, i wish there was more of them. the derelict super builds were also very cool to get.
-Vehicle customization seemed very robust and  it never felt I had not enough options for fenders, bumpers,  etc. 

Cons:
-The biggest frustration i have with this game is the speed card system. in theory its pretty neat, and If they simply allowed speed cards to be transferred between vehicles it would have made the game much more fun. Instead its a constant grind  of doing the same races and trying to earn lootboxes for trade ins. on this note, having to grind the same lootboxes for smoke and horn customizations was incredibly tiring. 
-I went into the game expecting a cheesy story, its a staple of any racing game. however, this definitely is really cheesy. 
-While almost all of the characters in the game are unlikeable (Except for maybe Jessica and Rav), I hate Tyler Morgan more than any character I have ever played. it is like the game devs decided ""Let's make a character whose inspiration is Lightning Mcqueen, but without any of the charm or personality!"" Every time he friggin speaks I want to just shut off the game. 
-Game physics are sometimes very annoying, too often i found myself  hitting invisible walls, being reset after ive already landed on my wheels and started driving off,  or being arrested when i had clearly started accelerating away from the cops already. 
-It would have been nice  if there was some sort of tangible reward for completing the jumps, speed traps, drift zones, etc. 

All in all,  i would buy it cheap as a decent time waster as long as you keep your expectations low. Forza Horizon, this is not.",1679876206,1679876649,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The one MAJOR drawback is the upgrade system. Holy hell is it miserable. The way the upgrade system works is you get 6 parts you can upgrade. Engine block, headers, exhaust, ECU, turbos, and gearbox. However unlike more traditional games, you get speed cards. So lets say, you have a 2010 Crown Vic Police Interceptor (I'll talk about that in a bit), by default the speed card levels are Level 8 on the CVPI. So to upgrade, you go to a tuning shop and either buy a Level 7 ECU or whatever. Or you can go to the ""trade-in"" which is essentially a slot machine. Here, you can lock in one category. Part type, brand, or stat type. Locking in one of these means, the other two are random. So if I want an ECU upgrade, I'll get a random brand, plus a random stat upgrade. What does all of this mean? Well the parts upgrade is just parts upgrade as mentioned. The brands, when you combine 3 of the same brand, or 6 of the same brand (or 3+3 of two brands), will give a boost to certain stats (think faction based boosts from RPGs) The stats? Power based (HP, top speed), Acceleration based (0-60, 1/4 mile time), Nitrous based (duration and power), ""stunt based"" (airtime based stuff), and brakes (Not handling oddly, just brakes). When you get a speed card which is usually (but not always) 1 level up from what you have equipped in that part slot, it could be any of the 5 brands (6 if you include stock but that isn't available), and either 1, 2, or 3 stat boosts (HP, Acceleration, or Brakes, or all three). As far as I'm aware, there is no way to buy speed cards from the shop with all three stat upgrades. I've only ever seen two at most. So if you want the most ideal build, you want either 6 cards of the same brand, or do a 3+3 combo (two diff brands of choice), THEN you need to get a good combination of stat boosts, and all the speed cards NEED to have ALL THREE STATS. This all seems confusing, but when you play, or look up images, you'll see how this can be a PITA. Not only that, but you only get a limited number of spins at the trade-in. You can get more via trading in duplicate/older cards. Point is, upgrading cars can be pretty miserable. You'll be stuck trying to get the perfect combo of speed cards for hours, maybe days. WORST PART. The cards are for THAT car only. You can't transfer them over to another car of the same class, or even the same car but in a different class (say, an Offroad Subie STi to a Racing Subie STi). So you have to do this for EACH INDIVIDUAL CAR YOU OWN. I'm gonna be real with you, just go download or open up Cheat Engine and give yourself infinite tickets to spin at the trade-in shop. Get mods or something. Don't torture yourself trying to build the ideal car.

Customization is nice. My only issue is that you need to play the game to unlock the ability to customize certain parts. Heat solved this by just letting you immediately start slapping on bodykits. Not sure if its because I had a shortcut DLC purchased on Heat. Either way, you're gonna have to get a fair bit into the game in order to unlock all customizable parts. The only other issue is, sometimes its hard to figure out what parts you need on a car in order to use specific parts. Some parts can only be installed if you have certain parts installed. Doesn't say which pieces are compatible, you just gotta install the corresponding parts and check again to see if it can be installed.

Gameplay wise, controls were pretty lacking IMO, you only get like 2 controller schemes for auto and manual mode. Manual Gear shifting layout is kind of weird to me and since that can't be changed, stuck with what they give you, at least Heat has decent control schemes even if its also 2+2 auto/manual like here. Unlike 2015, this game has skippable cutscenes THANK FUCKING GOD. I've said in some other review, I don't really care about the story in any NFS game. Just a personal preference. If its an action game, story is the least of my concerns. BF4? Cringefest, wouldn't want anyone to spectate me playing the SP. BF3? As much as I enjoyed the story and tone of SP, too dark probably for many. NFS 2015? Cringefest. Don't want anyone to suffer those unskippable cutscenes. If I'm watching a friend play a game, don't think I'd want to sit around trying to figure out the story half-way into their playthrough.

The world is a bit lacking IMO. Coming from NFS Rivals being my main NFS for a while, I'm used to cops and racers all roaming around the world at all times. 2015 at least had cops sitting around in random places. Payback? Cops and the House (?) rivals or whatever are only available for Chase type missions. No freeroaming cops. Freeroaming racers is nice, but no cops, no risk, and honestly even the Roaming Racers are kinda meh, still prefer Rivals open world. Great for hooning around and just cruising though.

Overall car list is good I guess, my only issue is with ""Abandoned Cars"". So when the game was still new and cool, they had these cars that were available as ""abandoned cars"". Cars scattered around the map, that you can collect, bring back to hideout (while evading cops) and you get the car permanently. Every week(?) they'd rotate out abandoned cars, one week its the BMW M3 GTR, next is something else. Well, here's where the Crown Vic comes into play. the 2010 CVPI was one of these cars. However, this car was only available TWICE. According to all google searches and posts I can find, it only ever appeared twice in the game. Eventually the support for the game was cut, all resources directed to NFS Heat. Abandoned cars are now actually abandoned and unobtainable. You can't get these cars anymore. Well...sorta. The M3 GTR for example, can't get it as is (namesake and all), but you CAN buy all the abandoned cars in stock form, then build them into abandoned cars (E46 M3 + GTR bodykit for example). They aren't the same IMO (M3 GTR is named M3 GTR, E46 M3 with GTR kit is still named E46 M3, so technically separate). All except the Crown Vic. This car only ever made two appearances in the Abandoned Car roster, then disappeared forever, never to be obtained again...unless you use mods. Which I did. Without mods or if you're on console, you'll never get the CVPI. Ever. Bummer.

Speaking of CVPI, for some reason this car is capped at 365 performance rating. Every other car is 399 max. Without mods, the CVPI maxed out at Level 16 speed cards at 365 PR. Mods just allow it to get Level 18 (max level) cards to bring it to 399. Turning the mod off = cap says 365 but performance is actually still 399 (when you pull up to events, it'll display your CVPI's actual PR if you have 399 and your level 18 cards will remain equipped/in your inventory/swappable, however in the tuning shop, Level 16 cards are the only ones that are available to buy/trade-in). Just odd how the CVPI seems very neglected. Sure its not an amazing car, but its certainly cool as fuck. Also I'm particularly biased because I own one myself....also the sound of the car in this game is dogshit. Don't think any game has an accurate sounding CVPI tbh. Wish the CVPI got more love in this game but oh well I guess.

Conclusion, fun game, cool cars, LOTS of offroading to be done in this game, derelict cars, customization. The only big flaw for me was the upgrade system. It allows for more diversity because its essentially RNG based (the stat upgrade combos that is) but having an ideal setup for all your cars, not enjoyable. I'd give it a shot. Also if you REALLY want the Crown Vic Police Interceptor, you'll absolutely need mods. Otherwise, unobtainable. Shame how neglected that car is in this game.",1640929224,1678838726,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Need for Speed Payback’s handling physics are not realistic at all. I don’t really think it’s possible to grip drive in this game, handling is heavily geared towards drifting through corners at high speed. Personally, I enjoy arcade racers; despite the unrealistic handling physics, I still find driving to be fun.

The performance upgrade system in Need for Speed Payback is probably the most controversial component of the game. In other Need for Speed games, performance upgrades can be purchased and equipped from the garage. In Payback it’s a bit different, Speed Cards are earned by winning races, purchasing from tune up shops or rolling on slots. Speed Cards have various different bonuses such as increased acceleration, nitrous, jump airtime and braking. Speed Cards can be equipped, stored, sold for money or sold for slot tokens. Initially, this feels pretty confusing but after playing the game for a few hours, I didn’t really find it to be a problem. I actually quite like the way that the upgrade system rewards the player for frequently using a car and allows for builds with different focuses.

There are several different event types such as circuit/sprint races, drift events, drag races, police escape runs, off-road races and speedcross events. The variety of event types helps keep the gameplay feeling fresh. Cars can only be used for specific event types, a car bought from the Race dealership can only be used in circuit and sprint race events. I like this as it forces the player to use a variety of different cars.

Need for Speed Payback has a huge selection of cars and customization options available for them. Definitely a high point in the game.

The game is set in Fortune Valley, which is a fictionalized version of Las Vegas. Need for Speed Payback probably has the worst open world designs in the franchise so far. I understand why there’s so much desert in the game, but it feels boring and repetitive to drive around in comparison to other Need for Speed titles.

Unfortunately, Need for Speed Payback is very easy, even on the harder difficulty modes. I’d have liked the game to offer a bit more of a challenge.

[b]Story – 7/10[/b]
As with most racing games, the story is not a focal point in Need for Speed Payback. It’s definitely one of the better stories in the franchise though.

The story is focused around three playable characters. Each playable character has their own missions that lead up to main story missions involving all three characters. I liked this approach to storytelling as it helps add some depth to the characters - something which is often missing in racing games.

The main story missions include plenty of cinematics, they’re way over the top and remind me of scenes from The Fast and Furious movie franchise.

[b]Visuals – 8/10[/b]
Need for Speed Payback looks amazing, especially considering that it’s a six year old game. The car models are incredibly detailed.

The visuals are slightly let down by the previously mentioned open world design. The open world is graphically impressive, but unfortunately this doesn’t save the bland design.

[b]Overall – 7/10[/b]
Need for Speed Payback’s bad reputation had put me off playing the game for years. I picked the game up on sale and I’m glad I gave it a try. I think the game gets an unfair wrap and is definitely worth trying for yourself.",1678715525,1678715525,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's an alright game with a lot of potential which is sadly held back by its shady practices (i.e. microtransactions) and weak character writing. I feel like I can't give this game a [i]thumbs up[/i] nor a [i]thumbs down[/i], because it's simply a mid-tier game.

[h1]After playing the sequel (NFS: Heat)[/h1]
NFS Heat in certain aspects makes this game look like a masterpiece. I came to appreciate NFS Payback a lot more and I actually think it's a pretty good game. I would much rather play this than NFS Heat, mainly because this one has a better handling system, story, map and event variety. Not to mention that this game's career mode is also much longer. I held myself back from writing a review for Payback, but there is so much good stuff here in comparision to Heat, I had to express my thoughts.

[hr][/hr]
[u]Gameplay:[/u] [b]8/10[/b]
This game is actually very fun. There is A LOT of variety in events and activities. The handling model is very arcade-y but super satisfying. The game is also decently long and it doesn't drag.

[u]Map:[/u] [b]7.5/10[/b]
The map has an unexplainable charm to it. Off-roading is soo good and the streets are also very well designed for all kinds of events. The downtown area is a bit small though and you can tell it wasn't the game's main focus point. There is also a surprising amount of variety, even though the map is mostly a desert.

[u]Progression:[/u] [b]7/10[/b]
The progression has actually been fixed by making the upgrading of cars less loot box based using ""Catch-up Packs"" which you can buy for in-game story currency. It's a bit slow at the beginning, but later on it's very good.

[u]Story:[/u] [b]7/10[/b]
Very strong theming ruined by weak character writing. Still very enjoyable and definitely keeps you going.

[u]DLC content:[/u] [b]9/10[/b]
MY GOD it is fun, WOW! They could literally make a standalone game with the SpeedCross mode alone, it is that good. Sadly, it's not very long.

[u]Car selection:[/u] [b]7/10[/b]
There is a decent amount of cars for each category. I actually don't mind having to buy a new car for each event type. I think it's a fun gameplay quirk which motivates you to buy more cars.

[u]Car customization:[/u] [b]7.5/10[/b]
Some cars have a lot, some cars don't. It's kind of a gamble but what you get in the worst case is still pretty decent.

[u]Music:[/u] [b]4/10[/b]
There is hardly any music in this game. It feels like 5 tracks are playing on loop all the time and it gets really annoying after a while. I recommend using your own music. This game is not as bad a NFS Heat though in this aspect.

[h1][u]Overall rating:[/u] [b]7/10[/b][/h1]
I can actually recommend this game. :)",1675081310,1678374687,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

The game is the twenty-third installment in the Need for Speed series and was released in 2017. As a language model, I don't have the capability to play games, but I can provide a review based on the available information.

The game is set in the fictional open world of Fortune Valley, where the player takes control of three characters, each with their own set of skills and unique play styles. The story revolves around the three characters seeking revenge on a cartel that has wronged them in the past.

The game features a wide range of vehicles, including cars, trucks, and off-road vehicles, which can be customized and upgraded to suit the player's style of play. The game's graphics and visual effects are impressive, and the open-world environment provides a sense of freedom and exploration.

The game's main campaign can be completed in approximately 20 hours, and there are also side missions and challenges to keep players engaged. The game also features an online multiplayer mode, where players can compete against each other in various races and challenges.

However, some players have criticized the game's reliance on microtransactions to progress in the game. In-game currency can be earned by completing missions and challenges, but it can also be purchased with real money. This has caused some frustration among players who feel that the game is pushing them towards spending more money.

Overall, Need for Speed™ Payback is a solid racing game with a great open-world environment and impressive graphics. However, the game's reliance on microtransactions may put off some players.",1662738092,1678207981,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

its a decent game, however its much harder to understand than most. its not very clear on what you have to do a lot of the time, and the story isnt as engaging as heat for example, since it feels like the tasks are kinda random? i like how you need to buy multiple safehouses but it can be annoying if youre driving from the opposite side of the map to save and quit. this does make the game more difficult which i like. the map is also much more confusing than some others, theres too much going on. overall, the races are fun, and so are the controls, but apart from that its not great, so if youre not that bothered about a good story, i would recommend, other than that, get it at a discount :)",1678145351,1678145351,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Progression sucks, they throw every car in your way hoping you would cargasm all the way through, which I don't get.. nitro was given to you right off the bat instead of earning it. I can't enjoy the story either, maybe I'm having high expectation for decent story in a racing game (they talk about Tyler's rent, why not put it in the game where you race to get money to pay rent? Makes it feel like something's at stake instead of the cliche gang-gang race battle in the town or whatever).

A chaotic and crashing type like I had played in the past Burnout or a NFS Most Wanted pump up version? 
My answer: 
The last option. 
I can't avoid it's a little frustrating for me coming from the same studio responsible for Burnout franchise where I expected that the player could trash it's oponnents on a Takedown mechanic, instead of this, they only inserted the stunts and skills for the most part and left the takedowns and big stunts for Runner category or very few specific events in the main campaign.

But if you are looking for a fun ride with no expectations whatsoever from that franchise, I'll recommend to play it since there a many different setups to personalize your vehicle, on which you can share on game server community, where you at least should give a watch as there are many users who do wonderful artistry.

- First of all very nice graphics and subjective feeling when driving cars.
- Tough races. I played on Hard, and that difficulty is really good and I think the way that should be played, because finally there is tougher NFS and we should honor that. So that is my recommended setting unless you need to lower it down.
- Many activities to complete. Yes, maybe some are repetitive but interesting to get them all anyway.
- Story is a little cliche but still it was nice to watch cutscenes.
- I liked the system of upgrade with cards and rolling for better ones.

On the negative side:
- Cars are not so much feeling different. Yes, driving experience is good but still I think that other NFS better presented difference in cars strength.
- Drag events are very easy and almost put for presentation, unlike other mods.
- I actually had to buy the DLC to show all activities on map. Some where almost impossible to find and buying DLC for 4.99$ for perfect game, which should always be part of the game. I mean WTF EA ?!

Man am I having fun in this game. Trust me it's a GREAT game (if you like NFS). I have bought this game 3x (PS4, Origins, and Steam)

I have played all of the NFS games from back in the day right up to ""Heat"" (I just beat the remastered hot pursuit with 34 hrs and all gold titles last week). 

This game is ridiculous fun. The driving physics are awesome (compared to 2015) and the car customisation is terrific. I was talking to my son and he says he can't get into this game because it has ""Cheesy cut-scenes and a story right out of the fast and the furious"". 

And for me, that's why I love it (maybe it's because I am old and I appreciate where gaming has come from and where it is today...I also appreciate a good ol' 80's style cheesy story!!).

Gameplay is varied and fun - both on road and offroad races, drift trials, drag races, cop chases that are legit fun, ""runner"" missions that involve all sorts of activities, and the wildly arcadey speedcross mode. Hunting down derelict parts out in the world was neat. Cars have a decent amount of visual customization, both body parts and paint/wrap.

Things going against the game.

1. Requires another launcher outside of Steam.

5. Course layouts.
6. Did I mention the horrible gameplay? Seriously, Criterion-style racing isn't fun. It's dumbing down already dumbed down arcade physics and it needs to go away.

Another run of the mill NFS game with almost nothing great that stands out. The handling is fairly arcady, the races are kind of boring or even annoying sometimes. The map is really bland and lifeless, especially the desert parts. The story is not that interesting, not really a surprise. The whole slot-like upgrade mechanic is trash, and doesn't add anyting of value to the game.

I played this because it's chill casual fun (also I got the deluxe edition for 90% off). What I liked was the mission progression, you get linear sets of races for various disciplines (drag, drift, runner, offroad) and it feels good to beat a league. The cars are also really pretty and there's a lot of customization. The graphics are all right, although this takes a toll on perfomance (the game doesn't run so well, even on recent hardware). 

If you can find it for a really small price it's worth it, otherwise I wouldn't bother.

Truthfully, the characters are rather forgettable and the in-game cutscenes are lazy, but first and foremost it's a racing game so I could care less about the characters as it's all about the gameplay, the feel and the sound which all happen to be pretty good. There's also lots to do, both in-terms of required missions and side missions, quite a few collectibles, etc. Graphics-wise, the game does not look like the screenshots and it's misleading as those visuals are only used in the pre-rendered cinematics and not in-game. Despite that... the graphics are pretty good, I'd say they're well-above average for a game released at its time. Though, 2015's Need for Speed style looked more visually appealing to me.

There are tiny or moderate annoyances that sometimes add up though like unskippable screens or ones that have a long delay before you can skip them, the lack of music variety (while the songs included are good and mostly fitting, they get samey and annoying to listen to and don't randomize enough), and sometimes the characters (especially Mac) are just cringe or make small talk that doesn't even have contextual sense. It is nice they react depending on what you're doing though. I'm not sure how I feel about the speed cards which are just these cards you equip on your car to make their stats better and on one hand it makes any car viable to use which is nice but at the same time it's really gimmicky and loot boxish. The respawn system is not good. At least in my experience it often respawned me against rocks, put me at fast speeds towards obstacles or cliffs only for me to wreck again. I ended up turning off the auto reset option for wrecks because it was really starting to trigger me due to the fact it took me less time just backing out rather than being reset two or even three times in a row. I also dislike the checkpoint rings and sometimes I would miss their edge by a tiny fraction and be forced to just restart the entire race because one big mistake is usually enough to make you lose on harder difficulties. I'd be at least okay with them if they were a bit larger.

I do have one major issue with the game though and that's the major stuttering and major FPS drops that happen in certain areas or certain events making it near unplayable. I have this game installed on an SSD paired with an i7-7700k, 32GB of RAM and an 8GB RTX 2070 on 1440p so this shouldn't be happening and it's rather annoying. After checking Task Manager, WMI Provider Host sometimes just ends up using an insane amount of CPU percentage while playing and I've yet to find out how to fix this aside restarting the game.",1672344969,1672875487,True,0,0,0,0,True,True,False

The game is just about about upgrading your car. They even included a score for how powerful your car is. This is really boring and tiring. In NFS 17, if you accidentally  found a car you like, with a few races, they will be fully ready for any race. This game, however, is more like working than racing.

Physics, controls and handling have vastly improved from its predecessor. Unlimited slots in your garage, great selection of rides, great customisation. To cut the fangirling short, I'm just going to list the few gripes I do have.

- Anemic selection of vinyls
- Forgettable soundtrack
- Cop cars have Millenium Falcon engines and cannot be simply outrun
- The Speedcross series is fun, but is crippled by the fact you're locked into driving the Countryman on its 1st completion, and the selection of like 10 cars available to buy for speedcross afterwards, making the whole thing feel a bit pointless

All the ""vanity"" customization items, such as flashy underglow neons and gimmicky car horns, are tied to them. While they are innocently cosmetic, the idea of dropping a few dollars for a [i]chance[/i] at them is utterly ludicrous and inexcusable for any game period, let alone for a primarily [i]single player[/i] game. The DLC cars, meanwhile, offer a tremendously better value for money and should be bought instead if you absolutely must drop extra money for this game.

Oh, here's the fun part. The game actively rewards you for accomplishments such as performing daily challenges and earning stars from activities with the same-said loot boxes. No exclusive decals or special cars from doing them like in previous games, just the same superficial RNG rewards the game regularly throws at you. The entire ""level-up"" mechanic is also designed wholly around dropping lootboxes for driving around and winning races, which oddly caps at level 50 but resets itself at the beginning of level 50 again perpetually every time the cap is reached so it can continue to dole out loot boxes like AOL CD's.

Okay game, though. So okay it's average.

Before anything, I highly, highly recommend playing the game with the Unite mod. Vanilla Payback is abysmal and I don't know how I managed to finish it back in 2017.

1- The game is significantly better with Unite mod. It completely overhauls the god-awful handling and fixes the stupid Gwent-esque economy, giving you lots and lots of opportunities to actually make the ride you want. I cannot express how much I hated this game but Unite guys changed my mind.

2- Story is meh like any other recent NFS games.

3- Multiplayer is surprisingly fun. It's a shame that not many playing are playing it. I suggest finding a group chat on Steam discussions.

A pretty fun story (It has some cringe parts, but to me that just makes it even more hilarious). For driving physics, it's fine. Each class of vehicles feels different, and it's fun to play around with. (For anybody that wants a blast, get the vw beetle derelict parts, the beetle handles extremely fun, almost full grip is possible)

For achievement hunters i have bad news atleast at the time of writing this review. All achievements are good, except for 2. They are multiplayer achievements. They aren't hard, but you need a minimum of 4 total people to do them. And as you might expect, the games multiplayer is pretty much dead. Luckily the online achievements are pretty easy and straightforward. You just need to complete a full playlist (speedlist), which is basically 5 events, which takes no time at all if you have the people. And the other one you need to do 10 total ranked events (not full speedlists, just 10 events). So doing 2 speedlists will get you both achievements, which doesn't take long as long as you have the 4 minimum players.

Overall i would say it's a good game to buy if you like nfs. Especially if it's on discount.",1670263220,1670263220,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Let's talk about the hate. First, Upgrading car. Instead of buying parts with money, this franchise is using gacha system. Which is you'll use this casino slot machine to get a better parts or you can get it by replaying events or doing activities. The second one, if players want to customize a car, they need to complete some missions like 'Defeat a roaming racer', 'Reach 225mph' or 'Drift for 8 seconds' something like that. And last, Collecting chips.

Now for the good part. Reason why I bought this is the story. But at the end, I felt a bit disappointed with the last chapter but it was quite good overall, I like the cutscenes & the cinematic look. And then, while customizing a car, players can use liveries/decals from community. Driving was intense (especially when car chasing or drifting). Graphics were good & beautiful for photo mode. Just get this on sale in case you want to buy.[hr][/hr]Need For Speed (2015)

There are 5 car classes (6 if you include the Deluxe content). Each class comes pre-tuned, and on top of that, you can ""live tune"" to get your desired feel for each car. 

You can get almost any car to be any discipline, which is unrealistic, but that's the point! its good fun! [spoiler]This is in direct contrast to NFS Heat, some cars in that game are perfect while others are undrivable no matter what upgrades you throw at it. Which is a huge problem when said cars are relatively expensive[/spoiler]

[h1]NFS Payback is easily my favorite of the modern nfses.[/h1]

oh yeah and ForTune Valley is pretty cool too. Story is kinda cringe but i mean, come on, it tries and i found myself quite invested in it. The things that annoy me are:
- When you crash the camera goes all wonky and doesn't immediately give you back control for dramatic effect.
- Screen shake offroad is kinda whack.
- Game crashes sometimes, and loading is always long.
- Cars aren't swappable between disciplines. Buy a new car if u wanna do a new thing with it.
- Upgrade cards are tied to the car. WHY?
- Progression in general is rubbish without mod.

[b]*with a mod installed[/b] to overhaul the awful Tune-Up Shop. Default upgrade system is the opposite of fun and ruins the experience. Consider looking up the mod. 
Note that you can still launch game without mods to avoid any crashing, and launch with mods when planning to upgrade your cars. Obviously, don't use any modded cars if you're going to turn it off.",1669451602,1669451602,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Well, this is interesting to say the least, here we have Need for Speed: Payback, a 2017 release by Ghost which developed the game, unlike some previous titles this focused a lot of single player story driver campaign... do yourself a favor and skip all cut scenes though, the story is absolute sh*t, very cringy to the point I wish the protagonist would shut the F*ck up.

Forget the story.. how the overall game and racing elements, well.. honestly pretty good, underground was better but i appreciate the overall experience, the cars look/sound good, the races can be challenging and I like the variety in all the events.

A couple things hold it back though, let talk about the card system, very unforgiving in my opinion, you get limited shipment so you are constantly upgrading 1 car at a time and if you unlock something new your grinding to get the car performance short to a level where it can compete, it turn making you buy micro transactions... f*ck that. Performance parts should be interchangeable between cars in your garage like many better titles out there, I am not paying to upgrade a car on your garbage shop EA..

Overall, I feel that EA has killed some great features here and brought about a boring story that your not invested in, given the 3$ price tag I can Over look some of the nonsense and say that for a cheap price it is good racing fun, a solid arcade racer got sure.

A solid 7/10 given you don't take it serious and forget paying extra for Microtransactions.

Tip car in each category for me
Racing - Lotus elige GT or Porsche 911 turbo
Offroad - Ford Raptor or Derelict VW beetle 
Speedcross - Mini countrymen GT
Drift -  Mazda RX7 
Runner - Derelict 1965 Mustang

Update - Nov 2022

When you get to Rep 40 + the game get super grindy, i was having issues winning basic races and getting the right missing speed card was rare, really rare and when i check the stupid shop every 10 mins the stuff is all garbage... another reason paid card systems are f*cking evil man.",1663125220,1669159384,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b]Payback is easily my favourite NFS.[/b]
Story is very relaxed and doesn't interfere with you. Literally, do whatever! 
Want to complete world activities e.g. drifting, collectibles hunt, speed cameras and alike? Go for it!
Crave for story campaign? Pick up almost any car type and in-it-for-win-it!
Or... spend hours on gambling car parts - tuning is somewhat complex and fun mini-game.

[b]The BEST of Payback:[/b]
[list]
[*]Big semi open world. Huge desert area and 3 cities in the corners
[*]Customization and tuning. Lots of stickers and physical improvements to apply and those will be rendered in the story cinematics!
[*]Different car types and hence, races. There are 5: drag, drift, off-road, race and runner. 
Plus you can complete quests for recovering derelict cars and build your own!
[*]Very simple menu to navigate and ability to replay previous challanges for a better results.

Random shit in the road to make the drive more challenging I guess?  I crashed into a barricade because the car was a brick and the cops crashed into it with me, totaled their vehicles, and I drove off.
They set up the characters with like 2 lines each then you're supposed to care about them - no.  Don't shove narrative into a game artificially like that.  Play a GTA game to see how to set up characters and stories.
I get it's supposed to be an arcade game, not Forza.  The dumbass writing and acting is cheap.  I don't care about the story, betrayal, whatever is going on, it sucks.  People like the ""started from the bottom"" style NFS.  Just some kid on the street with a $3000 Civic Si trying to make some money and get big.

The campaign is fine , not too bad. Could've probably made it longer but it's fine. 
The cars are sick .

The main big problem would be the engine upgrades which is really boring where we need to technically gamble and hope for a part without actually having to buy what we want ourselves.
The races aren't a lot but the content is enough for you to keep on playing the game for 50+hours along with multiplayer free roam.

The upgrades are pretty good when it comes to the body kits and stuff.

The game doesn't have cops roaming around though so thats one minus point too but I didnt really miss them tbh.

There are missions that involve cop chases but they are eventually scripted and when there's a couple of miles left , they'll automatically slow down lol which is kinda meh.

Overall the game is great and worth playing but I think unless you have friends too playing here , you are better off playing the newer games unless you want to play that campaign.",1666911075,1666911075,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

That game lacked anything substantial and was as hollow as games come. Payback on the other hand proved me wrong and made sure I had a damn good time during the 90+ hours that I spent in it. There's a cringeworthy story here but it somehow makes you wanna see it through to the end, and it gives you purpose to upgrade your cars and manage your team throughout different racing disciplines. The opposition gradually becomes stronger and it's up to us to keep up with them.

I love almost everything about this game, the soundtrack, car customization, the intricate and vibrant open world, decent roster of cars to choose from, fast and chaotic racing events that vary from off-roads to street racing, it's a lot of good fun.

But there is one thing I dislike a lot: The Speed Card system

Speed cards is a terrible slot machine-esque performance upgrade system which utilizes RNG and gives you random ass parts. They should've just stuck with the classic way of upgrading cars through in-game currency. It worked for over a decade in multiple NFS games, but of course, EA needed to push for the lootbox/microtransations but luckily Ghost Games went out of their way to make it as useless and irrelevant as possible. Having to rely on RNG to get the upgrades we want is horrible but at least there is little to no grind for them. I'm glad that this system was removed for NFS Heat in favor of the more grounded and straightforward system of earning money to buy the exact parts you want.

The complete vehicle customization is back again from NFS 2015, (Thank god, I don't know what the fuck Criterion and Ghost Games were thinking with Most Wanted 2012 and Rivals) The visual ways one can boost their ride are plenty. From bumpers to neons lights, there's quite a selection of things you can customize, and there really were times when Payback reminded me of the Underground era. It's also got the amazing wrap editor where you can use all kinds of decals to basically create paintings on your ride. I love it. 

The handling is very arcadey but it felt much more down-to-earth than, say, Most Wanted 2012, especially at lower levels with slower cars. The cars are no longer rockets, they won't automatically start pre-scripted drifting whenever you make a turn, The driving actually feels really nice and intuitive. Of course, it's less so when you reach McLarens, Lambos and Koenigseggs, but even those feel good to drive.

Overall, I thought Payback was gonna be another mediocre NFS game but I had a hell of a time. A really well done arcade racer.",1665908115,1665908167,True,7,0,0.592960119247436523,2,True,False,False

The visuals are good, and the cars mostly handle fine. The sound is also pretty good, but i'd suggest rising the Cop chatter sound just so you know what they have in store next corner.
Talking of cops, they are kinda underwhelming? They are scripted, only appearing when the script tell them to be there. And they are not as aggressive as some other NFS. They are not too surprising or anything.

The visual customization is pretty good (And will end up the same in Heat too), changing body parts and a pretty good decals engine, allowing to make the car as you want. Or just go to the community tab and find a cool one you like.
The performance customization though, is the opposite and pretty terrible. You get ""Cards"" that will improve your car's performance and have some random stats and brand added to it, forcing you to (literally) spin the wheel to have a chance to get something you might want. It's just bad (and made to sell lootboxes)
It's like they swapped cars performance with some kind of RPG spreadsheets.

The story is... it can be fun, with ridiculous stunt and such, but it's overall kinda bland and end in a quite odd way. Probably because the devs didn't knew how to end a story like this in a proper way.

And the driving in itself is pretty much as expected for a NFS. Arcade but not ""Mario Kart"" arcade.
Though, the cars are very ""light"" in this version and have a tendency to fly off at the first bump. Not helped by the ""Jumping"" performance stats.

In the end, it's fine. But Heat is technically better in this kind of open world racing NFS.
But if you can get it for cheap, and are curious of the ""Fast & Furious""-like story,  you can still have some fun with it.",1665163191,1665163191,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

to the game itself...
graphics are okay, but that was never really an issue in the NFS series.
the story is a boring revenge act, as already done in earlier titles and not being good.
the chases with the cops and ""house"" baddies are okay, but not that great (but better than in NFS Heat).
car customization seems okay, but not great in terms of available parts and is artificially locked behind stupid events like
""you wanna change the hood? do 3 jump events with x stars"" (just as an example, as that goes on for kinda all parts).

while it made partially sense that you needed to buy different cars for different race categories due to it being realistically being a pain to re-configure every time, it was kinda boring that not all cars were available in all shops to make hilarious builds and the upgrade cards (not actual parts) can't even be used for the same car in a different category (like an Impreca Race car to Impreza Drag) or a different car in the same category (Impreza Race to RX-7 Race).
e.g i had a Subaru Impreza in most categories where available and also a few others for shitz and giggles and each car had to get it's own upgrades...no passing down between them and due to the handful of cards being changed only every 10min and being shared across all tuning shops it was annoying. you also always start from the bottom with a new car (until you unlock & buy upgrade kits and start from level x) it's somewhat of a pain if you want to play around with different cars.

I haven't bothered with the multiplayer, as i don't care about that in such games.
so all in all it's just a EA usual mediocre cashgrab title that may be okay to buy on such a huge sale (3€ instead of 30€) but otherwise not really worth it.",1665128316,1665128316,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

An open world car game with lots of fun new cars really works well -- as it did in NFS Carbon and Undercover. A diverse set of challenges and no reliance on a player finishing one hard one makes the experience really smooth. I lost a lot and was frustrated with some of the races where the crashes were really weird, but once I got a good handle of control, it became easier. The derelict challenge is difficult and the reward is really strange, but it does provide some extra challenge in finding out how to get to weird spots.
You may notice that I leave out the story. As far as story goes, this one has a lot and I really enjoy the variety of characters. It surpasses Carbon and Undercover, which are my points of reference. The story missions are fun, but they aren't the focus. It is cool how they tried to tie everything in. The runner missions felt like they were forced, but without some help from the player, a story-based racing game just isn't going to work.

I like the fact that they let the player play as each of the three drivers. It's weird for the player to not have a single character, but it's the only way for the player to be offroad, drift, runner, and racer at the same time.

The AI is still a little off -- like a lot of NFS games. Perhaps it's just my high standard for racing AI to expect good movement. I tried a few times to get them to slow down to make it easier for me and realized that they won't do that. That's an improvement for racers who want stiff competition. Along those lines, giving yourself a weak car is a huge disadvantage, which can truly challenge a racer who feels like the competition is too easy.
That's one thing this game has in quantity: there are a ton of weak cars to drive. My first experience was noticing the high race level of the Infinity. I tried it on a race with a lot of curves and couldn't get it to turn for anything. The player is not given any feedback except losing and crashing into the guard rails. This is the sort of thing that I like to see in a racing game.
The upgrade system is slow and every new car feels like a minor improvement. This sort of slow progress is how to teach people to play better.
Lastly, the game plays well on Linux using Proton. With my video card it really goes well.

They apparently do not know that computers have a full keyboard, plus a mouse.  Also, they do not seem to understand that real games have the ability to re-bind keys to the players liking.  So these amateurs chose some very odd key bindings, & also they don't seem to understand that many would like an option to reduce or turn off the garbage music that the game keeps blaring.

When you first start the game you are restricted to the stupid key bindings they have, & there is no options to change them.  Later after you finally complete 1st chapter, then it finally gives you a chance to re-bind some of the keys.  But even more stupid is the controller binding.  It clearly shows the triggers for gas & brakes, but when in the game the left joystick controls those options, along with steering, which makes it nearly impossible to steer without messing up your speed.

And EA's requirement for Origin is another layer of crap on top of this disaster.  Origin doesn't add anything to the game, but probably makes it real easy for them to sell all kinds of information about you.

In-game controls are very, very clunky, requiring you to constantly look for their displayed bindings, since they decided it would be better to NOT use standard controls, & apparently make up random keys for doing things.

Also, so far I have not found a way to exit the game, so am always forced to use Ctrl, Alt, Delete to exit the game with Task Manager.  But at least in there I can also force close Origin, since I don't care for it being always on.

Another issue, is that the game has its own in-game voice chat, but we have not yet been able to find a way to disable it.  So we now get echos when using chat for gaming.

The story is good. For a NFS game the story isn't bad, nor are the characters that cringe.
The slot-machine upgrade system should have never left the whiteboard, but fits in the theme of the game, Vegas and stuff, so I'll give em that.
The 10$ dlc for a few cars is an insult.
The micro-transactions...just no.
The story ends on a cliff-hanger.
Graphical fidelity is more than satisfying.
Car customization is lacking.
Car selection is ok.
Music is ok-ish.
Drag racing has races with turns?
The physics need an overhaul and can be quite frustrating at times.
Still hate drift to turn. I sometimes wonder if this is the fault of the frostbite engine which was developed by dice for the battlefield series (not a racing game).
Car sound is good.

Never in my life have I wanted to quit a NFS game out of shire frustration because of the unpredictability of the physics. I play NFS games for more than 10 years now and that has never happened to me, but my curiosity prevailed.

This is a racing game not a mobile gacha game, get out with those random speed cards!

Also the drift tracks and offroad races have very janky layouts. For instance a checkpoint might have a tiny rock right in the middle of it. It looks like it's should get bumped out of the way but nope it weighs a ton and stops your car completely. Or arrows that point you all the way down a hairpin but there's no checkpoint there, so you can actually skip the hairpin altogether. Or drift tracks that say you should go left but there's a truck parked right in front of the entrance.

Ashpalt racing seems ok. The car sounds and arcadey driving feel and customization and graphics are good too.

Story aside, the fact that this game doesn't even have first person camera just s0cks, wtf is bumper camera? hood camera? not really playing race car games but do people drove with these camera? Like cmon, i remember i have a better race car games back in my psp.

The garage systems are also weird, cars were divided into different categories like race, runner, drag, drift and offroad. But there are same cars? Why do u have to buy the same cars for different purpose. The map wasn't that specified as well. RACE route using DRIFT route, OFFROAD also using DRIFT route as well, part of RACE route having some part of offroad as well. My drift car can definitely run in RACE game.

The last NFS game I played was NFS: Underground over 10 years ago, so I was eager to see how the game evolved from then.
After playing for a couple of hours, I could see that it didn't evolve at all. Like its predecessors, NFS: Payback is an arcade open-world driving simulation. Realism doesn't have anything to do with this game - there is no car damage, all cars behave the same way and the physics are really bad. Most of the time, you'll get better results just crashing into the opponent than trying to outdrive them. The same goes for difficult curves - just touch the handbrake and hit the railing, the car magically goes through the curve.
The game consist of a bunch of story-driven races divided into several categories. The story is so lame and meaningless that I won't even mention the details. The car upgrade mechanics are terrible. The music soundtrack is even worse than terrible... I actually don't remember ever playing a game with such a lousy soundrack. I had to lower the music volume to 0 because I couldn't listen to that garbage, and played through the whole game like that.
Still, not everything in the game is bad. The graphics are decent and the game is relatively fun. The feeling of speed and acceleration you'll experience while playing was also done pretty well. For 3$, I guess that's enough.

Need for Speed: Payback is good for a bit of mindless fun, but nothing more than that.

[h1]Cons[/h1] 
- Origin
 
[h1]Summary[/h1] 
It's a NFS alright? It feels pretty much identical to any previous one. Which is not a bad thing if it's what you are looking for.
 
The driving model is far from perfect, cars feel slow and heavy. It is very arcade racing.
I was also not a huge fan of drifting.
 
Car customization is decent for the number of cars available.
 
Pretty underwhelming story, but NFS was never about a story anyway.
 
Multiplayer feels a bit forced since there is not much to do and only 3 modes are available if I am not mistaken. It would not surprise me if it got shutdown anytime soon.
 
To be fair, I had not a single issue with the Origin launcher, the only minor annoyance was that the game appeared to launch twice if I did not have Origin open. But I know that launchers are make or break situation for some people.
 
There are a lot of better racing games, but if you are looking for some silly fun arcade racing game and manage to grab this in 80-90% sale I am sure it will be worth it.

Gonna start with the cons:

- Hate the Trade-In Card Upgrade, this was the start of EA being the BS publisher, (same year as EA SWBF2
- Fortune Valley was...... meh? Maybe i play too much games including Las Vegas inspired map so
- some issue for me regarding bugs, when s*** goes down, sometimes going into the tunnel, it blocks you
- some activities (speed, drift, jump) can be a b**ch, especially that damn U-Turn speed zone/trap/whatever you called.
- Shipments, why

Then the Pros:

- Car lists are aight, not the best but im fine with it.
- Speedcross are fun, nuff said
- Some cool reference from previous NFS games in there

So far the soundtrack is forgettable. Driving on controller has felt smooth. It's not exactly realistic but as someone who enjoyed NFSU, 2 and MW back in the days, this feels pretty solid when it comes to just driving and racing.

The customization aspects, all of it, feels clumsy, and it's damn unfortunate because I was looking forward to that. But for the driving and story that seems okay, 3 bucks was perfectly fine to scratch that itch.

There's DLC, one is a car-pack (no idea if they're anything interesting) and one is simple marker unlock, which is simply a convenience thing, because you can unlock all of them by just playing.

EDIT: The game does have some technical difficulties with certain CPUs. Basically alt-tabbing over play session of some hours will ultimately lead to WMI Provider Host use all of the CPU available, forcing you to reboot. Found couple of tips for it, with one being playing in Windowed mode, and another creating an user.cfg file. While the video is for Heat, it seems to work for Payback as well. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuPL-tVYCSI

EDIT2: Just have finished the story. This playtime is 95% just for story and the failed instances, didn't focus much on collecting things or maxing out challenges. No grind either. For the story, I'd say it's pretty good for what to expect in game like this.

Wow, NFS has really lost their touch. Third party launcher was their first strike. Then the incredibly long unskipable intro pictures which are just black and white cheap trash, followed by a suuuper long wait time just to get into the game. Hope you don't like any kind of realistic physics! Total arcade game. Dialogue PATHETIC (Though honestly need for speed dialogue has ALWAYS been trash even in my favourites like the almighty NFS underground 2 and most wanted (ORIGINAL)). Forced diversity as part of the current ongoing trend, surprised there were no quadroplegic drivers just to round out their overinclusive crap even more. Giant blue markers to show you where to go a la games from back in like 2000. Completely barebones settings and can't even assign my fucking gamepad buttons! Very lazy, total cash grab. ONLY redeeming feature is the fact that it looks incredible on my computer and runs at a staggeringly high framerate. Of course, what does that matter when the source content is arcade garbage for the supremely idiotic masses? What ever happened to originality and making games for the PLAYERS.... EA can shove a spiked shock collar so far up their tightwad asses that they're spitting arcs and shitting out even WORSE games than this.

A heads up: I played this AFTER playing nfs heat and I have to say this: if you ever get into a situation where you gotta choose between this and Heat, 100% no doubt pick heat. It's just better at, like, ALMOST EVERYTHING.

With that said, let's officially get started with the review.

So NFS Payback came out in 2017 to... mixed opinions. And mixed opinions I do have, because whew, this is not a simple game to review.
Let me start with the positives: it's... fun, actually! Yes ladies, gentlemen, and everything in between: it's a fun game. It drives fun, the map is cool, it looks good, and it has all the things you love: insane visual and body customization, decent enough collectibles, good music (for the most part)... 

And a decent story. Yeah, I like the story in NFS Payback. I see it for what it is; an interesting idea, that is crippled and beat up beyond recognition by a bunch of shitty characters. This game's tone's real problem is the CHARACTERS. Because, like, a story about a crew that get used by a dar underground organization that rigs every race in the city and controls basically all the industry and politics and money of the place, and then they decide to bring it down to the ground by smashing their rigged races and beating their bought crews? Sign me the FUCK up, dude. It's a fun concept, and you can't tell me otherwise. The problem here is that it's played in the worst most cringe inducing way possible by a cast of characters that DO NOT BEHAVE LIKE THEY SHOULD FOR THE TONE OF THE STORY. [spoiler] But I love Mac. Mac is a cutie, he has a couple of embarrasing lines here and there but he is BY FAR the best character out of the entire story. [/spoiler]. Jess is a maniac at the wheel, she's edgy, constantly angry and acts like she's mentally insane, but she isn't. She isn't awful but she definitely isn't great, either. And she's the worst proliferator of what I'm gonna call ""MCU Humor"". You probably know what I mean. Tyler is just generally embarrasing. He has it all: stupid one-liners, dialogue that makes you wonder if he was written by a fourteen year old or an extremely disconnected forty year old in a suit. Rav is just kinda stereotypical: ""Oh I have a background with the army so I know everything about tech"" which... doesn't really make a lot of sense. (But I might be missing details, so feel free to call me out on anything). And Lina Navarro... Man. She's just so nonsensical. She starts as this lady who literally just hits you up for a job that backfires on you and then she becomes the main antagonist for a while until then you learn that there's another even worse, even evil-er guy that controls her from the shadows... and who has an awful fake asian accent. And then they tell you, AT THE END, that Lina was like, Tyler and Jess' childhood friend??????? And they raced together?????? But they don't tell you why or how they split up, they don't go in depth about anything when it could have actually been cool. It's just kinda there. It feels shoehorned, like a last attempt at making some dramatic revelation???? But it really isn't, it's just kinda lame, and it made me feel nothing. Hell, the curator is more interesting! The Broker is more interesting and you never even see her face!!!!! I truly believe they fundamentally messed up Lina's character and they just made her the big bad because they needed a big bad. Very sad. 
The last character with relevance that I wanna talk about is the Gambler. Marcus Weir is... fine, I guess. He's fun from time to time. But that's it. Just like Lina, he's kinda more plot device than character. And yes, I know what you're gonna say, ""are you looking for coherent and well thought out plot in a driving game"", to which I say YES, YES I AM, because I may not have had to pay 60 dollars for this, but other people did and I am sure their disappointment must have been IMMENSELY BIGGER than mine. 
The rest of characters are more secondary and they are kinda just there to fill up space. Funnily enough, I believe they are decent. The accomplish their purpose: giving the bosses you race a personality so you can feel like you are taking down an actual person. It's a shame then that like half of them are just ridiculous and, worst of all, so INSANELY BAD at what they do that, when they talk smack at you during a race, it feels like a joke because here's this guy telling you about how you actually are an awful racer and they are going to grind you to dust and like, you are a whole two kilometers ahead of them. It kinda sucks. It doesn't make me feel like I'm beating a cool race against an interesting rival, it makes me feel like I'm listening to the most unfunny comedy routine in recent memory. And it's made even worse by the fact that both Tyler and Mac ALWAYS have a response prepared in the form of a one liner, a weird joke that doesn't land that well, or worse: Tyler just going ""They were SO good jess they had me agains the wall back there wowzers"" after you beat them and sometimes even lapped them. 

But I have talked enough about the narrative side of the game. It is now time for us to take a look at the other, [b] OBJECTIVELY WORSE [/b] part of the game, and the main complaint that everyone has (and for good reason):

[h1] THE UPGRADE SYSTEM. [/h1] 

So I don't really know what was going through the developer's heads when they thought that it was a good Idea to leave the upgrades (you know, the main thing that lets you win the game?) COMPLETELY UP TO RNG. I am completely baffled at the fact that in order to upgrade your rides you have to PICK A RANDOM CARD AFTER A RACE and PLAY SLOTS IF YOU WANT MORE. Or you could also try your luck at the shop, and pray that they have what you need and not something that [b] resembles [/b] what you need but also terribly cripples some other aspect of your ride. I absolutely positively no doubt about it HATE THIS THING WITH A PASSION. It's so unintuitive, so unnecessary, so generally BAD. And, the worst part in my opinion is the disconnect that it creates between you and your ride. An integral part of the fun of customising rides in these games is that you upgrade them the way you want. But not in this game! in this game, you upgrade based on what the game feels like. And if you don't, [b] wait eight minutes until the shop refreshes. [/b] 

Oh, and did I mention that upgrades are not only individual and untransferrable to other cars, but also, untransferrable between CAR CLASSES????

[h1] THE CAR CLASS SYSTEM. [/h1] 

Let me say that I do have mixed feelings about this. Well, mostly negative feelings, but I guess it has some redeeming factors to it. So, in this game, your cars are divided in classes. Race, Drift, Offroad, Runner, Speedcross and Drag. By this I don't mean that there's a pool of cars from which you can choose the one's you like and then use them in any category, oh goodness no, that would make this a non-issue. Instead, SOME cars are available in each category. You cannot IMAGINE my sadness when the game told me I had unlocked the Corvette Grand Sport and I thought ""Oh I'm gonna get one of these for the Runner class. Running away from cops in a corvette sounds fun"" only to face the harsh reality that [b] the Corvette isn't in the Runner class. [/b] It is in the Drift class though, which makes NO sense, in my opinion. I ended up getting it for the Race class and just got a Mustang for my getaway duties. Add to this nonsense the fact that speed cars cannot be transferred between cars or classes and you have a recipee for disaster. At least let me use ALL my speed cards in ALL my cars... But no, that would make too much sense. 

In conclussion... I had fun. But I that doesn't mean that it's good. Get Heat instead, or, if you really want this one, wait until it has like a 90% discount. At least the music selection is better than Heat's. Lol.

Game is fun with mods that greatly fixes it foockin issues, it's completely enjoyable for real!!!

But without mods?? Holy foock goodluck having fun without them🤣

Here's some things that mods defnitely helped me out with:
-- The DLC cars bundle, you can unlock that with a mod.
-- the foockin Fortune Valley map shortcut DLC, unlockable with mod also.
-- The ""Slot Machine"" car upgrade system, mods fix that nonsense crap.
-- The car ""ride height"" where you just wanna lower the car but not with the ugly stance that the game does everytime you adjust ride height. mod fixes that shittness.
-- The foockin car parts where you have to do certain task so you can customize that part, fixed with mods as well.
-- The cash grind!!! I dunno about you but I always want to finish the main story first before doing side quest and shiitt to every game with a story I play. mod fixes this too.
--No space allowed in license plate??? I used a mod and fixed this shiitt.
-- limited slot in car wraps, fixed by a mod.

Those are just some things that I didn't like about the game and with the help of mods they are easily fixed. The mods honestly makes you enjoy the game to what it literally suppose to be.

So yeah, go buy it while it's down to 2 dollars, install Frostbite Mod Manager, sign up for NexusMods or whatever nfs modding site you prefer. Download and install mods! That's it, enjoy the foockin game bruhh👍

It ain't bad as most people say (specially for 2 foockin dollars right now), they just don't know how to make it enjoyable🤣",1663065692,1663065692,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story is god awful, and the voice acting is cringey as hell (mainly for the writing). The singleplayer isnt very long and theres only as many race events as the story lasts, theres nothing afterwards, no more events to do, the game saves giving you the best cars and then theres no single player content to do with them besides pretty uninspired freeroam events.
That said, at its core its still a pretty fun arcadey racing game that will give you a few hours of drifting rounds corners for your money.
That said, if you can get Criterion's entries into the nfs series (Most Wanted, Hot Pursuit) I'd go for those first, they're alot more content rich for the singleplayer side of things and just better games.

Multiplayer does seem to still have some people playing (I dont know if thats just a result of the games current low price or if people do actually play generally), and its pretty fun for what it is. Though some people have no chill and seem to have just chosen violence. Thats not the games fault though.

Why do these games with open worlds never have one uber race at the end of the game that circles it in a huge marathon race... Hot Pursuit had one, Most Wanted had one. Just give me a big huge long final event otherwise why even bother being open world, just make bespoke tracks at that point.",1663027462,1663027462,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Spent the day installing them and trying them out, having fun even. 
I had some pretty old obscure stuff, that ended up being great little hidden gems - so I was happy at this point.  Saved this one for last because I figured it would be the best one of the bunch - always loved the NFS series.
Then I came to this garbage title that keeps crashing with my gx card.
And this is suppose to be a quality EA AAA title and franchise ?!?!
My 'crappy' old indie games I just bought were better than this one !!!

Finally figured out the DirectX problem was due to some stupid setting on my page file that never bothered any of the other 350+ games I have - that was a tough one to figure out!
Got the game going and was then bombarded with loud rap music...I really, really hate rap 'music'.
Fought with the terrible menu system to turn off the music, mouse is disabled in these games now, it seems.  Had to task kill the game several times to get it to stabilize, settings just right and to load quickly.
Got the story going at last...but the characters and story is terribly stupid, shallow and just annoying as hell, plus I was forced to listen to rap music, so by now I'm really pissed off.
But at least I can drive a straight line now....yay, now I know for sure its not my computer or me!
 
I used to like the Need for Speed franchise, I've owned several older titles that were much better and I even liked the music enough to put them on my personal music player for rl driving.  But in Hot Pursuit Remastered version I had problems with just driving straight - I was all over the road, can't get anywhere. I thought it was either me or my controller, so I bought  a new controller...no difference, never figured it out - it's still totally unplayable to this day.  
Now I find my controller works just fine in Heat, so it wasn't me, it was the game.  Unfortunately, Heat is not an improvement for me - I just want the fun I used to have with the old series running from the cops while trying to win a race with expensive sport cars.

But...I guess this is the crap kids like now days...deep sigh.

Glad it was only $3 because this is the LAST of the NFS  franchise I ever buy and EA even for a while - nothing else they have looks even a bit interesting and I'm STILL pissed at them for canceling Earth & Beyond MMO years ago....and oh, did I mention I really hate rap music ?!?!",1662874047,1662961227,False,3,2,0.537329137325286865,0,True,False,False

Only bought this because of the -90% sale, I was not even interested in it but still decided to give it a try and to my surprise It was quite Fun especially the Drifting, with the easy arcade style handling, chaining drifts was a breeze which gave me feel good hormones, so good job. On the other hand rest of Events like Race, Offroad, Drag and Police were okay I guess, because they required more upgrades for the cars which let me tell you is not good as the upgrading system is card-based trash, Its good that with deluxe version you dont have to grind all but still finding the right combos of the SpeedCards was pain in the ass as you have to wait for the shop to restock. Now for the story, same old NFS Cringe, I just blasted my own music in the Background so that I don't have to listen to some dialogues, Still there are some very Epic Set-pieces in the story. Cops are f-king crazy and Car-customisation is dope as usual.

Only had one game breaking glitch after the final drag race on chapter 5 where I had to just mash any button to get the game out of a darkened screen where you couldn't do anything, then it progressed.

Last NFS I played was 2015 and it feels way more polished then that but the tight areas on this map with police or races always ended up in carnage whether that was on car flying and making you lose all momentum or it was a racer bumping a wall and blocking everyone from moving.

Now for the review...

For 2 USD, this game has very excellent value for money. Someone who hasn't played PayBack before might like it more because of the price xD.

The biggest PROS of this game are story and progression system.
Bosses, head to head runs, stars progress etc etc. It feels good seeing progression in every little thing. This thing is better than even NFS HEAT and FORZA HORIZON 5.

CONS :
Since, being an NFS, this game is filled with arcade physics. People may or may not like it since FORZA HORIZON 4 is been on steam for than 1.5 years now and that also sells for very cheap. 

Game isn't that good looking for a 2017 title. FORZA HORIZON 3 from 2016 looks way better than this.

Characters have very cringy dialogues and they keep saying cringy shit all over race multiple times. It's cancer to Human Ears.

I never thought I'd say this, but - this game has good driving. The car control is much more balanced and intuitive than most modern NFS games. You still have to do dumb stuff to go fast, like use boost and drift on every corner, but it's less obnoxious than most NFS. You can actually win by knowing a car's handling, rather than just being stupid aggressive.

My biggest gripe with this game is it locks every activity behind a car/event class system. You wanna use your WRX to haul ass in a street Race or smash a Drift record? Too bad, your WRX is classified as ""Offroad"" only. Hey, that's a bitchin 69' Charger you have! I bet that beast pulls a nice 1/4 mile time - But you wouldn't know, because you can't use it in ""Drag"" events. 

You cannot convert car class. However, you're welcome to buy the exact same car again in another class. What?! This confusing system is ultimately meaningless because you can't tune or mod anything exactly the way you want, anyways - there's no actual car tuning, and all upgrades revolve around a wack-ass card based system. The game takes place in Vegas, but come on! 

If you want to beat the game and unlock everything, well then strap in for some tedious stuff. A lot of event types don't feel like actual racing. Instead of a free-flowing driving experience, they are short-sighted trial-and-error runs where you have to micro-manage every move you make in order to meet some minimum score requirement. I'd rather be in an event where crossing the finish line first is what matters, and drive how the **** I want. 

The best ""mission"" moments in this game are where you are racing wheel-to-wheel at high speeds on the open road - Evading and ramming police and thugs into oblivion, triggering real-time cinematic cutscenes. That may sound dumber than the stuff I'm complaining about having to do, but it's 1000 times more satisfying than jumping through repetitive checkpoint hoops in an attempt to rack up points on a clock.

Anyways, this game feels great when it lets you onto the open road - but it's a rare opportunity among race/mission classes that are a total grind, and basically nonexistent performance customization/tuning.

Okay, i will start this by mentioning, i played NFS series since the first one, obviously, i got old and boomery so after Most Wanted (2005) came out i got disappointed, and ever since, NFS games stopped being one of my favourite franchises.
Anyhow, few days ago i caught this on a -90% sale, for 3$ i couldn't turn it down, i gave it a try thinkig ""Ey, what the hell, let's see what's new"".

And that's when i became a junkie.

In just few days i managed to play like 53 hours almost. I got hooked up on it like crazy.

My complaints are related mostly to the extra challenges (speedruns, drift challenges, jumps), if you want to get all the achievements/completely finish the game you have to do those, they're hell on earth. I would gladly spend 3 days in a jail instead of doing them. I am not a very good player (in my recent years i becamme a filthy casual), but still, they're just badly designed with big requirements.
I am almost certain the devs haven't done them themselves to see if they're even remotely feasible. And i read that previously, devs that worked on NFS series said that they were kinda forced into just releasing the games, and not polish them accordingly, i don't know if that's the case but i think it's likely.

Now, most people don't care about achievements or extra completion bullshit, i like to call them 'the happy ones'.

Another thing that kinda bugs me is that, it's a street racing game, right? Then why the hell do we have to go through so many checkpoints, it kinda beats the ""street racing"" vibe when you have to do things accordingly, there are just few shortcuts that aren't really shortcuts, you can easily miss these checkpoints, and you have to go back to them, which obviously, is as stupid as it sounds.

Story is a cringefest to say the least, i swear to God, it's like 2002 called and wanted Vin Diesel from XXX back. 
All the dialogues and pseudo-machoism you'd expect from that movie, or from the Fast and Furious series. 

It didn't bother me, though, it was so bad it was funny as hell.
Luckily, it's NFS. Nobody in this damn world that plays it gives a quarter of a fuck about the story.

Overall, the game is really solid, graphics are good, it just feels right playing it, cars don't have that sluggish wanna-be racing sim feeling.
I would definitely recommend people to play it, especially old-farts (I am not even that old, but sometimes i feel like it..) like me that got to the point they're too boomery to enjoy ""modern"" games anymore.

Gameplay: 8/10
Graphics: 7/10
Story: Vin Diesel/10

For the people that don't feel like reading an entire review, i will make few short points:

The bad:
- The extra challenges for achievements are awfully bad, tiring and too much
- Multiplayer is almost dead, at least on Ranked, not sure about the casual
- Checkpoints in races, and no ""real"" shortcuts
- Sometimes, slow loading screens even on a good computer where the game is also installed on the SSD

The good:
- If you pay attention to dialogues and cutscenes, you will feel the power of Great Van Diesel the 1st flow through you, you will hear Britney Spears in your head and a Nokia 3310 will spawn in your hand.
- I think there are lots of cars, that will appeal to every sort of category of people. You can even make Ted Bundy's beetle, or if you didn't have luck trading crypto or stocks the last few years, you can at least get a lambo in NFS.
- Lots of customizations (I wish there were more options when placing decals, to alter their shape only horizontally for example)
- Solid handling and feel when driving. It feels like NFS again, it's almost perfect.
- Plenty of stuff to do in free-roam
- It has a pretty easy learning/getting-used-to curve

I really enjoyed my time with this game, and i hope you will too!
Have a great day and thanks for reading my ramblings.

The map is Forza Horizon inspired especially because you can do offroad races or combined and the events are very fun to drive in, especially the offroad races. 

My biggest gripe is having to buy duplicate cars for 4 different events: Offroad, Racing, Drifting, and Runner. You could modify the cars in NFS HEAT to be any of those and not have to buy duplicates, but then again this game was before heat and luckily they fixed that. 

Now the upgrading system is wack and the game makes you grind for both ""speedcards"" and money and that feels like a chore (screw you EA), but with the UNITE mod, you only have to grind for the money and then go to a tune up shop to buy the parts because they are all unlocked so you could even make your starter car a beast if you wanted to!  

The campaign, or singleplayer part, is basically Fast and Furious meets The Italian Job. Story is nothing special or original but it is better than Heat and NFS 2015. It's action packed, exciting moments, and not a dull moment, at least for the most part. Characters are alright, but the voice acting is terrible as if they are reading off the script without emotion so do not expect oscar worthy level of VA, although I keep hearing Ian Mcshane iwhenever the character ""Rav"" speaks and even sorta resembles him. 

One of the coolest parts of the game is you can race with your friends in alldrive multiplayer and set custom Starting/ Finish lines to race all around the map. So get your friends to try it with you after all, the game is 3 bucks until September 15th, or wait for the next sale.

Overall, solid racing game, cars are customizable so you can make them look however you like, but get the UNITE mod in order to enjoy the game the way it was meant to be (although the car tuning should have been as deep like NFS HEAT's).

I couldn't find the menu first, but issue was just dumb. Esc does nothing, because who in their right mind would try that for getting to the menus or exiting the game?? No sirree, thats' Tab you want for that. 

However the sound issue is worse than I expected. Not only do I get no sound in the game, I need to restart my PC to get the sound back after running NFS PB, most likely because it messes with the sound drivers and makes sound go somewhere else, and what's worse it seems to have messed with my app-specific sound settings in Windows unless that's an incredible coincidence. 

Also, even if I hadn't had these bugs, I can run the game pretty smooth on all ultra settings 1440p, however cutscenes are choppy and laggy. What's that about? 

And even if everything worked, I really really don't like being forced into several on-rails prologue missions like I've never played a racing game before. 

And even if I could just race, why are they talking as if I must take care not to damage the vehicle, but if I hit a wall I just bounce around? It's like my car is an indestructible object with a plow up front for any poor sod that thinks to front-collide with me.

And finally, why on earth are the default M&KB keybindings that you drive and steer with the arrow keys? Do nobody at EA play computer games? WASD people. WASD.

If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.


Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

What I don't like is that the cars and drivers in the game are speeding and the reason I don't like this is because the speed limits are set in place by law for a reason.

Payback is yet another rather ""mid"" Need For Speed game, which is pretty common for a lot of 'em, really. There's a few things it does well, like good GFX that actually runs decently at 60fps on any decent & current mid-range PC, and car handling is also pretty alright...
 
...on the ""Racing"" discipline. You see, the game separates races through several categories, denoting the environment and mechanics. Racing is your usual road fare, Drifting is the sliding your car around mode, and Undercover is the mode where you evade the cops. I'd say those are pretty alright.
Then there's Drag racing. On it's own, it's pretty similar to how it worked in NFS:Underground (at least as I faintly remember)...but for some reason, the game insists on some of the ""Drag"" races being...well, actual races, and the cars absolutely suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck at turning. And there are turns in those races.
And then there's Off-Road. It handles how'd you expect of off-road racing, except it ain't great when the game LOVES to litter the track with pebbles that can crash your car on a narrow rocky track, and you're sliding all over the place.
 
And then there's the cars themselves. Most of the cars can be used across multiple disciplines...if you're willing to re-buy them per discipline. The upgrade system is also, basically, lootboxes. Yeeeap. At least they give you parts at the end of each race, but the races start outpacing your rank the further you progress through the game, which they expect you to close that gap by grinding out events. No thanks, easy mode set, complete the races.
I'm also not super impressed by the car lineup. A Car game without a McLarenF1 at this point is like...ooof.
 
Well, I rant all that, but they're not insurmountable dealbreaker issues, I think. The rest of the game is...alright. The story is the usual ""NFS RYCER"" inoffensive shlock, the soundtrack is your usual racing lineup stuff... and I guess unlike that other Need For Speed I had to refund, the controller actually works!
 
Anyways, if you can get it on super cheap like I did, it's not a bad buy, but it's pretty much nowhere near the quality of Hot Pursuit. If you're willing to splurge more and don't have it, get that one, otherwise, this is...a pretty ok get too.

游戏模式单一、重复。任务无聊。
车辆购买以及改装繁琐。同一种型号的要买四辆，配件还不能通用，要重新刷。非要区分什么公路车逃逸车越野车甩尾车。越野车单独拆分出来也就算了，我理解，但是另外三种不能通用还要重复购买，就离谱。 
改装车：如果你要改装零件获得性能上的提升，只能使用卡片，有两种办法获得：一，在商店购买，买空了就等补货；二，在商店抽奖。卡片最高有18个等级，最多能提升三项能力。但是卡片是不通用的，如果你买了公路车的保时捷911，你的卡片不能使用在甩尾车的保时捷911上，只能单独另买。这点非常坑人而且无聊，丝毫没有乐趣。
另一种改装是单纯外表的改装，你可以改轮胎，改尾翼，改刹车盘，但是这些都只能带来外观的改变，丝毫不影响性能。非常离谱。不明白为啥非要拆分成这两个部分，弄得两个部分都没有乐趣。抽卡没有乐趣。改装外观本来应当带来性能的提升，但是也没有，很失望。以前的作品明明不是这样的。
故事俗套陈旧。一个复仇的故事，妹子不能泡，最后通关只得到一辆车，惨。

Unrealistic driving, slow feel no mater how fast you go, unlimited nitrous boost and no car damage. Story? Pppfft. Who cares. But its a guilty fun i enjoy. 

This game however in particular is especially problematic because EA.... You suck EA... And Origin game launcher makes other launchers whos names i won't mention but they start with a *pic and a ***soft, look like really great fleshed out feature rich launchers with no bugs or lag whatsoever. Having said that.
This game will occasionally not work. Like at all. Like i spent an hour going over fixes for a game released late 2017. Wanna know what the issue was? EA launcher didn't know where the game was located! So for those of you who bought this at 3 dollars or are thinking about it but heard there are issues my fix was simple. Go into EA launcher, go to game properties and add -datapath ""C:\WHEREVER YOU HAVE STEAM INSTALLED\steamapps\common\Need for Speed Payback"" to the command line. Now the game works. Buy it for 3 dollars. Spend nothing extra. EA deserves nothing.

Let me just start by saying that I played the first hour of the game vanilla. The story is a joke that could be overlooked because stories in racing games are just background noise but they actively force you to bear the cringe. Characters are all cliché and are all there to make you feel special, you're ""the best driver in town"", you're just awesome, please continue to play our game. They actually tried to play the anti-hero ""not my fight"" thing with the Main Character, when he basically had no other option and the suggestion made was what he wanted anyway??? it's ridiculous. And they keep calling you while you're driving saying the most horrid things imaginable, worse than Guantanamo bay sound torture.

The handling is atrocious. The game actively helps you steer to the point where you barely have to do anything. The handbrake makes the car extra grippy and allows you to make 90degree corners at 120mph, usually faster than how you were going in a straight line. The action is all scripted, so your opponents will go past you at 200mph but then slow to a crawl once you're close to the finish line, cops will disappear once you're close to the designated area. A joke. Then I got to the drifting part and I couldn't even make one drift, the car was just too grippy. I couldn't understand what I was supposed to do because the car doesn't behave anything like it should. I quit and installed UNITE mod. Day and night difference. Improvement in graphic details and sounds but the handling is miles better: wheelspin on acceleration, I was actually able to drift and beat the ""score"" by 5x times, then I got to the normal grip racing style, no more handbraking shenanigans, car would do what I was actually trying to do. Offroad racing seemed a little bit off, and cop chases still have the cop cars going insanely fast just to be ahead of you. The car customization seemed good from the little I've seen and there are very cool community liveries. In the end this feels like trying to be Forza Horizon and failing or underachieving at everything, there's nothing that it does better than FH and nothing really revolutionary either. 

What made me uninstall and refund the game was entering the game on a second time and seeing a black lives matter ad in the main menu. This bigotry and anti-White hatred cannot be allowed in video games.",1662262376,1662425125,False,3,0,0.438062518835067749,1,True,False,False

I was hoping the combat would make up for this, but it didn't. Cars feel off, floaty/ not even in their environment. Better music than a few games after it. VERY poorly optimized. I'd say, YES of course its worth 3 bucks, but its not worth your time. There are far older racing games that are better in every way.

Here's a tip: Overspec the Offroad car, because those are annoying as f*ck. But you can underspec the others, one thing you gotta do is to have same brand parts 6 times to get a bonus that basically makes your car better than it actually is.

The thing most annoying and frustrating is the navigation system whereby you can see a spot you need to get to, but there is no clear way on the map as to how to get there. It places a marker but, unlike race events, garages, etc., it does not give you a line on the road to follow.

It is such an obvious console port that no time and thought has been given to incorporating mouse control, especially on the map and options screens.

- I do like the cars you can drive. There are a wide variety of vehicles you can choose from.
- The vast car customization are really epic and amazing .
- Tune up cards are quite good but sometimes, they're a bit of a let down.
- I really love the map size, since I'm a guy who really gets amazed on big and huge maps.
- Interesting story but I wish is was more longer.
- I like the driving mechanics, but it does really need some skill to drive well, especially offroad, which is not a hassle for me, I can get used to this.
- AI racers and police has never been forgiving in this game, they really need to chill.

Now the main part of this review:

One thing that really pisses me off is that they never let the abandoned cars stay in the game after like 2 and a half years and it's most likely rigged and unfair for late and new players like me who are really astonished to those cars (such as the M3 GTR, Underground 2 350z, etc). So why still bother selling this game when in the end, you'll just disappoint and piss off your new players all because you removed something really that matters the most in the game. Well you're EA afterall so I'm getting used to all of your bullshit. Istg please bring back the abandoned cars, idc if this game is really old enough for you but you're still selling this so be much more responsible what your new game buyers want on your game.",1656517131,1656518738,False,26,2,0.667836427688598633,0,True,False,False

A lot of people hate the soundtrack in this game, however in my opinion, it's pretty all right. I'm not saying it's better than the OG ""I'm Rock"" or more OG ""Black Betty"", but there are a few decent tracks in this game. Also the sound design is not bad, however there are times, when engine sounds for certain cars sounds exactly same or some moaning or shouting sounds ridiculous, but still it's all right.

About the story, it's not the most deepest thing ever, there are few black holes in it, where the plot either not makes any sense or just the characters do something stupid, but still better than the 2015 NFS's story by a mile. There are a few smaller twist, but in general it's pretty simple. Characters are not deep at all, some of them pretty annoying, because of their ""cool"" lines, but at the end, I was all right with them. Probably my favorite characters from the game is the Curator and Marcus Weir. If you want to play a NFS game because of it's story, except a really simple and most of the time weak story from this game, but for a NFS, it's okay.

Graphics in this game is okay. There are lot of graphical bugs, either textures don't want to load in at all, bushes goes into the air or the camera goes through the level, it's all in the game, but these are not that common. I was okay with it throughout the game.

The controls of this game is... not the most pleasant thing in the universe. You can control your car decently, but my biggest issue was with the turning and drifting. The game has the break-drift mechanic from 2015 NFS game, which I wasn't the biggest fan of, but here drifting is essential for taking some corners, however at the beginning, it was a pain to get use to and I had a really hard time to even race properly. Also, every damn car is under steering in this game, it's impossible to take corners without drifting or owning a decent car. However, I around mid game, I started to get use to it and it was okay, however it's a really weird to control these cars in this game, comparing to other racing games.",1656194141,1656194141,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's all just for applying cosmetics and playing with the wrap editor. Don't get me wrong, customization and everything else is fantastic. It's just the upgrades that are the worst part of Payback and aside from customizing, your garage is only used to manage cars.

Before you read this, i need to tell you that i have no experience on playing the previous Need for Speed games that came before Payback. The last Need for Speed game that i played was Need for Speed Most Wanted (2012), and the game that felt (almost) similar to Payback for me was the trio of the most famous Need for Speed (Underground 2, Most Wanted 2005, and Carbon).

This game sets on Fortune Valley, a fictional place based from Las Vegas. As someone who grew up playing some of the famous Need for Speed games (such as NFSMW 2005, NFS Underground 2, NFS Carbon), the world in this game is pretty huge. Aside from the fact that most of the place is winding roads and deserts, i have to admit that the world in this game is amazing, with day and night cycles, something you don't get in previous NFS installments.
The handling of the car is pretty good, but kinda hard if you're on keyboard and don't have enough experience with it. Still, i spent 20 hours in game playing with keyboard and it's more than enough for me. Probably because i have played previous NFS with keyboard as well. (Controller is recommended). 
The cars that available in game, well, not that bad, but can be better. The customization is pretty decent. The wrap editor is pretty cool in my opinion, just like what we had back then with NFS Carbon but much more complete. However, there is lack of choice for parts. Yes you can modify different parts of the car, but with lack of options in each parts felt disappointing.  Another disappointing thing is that there are 5 type of cars (Drag, Drift, Runner, Race, Offroad), and every car is locked in its own type. Like, why can't i bring my Porsche for runner or drift?
One big problem with this game is the Speed Card (if you ever played Need for Speed No Limits, you'll be familiar with this).  Speed Card is annoying. It's like ""hey i wanna upgrade my car"" and the game will be like ""yes but now i can only downgrade it or wait for like 8 minutes maybe i will give upgrade options lmao""
The story felt a bit short, as well. I'm in chapter 3 and the character development of the antagonist felt a bit off, like the dev could do better with it even if it increases the amount of time to finish it.

Overall, 6.5/10 from me for this game. Why i recommended it? because if you wanna enjoy modifying the visual parts of your car, enjoying the scenery, or just cruising around, this game can do the stuff. But in other things, mehh, no. 
Oh ya, i don't recommended it in full price, but i do recommend it when it's on sale with more than 50% discount.

After I realized that, I was hesitant to play because of negative feedback I heard about it, but I'm glad I gave it a try. There are differences between the 3 but they're not so radical that you feel like it's a completely different game. 
The good:
- the story of Payback. I like the story of both Payback and Heat better than 2015
- Mechanics of driving are basically the same between the 3, with a few changes in certain controls, for instance shifting gears I think 2015 had it as up and down on the d-pad, Payback is Y and B, and Heat had RB and LB (using Xbox controller)

The Different (not necessarily good or bad):
- parts are levelled 1-18, while 2015 and Heat both have fewer tiers per part
- partscan be ""stock"" or they can be one of 6 different brands, and if 3 parts of the same brand are equipped, there's an extra bonus for the car that varies by brand, and if you have all 6 parts there's an even greater bonus
- parts are completely random, both in what spawns in the shop's inventory and the rewards at the end of a won race 

The bad:
- Cars are locked into one of 5 driving styles and can't be changed. If you want the same car to be able to be a racer, it can't also be a dragster or a runner or a drifter even though the differences between the 3 classes are fairly minimal, or you can't decide to take a car you had for off-roading and change out parts to make it into a street racer. Off-road wasn't a thing in 2015 but does carry over into Heat which does allow you to take any car and change out parts to make it better suited to any other class as desired. 
- Races don't include distance between the next racer ahead of you, behind you, and in first place if that's not you, like I know it is in Heat but can't remember if 2015 was that way. 
-parts are locked to cars, not at all interchangable
- ""cinematic"" cutscenes - can't say much without spoiling anything so I'll leave it at this: 
--there's several missions where you basically have to get your car close enough to a given point and then the cutscene takes over and does a lot of driving for you and then returns controls to you where it's already driving
--when you take out cops pursuing you, if the cop in frame gets wrecked, it goes into slow-mo footage of the car wrecking/flipping and interrupts your driving, so if you're driving on a curving road it can mess with your steering angle and force you to try and correct while you're still trying to evade other cops chasing you. It might not happen too often, but it's definitely caused me to drive into a wall or let the other cops intercept me a few times, forcing me to restart a mission.
- story ends on a cliffhanger. Hope it gets resolved, but given the general reception to the game that I've seen, I'm kinda doubtful

[b]It's really really hard for me to rate an NFS with thumbs down, really.[/b]

But I decided to do it this way and give the game a few more stars because I found it thumbs up and just a star or two more silly.

[b]Personally, I would like to have the option of a neutral rating.[/b]

That would simply be more meaningful for me and since the opinions about the NFS games are totally different for years. 
I can understand the different opinions and sometimes I just don't feel any different. It's not an easy thing with NFS. Unfortunately.
Sure, the games are always kind of good, but sometimes I find the games just as bad, and like many other games, there are people who like it and people who don't.

So good or not so good game? 

[b]The next weak performance with a bit of Fast and the Furious feeling, stuff from other games and microtransactions …[/b]

The campaign with the [b]lame and superficial story[/b] lasts about 15-20 hours. 
The scripted cutscenes give you the feeling that the game is based on the successes of Fast and the Furious. This influence can also be found throughout the game. Fetch helicopters from the sky, support or take over trucks, and so on. [b]But it's not like you do it yourself in any way[/b]. The cutscenes do that as soon as you have reached the target speed or the point next to the truck, for example.

Due to all the ""collective stuff"" such as billboards, drift zones or speed cameras, [b]the game looks more like a game patched together from Burnout Paradise, The Crew or Forza Horizon without a concept of its own[/b]. You can't really complain about the abundance of side missions, but some of them are simply unnecessary and unimportant.

The story is about taking down ""the house"", a cartel and its gangs. Each of these gangs has a special area, so to speak, such as drift, drag, off-road or street racing. [b]What you show in terms of driving skills is not even that relevant. The performance classes that can be bought in the tuning shop with credits or real money are more decisive.[/b] 
This quickly develops into a grind because you are often behind the required performance classes. The whole thing is made even more difficult by the many cars required or the whole game is simply unnecessarily lengthened. 
[b]For every different event you need the right car.[/b] It doesn't matter if your car, e.g. tuned for drifts, has better acceleration or top speed than e.g. your getaway car. You simply cannot use it for escape trips. The relatively good selection of cars doesn't help either.

Btw, Lina Navarro kinda reminds me of Naomi Nagata and that doesn't add up at all...

[b]I don't want to put anyone down on the game, I really don't. But personally I can't really recommend the game.[/b]
It's kind of boring and only marginally fun. [b]It's just along the lines of ""we had to do something and, without any ideas of our own, simply helped ourselves everywhere and then somehow mixed it together into a game"".[/b] 
[u]For me, that makes it one of the worst NFS ever[/u], [b]but that's subjective, as we all know, and everyone sees it differently.[/b]

Personally, [b]I wouldn't pay more than $5 for the game[/b], and I recommend anyone looking to play Payback or any other NFS consider EA Play. There are some NFS titles (and of course other games) included, the costs are manageable and you can easily cancel it.

[hr][/hr]
[b]MY PROS AND CONS:[/b]

✅ good driving characteristics
✅ good vehicle selection
✅ quite a few missions

❌ too much grind
❌ Miserable tuning system (a matter of luck)
❌ weak story
❌ boring races
❌ occasional bugs (collision detection)
❌ Microtransactions

I must say, the driving experience is on point, everything feels right, for Speed/Drifting/Drag racing/etc. And that's coming from a Mouse/KB user.
Did I mention it has a story ? A truck load of challenges ? A diverse variety of races and environment ? Great car visual customisation ? Free driving ? Puzzles for unlocking [spoilers] ? Plenty of cars to satisfy everyone's taste, from the Nissan Skyline to the Lamborghini Huracan, a Beetle perhaps  ?        -  Well, now it it said.

The only downsides I could come up with is:
1. The performance upgrades mechanic, once bought/acquired, they are tied to a single car and modify multiple elements, it's just weird and unnecessary.
2. The multiplayer is pretty dead, and if you come across any people, chances are they will mop the floor with you, go wonder why ? Over-tuned cars ? Upgrades i'm not aware of ? Cheat ? Who knows.

But let's stick to the single player side shall we !

The only thing that doesn't work on the Deck is online community stuff, so for single player you can't see community skins (cloud sync works fine, though, so if you select/apply a community skin on the PC then it'll still work on the Deck). Otherwise, everything works as it should despite it not being an ""officially"" supported on the Deck.

As far as the game itself goes, the story is uninteresting to me. I always skip the dialogue scenes before races. I just like to drive, which is a lot of fun in this game. The cars are fun, the upgrade system could be better (as others have mentioned) but to me the most fun part of upgrades is feeling the difference in the driving. Thankfully, the upgrades are not weak and you can feel noticable increments in performance after visiting the parts shop.

The exploration in this game is also pretty fun. Normally I don't care about all the little extra collectibles, but I think this game has a nice balance of making the collectibles achievable and rewarding as you go. It doesn't require you to focus so hard on them to get them.

I'd say the worst part of the game is that some of the races are annoyingly designed. I'll have a car spec'd way over the recommended spec and I still can't win. This is mostly true for the off road races. It's not very many that this happens, but when it does it's annoying. Also, the cop chases are pretty bland, imo. Most Wanted 2005 still by far holds the crown when it comes to police chases. This game's chases are very linear and you're just trying to follow a path to an escape point while the cops are slamming into you. Pro tip: if you're in the mountains just drive off a cliff. The cops will follow you but the game resets your car and then you're free to continue on your way.

Overall, whether you're a NFS fan or just looking for a fun casual racing game, I think this is an enjoyable choice and I would recommend it on sale.",1650725066,1650725066,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It doesn't deserve a 90% user rating, the tailored campaign missions were fun, for the 15-20 minutes gameplay they provided.

Not to mention the shameless capitalisation of this game: deluxe edition is the only available version and the ads present within the game are annoying, the fact that EA is still selling this game is a large F U to racing fans.

The campaign 'missions' (special events like the gameplay trailer) is what makes this game worth it  *only* on sale at about $15-20 AUD (just less than half price).

When I bought this game, I expected it to be like Heat, but worse. I've seen the reviews, but I didn't look too deep into them because I wanted to form my own opinion and I wanted to see as few spoilers as possible. Therefore I expected every aspect of the game to be worse than in Heat.
Now, obviously Heat is better in so many ways, but honestly, I prefer Payback. Maybe it's because of the novelty, since I played this after Heat, maybe it's because my expectations were way too low. This is quite obviously a subjective rating, but Payback is objectively better in some ways.
Firstly, I would like to address the physics. I prefer Payback's physics,  simply because Heat's physics feels too arcadey to me. Payback still isn't perfect, it's still arcadey af, but I feel like it fits the map pretty well. The cars don't have as much toy car feel. 
Next thing that is definitely missing from Heat are the derelicts. It's such a cool idea and it fits the atmosphere of the game. Collecting the derelict parts felt sort of tedious, but I'm glad it was in the game. The rusty, worn parts look really good on some cars. It allows you to build elaborate sleepers, which is a cool thing to do. 
The soundtrack is another thing that fits the atmosphere of the game. This is the most prominent thing that Payback handled way better than Heat. The grungy rock is a perfect genre for a game set mostly in a desert. The rest of the genres included in the soundtrack were quite enjoyable as well. Heat's soundtrack, on the other hand, feels absolutely soulless.
As I've come to think about it, that's probably the thing that really sets Payback and Heat apart. Payback, even though it's not perfect, has soul. Heat has... Identity crisis I guess?
Now to the customization - I'll start with the trading cards, just so I get that out of the way. It's... an interesting concept? Nah, let's be real, it's awful. Probably the worst thing about Payback. Basing performance upgrades on RNG is utterly idiotic. 
Visual customization, on the other hand, is fantastic. Well, kind of. In the Heat review, I mentioned that I feel like something is missing in terms of customization. I think that might be the autosculpt feature. And also almost all the spoilers/wing look very similar, they're all too racecar-like. But other than that I have to say that the visual customization is fantastic. And the specialized builds are a cool addition as well.
With the car list, it's basically the same as in Heat. It should be enough for the majority of players, I'm just spoiled by Gran Turismo :D
The map is great, I love the vibe. Sometimes it might get a bit restrictive though.
The story is okay for a NFS title. Again, I choose Payback's story over the one in Heat. 
I don't have much else to say, so in conclusion, I surprisingly prefer Payback over Heat.

Interesting idea,execution is absolutely terrible.Dialogue is peak cringe and the ""banter"" is like AI wrote it.Only interesting character is Jess and tbh a game with her as the main character would be interesting.

Gameplay
Racing is the only mode i found fun,drifting is just to beat a target score,no 1v1's no drift trains like ???.Drag is as always botched.Offroad was a good concept but in practice most times your car decides to drive itself,its like having the chopper above you just its invisible.
Car variety is good but locked classes is a stupid idea,the worst part however is the fact you have to grind speed cards or alternatively pray to RNG,a recipe for disaster.
Rubberbanding is prevalent,more so than in Most Wanted (2005) and Carbon which is an accomplishment considering this game came out in 2017.

Soundtrack
Actually decent,unlike previous installments (exceptions being Underground and original Most Wanted) it's actually fitting to listen to.

Map
Rivals,2015 and older installments put together with 2-3 circuits at times it felt like I was playing Rivals especially in the mountains.Only plus is that there is a day/night cycle.

Final thoughts
There is a reason EA bought Codemasters,we might one day see a proper off road/drift implemented.Until then I hope against hope that they will actually bring in the Original Underground 2,MW,Carbon and The Run.

You basically play 3 characters instead of one, in a story that is easy to follow but kind of poorly written. I liked that most of the game you race under sunny skies and clear weather. Crashes were very forgiving, compared to  the previous games, and police chasing was non existent outside of missions, which themselves weren't too tough.
We get the usual cars, with some of the best ones unlocked at the very end. They used a system with cards which is reminiscing of NFSMW, you pick one and upgrade your car after you win a race. I liked it. They had it all in this one in regards to races. You had sprint, drag, drift and a new one called off road which was fun at first but quickly became increasingly difficult to the point where it was really tough and annoying to beat. The rest of the game was easy enough on the medium difficulty, which is another new thing here.

Cars control like the hotwheels game, in which you never use your brakes you just hold the handbrake and turn, making the car magically lose all its speed and you drift around going faster than if you didn't. Your car still maintain all its grip and speed even if you drive on dirt. 

There shortcuts around the tracks that make the traced racing line meaningless, because your opponents will take it and effectivelly make it the  line to take.

It wastes your time with a story nobody asked for in a racing game, making you drive around from point to point for more than 50 minutes before the actual game even starts.

Payback is taking a page out of GTAV's book with you swapping between 3 different characters during the game that all have their own driving skill, so one is good at offroad driving, another is good at normal racing and the third is best at escaping cops.

This does have a lot more racing variety than 2015's game with normal racing, drifting, off roading, drag racing and speed racing, and you can swap between them at anytime if you get bored of one of the storylines.

Things i didn't like are they have this card car upgrade system, where you have to constantly upgrade your car to compete in races using cards you have to buy, now without going into it too deeply it was fine for the most part and i found i didn't have to grind to have enough money for the cards, but it is unneeded and an unnecessary chore in an otherwise fun game.

The graphics are good (not photo realistic, but lets be honest, if you want that, go play Forza or a sim racing game). The story is actually a story and makes sense. The driving mechanics are better than 2015 (not super fidgety and require perfect tuning). There's plenty to do, and the cops don't bother you unless you're in a runner race (one of my biggest pet peeves with NFS was that cops would always chase you when you're just trying to drive around and have fun). It's a open world map (lots of room to drive and have fun (not as big as the Crew, but big enough to take 5 mins to get across the map). It works with an Xbox controller, and if you're tech savvy, will work with PS controllers (I am simply dumbfounded how someone can't figure out how to use a Xbox controller on a Windows computer, in a Need For Speed game).


I give the game a 10/10 and honestly think its one of NFS's best recent games. Obviously not everyone thinks the same, but if you like NFS, give it a try, and don't try basing your experience on previous NFS games. Most games I play, I like, because I don't try to compare it to other games. 99% of the games out there, are their own thing, and should'nt be judged by the previous experiences.

I expected it to be a terrible production mostly focused on the plot, but it is not. What's more, it turned out that the gameplay model borrowed from other arcade games open-world solutions with a car power index indicating the progress in the game. Although there is no atmosphere or the spirit of Need for Speed in it, the whole thing is surprisingly good, and the final effect is spoiled mainly by the forced microtransaction system, tedious gringing, infantile scenario and Polish dubbing. Additionally, the game lacks a multiplayer mode.

Payback is missing the soul of NFS games. 

Driving feels like you are skidding inside a bathtub full of soap.

There is no progression, the game just throws you some cars randomly. After 1 hour I got tired of this BS. I wasn't even bothered by the story, but OMG let me progress like the old NFS games. 

Scenarios are uninspired, everything is sand color even inside the city. Fugly huge blue checkpoints, it doesn't matter if you are in 1st place, if you miss ONE checkpoint you f* the entire race. 

Police car feels Cyberpunk cheap. They just run as fast as the light speed: you are turboing, your screen is shaking and blurry, and the cop car is just humping on you like a horny 13 year old kid.

I have 100%ed the game twice on Ps4 and PC. Should be enough to help with my credibility.
[b]Car Physics[/b]
[list]
    [*]This game has the best 'Brake to Drift' handling style of all NFS games. I can feel weight of the car fighting back while drifting but the steering is really responsive. It's like NFS2015 with lesser random swerving (Good).
    [*]In comparison, drifting does not fell as heavy as Rivals and Hot Pursuit. Very similar to MW2012, but Payback is better in terms of adjustability.
    [*]This game doesn't have a detailed handling settings like 2015, but it has introduced live tuning instead. Basically you can adjust your car's behavior to your driving style mid driving and IMO it is broad enough for every type of player's driving style and not too much to break the game, but I'd still prefer 2015's since its more detailed and based on real life. This is a great introduction to Payback's live tuning. [url=https://steamcommunity.com:/linkfilter/?url=https://www.reddit.com/r/needforspeed/comments/8t92oj/guide_for_live_tuningtuning_vehicles/]Reddit[/url]
    [*]Nitrous system is unique. Not saying its good or bad. Feels like I'm in F&F movie.
    [*]Offroading feels like driving on a bumpy tarmac and the car tends to drift more. Some people hate it, but I like it even more than Heat.
[/list]
[b]Gameplay & Story[/b]
[list]
    [*]There are 5 car classes. Street, off-road, drag, drift, and runner.
    [*]The first 4 classes are straight forward. For runner class cars, they are reinforced sports cars made for getaway.
    [*]Street and off-road races are mediocre. There are some good tracks but not that remarkable.
    [*]Drag race is ok. Really hard to win if you don't know the trick. Here is a memorable moment: There is a track where I had to race the non-steering drag car around a block. It was surprising and frustrating at the same time.
    [*]Drift trails is the best part of this game. Driving on mountain pass has the same feeling as doing touge on an American-sized roads. The physics of drift cars class made it really easy to oversteer by just steering left/right.
    [*]Runner getaway missions are fun, but the bad thing is there is no real pursuit in this game. If you get close enough to the destination the cops/guards will automatically stop chasing you. Chauffeur missions are boring. I spent more time planning my route than driving in those missions.
    [*]Heists/Team Getaway missions are really good. If you see an orange icon showing up on the map, prepare for the fun.
    [*]There are derelics(barnfinds) to be collected. You have to jump from land to higher grounds that cannot be reached from lower ground. Fun & unique.
    [*]AI Racers car designs are lit. Art team did a really great job.
    [*]The story is decent at most. There are so much conversation going on throughout the story making this game the NFS that has the most dialogues
FYI: This is the first NFS that we can hear protagonists talking to each other and themselves.
[/list]
[b]The cons[/b]
[list]
    [*]No Alldrive in this game(Online story mode that was introduced in Rivals).
    [*]No rain(bruh). At least this game has a proper day/night cycle unlike 2015.
    [*]The map didn't specify which part of the road is tarmac or dirt, it's just gray lines placed on a map. So it is a little bit of a guessing game of the terrain you are driving to.
    [*]There clearly is a massive airport runway on the map(bottom right), but it's unreachable. Probably because the devs didn't have enough time to finish the game. Such a shame for EA.
    [*]There are a lot of void in the map protected by barriers made of vibranium. If you try to jump down the cliff or jump over the barrier, the game will either respawn you at the top or your car will hit the invisible wall head-on. It's really annoying when driving in freeroam because some parts you can actually drive straight through the mountains, but forced to drive around instead.
    [*]Cars cannot be transferred to other class one it have been bought. You can't even have the same car for 5 different classes because it might be only available for street class(90% of Hypercars).
    [*]There are a lot of cars that could make it as a hero car as the legendary M3 such as [spoiler]the silver Mustang in the Regera heist mission[/spoiler]. The car was introduced once and never again in the story. It just perished after the mission. This is a waste of potential.
[/list]
[b]The disgrace[/b]
[list]
    [*]Vanity items like air suspension, nitrous & tire smoke colors can only be earned by opening loot boxes disguised as ""Shipments."" Classic EA move.
    [*]The Crew-like car upgrade system. Every time you complete an event, you will get one speed cards. They can have up to 3 perks and vary from 6 parts and 5 brands. It is basically the Crew and the Crew 2 upgrade system mixed together with a little more gimmick(Yes, the Crew upgrade system sucks. If you like this loot box rewarding system then you haven't have your hands on enough good games. Things like this should never be introduced in any type of games. My opinion on this will never change). Another way to earn those cards is to spin the slot(parts) machine and pray that you get the good ones. I tried spinning the wheel for 300+ times in a hacked client and still cannot even max out a single car. Just check this out its all you need to know.

They try to keep the missions diverse and of course they are full of cheese and over the top action, but it's what you expect from a game in the series. I don't even mind the mechanic where you can't directly upgrade your car but you have to play kind of like a casino game for random upgrades. Even though you lack the option it keeps things interesting and makes you want to do more races for more random upgrades. The redeeming quality is that it's not too grindy, the game showers you in tokens and package drops.

The cars handle great, the graphics are good minus the offensive pop-in - even on the highest settings. It can be a bit distracting. In general, I am not a big fan of open-worlds in racing games, because they add a lot of busywork like driving from A to B to get events started. It’s well solved here with lots of easy to unlock fast travel points. Sometimes you still have to drive a few kilometres before you can start the event, but it’s not as bad as in something like - let’s say Forza Horizon. 

The main events in the campaign are divided into five different types of races: Race, Drag (Quarter-Mile Races), Runner (mostly police chase missions), Drift and Off-Road. There was another very fun mode added through DLC - which is included in this edition of the game. Stunt races, where you have to get the highest score possible by doing all kinds of jumps, drifts, speeding and destruction on special courses. Most of these events are fun with a good difficulty curve. As usual the rubber band AI can be a bit frustrating at times. Definitively frustrating are some Runner missions where you have to reach several targets in a certain time frame in any order. These often end in trial and error because there are only one or two effective routes. I also wasn’t a fan of the Drag Races because those just felt like you had to tune your car enough to outclass the other driver by pure horsepower.

Besides the main events, there is your typical open-world blunder like collectables, hidden car parts that can be assembled to whole cars and tons of challenges like speed traps, drift events, jumps and so on. The Autolog is also back to always remind you how good/bad you compare to your friend list. So, lots of content for completionists.

With the main races, you need to unlock cars for every class. You can buy the same car for two different types, but you can’t just buy it once and use it at different events. It’s always separated which can be a bit confusing in the beginning. It doesn’t get better with the upgrade system the game provides. Cars can be upgraded with up to six racing cards. Yes, cards. Because every game nowadays needs freakin’ collectable cards! And of course, you get those cards through what? Hm? Yes! Loot Boxes! And yes, you can buy those for real money. But wait! It seriously isn’t a problem at all. At least the Deluxe Edition - which is the only version you can buy on Steam - comes with more than enough resources so that you hardly have to grind for better gear to get your cars in line with the other drivers. And while confusing and probably unnecessarily complicated, the upgrade system can provide some fun if you are into min-/maxing your stuff.

The presentation of the story is effortful for a racing game. There are lots of cutscenes with dialogue and story and even during the races the three main protagonists hardly shut up. Of course, all of this is on the level of your average Fast & Furious movie and while it isn’t complete cringe, it can be annoying. That money would have been better spent in just more actual “game” because most players will probably just skip those cutscenes. If you like some stupid action-racing movie type of story then it’s at least serviceable - I guess.",1642435968,1642435968,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The customization is great among the cars, lots of vanity items and stancing, and customization options. The storyline is so-so, it's can get pretty boring sometimes but can also be the exact opposite other times. Among the storyline, there are some very good custscenes. I have noticed a problem with some of the cutscenes dropping to 30 fps for unknown reasons. The mechanics of this game are good and fairly easy to learn, drifting actually feels fun and is easy to learn. Game feels awkward and stiff at first however. One MAJOR complaint I have about this game are the cops or enemy vehicles in general. Cops in this game are EXTREMELY overpowered, not to the point where it's impossible to beat the mission but they can make the game quite unenjoyable.
Pros: 
 - Lots of customization options
 - 3 different characters to play as, makes the game more fun
 - Good cutscenes
 - Drifting is very fun in this game

Cons: 
- Laggy cutscenes at time
- Crashing system in this game is horrible (if you care about that stuff)
- Cops make the game unenjoyable a lot.
- The cutscene when you take down an enemy can mess you up while racing heavily.

Driving between races, makes the next race less enticing.  Also, the story doesn't carry it, making it more likely the game will get turned off after a few races, than any excitement in looking forward to the next race.

this is a typical NFS game except for 2 things. the upgrade cards and cop chases. the cards are really not that big of a deal. just spend in game currency ( i never had to grind for money) and use your shipments for part cards. easy. cop chases.. ppl complain about having to start over after being busted.. be a better driver. I stomped this games story mode on hard difficulty using starter cars. GNX for race. Focus RS for offroad. 350z for drift. charger for drag. the only restarts were my errors. easy and fun game. 20 hours is what it took. with messing around too. now to get achievements and such..

First of all - steering. Now the cars are predictable and fun to drive, regardles of perfomance level. The feeling varies highly between classes (I mean, drift car handles different than a street racing, runner machines feel realy heavy).
Of course the driving, physics, grip level are all veery arcade, but thats the point of NFS, right? To feel on the virtual road like a reincarnation of Colin McRae fused with Aerton Senna.
The overall mood of the game is something like a mix of NFS Carbon (story wise) & NFS ProStreet (form of races and setting) with some Holywood-F&F-style stunt flare.
A very nice lineup of cars divided into several categories. Some cars are availible for more then one discipline (i.ex. '69 Charger can be Race, Drag, Runner), while some are eglible for ony one discipline (i.ex Merc G-Class is only for OffRoad).
The visual tuning is almost identical to that from previous instalment - pretty good with lot's of real-life brands of body kits, rims etc.
I will criticise the part of mechanical tuning - it's LAME! Let me explain - after every race You recive a ""Speed Card"". They can also be bouth at tune shops, drawn at a sort of slot machine that gives random cards in exchange for in-game tokens or recived after escaping the pursuit with ""Bait Crates"" randomly found in the world.
The idea behind tuning a car with those cards is beonde me. A card car upgrade one of six elements of car: block, head, exaust, ecu, turbo, gearbox. In the same time a card can have 0 to 3 additinal ""perks"" to upgrade NoS capacity, jump abilites, top speed, brake response, acceleration. It looks totally odd when a card that upgrades engine's head also upgrades breaking performance. So generally the most important factor is car level raging from 0 to 399. If you equip your car with 6 cards of level 18 your machine will be 399lvl, and loosing will become dificult ;)
Another thing to blame are cop chases. They are all scripted, start and end at predefined moments, and take place on a predefined route with minimal freedom. You can't loose the tail on your own. They will just give up about 700 m before finish line. There is also no penalty, nor prize for wrecking patrol cars. I really miss Sgt. Cross... At least the Rhino's ramming You head-on are back.
But overall i car recomend this title if You like racing games, but You'r not a hardcore sim-racer. The story is good for, no offence, 8 YO kids, but gules this somehow toghether, cars drive well, there is lot's of them, visually is OK, better then the previous, without this softing blur effect, lot's of activities beside the mian storyline (jumps, drift zone's, speed traps, collectibles).",1637791945,1637791945,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I really enjoyed the story, the world (good graphics), the cars (and their customization) and you can drive a... semi-truck!!

The driving physics is arcade-ish, but you shouldn't expect sim level driving physics from NFS games.

You will have a cool 20 hours (at least) of good racing events.

Good:
-Racing and pursuits, the reason you play a NFS game, are very fun
-Driving feels familiar and intuitive
-Different classes of races keep gameplay fresh and allow customizing more cars to use
-Opt in challenges provide decent difficulty in not super annoying ways
-Catalog of cars isn't super deep, but provides most iconic cars
-Community design sharing was a very cool feature. Anyone can upload their paint and decal design for other players to see and use on their own cars. 

Meh:
-Open world challenges and collectibles are nice ways to engage while driving to different events, but are not rewarding enough to seek out
-Derelict cars (built from parts found in the open world) are a decent concept, but not worth the time
-Card system of upgrading cars was annoying at first, but is super easy to manipulate once you get used to it
-Soundtrack was passable, but felt super repetitive since only a few songs stand out
-No real reason to upgrade to higher tier cars. You can take any car up to Max, which is great for people that want to main a low-grade car, but I wanted a reason to want the exotic cars besides fulfilling a ""racing fantasy""

Bad:
-I have never played a game that made me cringe as much as this game's writing.
-No reason to ever do side races. Main quests and opt in challenges gave me enough resources to buy whatever I wanted.
-Story missions were the worst part of this game
-Too much RNG with upgrade cards
-Stats do not matter on your car's level, only the tier of upgrade card, forcing me to use cards with worse stats to increase my car's level and unlock higher tier cards.
-Visual customization of cars is very lacking
-Visual customization areas (bumpers, rims, spoilers, etc) are locked behind open world challenges. Even after completing the game I could not fully customize cars.
-Control for certain events were frustrating, mostly the off road events and when they forced you to use your drag racing cars for street races.
-Some stats felt inconsequential. Brakes and Jump felt completely pointless in all activities.",1635713536,1635713536,False,12,1,0.618342995643615723,0,True,False,False

I'm talking about the 2015 NFS and that game beats payback in every way. And it is hard to say anything good about a game when it is not as good as the previous one. The driving is poor and especially drifting it is hard to get the car sideways and when you use the handbrake you loose speed incredibly fast. As usual the story is bad (like all other need for speed games) so that is nothing new. There is a quite big amount of cars to choose from which is nice. so if you want to play a need for speed game choose the 2015 Need For Speed and if you finished that I guess you can give this a try.

- If you got busted, then you have to restart the long mission from the beginning aka no major checkpoints.

NFS Payback trailer looks promising but I personally  didn't like the game ( Will explain it below) 

If you are looking for a Racing Game and you donot own any NFS game then this is a steel deal but the graphics and quality that forza is offering NFS need to step up . NFS Payback is indeed Mediocre 

So what this game does right and what it doesn't goes as following:-

PROS

- Beautiful Visuals with attention to detail like rain drops appearing on car when it rains. Every car looks amazing!
- In depth customization, body, paints, wraps, under-light neon, tons of body parts hoods, side skirts, rims, sound-system, nitrous colors, smoke colors, even horns etc.
- Great open world map with tons of events across, off-road, sprint, drift, time trials.
- 100's of cars to buy and many to unlock through completing achievements and gathering all collectibles.
- AI is pretty good and challenging.
- Cops are pretty great too.
- Great night and day system. In day you earn cash by doing events and at night you get reputation which helps in unlocking more performance parts.
- Performance was pretty great for my PC which is 7-8 years old by now.
- The car feels great and controls good too.
- Eargasmic engine sounds and you can even customize them. Engine swaps alter the sound too.

CONS

- Half baked online multiplayer system where you can't easily match-make with other players. You need to invite your real life friends or get lucky with some random person who is willing to race with you. Crew system is not fleshed out either.

- Music track is kinda boring and leans heavily on pop genre more than rock or metal music like in past entries. (my own personal taste)

- Story is pretty mediocre and story-related missions are very few.",1632844620,1632851639,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Payback on the other hand proved me wrong and made sure I had a damn good time during the 60 hours that I spent in it. There's a cringeworthy story here but it somehow makes you wanna see it through to the end, and it gives you purpose to upgrade your cars and manage your team throughout different racing disciplines. The opposition gradually becomes stronger and it's up to us to keep up with them.

Performance upgrades aside, the visual ways one can boost their ride are plenty. From bumpers to neons, there's quite a selection of things you can customize, and there really were times when Payback reminded me of the Underground era. It's also got that amazing livery editor where you can use all kinda pictures and shapes to basically paint paintings on your ride. Really loved it.

The handling is very arcadey but it felt much more down-to-earth than, say, NFSMW:2012, especially at lower levels with slower cars. The cars are no longer rockets, they won't automatically start pre-scripted drifting whenever you make a turn, and with a wheel and a sequential shifter the driving actually feels really nice and intuitive. Of course, it's less so when you reach McLarens, Lambos and Koenigseggs, but even they feel good to drive.

[b]PROS:[/b]

- This isn't a simulator, and you don't have to be a hardcore racing game player. The focus is on fun, not realism. There are plenty of options for people who want sim racing, but this is for more for people who enjoy car culture, the thrill of the race and the cars themselves.

- Drifting is a hell of a lot of fun in this game

- Each car is acquired for a specific type of race/event, and you can acquire ""doubles"" (or triples, if you want) and kit them out differently for different tasks. For example, you can use the Porsche 911 to drift, race or as a runner, which is essentially a combination of getaway driver, high-stakes delivery and police outrunner.

- Each of the characters has their own specialty, and the characters and voice acting are vastly superior to NFS Heat, along with the story. (Although, like all these games, the story isn't what you're here for and it isn't great. It does, however, hold everything together and give it purpose.) David Ajala (Star Trek Discovery, Nightflyers, Kill Command) is the best of the bunch as Mac, while Jessica Madsen is amusing as the foul-mouthed, irritable getaway driver Jessica Miller.

- Derelicts are classic cars that you assemble from pieces you find out in the game world, starting with the chassis. Each derelict consists of 5 parts. Once you collect them, you can upgrade them like any other car, then take them a step further with ""super builds"" offering visuals you can't get on other vehicles. They're also some of the best cars in the game. The Nissan Fairlady 240ZG '71, for example, is an absolute beast when it's drift-tuned, allowing you to pull off drifts that are near impossible in other cars, while the Mustang 1965 is a very good race car and a spectacular off-road option.

- The visual customization options are deep and allow for serious creativity. This system worked so well, it was brought back exactly as-is for Heat. As an added bonus, you can grab paint/wrap schemes made by other players in the ""Community"" tab. They're displayed by popularity, giving you easy access to the best of the best. You can also get ideas and figure out how other players achieved certain looks and designs by downloading their wraps and taking a closer look.

- The game isn't overly punishing when it comes to visual damage. You can disable visual damage if you'd like, but unlike Heat, cars don't automatically accumulate wear if you don't hit anything, and you won't see damage from small collisions or bumps.


[b]CONS:[/b]

- The soundtrack is terrible. I don't know why the developers feel bound to use only current music, because the atmosphere and visuals would lend themselves to songs from all eras. Like the Heat soundtrack, it's jarring at times. Where Heat could have benefited from synthwave, 80s, retro-80s, metal, Latin and rock (reflecting the real Miami and its pop culture image), Payback could do a lot better than trap and mumble rap, especially when your character is tearing up the desert at night or cruising down the highway in sun-drenches Las Vegas.

- Like every NFS game, and virtually every driving game, the cars are gated. Whereas in Heat and some other games you're required to reach certain rep, in Payback the cars are unlocked via mission completion, chapter by chapter. The downside is that it may take you quite a while, even until late game, to get the car you really want most, and the choices in the early going are generally not great.

- The rubber banding everyone keeps talking about isn't bad in offroad, and is a nonfactor in drift and drag for obvious reasons, but in race it's obvious and very annoying. 

- Likewise, certain styles are more difficult than others. Offroad felt a lot easier to me than race. Drag was ridiculously easy. Drift takes some getting used to, but once you've found the groove and rhythm, it's awesome. And runner ranges from incredibly easy to somewhat difficult, with the timed delivery missions on the harder end of the spectrum.

- The upgrade system is based on random cars rather than buying from a choice of specific parts. That puts you at the mercy of RNG in every way: The card drops from races are random, the cards sold in tune-up shops are random, and just in case you haven't had enough RNG, you can ""roll"" for cards using a special currency, with no control over the ""brand"" you get or the attributes of the card. For example, one card may have an upgrade to Jump ability, while another may upgrade Acceleration, Speed and Nitrous.

-Game has some series issues with progression, it has been made grindy on purpose. If you want to change car you have to start over the grinding for parts, discusting.

Pros:
+Campaign.
+Cars.
+Optional side quests like: drifting, speeding test, speed camera.
+Searching wrecked cars after beating bosses.
+RX-7 and Nissan are fastests cars in this game.
+Pursuit doesn't look so bad when i noticed really brutal & aggressive cops behavior.
+Leveling up in this game is so easy.
+Searching tokens is just another minigame to farm some money and XP points.

Cons:
-Optimization is really terrible, just like at Mafia III.
-Performance is not so good, because even on lowest graphics settings this game works pretty bad and here's a reason why. Because the game has DRM protection called itself: DENUVO The PC Killer.
-Disturbing reflections of lights on the car when you play on lowest graphic settings, it can kill your eyes.
-Disappearing textures after playing 3-4 hours.
-Trading cards loot tuning upgrades system is really terrible, you have to spent about 2.5k trade cards or more to ace your car with same 3 card tiers.
-AI could be a bit more aggressive even on hard difficulty.
-No CO-OP mode.

Conclusion: 2/10. This game had a chance to be really good game, but EA didn't listened and decided to disappoint me.

The Story is quite good, i found it interesting! The Way You Upgrade Your Car is through 'Cards' or basically a slot machine. WHY? Its kind of annoying when you cant just buy the upgrades you want. (you can from a tune up shop but its still on luck.)

Pros - graphics are good, voice acting is good, has a decent story, collectables are cool, the derelict assemble cars gameplay mechanic is really cool (you find parts and u build a car out of them), there are different types of races the best are normal ones, drags and drifting ones, soundtrack and SFX are really good, the game has a  welcome photo mode, huge free roam map with cool locations, the main character isn't that bad, there are also cops and crashing them is fun, car Visual costumization is mostly good. 

Cons - handling is kinda stiff not gonna lie and it feels like it fights you, writing is silly and laughable at times, bugs and glitches, there are car classes and it isn't fun (sounds good but it's terrible, you end up having to buy way to much sh*t), races are tied to the story some are fun and few in numbers and others are NOT and you are forced to do them (ruins the experience), car costumization isn't bad but lacks a little bit still, the way we unlock Visual costumization parts is annoying, the 2 side characters are kinda cringe and annoying some times, THERE IS NO RESET BUTTON and the auto reset is f*cking dog Sh*t, gps some times fails to point the way, bets before the races suck (both the money we get as well as the money we lose and what we have to do), there are 5 race types off road racing (feels like you are on ICE at all times) and runner events (time trials or lazy version of the toolboth events from NFS MW 2005) are lame as f*ck, performance upgrades are done through CARDS actual f*cking CARDS and there is fixed time before you can buy more (10 mins per shipment), there is also a slot machine for them (wtf EA Games, you f*cked up hard here), vanity items (items like horns, tire smoke or nitrous colour) are trash and can be bought through shipments AKA LOOTBOXES, game performance issues (Cpu usage Problems).

Pro:
- Graphic is good, with old rigs.  Radeon RX480 you can run this game more than 60fps with Ultra 1080p setting.
- The gameplay still feel like NFS
- Real brand car, yeah they buy licensed for that super car and hypercar.

Cons:
- Steering wheel support is unplayable. I'm using Logitech G29 and it feel sucks. The steering feel like driving a truck with out powersteering, the feedback force also sucks, the drving direction is unrealistic. this game design for using Xbox controller or PS controller, NEVER BUY Steering wheel for ONLY this game.
- The story is bad, for me the story have so many plot hole. It's better they make the game without the story. yeah but the name Payback is part of the story.
- Speed in this game is not realistic, 120kmph and feels like very slow. Come on, why don't you make realistic speed.
- The police is not realistic, they can hit you with standard police car when you are speeding with Koenigsegg at 300 more kmph. WHAT!

Yet here I am, just finished the game and I'm not gonna lie. I enjoy this game so much, it's so much fun! sure the plot is shallow af, but at least it's there and the characters are a bit interesting.

There's lot's of bugs you can find, even a noob like can notice it but it's not really breaking the game.

If there is one thing I hate about this game, it's the vehicle upgrade mechanism. Whose bright idea is it to implements vehicle upgrading into a slot machine and card game? Just because the theme is gambling doesn't mean you need that stupid card to upgrade. Just stop, go back to regular upgrade mechanism and stay there.

Overall, it's a fun game for your weekend.  Don't expect too much, just hit that nitro button and go crazy.

I wasn't expecting much, but this game is a ton of fun! I haven't had this much fun with an NFS game since Most Wanted 2005. That game is still my top NFS game but this one is up there with it. But the best part? No need to worry about microtransactions at all!!!! They're in there, but there's absolutely no reason to pay extra money for ""speed points"" for upgrades, and this is an EA game!!!! Holy shit I know!!!!

The racing is fun, the graphics look gorgeous, and it runs great, (after disabling vsync in game and using Nvidia vysnc plus a 60fps frame limiter). There's 3 difficulty settings and you can change it at any time. I started on medium but switched to easy a few hours in to ease the rubber banding. Tons of things to do, and the trademark NFS story cheesiness is in full force as usual...which is something I always look forward to in this series. 

The main character, Tyler,(he does races) has the personality of a bagel. He's the most generic, uninteresting white guy they could find. Mac (he does off-road) is silly and doesn't seem to take things too seriously, probably my favorite. Jessica (she does runner missions from the cops, reminded me a lot of The Wheelman game) were the most exciting to me. She has an annoying, monotone voice, but after a while it grew on me and now it's kinda hot at the same time so I don't know what's happening there. And the main villian reminds me of a llama so there's that.

The speed cards are fine as they upgrade performance. Cool, no problem. You earn them through events and can buy them with in game currency. You'll also get item and cash packs (called shipments) as you play too which is cool. One problem I do have (well at first) was cosmetics. In order to unlock them you need to do certain tasks in the world, (destroy 3 billboards to unlock the ability to purchase rims with in game currency for example). So this kinda made me not want to even bother with the cosmetics portion of the game. However, at the same time, the more you play you're most likely going to be doing some of these things anyway and probably without even knowing it, so it's best to not worry about it until a few hours into your game. There's also a really cool feature called derrilct in that there's special car parts scattered throughout the world and if you find all 5 for each vehicle (I think there's 4 or 5 total) you get to build it and get it souped up. Drive around, get the notification on your mini map it's close by and go get it. My favorite was the speedcross(?) tournament missions as these are arenas where you get to drift, go fast, destroy stuff and do huge jumps. There were only 20 of those events but I had a blast doing them all. 

There's also fast travel points (gas stations) which are very welcome. Drive around close to one and it adds it to your map. Same thing with billboards and other collectibles and side activities. World map is great and has filters so you can narrow down to what you're looking for easily. You can set a pin and route it to your mini map, same thing with any activity, although I usually just fast traveled as close as possible.

These games have always had not great soundtracks in my opinion and this game is no different. You can't create your own playlist and remove tracks you don't like. You either get hip hop or ""rock"", but it's more like hipster alternative music. So the volume slider on music got turned down to about 30% just so there's something else going on besides engine noises and the bagel talking the while time.

A lot of people hate the soundtrack in this game, however in my opinion, it's pretty all right. I'm not saying it's better than the OG ""I'm Rock"" or more OG ""Black Betty"", but there are a few decent tracks in this game. Also the sound design is not bad, however there are times, when engine sounds for certain cars sounds exactly same or some moaning or shouting sounds ridiculous, but still it's all right.

About the story, it's not the most deepest thing ever, there are few black holes in it, where the plot either not makes any sense or just the characters do something stupid, but still better than the 2015 NFS's story by a mile. There are a few smaller twist, but in general it's pretty simple. Characters are not deep at all, some of them pretty annoying, because of their ""cool"" lines, but at the end, I was all right with them. Probably my favorite characters from the game is the Curator and Marcus Weir. If you want to play a NFS game because of it's story, except a really simple and most of the time weak story from this game, but for a NFS, it's okay.

Graphics in this game is okay. There are lot of graphical bugs, either textures don't want to load in at all, bushes goes into the air or the camera goes through the level, it's all in the game, but these are not that common. I was okay with it throughout the game.

The controls of this game is... not the most pleasant thing in the universe. You can control your car decently, but my biggest issue was with the turning and drifting. The game has the break-drift mechanic from 2015 NFS game, which I wasn't the biggest fan of, but here drifting is essential for taking some corners, however at the beginning, it was a pain to get use to and I had a really hard time to even race properly. Also, every damn car is under steering in this game, it's impossible to take corners without drifting or owning a decent car. However, I around mid game, I started to get use to it and it was okay, however it's a really weird to control these cars in this game, comparing to other racing games. 

Now, let's talk about the gameplay. In general, it's working and somewhat fun. You can play through the Campaign, doing story missions, challenges, beating roaming racers, finding collectables, getting into chases, buy and tune your cars, these are all working. You can also play multiplayer, where you can use your cars from the story mode, racing with others in different playlists, which is all right and you can get lot of reward for it too. However, the devil is in the details. First thing which gave me literal cancer and you probably know it too, is the tuning. If you want to get better parts in your car, it's not about having lot of money, unlocking the better parts, no... it's RNG based. At the end of the races, you can choose cards, which are the car parts for that specific car, which you used in that race. The car part has a level, brand and additional bonuses for certain attributes, like nitro, speed, acceleration or... air... which makes your car jump higher and lose less speed when reaching ground. You can also get parts with a slot machine game, where you need to use 3 car parts in order to get one POSSIBLY all right... and of course, you can buy higher level, but no attribute cards for money. But wait... what happens if you don't have enough money for upgrading and you don't have a decent car for the races? Well, you can replay races and doing side bets, which are challenges for the race for extra money, which is pretty good. You can grind this no problem, even you can sell your car parts, if don't want it... ooorrrr you can open loot boxes for more money and car parts tickets or even getting extra custom parts for your car... and don't think these loot boxes are for free... you can get them free, but you can only buy them for real money. I don't know who was that genius, who thought this is a good idea, but this is probably the most re****** thing I ever saw in a game. Also, I don't get it why the player needs 5 different car for 5 different event type... and what is even more weirder, different event types cars has different handling, even if we are talking about the same car, but in a different class. There is one race type which I didn't get it, this was Rallycross. The race type is similar to Gymkhana, however in Payback, this race type is complete optional, and there is no reason to play it after completing the quest line. The game not even using it properly, and there is only 2 cars for this race type to use and tuning it... what's the point having it? About the gameplay, I need to mention the difficulty. I played through the game on Hard, which was a great idea, because the game wasn't easy at all to beat, but not frustratingly difficulty or rubberband heavy... but there is Chapter 5, where the game and the story missions start to get ridiculously difficult. AI has way better car than you and upgrading is still a pain, thanks to the RNG slot machine and card system, you can't acquire good enough cars at the beginning of the chapter. My only chance was to complete courier storyline and unlock better cars at the end, but it was pretty difficult. When you get decent cars in this Chapter, the game will be much easier at that point, but this difficulty spike got me real good. Last thing which I didn't liked in the game, is the cop chases. There are even problem with the basics, because destroying cop cars are not easy sometimes, because there is no pursuit breaker to help you, only ramming the police which has inconsistent damage system. But this would be not that big of a deal, but the police rubberbanding hard... and even this wouldn't be a thing, but all of the pursuits are script heavy and it's only mission based. Literally, in free roam I never encountered a police or house car. Most useless thing in the game.

I can say that as far as NFS game goes Payback is ok. The storyline is very basic leaning more towards bland and boring at times, characters aren't really relatable  or standout in any way but at least this time around for once our character has a name and a face so that's good I guess. As far as mechanics go the game is very smooth truthfully, the upgrade system via tune-shop cards is really simple and easy to get a grip on early on so that you don't really have to pay crazy attention to detail later to how you're tuning your cars. Graphics are good nothing to drool about but certainly they're not subpar, the car collection is very generous and assorted which is also great. The 3 racing classes that you have access to them being Offroad, Runner or Racer spice up the game enough to give you extra playtime if you are a completionist or really want to squeeze the most out of the game before being done for good. Overall the game to me is a solid 6/10 : entertaining enough to kill time and scratch that racing itch but nothing that will keep you hooked for any extended period of time, nothing is innovative enough for you to want to bother exploring or taking time to find out more about any given feature so in the end if you can purchase this game and it'll be your money's worth 100% as long as you get it heavily discounted.

TL;DR: game is ok, huge open world, racing mechanics are good and huge car collection. If you're looking for a lot of replayability and a decent storyline you're not getting that here. Overall get it on a massive sale then it'll be worth it.",1626841852,1626841852,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I love the story. It has to be one of the best in the entire need for speed franchise and my favorite. It has twists and turns and a very good villan. I also like how much fun this game is to grind. The tokens and billboards and even just the speed cameras are fun to 3 star. Getting all your cars to 399 and unlocking all the customization options feels very rewarding. 

On the other hand, the handling and physics of the game are ok. I hate how you can crash into a telephone pole going 200 mph in a ford raptor and bounce off. That is probably the most frusturating thing in the game. The fact that you have to have 2 seprate cars for different races are a little bit annoying. I don't want to have to buy 2 McLaren P1s. The shipments suck. The in game purchases are horrible. 

In conclusion, if you are looking for a more layed back need for speed game with a nice story to get sucked into, this is the one.

First one up was Need for Speed Payback and I gotta say, the first impressions were very poor. Yet, I did get through the entire game, having played most of the events, so there is something good to it as well. Not much, but it’s not an entirely unfun experience.

Need for Speed Payback is a rather bizarre desire to combine elements from The Run and Most Wanted, but also add in distinctly different classes of cars for different types of events. As such, it has a (terrible) story with (boring) characters that explains every racing event that happens, though at least it lacks QTEs. On top of it, it focuses way too much on the open world, and by that I mean busywork and pointless driving to where the actual race is. And every racing event belongs to a certain class that requires a separate car, so you can’t off-road in a car made for drifting, or do races in a car made for drag racing. Oh and because it’s EA from 2017, almost every aspect of the game is designed for microtransactions and loot boxes, to the point that the setting of the game is a city full of casinos and gambling.

The plot is sadly unavoidable, but at least it has a few decent characters in it. And to be fair, while I still don’t understand the desire to put any storyline in an NFS game, this might be one of the better ones in the series. And luckily, unlike The Run, most of the really heavily scripted sequences happen during situations, where you’re not meant to believe like you’re actually racing instead of going through a scripted sequence. The real events are real and don’t force the “cinematic moments” in just for the sake of it.

The world in the game is, frankly, boring. And despite the technologically advanced visuals, there’s nothing exciting about how the game looks. It doesn’t help that all of the open world busywork is there literally to be busywork and aren’t even remotely fun to do. Apart from a rather curious concept of treasure hunting for unlocking several special cars. You can’t just start a race, you must ride to where it begins and stop. And the amount of fast travel points in the game is far more limited than you might want. So a lot of the time will be spent just driving to where you need to be to play the game.

Not that the game itself is that exciting. Frankly, I was seriously considering dropping it altogether after a few hours, and it wasn’t until I decided to play a separate event sequence about Speedcross on a whim that I got more invested in the game. That whole event bundle is, shockingly, a DLC for the game (available as part of the Deluxe edition), despite being the highlight of the entire game and being far superior to what you get during the mainline. Races range from being boring to being somewhat okay. Off-road races are usually mediocre and sometimes frustrating. Drifting is great and works rather well with the handling in this game. Drag races are some of the worst races I’ve experienced in any racing game. While the special Runner missions sound exciting at first, being focused on escapes and battles against police cars, but in reality turn out to be either boring or just plain frustrating.

Possibly, the biggest thing I could say about the way racing feels in this one, especially after Hot Pursuit Remastered, is that it’s plain, boring and uneventful. Crashing the car still exists, but it’s hard to tell why – you can bump a wall, back up, start riding as if nothing happened and then have a car reset, because apparently that was a crash. There’s no sense of speed or spectacle. Rubber banding doesn’t exist in a conventional sense, as everything seems to be tied directly to, essentially, “level scaling” which in itself is tied to the microtransaction fueled system. So if you are overpowered, you just ride seconds if not minutes in front of everyone else until the finish line. And if you’re underpowered, you might not even have a chance to win (in Drag races it’s literally impossible to win underpowered, no matter how good you are). And handling is just… weird. No class of car feels right, the way drifting is handled is unconventional and sometimes your inputs seem to be just dropped entirely as the car might refuse to turn when you attempt to.

So yes, the gambling stuff. Basically, you have several kinds of “currency”, as in any microtransaction fueled game, and upgrading your car’s performance is tied to special “cards”. Those cards drop randomly, just like your typical lootboxes, after each event. And can be purchased at tune shops. All of them have random attributes and are always just slightly above in level than what you already have. All of the cards are tied just to the car you’re driving and cannot be used by other cars. Oh and also if you don’t see a card in the store that you want, you can try a literal slot machine to win one, that takes another kind of currency. All of these kinds of fake money can be bought with real money, of course. And this entire design sucks and makes the game completely uninteresting. Because, as I said, you must keep up with these upgrades to actually win, but if you spec your car too high (and why wouldn’t you), then no opponent can keep up with you.

Up until the very end, which was super uneventful and uninteresting, I expected this game to have something. Like the surprising fun discovery of Speedcross events. But no. The most fun and well designed events are a few and the game mostly consists of really tedious races and escapes and cutscenes and boredom. There are cool things to be found in Need for Speed Payback, but it’s simply not worth the time and effort it takes to get the best out of this title.",1625784456,1625784456,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Overall, it's okay. It's not a game with life-changing story. For a NFS story, it's pretty good. Considering most NFS games don't have great stories. It's better than The Last of Us 2, you get my point. The upgrading system with speed cards is awful. You gotta look at the perks, numbers and brands of cards to make your car faster. Controls and physics are drifty and they're okay once you master them. Also you gotta buy different car builds for each type of race, if you have Deluxe Edition, it won't be much of an issue tho.

In conclusion: if you want an arcade racing game for a change, it's alright. Wait for a discount tho, At least myself, I wouldn't pay full price for a 4 year old NFS game",1625722098,1625722098,True,0,0,0.473933637142181396,0,True,False,False

--What is it?--
A really good looking racer. Beautiful cars, a long drawn out story to keep things moving along, and a open world consisting of a city and backwoods areas with plenty of races and race types to choose from. There are key points in the plot that gives very much a feeling of driving in a action movie. For most of the time it's a relatively casual driving game, and that's pretty fun all around. You need to upgrade your cars to be competitive as the races progress, and you can pretty much determine your own difficulty setting by how your car compares to the recommended level car that you need to bring to a race.

There are a lot of cars that you can unlock to buy, and a variety of places to drive. There's also motor car parts that you can buy, to upgrade your vehicles as well as customise your ride in different ways to add a personal touch. You can change the colour, add art to it, or even change the bodywork of segments of the cars.

Now the NFS games have main stories, a big map to roam, a protagonist and crew and a city. It's okay but seems Payback forget an important element: FUN CIRCUITS.

It is not fun when drive mostly on a wild straight road. 
Also, the background seems monotonous, the circuits are too simple, opponents are weak, challenges are too repetitive. Uninteresting plot, uninteresting police chase, non stop dialogue. Why even bother add a Volkswagen Golf to the dealer I am playing NFS not Test Driver.

Totally my bad. In my rush to put up a review, i overlooked a crucial feature; graphics quality.
There 6 main options; auto, low, med, high, ultra and custom. Custom is where you can do the tweaking. All the options you could possibly want is there.

[b]Main review here - prior to the above correction[/b]

Recommended spec is RX-480 4GB, i have RX-580 8GB, yet it still lags horribly; fps sometimes drop below 30 and this is at 720p with the lowest graphics settings. Very disappointing, it kinda kills my enthusiasm to play this; feels more like a chore than fun.

Even when fps reads 60 in the cutscenes or gameplay, it appears more like 30. At times it even appears like 25, very choppy, yet shows 60 fps. Even someone with an RTX couldn't impress me; i can still see stuttering and lag. Should've taken that as a red-flag. Instead, i was curious because my card handled F1 2020 very well at settings other than lowest.

Graphics options are minimal, so there's not much you can tweak. There's;
[olist]
[*]resolution of course, 
[*]fullscreen or windowed
[*]v-sync on or off
[*]blur on or off
[/olist]

[b]AND,[/b] get this, the most underwhelming option of all: graphics quality; auto, low, medium or high. WUT?? Nothing to see here, move on. So there, all you can eat buffet for tweakers; not much to choose from.

I bought this primarily for the cinematic cutscenes, not for the cars nor world nor upgrades nor customizations, although, those are nicely done. The cutscenes is a whole lot better than earlier NFS titles; they are epic IMO.

So here's the breakdown scores:
[list]
[*]Cutscenes - 8
[*]Story - 7
[*]Graphics - 8
[*]Music - 7 
[*]Sound Effects - 8
[*]Voice acting - 8
[*]Driving mechanics - 6
[*]Slow Motion Car Kill cams - 7 (framing and FOV a bit disappointing at times)
[*]Performance is erratic - 5 (stuttering and lags) I think you need faster RAM and SSD storage. 
[/list]

Overall score - [b]7.1/10[/b]
Reluctantly a yes recommendation because maybe with faster RAM clocking and SSD you might get better results. I might migrate this installation to the NVMe SSD drive and overclock the RAM a bit to see if the performance improves.

Oh BTW, i disabled 4 cores and SMT to see if there are any improvements because the system requirements specifically states 4 threads. Unsure if there is any but maybe there is 1 or 2 fps improvements.",1622401528,1622444272,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
The second instalment EA trying back to their NFS root.
street racing cars. lots of JDM, no Toyotas though.
there's beauty cars like Mclaren P1, Aston Martin Vulcan, Pagani Huehueheya BC
almost all cars can be modified.
endless vinyl customization.
NEON!! NOS colour!!, getting only at lootboxes though.

Cons:
must complete objective in order to unlock customization. BAD!
Card like upgrade, must matching the card and get the card via gacha/lootbox very grindy to get 'perfect' upgrade.
3 different driver with different racing disciple with their own respective cars of course. it's mean we can't finish all event with single car.
too 'open world' you can go anywhere but the map mostly dessert. the city area are las vegas kind of city. the daylight cycle feels random can't decide i want to go at night or in the morning to do sunmori.
the story kinda fast and furious mind blowingly stupid.
no cop at free roam but there's cop only at event and magically dissapear if we reach the finish line what ever it takes.

Having come off that, how does Need for Speed: Payback fare?

For those who want the short version - do I recommend it? Keeping in mind the horrible requirement of Origin & possibly bad optimization of the game, despite that I had a very enjoyable time with the game. So if you want a fun racing game you can spend, give or take, 10-ish hours as a first playthrough beating, I'd say go for it.

For those who want something a little extra - read on!

[h1]Story:[/h1]
NFS Payback's story isn't anywhere near as bad as some have made it out to be. Granted I don't think the pacing or writing of it was good but that doesn't mean I think it was bad. Rather I'd say it's underdeveloped instead. You go from being pals with Lina Navarro at the start to suddenly having her be your mortal enemy all within 20 minutes of the game and that just felt weird. They didn't give us enough time to invest into her character and give us a motive for hating her, it just felt like ""lina do bad, you must go hate lina and take her down now"" and that's about it.

I also think the main antagonists - The House - were left way too ambiguous. Not in a good way - they just didn't feel super significant in the grand scheme of things which is odd. Instead, what I end up remembering more about the story of Payback is probably the main trio you play as - Tyler, Mac and Jess - and the crews you take down along the way. But The House? I couldn't give two hoots about them as I played through and even after finishing them off in the last race I'm left wondering ""who were they anyway?""

Where the game picks up the slack though I think is in the minor interactions & references. There were moments throughout the story where I had a giggle at some of the references to past games. I won't spoil them if you haven't seen them already yet but Payback likes to make callbacks to older NFS games and I thought that was a nice touch, even going on to answer some things about the older games. And the interactions your characters have with some of the crews you end up taking down are also entertaining, some just being smug, others feeling like the characters have a broken marriage among them where they hate each other one race and the next one they're all buddy-buddy reminiscing about their past. I found that really endearing.

[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]
Coming off of 2015's poorly-received driving model, Payback had a lot of shoes to fill. I'm very happy to report that the driving model is vastly improved over its predecessor's, making you feel like you have full control over your car...for the most part. Brake-to-drift is, once again, one of the main ways to get your car around corners, meaning it's still got that bootleg Burnout feeling to it. Admittedly it stopped bothering me after the first chapter of the game though I'm still not a huge fan of the way Need for Speed's been for the last 11+ years and sadly Payback is here to continue that trend. Despite that - the game feels great to play. Cars are fast, responsive and, baring in mind a few exceptions, I felt like I was actually in total control over my car. Getting from place to place, unlike in 2015, didn't feel like a chore and I greatly appreciate the improvements.

The one problem I have with the driving model in Payback is one of its core new introductions - off-roading. Off-roading honestly sometimes feels like the game has gone back to 2015 with cars being slippery and unresponsive. I get that it's the whole point - it's intended to be a challenge, but more often than not driving off-road meant it was time to wrestle with the game instead of actually playing it. The off-road races are going to be the closest thing to the ""Tandem Drift"" event from 2015 if you ever found that fun.

Improved driving model aside, there is one thing about the gameplay that I genuinely disliked and was a very common complaint throughout my playthrough - the progression system. Why oh WHY did they make the progression system based on GAMBLING?! I get it - it fits thematically with the game's lore. But is it fun to play? Hell no. GAMBLING for car upgrades is STUPID. Not being able to buy the parts you want for your build is STUPID. Having the upgrade shop be based on a timer is STUPID. The way you progress in this game is just STUPID. It is easily the worst part about the game and sours the experience for me. Sure you can earn Speed Cards by winning events, but if your car is underpowered for a specific part of the game and you wanna make it better - that's when you have to engage with this game's gambling & loot box system and it's DUMB. I genuinely hate it.

One minor comment I'm not sure whether I like or not is the lack of free roam cops. One the one hand - it makes traversing the open world to get to your next destination a lot smoother since you don't have to worry about getting randomly chased out of nowhere and the game has more than enough free roam activities to keep you busy & wandering around otherwise. On the other hand - for how involved the police is in the game's story it feels incredibly weird to leave them out of being able to chase you in free roam? Gotta take the good with the bad on this one I suppose. Personally despite how weird it is to not have them in free roam I didn't really mind all that much. The game filled in the cops' shoes well enough by giving you a huge variety of activities to partake in anyway.

[h1]Graphics, Sound & Optimization[/h1]
Despite playing the game entirely on low settings, I think NFS Payback looks great. It's visually distinct, vivid and disregarding the desert setting the game generally looks colorful, lively and full of detail. Cars get realistically dirty & damaged the more you drive & beat them and provides you with plenty of customization options for stuff like tire smoke & nitrous.

The music I can't comment on despite having finished the game as I had the entire soundtrack disabled throughout my entire playthrough and listened to other songs while playing instead. The sound is a different story. First of all - the voice acting. Despite Jess sounding like she's bored 24/7 and Mac getting insanely annoying with how much he just can't shut up about himself, I think the voice acting in this game is pretty good. Characters under their roles sound convincing and there were definitely some moments that had me give the game a chuckle or two.

Optimization wise...well, to preface this - I streamed my entire playthrough of the game on Twitch. And let's just say that my PC isn't the most powerful thing on the planet. So I frequently encountered plenty of stutters, plenty of framedrops and even a few times when the game just unloaded & reloaded everything directly in front of my eyes. Sometimes just not loading ANYTHING at all, causing me to fall through the map! However I'm willing to chalk all that up to just the game struggling to juggle resources on my PC rather than the game itself being very poorly optimized. For the curious - my PC is an i5-4460 with a GTX 1650 and 16GB of RAM.

Also this game REQUIRES Origin. Take that as a warning - [b][u]you will be forced to download and make an Origin account just to play this game.[/u][/b] For some - this might as well be a dealbreaker.

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]
Do I recommend NFS Payback? If you want a 10+ hour racing game with callbacks to previous games and a fun handling model, I'd say go for it. At $30 you get your money's worth. If you disliked 2015 like a lot of people did, Payback will make you appreciate the amount of improvements made to basically everything.

However if you don't like engaging with gambling to progress, I'd advise to stay away.",1621716230,1621716230,True,34,0,0.752875566482543945,2,True,False,False

First Off The Good

The Cars Handle Amazingly The Feel Of Speed Really Puts Your Need For Speed Into Full Respect 
The Landscape And Setting Is Amazing
Lots Of Fun Little Things To Do Around The Setting Like Speed Traps Drift Challenges And More! 
Lots Of Real Life Cars From The Old To The New From The Hyper To The Classics And Modern Day Street Legal Cars That You Can Customise To Your Heart Explodes.
Cars Sound AWSOME!!!
The Police Chases Are The Most Fun I Had Since Most Wanted Classic (Not New One) 

The Somewhat Bad But Could Be Good Depending On Player

I Felt At Times Races Would be easy at one Point And The Be Insane Hard I Remember Having To Do A Few Of The Races Near The End Of The Game Cause The A.I That's Ahead Is Like Gone Oh Yeah He Gone! LoL :D  Like A Challenge But It Seemed At Times The A.I Where Way Beyond The Medium Setting I Played The Game On! 

Storey Is A Meh! But Truly Racing Based Games Don't Do Well With Storey Not Very Much Do Its More For The Cars The Races The Cops Chases Etc.

Some Minor Bugs Like There Was A Point In Game Where My Character Was Out Of The Car With Half Her Body In The Car And Half On The Roof It Was Funny To See But A Quick Restart Fixed It :D

A bit over the top and like you're in an action movie, but hey, that's fine in an arcade racer. There are 2 things that make me want to give up on this game for good every time I play it. The first being the upgrade system using CARDS instead of just being able to buy upgrades like every other game that has worked so well for years. To be honest, I could even get over the cards, even though I think it is one of the worst things NFS has ever tried. The one thing that makes me want to claw my eyes out with a spoon is the OFF-ROAD RACING. HOW DID THIS MAKE IT PAST TESTING?! Seriously, you'd be better off racing them with your eyes closed because no matter what you do on the controller the vehicle is going to do whatever it wants off-road.

Overall the cars feels good, drifting is real fun oh and i think this is the first nfs with rally, which is also fun. The map is pretty diverse and fun to explore. The photomode is nice too

The story is okay, i expect nothing less, i just wish there is more cutscene and story driven mission.

Now the hate part, first rally handling need more tweaking, rally is fun until the car decide to slides on dirt and oversteer like crazy even on supposedly awd car. Then some BS mission than force you to drive outside car class comfort zone (this one maybe because i suck)

Then the whole progression system, Payback using card system stolen from The Crew (well many thing stolen from The Crew) so if you play The Crew you already familiar. With this system no matter how crap your car, you can level it up until you can beat exotics easily. 

The problem when you want to buy another car, even for same class, you need to get the card again by random. Luckily steam version has some money boost, so you dont really have to grind as long as you stick to one car for each class.

Oh yeah, for the car customization part, its good enough for me. Except some part customization is locked until specific condition fulfiled which is terrible. Also tyre customization is so ugly, is just brand logo painted to the tire wall, 

If you dont mind sticking one car each class for the whole game, or grind the heck out of it. i still recommend it when on sale, its still fun game overall",1615912451,1615912451,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

HOWEVER I am changing my review relative to the newer NFS titles, namely Hot Pursuit remastered and NFS 2015. Relative to those, this game is AMAZING. 
Let's be honest, the only reason you're thinking about getting this game in 2021+ is because your PC is too much of a potato (like mine) to run the latest NFS game. 

This game has a huuuge (mostly empty but still) map to explore if you enjoy doing that, and many many different events to beat, as well as challenges to complete. The car customization is a bit lacking in terms of part availability. I also don't know why the devs decided not to include roaming cops? They're literally the most fun part of the NFS series, you can sink hours into the game just by messing around with police. Well not in this game.

Payback looks great, performance could be better but it's not a deal breaker, the car models are very nice looking, the city is a breath of fresh air as not many games have ever really used fake Las Vegas as it's basis. The world is very nicely done and rather interesting but there are so many shortcuts taken during development, in my 5+ hours I found so many unfinished areas with literal gaps in the ground and objects. Constantly hitting invisible objects or gliding through rocks with no hit boxes.

Pro's:
+Responsive controls. A lot of Ghost/Criterion's other games like Most Wanted and Hot Pursuit were absolutely PLAGUED by awful responsiveness that was programmed in as ""steering delay"" a fix was created for Most Wanted by a community member but Hot Pursuit was left untouched and to me is borderline unplayable because of this.
+Everything looks really good aside from the character models.
+Selection of cars.
+Customization is pretty in-depth, you have nearly as much control creativity wise as the later Forza games.
+Tuning, that's a good thing but it's hampered by the card system.

Cons:
-The handling model doesn't feel all that great, played with my Xbox One S pad and with my Logitech G29, wheel support is an absolute joke, there are literally NO wheel options at all, on my G29 which is one of the few supported wheels for this game my steering didn't work properly at all. out of 900 degrees of turning radius the car would maybe turn 200 of that, no clutch option, no H shifter option, just nothing. Controller felt the best unsuprisingly, car drifts just by turning too much leading to too much oversteer constantly or the car won't turn hardly at all and will lead to massive understeer, this makes it very annoying to drive depending on the vehicle.
-Feeling of speed is horrible, probably one of the worst I've seen. 150MPH feels like 60MPH. Vehicles take forever to get up to speed unless fully modded. My modified '06 Subaru OBXT in real life can do 0-60 in about 3-4 seconds on average and with no heat soak at sea level I can pull 3's all day, an Audi S5 in this game takes about 5 seconds to get up to 60MPH and then it's painfully slow after that point as well. I feel like the crippling slow upgrades and the weak feeling of speed were designed to get people to drop money on this game.
-Rubber banding is atrocious and extremely easy to spot. There's also some weird hoodoo with police and enemy vehicles when they're chasing you. Multiple times when a cop has gotten close to me, without touching, my steering goes bonkers and the game starts auto steering me
-Little to no damage model.
-Tuning is stupidly limited to the card system they put in place so you're limited to only what upgrades you randomly unlock or purchase as they become available after every so minutes randomly.
-Story is weak. Characters are all extremely forgettable, models for them look awful as well. I could feel the need for tokenism pandering almost immediately. Literally every single character is awful, there is NOTHING redeeming about any of them.

I went back to The Crew 1 after this and had MUCH more fun with full proper wheel support. You can tell they were trying to make Payback as a Horizon clone but it falls short in every single aspect. I just wanna race, make money, upgrade my car, race, progress the story, make money, unlock shit and race and upgrade some more and buy and upgrade more cars along the way. Payback hinders you in almost every single way and the little activities you come across aren't even very fun. The Crew did a much better job with being able to restart immediately and even a mostly base vehicle could at least get the job done, maybe not a gold but a bronze at least. In Payback, there's some speed traps where the base vehicles or even modified can't even reach that speed yet or during the Speed Runs there are so many fucking pedestrian cars and blind turns you can't do them properly period or if you bump one of the pedestrian vehicles as a base model vehicle you'll slow down to such a point you won't make up the difference. I don't think I've ever played a game that HINDERS a vehicle's performance in the game compared to it's real life counter part. They're usually either on-par or way faster.

Just play The Crew or play Forza Horizon 4. Way way way more worth your time than this game.",1615080038,1615080038,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Collecting achievements (it was harder from the beginning) forced me to master this game in all aspects and, thanks to these challenges, to increase my racing skills.
I really enjoyed improving cars, and after each new piece, I was basically looking forward to what I would make of it.

I also found some disadvantages, the main one is an incredibly disgusting and ugly black woman who is supposed to be the main antagonist.
I must also mention that I almost broke the keyboard while fulfilling drift challenges when sunday drivers and trucks from Poland were constantly emerging in the curve.. really diabolical.. thank you EA.

Payback tries to evoke a sense of gaming Fast and Furious and calmly, the story could also compete with the film series.

Pros:
[list]
[*] Great graphics and it holds frames well.
[*] Once you figure out the vehicle handling it becomes pretty easy to control and drift around.
[*] There's a fair amount to do in single-player if you want to complete everything. Probably 50-60 hours if you go for all activities and collectables.
[*] In the arcade spirit, tuning and upgrades are pretty simple to grasp.
[*] Vehicles sound pretty good and seem to be based on their actual engine notes, at least in some cases.
[/list]

Cons:
[list]
[*] Dead multi-player.
[*] You expect a NFS story-mode to be cringe, but the story and acting is truly awful
[*] Kind of a weird and somewhat unscrupulous vehicle upgrade system that allows you to buy upgrade cards/points if you want to. It's not necessary and you can go along just fine without it, but it's just a bit sad that it's even a thing as some people may fall for it. You can acquire and fully upgrade any vehicles you want just by playing the game, but if you wanted to buy and upgrade every single vehicle, you'll either spend hundreds of hours to grind in-game currency or end up paying for these upgrades packs.
[*] It's very obvious this is a straight up console game that got a bare-bones PC port. No ability to customize gamepad controls, no manual save system, etc.

But damn the controls for this game are absolutely solid, id say its better than NFS heat. I had so much fun just driving about the city doing drifts and stuff like the controls are very responsive, if you crash its one of two reasons someone smashed into you or your own fault. 

The story flows pretty well, its abit cliche but the missions are insane, there are 3 main characters part of your crew, and in the main story missions you get to play as all 3 which is pretty cool and how it flows from character to character in these missions is so smooth that it actually enhances your experience by alot. The action in these missions are paced very well also.

You have main event types - race/Speedcross/drag/drift/offroad/runner with each event being assigned to a single character, these mini storylines tie in with the main story giving behind details of whats happening. 

The characters you come across are voiced pretty well, all having their own quirks and personality which adds to them enjoyment of the game.

Now heres the main reason why i love this game. Your car customization is absolutely amazing, being able to literally change any part of your car and add cool effects, like you can make your exhaust smoke red which made me drift more than i should just to see that sexy smoke arghhhhh.

I think this game is underappreciated, more people should definitely play it. As the reviews for this game are actually pretty good, but not many have tried it.

Moreover, these cards are stuck on the vehicle that earns them, meaning that when you buy a new car you must start this process over. The selection is a bit small for vehicles , made more noticeable as you see some familiar grills pop up in different car categories. The best cars don't even unlock until the plot is over, or a matter of few hours from over. A decent amount of things to do in the game, but again, it's held back by the mechanics surrounding cars. In regards to the plot, it's a standard revenge tale that could have used more turns, especially since the last cutscene hinted at a character being put into a position where they may have been a greater overarching villain pulling the strings, but then the credits just roll before the major ramifications of your revenge are even really considered. I understand it's a car game and doesn't need to be War and Peace, but it wouldn't hurt for the plot to be interesting or fulfilling, especially as two of the main characters get sidelined in the finale. Finally, there is the major performance issue of stuttering  when the game is launched, lasting approximately 10-20 minutes, which is just unacceptable as it makes the game unplayable for that duration. For reference, I was using a 2070, not that I think using a better card will help as it has been identified as an optimization issue. Rather than buy this, buy NFS Heat for an arcade racer more in line with this style as it lacks most of these issues outside of a significantly weaker plot. Alternatively, you could play Absolute Drift, an excellent arcadier title that is more of high score drift focused title. NFS Hot Pursuit is great, Most Wanted is also fine. I'd rate this game about 5/10, as the experience with the vehicles themselves feel as fluent and snappy as other, and outside of an interesting, albeit wasted,  premise, really carry this game.",1613722916,1613722916,False,13,2,0.649278640747070313,0,True,False,False

Thumb up ONLY for the 8/10 gameplay, 9/10 customisation and well done car details. 

Rest of the game is a total mess, grind, greedy politic and annoying mechanics.

I have listed some disadvantages, just to warn you about problems with this game. (random order)
1. It is immpossible to lose different than by time. Your car is indestructible, just a few scratches and thats all.
2. ****ing Polish dubbing. My ears were bleeding, deffinetely too much cringe dialogs and stupid taunts.
3. There weren't police except escape missions, where policeman ramms you or waits for frontal collision or uses super high technology allowing him to turn off your car ... only for a 5 seconds and after that you can still run away.
4. In my opinion soundtrack is great but gets bored really quick, so i turned it off in half of the game.
5. Location of some tokens/chips, where you have to perform a perfect fly to collect it. 
6. After each race car upgrade is needed or you won't win.
7. Lootboxes, cards and gambling system :))))
8. EA makes me to buy dlc ... that allows me to unlock all tags on the map to see collectibles, gas stations OR i can just goolge it for free.
9. Reputation system which means nothing.
10. No turn off gamepad vibration option, you have to do it manually in game files.
11. Empty ranked queue. Don't waste your time waiting, find fellows on steam discussions or some other forums.
12. Recommended race level is underleveled not knowing why, by 20-30 points.

Pursuits: They are basically just races. You have a timelimit and a set course even though the game plays in an open world. The Police just rubberband after you until you get 600m from the escape point at which point they suddenly magically can't catch up anymore. The predecessor that did this better was the highly praised NFS Most Wanted where you'd use your environment to take out cops and had to actually escape.

Drag Races: They are not bad, but a bit boring. In NFS Underground, you had fixed lanes and fully designed drag races, with which I mean every environmental car was put there for with purpose. In Payback they just let the regular traffic algorithm do its thing and hope it'll ""just work"", but most of the time you barely get any traffic and just go a straight line from start to finish.

Also I didn't quite like the HotWheels optic for the cars of the other contestants. Overall I still had fun though, which is good I guess",1612883376,1612883376,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The vehicle selection varies from the usual cars seen in need for speed games and customisation is expansive, even going so far as offering ""super build"" cosmetic adjustments for derelict cars.

The game offers multiple game types from Street races, off-road, drag, drift, stunt, police chase and more. Each of these gametypes have their own vehicle storefront allowing whilst restricting the player to owning cars for each specific mode.

A MASSIVE problem with Payback is that of its upgrade system. The developers opted to move away from your usual selection of upgrades from manufacturers and chose to implement a car part card upgrade system that locks your desired upgrades behind lots of RNG and time spent spinning the wheel. It feels awful spending most of my time with a new vehicle in a menu spinning a wheel rather than upgrading with earnt money or through races.

The story is better than the latest installment (heat) in that it has a beginning, middle and end.

Sadly, a huge turn off or frustration for some Is the dialogue and delivery from the voice actors, rivaling the cringe that was Need For Speed 2015's narrative. 

You will have to suffer through a campaign of awful one liners just to enjoy the near perfect driving and world that Need for Speed: Payback offers.",1611231075,1612867467,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The main reason for my negative review is due to the neglection of not adding proper controller support for anything besides Xbox One, and thats it (You are forever stuck with Keyboard and Mouse.) and drifting using W+A or W+S and handbreak is one of the most frustrating things to attempt in this game without a controller to adjust your wheels for a cleaner drift experience without spinning out. The other reason why I dont find this game appealing is I originally bought it to enjoy the typical Need For Speed experience of being chased by police, and racing - however with the flashy title and wonderful cover art, the only police chasing you'll ever see is in the campaign since no police officers roam the open world you cause havoc in. This means you can crash and ruin traffic, destroy street signs, and disobey as you please with no threat.

The Pros
good graphics
good story line nothing crazy but you get this feel that they had fun and a good time writing it
alot of different cars to choose from and customize and you can download other peoples custom wraps onto your car
the races are alot of fun and who you race for example ill be driving a grand national going against older japanese imports with classic muscle cars that are well customized 
The cons 
parts of the game feels lazy all destructible items ( like wooden fences) no matter what you drive or how fast if you hit it 1 mph it explodes 
all though you get a good selection of cars to choose from to drive. The traffic in this game is very repative not like gta were you can have the same car spawn and you wont see it for a bit I always find myself passing a dodge caliper every couple streets
always seems to have the same amount of traffic generated whether your downtown or in the middle of a dessert so the city feels pretty barren considering you have nobody walking on sidewalks and a lack of cars dt with no parked cars",1611798854,1611798854,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am just playing it leisurely and have no real purpose/reason to finish the game. I just want to play it with my nephew.

It does feel a bit better than NFS 2015 given that the track is no completely ""locked in"" and the 'world"" is more open. It is a plus and also a downside depending on where I am viewing it from.

I am not a fan of the casino/lootbox mechanic but it is workable at least and a change of ""mechanic"", though quite a leap/departure to how you'd expect upgrading your vehicle to be done in racing games.

If it is on sale, go for it. At regular price, I'd say wait. No point in rushing the purchase since it is not a current game anyway, so you can wait for it to go on sale, which seems to be frequently already.

Oh, and at least the ""story videos"" are not recorded live action actors doing a cheezy skit I guess. So a breath of fresh air coming from NFS 2015.",1611743353,1611743353,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I will also say though I clicked the No on recommending this game, it was a surprisingly tough decision and I will now go into the why. 

I bought this game because I wanted a racing game with a stupid, cheesy story to remind me of the excellent Need For Speed Most Wanted (2005) that you can't buy on steam. With that in mind the story starring Naomi Nagata (Dominique Tipper)  from The Expanse (seriously watch this show) definitely fits the bill, unfolding like a cheesy Fast & Furious knock off where the actors play their characters so straight you have to believe they're being satirical fit exactly what I was after. The rest of the game however.... Read on. 

The open world is nicely put together with varied environments and plenty to do, borrowing heavily from Burnout Paradise and Forza Horizon. Graphics are lovely although it is annoying seeing the internals of your car fully rendered through the rear window but there being no cockpit camera, however this is an arcade racer so I wasn't expecting a cockpit cam going in, 

Race types are varied enough with Drag, Street Race, Drift, Off-Road and the always awesome Police Chases. 
The upgrade system is via cards which is a little derivative and basically resembles loot shooters in that you just replace one numbered card with a higher number to upgrade your vehicle. 

But it's the actual racing that made this a no from me. It has by far the worst handling of any racing game I have ever played. I'm being deadly serious, I own a hell of a lot of racing games both on PC and Console and this is the worst, no question. Driving is incredibly dull with most cars not knowing how to corner unless you enable the over the top drift mode which ends up being just as terrible but in the other direction. For instance don't bother using the standard brake button just use the handbrake instead assuming you want your car to behave remotely like an actual car and not understeer into the wall regardless of if you're driving a Ford Mustang or a Nissan Skyline. I know it's an arcade racer and not a sim but you expect arcade racers to simplify the act of driving a car not feel like you're driving the speedboat in a GTA game. 

So yeah, if like me you're after a racer with a fast and furious/most wanted esque story to kill some time then pick it up on sale otherwise steer clear. Also police chases are always fun!",1611670368,1611670368,False,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

For starters, this game has a serious technical flaw; controller support is very poorly done. I couldn't get my Logitech G27 wheel controller to work at all. Then I tried to use my Logitech F310 - gamepad, that worked somehow but you can't even re-map the buttons on controller, forcing me to stick with pre-made layout. You also can't adjust sensitivity at all, making controlling car very twitchy. There are barely any options to set up your controller. Game seems to support only couple wheels and only xbox gamepads. I've played many other driving games, Grid series, Dirt series, other NFS games, Forza Horizon and Motorsport, Wreckfest and the list goes on... literally all other games get it right and you can get your wheel to work at least decently. Just plain lazyness from the devs and ignoring other people with different controllers.

Driving in this game is very fast paced and full of action with races having jumps, drifting, dodging traffic and trying not to crash into that traffic. Indeed kind of fun. Driving physics are very arcadey, you rarely have to touch the brakes and you can drift even the tightest corners. For drifting events this works but for normal races I'd liked to have a bit more realistic approach. To me cars felt like hoverboards on asphalt, I enjoyed driving straighter roads with more space but driving in tight canyon roads became quickly frustrating. They really nailed arcade-racing back in the days of old NFS Underground, Most Wanted & Carbon era, its bit sad to see where things have evolved. After many hours i got bit used to handling model but it's far from good imo.

On the good side game had lots of variety with races. You got normal Races with completing laps, offroad races, some sprint racing, drifting, drag races, and courier / cop chasing missions. I especially enjoyed Offroading, its a really nice addition and it makes this game stand out from older NFS games. Most of the Career were interesting. You get a nice backstory with characters, acting is bit cheesy but that is more of a NFS trademark than a con. Gambling theme is present in story but also in upgrades and race bets. Making money is quite easy in career if you want to collect cars, that's a huge plus. Also now you will get enough space for all of your cars at garages. Thumbs up for that. Drifting were fun, drag felt quickly boring. Cop chases are really dumbed down. Instead the way where you freely escape the cops you have to drive into escape points what add you some time. It's like sprint racing where you have to stay in one fixed route and cops are chasing you. Police is overly aggressive and cop cars try to constantly push you and go absolutely berserk. And eventually cops just magically get behind and lose you every time. Not very fun and it made cop chases boring and repetetive. Same can be said from car performance upgrading what is another idiotic thing; only way to upgrade car perfomance is the cards. You can buy them from tuning shop, randomly get them from slot machine or as reward from races. You randomly get good or bad card. Whole system is dumbed down and uninspiring. Performance upgrading was never difficult or too clumsy in NFS before so I can't understand what are the real benefits with this?

And now more positive things; Car selection is diverse, I was happy to see a bit more rarer vehicles in PC games such as Volvo 242, Buick GNX, Mustang Foxbody etc. Also it was great fun to try find all old derelict cars from the map. There is plenty of visual customization options and a great livery editor full with decals. These things are where NFS Payback shines.   Graphics are good and visuals are impressive, not the best on the market but all good to my eye. There are plenty of different roads and activities in the open world, hot deserts, tight canyon roads, busy neon-lit city and even mountains filled with forests. I even had to stop my car to see some of those beautiful landscapes :) For the first time in NFS series I felt the open world is really huge and interesting. I liked how car engines sounded and they felt realistic. There is also neat sound echoing on the world when you drive into tunnel or drive close to the walls. 

In summary NFS Payback is a car game with many good bits but also with many flaws. It's a shame how bad controller support is, it really affects the driving. It also has many odd design choices such as uninspiring cop chases, and the performance card-system. It had potential to be a really good game but now it feels its a bit rushed average product. I can't fully recommend it, if it's on sale and you have Xbox or some other gamepad you could go for it.

Pros:
- Good car roster
- Excellent sound (some cards sound really amazing)
- Good amount of potential customization (visual and performance)
- Fun arcade physics
- Open world (with random events)
- Different racing mods
- Off road racing

Cons:
- Bellow average story
- Upgrading with RNG cards is the worst method for the racing game

- you will crash and take wrong turns every once in a while because you cannot spot the correct course in time (can restart/replay all events, though)
- the upgrade system is like a collectible card game for each car in contrast to common unlock-and-purchase- mechanics
- traffic will randomly ruin your attempts in driftzones, speedtraps and the like more often than not

then it is worth checking out!

In fact, there are a lot of things that I enjoy more than in NFS Heat.

- drifting is still not great, but a lot better than the abysmal NFS Heat variant
- you have a crew of 3 characters, each with their own specialties and cars for specific events
- 6 chapters of story with a good amount of races to them that require you play each of the characters
- story is good enough, and your characters actually have dialog and make comments in races
- opposing crews and their bossed try so hard to be mean and badass, it's already funny
- treasure hunting for 5 different wrecks that you can upgrade to very cool, outrageous builds
- a diverse landscape, from high speed desert roads and dusty offroad trails over serpentine mountain roads and villages to a city with bridges and tunnels - it is all there!
- lots of skill activities, collectibles and side duels against cops and street racers that you can do to earn resources but are not required since they don't contain unique rewards - you can earn all the stuff by doing the things you like.

If you like NFS in general and can get this on sale, you can't go wrong. The DLC cars are not that interesting and surely not required, purchse only if you have money to burn.
The map is pure robbery, don't support EA's moneygrubbing tactics. Unless you are an obsessive completionist, it is not necessary to find everything. There is no unique car or other unlock to be had that way.

This game has neither of those. 

Upgrades are random chance. Your choices are either scout out every store on the map for a ""speed card"" that you need, or take your chance literally gambling with the game's premium currency. The cars feel less like something I've tuned and perfected for the setup I want, and more of a build that I was forced into because some of the stats were higher than my previous, even if it doesn't drive the way I like to drive.

The world is terribly designed. The vast majority is a desert with few alternative paths to take, and bland areas to explore. The world feels much more empty than 2015, there aren't many cars driving around and it feels like there's less to do.

I'd pass on this game and just get a different Need For Speed game. If you have played all of them and want more driving, this is still passable. You can just do better.",1609081701,1609081701,False,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

You also need to race against many different leagues, the first time you encounter each league a scene will play with a little background to what they are all about, but honestly, for most of them you'll probably just cringe.

The map is easily my favorite map from any Need for Speed game that I have played. You are in Fortune Valley, the city is full of casinos and gambling, and outside of the city is desert roads, small towns, and even mountain roads surrounded by a more lush landscape. Plenty of off road trails to adventure and plenty of windy roads to drift around. They did a fantastic job on the map for this game.

The car selection isn't super large, but it is decent, I'm sure there will be several vehicles you'll love to see. They have cars, trucks, and SUVs in their list. The driving physics are fun, easy to drift and easy to control. The strangest part about the cars in this game is how the performance upgrading is handled.

i rarely play racing game and buying this game because i want to drift and have some nostalgia from playing older series like underground series and pro street. it have some interesting gameplay features like tuning, speed cards, and car categories.

pros:
- open world
- good graphic
- some cars and visual customizations
- i can drift, drag, race, off road in one single game (also hot pursuit like gameplay don't know what it is called)
- handling is ok in keyboard not sure how good it is in wheel or stick but it can be tuned a bit

cons:
- so far i can only use mouse in view car mode in garage. it is not a bad issue but mouse definitely can be used more than just that.
- the graphic is good but looks like it use more resource

speed card is an interesting feature that makes each of your car have some kind of progression.  it definitely doesn't feel real at all but the progression does feel nice. the bad thing is it works on each of your car, meaning that if you have another car, then you have to grind that other car.

car categories is another interesting feature/take. you can categorize your car into something like drift, drag, etc. the issue here is each category will make your car handle differently, you can't have single car for multiple category, and you can't reassign it i think. this make things feels really weird and very unrealistic. at times i even feel i can drift better in my race car than in my drift car.",1608452386,1608452386,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I see NFS Payback as gamechanger on the series. Even though every single game had a sort of a story behind everything connecting the dots, they were usually boring and quite shallow.
The game story is about a crew of 3 guys who got betrayed during a car-heist job. From there, they'll work hard with their skills to get revenge (or payback) from what happened. The only way to that is by getting into this super race but, all the races are rigged, so skills should do the trick.

I really liked that you see the story through the eyes of 3 different characters with totally different driving skills (and personalities). Even the comments they make are very particular. I just missed more of them talking to each other during the game. Sometimes Jess will ask for a burger or the mechanic will ask you to stop by the garage. We should have more of these things!

Don't expect anything close to real world physics as we see on CARS Project for example. But that doesn't mean the game is stupid, it's just focused on another type of gamer. If you like races for fun and relaxing time in front of a screen you found the game for it!

The soundtrack is pretty decent but it gets repetitive after a while. You can change the tracks and that's a HUGE improvement though.

The scenes are simply breathtaking! EA was able to build up a whole city with diverse environments. From this Nevada-like desert to a classic city, but also taking moutains, dirty roads and even a dam into account! If you get tired of racing other cars, a stroll around the map as something funny to do.


And now the CONS

They've come up with this insane idea of ""what if we make gamers compete on a race with a car that's not for that?"" and that was a huge drawback. There's a moment in which you're driving a drag-racing car, but then you need to free race other cars. Guys, WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT? We spend a lot of time building up cars and then you put us into this messy race-thing? WHY?

Character development is shallow. It was amazing seeing that you follow the whole plot through the eyes of 3 different people. But after a couple of minutes into the gameplay, it seems that changing the driver doesn't change anything at all. There was little information about their background and the game dialogues could be used more often to provide a greater experience.

Off-road races were a blast but dragging was just painful. We all know that drag races go back into NFS story. Some of us are fed up with them, and some still want them around. But whatever the decision was, the drag races here only shows up at the end of the game plot and they're absolutely annoying.

Speedcross series was awesome, BUT WHY ON EARTH CAN'T I USE SPEEDCROSS CARS ON DIFFERENT SORTS OF RACES??? So, they come up with this ingenious idea of making a multi-purpose car that you can use for everything, from dirty roads to drift and speed. But, can you chosse this car to compete on the other races? NO. Why? Just because.

The police was either over-buffed or underpowered. Police cars are faster than you. It doesn't matter how fast or how high your car build is. In this game, the police vehicles are F18s pretending to be cars. They're fast as missile but stupid as a donkey. Some will hit you at ultrasonic speed and have you crashing around, others will just be around hitting walls. Getting away was never easier in a game before.

Plus, a nice selection of vintage cars and modern cars to fit whatever gameplay style you're looking for, not to mention the Car types as well!
The story is okay, i felt attatched to make it thru the end, made me play everyday till i finished it, some might not enjoy it, some might congratulate EA for its horrible voice act (which sometimes i can agree with).

For the first few hours, I was having the time of my life, loving the gameplay, story, everything. And then I hit a wall, does this formula sound familiar? It sounds like a mobile game....oh dear....

The story of Payback plays out just like a Fast and Furious movie which made me enjoy it instantly. You play as Tyler, Jess, and Mac. They are pulling off a job in the beginning of the game, but get betrayed int he end and get disbanded. A few months later, Tyler gets the will and opportunity to get his revenge on the woman who betrayed him and his crew and sets off to get....payback.

The opening mission and all story missions in general are very well crafted. You avoid cops and drive through checkpoints and then a cutscene plays where you switch to another crew mate. I thought this was freaking awesome and it totally drew me in. I loved the dialogue between Tyler and his crew, you feel like they're real close friends even outside of story missions when they occasionally call each other. There are a lot of regular races and events you'll do to progress the story and defeat crews. You can even drive in the open world to smash billboards, find hidden items, etc. Like other reviews, I was disappointed that you couldn't do pursuit chases in the open world, unless you find crate events.

The gameplay is fun but has it's moments (especially in the later half of the game) of frustration. Sometimes your car will be too drifty, and other times you can't get it to drift at all. It's all about your equipment in your car (which we'll discuss in the gripes section). As frustrating as it was, it's also exhilarating when you hit drifts perfectly, or racing at over 120 MPH. The arcadey racing is really good when done right.

The music soundtrack was really good. This took me back to my days playing ol school Burnout, NFS, and Midnight Club games. My only problem was that your playlist was locked to what ""category"" of car you were driving (another thing we'll get into once we arrive to the gripe section). Certain songs I wanted to hear, I couldn't listen to because of the car I was driving in, and that sucked. The game looks beautiful on PC though. Loved the look of the cars and how great the crashing takedowns on police vehicles looked.

*deep breath* Okay, let's get into these gripes, because there are many. For starters, the category system. Each car is broken into different categories: DRIFT, RACE, DRAG, RUNNER,and OFFROAD. You need different cars to do different events and races, etc. On paper this is cool, but the problem is, the game doesn't diversify the cars. The game will tell you that you must have a ""DRIFT"" car for this event, however, the same RACE car you bought from the RACE dealership will also be at DRIFT dealership. And most times, it will drive exactly the same. Sure there may be a different car here and there, but the majority of the cars are exactly the same across all dealerships, what's the point of splitting them up then?
The BIGGEST problem is the lootbox system in this game...wait I'm sorry...Speed Card system in this game. Remember in classic NFS games where you could customize your car and parts in the garage to make them stronger? That's all gone and now replaced with this randomized Speed Card system! You get cards from completing events and from loot crates the game sends you for playing well. At first this isn't a big deal, as long as you drive well you'll do fine. Well....once you reach chapter 2, that all changes. Before you do any event, there's a ""recommended"" level your car should be at. If you're not at the level, 9.5 times out of 10, you don't stand a chance in the race. The AI will dust you, with no chance of catching up. You have to go to the tune-up shop, which has randomized cards every few minutes and just HOPE that it has the cards you need to get your level up. If not, you gotta grind old races to get those cards. And it gets EVEN WORSE when you get to chapter 3 and better. The recommend level gets ridiculously higher within the same mission list. Instead of enjoying the story, you have to stop and just grind and pray that you get the card you need to make your car better to get past the event you're stuck on. Even your cosmetics are locked behind these loot boxes! They really wanted you to pay to pass events. And if you buy a new car, even if it's in the same category, you can't use the speed cards you had on a previously purchased model. I could understand if this was online, but this is the SINGLE PLAYER CAMPAIGN! Needless to say, I got close to the end of the game, and just gave up. I was tired of pointless grinding and RNG just to finish the story, which is a shame because I was actually enjoying it!

Final verdict? *sigh* I wish I had the ability to not give this a thumbs up or down but more like a neutral. This game is fun when you're just playing it for the arcadey racing. But that paywall and loot box system, it makes you feel like you're playing a mobile game and you already paid for a AAA title. If you;re looking for a fun racing game, you can pick this up. Bur beware, once you get to the later half of the game, be prepared for RNG and frustrating grinding. Thanks for reading!

TL:DR: Great arcadey racing game with a Fast and Furious-like story. However, there is low customization and upgrades are replaced with loot boxes. Be prepared to hit a wall when you get to the later half of the game if you decide to play this.",1604862597,1604862597,False,4,0,0.582309544086456299,1,True,False,False

the main single player story campaign is an absolute joke. It starts off decent and feels somewhat reasonable, but then the main villian / antagonist blows up the protagonists house nearly killing him. You then find out the casino is corrupt and that a lot of the factions have beef with the casino. So, you have to make allies. But the other factions are all snobs. You have to prove your better than them just to talk to them. You have to prove yourself by beating the leaders crew mates in races, not once, not twice, but usually 3 or 4 times, just to be able to get the main leader to race you. You have to do this repetitive boring process with like 6 factions, meaning you have to do 30+ pointless races Just to be allowed to unlock the next set of story missions. The worst faction by far is the drag racing faction. The game gives you an old shitty car as default, and it is literally impossible to beat the drag racers, so you have to go to a store and buy a better drag race car. by the way of which all the drag racers act like snobs. Why should our characters even give a shit about drag racing? It’s stupid and it has nothing with the driver and everything to do with the car and some of the game dialogue even acknowledges it at some point. Anyways, you beat all of the factions and every single one of them afterwards is just like “yeah what ever your a good racer, your taking down the casino? Cool story we’re rootin for ya.” Then in one of the later missions you steal cars from the casino, and they rigged BOMBS to the cars to kill you I presume. You find out later that the cars were bait cars and were rigged with explosives from the start. Then later in the story, there is a “party” where all the racer factions get together to hang out, and the main villian shows up in front of everyone just to tell the protagonist something like “you don’t stand a chance” and they bicker like petty siblings and then she leaves. It’s like this game was written by a 6 year old. The villian literally tried to kill you on 2 separate occasions, and even when face to face, your character never says anything like “hey you tried to kill me you piece of s****!” Instead your character just acts like a cocky street racer, just like everyone else. Why oh why would you make a story line this ridiculous? Honestly it’s on the same level as watching a cartoon meant for kindergartners.",1604558304,1604558304,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Ghost Games third entry in the series. At the time, hyped during the E3 reveal for its graphics and story missions. Need For Speed: Payback was welcomed at first as one of the series most lackluster games, and is generally branded as an easy pass when it comes to racing games. Yet here am I, giving a postive review. And trust me, I'm not gonna tell you ""oh no this game is misunderstood, it's actually a masterpiece!"". But allow me to explain some things:

[h1] Cars[/h1]
When it comes to cars, how is Payback's roster? While it certainly isn't as overreaching as Heat's roster, it's actually in a very nice middle ground. Payback is currently the only game in the series which allows you to build a car from derelict parts, and this feature allowed the introduction of some rare, but interesting cars, such as the Chevrolet Bel Air, or the Volkswagen Beetle. Said feature also allowed for an interesting feature - as these cars aren't just for show. You can literally build late game killers from these cars. And while irrealistic, I'll admit it was one of the fun parts (""bye Lambo, eat my '65 Mustang dust""). 

Regarding other cars, the roster is comprised from oldies like Volvo 242, to JDMs such as the Silvia and the RX-7, to a very beautiful selection of hypercars, from the Viper to a wide selection of Lambos and Porsches, and an appearence by the mighty Regera. Beware tho - money doesn't grow in trees in NFS: Payback, so invest your money and time carefully in your rides.

[h1] Gameplay[/h1]
[u] Soundtrack[/u]: soundtracks often come as a winning point in NFS games. Most Wanted and Underground 2 are still games which made certain songs be stuff of legends. Even Hot Pursuit is and was widely aclaimed for its soundtrack. Payback tho... Eh. It's in a weird mixture of trap/hip hop to a certain type of electronic which doesn't sit well with the environment at all. I enjoyed about 50% of the songs, to be gentle.

[u] Race types[/u]: 10 points for Team Payback here. Race types are most fun and varied, and Drag races are incorporated again in the storyline. While pursuit mode is a bit lackluster here, Runner missions are actually some of the most fun I've had, and they're a good mix of ""mission"" and ""pursuit"".

[u] Environment/Aesthetic[/u]: not the prettiest in its class. Heat and 2015 are the definitive experience if you play Need For Speed for the aesthetics. However... that doesn't mean Payback is ugly or anything. Snapshot Pro is actually a nice upgrade from 2015, and I've actually taken some nice pics from the game.

[u] Fortune Valley[/u]: not the best map. At all. Underground 2's map is retirement-old as of this time, and the highways, road mountains and side alleys make up for a better ride than Fortune Valley. The redeeming feature is the off-road part, where offtrack you can actually get a fun experience out of cruising.

[u] Performance parts[/u]: ugh. No. No. Never again. Payback is the ONLY entry so far where performance upgrades are done thru ""Speed Cards"", which you get in a ""surprise mechanic"", EA-type of lootbox kind of thing. Again - there's a reason why this is the ONLY entry where this happens. The community came down on this game over it.

After all this, why is my review positive?

[u] Gameplay[/u]: Story-wise, it's uninspired (I don't wanna spoil it for anyone, but ugh. Seriously. Wanna play NFS for the story? Skip this one). But the way the game feels? Oof. I've drifted with an offroad-prepped '65 Mustang in the middle of the mountains. I took my RSR to unmatchable speeds through the mountains tunnels. I drifted in the middle of the forests with a BMW M4 GTS like I was DK himself. I damaged police cars doing Neville's move in Need For Speed: Carbon with a monster of a Camaro. While the brake-to-drift configuration was appaling to many, Payback will be worthwile to the casual, day-to-day Need For Speed player.",1604440722,1604440935,True,7,0,0.629629611968994141,1,True,False,False

My reviews are based around the Logitech controllers and multiple games that you may use these on.
Please take note this took like 3 days to come up with all the configurations correctly so this will save you heaps of time.  
Okay every one, thanks for taken the time to read this information I am about to help you with.
First and foremost this is a review on two types of steering wheels for Xbox.
I firstly purchased a G923 Logitech steering wheel which if any of you have been reading my feed on my profile it was an epic fail on steam and on Xbox windows recognised the steering controls when binding the controls for how you like to play. Myself I like to customise my controls to each game I’m sure many of you are also the same. 
So moving forward today I took back the G923 and replaced it for a G920 Logitech and similar issues occurred. I checked that is was been noticed in the computer by search bar on windows and looked up set up usb gaming controllers which showed they was actually active and OK. So I know at this point and time my PC wasn’t the issue it’s was something else. I did some further digging on google and came across this awesome video, this is the link VIRTUAL DRIVER YouTube Chanel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34UTccFM9hc 
I strongly suggest you  follow every instructions this guy’s tells you to do as it worked fixing issues with my steering wheel., he deserves a donation in my opinion but I couldn’t find any link to send him a few dollars to thank him for this support because it worked for me thank F**k , anyways I also brought today a Logitech 710 w/l controller and I can confirm this control is in fact full recognised on steam without any issues. 
I just wanted to share this advice with you all, as I know now firsthand how bloody stressful it can be to get the correct controllers and so forth, just wanted to make your time a little easier if you was or are having difficulties with your steering wheel G920 etc.   
I have the 920 now configured for the Xbox windows, next job is of cause steam and fingers crossed I can use the wheel on Steam too, if not the Logitech 710 w/l controller works amazing. 
Happy Gaming

I was a big fan of The Crew and how the roughly 65-mission campaign story integrated into the open world.  The Crew 2 removed virtually all of that, making it feel a bit aimless where you just choose random event after random event.  I need more story context in my driving game.  I recently tried Forza Horizon 4 because I thought it might be like The Crew except in Scotland, but while it does have several mini-stories, they are relatively minimal in terms of story content.  Then the Need For Speed 6-game bundle went on sale so I grabbed that and have been playing through them chronologically.  So I've played every game from Burnout Paradise Remastered up through Payback, and only have Heat yet to install.

I've read lots of reviews and discussions from NFS fans talking about the merits of one game's story over another, but the truth that I discovered is that Most Wanted 2012, Rivals, and NFS 2015 have no story whatsoever.  They are just ""here's a car and a map, go do stuff.""  NFS 2015 has the illusion of a story with the live-action cutscenes and sometimes interesting phone calls you receive from your crew, but it becomes apparent before long that it is mostly just characters telling you ""Hey there's an event over here, come do it.""  I initially had fun with every one of these games, but before long they started to feel directionless and that sapped my interest.

But NFS Payback is something entirely different!  It has an evolving story that frames many of the events so that there's a lot more to draw you into the world other than ""here's a car and a map, go do some stuff"" and gives more color to the various locations.  This is exactly what I've been missing in every racing game I've tried since the original Crew, including the much-vaunted Forza Horizon 4.  I'm having a lot of fun in Payback watching the story progress and learning about the various factions.  There's still plenty of open-world content for you to drive around and do as you see fit, but the addition of the campaign story is the vital ingredient that I think has been missing from the NFS series since at least Most Wanted 2012.

If you're a fan of The Crew (the first one), then Payback is the NFS game that you want to pick up.  The three games previous to Payback will feel a bit hollow and aimless in comparison, even though they have merits in other areas--for instance, NFS 2015's night visuals look amazing even 5 years later.  I can't speak for NFS Heat's story yet but I have the impression it might be dialed back a bit from what Payback did, which would be unfortunate.",1604010786,1604010786,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Having completed it I can say that it feels far from the night time street racing of the NFS games I grew up playing; it's more akin to an arcade racer like The Crew 2 or one of the Forza Horizon games. However, I can say that Payback is not as good as either of the aforementioned titles.
Payback is not a bad game but it is marred by a terrible upgrading system, where winning parts to improve your car is essentially a gamble. When you win a race or complete another event like picking up one of the bait boxes (which leads to a police chase) you can choose one of three cards, containing an upgrade for your car. Of course if you are seeking a particular part, like turbo, and you end up with something else, you'd have to grind the race again until you get it. The gambling of the post-race cards is abated slightly by the shops in the game world, where you can buy cards; but even this is luck-based, as the shop will stock random parts that refresh every so often. Can't find the part you want? Enjoy waiting for a few minutes.
The story is standard Need for Speed affair, cheesy as all hell and not worth paying much attention to. Tyler Morgan and his crew get betrayed by someone and Tyler, fixated with revenge, seeks to get back at them blah blah blah. The story is progressed by finishing events, and there are some ok events here. Drifting is hard to get used to but fun once you get the hang of it. Races are ok although there should have been more of them. The courier missions are boring. The police chases are ok (but nowhere near as good as Most Wanted 2005.) Off-road racing is cool. Drag racing however is dire, not as good as drag racing in the Underground games. There's also Speedcross races, which are the funnest races in the whole game; however they are added as DLC and thus not part of the main story (although they should have been).
The map is good, pretty big but not too big, and diverse with forests, deserts, canyons and the city. The city is confusing to navigate though at first.
Overall if you're thinking of getting an arcade racer, consider The Crew 2 or Forza Horizon instead, both of those are much better than this. Payback had potential to be better but the bad upgrade system, lame story and the grinding (especially when you finish the game) hold it back from being a truly good game. If only EA looked back at the mid-2000s and once again realised how to make a good racing game.",1603906134,1603906134,False,3,0,0.51056593656539917,0,True,False,False

I'll mention the most annoying points, and I'll compare with Forza Horizon 4 as both are open-world and share many aspects.

Also, I haven't played the other titles in the series, so I won't compare with other NFSs 

[h1]Tuning[/h1]

Tuning in this game is simply awful. 

- First of all, you have to progress through the story in order to unlock better upgrades, so if you wanted to play with your friends who already finished the game, well too bad, you have to go through the 20+ hours long story first. Forza Horizon 4 on the other hand lets you purchase any upgrade right away and you can participate in the fastest races from the get go.
[i]Note: This is less of an issue if you don't plan to play multiplayer or at least not right away, but it's still annoying[/i]

- Upgrades are ""cards"", you get random upgrade cards with random perks and a random level as rewards, and while you can also buy them, the shop is also random. [b]There is no way to get the card you want, it's all random and you just have to grind endlessly until you get something that's close enough to what you need[/b]. 
In contrast, in Forza Horizon 4 you can just buy the upgrade you want/need, there is no randomness involved, you don't have to spend 2 hours trying to get the right upgrade.

- I have mixed feelings about this last point: Upgrade cards in this game don't visibly change your car. Visual customization is separate, for example, spoilers are part of the visual customization, so adding one to your car has no effect whatsoever on the performance. In FH4, adding a spoiler would improve handling and decrease speed. 
This means you can make your car look dumb with no performance loss, which is both cool and meh. 

[h1]Police chases[/h1]

Police chases are one of the main things of this game, and as far as I know, of all NFS games. I can only say that they are a bit underwhelming, cops basically have infinite speed and will always catch up to you until you get close to the ""escape point"", once you're about 1km away from the escape point, the cops will just slow down significantly. 

""Oh no, Control, I've turned off my engine and somehow I cannot catch up to the suspect anymore, we lost them.""  - 10/10 immersion

[h1]Drag races[/h1]

This is one of the few things this game mostly does better than FH4, in FH4, drag races are just dumb ""press forward until the finish line"". 

- In this game, drag races enforce manual shifting, and the better your timing for shifting is, the more nitrous you get. This makes drag races actually require you to play the game, and not just ""haha I have the better car I automatically win"". 

- However, they still managed to ruin parts of it, (very minor spoilers) [spoiler]the story will force you to do regular races (as in: not a straight line) and even offroad races with your drag car because the devs went like ""haha wouldn't it be funny if we took this drag car built specifically to go on straight asphalt roads and forced it to on dirt curved roads hahahaha""[/spoiler] 

[h1]Racing[/h1]

- I'm not going to comment much on the racing style, it's extremely arcade, it makes FH4 look like a simulator despite also being arcade. I really dislike this game's racing style, but I'm sure some people on the contrary prefer this over FH4's style.

- As a small rant however, I'd like to note that the invisible walls in this game are cancerous, there's a lot of ramps in this game for jumps, and every time you jump, you have a good chance of hitting some random ass invisible wall that will throw you of course.

[h1]Micro-transactions[/h1]

There's loot-boxes in this game and they're absolutely worthless. You definitely don't need to pay additional bucks to get through the story, the most grindy part are the upgrade cards and the loot-boxes don't really help you with that, the loot boxes only matter for the visual effects they give you (that you can't get anywhere else). They're not that big of a deal and don't really impact gameplay, but the fact they even exist is a downside in my book. 

[h1]End note[/h1]

Pros:
-Quite a list of cars
-Customisation is nice
-The map is ok/good
-Characters are okay, could be better, but are passable
-Quite aggresive cops
-Songs that play depending on where you are and time of day (desert, downtown, mountain, etc. Morning, Afternoon, Night) Which is pretty creative

Neutral:
-The story could be better but it's nothing horrific in my eyes, It didn't gave me much of a sense to, well, Payback, since the start felt rushed, but at the final race I really got that feeling of bringing down The House

Cons:
-Optimiziation problems, it suffers from Watch Dogs 2 Syndrome where it lags even when in low graphics when there is a lot going on on the screen like cop chases and driving around the city, however it's better than Watch Dogs 2, since you don't get much lag on open areas, different from Watch Dogs 2 which is pretty much everywhere
-No free roaming cops, only for some events
-The AI can be a bit too punishing
-Not having the ability to change your handling settings like the 2015 game did, which can be quite annoying
-Airtime is a mechanic. Too much of it? Good luck getting collectibles cuz you will fly past them, or go way too high during a race and land where you didn't want to
-The way you get upgrades... It's basically The Crew 1's way of getting upgrades, you finish a race, you get a CARD that upgrades your engine/ecu/transmisison/whatever, and it's all very RPG-like, which isn't a good thing, you basically have to wait for the performance shop to restock so you can buy better parts, you can't just go there and buy the best ones in case you have the money
-Lootboxes, of course, why not, it's an EA game after all. Everyone wanted neon lights for their cars but they didn't deliver it on the 2015 game, everyone complained about it, so they added it! IN. MOTHER. F-CKING. LOOT BOXES. You basically have to open shipment crates to get a chance to get neon lights, which include colors and patterns in which they flash, along with nitrous colour, tire smoke, and horn sound, which is all cool and games until you realise you need to open lootboxes for them instead of just buying them. And the best part is? You use one of those items in your car, you can't take them off, to your inventory, you either delete them or replace them, you want to take it out and use in another car? Too bad, open more lootboxes so MAYBE you get the same neon/smoke/nitrous/horn. I bought the Deluxe Edition and I got 5 platinum neons, tire smokes, and nitrouses for free, which seemed pretty good until I realized I couldn't use them as much as I wanted because there are only 5 of each, if I use all of them, they're gone, like, forever. Such bullshit
-The deluxe edition doesn't come with the car pack dlc. Sure, I don't care much about those cars but, seriously? The D E L U X E edition doesn't come with all dlc? What a dissapointment

Conclusion:
6/10 - Need for Speed: Payback is a flawed game, it seemed to have potential, but was ruined by corporate greed. The story was okay, but enjoyable I guess. The songs were enjoyable. The car variety was enjoyable. The customization was enjoyable. Taking down The House was enjoyable. There are a couple of things in this game that make me believe that Ghost Games at least tried to deliver something decent, and it's quite unfortunate that EA had to ruin it all with microtransactions. I'm not gonna put all of the blame on EA however, some things in the game are probably Ghost's own fault, but still, the fact that this game has loot boxes, and when everyone wanted neon, they put neon in said loot boxes, shows what kind of company EA is.

If you want to buy the game, wait for a sale, and try it, if you like it, then that's very good, it's not the best game in the world, and I believe it's deserving of a downvote because of EA's incompetence, but it's worth giving a try at least for me, you might get some fun out of it. I'm glad that the next game, Need for Speed Heat, is better than this one in every aspect, It's too expensive for me to buy it since I live in Brazil, a harsh country with a shitty economy, but I hope I get the chance to play it one day. For now, Payback is the most recent need for speed I have, and although it is far from perfect, I cannot lie, it was a fun ride.

I hope this was a good review. The longest one I've ever done.",1603503578,1603548152,False,73,0,0.856388390064239502,18,True,False,False

The offroading is complete garbage. The handling is twitchy, and frusterating. You drift when you want to stop drifting, and when you need to kick the back end out, your car just decides that it doesn't want to turn the front wheels... and then you fall off a cliff or smash into a rocky canyon wall. When you are racing the second and third off road leagues (FEM and HC) the drivers are auful. They will piledrive you into a wall and then be back to 100 mph in about 2 seconds. In both of the second off road leagues, I found myself being 20-30 levels over the recommended level and I still had to turn the difficulty to easy to advance to the next race. (I played through most of the game on medium.) The Rubberbanding is a massive annoyance as well. But the worst thing about this game is the respawn system. It works a bit like the offroading in principle... when you scrape off something lightly and are on your way, it respawns you. but when you go flying off course onto a road and need to get back to the track quickly, good luck. You're on your own. Also, half of the time when it respawns you, it does so about 3 ft in front of a wall with you doing 20-30 mph, which causes you to crash and costing you more time than if you had not been respawned at all. 

with the somewhat angry rant over with...
 I would actually recommend this game. despite the 2 massive issues I have mentioned above, the overall expirence is a good one. The derilect cars for one, was a great addition to the game. The story, while admittedly being a bit on the cheesy side was fun to play through, and kept the game moving along at a nice pace. The customization is really good, and it is just fun to do some absurd car builds. The map is fantastic, with forests, a big city, deserts, canyons, an airfield, and many really nice driving roads. The car class system (Race, Drift, Drag, Offroad, and Runner) inspired me to build some interesting cars, like my Drag speced corvette and my Drift mustang. honestly, I didn't find the loot boxes or whatever they are called to be to annoying, because you can get them from level ups, stars, and you get 10 premium shipments from getting the Deluxe Edition (which is the only one you can get on steam). The upgrade system was all right. on the one hand, It was super cool when you got that perfect part for your car that made all the difference in The way it drove. On the other hand, it was immensely frusterating when you just need one particular part and the game won't give you one. That being said, it does fit with the games whole theme of gambling, so if nothing else, it fits the asthetic that the devs were going for. 

This game is definatly worth a buy. if it's on sale, grab it immediatley. if not, then get it anyway. despite a few glaring issues, Need for Speed: Payback still manages to be an excellent arcade driving experiance with a pretty good car list, graphics, on-road handling model, map features, and most of all, plenty of variety.

When I finish a driving section and then have a cinematic and then I start another driving section, I expect the autosave (which is the ONLY option. There is NO save option/button) to have saved....well, it doesn't. Quit at the wrong time and you have to play the same section again. And if there are cinematics that can't be skipped, tough luck, you get to watch them again.
