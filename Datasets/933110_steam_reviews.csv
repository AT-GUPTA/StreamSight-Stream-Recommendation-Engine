The smell of acrid smoke and horses' breath
As I plunge on into certain death.

The horse, he sweats with fear, we break to run
The mighty roar of the Russian guns
And as we race towards the human wall
The screams of pain as my comrades fall
We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
And the Russians fire another round
We get so near, yet so far away
We were meant to fight another day.

We get so close, near enough to fight
When a Russian gets me in his sights
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow
A burst of rounds take my horse below
And as I lay there gazing at the sky
My body's numb and my throat is dry
And as I lay forgotten and alone
Without a tear, I draw my parting groan.""

I am to the point where I have perfected the best open that should out pace the AI to the first age by about 8 to 10 minutes based on my early learning games. 

My score is about double the AI and yet it is able to keep pace with my perfect open where I capture all trading posts. Once the AI reaches the 2nd Age it really starts to cheat excessively. Sometimes building units it does not even have the building type for that unit. But in most cases it will have double and sometimes triple the players army size. 

It defies logic if they just spent the resources to age up and most of these units cost gold too. The only exception to this is home city resources however the only way the AI could possibly keep pace with me is if they are spending home city points on wood. As wood is critical in the first ages. And if the AI does not have a single trading post because I have captured all of them that means I am outpacing home city resources by a lot.

The games tend to always play out the same way. Even though the AI cheats itself a big army it's tactics always fail against me. I always protect the trading posts with a tower and have my age 2 army closest to the most likely trading post to get attacked first. It's always a mistake to rush the enemy after the 2nd age because the AI will trash the players army with numbers. Predictably the AI army hits a trading post and with a tower and a smaller army in place you can always pick off the entire enemy force. 

At this point you can go win the game or just toy with the AI until you have fully upgraded. The AI will continue to try and amass a big army from this point but if you rush in and thin out the villagers and stay on top of military units produced and destroy the military buildings the AI will usually just surrender. If you manage to take out all the villagers the game is over. The only danger at this point is the town center and you don't want to let the AI pick off too many of your units.

My biggest complaint is because the AI cheats even on normal difficulty it cheapens the experience knowing the AI does not play by the same rules and instead of playing counter tactics against me. The AI just uses a basic formula that bigger is better. So what should the AI be doing? Well it needs to turtle a little more and get something to deal with my towers. The AI needs to try and stop me from taking all the trading posts. As I view the trading posts to be the primary path to victory. This however would require the AI to quickly change tactics which at the moment it can not do. 

However what would make angry is if they just cheated the AI more wood and the starting villagers just took all the trading posts without earning the resources. That is the kind of thing I would expect instead of making a more tactics viable AI opponent.

I just think it would be nice to have a bit more push and pull without the AI cheating. It would be more fun for the game to play out differently every time based on player actions and aggressiveness. Perhaps I'm asking the impossible.",1708055602,1708055602,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This review used to be negative because the game was off to a rocky start with lots of bugs and crashes, but the devs have been releasing updates every week or two to fix issues. 

There are still many fixes needed- scenarios/custom maps still aren't fully functional.

        [th]Description[/th]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]💾Graphics[/td]
        [td]As this is basically a remaster, the visuals have had a good boost. Also some new features have been added to improve the experience. The ability to zoom in is a wonderful addition. Being able to zoom in the battles and experience the chaos is a huge plus. The character models have been updated and the environments have seen a great increase in density and foliage. The vivid artstyle also helps this game stand out and pop. The visuals are really good and a great improvement from the original. The factions do feel quite unique from each other. This adds an extra layer of depth and challenge. Speaking of layers, many of the factions have a unique visual style. I really like this as it adds immersion, and a feel of realism. [/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎮Gameplay[/td]
        [td]As a RTS game, this will require quick thinking and strategy. The gameplay mechanics offer an easy to learn, hard to master feeling to it. Unit formations do play a role and many factions play as that have a different feel to them which is great to see. I do feel like the unit is pretty small even for a remaster. Only 50 units feels like a letdown. The AI does feel pretty weak even on hard difficulty. I wish the AI had some tweaking but since this game is pretty old I don’t think updates will be coming. The in-game maps are procedurally generated and look really good! There is a huge diversity in terms of landscape. Ranging from forest, desert, some snow, etc. You also can create your own deck for your factions. Deck cards crant you free units, resources, and upgrades of your choosing. You can create your own cards and save them for certain builds. This gives an extra layer of replayability and strategy that I personally really enjoyed.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎭Multiplayer[/td]
        [td]Multiplayer is actually really fun here. The game is split between rank and unranked. I prefer this as it separates the more competitive and the casual players (well as best as it can). The ranked matches do feel pretty unbalanced because you cannot even out civ choices or teams before the match. This may be nitpicky, but worth noting for anyone into playing ranked online. Overall it’s pretty fun. Playing against friends was a joy and has issues with connection or network.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🕛Playtime[/td]
        [td]You can add many hours into this game. You have a healthy amount of replayability in terms of the deck card system, procedure generated maps, many factions, etc. I placed around 80+ hours and can see myself adding more.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎧Sound[/td]
        [td]The sound design is pretty good. The in-game music is pretty mediocre though. At Least the sounds of the weapons, cannons, and overall combat is pretty sharp and a good improvement.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]❗Bugs❗[/td]
        [td]Bugs haven’t really been an issue for me here. The game is pretty optimized in terms of bugs. You should encounter very little amount of bugs here (well from my experience).[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🔅Performance[/td]
        [td]Performance is pretty good for the most part. The only issue I had was putting foliage on max settings (switched it to medium). For some reason the specific settings really tanks my frame rate. Besides the complaint the game runs really well once you put the foliage on medium settings. I gotten a solid 60 FPS, no stutters and crashes.[/td]
    [/tr]

    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🔗Conclusion[/td]
        [td]Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition adds a lot to the table when it comes to a RTS game. The deck building system, many cool factions, and the amazing battles you can create are truly an addictive experience. This may not be the top tier RTS game, but I feel that it does a fantastic job for what it is. Of course this game is gonna have some issues, but if you are looking for a RTS game with a huge diverse set of factions and that is pretty beginner friendly, then give this one a shot.[/td]

The game, released in [year], exceeded my expectations and proved to be a strategic masterpiece that effortlessly blended the classic charm of the franchise with innovative gameplay elements.

From the moment I launched the game, the visuals captivated me. The attention to detail in the graphics is astounding, creating immersive landscapes that transport players to different corners of history. Whether I was exploring dense jungles, navigating bustling cities, or engaging in epic battles, the visual fidelity added a new level of enjoyment to the gaming experience.

The introduction of the Home City system was a game-changer. It added a strategic layer that allowed me to tailor my playstyle and adapt to various challenges. Customizing my Home City and unlocking unique shipments became a crucial aspect of my overall strategy. This dynamic element injected freshness into each match, as I experimented with different approaches to find the most effective combination for victory.

The single-player campaigns were a standout feature for me. The engaging storylines, spanning different historical epochs, kept me hooked from start to finish. Each campaign presented unique challenges and showcased the game's versatility in portraying diverse civilizations. It wasn't just about conquering territories; it was about experiencing history through the lens of compelling narratives.

In multiplayer, Age of Empires III truly shines. The matchmaking system ensured fair and competitive matchups, and the variety of civilizations and strategies kept every game unpredictable. The addition of new units and technologies for each civilization provided endless possibilities for experimentation. The multiplayer community is vibrant, and engaging in epic battles with other players around the world was a thrilling experience.

The soundtrack deserves its own applause. The music perfectly complemented the game, creating an emotional backdrop that heightened the intensity of battles and the satisfaction of achieving strategic milestones. The sound design overall was top-notch, adding another layer to the immersive experience.

While no game is without flaws, Age of Empires III comes remarkably close to perfection. The balance between tradition and innovation is masterfully executed, making it a must-play for both series veterans and newcomers to real-time strategy. Whether you're a history enthusiast or a strategy game aficionado, Age of Empires III delivers a rich and enjoyable gaming experience that will undoubtedly stand the test of time.",1706301501,1706301501,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Please, give a choice between the two - new and old. There is no information on what age the card is available to use, also using the slider to switch between builds is unintuitive. Old style leveling up was better, it forced to master nation! Don't touch things that worked great. In addition, there are many bugs, one of them: Act 2 of the campaign - The leader of the tribe is called Nathaniel Black(even Nathaniel B. is another NPC here). NPCs on island maps sucks so bad, they can't play these maps. I also have the impression that the game is poorly optimized, consuming much more PC resources, even if there is no significant graphics improvement(subjective feeling, don't tread on me). After some time I realized that game ignores deafults set by NVIDIA Control Panel - This game is forcing me to use integrated graphics card in my dual GPU notebook, and there is no remedy to force it to use NVIDIA GPU!

This version of AoE was made more complex than is needs to be, making it a pain in the behind to play as each faction is radically different from each other in mechanics on how they bring in raw mets and build units. this makes for a very confusing game where everyone is a bad disadvantage this will end up with you favouring 1 faction above all others because it gets to confusing to play the others.

good bit. like all AOEs it will keep you thinking, it's a good time waster and you will still have fun if you manage to over come the confusing mechanics.

Hard to ask for help to independent structures as Microsoft is powerful, like the European Consumer Network, or asking help to Steam which support mega corps like Microsoft\xbox studios at all costs, also of our gaming communities and quality of games.

But let's talk of the issues of Age of Empires III ""dEfInItIvE eDiTiOn!!"":

-It is a 50+Gb download.
It doesn't have:
-Chat log messages like it's 2006 predecessor, so messages to offline contacts can't be sent
-No contacts online status
-No contacts in match status 
-no player search
-no clan members knowledge (clan are just numbers)
-No explanation of Casual rank
-Oriented mainly to total casual and random players, more focus on ""city building"" and resource collecting (sort of pastoral landscape design) than a RTS
-Suffocation of competitive scene with implementation of unreliable, unfair, unbalanced, broken, time wasting ""matchmaking system""
-Introduction of new civs with DLC where new civs are made on purpose OP in order to sell more, create constant unbalances and issues... while instead the game can and must focus on base game working properly (also) to sell more.
-Focus on skins and models, instead of take care of bugs and issues like pathfiding, 
-Worse ever User Interface (UI) which is behind the causes of community building
-UX (user experience) cannibalizes
-Hotfixes come after 1 month
-MOST IMPORTANT for RTS competition and learning which strategy is all about: Recorded games do break after patches (they become trash), or also go OOS (out of synchronization) for not known reason and so aren't always replayable
-Huge amount of stuff to learn for a new player, basically much more than a University course, maybe an entire bachelor degree
-Matchmaking balance of games is a joke
-You feel like isolated inside a prison when you enter the multiplayer lobby, you can ask anyone and check what the forums say (the official ones and also other spaces)
-Tons of people left and I too now, I decided to focus on good stuf...
-Matches that are rated constantly have issues of lag or especially disconnections (many people drop during the game, making team games impossible - this is not temporary it's a long time issue)
-There are tons of issues part of them listed that do corrupt the competitive scene.
-User interface doesn't allow Hypertextual (multi tab) navigation and we are in 2024! the previous game did allow it, user interface is in all aspects extremely limited\limiting and clunky.
-The game is filled with smurfing and toxicity (a lot of these two are incentivated by how the system is: high rank players will have hard time finding with just the matchmaking a game, and also a UI\UX that is broken will lead people to be frustrated, isolated, angry)
-Rated rooms for supremacy games which is the base for competition have been not allowed.
So you can't agree to challenge each other like it has always been possible. This also damages the time of a player and the frustration .. you can't play with random players that have a totally different approach from you to the game competition, like ""sim city"" players who don't care but to watch villagers collect resources... (why these people come into team games if they do not care to cooperate nor understand what competing is?).
-Developers nor Producers answer polite, clear educated questions nor listen to suggestion on crucial matters.

Luckily I have quite some experience and I can recognize what is wrong, however things are not getting taken care of but skins, model, DLC selling\marketing, game breaking bugs get introduced and structural stuff is not taken seriously.

I am an player since before AOE I, I used to play AOE II in MSN gaming zone, I played since 2007 AOE III which UI was far superior to this so called ""definitive edition"" which is more of a beta test.

For me this should be awarded as the best Scam ever by Microsoft Xbox ""games"" studios.
Don't waste your time, avoid this ""software"" like plague.

I really miss the good times when playing RTS, where developers knew how to design a community and were competent.

Surround yourself with good experiences, good stuff. Do not waste your precious time with bad things.

This is my most sincere and informed advice, I really hope you will listen to it.

For RTS I will seek else, this is not about Real Time Strategy anymore.",1662918383,1704210627,False,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

You like playing as a colonising power? There is a home city card for that, you like making Turkish noises when you play as the ottomans, you can do that. This game like almost all the games in the AOE franchise is unique in the fact that every game is different, not a single time will a game repeat itself when you play it the way it did previously something always changes, the game can be a little sweaty what with learning all the build orders,the hotkeys but there is an option for you to play in a non sweaty way and still have fun, Multiplayer is where this game really shines, its excellent and deeply enjoyable playing with your friends, the multiplayer is stable and rarely crashes and there are multiple servers from different regions of the world depending on where you are at, it provides for a very smooth experience and you will rarely have issues playing the game, the optimisation is also good but not great, in short its an improvement on the original AOE 3.

New players in particular need to be aware that you need a solid 20 hours before you have a solid grasp on the game, it isnt too steep AOE 3 is noticeably a bit simpler than AOE 2.

Age of Empires 3: Definitive Edition offers a variety of game modes, ensuring there's something for every type of player. From the classic skirmish battles against AI or human opponents to historical campaigns, the game caters to competitive and narrative-driven players. The new Historical Battles mode provides a refreshing challenge, offering unique scenarios based on actual historical events. The game also includes all the campaigns, each offering a unique historical perspective. Expect 30-40 hours of playtime across all the campaigns. Playtime for other game modes depends on the player's interest.

The core gameplay mechanics of Age of Empires 3 remain intact, staying true to the original's foundation. Players still engage in resource gathering, base building, and strategic warfare, but the Definitive Edition refines and balances these elements. The developers have addressed some of the gameplay issues from the original, resulting in a smoother and more enjoyable experience. Unit pathfinding has improved, and various balance tweaks further improve the overall gameplay flow. Age of Empires 3: Definitive Edition introduces two new civilizations – the Swedes and the Incas. These additions bring fresh strategic options to the game and showcase the developers' commitment to expanding the content. Each civilization offers unique units, buildings, and technologies, adding depth and variety to the gameplay.

The multiplayer experience has improved, offering better matchmaking, improved lobby functionality, and reduced latency. The dedicated servers contribute to a more stable online experience, addressing some of the connectivity issues present in the original release. Additionally, quality-of-life improvements, such as a modernized user interface and hotkey customization, make the game more accessible and user-friendly. Age of Empires 3: Definitive Edition embraces the modding community by providing robust tools and support. One aspect I'll miss from the original release is the unlockable deck cards made the game, in the beginning, more of a challenge. In Definitive Edition, all the cards are available from the get-go, which might be too much to take away. The biggest drawback is that the scenario editor didn't get any improvements.

The visual overhaul in Age of Empires 3: Definitive Edition is spectacular. Every aspect, from the units to the landscapes, has been reimagined with attention to detail. The game offers improved textures, dynamic lighting, and rich particle effects that breathe life into the colonial-era setting. The attention to historical accuracy is admirable, with each civilization's architecture, units, and environments reflecting the time period with realism. The upgraded visuals are not only cosmetic but enhance the overall gaming experience, making battles more immersive and civilizations more charming.

The audio design in Age of Empires 3: Definitive Edition is a symphony that complements the visual feast. The revamped sound effects and music contribute significantly to the game's atmosphere, immersing players in diverse cultures and intense battles. The music captures the heart of the times and dynamically adjusts to the flow of the gameplay. The enhanced graphics and sound collectively create an audio-visual experience that resounds with the brilliance of history.

The single-player offers captivating campaigns that span different ages and civilizations, from the discovery of the New World to the Industrial Age. Each campaign tells a unique and historically inspired tale. The campaigns are not just a series of battles but immersive journeys that introduce players to the complexities of each civilization's history, adding an educational element to the gaming experience. One notable improvement in the Definitive Edition is the enhanced AI, which provides a more challenging and dynamic single-player experience.

The AI adapts to your strategies, keeping you on your toes and forcing you to develop new tactics in the heat of battle. This adds replayability and ensures that each skirmish feels fresh and unpredictable. Age of Empires 3: Definitive Edition's single-player offering is a triumph, successfully blending historical authenticity, stunning visuals, and refined gameplay. Whether you're a longtime fan of the series or a newcomer eager to explore the history through strategic warfare, this edition delivers an engaging and satisfying experience that stands as a testament to the lasting legacy of the Age of Empires franchise.

Overall, the game is running smoothly and playing well. However, there are occasional FPS drops during intense on-screen action with many units displayed. While this issue existed in the original game and has carried over, it's safe to say that it's the CPU limitations playing their role. It's not overly distracting or bothersome but might be more severe on a weaker CPU. The periodical FPS drops are noticeable but don't detract from the gameplay. I applaud the developers for addressing and fixing the major performance issues when the game was released, even though it took about six months. A turnaround like this isn't often seen in modern PC releases and is worth complimenting, as they actually dedicated the time to polish the game. While the game was initially incomplete and broken, with the improvements made over time, I can confirm that it is stable and polished to the highest degree possible.

The upgrades and cards unique to their respective civilizations also parallel real-world events and realities, adding a layer of conceptual depth that gives the game more substance, going beyond surface-level design.

While I don't know if this was intentional or not, the units have memorable voice lines that sort of stick with you after a while. There's only so much a voice actor can do with the few words they are given, and here, most of the units are brought to life with a handful of phrases.

There's also a lot of strategic depth to it made possible by the card and XP system, allowing for a wide range of playstyles. In a similar vein, the natives and revolutions open up a lot of possibilities and keep the game fresh even if you restrict yourself to a few teams.

They have ironed out a lot of bugs already, but more work is needed until the game is truly stable.
However, the game is in a playable state right now and I took my time until i wrote my review, as I believe that you can only rate a game after at least a couple of weeks of playtime.
It is a decent remaster, the network component of the game is infinitely better than the laggy experience of the original, the Swedish and Incas are a fun addition and the changes to the previous civilizations were smartly implemented.

My biggest pet peeve right now is the UX design of the multiplayer, you can't whisper or invite anyone from inside the game (unless you are in a chat channel with them or in their clan), you need to communicate with them outside of the game (Steam, Discord, etc.)
I hope it will get redesigned and this was just a barebones implementation. The original game has a vastly superior online experience, thanks to the UI!

All in all, it is quite a decent game, let's hope they fix more bugs and crashes and improve the menues ingame so the game's online population can strive and become larger.
As I believe that the remaining bugs and grievances will be ironed out soon, I will give the game a positive review.. for now.
If my expectations don't come through come early next year, I will edit this review appropriately.

As you can probably see, a lot of reviews and forum posts are popping up about changes that have been invented by their respective OOPs, are complaining about random changes actually requested by the community, or are filled by flaming from members of a few different groups that decided that this game should be review bombed due to political reasons, or because they think it's a waste of time since they prefer AoE2.
So, here is a short summary of actual, concrete pros and cons, as well as a short debunking of the most common made up arguments. Let's have a short FAQ about the misinformation being distributed as a part of the raids at the moment.

Q: Did the devs actually increase the amount of black people spawning for European civs?
A: No. It's the same as it was 15 years a go.

Q: Did the devs change the art style?
A: No. The art style is the same, the models are just more detailed. Some people are experiencing weird blurriness that will cause the game to look more foggy and ""cartoony"" as some people have put it, but there are a few workarounds (or you can refund and wait until they fix it) if that occurs for you.

Q: Did the devs remove the ability to name and customize your own home city?
A: No. This was an invented flaw, based on the fact that you get stock-home cities instead of having to make a separate one if you want to play a faction. You're able to name your city and explorer, and customize it just as you can in the original release of the game.

Q: Did the devs remove the ability to see units through trees, and see how many home shipments you have available?
A: No. This has to be the most awkward fallacious argument, since the UI elements and unit rendering through trees are there pretty much just as they were with the original release.

Q: I'm seeing some really random reviews complaining about the lack of progression. Why?
A: The ""no progression"" argument was picked up and hijacked by raiders after (valid) complaints were made by the singleplayer skirmish community about the changes to singleplayer progression. Basically what happened was that they made it so you could play any faction in multiplayer without being handicapped for up to hundreds of games, without grinding first. This was one of the most requested changes, since the existence of the home-city card unlocking mechanic was one of the biggest things that pushed people away from multiplayer when the game first launched. Several good arguments have been made to why the old progression system should be implemented into singleplayer, so we'll have to hope the devs will add that in the future. The singleplayer community's arguments are good, and it's sad that their gripes were hijacked and mangled by raiders and review bombers.

Q: Is this a heavily politicized release, run over by SJWs?
A: There have been some minor changes as well as some clear mistakes from the devs part regarding this topic, but the short answer is no, and this whole topic has been blown out of proportions. The devs basically ordered a short list of things to change from Native American consultants, as well as thought of some changes by themselves. They basically changed a few words in a few text files, and made a few mechanical changes (that were luckily good, as the things that affected game balance were mainly buffs to underpowered things, so the effects of this to multiplayer were mainly positive.) It has to be said, though, there is also a big downside to what they did, in terms of what they didn’t do at the same time. Basically, the changes they made were really lacking, and they didn't follow through with making all of the changes that should have logically been made according to the principles that were used to justify the changes they made. Several really weird things were left unchanged with the natives, and the Asian civs were left in a really janky state in terms of historical representation and accuracy. Several members of the games Chinese and Indian communities have already been vocal about this, so if you're interested in what went wrong with the India and China civs, there are plenty of posts around detailing the flaws there.
Regardless of your political stance, the changes don't really affect the game since the changes being referred to in ""OMG THE DEVS ARE SJWs"" posts are a few changes to text strings, and if they bothered you there's been a mod that reverts them since day one.

Q: Is this just a bad game?
A: Some people like it, some people don't. If you're seeing pages upon pages of copypasted ""AoE2 is the best AoE3 is for retards"" threads somewhere, you've just seen an ongoing raid. It's a cringy sight, I know.

Q: Why didn't they increase the unit cap?
A: Because, unlike other AoE games, III is heavily balanced around population costs and AoE damage, meaning that it becomes completely unbalanced and unplayable with a higher unit cap. It probably would have been nicer to have a setting to have it higher in custom games, but it's more of a small oversight that could have been nice for a few people, rather than a big flaw or something highly requested that was left out. This release is extremely multiplayer focused, and a higher unit cap setting wasn't a priority for competitive multiplayer play. If that was something you were looking forward to and won’t buy the game because of this, that’s understandable as well.

Actual pros and cons:
To be fair, let's go through the cons first:
- Some people are experiencing severe game breaking bugs, as well as other visual bugs. Be prepared to wait or refund if you're experiencing these. These include bugs that stop you from progressing in the campaign, connecting to people or seeing multiplayer lobbies.
- No singleplayer skirmish progression, if you're interested in that.
- If you didn't like AoE3 before, you'll most likely not like it now, except if the home city unlocking was your only gripe.
- The game runs very poorly on some systems, so you'll have to try your luck with the games graphical performance quirks.
- The clan and replay functionalities don't work properly all the time at the moment.
- Chinese voicelines and localisation is bad, and in some cases buggy as well.
- Several other localizations are buggy too.

Neutral:
- No public ELO in casual games, so no easy way to filter through casual games based on ELO, but also no ELO sniping either. Some people are really pissed about this, but it also fixed a few large problems with the original release. If this is an issue for you, you'll need to wait and see if the devs implement something to let high-ELO people avoid low-ELO casual games and vice versa.
- As stated earlier, some names have been changed here and there. If this bothers you, there is a mod that will revert the name changes back.

Pros:
- Tons and tons of new content, for both European and Native civs. Also, the Chinese can now use more than one army type. This includes new politicians, a few new mechanics, and an expanded new revolution system.
- Dedication to competitive multiplayer, in terms of both gameplay improvements as well as balance changes. One of the new civs is seen as a bit overpowered still and there are a few kinks left here and there, but if the devs development cycle is anything near to AoE2:DE (which everything seems to be pointing to), the game will be patched regularly. If you'd rather wait and see, that's completely understandable too.
- If you're not one of the unlucky people that have game breaking bugs, the server infrastructure is actually really solid. Cross-continent play is (when not bugging) surprisingly lag free. For example, Europeans can play on the Korean server without practically any gamebreaking lag, which is really nice.
- Fluid, competent and modern UI.",1603132765,1700696607,True,223,4,0.822150588035583496,6,True,False,False

This huge issue was ressolved. Additionally, many balances and changes + several new civs have made the game vivid now.

Update: African DLC added a colourful addition opening new possibilites. Looking forward for Mexico DLC.

However, there are a few bug which make some parts of the game unplayable (e.g. for me 4v4 MP matches always crash). Dev team should deliver next month a huge update to repair all those things so I hope the game will improve.

good old aoe3 with all the pros and flaws of the original game (like ai).

I think there are some problems with optimization - the fps is stable until late game period and/or battles, when it can drop to only 30-40 fps (in full hd on ryzen 2600x, radeon 5600xt, 16 gb 3200 mhz; max settings). On the victory menu it can drop to 3-4 fps in the timeline section.

the graphics are quite good and the textures are sharp when you zoom in, however on the maximum zoom out the textures are somewhat blurry. I have mixed feelings on the audio - it's ""ok"", but some sounds feel like they were played in a really low quality/bitrate.

if i remember correctly, in the original game the home cities could be upgraded with selected enhancements only after reaching certain level, now everything is available since the beginning",1602786889,1700649498,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Close your game completely after a treaty match (especially a long one), or keep monitoring your RAM usage, people with not enough RAM get tired of the HEAVY lags and resigns prematurely. Also keep an eye on GPU usage, the lags are also caused by the GPU dropping to 0% use.

Update III: Even though they tried to address the torps ""aura"" not being visible on certain terrains the bug is still present, in some maps the aura is not visible at all.
Matchmaking takes a long time to find players and the service fails when it does.


Update: Age of Disaster Part II.
They fixed the cav box, and the BASIC shift+click on banner to select all unoccupied settlers however they ruined all legacy hotkeys, WHAT A MESS.
They added ""Ranks"" on custom games (kinda), however it shows stats from Ranked games, if you have never played ranked your stats are 0.
And now the disconnection problems seem to be more frequent. This is really an early access game.

Age of Disaster Part I:
Quick Resume: AOE 3 Definitive Edition is worse than many early access indie games on steam.
Please note that my review is focused on Treaty game mode of the game.

I will be listing first the ""improvements"" over the legacy AOE 3.
+Updated graphics
+Ranked matchmaking for treaty.
and... that's it.

Now let's start with the extensive list of bugs, design flaws and how Microsoft can ruin an old game that only cheaters made look bad.

-How the system makes the teams in ranked matches is awful. I have seen the Top 20 players in the same team and 2 totally new players in the other with awful decks, basically you are condemned to 40 minutes of waiting to a painful 2-3 minutes defeat.

To make the issue even worse, you can invite a partner before looking for a game, the bad part is when the TOP 10 players invite each other and are in the same team. No chance of winning or having fun. It is just NOOB-BASHING.

The game should force Split players based on winning % and rank, and allow them to play 2v2, 3v3 or 4v4 only with other premade teams of similar rank. Using legacy aoe 3 ranks as template, right now the game is letting 2 brigadiers noob bash 2 corporals.

-You can't check other players deck before starting a game, making worse the point above.

-In some maps you can build walls over the water/rivers.

-The game is a bug fest. One team gets to make natives and upgrades while the other not. One team gets to make docks and go fishing/whales and the other team doesn't. Which is a HUGE game changer, especially for Portuguese civ.

-There should be a healthy limit on fishing boats, unlimited fishing boats when only a team can make docks is just unintelligent. A civ shouldn’t surpass 80/99/120 population either with fishing boats or settlers.

-Warships going on land due to bugs

-Legacy AOE3 had a bug were settlers got stuck on mills/plantations. now the bugs are even worse. The Hero/Explorer gets stuck in native trade posts, ARMY get stuck INSIDE mills/plantations, army in general gets stuck in walls (there are gates in front of them and they just stand still), settlers get stuck in trade routes while making walls/trade posts etc.

-Memory leaks all over the place. After each match RAM usage gets incremented by 2GB, until it starts to show heavy stutters until you end up in the ""AOE3DE.EXE"" is not responding screen. After the last patch, the game uses up to 8GB of ram itself after loading the map.

-Out of sync errors, and teammates getting kicked out 15-20 minutes in-game, sometimes even after loading the map.

And that’s it, we can say the game is pretty much a disaster. UPD for Badge :P",1604293736,1700607356,False,36,1,0.691654324531555176,0,True,False,False

This game seems to just get more and more unstable as time goes on. The last time I tried to play it crashed twice in a row. I've since uninstalled the game. Likewise, the game now constantly starts ""off center"" forcing me to ""alt+enter"" to leave and reenter fullscreen to fix. Why? It literally didn't do this a few months ago.

Alright, you say, graphics and stability are poor, but surely the game is fine? Once, yes. When I started I had a reasonable challenge from the hard A.I. Then they changed it so that hard blatantly gets free stuff to a stupid degree. It has an army twice the size of mine, can replenish that army almost instantly, continue base expansion and age up...with less than half the villagers I have? Yeah. Okay. And moderate AI barely even tries to fight back so fun factor is just completely destroyed.

Graphics, performance and gameplay were all good when I started. Then they broke it and have made no attempt to fix it. Of course I wouldn't recommend this to anyone! 37 hours be damned, I want my money back.

Edit as of 19NOV2023-

Have I put in additional hours? Absolutely. I loved Age of Empires 3 when it came out. I want to love this ""Definitive Edition"" as well.

Some of my criticisms stand to be modified since this was originally posted. Graphically, the game seems to be fixed and is much more stable. I would wholeheartedly recommend that you make use of the preloader mechanic to load assets before a match starts. It seems to help a lot.

However, I can't truly credit the game and its developers, since graphical stability wasn't even an issue when I first played the game. I stand by my red thumbs down because issues easily could get put in again...

Likewise, difficulty? Hard A.I. still gets magical free resources. They still can fly past me in Ages, tech up, expand their base, deploy an army 2-3 times the size of mine and near instantaneously replace losses to that army...all with far fewer villagers than I possess. It is physically impossible for me to be that incompetent and still possess functional hands.

I still would not recommend this. They fixed the graphics, sure, but they screwed them up in the first place so I'm not giving them credit for taking nearly a year to wipe their bumsies. Likewise, the game really isn't a challenge at Moderate difficulty and it blatantly cheats at Hard.

The additional time reflects periodically returning to the game. It takes about 30-45 minutes to complete a typical skirmish game, so that adds up, but I need to do it to see if the game still has the problems I observed when I was compelled to make this review in the first place.

I stand by what I said. I wouldn't recommend this game...but since I already spent money on it I may as well see if they fixed their product.",1648997743,1700422551,False,4,0,0.476082950830459595,0,True,False,False

This is not the same game as the old one, i find it worst in almost any way : 

1) Imagine. You made a game so great that making remake is successful, but you forgot to code the AI. 
Seriously how can the AI be so bad ? I never experienced this in a game before, this is awful.

3) The game has changed vastly, it's plenty of little change but in the end it's way less enjoyable (what's the point of having city level now ? all the card are already all unlocked and the number of card are 25.)

3) But not only the AI, the UI is all changed and not for the better i think.

4) Also 20 games and none really fun. I must say i kinda regret buying it.

5) In the end everything feel so smooth like is that really a game ? do i still play an AoE 3?",1637950810,1698273064,False,1,0,0.481009393930435181,0,True,False,False

It's a fun Colonial RTS where all the empires of the world try to be the best settlers in the New World. This involves battling other empires for regional dominance.

Whether it is the laser shooting flying pigs or the close 2v2 empire vs empire matches the game is a fun one. The home city development and calling cards add depth that isn't too complicated. You can call for units or building upgrades, resources etc. What the card says it does it does and they're separated by Age. There's many DLCs that they are still releasing to this day which is nice.

From the moment you embark on your colonial escapade, you'll realize this game is as historically accurate as a time-traveling penguin. But who cares about historical accuracy when you can send armies of flaming sheep into battle?

The graphics are like a Renaissance painting... with a silly hat. Sure, you've got musketeers and cannons, but you've also got monkeys riding elephants and pirates in poofy shirts. It's like watching a period drama where everyone's overdressed for the occasion.

Gameplay is where Age of Empires III truly shines as a comedy. You'll gather resources faster than a squirrel hoarding acorns for winter, and you'll train armies with a speed that defies all logic. It's like running a colony with the efficiency of a caffeinated squirrel on roller skates.

The civilizations are as quirky as your neighbor's lawn gnome collection. Whether you're commanding the French, the Germans, or the Dutch, each civilization is like a box of chocolates - you never know what odd surprise you'll get. And don't even get me started on the unique units; war elephants, pirates, and cows with flaming arrows - it's like a Renaissance fair gone wild.

The campaigns are like comedy shows with historical settings. You'll be part of epic tales that feel more like Shakespearean farces, complete with over-the-top characters, dramatic twists, and the occasional chicken attack. It's like being in a historical sitcom, where you're the bumbling hero who somehow saves the day.

The community is a gathering of history buffs with a humorous twist. Whether you're sharing tales of your ridiculous in-game exploits, discussing the absurdity of some of the unit animations, or competing for the title of the silliest civilization, Age of Empires III players know how to laugh while conquering.

In conclusion, Age of Empires III is not just a game; it's a historical comedy show that parodies the past with a wink and a nod. It's a chance to rewrite history with your own zany spin, to command armies of ridiculous units, and to create your unique brand of historical humor. So, if you've ever dreamt of leading a cavalry of clowns into battle or using flaming sheep as your secret weapon, Age of Empires III is the comedy history lesson you've been waiting for. It's time to don your silly hat, lead your quirky army, and conquer the ages with laughter. To history and hilarity!",1698253460,1698253460,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The civilizations have enough differences to keep you trying new strategies.

Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition is a lovingly crafted remaster of a classic real-time strategy game. It features stunning 4K Ultra HD graphics, a completely remastered soundtrack, and all of the original expansions and updates.

The game is set in the Age of Discovery and Colonialism, and players can choose from one of eight European civilizations to expand their empire across the Americas. Each civilization has its own unique strengths and weaknesses, and players must carefully manage their resources and build up their armies in order to defeat their enemies.

One of the things that sets Age of Empires III apart from other RTS games is its focus on civilization development. Players must gather resources, build buildings, and research new technologies in order to advance through the ages. This adds a layer of depth and complexity to the game, and it allows players to develop their own unique strategies.

Another unique feature of Age of Empires III is its home city system. Players can build and upgrade their home city in order to unlock new units, technologies, and cards. The home city system also allows players to send shipments of resources and units to their colonies in the Americas.

Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition is a great game for both new and experienced RTS players. It is easy to learn but difficult to master, and it offers a wide variety of content to keep players engaged.

Here are some of the things that I love about Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition:

The graphics are stunning. The game has been completely remastered, and it looks better than ever.
The soundtrack is fantastic. The original soundtrack has been remastered, and new music has been added.
The gameplay is addictive. The game is easy to learn but difficult to master, and it offers a wide variety of strategies to choose from.
The home city system is a great addition. It adds a layer of depth and complexity to the game.
The game is well-balanced. All of the civilizations are viable, and there is no clear ""best"" civilization.
The game has a large and active community. There are always people to play against online, and there are also many mods and custom maps available.
Overall, Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition is a great real-time strategy game. It is a must-play for fans of the RTS genre, and it is also a great game for newcomers to the series.",1696922262,1696922262,True,0,0,0,0,True,True,False

I was hoping for a modernization of the product with more features, features taken from the eso platform and starcraft2 (RTS made of gold in comparison), an even nicer chat and friends list system than Eso, impeccable balance, detailed (but not invasive) and user friendly, a professional observer screen like starcraft2 or age of empires 2 DE but all this did not happen, none of these points happened, despite the criticisms and advice, the lists written by the players and sent by pro players (especially the balanced of game) the Devs repealed every list every time, they just decided to add useless things, to solve some bugs as it should be but at the same time to make money through Pay to Win DLC where they forced you to buy it if you wanted to play tournaments or competitive (this really sucks). 

The quality of the product that was just released was practically in beta and has been for the whole year including the beginning of 2021. Afterwards, with the various updates they made it a playable game and little by little they fixed or added other useful but also useless things as DLC to buy new civilizations and make easy money while the game didn't even have 1 point mentioned on it, the game started to become more and more complex for new players and for old players who also had to learn the new useless civs with terrible RTS design (including many resources were reused from aoe2 and the wars of liberty mod so they didn't spend almost 1 penny to make these DLCs, including maps taken from the ESOC fan patch and only changed in name).

For me it is not a worthy product, many points are missing to make it finished and competitive but also for those who want to play it for fun, only of the idea that I have to use a third party program to play with a friend of mine because I don't even know when he is online in the I play and I can't search for players because there isn't a mechanism, I don't know if my mate is playing except if I write to him on discord, it's 2023 and there aren't even these mechanisms that the game had in 2005, I would say a bad step backwards with the quality, performance, interface and functionality of the product.

it's a thumbs down because they fixed bugs but the management behind it is terrible and their goal is only to spend 1 dollar and get 1000 out of it.",1615849134,1696604850,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Sure, there are more improvements to be made, and I know they are done as I am writing this review, for I paid this game with its DLCs once, but I am still getting contents years after the purchases, and this reassures me on the fact that the devs are hard at work on this game.
I'd appreciate more communication though.

If you liked the Classic Age of Empires 3, you will love DE, in short it has more quality of life improvements and contents, albeit this last part is also a bit of a downer, since it raises the skill ceiling to play it effectively: if there is twice the amount of content, then it means that you would need to learn twice as many things as before! 
This also ensues hundreds of hours spent on the game on the discovery of the various potentials of 22 civs, perfect for those who are curious to explore and have the creativity to develop strategies that this game offers, and this game will never feel dull, because as I stated in the beginning, the devs are still working on this game, every so often they release a patch to shake up some things in the meta!",1696531815,1696531815,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But Age 3 has become the one I always come back to.
For RTS Fans unfamiliar or unversed with AoE games:
---
Overall, I'd recommend this game to anyone interested in historical themes (not immensely educational) based in the Age of Exploration of the New World up to the Industrial Revolution, and enjoy relatively fast paced RTS where you can build settlements and engage in combat in the same match space. Its a relatively casual, fun balance of resource management/production, with live time unit based battles in the same space. Everything is self contained in a match, unlike anything akin to a grand strategy or Total War game etc.  

For Age of Empires fans:
I think the main reasons I continue playing and returning to this one are:
+ Having a Persistent Home City to Level Up, Customize, etc (Gives a sense of purpose, albeit relatively shallow, to engage in battles)
+ The variety of the civilizations and how they function mechanically so differently but remain fairly balanced. (I typically only play on Single player, Hard or higher if I'm feeling serious)
+ Having the Deck Builder, I admittedly loathed this feature when Age 3 originally came out, but I've come to love it, because it can give even more variety to civs you enjoy playing with and makes you focus more on specific things or strategies based on your assembled deck.

Like in other Age games, technologies are unlocked as you choose to advance an age (Exploration, Commerce, Fortress, Industrial, Imperial) which can be invested in at a certain resource point during a match. Except in this game (at least for the European/Colonial civilizations), you can choose to Revolt at the 4th to 5th age-up interval as various factions based on your primary civ- many of these factions are not main civs you can choose to start as.

Gaining general XP from units produced, units/buildings destroyed, resource gathering goes toward a Home City shipment counter, each time you hit an XP threshold you gain 1 shipment, which you then choose from your home city deck of your choosing (you can save several loadouts to choose from, however once you confirm which deck you'll use during the match, you're locked into that deck for the duration of the match [unless you choose to Revolt at the 4th to 5th age-up interval, then you are granted a default deck of the faction you've revolted as, which is often not a Main Civilization you can choose])

Units are generally broken up into Melee and Ranged variants of:
- Non Military (Civilians/Settlers/Villagers, Monks/Priests/Surgeons, etc)
- Explorer / Warchief / Heroes (Explorers you start with that have special abilities, and/or area buffs)
- Infantry, Heavy Infantry
- Cavalry, Heavy Cavalry
- Artillery
- Naval
and special units/mercenaries.

Trading posts are present on most maps, which you can build on designated plots, with non-interactable travelling merchants passing periodically. Holding a trade post will grant you XP checks as the merchants pass, later on you can opt out of the XP bonus for specific resources instead. Similarly, there are Native Settlements present on many maps, these also have designated plots for a trading post. Building a post at a settlement grants you an alliance with a gaia faction of the settlement, which grants you the ability to hire a limited number of units (outside your pop limit), as well as various technologies or resource/unit buffs which vary dependent on the faction.

And much more...

There's alot more to this one than Age 2. I never moved up to Age 4, my friends did not enjoy it- and I'm happy with this one.

When I started playing the game I had to get a grasp of the objective to be able to understand what to do. There is a whole campaign which you can do and plenty of civilisation which you can play as so I doubt you will get bored of it quickly. If you have a bit more money to spare I would highly recommend getting Age of Empires 4 when its on sale since the graphics and game play are so much better.",1695521537,1695521537,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's much like StarCraft or Warcraft and numerous others, where you rush about, trying to out-resource collect, out-build, out-technology, out army and finally out-combat your opponent in real-time. I was quite good at AOE 1 and 2, but either I've gotten older, the game has gotten harder or perhaps I've just realized the game and it's AI deal with us humans in a very straight-forward, single formula sort of way, and all we can do to make it more interesting is change the map or, essentially, is change one of it's many difficulty facets, including the one named ""difficulty"" itself. Maybe a bit of each. The game is colorful, but inevitably it will become the same exercise, again and again, ending when you finally reach a difficulty level that just makes you throw in the towel, for the AI is relentless only mitigated by the speed at which it levels up it's ""civilization"", and the number of opponents it's against. In the end, larger and larger groups of the enemy visit until, finally, a sizable army that can wipe you out does or doesn't. Survive it.. and the next one, and you know you're probably doing something right, which hopefully includes taking your army on the attack soon. Whether you manage to win 1v1 on Moderate, Hard, etc... will come down to your machine mimicking mind and an obsessiveness that allows you to ignore the relative DOWNSIDE repetition. I could see more fun in these games a decade or so back, but real-time stress makes a turn based game seem very attractive, being more the relaxed experience we associate with the word Game. --- However, playing multiplayer may be just the UPSIDE that makes it all worth it!

I got the original Age of Empires III back on disc when it first released but I never got the game's two dlcs. I was happy to see this updated edition of the game comes with all the old dlcs so after all these years I could finally play them. Age of Empires III changes a lot of things to the gameplay style of the previous titles. You gain experience from playing games and you can upgrade and change the appearance of your Home City of the civilization you played as. You gain these cards you can use during gameplay to send supplies, unites or upgrades as you play a match to benefit you.

The story of all three campaigns was fun and it will keep you busy, it can take a while to complete. Because this is the upgraded definitive edition, they added new expansion packs to buy that allows you to play as new factions never available to the old version of the game. I do not have these expansions but I plan to buy them in the future. If you enjoy Age of Empires, you will enjoy number three. It's a bit different compared to the older games, but it plays extremely well and the graphics is beautiful.

u can play chill session vs bots on easy mode and advance until u can beat 3 or even 4 experts alone :)

 The game looks nothing like it. While running AoE 3 on Max Graphics, Extra Zoom out that was adjusted in the files (to test FPS); I get a constant 60FPS with no lag whatsoever, it looks amazing and my PC doesn't cry. 
On AoE3 DE I get about 20 FPS on the LOWEST settings possible even after doing everything to boost it and the game looks terrible.

The new Definitive UI Layout is great but i'd rather stick to the old version than having a mental breakdown trying to run a game that sets my PC on fire.

All the little extras they've added here are useless to the non-competitive player base.

Wasted 15€ for a Downgraded Version of the Original game.

Edit: years later, attempted to play the new trial version, performance is much better, but the game is so incredibly blurry and you just cant read the terrain, its missing sharpness and crispiness.

The biggest improvement for me is the Naval battles and fighting, much more realistic with great animations and sounds.
However, the gameplay is a let down on land in terms of building, resource gathering, repairing and fighting, aside from some formation options.
The UI is also much worse then game 1 & 2 as is some other abilities and options.
For me personnaly i find AoE 2 DE, better, i would even say that AoE 2 DE is better. You can also still play these online so.
Aside from my opinion or facts, its not a bad game so you might like it. however i do not enjoy this gameplay in terms of resource gathering, building, upgrading, repairing, limitations and the UI to control and overview everything.
To give you some examples: You now have tower number limitations, the way you upgrade towers is just not logical, they removed a lot of buildings compared to AoE1&2, you dont need resource gathering buildings, you cant seem to repair boats and other things, you have a worker limitations when it comes to speeding up construction ect ect.
The graphics, sounds and specifically naval battles and also the zoom in has improved a lot but since i could not even enjoy a play through with cheats, i can't recommand this one, based on my great experiences of AoE DE 1 & 2 i really need to make a stand when developers go downhill when calling a game the same but changing the entire game.
They ruined Command&Conquer titles like this, and it feels with this one, they are going down that path with AoE as well.",1693131972,1693132264,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For players that played original version: It's everything you know but more and better. Stable connections, polished graphics, more nations, customization and whatever you want. 

For new/returning players: Game introduces few controversial mechanics when compared to AoE 2 like card system. Basically every nation has a certain customization level in form of cards that you may ""send"" to your game. Some are upgrades, some are packs of units if you are in dire situation or want to rush enemy. 
But besides that, it's still old schools RTS that relies on micro and macro management. 

For me, this is the perfect RTS experience, slow enough to enjoy it, but fast enough to test your skills. Almost every nations is very different to each other (No more cookie cutter like in AoE 2), cards bring  a ton of replaybality to your nations and each town can be visualy customized. DLC nations are fun but not super OP so we can't talk about pay to win. Music is absolute bop and there is a ton of single player content: 3 long campaings with full voice over, historical battles and challenges. 
Almost every RTS enjoyer should find AoE3 fun and interesting. If you get it at a discount, it's absolutely worht your money and now with free version you may check it for yourself, it literally costs no money for few hours of gameplay.",1691709210,1691709210,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

With its rich historical setting, engaging game play mechanics, and stunning visuals, this game provided an immersive and enjoyable experience for a beginner like me.

One of the first things that caught my attention was the game's historical backdrop. The setting spans the early modern period, allowing players to take control of one of several European civilizations as they embark on a journey of exploration, colonization, and empire-building. Each civilization comes with its unique strengths and units, adding depth and diversity to the gameplay.

The initial learning curve was a bit steep for me, but thankfully, the game offers an extensive tutorial that guides newcomers step-by-step through the basics. Learning how to manage resources, construct buildings, and assemble armies took some time, but the rewarding feeling of progress kept me motivated.

The graphics and visuals in Age of Empires III are simply breathtaking. The attention to detail in the environments, structures, and units enhanced my overall experience. Whether I was exploring uncharted territories, building bustling cities, or leading my troops into battle, the game never failed to impress me with its aesthetics.

The single-player campaign provided an enjoyable way to hone my skills and experience various historical events. It was both entertaining and educational, showcasing the richness of the time period and the significance of different civilizations' contributions.

However, as a beginner, I sometimes found the pace of game play to be quite fast and overwhelming. Managing multiple tasks simultaneously and coordinating my units during intense battles was a challenge. I would have appreciated a more gradual difficulty curve in the campaign or additional guidance in managing my empire more efficiently.

Despite the occasional challenges, I found myself hooked on the multiplayer mode. Teaming up with friends or competing against other players from around the world added a whole new dimension of excitement to the game. The thrill of facing off against real opponents was both nerve-wracking and exhilarating.

In conclusion, Age of Empires III is an outstanding game for beginners eager to explore the RTS genre. Its historical setting, immersive graphics, and engaging game play offer a compelling experience. While the learning curve may be steep at first, the tutorial and single-player campaign will help you develop the necessary skills to succeed.

In short yes I do recommend it now, test it yourselves now that is kinda free to play. Of all Age of Empires, I can claim its the one that had more content added, visuals of units, balances, civs mini-reworks, etcetera.

There are a lot of things added in each patch in this 3 years from launch that would be too long to list here. As I said above from all the age of empires series, this title is the one that got the most content, they heard us in the forums and they seemed to actually care for what the comunity wanted.

So if you are new or old player to the series without doubts try this one.

2020 Review (after launch)
I ll join the boat, since I am dissatisfied with it's current state.

Firstly: there are several issues, so far for me minor, but one I found for example. Ai having a big army and doing nothing, just sitting in base.

They change deck builder view and now home city is just a museum piece. Before as you built your deck you move around your home city. They didn't add customization for all civs.

Now renaming and changed gameplay, I thought it was nice till saw there was no Colonial names, they added new mechanics to only US natives, when aztecs used cacao as currency. Also many factions both Europeans, Asians and Aztecs have wrong names.

They left Revolution as it should be Independence, and they depict Mexicans as a mix of cowboys and revolutioners from 1910-1920. When they instead should be from 1820 Independence, using similar uniforms as Bolivar and Spain at that time.

It's not all bad, but the bad things are more than the good, graphics are nice, soundtrack too. 2 new civs, and they tried to make more unique each revolution.

If they change, improve things I ll change my review.",1602951324,1691090614,True,0,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False

grinding no longer required for powerful cards, meaning it's suddenly possible to introduce friends to the game without them immediately quitting because they dont want to play for 20 hours before becoming competitive

it's definitely buggy (moreso in lobbies/menus than in game) and crashes occasionally, but I think people who complain about this a lot forget that the original had similar/worse lobby glitches, and a far higher incidence of lag in games, making the new one strictly an improvement. sure, complain that the improvement isn't enough for your standards, but like with aoe2 DE they're still working on it and it will improve over time. and it's a $20 game.

Edit: the lobby bugs and crashes were pretty much all fixed :) at least I haven't had one in like a year

the only people for whom DE isn't a significant upgrade are people who want to grind for card unlocks more than they want new civs, new graphics, and new content. at least they can still grind for cosmetic upgrades to the original 8 home cities like old times.

my primary criticisms are just the performance issues and I think keeping the old visual card-selection trees might've been useful for making it clear to players when some cards are just more powerful versions of others. but these are minor complaints.

overall this game has me enjoying aoe3 more than I even did when it first came out 15 years ago. playing with friends in multiplayer is better than it's ever been, with slowdowns/lag being rarer, slightly less trouble getting into lobbies together, more friends willing to play since they dont have to grind, and balance changes that make a lot of annoying behaviors less-so (such as nerfs to walls).

so easily a strong positive view from me. it's a good buy if you like good RTS.

I like the original, but a few sound cues were unnerving, visuals aged a fair bit and I felt it was good but not enough to be played anymore.

I don't know why this version completely butchered the AI but by the 30 minute mark in my skirmish against moderate difficult AI they were still on Age 2 while I was moving onto 4, they build less than 40 military units, explored 0 treasures and just did nothing the entire time. 

In the original on moderate difficulty the AI kept pace with me, prodded my defenses and would rebuild their units. 30 Muskateers should not be enough to completely wipe a colony, that's absurd. 

They also took out the progression with all of the cards, added some that seem to just be better versions of other cards and monetized the hell out of the experience. It feels like very corporate remaster of the original with all of ""Wowie gee you won this weeks FREE PROFILE PICTURE!!""

To keep it short:
-AI isn't great, not even extreme AI. Most of the difficulty comes from the AI just cheating (more resources, faster building etc). Often the AI gets stuck doing absolutely nothing and wakes up only if you attack it. The way AI builds its base is pretty much how the AI built bases in an early 2000 game, c&c red alert 2. There's no sense in anything; there's just towers and castles placed around randomly without utilizing any walls. It's easy to exploit the AI and it gets very repetitive to play against it with its repetitive tactics and issues.

-G-sync doesn't work.

-The game suffers from performance issues especially if there's loads going on. For reference I have an rtx 3080, Ryzen 5800X, 32GB ram and the game is on an nvme ssd. This at 1440p and maxed out graphics. I don't view 60 fps as smooth anymore. 60 is minimum for average fps. Short random dips below aren't too bad but this game seems to never feel smooth. Maybe it's the lack of any sync in combination with mediocre fps.

-About half year from the game's release both me and one of my friends (not all) began to get an issue that sometimes the game wouldn't start at all. Verifying the game's files, restarting PC and trying again the next day didn't work. Then suddenly few days later it again worked and then it didn't. This continued for a long time and I gave up as the game stopped starting at all. Now after maybe 2 years later the game works again. I tried googling around on numerous occasions and couldn't find a solution.

Still, I like to play the game very casually with some friends every once in a while. It's quite fun but as an against AI player I wish the AI was much better, diverse and adapted to different situations. 2vs3 extreme AIs with 80% handicap felt easy the other day even though hadn't played the game for over a year at all and we never were RTS pros - we're casuals.

The story is fun but extremely easy to complete.

The online play has been ruined:

First one was unbalanced towards a few civilisation, but not extremely.

The extension later balanced the old civilisation slightly, but they provided new ""native"" civilisation that were very unbalanced and in a normal game a good player could attack early on a small map and it would be very unlikely to stop it. Many people just didn't let people play with those civilisations.

Now, there are a bunch of new paid for ones that have way too powerful units. The old civilisations, even the east Asian ones, are pointless. It takes variety out of the game.

The ranking is confusing and it's impossible to make a fair game, beyond 1v1. It would be nice if you could click ranked match and it would try to match people by rank, or make a fair mix. Of course you can just play 1v1, but not very social.

Pros:
Looks nice for an old game.
Story is enjoyable

Cons:
Online play isn't much fun because 90% of the civilisations can't be used, if someone has mexico or one of the others, then that team will probably win.

That newer incarnation is shockingly bad with little content and in no way worth even $30.00 AU!

Unfortunately the devs of the newer game add useless childish updates that nobody is remotely interested in  and what they need is more content.

And so here we are back at III and it is far better in every way.
This game offers much more content and honestly looks better than any of the previous and newer incarnations.

I play only single player against AI and not multiplayer.
The AI is not without its problems of getting stuck or not giving you a good game depending on maps and settings.

Playing this on hard or more truly is the only way to enjoy it for the rest are just too easy.
The game play is perfect I have not encountered any crashes nor bug s of any kind.
I have / 942.7 hrs on record so that speaks volumes I guess.

I have played the newer version via family sharing and no matter how hard I tried it just seemed so soulless so empty.
Like a top of the range sports car with no engine in it. Pretty lame then.

Some still enjoy II and its OK but this is more polished.

With III and II you can play in a relaxed fashion how you choose.
The newer game is just quite frankly odd and looks a little childish with oversized graphics here and too small there along with a rubbish zoom that is never quite far enough.


So this one is my go to and I give it 8.5 out of 10.

If only like most games the AI was better. We live in hope I guess. :)",1602825652,1690029907,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Ah, Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition – where you can rewrite history, one funny mishap at a time! It's like playing with a bunch of tiny, pixelated civilization dolls, and trust me, they have a mind of their own!

First things first, let's talk about the settlers. These guys are the unsung heroes of the game, building houses and gathering resources like they're in a frantic episode of Extreme Makeover: Colony Edition. They're like, ""Oh, you want us to build a town center in the middle of a dense forest? Sure, we'll just karate-chop those trees into submission!""

But beware, those settlers can be a bit forgetful too. You tell them to build a farm, and they wander off to the opposite corner of the map like they're on an all-you-can-explore vacation. ""Oops, sorry! I thought you said farm, not 'arm and leg' day at the gym!""

Now, let's talk about the combat. It's like a medieval rock-paper-scissors game, but with cannons, muskets, and cavalry. Your troops are the ultimate multitaskers – they'll fight, shoot, and die with the efficiency of an overworked office drone. ""I am a fearless musketeer! I shall... oh, never mind, I've been turned into Swiss cheese.""

But you can't have an Age of Empires game without some good old-fashioned sieges. Witness the magnificent sight of villagers armed with tiny hammers, taking on massive stone walls like they're in a David vs. Goliath contest. It's like watching an ant trying to knock down a skyscraper with a toothpick!

And don't even get me started on the wonders you can build. Who needs a history museum when you can construct the Taj Mahal in the middle of a chaotic battlefield? It's like your civilization is saying, ""While our villages are being pillaged and our people are dying, let's build a fancy tourist attraction!""

But the real entertainment comes from the diplomacy system. You can form alliances with other players, but we all know those promises are as sturdy as a sandcastle during high tide. ""Sure, we'll be allies forever!"" – Five minutes later – ""Betrayal! They're attacking us!"" It's like playing a game of ""Who can stab each other in the back first?""

But you know what? Despite all the hilarious chaos and wonky mechanics, Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition is a classic that's stood the test of time. It's like a nostalgic trip back to the days when conquering the world was as easy as clicking a few buttons. So, gather your settlers, prepare your armies, and let the historical comedy unfold in the most entertaining way possible.

It has the map fully explored, it knows your line of vision, it can attack you early, which wouldn't be an issue, but everyone attacks the plyer at once. It feels like you are playing against a team of 3, which wouldn't be a problem if that's the parameters I chose for the skirmish.

I really hope they get to work on the AI to make it less against the player. If the player is top score I wouldn't mind, but they gang up on the player even when the score is the lowest, you have defenses and an army, they just want to mess up with you. I think the AI on AoE 2 or even 1 is better, since there the AI fight against each other and only gang up on the player if the player gets top score. Also they don't have cheats unlocked.

It's sad because I love the game, and I feel playing it with the Ai in lower difficulties is pretty boring.

The final result is an expansive RTS with massive potential for replayability, with many civilisations to test and adapt strategies with.

The lacklustre campaigns from the original game return in this edition, alongside some challenging historical battles which have been included in DLC, but the skirmish and multiplayer modes are where the game truly finds its feet. The home cities mechanic introduced in the original Age of Empires III also returns, which allows you to request help from your empire in battle.

Graphics - holds up real good

Sound - excellent sound design. Cannon fire is always great! Just found some dialogue to be quite jarring (ex. when you select a villager unit from the US faction they'll say ""lumberjack"", ""fisherman"", or whatever it is they currently do.)

Gameplay - always fantastic and derives from the AoE formula although there are a few changes which may/may not be to your taste (removal of resource drop-off points and deck-building among others). The AI could feel quite dumb at times though, still, they provide a decent challenge.

And just gotta say, the large variety of units available is very welcome. The European civs may seem a bit same-y (but by no fault of their own - they are almost identical in terms of history) but the other civs really feel unique. For a history buff, that's a positive in my book.

Classy orchestrations for an entire game, a wonderful in-game base about the tribes inhabiting America, a map editor and a campaign that sparked a deep interest in history in me as a child. How many games were won, how many times the story was traversed. And it was still on a good old pirate disk with Russian voice acting, which was so nice that I was a little upset why it was not added here.

The game is awesome, I recommend it to everyone!

Yes, yes, I still recommend this game!


RU

ТА-ДА-А-А ТА-РА-ТА-ДААА 
Шикарные оркестры для целой игры, прекрасная внутриигровая база о населяющих Америку племен, редактор карт и кампания, пробудившие во мне в детстве глубокий интерес к истории. Сколько игр было выиграно, сколько раз сюжет пройден. И было это еще на старом добром пиратском диске с русской озвучкой, которая была настолько приятна, что я немного был огорчен, почему ее сюда не добавили.

Игра шикарна, всем рекомендую!

AI tends to be quite dumb. I had a game where their army entered my city through unfinished walls, and after I finished the walls while fighting them, they decided to retreat - only to reach the wall and just stand there while my soldiers slaughtered what was left, not even fighting back or attacking the wall.


Also it has a really really bad mod browser. You literally have to keep spamming ""load more"" to see all the mods, otherwise sorting by best will only apply to the first batch that's already loaded. I'm surprised there are thing such as rating the mods or setting their load order, but that's kinda all features there are.

Plus, the game's design just does a great job at preventing all kinds of lazy, annoying ""tactics"" and enabling actually fun gameplay and epic battles.

This has always been a really good and overlooked game, but this DE has really made it awesome and frankly, I have a lot more fun playing it now than I do AoE2 (which had always been my favourite). There's LOTS to play with now, the new civs are a lot of fun, there are TONS of really cool maps that keep surprising me with how good they all are, everything here just works and it feels like everything here was designed to be enjoyable first and foremost, regardless of playstyle and how chill or serious you want to play, including single player.

I was, however, let down by aoe4 and I cannot recommend that game to anyone. I heard lots of people say that aoe3 is the ""black sheep"" of the franchise so I avoided it for the longest time. 

I played aoe4 for like ~10 hours and uninstalled it (it was laggy, boring, ugly and didn't seem to have that much polish)... I played aoe3 de for ~8 hours and I'm loving every second of it! I even bought all of the DLCs pretty much instantly. 

So my take is: Even if you'd have disliked aoe4, do give aoe3 a shot. Don't mind all the negative stuff online. Some people don't like the Home City / Card system or the lack of resource drop-off points. Those never bothered me in this game. The campaign/story is way more interesting than in aoe4 and I think aoe3's story might even be better than aoe2's and that's saying something.

As a long-time fan of the series, I was thrilled to dive into this installment and I was not disappointed. From the moment I started playing, it was evident that the developers had put a lot of effort into creating an immersive and historically accurate experience.

The attention to detail in Age of Empires III is remarkable. The game takes you on an incredible journey through different eras, allowing you to build and expand your civilization from the ground up. The unique units, structures, and technologies for each civilization make every playthrough feel fresh and exciting. Whether I was commanding a fearsome European army or leading a native tribe to victory, the gameplay diversity was truly impressive.

Visually, Age of Empires III is a treat for the eyes. The graphics have received a significant upgrade compared to the previous games in the series. The environments are beautifully designed, and the animations are fluid and realistic. It's a joy to watch battles unfold and witness the intricate details of the game world. The developers really went above and beyond to create an immersive and visually stunning experience.

The gameplay mechanics are classic Age of Empires, but with some clever additions. The Home City system adds a new layer of depth and strategy. Being able to request shipments from your home country provides a sense of progression and allows for unique tactics. Managing your Home City development while simultaneously building your empire creates a compelling and strategic gameplay loop.

While the single-player campaign may not have the same depth as its predecessor, it still offers plenty of exciting scenarios and challenges. However, where Age of Empires III truly shines is in multiplayer. Engaging in epic battles with friends or other players around the world is incredibly satisfying. The online community is active, and the variety of game modes and ranking system keep the multiplayer experience fresh and addictive.

Although the AI opponents are generally competent, there are instances where their behavior can be a bit quirky. It's not a major issue, but it can be frustrating at times. Nonetheless, the overall enjoyment of the game far outweighs any minor AI quirks.

In conclusion, Age of Empires III is a fantastic addition to the series. It successfully captures the essence of what makes the franchise so beloved, while also introducing new elements to keep things exciting. The historical accuracy, improved visuals, and strategic depth make it a must-play for any fan of real-time strategy games. Whether you're building a powerful empire or engaging in intense multiplayer battles, Age of Empires III offers an exhilarating and immersive gaming experience that will keep you hooked for hours on end.",1687576913,1687576913,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

What I liked was the presentation with buildings falling apart and troops ragdolling after dying from a cannon. Also, despite not playing since I was a child, I was able to easily pick it back up and somewhat picked up on the rules for the newer factions.

What I didn't like was the small maps and the very dumb troop AI that takes about 30 seconds before it will do what it was told to due to it readjusting it's position multiple times. The campaign was also very boring and didn't make much sense half the time, with the exception of the Japanese story.

Overall, AoE 3: DE is not the best RTS I've played but it can be fun and so I'd recommend it to those who enjoy these kinds of games.

Great sequel of the original game. There's still room to further balance the game but it's slowly getting better and there's been a lot of improvements to the game in other fields like flavour and QoL. DE is definitely an improvement on the legacy game and much fun to play. 
Skill requirement for multiplayer bit steep though, don't expect to be a pro on day 1

AOE3 DE has great fast paced multiplayer (for strategy game, you know) that focused more on the battles than building eco. Fantastic variety of strategies you can try with using different card decks. Game still keeps updating with content and balancing patches. ATM there are 22 civs that really differs from each other (European civs are more similar though). Unit roster with mercenaries and natives is incredible wide and at the same time you don’t have to learn all of the unit names cause counter system is clear and simple (ROUGHLY: light inf > heavy inf and ranged cav, heavy inf > light cav and ranged cav, light cav > light inf and artillery, ranged cav > light cav and artillery, artillery > light inf and heavy inf).

What I think was better in original AOE3 is the ranking system with titles like sergant, master sergeant, 2nd Lieutenant, etc. I don’t clearly understand what ELO numbers mean without it in AOE3 DE. For newcomers I would highly recommend to learn build orders first for each civ before go into multiplayer. You might start with Otto (free autocreating vills) or French (vills has high HP that help against cav raids a lot). You know, AOE3 community is not very big, but very cohesive… It could seems even a bit toxic at first look, but also enjoyable if you stay in the game.",1684924749,1684935401,True,2,0,0.508928596973419189,0,True,False,False

I have hundreds of hours into this title, here are some comparisons from the original to the definitive edition.

They have sacrificed core mechanics of the game in favor of historical accuracy despite never being a historically accurate game in the first place. The native civs can no longer tame animals, which was one of their coolest features, and the North American natives can no longer mine and are required to construct an additional building to be able to acquire coin. Changing things in the game to be more accurate and considerate towards people who were presented in the game in a way that was ignorant or even disrespectful is fine, great even, such as changing the names of the civs to what they actually call themselves, but changing core mechanics and lazily introducing them is not. This is an absurd and unnecessary change that is an insult to veteran players.

A major pet peeve of mine is the change from colonial era to commerce era. Are you trying to tell me that a game, that is built around the theme of colonialism, around the era of colonialism and who's entire game play is based around building a colony can't have the colonial era in it because it is too offensive?

 Was colonization an awful thing for many people, YES, absolutely, but it happened and its what the game is based around, the game isn't making it out to be some glorious thing. This change of course does nothing to the actual game play so I'm not going to give up on the game just because of that but it is extremely idiotic and useless.

Home city progression has been almost completely removed. You can still level up your home city, however, it only unlocks the customization options for the visual appearance of your home city and no longer unlocks shipment cards, as you now start with all of them. While this works great for multiplayer as you no longer have to grind of out matches to get the cards you need to stay competitive, it is awful for single player. There is no more sense of progress or goals to work towards and the main replayability of single player is simply gone. This is the change that makes me just not want to play the game, I used to love unlocking and experimenting with different makeshift shipment decks as I worked my way up to the more powerful ones, but that is no more.

The UI is a complete and utter joke. The visual design of it looks as though someone made a bunch of text boxes in Microsoft Word and copied and pasted them onto the edges of the screen. The original AoE III had a UI design that was full of character and had amazing satisfying sounds to match. The definitive edition UI is completely soulless and had ear-piercing horrendous sounds mixed in with some rehashed sounds from the original version that somehow sound worse. To add on to this, the deck editing menu is nigh unusable, its essentially just a massive blob of the possible shipments you can use with very little sorting options. 

The original deck editor showed you what building the card type, what era you could get the shipments in and the progression trees all at the same time, allowing for easy location and identification of each card. In the definitive deck editor you can sort by age or by card type that's it, enjoy, and the cards are in a seemingly random order with no visual separation making it a long unsorted messy list of shipments that fit said categories.

I've heard many other people mention how poorly optimized the game is, but I have had no issues with performance as of yet, so be cautious in checking if your computer can actually run the game. 

One last thing I'll mention about the censorship of history because that is what really makes me nearly down vote this game is that every time one tries to censor what happened in the past to protect the present, what you end up doing is denying the victims their right to have it known that trauma happened to them. There's that old quote that everyone knows, the one that goes ""Those who forget their history are doomed to repeat it.""

The first thing you should know about this is it's a politically correct whitewashing of previous editions of the game. (For some of you, that alone is boycott material.) Personally I'm on the fence about it. Removing the racist tropes and aggressions is one thing. Expecting your ""loyal"" customers to finance that effort is another thing entirely. In previous editions, there were definitely cringey aspects that would make misc. people uncomfortable, and removing/correcting those to make the game more inclusive is fine. But expecting fans to pay to own the game again -- to literally pay to correct BHG/MS's mistakes -- uh...............

I mean, if you're going to try to be ethical, then why not tone down the predatory capitalism while we're at it?

Which leads me to the selectivity of the revisions...

As a cynic, and a purist, I also have a problem with where to draw the line on the whitewarshing. i.e. not all of the offensive things have been changed/removed. (YMMV and I'm intentionally not going into detail, for brevity and because I'm sure it's well documented on misc. wikis.)

There is perhaps a case to made that ""historically accuracy"" vs. ""artistic license"" separates things which remained, vs. were edited, but ... Trying to rewrite history of course you eventually run into the whole collision (no pun) of things like ... y'know ... trying to remove ""race-ism"" from the game when, in fact, that's pretty much the primary driver of any colonialism, ever. And overall trying to hide barbaric acts of oppression upon perceived ""weaker"" people in the course of those conquests when it's undoubtedly more historically accurate to surmise that such offenses were plentiful to the extent of being ""normal"". The whole game is pretty awkward if u think about it that way, right?

That time EA took the blood out of MoH comes to mind. Yikes.

Anyway..............

Overall, I liked the cards & trading posts mechanics and I thought this game was a great evolution of AoE when it first came out.

So at this point, I've paid these guys at least 3 times for it on different media and platforms. (""Check this box if you've paid for this product 3 times over."" :P) I'm not happy about that. [i]And[/i] I missed the one on GFWL when it was $0.10. That will haunt me to my grave. I gave in and bought this one on sale of course.

The ""definitive"" edition isn't anything to write home about in terms of ""HD"" upgrades. (um... are there any? Looks/sounds the same to me. I really think such claimed upgrades were just a red herring for the political correctness changes -- which, I don't believe are mentioned on the store page. :P) Nothing is really jumping out at me except maybe the wide-angle zoom-out. Something so simple should have been a patch for ppl who owned the game already.

Also they should have upgraded the AI more (allied AI, that is). It seems like they made it worse. Age 1 heroes trying to attack Age 4 treasure guardians (and of course being immediately slaughtered), allies building houses around my Karni Mata (structure that increases gather rate in a radius, which of course you want to build your farms and estates around), dominating all trading posts, never offering tribute even though they ask for it shamelessly, allies with a max-pop army idling half a screen away while my base gets raided, and ignoring my flares, etc.

Queued commands are bugged, attack-move is bugged (the old bug where it wouldn't show the cursor until you pressed the button twice, plus a [i]new[/i] bug, where, it doesn't even attack-move properly!); overall just a half-assed reissue.

Leveling and upgrading your home cities was a fun part of the game -- not only did i buy it 3 times but maxxed most cities 3x, too! -- but this was practically removed. Why?! Not to mention, if u didn't feel like leveling, you could easily do so by playing modded maps, or just editing the .ini!

Then comes all the the DLC add-on civs. And other microtransactions. Yeah. So much for it being ""definitive"". (It's also been brought to my attention that the free promotions which were frequent when the game first came out have been removed.)

Won't be surprised when they release the ""refinitive, definitive"" edition in another few years. Will we all be vegan and atheist by then, so hunting, fishing, whaling, priests, churches, religious ceremonies and other references etc. all have to be removed? Of course we'll be pacifist, too, so ... bye bye combat. We'll just build villagers and econ buildings. GG.",1641389213,1683435692,False,15,2,0.542617082595825195,0,True,False,False

The gameplay in Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition is incredibly engaging, with a wide variety of units, civilizations, and strategies to choose from. Whether you prefer to rush your opponents with a swarm of soldiers or build up a massive economy and overwhelm them with advanced technologies, there's something for everyone in this game.

From the unique strengths and weaknesses of each civilization to the historical accuracy of the units and buildings, it's clear that a lot of thought went into every aspect of the game.

Of course, no game is perfect, and Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition does have its flaws. Some players may find the pacing of the game a bit slow, especially in the early stages. Additionally, the game can be quite challenging, and players who are new to the RTS genre may struggle to keep up with the fast-paced gameplay.

The original and The Asian Dynasties are the only versions worth playing but because the game is so old now you won't find any games on those versions.

I would not recommend this game to my worst enemy. The developers could not care less about competitive balance. They think adding flashy, unbalanced cards and units is what players want. 
This game is titles as an RTS but the only strategy that goes on in this game is abusing and exploiting whatever unbalanced mechanic or unit the incompetent developers put in the game.
The community is so small that you will only see the same people and you can bet money that if you're seeing an account with no stats or very little games played that it is a smurf account. It's also so small that the main people who play it all know each other, have their own cult website ESO-C, and it's pretty much a cult.

I have been banned from chatting online because the cult all wrongly spam reported me yet are openly racist, prejudiced and bigoted, but you will be the one muted for standing up and calling them out on that behavior while they're left alone.

The only people having fun on this game are the casual players who are ignorant of how unbalanced the game is or the players who have fun abusing and exploiting to win.

Fair warning, you are basically paying for a slightly better looking AoE3 with two new civs. Now mind you, if this was any other game you'd probably be ok paying $15 for two new factions, or rather you wouldn't be ok with it but you would do it anyway. Consider that, and consider that you also get a discount on this if you own Age III.

A note on Historical Revisionism:

As someone with a BA in History, and who understands the current political climate, I understand and support why you changed the names of the Sioux and Iroquois to their preferred name. That doesn't bother me in the slightest, and it really has only positives for people of those backgrounds and cultures to support their representation. However, I find it problematic that you are attempting to erase the word Colony/Colonial from a game that is about the whole colonial system. You guys felt the need to apologize for creating this game in a climate that generally had no issue with these words, and you changed them to appeal to changing political climates. What you fail to understand, is that at least your campaign does a good job of explaining the brutal and unjust nature of imperialism and colonialism. The whole India campaign is an amazing scorch of British imperialism, as the Warchief section is a scathing and honest representation of US imperialism.

By changing terms and pretending this game is something it's not, all you're doing is attempting to conceal history. Terminology matters when discussing history, changing terms makes no sense. In the academic community, we don't alter colonialism from our terminology, rather, we acknowledge it for what it is/was and write or study it. Also, be mindful this game greatly exaggerates all societies and communities, and while some portrayals can be considered unsavory in our 2020 world, just note that the European communities represented are also stereotypes.

I spent many hours at LAN parties playing it with friends and family.  AoE3:DE is better in every way than the original. To be fair, i don't play multiplayer anymore, my gaming circle rarely plays RTS games together, and when we do, its usually Starcraft 1 in memory of an old friend.  But single player is more solid than the original.At first, I was worried that with making all cards unlocked at the start there would be no reason to bother leveling up home cities, but thankfully they've added customization options to each civ that makes it more fun to level each of them up.Gameplay wise, they've tightened up many areas, improved balance, and made the AI less stupid, but still not smart. Now, on island levels, I no longer find them unable to cope with the concept and stuck on their island.  They now send troops to other islands and the mainland... but they usually never send workers, so they get hamstrung by a lack of resources and building space eventually.  But its a definite improvement over of the standard edition where island levels were a gimmie.  I actually love the fact they tried to make the Native North American civs more true to the culture of the tribes they're based on.  I usually roll my eyes at pandering in games, but this actually feels right.  Trying to be more accurate to history and the cultures in question.  But i do miss their ability to tame any treasure guardian.  It was fun.  Revolution mechanics have been improved and made useful.  I love the added options this gives me to make games different.The expansions since release have been fun, I particularly enjoy Ethiopia and the Italians.  I hope that they add an Oceania expansion, giving us maps in the Pacific Islands, Australia, and one or two civs, like maybe the Maori and the Hawaiians.

?- I don't have much to say about the single player campaigns. I never played AOE2 or 3 for them. I play them for the multiplayer. 

-Where is match history?
-There is not an easy way to right click and check an opponent's profile after a match
- Devs need to add rejoin game if a player is disconnected in multiplayer.

Critics that say that AOE3 was always the worst of the 3 Age of Empires games must have never played AOE1. 

AOE3 is back, and this isn't a Definitive Edition like Warcraft 3 Reforged. This is a finished product. Buy it. The critics that put this in the 8.5/10 range had it correct.

Update 2-4-21: The last 2 patches have fixed the vast majority of multiplayer bugs that I'm aware of. They also have been proactive on the balancing different civs. In the latest 2 patches they have adjusted the Swedes by nerfing then slightly buffing, nerfing the Incas, and buffing the Chinese.  Player population levels are around 2500-5000 at any given time, and it's fairly easy to find a multiplayer ranked game. 

I think more AOE2 players need to give this a shot. Each civ is far more unique than in AOE2, between your card desks which includes unique cards, units, and resource bonuses. 

Developers need to keep it up.

Update 4-13-21: Developers have kept it up. They've added more bug fixes, optimizations, balance tweaks, maps, features, and now a new civ (The Americans). They still need to keep the bug fixes and optimizations up to polish it even further.  The African expansion is coming out  later this year. I'm having an absolute blast. Balance right now is better than it ever was with the original version of the game.

Updated 3-21-23: New civs, cards, maps, and balance. Far zoom out has been added! AOE4, take note!",1603412668,1679410845,True,3,0,0.527897000312805176,0,True,False,False

When it comes to RTS games, I'm a filthy casual. No fancy shortcuts, no grand strategy... 
I'm really just in it for the resources hoarding, the upgrades and the attention to detail with things that honestly really don't need it.

Ever since my first playthrough of AoE 1 all those years ago, I've always been about meticulously building my ""city"", landscaping it, and seeing what lies at the end of the tech tree. It's always been very satisfying.

One thing I always loved about the AoE games was their diversity. 
Lots of civilisations, lots of unique buildings, lots of unique destinations, and the history lessons.

AoE 3 was always lacking in the latter, but this re-release sought to correct the record. And I love it for it!
Where AoE 3 shined in my opinion was the sheer variety...

You have Civs that can break into other civs mid-game with their own advantages and drawbacks, a mountain of unique troops that can vary depending on which map you're playing... VISUAL TRANSFORMATION OF UPGRADED TROOPS!!! I always loved that one.

So yeah, I won't tell you about the merits of X strategy vs Y, about how falconets are OP or how this civ gets cumstered by others. I know nothing about that and frankly don't care.

An enormous variety of unique units and civs and depth of gameplay mechanics
Beautiful graphics and music

Cons apply to multiplayer:
Attack move doesn't work properly often and its very frustrating.  Unit priorities are horrid and you will constantly have to babysit your gatherers gettin stuck on each other and hunting wandering out of range of their auto gather.
Some civs are so braindead easymode to play where you will have to be twice as good as your opponent to beat them, it feels like shit.  Awful civ diversity at all brackets.
Much of the game, and powerful pay 2 win civs are locked behind overpriced dlc.
Many bugsdon't get fixed and poor optimization.
 Infested with chinese cheaters. The number of cheaters you run into is unacceptable.
Horrible balance. some civs left behind in balance completely overshadowed by DLC and reworks.  The devs give buffs to S+ tier civs and will nerf the worst performing civs.  

Its an excellent game if you don't care about balance and cheaters in PVP.  I do and that is why I unfortunately can't recommend it.",1662783672,1676343108,False,1,1,0.461956530809402466,0,True,False,False

Despite being marketed as an improved version of the original game, the optimization is poor, and the graphics are even worse. The game struggles to run smoothly, and the visual upgrades do little to enhance the overall experience.

One of the major problems with the Definitive Edition is the lack of improvement to the gameplay. The new AI is a far cry from the old one, and often freezes or fails to react appropriately. This can be frustrating for players who are used to the smooth and seamless gameplay of the original game.

Another issue with the game is its pay-to-win mechanics. The introduction of new factions and the ability to purchase upgrades has changed the game's dynamic, making it less enjoyable for those who prefer a more balanced experience.

Additionally, the timeline in the game is broken, and the inclusion of the USA in the timeline makes little sense. The Ottoman Empire, in particular, is stuck in the 16th century, and requires a new age with new types of units. The current system of cards is not enough to sustain late-game play, and the lack of a proper rework for both the German and Ottoman factions is disappointing.

In conclusion, AOE III: Definitive Edition is a disappointing cash grab that fails to live up to its name. The optimization and graphics are poor, the new AI is frustrating, and the pay-to-win mechanics are a major drawback. The broken timeline and lack of proper rework for the factions make it a game that is best avoided by fans of the franchise and strategy games in general.",1603627211,1676202703,False,6,0,0.572222232818603516,0,True,False,False

Bugs/Glitches/Lag.
Sometimes during big battles (200 or more Units) the game lags a little, not a lot but it still lessens the experience overall.

Graphics.
The Graphics are superb compared to the original in fact its down right beautiful in my opinion, the units and maps are wonderfully built and modeled.

Why my Review is Negative.
Let me start this off by stating that I loved the original Age of Empires III, the Campaign was amazing and I still remember a great deal of it even now many years later.
People have pointed out that you are given every Nations Cards right at the start rather then earning them as you level up your Nations while yes for online play this is more then fair, in single player mode I would have liked to earn the Cards like in the old version made you do and this lessened the game for me if only slightly.
So why the Negative Review then, the changing of Character names is alright with me I don't mind it that much at all and if it is based on real historical accuracy then why not in my opinion.
So you ask ""what made this Review Negative then?"" well here it is... the fact that the games Campaign was changed to the point that I did not recognize the 5th Act at all is enough for my Negative Review, but what angered me to the point of wishing that not only had I never played this almost sacrilegious version of the game I found myself wishing they had not made this version at all and they had simply ported the old game over to Steam as it was, My hate of this ""re-imagined"" game is so great that I found myself wishing that I had never even played the Original version of the game at all so that my childhood was not attacked so violently, the new ""voice acting"" was so bad it felt like a MOD made by 8 year old's and the ""dialogue"" was such that I found myself regretting being born with ears at all, the Snowflake language and apologies at the start, the $hlt dialogue, the changing of stories to be more ""modern"" and ""progressive"" has made me hate what was once a great game, ""but Arch ask for a Refund"" no I will never ever ask for a refund every time I open Steam I want to see this game I want to never ever lose the feeling of betrayal and hate that I feel now for this version and for the Snowflakes that made it, shame on you all for doing this to such an amazing game and story.

In closing if they give you this game for FREE with a $5.000 Steam Gift Card thrown in don't take it it's a trap go find the Original and play that version, don't ever pay them for this game they need to know that what they did was wrong and unforgivable.",1658804691,1675235204,False,3,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I love them all (Age of Mythologie included, that's the second best in my opinion) but I have to say that AoE3 is absolutely my favorite.
I just adore the different playstyles every single Civ offers and that every one of them can also be played in different ways thanks to the Homeshipment system.
Every Civ feels so unique, especially since every one of them has multiple different special units (and a lot of times: buildings) exclusive to them.
And I'm so happy that until today, they still create new and exciting content to expand on this with new Civs and updates for the old ones.
Don't get me wrong, I love AoE2 (the ""best"" Age for most people) a lot, especially because I'm an absolute nerd about everything medieval.

If you hear and read about the game these days, it is usually referred to as the ""worst part of the Age series"" and the ""black sheep"", even though the game received very good reviews when it was released.
I wonder, why is that? Is it because it is really bad? Or rather because it is overshadowed by AoE 2?

Either way, AoE 3 is an absolutely fun game. Time wise, it takes place directly after AoE 2 in the early 16th century and goes on until about the end of the 19th century. Where knights and swordsmen used to dominate the battlefields, muskets and artillery are now to be seen.

As someone who grew up with AoE 2 and first tried the game 10 years ago, I downright hated AoE 3 because it was too different for me. As I've looked more into the game with the DE now, I've realised how good the game is when you don't look at it through the partially nostalgia-soaked AoE 2 glasses. The game has many ideas that can now be found in AoE 4 (e.g. the Ottoman vizier system, which is very similar to the home city system) and are celebrated by players there.

Speaking of the home city: as an AoE 2 player you have to think of it like freely choosable civ bonuses. You put together a deck with up to 25 cards for the first four Ages that grant you various bonuses, e.g. settlers, units or resources.

The maps themselves are a little more lively and interactive due to the collectable treasures. These are RNG-based and offer various bonuses, such as resources, units or permanently additional HP for buildings. There are also native settlements on the maps that provide units and technologies, as well as trade routes that grant experience or one of the three resources.

Something I still can't stand, though, is the snaring mechanic. This temporarily slows down units that were hit from behind, which makes the controls a bit inaccurate for me.

As an AoE 2 main, I can recommend AoE 3, as well as the rest of the series, to everyone. If you were turned off by the game back then, give it another chance with DE.",1673111675,1673111675,True,52,0,0.842271149158477783,3,True,False,False

As a long time fan of the 'Age of' series I have played every single game in the franchise starting with Age of Empires when I was around 7yo. AoE3 was the only game in the series that I couldn't get into and that was until I decided to try once more when I found out about the Definitive Edition. Changes made to the UI (there are 3 UI layouts to choose from) and countless improvements made this game a fantastic experience, a must-play for any RTS genre fan. It has a steeper learning curve than other games in the series but it's easy to start, very enjoyable and feels like the good old Age of Empires which is everything I could have asked for. Also, music and the audio layer are brilliant which has been a standard in the series since it's very beginning. 

Hey devs, please add Poland and the Siege of Vienna (July 17–September 12, 1683) as a campaign, this would be a brilliant addition to the game. Let the Winged Hussars arrive :)",1672995396,1672996126,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

  So since this is a review of the definitive edition and all three of the classic Age of Empires titles have been out for a long time now, it is pretty much impossible to review this one without comparing it very directly to the prior releases. As a whole, AoE and AoEII are much more open, much more versatile experiences that can give just about any kind of RTS player something to enjoy. In comparison, AoEIII has much, much smaller maps, oppressive feeling unit/structure caps, and very simplified mechanics. It isn't bad but in comparison to the others, it isn't nearly as good. 

 There are going to be players that want a very tight, very focused competitive friendly experience and in that capacity, the game is pretty decent. For those that want something that hearkens back to the older titles, it will be a constant struggle to deal with the restrictions placed in your way. Matches don't really get any room to open up and breath. Nothing feels very epic in scale. 

  Again. It isn't a bad game. It is good at what it is trying to do. It is just a shame that they tried to shoehorn competitive style mechanics into a franchise that doesn't really needed it.",1672962274,1672962274,False,6,0,0.486723333597183228,0,True,False,False

What is this game? i thought i was getting an AOE game this nothing like AOE they've completely changed the core mechanics and they couldn't even be bothered to put a tutorial in the game to explain anything they just throw you in expecting u be a clairvoyant to know how to play, Ive been long time AOE player I played 1 and 2 extensively as a kid and have loved the DEF Editions of both those on steam i missed out on AOE 3 back in 05 when it came out so i thought being fan of the series I would pick this one up and give it a go its AOE right? itll be fun the graphics look amazing, oh hey 1700ish time period cool! except it wasnt, nothing in the game made a lick sense, the core gameplay has been overhauled to card decks? ok sounds nice I suppose, except it wasnt, theres some kind of werid shipment system from your home city on the main menu screen ok, wtf does it do? how does it work? who knows? the campaign will explain all that surely? Nope it doesnt at least not early enough that i ever caught wind of anything first mssion i clicked  just had waves enemies attacking my base and with no towncenter in sight?, tired another one and it had me send my heros into a town then once again it didnt explain anything for some reason my workers  couldnt mine gold now huh? theres a bunch of new buildings and missing old buildings, its all a secret I guess? Im truly baffled that game from respected series like AOE would so arbitrarily change the core game play not even give you a tutorial even the awful  CNC 4 at least the decency to have tutorial. This game reminds me of what ea did to CnC! its AOE in name only I would have been at least somewhat more lenient on these changes if they had bothered to explain any of them, so i cant recommend this game even to AOE fans.  Im requesting a refund maybe ill try out AOE 4 instead. all in all these changes might've been somewhat interesting but they make no sense and its 3rd entry into the series and nothing like its predecessors add new things sure but at least stick to the basics thats why people keep coming back in the first place",1672885087,1672885087,False,1,5,0.458333343267440796,0,True,False,False

One big change - they did away with levelling to unlock cards. Now you've got all of them at the start and levels gets you cosmetics for your 'home city'. Makes deck building more like a 'spec' if you will. 

A downside - some of the cosmetics are gated on time limited events. Not a fan of that, I hate exploiting FOMO. But at least it's just limited to cosmetics.

AOE3 vs AOE2

UNIT COUNTERS are much harder in AOE3 compared to AOE2.

CIVS are much more varied in AOE3 compared to AOE2. In AOE2 you can play most civs without fully understanding them as they all are very similar. In AOE3, each civ is almost entirely different, so you have to commit more to learning each civs playstyle.

ECO is MUCH easier in AOE3 compared to AOE2. Very little micromanaging in comparison. If you hated AOE2's eco management, this might be the game for you.

All the textures, vfx, etc. is updated yet remains extremely close to the original. The new UI is there for more modern standards but you can restore the original one and even mix-and-match parts of both (and the original of course supports all kinds of resolutions, just like the rest of the game up to 4K). 

I never bought this to play multiplayer so I cannot say how fun that might be, I'll just say that the game recieved a LOT multiplayer balance updates and even new nations in form of paid DLCs (which could be earned for free around release with grinding games). 

I however, sadly experienced a lot instability and crashing without and error message during the campaigns which was not present on release, only after many patches, however ultimately made me quit playing because they were so frequent, and customer support just vanished in the middle of our conversation after I provided them everything they asked for. Gave it another chance another year later and now I can play it again without any crashses, so who knows? It might be perfectly stable for me now, it might not remain so. Fair warning. 

If you want to play multiplayer I'd strongly advise to pick up AoE4 instead, however if you are in for the nostalgia and leveling up cities and such, AoE3DE is just as good as the original AoE3 was, except more content rich, updated to modern standards, and could be a bit unstable depending on the patch version.",1618943920,1672144910,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game absolutely sucks. I played a lot of this game as a kid and I may be blinded by nostalgia, but it was infinitely better when on a disk. Firstly, the pathfinding is still god-awful. In some of the areas the ai just refuses to go in an area, despite it being a totally valid spot for them to go. I've lost armies in missions and had to restart because I tell them to go somewhere and they, simply, don't. Secondly, the AI on hard (which is all i've played on) is just pathetic. It's a 50/50 with what you'll get whenever you load into a campaign game. You might get an AI that actually pressures you, albeit with their starting troops, or you'll get an AI that shits the bed, doesn't build any troops, and sits in its base until you complete whatever horrible objective is designed for this mission. Oh wow can't wait to have to build up 6 arty pieces and go destroy a fort again. Can't wait to have to do that for every single mission. It's just boring and recycled gameplay. And come on, in game cutscenes STILL? It is literally 2022. The view actual cutscenes in this game look amazing but they're tainted by the in-game cutscenes' mere existence. They're just ugly and the studio is obviously capable of making real cutscenes, but they just don't want to.

Edit: Also unit and building caps? Are you joking? What is even the point? What a lazy and shit way to balance your game.",1671782515,1671782891,False,0,0,0.37464556097984314,0,True,False,False

Guys I've played in all of the Age of Empires before and love all of them including the newest 4 but Age of Empires 3 is my best! The unique nations. the hometowns. I love it. 
Graphics: 6/6
+ It was Amazing when it was released even got award I think for it and it is still beautiful in Definition edition.
Audio: 6/6
+ Freaking amazing. I love what they did with the main theme. Fits perfectly.
Gameplay: 5.5/6
+ One of the best and intuitive that I've experienced.
- When you have an army with multiple types of units you should be able to quickly go to this particular type by double click on the portrait. It would be useful. 
Story: 6/6
+ I like the idea of mixing the family story into the historical context. Makes it more interesting than just dry history.

The main innovations/challenges are (i) the fast pace of the game and (ii) the highly-differentiated nature of the factions. This makes makes the learning curve steeper for beginners especially compared to AoEII.

Fortunately, in the Definitive Edition, there are now learning scenarios (""the Art of War"") geared to helping newcomers master basics for single-player as well as multiplayer. There is also a plethora of good-quality videos created by aficionados on YouTube. These tutorial videos are also helpful in understanding the roles and strengths and weaknesses of the different units (e.g. musketeer vs skirmisher, culverin vs falconnet)

Moreover, the strong differences between factions makes for a very unique playing experience each time, not only between the major faction ""families"" (African, Indigenous American, Revolutionary American, Asian and European), but also within these families (e.g. Dutch vs French, Ethiopian vs Hausa, Mexico vs United States).

This game is very much alive, with many free comprehensive updates/balance changes released by the developers, a strong multiplayer scene and high-quality DLCs (especially the Knights of the Mediterranean, but the African Kingdoms was also innovative). Personally, I would like more historical scenarios to allow me to get to grips with the factions in the same way that AoEII did. However, I can only commend that time that the developers are devoting to develop new fully fleshed-out factions (e,g. Ethiopia, Italy, Hausa, Malta, Mexico) and new maps/game modes (e.g. Tycoon). Besides, there is already so much content in the game that one can acquire the DLCs (or not) when one is ready to try out new factions: no need to buy them all at the start to enjoy the ""complete"" experience.

All in all a thoroughly enjoyable experience if you are willing to invest the time to understand the game.",1669588987,1669588987,True,5,0,0.563139021396636963,0,True,False,False

Now on the positive points, starting with the mods: there is full Mod integration and no unfair contract clauses (like a certain other company tried to do); at launch, the game was rough when it comes to optimization, but constant updates sorted that out; Two (also Italy with the DLC) Civilizations that were originally cut from the original release, many new maps, being introduced constantly, the old Italians 'rescued' from early development as well as completely NEW Civs in DLCs introducing African and full-ledge Revolutionary American Civs; speaking of which, the old Revolution option is still there for Europeans and has been expanded to include more nations; new single and multiplayer modes; events with rewards that can earned by just playing the game; new customization for Home Cities that didn't had it; the entire card progression is unlocked from the start, the levels only unlock said customizations; and much more being worked on by the developer.

I have played age of empires since the 2nd one was released in the late 90's. I also played age of empires 3 before the remaster. This will mostly concern my experiences with online-play. Having now played over 700+ hours of this since it's release i have come to a definitive conclusion. It's garbage. And i don't say that lightly. Mind you, if you are looking for a casual ""strategy""-based game (i say ""strategy"" because i don't think the game involves much strategy anymore, more on that below...) then you might give this a go. But for someone like me who has been a big age of empires fan for most of my life, this game makes me both sad and angry. Of course, here are of some good aspects of this game, but most of that is down to the previous work done by Ensemble Studios. And while the new team has taken to improve certain aspects and mechanics that the original had problems with (such as out-of-sync errors) one should not ignore the massive steps (in the wrong direction) that have been taken when introducing DLC or when the game is being patched. To list all the issues i have - and there are MANY - would take a long time, so think it will suffice to say that whereas there was once numerous ways of winning a match, and the game was more reliant on the concept of 'rock-paper-scissor' when fighting with units. This sense of balance is now of course history, and with each new (ridiculous pay2win) DLC or even with major patches and updates, the game moves further away from skill-based game play. Instead, one is able to win easily by just using one type of unit no matter what your opponent uses against it. With every new patch a new feature is introduced that ends up being ripe for abuse, and there is almost always a guarantee of there being a bug or glitch added in the process that ends up having to be patched a week or two later. It reeks of incompetence and ignorance of how or even why some mechanics existed in the first place - and that's not even mentioning the DLC's that have been added since its release that ads yet another stupidly designed nation (enter Sweden, USA and Mexico) that is almost a guaranteed win if you know the basics. This has damaged me to the point that sometimes i eve take to removing players from the matches i host just because they play as a certain civilization. There is no balance or even understanding of the word. But i get it. of course they have to make every DLC attractive, which sadly involves the practices stated above. In a perfect world, one would hope that no developer sacrifices balance in favor of the promise of fat green stacks of money. For those of us who wish for a skill-based strategy game, one should definitely look elsewhere. This game is not for you, at least its not for me.",1669308239,1669308239,False,7,0,0.49662327766418457,0,True,False,False

The thing that makes this game great is that every expansion and every refinement of existing mechanics has been done based on community feedback. The Forgotten Empires team obviously pays close attention to what the players would like to see and do, which is critical to keeping an old game like this feeling fresh and relevant. They've also done an excellent job at expanding the game to include interesting new civilizations and maps the fans have always wanted to see, like the United States, Africa, and most recently, Europe. Yet even without any of the DLC's, the base game still includes the original 2 expansions (The War Chiefs & The Asian Dynasties), which is a great deal by any metric.

　It's great to see classic games being updated or remastered to meet modern gaming standards. There are many visual improvements in Age of Empires III over its predecessor. The high resolution of the new texture is very pleasing to the eye. The story character now looks sharper than ever. Physic is now kind of different, and building or ship destruction has more particles. The quality of the effects is also better than ever. Overall, it looks great.

　Here's the problem with AOE III. Many people still hate the original because the gameplay is so different from AOE II. Back in fort units while gathering is removed, the rock or stone resource is gone, and AOE III does feel faster than the successful previous game.

　Here the things I remember I enjoyed AOE III when it first time release even many people hate it, it has it's own gameplay, it's own visual, and the gameplay was quietly kinda new for me at the time. when the definitive edition has been announced. I'm really excited to see AOE III in its new look. But when I played AOE III, DE, I don't even know why it felt more frustrating than I remembered. Many civs, including their own playstyle, have been updated, and the changes are significant. Consider AOE II, where almost all of the civs have the same gameplay mechanics as the base, and the difference is in the bonuses each civ provides. But in AOE III, DE, it's not just a bonus that's changed, but their main gameplay mechanics have also changed.

　I don't mind about the Asian mechanic to build a wonder to progress to the next age. But the thing I really hated about the DE was how we produced villager. I don't remember all civs having a different way to produce villager. Well, I know a civ that allowed us to produce multiple villagers at once, but in the DE, many of them got changes of each civ. That stuff added extra time to learn, the card system still exists, I know it was balanced enough. But the DE feel like we need more micromanagement, For example, native Civs that need a building to collect coins. Wow, that's kind of adding more clicks, isn't it? Different Civ, various things. I don't say the DE gameplay was shit, but for me it was sluggish and felt weird.

        [td]　
　I enjoyed AOE III's story mode the most. Unlike the previous game, which only used voice, the characters in this one have animation. I don't believe I have many criticisms of the storyline. I'm not sure. Western history was never taught in school. Even today, I don't think Majapahit existed because I've come to realize that many schools in my nation still teach out-of-date material that won't prepare students for success in real life. Here, money always makes people successful, and I had to learn that the hard way. Welcome to the modern Age!

I am utterly amazed by this. I loved the original but this is where it's at. There's some bad but mainly good to say about this. First of all they have kept all the core game mechanics the same, but the game looks stunning. It totally brings it up to par with modern RTS releases, making it a very worthwhile addition to any strategists' game library. The combat and gameplay is still as funny, vibrant and challenging as I remember it. I have a few minor critique points:

1. Political correctness
It really is not a big deal, but PC (it is of course circumstancial) bothers me at times. In this game they have renamed the natives from the original into more political correct names, for example the Iroqouis is now Haudenousaeunee (I did not misspell it on purpose but damn, what a name). I understand where they are coming from but come on, Iroqouis is how it's commonly known in English....

2. New civilizations (are great! ADD MORE!)
They have added new civs with DLCs at a reasonable price (coming from an EU4 player hahahah). I love the new civs especially Mexico, Malta and Italy, and also the Swedish added to the DE. But come on! Add some more. I have a few suggestions that I think would be really cool additions to the game:

Polish (Poland-Lithuanian Commonwealth)
Danish (Denmark-Norway / Danish Colonial Empire)
Persians (Persian Empire had many conflicts with the Ottomans)
Koreans (Well I just want more Asian factions...)
And an additional Native American faction, possibly the Cherokee or Comanche would be cool.
Additionally another African nation such as say the Songhai would be awesome! But for me I find Poland and Denmark to be the top priority given the game's setting.

PROS
+First things first, many of the cons I've previously listed in this review have been removed because the developers are constantly updating and improving the game. Major props for doing that!!!!
+At the core, this game is still a quality RTS, with all of the checkboxes to make one.
+Three different resources (Food/Wood/Coin) with a fair balance between resource acquisition and spending.
+Solid combat triangles (Infantry>Cavalry>Artillery>Infantry). Pretty reminiscent of other RTSs and Age of Empires games.
+Greater levels of variety between the factions at launch than the previous Age of Empires games (except for Age of Mythology). Instead of only having one unique Castle unit, each European faction has two (or more) unique units and a variety of factors to set them apart (e.g building a British House grants a free Settler, Russians train units in blocks instead of individually, Portuguese get a free Town Center with each age-up, etc.)
+The system for Aging Up is revamped to offer new decisions, too! Instead of merely moving to the next age, you have to pick one of a selection of options (Politicians for Europeans, Council Members for Native Americans, Wonders for Asians). Each option offers a different benefit to strengthen or incentivize different playstyles (e.g crates of 500 food that can be immediately used or two cows that, if you spend time fattening, are together worth 1000 food).
+In addition to villagers, each player starts the game with a unique character unit with special abilities (Europeans have Explorers, Native Americans have War Chiefs, Asians have Monks). These units offer a better starting unit to explore the map in the early game, and can be improved with upgrades at various buildings to make them strong units in the late game.
+Going on with the Exploration themes of the era this game takes place in, each map has a number of treasures that can be claimed by your Hero unit. These are usually guarded by neutral guardians (animals,  bandits, etc.) that must be killed (your hero will have an ability to make this easier) in order to be claimed. Once claimed, you will receive a small to moderate amount of resources, a unit (or more), or another bonus to help you in your early game.
+There are trading post sites on most maps that offer advantages. Some are next to local villages that will offer unique units and upgrades for you. Others have a trade route to grant extra resources to give you a small edge in the game.
+With the trading posts is a new Trade Monopoly victory condition. Instead of building a single Wonder and building excessive amounts of walls for ten minutes, you capture a majority of the trading posts, spend a moderate amount of resources, and hold those posts for five minutes to win. Can make for some exciting plays in multiplayer.
+Introduction of the Home City system. Each player has a deck of shipments that can be sent from their mother nation to their in-game colony that offer different bonuses, like resources, units, buildings, or upgrades. Sending a shipment a requires a player to acquire experience which can be gained through building units and buildings, killing enemy units and buildings, gathering resources, capturing trading post sites, choosing XP at a captured trade route, and taking treasures.
+Each Home City is customizable. You can have a wide array of characters like preachers, performers, and thugs walk the streets between buildings that you color! You can put your Aztec city in a solar eclipse, your Indian city in the Holi festival at sunset, or your Russian city in a cold night with a full moon!
+An incredibly functional scenario editor on par with the one from Age of Mythology!
+An excellent series of campaigns with memorable events! The base campaign (Blood, Ice, and Steel) tells the story of the fictional Black Family and their generational enemies, using it as a method to introduce the player to the aging system and the time periods that these ages coincide with!
+The expansion campaigns (Fire and Shadow and The Asian Dynasties) likewise do a great job on placing players in historical events without disrupting history! Cross the Delaware with Washington, fight Custer at Little Big Horn, help Tokugawa solidify his control over Japan, and rise up in India against the East India Company!
+Normally, I'm greatly opposed to ""fourth resources"" in games (e.g Stone in Age of Empires I and II), but the Export resource is handled excellently for the Asian factions, and the Influence resource is similar, but different in good ways for the African factions.
+The developers for the Definitive Edition added customization options to the Native American and Asian factions that weren't in the base game, so props for that!
+When remastering this for rerelease, the developers reached out to representatives of the Haudenosaunee and Lakota to ensure that their representation ingame was on point, even getting a Lakota person to rework part of the second campaign's second act (Shadow) to this end.
+Addition of two new factions in the base game: the Swedes and the Inca. Both have solid mechanics to make them stand out from the other European/Native American factions, and are fun to play in different ways!
+Also added are new Native American tribes to ally with, new outlaws to hire at your mercenary locations, and new South American maps to play on!
+Addition of Historical Battles, which are more reminiscent of the classic Age of Empires I and II campaigns, just scenarios instead of campaigns.
+Addition of The Art of War, a campaign designed to teach players how to play well on Multiplayer. It's an excellent tutorial that improved my RTS playing across the board, not just for this game!
+New different UI options that are easier to use for players used to more recent RTS games (like Company of Heroes or Dawn of War).
+DLC: New factions, including the United States, Mexico, Ethiopia, the Hausa, the Knights of St. John, and Italy!
+DLC: New African maps with the African DLC pack and Europeans with the European DLC pack! Now we just need the Middle East and Australia!

CONS
-Graphics are solidly comparable to a game from 2010 or 2012. Personally, I liked them, just don't expect Total War: Warhammer levels of fidelity.
-Unfortunately, Act 2 of the base campaign (Ice) is rather lacking, and makes exactly zero sense. Act 2 of the Asian Dynasties campaign (China) is also on the weaker side, but still worth playing.
-Getting people who speak the language to voice the Native American factions is the right call, especially for the Age of Empires series. However, some of the voices are soft or poorly acted. I understand how difficult it must be to get fluent speakers for these languages, but it's a bit jarring to go from a hero character that speaks strongly to a generic fighting unit that speaks so soft that it's hard to hear.
-Likewise, the Aztecs in the game do not speak Classical Nahuatl. As with above, I'm sure it's difficult to find people who could speak the language fluently, let alone get them into a recording studio, it's just a minor disappointment.
-DLC: The African factions are currently overpowered (free unit upgrades each Age-Up without it costing extra to Age-Up).In addition, while Influence is spent at reasonable rates, it's gained at unreasonably high rates when compared to Export (at least as of the last time I played as an African nation). Not a problem against AI, but it's a big problem in Multiplayer.

Before, I would always point to Company of Heroes II, Dawn of War 1, or Age of Mythology as my go-to for introducing players to the RTS genre. Now, I think Age of Empires III Definitive Edition is the perfect introduction for the franchise and the genre!",1639636183,1668290328,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

PREVIOUS REVIEW:
As a big AoE fan, I really want to like this game, but the fact is that despite several patches and hotfixes since release, the game is still riddled with many of the most game-breaking bugs (AI, UI, pathfinding, input, mechanics, you name it). My experience has not improved in any meaningful way since the game's release, and at this rate I don't see that changing any time soon. The new features, civs, and quality of life improvements are great, but not at the expense of stability and playability. I'm going back to the 2007 complete edition with ESOC patch. DE is not worth the frustration right now. Will revisit in the future.",1605112420,1668268193,True,0,0,0.511498212814331055,0,True,False,False

As much as I love AOE3. they have crossed the line with this one. First of all. Why does the game feel like its in pre-alpha state.. It has too many bugs and its super unoptimized. Also there's a bug where it turns the game into literal malware. Whenever you play there is a chance that  the game will crash (but not crashing 15 times a day like usual) It will delete files from your pc. People have reported lost work and 300 gb worth of files from their pc. I'd recommend staying away from the game until they address/fix the issue because even I right now am afraid to launch the game

Short their stock, do not invest, and portray them as the racist bigots they are.

No interacting with other humans apparently...
The Social interface of the game is also entirely broken, the friends list, block list, and recently played all don't work whatsoever and neither does the ranked leader board. If you do manage to get someone you want to block to show up on your recently played you can click the block button but it doesnt actually block them even if it says it did. 
why would you want to block someone? Well because for whatever reason they decided to completely change numerous cards, units, and entire civs from AoE3 2007 and in doing so created numerous truly game breaking bugs/exploits that result in 9/10 games being basically a race to broken units/upgrade cards and in most higher rated games (at least according to the broken and frozen leaderboard/ladder) 9/10 players will turtle the entire game until they get their broken card or unit and then finally push annihilating the enemy player no matter how good, bad, or prepared they are. They will try to justify this and pretend its not broken while they play with one hand and beat themselves off with the other but many of these exploits result in troops that are nearly invincible and can 1 shot all of your troops, even troops that are supposed to counter the broken units they're using. This makes for games that aren't very fun as it basically removes the entire Rock, paper, scissors mechanic that AoE is designed around. This was a problem as well back in AoE3 2007 however there were very very few truly game breaking strategies. The only that really come to mind are instant french cav and aztec water boom with 15 wood fishing boats, the exploits in this game dont even compare to those strategies. For france you had to build a strong economy and stack numerous cards to achieve the instant cav, and aztec were the strongest water civ by far but could still be beaten. Compare that to India with 20 Gurkas at age 3 that could individually 1 shot any unit (meaning it took 1 gurka 1 shot to kill any unit) even mercenaries or cav, or infinite mamalukes with 1740 hp, or Portugal with market upgrades just being able to gather 40-60% faster from all sources, or Inca being able to be inside your base with 15-20 troops before the 5 minute mark and the list goes on. 
Thankfully the Gurkas were hotfixed however i doubt they would've been hotfixed as quickly if pros werent going 42 and 0 in ranked using them however all the other broken bs i listed remains.

In summation, the game was released with broken incomplete graphics options, countless game breaking exploits and bugs that even the worst players found ways to abuse within a couple games. The Social and Multiplayer Menu's are all broken and terribly designed even if they were working as intended. Both  of the new civs are completely broken, they've removed card unlocks and kept home city cosmetic customization but added no new customization for the existing civs that did not have it before and for the new civs they created, the ranked modes broken and the ladder is frozen probably because they realized if they did not freeze it the exploiters and maphackers would build up their rating to a point where nobody would ever pass them seeing as some of these pros were using these exploits to go on 30-40 winstreaks in ranked before they froze the leader board.
11/4/22 Edit: Campaigns + historic battles probably have a good 100-200 Hours of fun gameplay in there, DLC are pretty much a waste of money as they are all pretty much designed  for the multiplayer which has not improved all that much since this initial review around launch.

For one, the game has a pretty steep learning curve as soon as you switch to hard or higher difficulties. Unlike AoE 2, AoE 3 has very specific units to each faction, so there is a lot to learn in between light and heavy, infantry, chivalry, artillery and their counterparts. Not knowing your units very well will result in you getting rushed and completely annihilated by AI within 10-15 minutes since you won't be playing properly grouped units combined with a proper deck of cards. Oh yeah, cards... unlike in original AoE 3, you don't unlock them here by grinding up your home town level - you can build the full deck with all cards available from level 1 on which makes deck building so much more accessable. Town level in AoE 3 DE is only for town cosmetics. Good one.

I still find the title ""Definitive Edition"" a bit misleading in terms of DLC content as you still have to buy extra if you want to side with the Americans, Mexicans and a few others. But let's not trick ourselves here - today's video game industry is a pile of hot garbage and whenever a chance arises to milk some extra pennies out of their customers then OF COURSE they will sell additional DLC content for a 17 years old game... if anyone's still surprised by this business behaviour then they must be hopelessly delusional or living under a rock for the last 5 years.

At a 20 bucks price tag there isn't much to argue whether the game is worth it or not. You'll get a great amount of content to play through with endless replayability in skirmish and multiplayer modes.

I will say some of the new content is really unbalanced or dull but other parts offer nice historical insight and extra content. I'm not a fan of all this cosmetic and DLC nonsense and events though. Its just really unnecessary and the game should have honestly been left alone and just updated with more cool scenarios and maps. I feel like all these new civilizations would have fit better in a new game with proper dedicated support from the start. 

My one big gripe is the game's optimization which is atrocious. There's no reason for stuttering on a 32GB 3600CL16 DDR4 system with a 11700k and a 1660Ti (parent's system). There's no reason for it on a system with 16GB 3000CL15 DDR4 system with a 9700k and 3060ti (yes I'm upgrading my system to fit my GPU in a few days from writing this). These are within spec and despite bottlenecks they should both easily hold a constant smooth 60fps at 1440p. For crying out loud a 1660 can do AC Odyssey at 60fps on high at 1080p, thats not even the Ti model. There's a lot to be said for how Age of Empires III uses your hardware.

What most impressive of the definitive edition are new-added historical battles. It would be better if more could be designed in the future. I haven't tried two new countries so far. My experience is those two countries are stronger than others, maybe need re-balanced. Another good point is that the card deck is now independent of home-city level.

This includes little changes, like the 'decolonising' of certain aspects of the game despite the fact it's a colonial game with a colonial setting, taking a fundamentally European approach to Empire and what it means to be victorious; to bigger things, like the new civilisations being locked away from you unless you pay for them; to the biggest things, namely that it is unfun to play. The AI has been designed in such a way that games can be a chore to complete, with my last match taking literally hours longer than it should've, without them ever seemingly to be playing a smart match. They can be efficient, yet completely unable to use their efficiency. The balancing of the nations is not great. There are still noticeable bugs in game, which is especially galling given how little there is to quibble with in the original in that regard.

Worst of all, neither the sound nor the graphics seem a step up from the original (which was admittedly a game with great design for the time, and still looks and sounds good even today).

All in all, despite the QoL changes that I'd have liked in the original, I can't recommend the remake in its stead.",1658768253,1666669028,False,26,0,0.553800106048583984,2,True,False,False

The bugs and gameplay issues have now been fixed. The PC police renaming is unfortunately still in the game, but there is also a lot of great new content that overshadows it.

This was my favourite game of all time. The older version had some issues with low player counts making it very difficult to play multiplayer so I was really looking forward to a new game bringing it back into popularity. I was hoping the DE would fix that, but they shit the bed in just about every aspect of the game. It's so much less reliable and buggy months after their bungled release which is the first offence but there's so much more to be disappointed by. There are major flaws present in the base game like the attack move not functioning have still not been addressed. They tried to be woke in the laziest and most offensive way. They censored every instance of the word colony and things like plantation in a game about colonialism. Their attempt to make the natives more historically accurate expended less effort than their message patting themselves on the back for it. Instead of a unique and interesting fur trade mechanic we got people loitering around an outhouse next to a mine to get their gold. Instead of replacing the fire pit with something sensible like a temple or sweat lodge, it's now a llama dance pit where villagers stand idle. 

Overall:

Pros:
They stole the maps made by fans so there are more and better balanced maps which is great.
The historical battles are really cool and what the campaign should have been in the first place.
Two new nations is nice but Inca is pretty anachronistic and there were many better choices.
Revolutionary nations have much better options even if most of them aren't too viable. 
Home city cards no longer need to be unlocked and are better balanced.
Nicer flags.

Cons:
Unbelievably buggy in multiplayer even after months for them to fix it.
Incredibly lazy revisionist history.
Major gameplay issues like attack move still not working.",1611537757,1666124538,True,0,0,0.480811923742294312,0,True,False,False

Most competitive strats are essentially a (semi)FF to get falconets. Games that run short/medium/late are typically won by the player or team that deploys more cannons. Their disproportionate efficacy against infantry is neither fun nor historically accurate. An non-upgraded falconet deals 100x3 dmg to infantry in a range and can one-shot a whole clump of skirmisher units every several seconds. Falconets for example, have a 75% dmg resist from ranged units. The intended counterplay (obviously) is culverins or heavy cavalry that can make quick work of cannons. However, because most talented players can either micro their anti-cav to defend their cannons, or position their cannons in a choke point created either from the natural terrain or walls, the only valid counter to cannons is culverins (which is an anti-cannon cannon that outranges other cannons). And so many games that run late can be won by simply spamming cannons (normal cannons combined with culverins to counter the opponents cannons), with a small amount of anti-cavalry units to defend them. Back in the olden days, many players would play ""no cannons"" multiplayer lobbies because our computers couldn't handle the lag of all the cannons and associated physics, which had the side-effect of games being more enjoyable because of the lack of cannon-spam.

It is questionable whether such a game has something to offer today's modern gamer, but Microsoft doesn't have to think much about that.

If you want to play a classic RTS, this trilogy is one of the best options. A huge amount of content, sensitive and well-thought-out changes and, on top of that, nicely polished graphics – all of this also applies to the current trio, even if it is the black sheep of the whole family. And even if I prefer to recommend you the practically perfect definitive edition of Age of Empires II, it does not change the fact that the definitive edition of the third part is a fun historical strategy with sophisticated systems and a decent portion of content.

Optimisation has improved considerably. Options allow you to reduce foliage, and thus improve visibility on many maps. Sound has been improved, with very few bad or off putting sound. AI in the campaigns are still a little off, with behaviour oscillating between challenging and dead. Pathfinding has been improved considerably, with the old stuck on tradepost bug all but gone. Naval pathfinding remains a little broken when there are many ships moving at a time.

Campaign cutscenes are remastered, but some changes are for the worse, placement of models are out of place, cut audios sound strange, its a bit of a hashed up job. The strangest thing is the Chayton Black campaign. What was once a more or less neutral story pointing out the evil and good of both the US and the Amerindians suddenly portrays only the Amerindians as good, and the US as evil. The nuance of the campaign is completely gone, Chayton's change of heart makes no sense anymore.

Destruction physics has improved, as has the music looping bug. In all, the music is still the same as the original, with no remastered tracks or new ones (except for the riffs related to the European Houses).

I can understand the changes to the Amerindian nations, and finally, the voice acting has been updated. It no longer sounds like they had the voice actors phone into the studio. Now just waiting for Akbar to stop sounding so patronising.

The homecity cards are just stacked into each other, with barely any differentiation like the old game. They did make upgrade cards more transparent though. And with new cards being added ever so often, it shakes up the meta and makes older civs more relevant relative to the new civs being added. Speaking of the new civs, they are amazing. New mechanics, new variations on maps, and interesting game modes. The only qualm I have is there are no new campaigns.

The game does look a lot better, with models having less pixelly a quality to them, the UI changes are interesting, but they do give you the option to change around based on what you are comfortable with. But even so, the UI feels very hollow, and lacks a certain personality. I don't understand why modern UI design is going into this minimalist approach, but it just feels disconnected. 

Overall, with the consistent updates adding new civs and maps, the game continues to evolve and stay relevant.

Out of nowhere they decided to do somethin about this game;
I mean the updates should have been come years years back but comes with new edition...
and comes right after age of empires 4 as well. Just focus on AOE4 updates... 
Yes adding nations and some stuff would make good old aoe3 good to play again but
problem is you released new game. and now you dont give proper updates to it...

Yea improved the game can be properly polished? yes but if they do that aoe4 will have no point i guess... 
I have no reason to play aoe3 no more other than tryin new factions i felt that way atleast.
Overall still fun with friends deff one of the best RTS game.

I paid $5.99 for the definitive edition, which includes Warchiefs and Asian Dynasties. I also purchased the United States Civilization for $2.49. I am yet to play any skirmish matches with United States Civilization. I played all the story missions including the expansions. 

I am by no means a strategy games expert. I do not play PvP. I wanted to play all the campaign missions, and because the game was on sale, I decided to take a chance. 

I am glad I did because I thoroughly enjoyed my time with the game. The main campaign missions are quite well done. The story begins during the early settlement of the new world, and goes all the way to the founding of America. There are some very interesting missions here. 

The expansions are also quite well done for the most part. The highlight of the expansions for me were the Japanese missions.There is something aesthetically pleasing about the Japanese setting. I liked the Chinese missions the least. There is nothing particularly wrong with them, I just did not find them very interesting. The Indian missions are quite good too, but the story is rather comical. They made The East India Company the cartoon villain and whether there is any truth to this, I am not sure. It did not stop me from having a decent time with the missions. 

Graphics in the game are excellent. The snow covered landscape of New England, desert canyons of the south west, tropical jungles of South America, the visuals are very striking. I do not know if this is because of HD textures that were added in the modern edition or if they always looked this good. Explosions, water effects, and physics in game are all very well done. 

In addition to excellent graphics it also works great at ultra wide resolution. I played this game at 3440x1440 resolution, and it ran perfectly fine. I also occasionally played it at 1080p in windowed mode. I was very pleased with the graphics and gameplay options. I wish all PC games implemented options like this. 

Gameplay is much the same as the previous versions. There are certain choices that focus on efficiency, which may not be well liked by veterans. I am ambivalent to this change. Logging camps and mining camps are no longer needed to collect resources.

In fact resource gathering is far more rudimentary now than it was in AOE II. There are only 3 resources to gather - food, wood and gold. Other than wood, there are infinite options for both food and gold. In Asian Dynasties, rice paddy can be used to farm food and gold. It's rather bizarre, but it's not game breaking or anything. There are some odd choices made with unit production. Indian villagers require wood instead of food. Seems rather arbitrary. 

Naval combat in this game is very underwhelming. The scale of the map does not allow for large- scale naval battles. AOE II did this a lot better. The map scale is smaller than AOE II. Certain AOE II maps are absolutely massive such as Bukhara and Dos Pilas. No such maps exist in AOE III. It's not a deal breaker, but the advance in technology did not bring us bigger, better maps. 

It took well over 60 hours for me to get through the entire campaign (including the expansions). I totally got my money’s worth. In hindsight, I should not have purchased the DLC for it. I don't see myself going back to playing skirmish matches. I am currently playing AOE2 Definitive Edition. I think overall, I enjoy AOE2 more than AOE3, but you can't go wrong for the price. 

I look forward to playing AOE I and AOE IV some day. 

For the price I paid for it, I recommend this game.

Edit: Having played more, far later on, I can confirm that they did eventually pull their thumbs out of their butts and accomplish a mostly faithful and in some places improved recreation of a beloved game. They took their time about it, though, and the launch was embarrassingly bad, so the thumbs down stays. You don't get to serve paying customers a substandard meal and then complain about bad reviews because you actually learned to cook two years later.

Irks so far:
[list][*] [strike]You want bugs? We got bugs. Unstable music volume...[/strike] - Music volume wobbling due to failtastic mastering of great music tracks into game-playable format, seems to have been fixed. Only took 'em two years or so... [strike]Broken keyboard remapping (can't bind scrolling to WASD)...[/strike] - Key binding is still a total mess to accomplish thanks to the confusing decision to bind all the letter keys to the bottom-right command icons, but you can accomplish tolerable keybinds with enough time and effort.
[*] If you want to report a bug, please go to our private web site so we can screen and, if necessary, silence you in our little corporate safe space. This is such a great idea, you guys.
[*] Weird stripes on buildings, weird paint all over privateer vessels (i.e. pirate ships, i.e. ""we don't want people knowing who just plundered their ship"")...
[*] Less visually appealing shipment cards and card picking interface... the game's unique awesome feature, made worse.
[*] [strike]Messed up visual city customization. Patriotic bunting hanging in the air ten feet out from the building it's ""attached to"".[/strike] - They actually added some new customization stuff, including nice scene/light/season changes, to the home cities of native american and asian factions. This was an unironically awesome change that gives you an excuse to play lots of skirmishes (or multiplayer, if you're utterly mad) and unlock them, along with some other neat decorative stuff. Good job there!
[*] If you have to tell each and every building to do it individually, each time, and it deactivates itself after the task has been done once, it is not ""auto-repair"". It's just repair. Just as if you have to grind the coffee by hand, it's not an automatic coffee grinder. See?
[*] Pretending colonization didn't happen is not the same as acknowledging it was wrong. It's also not a real option in a game that is literally all colonization during the historical colonial age. Also, the term ""Commercial Age"" is baloney. Every age after the invention of exchanging things for other things, is commercial.
[*] The game is still plenty insensitive to sundry tribes and ethnic groups. Ottomans, for one. But hey, hard not to be, it's a game about people killing more than half the people they meet in order to take their land (while pressing the rest into servitude). Pretty horrible when you think about it... me, I mostly just like building pretty towns. No, really, that part isn't sarcasm, that's what I'm in this for. That and revenge against attackers.[/list]

In summary: Pretty to look at, [strike]but that's about it. In its current state, not recommended. But please, by all means, change my mind, developers.[/strike] - You kind of did change my mind, developers. Nice one. Took you long enough, but yeah. I'm honestly considering buying some DLC at this point, and one could do worse than buying this - if you buy it now, long after they first sold a far more unfinished and flawed product at full price.",1602792349,1664144316,False,14,1,0.552617907524108887,4,True,False,False

--Hangups, crashes and connectivity issues in multiplayer are still often enough to be annoying.
--New civs are generally really interesting and well rounded, but tend to have balance issues. That said, the new mechanics added mix things up.

AOE3 DE offers a bunch of factions with decent to huge differences among each other, and a versatile card deck system that lets you customize your gameplay and experiment. The updated graphics are sweet and the game received a lot of stability, QOL and balance improvements. Also, entirely new and fun factions that escape the old paradigms quite a bit.

If you enjoyed the vanilla edition, definitely grab DE.
If you play AOE, definitely grab it.
If you play RTS, do it anyway.

A few issues still remaining:
- Balance can still be wonky at times, my major complaints still being on the Asian factions, and there are clear winners/losers among cards.
- At the time of writing, some old civs still need a revamp, for example France or Germany.
- In terms of UX/readability, it can be a bit robotic and hostile to new players, who need to read stuff carefully.
- Some pathfinding/LOS issues still persist.
The latter two issues probably purely depend on the fact that the game stonebed is ancient at this point.

To be fair, the remake is fine if you have a newer computer, with plenty of hard drive space, and you never liked the leveling system of the old version of the game.
But I can't in good faith recommend a game that lags this badly on a computer that played the original just fine.
The remake is a whopping 10x larger than the original too. 50 GB vs the original 5 GB. Just because computers are more powerful these days doesn't mean you need to waste all that space, and render it unusable on slower machines.
I enjoyed the leveling system of the old game and ""earning"" cards. But I can understand removing that, and I won't fault them on that alone.
But the cards have also lost their ""tree"" structure. Even though they're all available from the beginning now, they could've at least grouped related cards together, because now finding the cards I want is a pain.
The UI is a lot less intuitive than the original too, and despite having multiple options for UI, none of them match the original. Not even ""classic""

Here's a few examples of the AI lacking basic coding:

The AI will not attack you, unless by sheer badluck, that is, that its units happen to stumble upon your base, even if they do, the AI will not try to attack again, it's as if it forgot where your base was.

The AI will not defend itself in several situations. For example, an AI ship, like a fishing boat or a cavalier, won't flee or defend itself, if you attack it while it is fishing.

If you attack an AI base, the AI will only react with nearby units, but will not change its survival strategy in any way.

A quick glance at Civilization franchise's AI will prove that a better AI is possible.

I have been playing AOE III since it originally came out and I was a kid, and the Definitive Edition is all around an upgrade and just builds upon the already great foundation that was the original. After playing AOE IV for a bit I still came back to this game just because of how unique it is, with Home City shipments, customizing your home cities (limited but cool), all the unique faction units and strengths and weaknesses. This game just seems endlessly replayable. 

Pros:

- The amount of factions to choose from 
- Unique Units
- A massive selection of maps
- Well designed AI (Making playing offline just as fun as online)
- Home City Shipments (Unique only to this AOE game)
- Customizable Home City (Unique only to this AOE game)
- Gameplay is very balanced 
- Interesting Faction Strengths and Weaknesses
- Fantastic DLC Factions

Cons:

- Unit pathing can sometimes be wonky
- Villagers will sometimes go idle after chopping trees, even though there is another tree right next to them
- Walls sometimes will not connect correctly to the environment, leaving gaps in your defense

The cons are just a bit nitpicky because I honestly cannot think of any glaring major issues with the game. One thing you should know before picking this game up is that if you like Age of Empires II then you likely will not like this game. The play style and game pace is just so different, not to mention its set in a later time period. I personally love II but I love III more just because of in my opinion, the better gameplay. AOE IV is a mix of II and III so if you like IV then you may like III, either way if you are thinking about playing the game, I would say pick it up when you can because you will not have a bad experience. 

P.S. Just like with most strategy games, the campaign is lackluster, so I would not pick it up for that. It is long and tells good stories, but its simply a bit dull to play through.",1661910484,1661910484,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are several things that makes this a frustrating game to play and it feels like the company designed the game with the goal to waste as much player time as possible, instead of trying to make this a good player experience.

First, there isn't a proper guide to the different units (no database with all the stats, no tutorial). So you can't really develop any real strategies without wasting hours researching all of the basics yourself, where all it needs is for the company to release a tabulated database.

Second, you have to do a lot of random tasks to unlock explorers / home city. What is the point? The different explorers is one of the things that was supposed to be an USP of this game, and yet that is locked unless you again waste hours doing tasks that does not interest you. 

Third, the experience point system of the home city is bugged, and there are no tutorials to tell you how it works. I noticed that my home city seems to gain experience randomly, and for some home cities, there are ZERO experience points gain no matter what I do (skirmish, challenge, story, etc.). So again, you will be wasting hours trying to figure out what is wrong and how to fix it, when really all you want to do is to play a game.

This is a very badly made game. There are so many alternatives that I think are way better than this game  (the classic red alert, star craft, WoW, Sanguo series). Do you really want to waste your money on this game?",1660991675,1660991675,False,2,0,0.479939848184585571,0,True,False,False

1. the unite path finding on the map is the worst we've seen yet of any RTS and that's saying a lot. When told to engage the enemy they will walk very slowly to attack the one soldier you selected then if they're range they'll move to attack the next one or two soldiers. If they're melee units they'll actually spread out and attack the crowd after they're first kill.
2. the power balancing in the game is pretty wack like I like how complex it is but there are clearly some broken units in the game. Some of which are DLC units. Now you could argue a few of them are late game units and thus shouldn't see play a lot but since we're causal our games tend to last about an hour thus making them more common to the point they're in just about every game.

Now on the flip side there are lots of diverse unites and cultures and tactics to mess around with but at the end it's just a bit clunky and needs more time to be polished out.",1660796644,1660796644,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

More cards, balance of all the rest, more civilizations, battles, a lot of content, honestly. Didn't trust the game could be THIS good, and got fixed really soon. Honestly, unless you liked the original progression system for decks/cards, this is IT. Best AOE3 version. Limitless content and fun, goated through time and (for me) 20€ price is dope.

Right now, 19 October, game is completely BROKEN. Units stuck everywhere, like villages, cliffs, graphics glithces like resources not disappearing or popping (trees), unit upgrades that disappear from the panel sudden and randomly, specially with the chinese, so I can't even play them, cards that don't do the effect they should, or even the OPPOSITE, like slowing your unit recruitment rate. Don't even dare to speak about any political decision about historical accuracy, when the base game isn't even FINISHED! We can have those lesser debates when the game doesn't have bugs, glitches, doesn't remove your progress, crashes, disconnects you and has really bad hotkey response, because I have to press the key several times  to make them work!

The original game is almost a masterpiece in terms of playability, with fictional campaigns, very few ones although, a little unbalanced factions (in DE happens a lot with new factions and politicians), and some core changes from old ones, which I found them a MUST have nowadays.

This DE, tho, makes a lot of things right. Like more politicians, more revolutions, card balance, unit balance, new maps and old maps balances, 2 new factions and a huge player base. Is it worth it? It WOULD if it weren't broken! Get the original if this isn't fixed within a MONTH, because it will never be if so!",1603145267,1660698695,True,0,0,0.514285683631896973,0,True,False,False

When you play polished and re-released a 15 YEAR OLD GAME, you expect this; WORKING PROPERLY. But it's not working properly. In the story mode/skirmish etc. game is going crazy for no reason. Lots of people have this problem because of this, they recommend solutions in their official forum. THIS IS A 15 YEAR OLD GAME HOW ??? HOW DIDN'T YOU FIX IT GUYS ???  I have a decent pc (rtx 2070, 32gb ram, i7 processor). Even in aoe3 OFFICIAL website, RECOMMEDS YOU to lower you graphics, turn off this, turn off that. wtf ?

They are selling civilizations. And they call it DLC :D xbox game studios is not a indie game company which is trying to surivive selling dlc's.

Result:
I love aoe2-3, especially 2. I played looooong time in my childhood. And im not blaming developers. They are trying their best. They are regularly updating game, adding extra content.

Overall, I had so much fun with this one, very good game. Story is a bit childish at first, but Asian Dynasties tied the campaign nicely.

+ New mechanics, card system, home town, game is much more fluid than previous installments, UI upgrade
+ Artillery and it's audio effects, naval combat
+ You can build anywhere and there is no longer need to bring back resources to the town center
+ Game feels easier, and not so mind taxing, less town micromanagement
+ The Asian Dynasties had a nice story and atmosphere

- Audio problems, missing cutscene lines
- Childish story in first two sets of campaign
- FPS drops and minor bugs

with that said, people calling the game buggy have a point. the main campaign has been fine but recently the nathaniel black campaign has crashed every other scenario (one time towards the very end of a long one). it absolutely sucks that i have to tell people off for being racist pricks before i can name an actual issue with the game, and a major issues at that, but the current political climate is 'anyone who isn't white has to fight for the right to exist', to the detriment of the game's actual problems.",1602824980,1659181586,True,4,0,0.538949251174926758,0,True,False,False

Changing the names of the ages makes sense - if you are playing a native american tribe, having a Discovery and Colonial age are misnomers. Besides, these names barely show up anywhere and do not matter in the slightest. I can't speak to single player changes as the single player was never really relevant.

Another strange complaint are the dlc factions - the definitive edition includes all DLC originally developed from the original game. This is not just a lazy upscale of the original either, they redid many of the assets and continuously update the balance.

But now, that I have finally had the chance to delve into it, I am happy to see that it has got a similar kind of ""Definitive Edition"" care to that of its older brother ""AOEII"", including various graphical and QoL improvements, extended multiplayer support as well as new DLC updates. Unfortunately, the singleplayer campaigns are still far from great. To be fair, none of the ""AOE"" games tried extremely hard to be historically accurate, but I always found the fantasy-adjacent stories and soap opera-level dialogue of the campaigns in this one to be quite abysmal. The newly added ""Historical Battles"", on the other hand, are simply amazing and even on par with the mastery of ""AOEII"" scenario and map design.

After several updates I can finally recommend this game! 

Update 10/27/2020

The game has become malware????? Multiple reports from people saying that it is wiping out their pcs. A new installation of windows required after drive wipe.

Game crashes and freezes. 

Steam and microsoft store games are in desync as steam version was update but not MS store.



UPDATE 10/22/2020. 

The developers fixed the blurriness of the game, responsiveness and FPS issues. The game feels way more optimized at this point. I am finally able to get more than 100+ FPS with all settings turned on. 

There are still bugs in the game, however, the developers have plans to address them in the future. I can finally enjoy this beautiful masterpiece AoE III DE. 

Thank you for the update. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How can the developers mess up a game that was working perfectly to begin with?

The optimization is horrible. Even with a high end PC there is lag in game on single player???? and the game cant even get to 60 FPS with all settings off. The game seems to have a delay for everything. Even typing in chat takes like 3 to 5 seconds to post. how? why? 

The graphics seemed to have been improved a little.. It feels like I am playing with Play-DoH. 

There should have been an open beta for everyone to help test the game before release. Keeping these bugs a secret does not help anyone. This game needs support quick or it will die out faster than it took to release it. 

RANT UPDATE:

Thanks guys for the comments. I want to keep the thread alive for people and developers to see. I do not want my review to be taken in a bad manner. As an old Age of Empires player and mainly playing RTS genre, i want to support this game. I want to see this game succeed.  

This is a 15+ year old game. The COMMUNITY has kept the game alive. There is no reason for the developers to not listen to the COMMUNITY's feedback. The initial idea of the Ensemble Studios developers was to make a game that was fun. They understood the importance of historical accuracy, however, they also understood the importance of keeping the game entertaining for the players. 

See Ensemble Studios interview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n40YwG20QH8  

If there is a way to revert back the sounds, physics and textures of the units, buildings, oceans, please do so. Even if its just an option that could be turned on an off.  

In addition, dont forget the casual players that do not care for 1 vs 1 games, elo or rank matches. Even if its hard to believe, there are players out there that just want to have long, relaxing matches with friends, relatives and even play against AI. Comp stomp? anyone? 

If I forgot something, please feel free to add. 

I will update as I continue to play the game.",1602774379,1658586052,True,0,0,0.527433991432189941,9,True,False,False

The unusual timeframe where the game takes place make this unique among all RTS.

Most ""definitive edition"" of current videogames are nothing but a re-skinned hd version of their previous counterpart but not this one. It's a much improved game than his old 2005 self with more balanced civilizations, maps, general fixes and quality of life improvements. The game has been constantly update almost monthly, adding events, challenges and/or other fixes.

There are over 100 maps, 20+ civilizations, each one with their strengths and weaknesses, different gamemodes with different goals and playstyles like deathmatch, treaty, and tycoon, that are designed to satisfy all types of players.

While this game is more oriented towards multiplayer it does not forget about who likes to play mostly singleplayer.  Aside the classic skirmish there are several historical maps (special maps with unique objectives and mechanics) and 3 campaign to complete. You may also like the co-op if you want to play with friends and you're not into competition. The game is also mod friendly.

You do not need to buy any of the DLCs to enjoy the game, and unlike most modern videogames, it's not ""create a problem, sell the solution"" type of monetization. DLC simply add more content and no, the added civilizations are not ""pay-to-win"".

Most of the negative reviews are rather outdated as they refer mostly at the launch state which was mediocre as the game was clearly published in an unfinished state and sufferring of lag spikes and random crashes. After almost 2 years of fixing bugs, improving performance, adding content, most of these problems are solved and I can't think of something significantly bad to say about the game.

Whatever you are an RTS enthusiast, a chad typing GG after a loss, a virgin complaining after one, a kid at his first RTS, a history nerd, a long time AoE fan, a no-life-gamer looking to grind the ladder, a casual just wanting to have fun with his friends,  this game have something for you.",1658236274,1658349965,True,23,0,0.652457952499389648,0,True,False,False

As a history major and lover of especially war history, I can appreciate some historical accuracy, and changing the Native American nations was something I was perfectly happy with. However, at the same time, the team behind the remaster has chosen to rename the Colonial Age to the Commerce Age and the Plantation building to the Estate. These changes were completely unnecessary and do more to take away from historical accuracy than add to it. Multiple mechanics revolve around the very real colonial period in world history. Chattel Slavery and the Plantation economy were evil, but they were also a driving force behind colonial efforts and the Plantation's purpose as a cash producing farm is a perfect adaptation. Colonialism and its long reaching effects are a hot topic in our current political landscape, but to change these very real concepts while celebrating historical accuracy is dare I say, hypocritical.

Update: 7/19/22 After playing many more hours of the game and enjoying the new content for it, I have decided to change my review to a positive one.

If you're new to Age of Empires III, there has never been a better time to try it out than with the current state of the Definitive Edition. If you played and liked the original, you will like even more the Definitive Edition.

[b]Why should you read this review?[/b] I have over 3000h in the original game and I participated actively in the beta of the Definitive Edition to help shape it. I have over 1000h in Age of Empires 2, including 500h in AoE2 DE. I will try to highlight the key aspects of the game to help you make an informed decision on whether it is worth or not for you to buy.

[h1]For those new to the game but familiar with previous iterations of the franchise (for example AoE2).[/h1] The best recommendation that I can give you is to try this game with a fresh mind. This is NOT AoE2, and this is a good thing! AoE3 is much more dynamic and fast paced than AoE2 and, particularly 1v1 and 2v2 games, the lenght of the games is typically shorter and relies much less on unit spam than AoE2. Few cavalry units raiding enemy villagers can have a much more lasting impact in the game as villagers are more expensive and take longer to train than in AoE2. Military units train in batches (usually of 5), which translates into important timings and power spikes that can turn the tide of a battle if properly played. This aspect is very satisfying as, even if you're on the losing side, there is a chance that you might be able to turn the game around and win. If you're on the winning side, you know you have to pay attention and you can't just go AFK since the game can still be lost. A quick 1v1 game typically will last less than 10min, with the fastest rushes being able to win (if properly executed) at around 7-8min. Even if the game is very even, it will usually be resolved before the 40min mark. For me, this is a very positive aspect when comparing it to AoE2 (where games tend to last much longer and can drag for longer than an hour). The sense of improvement and gratification for winning comes faster here so it is a good option if you like to play more than a single game and you do not have 2h or more to spare at a time.

[h1]For those new to the game and the Age of Empires franchise.[/h1] The game comes with basic tutorial that will help you both if you're familiar and unfamiliar with the RTS genre. Additionally, the Art of War tutorials will help you learn the basics of economy and military of Age of Empires III and get you ready for the real deal: multiplayer matches (that's where the fun lies, at least for me). However, if you are more of a singleplayer type of player, do not worry! You have the original 3 campaigns remastered + historic battle scenarios + infinite amount of singleplayer games that you can play vs the improved AI.

[h1]For those who played the original AoE III and with or without its expansions.[/h1] Please do yourself a favor and buy the definitive edition. Practically every single aspect of the game has been improved. So many bugs and exploits that are still present today on the Steam version of Age of Empires 3: The Asian Dynasties have been fixed. You don't see cheating anymore, as it is practically impossible to pull off (never say impossible, who knows but I have not heard of any). Civilization balance has never been better. There are tons of new maps and several new civilizations that add freshness to the game. Graphics? Fully remastered to 4K. UI? You get 3 different layouts that you can choose from to suit your needs (Legacy, AoE2 style, and Definitive). Multiplayer? There are so many more players right now and the lobby system is robust so it's much easier to get a game started.

I bought the game during summer sale with all it's DLC for 20€. That's a total rip-off. If you're unsure please try it, even 20€ when it's not on sale will get you the base game which has plenty of content to go on. GL&HF!",1658071347,1658071464,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

On top of that, this is the only AoE title that truly feels asymmetrical. 

Instead of just upgrading your deck through levelling, those card decks got cleared of all ""useless"" cards, and now we just have various sets that allows us to have diverse gameplay style. Much better ! (And who would play an AoE title for the feeling of xp progression...).

It takes a bit of getting use to since they've changed the UI and menus around, but I like that it takes up less space on the screen so you can see more of the game. Gameplay seems smoother and feels fresh and updated. You can zoom in further and see more detail on the soldiers and buildings which is also cool! There's a setting in the menu that allows you to zoom out more than normal as well but it's still in the ""beta stage"" and gives me an fps drop when I use it. Looks like they've also got some cool DLC you can get which includes more maps and civilizations to play. The graphics in the gameplay are a bit better overall and it adds some new life to it, although a couple maps were kinda dark for me and I haven't found a brightness setting thus far. The opening cinematic however is definitely more cartoonish than in the original 2007 version, and the characters in it look clunkier. Also If you pay attention you'll see they've changed the ""destined to conquer"" line to ""destined for adventure"" which brings me to my next and biggest complaint. They've gone woke. I don't mind adventure but this game is about conquering and fighting other players. Hell they've gone so woke that they've basically tried to censor colonialism... in a game that's literally about the Colonial Ages. They've changed the ""Colonial Age"" to the ""Commerce Age"", they've changed the name of Plantations to ""Estates"" and the only reference I remember seeing to a Colonial/colony thus far is a treasure guardian that was named ""Oppressive Colonial"".     -_-     I also heard they removed a mission or two from the campaigns because they were ""offensive"" somehow, and in the Native Civs you can no longer tame a treasure guardian which was one of my favorite features about them and it's disappointing... and those are just a few of the things I've noticed so far. The wokeism alone earned this a thumbs down because I've seen so much of it ruining things nowadays. I bought the game a 2nd time though because the gameplay itself is still pretty fun and I will continue to play the definitive edition, as my 2007 version keeps crashing on me.

The pros:
[list]
[*] The new civilizations are excellent editions and really shake up how the game can be played. Not only are the civs pretty distinct from each other, but their strengths vary massively. Adds a really interesting set of possible strategies both for those playing the civs, and those playing against them
[*] The game looks fantastic. The original AoE III looked great for the time and it's aged well, but this one has polished and bloomed up the textures without making them look cartoony. Animations are solid, textures look good, and it feels like the sort of game that will age very well.
[*] They've done a great job with the UI. While you can't completely recreate the original's standard UI, you get a few options and can still get pretty close in terms of layout.
[*] The new decks have a done a great job for balancing the game right out of the gate. While I'm mainly single-player, I can see this change being hugely beneficial for multiplayer fans who are either new to this game, or just quite inexperienced. Also, a lot of changes to the civs have done a lot to streamline certain aspects (take, for instance, the ability for the British to be able to upgrade pikemen and longbowmen to Imperial without needing a special card)
[*] More and weirder maps. Just good fun, no downside here.
[/list]

The cons:
[list]
[*] I can see the look of the game turning people off. While the Aoe II remaster felt like a better done original, this one feels more like a new art style and concept for textures and it's definitely a slightly different feel and appearance to what we had before. 
[*]The new deck system does take a lot of fun out of single-player, since there isn't really any progression anymore. You still level-up, but you don't really get anything for it.
[*] If you want all of the new civs, this game is very expensive, not far off AoE IV. I'd recommend buying on-sale, otherwise I'm not sure I could justify it if you already own the original game.
[/list]

There are some things I wouldn't have changed, but overall it's a really solid revamp of what I think is a very underrated game. Strategies are more varied and out-of-the-box, some of the new maps give lots of opportunities in multiplayer team scenarios, and the game does just look and sound fantastic. If it's on sale, absolutely get it if you loved the original, or any of the other AoE games.

First things first, the optimization is lacking to say the least, however it is way better than it was at the release. 8-player games are still going to lag, sometimes even fail to sync, which will make for very unenjoyable experience. Despite the optimization issues this game is very good. Developers are pumping updates and DLCs often. Storyline is same as in original game, which is decent and worth to play throughout. Gameplay in my opinion is better than AOE II, just because there are less micromanagent and whole fights purely depends on countering units with another unit, for example: few Hanamoto samurais can wipe the floor with few dozen melee units, yet it can be easily killed be skirmirsher. Graphics are 50/50, some people say original had better, other half say DE made an improvement. In my opinion, I agree with the latter, however I also think graphics mean very little to a game like this. AOE II have horrific graphics, yet by most people it's still the superior game.

Lots of variety in gameplay and tactics by employing both cards and natives.
Although most of the time learning the units and mechanism can be overwhelming as it is quite assymettrical between factions here.

The cards can be surprising and broken sometimes, though, as military units summon would screw opposing side's placement and strategy flow. However, that can be fun sometimes as we get access to hidden techs or units we don't see in the tech tree.

I've only played the first 2 missions of the campaign (more on this in a bit), and skirmish plays much like the original. So I'll keep this review focused on the remaster.

Some things got renamed, most notably, ""Plantations"" became ""Estates"". Aside from the indigenous civilizations which I haven't played yet, this is a cosmetic change. You build it, it does what the old building did, Bob's your uncle. The ""Cowboys and Indians"" feel of the old Warchiefs expansion was, I felt, one of its weaknesses, but then, it expanded on a fictional story, so I dismissed it. If this remaster portrayed the indigenous cultures of the time more accurately, I think that's a win.

In the original, if you played skirmish mode, you had to earn your cards. In this remake, they just give you everything, and the only place you earn cards is in the campaign. I think it would've been a lot better if you had the full deck in multiplayer, but you were forced to earn the cards in single-player skirmish. I just feel there was better challenge in having to face your opponents with the best card set you could come up with from an incomplete deck. Perhaps they didn't have time to set up the card level requirements for all the new civilizations because that would mean months of balancing and playtesting.

Speaking of new civilizations, you get all the civs from the original plus expansions, plus some others available as DLC, like a United States civilization that isn't a revolution offshoot of the British. That's right, you can play all 5 ages of badass freedom without being stuck with militia, crappy gatling guns, and maybe rockets if you remembered to build factories, for a small price. You can play Mexico, Italy (Naples), Ethiopia, Malta, and more. Initially I didn't agree with making these paid DLC, but then, I did pay good money for both expansions when they were released, so eh, whatever. There's new variations on old gameplay-- the US civ adds states rather than politicians as you age up, each of which add unique cards. This is incredibly powerful, and yet, you need to have a steady supply of experience to really take advantage of it.

I don't know if there's a US Civil War scenario or anything like the Napoleonic or Crimean Wars or the Boshin War in Japan, but if modding is a thing, these are a few things an enterprising modder can come up with.

My main gripe with this game is, its copy protection apparently doesn't like SteamOS or Proton and locked me out of the game during the campaign until I restarted. This is completely vanilla, nothing but DLCs, so good job, Microsoft, you've demonstrated yet again why locking software down only hurts the honest users.

Also, the Japanese civ uses the original non-native voice actors. I'd hoped they used the voice audio from the Japanese version which was far better, but alas, I have to listen to barely-fluent Japanese with a heavy accent.",1655713817,1655714122,True,3,0,0.498169928789138794,0,True,False,False

The constant updates and support through the DLC, Monthly Events and patches have been turning this game in the best version of itself. Although, there is still even more room for improvement, specially when it comes to the representation of more regions and cultures like South Asia and the rest of Africa. This is the way and hopefully the devs have more surprises in stock for us.

If you liked the Legacy version, go ahead. You have lots of new content including new civilizations, new maps, game modes, even a photo mode. This product have something to offer whether if you are a single player lover or a multiplayer enjoyer.

We're missing a full fleshed out campaign like in the originals, despite we have some short story Historical Battles, hopefully we will get a full campaign/s in the future. In the other hand, modding has become easier but we're still lacking big mods as used to be in Legacy but as former modder of the old version I have no doubt great mods might be coming forward.

If AOE 2 is the perfect example of a well executed, classic RTS experience, AOE 3 tries to differenciate itself. Units use damage multipliers instead of static damage bonuses against their counters (and sometimes deal less damage in general against units they're bad against, such as Crossbowmen doing less damage to Cavalry that counter them), villagers instantly depositing what they gather into your stockpile instead of needing drop off points like lumber camps - a big change that incentivizes the player to go out and hog the map early instead of just focusing on your base's immediate surroundings, since going out to hunt animals is much better than farming food. A separate interface that lets you ship over units, resource and upgrades from your home country, which greatly affects your strategy and playstyle - for example, you can ship over extra units to help in a rush or to defend yourself, or ship wood to build a bunch of buildings quickly, or send over upgrades to make certain units stronger - there's a ton of variety and unorthodox choices for you to try, which also goes a long way to make civilizations stand out and be unique amongst themselves (for instance, the Dutch make their villagers with Coin, not Food. Spanish ship stuff super fast, Maltese can work better next to defensive buildings). Some civilizations are really good at shipping over units and be aggressive, while others have more economy-focused cards to choose from. Aging up is spicy too, as when you age up, you choose what bonus you want to go with your aging up, such as units, buildings or resources.

I love the game, and I think it deserves to be credited as a great spin on RTS fundamentals. I also believe it's quite a lot easier to play and get into than AOE 2, for such reasons as villagers not needing drop offs, units generally being tankier and more forgiving to use and shipments compensating for whatever problem you're facing at a given situation.",1655025028,1655025028,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Let us name our canine companions on top of our explorers. My explorer is named ""Naughtius Maximus"", but lately he has been feeling a little depressed because he has been torn asunder from his canine companion from the original AOE3 game I had. His dog's name was ""Naughty Boy"". 

I see Sir Maximus walking across the map (it's more like a depressive saunter), constantly letting himself get killed by treasure guardians or the enemy. When he dies, he just sits there. ""Every moment I live is agony"" he says to himself. It's because no matter how far he searches the map, Naughty Boy is no where to be found.

Naughtius, you don't have to be so reckless. Why do you punish yourself so?

Alas, his dog is gone. Now all Naughtius is left with his dog's final thoughts: ""Horatio, I am dead; Thou livest; report me and my cause aright To the unsatisfied.""

I grew up playing age 3 it was my game as a kid. played the crap out of age 3 and what made me obsessed with history and wanting to learn more. What made age 3 so amazing was its culture and its history and the missions and the stories and the game play. the devs just destroyed that. everything is washed down SJW crap. the fact that you get a message when you first download and play this game saying the original game was basically racist and a mistake so here lets make this remaster basically a love letter to whinny losers. the balancing sucks the new civs are boring at best. the incas are apparently OP for some odd reason what happened to guns? another problem is the fact the renaming of ages and names of troops and buildings. the time period had plantations yes plantations not estates. this was a time of historical colonialism sorry that is just a fact  of life. the devs trying to erase that is dangerous and backward thinking. you can be sorry for the past but still respect history and portray it the way it happened not what you feel is the better option that is sad... there was the bad and the good and the bad again in the 1700s and before, but that is what this game pis set in so pay homage and respect the time period. i understand you want to pay better homage to the local tribes in this game or better representations, but they were not always the victims when in the story missions you have to basically be forced to act like the Indians are just the saints and white man evil is such an embarrassment. both sides sinned its a part of life and we are all humans. so instead of sucking off people and making sure its a PG remaster of the OG age 3 2007 version and allow what made age 3 so good and just doing what they did with age 2 remaster, they decided to make backwards progress. by far the most waste of money. i was so excited at first this was the game that defined my passions of history and learning why certain historical events happened. i am glad i am educated enough to know this is not doing an good service to anyone and its a real shame. do not waste your time. if you are a real fan of age 3 you will not like it. 

In the end, i wish i had a refund this game is a pile of crap. go play the original age 3 there is no age 3 remaster never heard of it.

Edit: The game has improved and I enjoy it now, but I will stay true to what i said already and still say The PC culture is still annoying and the game is a massive memory dump. If they just did not change so much of the OG game i would finally give this a thumbs up but nope. it still feels like a different game of its own and that is not a bad thing but it is not homage to the original age 3",1613422824,1653985187,False,399,16,0.75743633508682251,0,True,False,False

While they are a bit more pricey for what they offer(e.g. historical battles instead of actual campaigns), I appreciate the devs continuous updates.[/h1]

I have played thousands of hours of AOE 1, 2, 3 including AOE 2 competitive. I am only mentioning this to put in some context about my background with this game and where I am coming from. 

[b]TLDR: Horrible UI, terrible AI, single player got gutted, I am disappointed, 2007 version is better than this version(except in some aspects of graphics)[/b]

[h2]Positive[/h2]
* The cinematic graphics and the particle physics are the biggest improvement. How a burning building falls or how a burning ship sinks looks pretty good.
* 2 new civs (AOE 2 DE offered so much more though)
[b] And that's about it. [/b]

[h2]Negative[/h2]
* There is no more progression in single player. I miss seeing the xp numbers when I kill a unit or destroy a building. I liked the way you could unlock different cards slowly. They could have made a progression system for single player and everything unlocked in multiplayer. Also, I do not think this game will ever become as big as aoe 2 in the multiplayer space for many different reasons. The strength of this game was the single player progression and they gutted it.
* The UI is terrible. I played two games in Himalayas and Deccan(About 75 minutes); it strained my eyes. And I am used to playing 6-7 hours of back to back competitive aoe 2 games. Everything seemed a bit darker, dull and it was hard to discern some colors. It's harder to discern treasures and treasure guardians compared to the 2007 game. The way score is shown is obstructive- it blocks too much of the screen if there are 8 players. Also, it doesn't crosses of the name of a player if they resign.
* The AI still stays in the island and doesn't know what to do
* There are a lot of other pet peeves of mine(e.g. Colonial age -> Commerce Age, native american gold mining and treasure guardian conversion etc)

<rant>This game had a lot of potential. But it seems like this game doesn't know what it wants to be. It doesn't have the cache of civilizations or the  game balance(Good luck fighting against a frigate or iron clad with some war canoe) and dynamics that aoe 2 have to have a vibrant multiplayer; yet it wants to cater to that space and gutted the progression. It got some home cities to give you a sense of customization; yet in reality it's laughable in 2020. The AI tries to be taunting or encouraging like Sid Meir's Civilizations, but has a very limited amount of response. By trying to be so many things, this game fails to have its own unique identity and by not excelling at any single aspect it lacks the element that would attract players to have a 3rd, 4th or nth game. I was so excited to play this game. But after playing for only 20 minutes, I started to miss the 2007 version. At this point, I doubt that I will even cross 20 hours in this game.</rant>

It is also a lot more polished than Age IV in my opinion, and has improved a lot in the bugs/quality of life department from the DE release a couple years ago.

///
[Old review, weeks after the release:] Might give a thumbs-up after some updates, as it's a proper game in its core, but it's literally... LITERALLY unplayable in multiplayer at the moment.

Main impression:
+ Love the 2 new civ(s), especially the Inca
+ Graphic artists made a pretty nice job improving the graphics

- Horrible AI pathfinding & coding
- Much worse performance than the old AoE3
- Layout/HUD is so buggy & clunky, you can't properly click unit cards or even browser search fields at times

10/10, would love to watch an image gallery of a multiplayer skirmish again.

But AoE3 is REALLY freaking fun.

I love the card system, which effectively allows you to customize your playstyle and build to the kinds of things you enjoy in a game. I especially enjoy that you can have different decks that specialize you in different ways. So if for example you're playing a team game in the pocket, you can build KILLER econ. If you're on an edge defending, you can build for a turtle style, or hyperfocus one of your military units.

I love that each civilization feels unique with multiple unique units, and different core mechanics for basic things like villager construction or age advancement. This is a major draw for me, actually, over AoE2, where most of the civs have a sort of subtractive design (there's the big tech tree that everyone shares and each civ is restricted to only certain parts of it; their flavor is defined entirely by civ bonuses and their single unique unit/tech). The only sameyness I felt in AoE3 was between the different European civs.

I love the experience system and how controlling trade routes is really important. It gives an important objective and a reason to keep moving out on the map to expand and defend.

I love that there's only three primary resources instead of four. Stone always felt a bit extraneous in AoE2.

I love the DE's options to change up the UI, and the other quality-of-life features.

TL;DR: AoE3 is a ton of fun as a casual customizable RTS, and it plays best in that spirit, I think!",1644813544,1653291558,True,4,0,0.569536387920379639,0,True,False,False

While they have added tons of new maps and scenarios it's no fun if my top of the line computer can't run it without the game randomly crashing, which is a shame because I like the new civilizations and content. I like that they added up to 4 teams as an option, I like that they allowed multiples of the same civ in single player skirmish mode and I loved that you can change the colors of civilizations to whatever you want through the accessibility section of the options menu. A great game is under all of this but until the game stays stable and doesn't crash it's not worth it. Unless you are really impatient I recommend you wait for a couple of months, the game is good but it is NOT in a playable state. 

This is a soft NOT RECOMMENDED

EDIT: 10/23/2020

I have more perspective after some time. The crashing is very frequent. I still like to play the game but there are a ton of problems. This is not a release of a complete game. This is a glorified open beta. Only get the game if you are ok with Early Access games.


EDIT: 11/8/2020

The devs are extremely pathetic and I'm getting tired of their shit. They added a patch which deselects your villagers when they build buildings and deselects your units if they use an ability. Games are still crashing and it's obvious the devs are in way over their heads. Even a month after release this game still has months of work ahead of it before it's as stable as the first game.

Still crashing into April. Game would be great if it didn't crash all the time. There is a good game here. It unfortunately crashes to desktop or completely crashes computer and requires a restart for 50% of days. 

After underclocking my PC the computer stopped crashing while playing this game. The game is now not torture to play. I didn't have to do this to help with any other game however so it's something going wrong with this game. It still crashes randomly but the amount of crashes are much reduced now and I finish most games.

Gameplay wise id say its a bit less eco-micro heavy than the predecessor and offers great faction to faction variety, especially for civilisations of different ""add-ons"" or faction DLCs, but also the ""standart"" european faction have quite big play differences.
I can see how the unlocked cards in the DE can be a bit detromental to players in their gameplay progression experience, but personally I think it allows for a better mp experience, and less requirements for grinding, especially if you want to try arround with the factions as also the cards vary quite a bit how you would play a faction, so having them unlock them especially on the higher levels was quite a hassle back than, if you need like 20 hours per faction to unlock its potential.
Additionally you get a quite regular update service, though on longer games you can still experience some Network instability.

Generally id say its a worthwhile RTS game, which is a bit more accessable than AoE 2 and offers great gameplay variety, but also competetive optimization options.",1603156129,1652608595,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

don't get me wrong, i absolutely loved the original AOE3, one of my earliest PC gaming memories was begging for the asian dynasties DLC when i was 8 years old, but this remaster seems to do more things wrong than right and tarnishes some of my memories of the original

pros:

-new factions are interesting [especially now that there's 3 (soon to be 4) new DLC packs, adding a total of 8 new factions not in the original game]
-graphics are a nice upgrade [somehow even better with photo mode added]
-integration with xbox live is pretty nice
-price is cheaper than the original
-having all cards from the beginning for multiplayer [can see as to why hardcore players hate this]
-some historical accuracy changes are cool, such as the updating of flags and name changes to things such as a plantation, the sioux and iroquois, even if it is kind of lazily implemented in some areas

cons:

-campaign is totally broken, don't expect to be able to complete it without using some cheats as cutscenes freeze, units will get stuck in terrain making them unusable and some mission objectives don't actually work, forcing you to advance to the next level using commands [very rarely get these issues now]
-too many crashes when doing basic things in skirmish, such as using samurai to attack arsenals which has crashed me 3 times [happy to report you can use your samurai to destroy as many arsenals as you want!]
-having all cards unlocked makes single-player pointless, as you have no end goal and no budget decks to use, good for multiplayer as i stated earlier since it eliminates grinding and allows you to be more strategic with friends, but makes single-player skirmishes pretty one-sided
-changing the names of the first two ages, this change is so stupid to me as they're trying to erase an age of colonialism in a game about colonialism
-straight up changing the warchief abilities for the native american factions, alongside changing their method of collecting coin, i understand they want to promote historical accuracy, but this changes the actual gameplay of the game which i dislike quite a lot
-the graphics are nice as described earlier, but they're way too blurry and this is apparent in cutscenes or if you zoom really close in, not the 4k graphics we were promised
-the total rearrangement of the UI was completely unneeded and the fact we can't revert it to exactly as it was in the original AOE3 adds further insult to injury [should still be an option to rearrange but it's much, much better in hindsight]

overall, i still love this game regardless of how unfaithful to the original and buggy of a remaster this is, but i'd really wait until the bugs and glitches are ironed out a bit more before you purchase it, i really hoped i could give this the most glowing review possible but until some major changes are made, i just can't recommend anyone buy this in its current state. some good updates have made the game more stable but most of the listed issues still persist, such as units being stuck in buildings and general multiplayer instability",1602960573,1652385239,True,0,0,0.478087663650512695,0,True,False,False

In the Definitive Edition, in addition to the 2007 version of the client, you will receive:
-Free, full Shipment Decks (No unlocks required)
-The United States civilization (A turtle, Artillery/Infantry civ)
-Asian Dynasty DLC

Age of Empires III offers a much more streamlined economic toil compared to its predecessor. You will not find yourself annoyed with certainties like limited gold/stone resources, renewing farms, and villagers will no longer need to return to a gather point with their resources. These alone make AOE III drastically more accessible.

I think one of the signature features of AOE2 was the constant feeling of impending doom -- at any moment hordes of enemy units would appear on the horizon, ready to obliterate your painstakingly built settlement.

AoE III: DE is a remaster of the 2005 Age of Empires III. As a RTS game, it brings some unique features such as build limits and the “home city” concept. The gameplay is rather mediocre. Killing units isn’t as satisfying as slaughtering Zerglings in StarCraft II. Overall, the game feels slow compared to more modern RTS games. The game comes with nine campaigns as well as multiple missions based on historical battles.

I’m giving it a thumbs up for the vast amount of SP content included with the game. Get the game if you’re looking for a RTS that covers the Age of Discovery. It’s also commendable for featuring India and various Native American cultures.

With a much needed graphical overhaul and better cut-scenes the game delivers what it has been generally advertised as: a remaster. Fans of the older title will find that certain features have been completely removed (the old ESO framework), balanced (it is no longer necessary to grind the City Cards thus making the game more friendly towards the casual players), re-branded (the European term Iroquois has been changed to the native  Haudenosaunee and the more broad term Sioux to the more specific Lakota; the gold-producing building for the Europeans has been changed from Plantation to Estate and the Age of Colonialism to the Age of Commerce) or introduced for the first time (colour change, more Revolutionary States, the addition of the Swedes and the Inca)

Regarding the re-branding there have been many comments and reviews already but I still feel that a small mention should be made. The fact that the old Plantations are now called Estates is still correct (if not more), historically speaking since the landowners would have referred to them as such. Secondly, the fact that it was Colonialism and now it is Commerce is a way of shedding the old Victorian view (much of which the whole Western World has about this period). Everybody is free to disagree but making a choice based only on these two aspects I believe is a mistake.

All in all it is a title which is well-worth the money due to the enhanced graphics, high quality sound, and even if you play only the campaign it will be sufficient to justify the purchase.

Nevertheless, it's a shame the game got released so unfinished. But this seems to be common practice nowadays...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[b]TLDR[/b]: The game got released too early and at the time of writing is a buggy mess. Wait till they have fixed everything.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[b]Full review[/b]:

Looks like Forgotten Empires learned nothing from their previous releases (AoE 1 + 2 DE). Both were buggy and unfinished at release. While AoE 2 could be saved since it's been pretty popular all along, AoE 1 pretty much died due to still remaining problems up until today (poor performance, horrible pathfinding).

For AoE 3 DE they do the same mistakes again. The release feels rushed since the game is a buggy mess and some features are completely missing. I participated in the closed beta (April), in the MP stress test (September) as well as in the preview event (October), reported many bugs and missing features and so did a lot of other people. To my surprise, many bugs reported in the closed beta (April) were still there in the MP stress test (September). A lot of requested features during the MP stress test are still missing today. 

Here are a number of issues currently ingame:

[list]
[*] Poor [b]optimization for widescreens[/b]: The main menu looks weird and unfinished. All the cut scenes are 16:9. The home cities were not adjusted to widescreens and you will find big bars on both sides when you enter the city. 
[*] The new cities can't be [b]customized[/b]. Though I really do not care about this, this is just another sign of ""Oh shit, we're running out of time!""
[*] The [b]multiplayer menu[/b] is not very intuitive. When in lobby browser, you won't find a ""create lobby"" button. Rather you will have to go back and click somewhere else.
[*] No [b]unlocks in MP[/b]: This really lowers the longtime motivation. At least in AoE2 DE, you can unlock profile pictures. Also take notes from SC2.
[*] Obvious [b]balance issues[/b], some which are new (new civs), some are old and been known since 2007: French cuirassiers.
[*] The [b]AI[/b] is dumb as a bucket of water. The campaign is a joke, even on hardest difficulty.
[*] You don't really notice when somebody [b]resigns[/b] because the sound it plays is really low and sounds rather trivial.
[*] [b]Ship destruction physics[/b] got pretty much completely removed
[*] Units get [b]stuck[/b] on high terrain and in buildings
[*] Poor [b]performance[/b], never over 60 FPS. Though it's usually well above 30 and not as horrible as AoE 1 and 2 were at release (or still are).
[*] Blunt and boring [b]achievements[/b]. Why do I care about achievements? Because they add a certain replayability and challenge to the game.
[*] [b]Unnecessary changes[/b] no player asked for: renaming some natives and ages.
[*] No [b]new campaigns[/b] for the new civs. Again this feels like the devs rushed the game or just didn't care enough to add some.
[/list]

And these are the only issues I come up with right now. As you can see the list is long and goes on and on. Most of these issues, like the resign sound, are easily fixable in a matter of days/weeks. Now you see why I think this game should've been delayed.

Of course there are also a lot of positive aspects like the graphics, the UI, historical battles and an almost lag-free MP (at least in beta). Too bad the game overall still feels like a beta.",1602785162,1650787961,True,0,0,0.784482240676879883,15,True,False,False

The game had issues at launch, but I can happily say that the developers have worked incredibly hard to fix all the major gameplay issues. Performance is good, AI is good, gameplay itself is fun and engaging, and we are getting constant updates. 





AoE III. My childhood. I was so excited when the Definitive Edition was announced. But in the current state of the game, it's inferior to the original.

I don't understand the change of Native American civilizations. The Iroquois were supposed to represent the Iroquois confederation, and I see nothing offensive in using a name people can *actually* somewhat pronounce. You put so much effort into making native civilizations historically accurate, despite the fact that NONE of the European civilizations are historically accurate. You have Napoleon fighting Ivan the Terrible for crying out loud. But it doesn't matter now does it, since Europeans aren't minorities. 

Now to actual gameplay. 
I've only played a couple of games I must admit, but I can only pinpoint a few negatives. 

The AI: It's acting very... weirdly. In Age II it was building houses very close to my town center for no apparent reason, also sending settlers to resources very close to my base. It didn't built any trading posts and it didn't seem to build up as much. Multiple smaller raids, all easy to kill off, something very different from what I'm used with classic AoE. It's armies also seem to protect their villagers a lot more, which is good I guess?

The UI: Oh God. It's a mess. I appreciate trying to simplify it somewhat, but the classic UI is a nightmare to use. all sort of extra buttons, the health bar is WAY too small, and other frustrating tiny things. I appreciate the further zoom though. 

Gameplay and balancing: I've only played European civs, and everything mostly feels the same. One thing I am greatly saddened by is the elimination of the home city XP system. It was a very fun thing to grind in SP, bit unfair in the MP but I hope they'll adjust this soon. One bug I experienced is that after advancing to Age IV, my town center disappeared. I have no clue why, it didn't get deleted, still showed on the minimap, and received shipments there, but I could not select it.

Graphics: They're better. Can't complain. Except Lizzie. What have you done to my poor Lizzie, she looks like some crappy devianart character.

Overall I am disappointed. I hope the devs will listen to the community and fix some critical issues.",1602802992,1650496096,True,0,0,0.519008159637451172,0,True,False,False

Absolutely terrible. Forget how gimmicky the card system is, even if you had amnesia and forgot the previous AOEs existed, as a basic RTS it fails: 
* Bounding boxes for unis don't correlate to models, so when you click on what you think unit A is, unit B responds
* Ships don't have stances, so you can't tell them to stay put in one place. They automatically chase anything. So to kill a ducking cow they go head first into an area full of castles or towers. Smart -_-
* Keyboard shortcuts missing or inconsistent: some are lower case in the HUD. Did you ever notice that l and i are very similar? This is why they SHOULD ALWAYS BE UPPERCASE (just to make sure you know the difference...)
* Some actions cannot be queued and some can, very arbitrary.

What's more, I didn't even really get into the game until two months ago (that'd be, February 2022). The reason for that is quite simple: AoE III changed a lot of things from the ""original"" experience I liked from the first two games, and thus, it was kinda hard getting used to it. However, after putting a little over a hundred hours, I must say I enjoyed the game.

So, what is Age of Empires III? Well, while I said it changes things from the previous games, at its core, it's still an Age of Empires game, that is, a RTS set during a specific historical period, which allows you to play as several different civilizations from the era. In this case, the game followed the historical progression of the franchise: the first game focused on Ancient History, the second game was centered on the Middle Ages and early colonialism, and this game covers a timeframe going from early colonialism to the industrial revolution; I'd say it's just shy of falling into World War I territory. Honestly, I'd say it's kinda a shame that for Age of Empires IV they decided to go back to the Medieval period of history; while it's certainly one of my favourite historical periods, I'd have loved to see and Age IV focusing on the World Wars. Anyway, I digress, back to the review!

The core gameplay in this game is shaken up quite a bit. While you still gather resources, advance in age gaining access to more powerful buildings and units and such, a brand new mechanic is the shipment system. Since you play as a colonial power, you get access to shipments from your home country; these work as cards you can activate during the game, which provide different bonuses, give you a couple of units upon their arrival, or other benefits. Before playing a game, you can build ""decks"" from the different shipment cards you have available. Once in game, you earn experience for stuff like constructing certain buildings or killing enemy units, and this, in turn, grants you shipments. A really interesting mechanic, as the shipments can help you turn the tide of battle if you send them at the right time.

Another big change is that, in this game, there's five different ages instead of four, with the first age, the aptly named Exploration Age, being focused in exploration. Whenever you start a game, you get an explorer unit alongside your starting villagers. What differentiates this explorer from the starting scout you'd get in a game like Age of Empires II, is that it's more of a ""hero"" unit, with regenerating health (while idle) and special abilities. This explorer is a really important unit, as, scattered around the map, there are several treasures that can provide you extra resources or other bonuses. The explorer himself cannot die, if his health ever reaches zero, they fall to the ground and slowly start regenerating their HP; you can send an unit to revive them, or pay a ransom to recover them.

Other gameplay changes include the fact that different regions get different mechanics, and even civs from the same region might have their differences. What I mean with this is that, for example, European powers would be the ones that most closely resemble classic AoE games in their gameplay: villagers gather resources, you age up through the town center when getting enough resources, and so on. Meanwhile, Native American civs, while playing somewhat similar to the European powers, get a special ""Community Plaza"" building that, when being worked on by villagers, provides different bonuses to training time, combat strenght, and so on. Finally, we have the Asian powers, which don't age up in the ""traditional"" way, rather, you have to build wonders in order to age up (in a sense, this is similar to how aging up works in Age of Empires IV, at least during the beta). As for the DLC civs, I'll talk about them in their respective reviews.

Damn, I've written a lot, and I've only talked about gameplay! Haven't even mentioned stuff like graphics and such. Well, I did say it had plenty of changes in regards to gameplay. So, when it comes to graphics, I must say I haven't played the original, so I can't really say how they compare, but personally, I liked the way the game looks. However, I will recognize that, at times, the amount of details makes it hard to see the units in the map.

Something I was forgetting to mention was the singleplayer content, which is what interests me the most (I barely touched MP). In this regard, I must say I was slightly disappointed to learn that the campaigns were fictional stories set during the period represented in the game. The very first campaign has many fantastical elements, and while it's a fun campaign, something you'd expect from a swashbuckler film, having more historical stuff would've been nice. Of course, it seems that during the game's ""original run"", so to speak, the devs must've realized this. While the second campaign, from the Warchiefs expansion, seemed to tone down the fantasy elements, the final campaign, The Asian Dynasties, took a more historical approach (though with some big creative liberties in some parts). Luckily enough, by the time they made the Definitive Edition, the devs were nice enough to add a couple of Historical Battles, and they're a nice way to learn a few things from the period. Also, while they're described as ""Co-Op Historical Battles"", they can still be played solo. And once you're done with the campaign, you can go to Skirmish mode, or even play MP if that's what you like.

Phew, honestly, I'm surprised this review has gone on to be so long. I honestly didn't know what to write when I started it, and now I feel there's a lot of stuff that I'm forgetting. Like mentioning the soundtrack, for example, which is great. Or the customization options, as the Home City of whichever civ you last used in Skirmish mode gets displayed on the main menu. Anyway, I must say that, after my 100+ hours in this game, I enjoyed it, so I can recommend it for any RTS fan out there.",1650177378,1650177378,True,32,0,0.766176283359527588,2,True,False,False

I love the original and the 2nd one to death but not needing resource drop off points was one of the biggest improvements to this series.  More focus on tactics and battle and less on economy.  This isn't to say you can ignore economy, build orders and resources are definitely important but less so than previously.

I think they did a fantastic job at the remaster and adding in new civs.  That being said, some of the new civs are way to gimicky and complex.  I play to relax as the older I get the slower I get.  For me, the USA and other civs have too much RNG for what you may get and the build orders are so strict that it isn't fun, at least for me.  If that's your thing, then this is right up your alley.  

Overall, RTS these days are often drowned out due to the Gen Z desire for the next Call of Duty 800,000 or Battlefield 9,000,000.

My issue is that there apparently is a blatant concern for being politically correct in a game that transpires in an extremely politically incorrect era - just like all historical games.

I can't recommend this version of the game for one single reason. The new devs got blackout drunk, beat each other in the head with bats, then decided to do some programming while drunk and concussed. It's the only explanation for why they completely ruined the one thing that made this game different to other RTS games.

The Shipment system. Playing Skirmish maps to level up Cities and unlock better Cards made Skimish maps have a point to them. It meant that playing Skirmish meant something. For some reason the devs decided to insert their heads into their rears and scrapped that. This version of the game has all cards unlocked right away. There's no point in leveling up your city because you don't need to unlock Cards. Now it's just another generic RTS like all the others.

They should have left the Card system alone. At the very least it should be an option to toggle on/off in the Settings. I played this game a LOT.

Since its original release this game has received a ton of quality of life fixes that really help the game function on a micro/macro level. The display of gather rates, the ability to zoom out super far, and updated hotkeys really help this game fly.
There is a decent amount of DLC content for this game as well! Though I think its a bit over-priced. That being said, each additional civilization on top of the base game's Asian, Native American, and European civs are all quite fun and play pretty differently from each other.

Note: I play almost only multiplayer skirmish against bots (with friends).


- Pathing is bad especially for groups of ships and big groups of military units
- Multiplayer games have at least 30% chance that one of the players has a game crash (the good thing is that AoE creates a savegame which you can load and rehost the game. But loading this 10MB file takes 5 minutes, WHAT THE HELL?)
- bad support for hosting games without AoE network (you can host a game in your local network, but they prevent you to connect to a different network (e.g. public IP), There is no options to connect by IP.
- bad performance optimization for higher unit counts like 5 players at near max unit count (my system: Ryzen 5900x and RX 6900 XT)


In the beginning, all those possibilities like the card system fell overwhelming (and some of the cards are really badly explained), but after some games and some research, this actually allows you to adjust your cards to fit your playstyle.

This entire game started out by exploring the age of exploration and colonialism, an aspect these new developers are removing from the game (if you remove the focal point of the game, WHATS THE POINT OF THE FREAKING GAME THEN!?)

But the COMPLETE retcon of the Shadow campaign sealed it for me. 

The only good thing to come out of this was the Swedes, but they alone aren't worth the rest of this mess. Don't know what the devs were thinking. Must've been on something

Don't even get me started on the blatant disrespect they gave the US by referring to it as a ""melting pot"". For hell's sake, the male villager isn't even white, but American settlers were VERY CLEARLY white. They were also high end puritans. Modern day ""progressive values"" of America dont belong in the colonial ages. Get your modern day SJW crap out of our community

Are the developers switched out for some SJW freaks? Get NORMAL people in your team and ONLY normal people. If they have a rainbow flag, or support any kind of dumb idea of ""diversity and gaming for all"" FIRE them, they dont belong in our community. Please dont make me take this further up

As your home nation leveled up, you can unlock cards that show progress, similiar to how nations progressed through time.

Age of Empires III DE is a classic real-time strategy and that is just great. The idea of getting experience in order to get shipments from hometown is an idea I loved first time I played the game and still enjoy it. The campaign is also enjoyable and even interested me enough to finish it, which is more than I could say about campaigns in previous installments. Overall I would say that AoE III DE has everything a good RTS game should have.

[h1] The Bad [/h1]

Age of Empires III DE has much to offer while also lacking some features from previous installments which would enhance the game experience in my opinion. When I focus on what is missing, first it is setting [b]maximum population limit[/b] for the game, but I see that the limit (200-220) is necessary because the game is [b]poorly optimized and would not handle higher numbers.[/b] 

Another thing I'm missing is possibility to set difficulty for each AI separately. There are quite bug jumps between moderate, hard and hardest difficulties so it would be nice to have an option to mix them. And the most annoying missing feature is a possibility to play LAN locally - [b]now you have to play LAN games on online servers[/b] even though me and my wife, whom I play with, sit next to each other and because of this the game sometimes goes out of sync or just lags because of connectivity problems. 

Last thing I'm missing is from the original game (not DE) - it is an option to get experience for each civilization and unlock new home shipment possibilities for you. Now you start with everything unlocked which makes sense for competitive online playing, but they took away the possibility of making a progress in the skirmish game, and it was one of the things I loved in the original. 

[h1] Summary [/h1]

[b]Pros[/b]

✪ [i]Hometown shipments[/i] 
✪ [i]Explorers[/i] - adding Heroes to the game works good
✪ [i]Enjoyable campaigns[/i] 
✪ [i]Great graphics[/i] 
✪ [i]Easy to learn, hard to master[/i] 
✪ [i]Quick paced game[/i] 
✪ [i]New well-arranged UI [/i] 

[b]Cons[/b]

✪ [i]Bad optimization[/i] 
✪ [i]Population limit[/i] in skirmish is unchangeable
✪ [i]Removed hometown progress [/i] from the game
✪ [i]Online servers even for LAN [/i]  
✪ [i]Poor AI difficulty scaling[/i] 
✪ [i]Unbalanced civilizations[/i] 

[b]7.5/10[/b] 

Simply put, the game is great, but could be even better. 

If you want to play competitive modes (against other players) I would recommend you to just go and play age of empires II, which is much more adjusted to these purposes. But if you like to play solo or with friends against AI there are not many good modern RTSs to choose from and this one would be great fit for you.

I'll start with the good things about this game: The multiplayer matchmaking, and the updated graphics are the biggest pluses to me. Back in the day on ESO, getting a multiplayer game started was such a pain because everyone would look at your rank and you'd be too high or too low ranked and you'd get kicked from the lobby, but now that there's a working matchmaker I can actually play the game again. Another big change I love is that you no longer have to grind out homecity levels to get all the good cards, you get access to all the cards for every civ. Finally I like the addition of new civs. I played the asian dynasties expansion for a long time so I was used to all the civs and having some new ones to mess with was nice, and I hear there might be more getting added. 

Now onto some of the bad stuff. While I love the addition of the matchmaking, it is pretty buggy. There are times where the queue timer will go for like 10 seconds and then just kick me out of the queue for no reason and I have to restart my game to fix it. Another thumbs down for me is the awkward changes made to the game to cover up the concept of colonialism and westward expansion even though that's what the whole timeline of the game is centered around. Another complaint I have is navigating the menus. I've had the game bug out on me when I try to rename my homecity or my explorer, I've had the game take me from level 2 of the blood campaign to the India campaign for no reason. So like most games nowa days its pretty unpolished which is depressing. 

So in summary it's fine. It's an improvement from the og AOE 3 in several areas and it is nice to see this game being played again my more people eventhough it does sicken me in principal to buy a game I already own again. If you loved aoe 3 or any of the expansions go ahead and try this (ideally when it's on sale). Just don't expect as much love, or special attention to be given to this game like its aoe 2 de counterpart.",1616778482,1644363619,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

It wasn't Age of Empires 2-2, and that made me sad and confused. Everything was moving so fast, and there was too much different stuff for each civilization, and shipments/home cities touched me in a weird place.

Now, it feels like everything makes sense. I love that it gets going faster than a match of Age of Empires 2. I love how most civilizations actually feel different from each other, barring some of the European civilizations. I adore the concept of the home city, essentially a building that sends upgrades without ever being at risk while using a resource gained from doing basic tasks. I've discovered that I may like Age of Empires 3 even better than I once liked 2, and the Definitive Edition has made everything even better.

There are still some issues I have, of course. Age of Empires 2 has a very mature scenario modding community that Age of Empires 3 never seemed to get, and the base campaigns in Age of Empires 3 aren't as replayable in my eyes. And while post-release DLC has added some amazing civilizations (like the Hausa and Mexicans), we've only gotten a few post-release Historical Battles (1-scenario campaigns) for solo players. Luckily, I love how Skirmish matches feel in this game, but the campaigns could be expanded on a bit, even if via modding.

Overall, Age of Empires 3 may feel a little weird to people who have played the other games. There are no gather points, training can be done in batches, home cities ship units and upgrades, you can collect treasures... the list goes on. But if you can get into the fast-paced exploration and building and conquest, it can be very fun. ([strike]Please come play the game and get invested in modding it. There's so much untapped potential in these game systems.[/strike])

If you want to try an RTS game that gets going fast and has some (apparently unique) mechanics, give this version of Age of Empires 3 a try. If you get hooked, there's even DLC civilizations to try out now, with the potential for at least one more on the way.

I'll go trough various elements of the game design, and other features such as a story campaign, historical battles and such. I admit that I haven't finished any of the story campaigns or historical battles, but I feel that majority of its playerbase didn't too. I might be wrong, but I'll make one thing clear straight away: you don't play this game for its story.

Right, let's start of by describing the gameplay. Gameplay-wise it's your standard RTS game, but I'll elaborate it anyways: you recruit villagers to gather resources and build your base, and you train your military units to defend your base and attack the enemy base (standard ""skirmish"" match). It may sound simple, but truth be told that it's way more complex than that, at least in this game. You have to collect resources to make more villagers to gather even more resources as well as to 
 build your base, on top of that you have to recruit your military units in order to defend against enemy, or to destroy them. It may sound simple, but the trick is that your very playstyle depends on the faction you pick. Oh yes, there are factions. A lot of them. I don't know exactly how many, add some from DLCs, but you have a generous selection when it comes to factions, and thus the playstyle you need to master to be proficient and formidable opponent.

Difficulty wise, there are two options: you eighter play skirmishes (and a couple of other game modes against CPU) and you pick a difficulty there, or you decide to go to online ranked match making, or to a server browser, only to lose four matches in a row, and then by miracle you manage to overrun your opponent who has even less of an idea what he's doing. I don't mean to scare you away, but playing against other players is rather competitive, especially ranked (at least I got that impression). So yeah, playing against players is damn difficult, but don't worry about it: considering you're reading this review, you have access to internet, and therefore to Youtube and Google, which translates to capability to search for tutorials and guides how to get basics down, as well as some guides about playing different nations. That, combined by your unbreakable willpower to get out there and try and win against other players will make you a better player. Well, maybe not over night, but after some time, you'll be micro and macro your army and economy like a pro.

Graphics in this game are OK, nothing special. Since this is Definitive Edition, there are some fancy features included compared to the good 'ol AoE3 from 2005 (how time flies). You do need a somewhat decent rig to run this game, though. There are some neat nature and environment details here and there, should you have some spare time in a match to pay attention to.

As for the lenght of a game, it really depends what you define as a ""game"". A skirmish match? From 5 mins to extreme couple of hours (my record is around 90 or so mins in 2v2 skirmish online).For the game itself? I guess you could say infinite, or at least while there's a steady player base playing this game. This game is a masterpiece, almost, and I think lots of people will play AoE3:DE regardless of AoE4 being out for some time now. So, lenght of AoE3:DE is basically as long as you make it. You can play it 10 mins and never touch it again, or you could develop a crippling addiction and competitiveness and rack up 1000 hours in a month (it's not technically possible, don't bother lol).

As for the replay value, like I said: infinite times. It's like Battlefield, you win/lose a match, and hop into another one. 

*Please note I'm mostly reffering to the online aspect of the game, because that's why you decided to try this game out... Right?*

SFX and OST in this game is above average, slightly below brilliant in my opinion. The main theme is recognised immediately, and the rest of the OST is fitting. You won't really remember the rest of the OST, but it doesn't matter, since it's there to amplify the already amazing game experience.

I should touch on the story a bit more, but like I mentioned before: I haven't finished any of the campaigns. To be honest, I don't think most RTS's are a good platform for a story. It doesn't mean you can't have a good story, but if the good story is what you're after, there are lots of other games that do that brilliantly.

Aaaaand last bit about censorship and localisation. Nothing worth censoring, at least the way I see it. I think game design shouldn't differ no matter in what region you are, which means everyone gets the same gameplay experience. Yaaaaay. Though there were some language options, but nothing too much. Could be extended in my opinion. You wouldn't even need another voice actiong, since all unit voice lines are spoken in the unit native language (Brits speak English, Germans speak German, French speak Baguette ect.).

Of course, if you're lazy and decided to skip all this effort I put into the review, here's an extra short review: 

Buy it. It's a great game. Sure, there are some minor bugs and problems (looking at you, pathfinding), but that aside it's a really nice experience, which is even better if played with friends.

The reason is that the map sizes feel smaller and the number of building Units, has been capped. It has a better game play loop but I wish they would have included something new like perhaps features like if you build a close to another building a road appears kind of like the trade routes or the ability to build roads in the imperial age or something like that. 
It would have added another game element that would make the game feel more alive. I also would have liked to have the population cap and units cap removed since it kind of restricts the game play. I am not sure why they decided to do that but there should be on custom option at the very least in skirmish. 
The progression certainly feels better in this game and the core game play loop is still fun as ever.

The biggest fault I find in the game is despite the devs claiming major improvements to the game, AOE III never gave me stutters or crashes (on a high end gaming pc) and the pathing algorithm for troop movement is abysmal with your troops in a group 
1. Splitting up to take a different path which is clearly a dead end and then getting stuck and later backtracking or staying there till you manually backtrack them
2. Doing random shifting around during combat as it suddenly tries to get in formation. Why would you mess with the original combat logic? (The classic in formation during movement and break formation and rush the enemy as soon as combat begins)
3.While moving your troops/fleet, sometimes some ships move ahead of others and when you target someone, suddenly they shuffle to get in formation. Wtf?

The pathing is so horrible that I've had several moments when I'm exclaiming 'Wtf are you doing??!!' that make me want to break the game if it were a CD (you really dont want troops just running around in the middle of a fight getting hit but not shooting back). It is something you would encounter rarely or not at all in the original game, so unless you want to get the new civilizations or its on sale, I would recommend going for the original AOE 3 by Microsoft.",1642738339,1642738598,False,2,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

This game is a remaster, so I expected some nicer visuals and sounds, along with much needed QoL improvements. I bought the premise that it ""took a lot of work"" from the dev team, and was hoping for an all-around better version of the original AoE 3.
While we did get updated graphs + sounds, and [i]some[/i] QoL improvements, the product itself is not amazing.

First, the positives:
[list]
[*]This is, mostly, your standard Age of Empires III experience. If you liked the originals, you will most likely like this one as well.
[*]The multiplayer has recieved a much needed revamp, and I didn't experience any problems with it aside from very long loading times.
[*]There is new content being added, even if it's paid DLC. I didn't buy any of them, but new content is always good news.
[*]The unit group selection limit was increased from 50 units to 95. No clue why not 100, but it's a good improvement.
[*]Some historical innaccuracies and potentialy offensive portrayals were corrected, mainly concerning the nations from the Warchiefs expansion. Some may argue that this is pointless, but I guess making less people upset is a nice move.
[*]All of the shipments are now unlocked and are readily avaliable to be used, removing the need to either modify save files or grind for them.
[*]Achievements for this game now exist. It's a nice feature, I guess?
[*]Finally, this product is cheaper than the original game. This is weird to say the least, but it [i]is[/i] a better deal nowadays.
[/list]

Now, the negatives.
[list]
[*]While the graphic update is nice, it absolutely does not justify the ridiculously increased specs this game demands, especially the storage required.
[*]Second, if I'm paying for a remaster, I should not recieve a product that is inferior to the original in [i]any[/i] way. This game manages to have objectively worse AI for units regarding the attack move order and general pathfinding. This leads to some weird moments, such as when villagers will finish cutting a tree and will forget that they had a task, and proceed to just stand there doing nothing, even if they should be perfectly capable of continue doing their jobs, as they did in the originals.
[*]Third, this game lags A LOT when there are lots of units on the screen, like 50+ units.
While the originals did lag a bit in this situation, the framerate here goes from ~60 to astonishing [i]five[/i]. It's quite the awful experience to train a massive army to just to see a slideshow of a battle.
[/list]

Conclusion:
I made this negative review as a way to express how frustrated I am, both as a fan and as a customer, because the new flaws of the game were never acknowledged or patched. It feels like the devs don't care, and it hurts.
The game itself, however, is mostly fine. Is it the definitive experience it promises? No. But if you just want the experience of playing it, and aren't as nitpicky as I am, go for it.


Old review:
[spoiler]They somehow made it worse than the original game. Not only it's terribly optimised (it's so bad the frame rate is the same at max low and max high), but the textures are worse, the UI is horribly organised and will not scale properly and even the cinematics are worse. The sounds are stange too but that might just be me. I'm really disappointed, so much that I asked for a refund. This really feels like a scam, like I paid for a bootleg edition of the game.[/spoiler]",1602779164,1641618301,False,8,0,0.536439359188079834,0,True,False,False

Love this game, I really do. With 100+ hours on the OG version on Steam (not counting the probably 500+ I have on the original disced versions) It's a different take on AOE that while perhaps not everyone's cup of tea, is refreshing. And unlike AOE4 actually offers something *different*.

Innovation and Iteration done right. *however*...

While the gameplay is on point and I enjoy the mechanics of the game and whatever have you, there are a few game breaking issues. I've had a couple crashes while playing, more than I've ever had on the OG versions. More than I've had on any version of AOE2... pathing could be a bit better but it's nowhere near as bad as AOE1... but it definantly feels a lot less micro intensive, which for some might be a good thing... as it's much harder to dodge shots (if not impossible) and you can't micro out of the way of archer fire like you can in AOE2.

So that's the gameplay, which all in all is solid... but now comes... *sigh*... the campaign...

My god, the Campaign... what did they do to you? Let me preface this by saying I am aboriginal, so I think I can speak here...
- Changing how the Iroquois to haudenosaunee: Didn't really bother me, a little jarring when certain words are outright omitted from cut-scenes and it interrupts the flow of dialog but whatever, it's not that big a deal and they are technically correct.
- Changing how aboriginal civs play (Except the Aztecs and Inca?): Sure, fine, I can see what was attempted with the Asian Civs and some of the newer ones. I've no issue with altering how some civs play to get in that sweet sweet asymmetrical gameplay, but don't BS me that it's for anything else.

The biggest issue with a lot of the politically correct changes however, most heavily affect the story, and yeah, I know, it's an RTS, you generally don't play RTS games for their stories. But c'mon, I at LEAST would appreciate a cohesive narrative, given that the campaign is more character driven than any other AOE campaign has been... such changes are... (Minor Spoilers ahead)
- Why did they just straight up remove Nonakee's name from the game? Like... John Black never says it... despite their romance being a key part of his character... idk, It just feels weird that it's barely brought up.
- The Entirety of the Shadow Act, from The Warchiefs, it was completely rewritten... poorly, I might add. Mind you the original wasn't amazing, but it changed the Sioux that you originally fought into generic ""bandits""... I don't understand why this change was made given that the focus of the campaign in the original was about Red Cloud's War, which was a real event and instead glosses it over and seems to generally handwave a lot of things that fly in the face of their given reasons for making all the changes to the first nations civs to begin with. Idk... when I heard the line ""Sioux is what our enemies call us"" from Chayton during the 2nd (or 3rd?) Level I actually laughed aloud... now whenever someone asks me what types of First Nation I am, I respond with that (And Cree)... 

Otherwise the campaign was great up until that point... nothing has really changed in the Asian campaigns either though, given that they're more focused on historical events like AOE2 and 1's campaigns. It's just that last act which is poorly written.

So with all that said, great game, the mechanical and name changes they've made aren't as irritating as most claim (personally) and if you love a good RTS, you should be able to ignore them... and if you're new, you won't even notice them. It's just the old guard who will, but I don't see that as enough of a reason to skip this one... maybe just that last act of The Warchief's campaign... but hey, maybe you'll find something in it that I didn't.",1641449538,1641449538,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

the cons: the ai is utterly retarded in this game, not only your own but also the enemies one. if you have some ""more"" units in your squad, the units begin to brainfreeze and cant leave the squad because they get stuck in between each other, sometimes they simply wont move out of the way and die because of that. painful to watch it, especially when you have to move seperate units away so they get through. units just stand around and get hit until you get everyone to shoot at the same target, thats just sad because the second game got it better. the campaign is seperated into 2 difficulties: super family friendly easy mode and almost impossible hardcore massacre mode. some missions play on medium difficulty like they were designed for 6 year olds, in some missions you are getting obliterated like you are playing call of duty world at war on veteran mode. i really dont understand why choosing an concept like this was an good idea by the devs. i had to restart some missions like 5 times because i got owned like france got  owned in 1940 by germany

conclusion: game looks very good but plays mediocre for me because of all the said cons",1640807962,1641256943,False,5,1,0.393930047750473022,0,True,False,False

- A lot of disconnections
- memory leaks

- Tantalus Media needs to invest in a QA team because i can't believe they have one at the moment.

A change in names so as not to offend people which I personally find absolutely pathetic. For example, changing plantation to estate, colonial age to commerce age and changing mission units from native indians to ''oppressive colonialist'' units. The game is literally set in the colonial age. I wont be buying anymore age of empires products because they clearly have an agenda to keep history fanatics like myself away from their games

Edit: I would like to add the game is full of bugs. In ranked multiplayer mode, I've been unexpectedly disconnected or my game has crashed and these crashes result in lost games which goes twoards your global rank. I can say that a large portion of my losses have been caused because of sudden game crashes and disconnections.

So let me recap a few things that I noticed here and here :
- the unit cap for a selection is still 50 units, like in the base game. That never got fixed. Consider that some endgame cards spawn 24 units at once, you're forced to have several groups if you have any decent army,
- the maps are still small, and your options during map generation are hilariously limited. What you see on the thumbnail when picking a map isn't a sample, it's the map you'll actually get, so exploration is less interesting. That, too, was in the base AoE3 and never got fixed,
- the different factions are extremely unbalanced. Whether or not it's a big issue depends from your point of view,
- despite not owning any DLC, I still get to play against Ethiopean. Their voices lines are butchered and horribly loud, while old units are a lot less loud,
- the home city are just plain unfair : the factions that were in vanilla AoE3 get a degree of cosmetic customization, while Aztecs and Incans don't get any customization, and the American-Indians only get 4 people standing awkwardly around a campfire and avoiding eye contact,
- the maps are still too damn small,
- the fog of war needs some desaturation to make it more obvious if it's present or not,
- and finally, upon starting the game for the first time, you get a pop window basically saying that the developpers are super-not racist at all and did their best to accurately represent the different people portrayed in the game. Which, again, is a matter of opinion, but I see it as virtue-signalling, since, as I said earlier, Amerindians factions have underwhelming assets, and the Ethiopean explorer is loud when he croaks under my gatlings.

Overall, a very underwhelming ""Definitive Edition"", with very little skill showed on AoE2DE. The games does little to fix its vanilla counterpart's issues. Its only redeeming grace is that it finally has the game in a single package, compared to AoE3 Steam that forced you to pick between the different expansions.


EDIT : and since the last patch, I can't even play it anymore. Good job.
EDIT AGAIN : I can play again, and the mesoamerican factions got some city personalization. AND, the devs have added a ""big map"" option which makes the game really enjoyable, so I changed my recommendation to positive.
EDIT AGAIN, AGAIN : Holy cow, they also upped the unit selection cap. It's definitely a positive review now.",1628434557,1639965537,True,0,0,0.478260844945907593,0,True,False,False

Solid story, good pacing, well thought-out missions and long enough to make it feel like you got your money's worth.  And the game has enough unique features to make it feel different to the other Age of Empires games. Highly recommended for single player strategy fans!

I'm off to play the other campaigns.

Edit: Finished the Fire and Shadow campaigns. A plug in to the original story. Similar in terms of dynamics. More of the same but not in a bad way.

Edit: Finished the Asian Dynasties campaigns: A breath of fresh air with completely new civilisations. Recommended.

Edit: Busy with the historical battles. I love them. Every civilisation is unique and well crafted (although I can't comment on multiplayer balance because I don't play multiplayer). I just wish there were more historical battles.

Final Edit: Done with the historical battles. Some good variance and its nice to be able to try out different civilisations. It felt like there is space for more scenarios. I would love a DLC which adds 15-20 odd historical battles for the standard civilisations and then an additional handful of historical battles for each of the DLC civilisations. There are so many real life historical battles to recreate. 

Overall, AOE3 is a LOT better than I remember it being. I've been playing RTS games since Dune 2 and I there hasn't been one that I've enjoyed as much as Aoe3 in recent memory.

Last side note: After finishing all the campaigns and the historical battles on hard, I only mustered up 10 achievements in total.",1636807330,1639682744,True,50,0,0.751865625381469727,0,True,False,False

I don't do online gaming and bought this for the me vs. pc side of it. Pretty nice new story mode and historical battles are also there for me. The skirmish option is pretty useless as the pc seems not to have any real teeth at any level so... If your a solo gamer don't expect a long term game but its worthwhile if on sale for sure. I had bought all the add-ons on sale as well and as far as solo gamers go they are about worthless - they could have added more story modes which are fun (this has 3) but instead only added a couple historical single battles so solo guys may want to steer clear of those add-ons as they pretty much are not for us and not worth a dime for us. Also, you will get more mileage out of part 2 for sure in solo vs machine but this is definitely worth it if on a good sale.

Edit: After playing this more, I've come to an unsettling realization: every positive review of this game is a bot or a payed promotion. because the game is WORSE than I thought. The performance problems are related to a memory issue so old I haven't seen it since custom Warcraft 3 maps. And this ""definitive edition"" somehow BROKE the AI. Good ole' Ivan the Terrible is going outside to a corner store or something, because his full stack army is just sitting in his base, not doing anything. Yet despite not participating anymore, AI Ivan has the highest score in the game by a wide margin, which I wouldn't care about if it didn't mean he was going to steal 500 xp from me in the post-game.

Edit 2: Lets add FURTHER to the condemnation of this POS, there's an event ongoing at the time of this review. One of the TEDIOUS objectives is to revolt 3 times. This wouldn't be bad if not for two things. The first is that if you exit the game before completing the challenge, you lose your progress, so you NEED to play 3 games in a row.

A few quick hits, which gives you an idea of what you will find in AoEIII, but which also serves as a counterpoint/comparison to AoK:
-the campaigns in AoEIII aren't that good: the overall stories and the writing are cringe-worthy, and it feels like someone's elementary school writing project -- not only are the stories not good, but they feel out of place for the period that the game tries to set itself in, but fails for being way too all over the place. Also, for a game called 'Age of Empires', it's rather boring to follow the members of a Metis family while they try to establish a railroad (even fighting against the US while doing so) or prospecting gold. I mean, what? There is no sense of historical scale to what you are doing. The 'retelling' or the US War of Independence is so fantasical that it takes away from any stakes. Worse thing is that the suckiness of the story isn't remedied by good scenarios with good gameplay, even on moderate most missions (that I bothered actually playing) felt like a cakewalk, and could be done with the starting troops+a few card deliveries from the home city (playing at moderate difficulty, the middle of the three difficulty options).
-The gameplay more broadly just isn't that fun, my opinion is that it's just full of gimmicks that don't gel too well together, and a few differences and distinctions that fail to coalesce into anything resembling actual strategic depth. For some reason I can't quite put my finger on, even though the developers have gone out of their way to make every civilization be a bit different, they end up feeling all too similar.

My strong recommendation is to pass on this game. Age of Kings is a much better game. As it is written, I have spent 24 hours on this as of writing this. Comparatively, I have about 240 hours on Age of Kings, most of which I've played over the last couple months. Regardless, AoE3 keeps making me want to play Age of Kings more. (Also, in those 24 hours, I've earned nearly 80% of current achieves, and I could already be at 100% if I had the African Kingdoms DLC. After my 240 hours, I am 100% on Age of Kings, and while they weren't all very difficult they do feel earned and I had fun every step of the way. I can't say the same with AoE3.)",1638749966,1638749966,False,2,0,0.462763726711273193,0,True,False,False

Positives:
1.  Good Graphics (it is a 4k graphics game, so this is a no duh thing.""
2.  The campaign and battle maps look nice, so some effort was given to make things look rather interesting vs boring.
3.  You can win with a variety of unit types and options within each civilization.  
4.  No 1 civilization completely dominates battles
5.  The game makers have finally given the option to allow you to select which in-match cards you can deploy from the beginning.  Aka, the grinding has been removed.  
6.  The game makers are starting to allow people to modify non-original civilization's home cities (it took them long enough)
7.  They are finally adding more civilizations into the game, and are giving people a limited time to earn them with achievable tasks.  (Thank you game makers!)
8. They are allowing customers to start buying individual civilizations without having to buy ones that the gamer does not want to play as.  (Thank you game makers!)
9.  There are finally larger map sizes.

Negatives:
1.  The campaigns and many of the ""historical"" battles are rather boring so far as the story plot is concerned.  (The Asian campaigns were the closest to having the thrill of the Age of Empires 1-2 fun, but it was still lacking in detail.  Check out the Chinese campaign and use the cheat to see the whole map if you want to see what I am talking about)
2.  The game makers forgot that they were making an Age of Empires game when they did the ""historical"" battles and the campaigns.  Apparently they thought that they were making a World of Warcraft mod given the fact that you did not start with the ability to create a base or start with a base at the start of the game.  
3.  The 200 unit cap is ridiculously low given the fact that the Age of Empires 1-2 Definitive Editions have a 500 unit cap, and to this day, the game makers still have not added the ability to have 500 units.
4.  Defensive structure caps.  Age of Empires 1-2 did not have a limit on how many defensive towers or castles that it had.  This game should not either.  This is a major downgrade in tactical options.
5.  Name changes to Civilizations, units, and structures.  I understand the desire to not accidentally offend anyone, but seriously.  Let the player determine if they want that name change or if they can keep it how it was before.  The Iriquois Confederacy is a whole lot easier to say and remember than whatever the hell the game makers replaced it with.  If people want you to censor the game to make it more politically correct, have it be a paid mod, not something that is shoved down everyone's throats from the get go.  It annoys long time players who frequently are the ones who are encouraging their friends to buy your game.
6.  There is a limit of 4 teams in team play.  Age of Empires 1-2 can have up to 8
7.  Challenge completion data is not shared between computers.  Example.  I was 52% complete with the United States Challenge on 1 computer.  Due to the Xbox Live not syncing the completion data, it stubbornly showed that I was only 42% complete on a different computer.
8. Black washing characters and icons in European/American or Latin civilizations.

Note to the game makers.  People who buy a game with the ability to create a base, want to be able to create a base or expand an already existing base on EVERY SINGLE MAP AND MISSION!  If we wanted to play World of Warcraft or a game similar to it, we would be playing that game and not buying or playing yours!!!!  So STOP adding maps or missions that do not have the ability to make or use a base!!!!

Note 2 for game makers.  Stop trying to race change units and icons.  I know you are doing this for PC reasons or ""diversity inclusiveness.""  The CORRECT way to do this is to add new factions with the minority groups you believe should be there.  The INCORRECT way to is to blackwash non-black factions in order to force inclusivity.  If you continue this, I will not purchase any more of your expansion packs for this game, or any other games or expansion packs for the other game series that you are working on.  I will not support the corruption of history by YOUR racist bigotry against European, Latin, and Asian populations.  I will also apply this stance towards other games made by your parent corporation.  Remember, computer games and video games are NOT necessary for one to enjoy life, and you are NOT the only game makers out there.  When you start shoving your politics into your games, you will permanently lose customers.  

This game does have its fair share of flaws.  It is well worth buying it on sale if you can ignore the anti-European, Latin, and Asian undertones of some of the newer subtle updates they are adding to the game.",1619572220,1638707472,False,0,0,0.497167110443115234,0,True,False,False

I loved CC and got this the moment I got my new computer that could actually run it (and run it really well, I've played plenty of more demanding games with no problems). The gameplay itself is actually really good, using good unit comp to obliterate your enemy never gets old and being able to outboom is always fun. However, with DE I've had so many frustrations that I didn't nearly have with CC. 

The problem is that it arguably has more issues, both performance and in balancing. I have had significantly more disconnects, out of syncs and random resigns here than in CC. I have had posts about it on the official forums, people say they are looking into it and nothing. I reported back in June that you can't use shift commands properly on hunts when you're using more than 8 vills and it still hasn't been fixed. And now that the Mexico civ is here there is plenty of broken bullshit to go around. Who thought that a 7.5 min fast industrial is balanced? Like really, when most civs can only do a 6-6.5 min fast fortress? The new civs are so overloaded with mechanics and features, meanwhile old civs like Russia and the Aztecs are still boring to play, with the Inca doing everything the Aztecs do but better. Meaning, apart from meme strats (like invis coyote runners) there's no reason to play Aztecs when Incas are flat out better. Not only that, but they got rid of key things from CC, such as a working ranked system to let you know who was and wasn't good (Stars + chevrons don't count) as well as a lag indicator in the pre game lobby.

Further to that, the playerbase is just really low and the community mentally impaired. Going in at seemingly any point the lobbies will mostly be filled the following:
-People who don't name their lobbies with any name (sticking to their username + game) then just randomly kick you
-High level players team stacking against low level players then kicking when you complain
-AFK lobby hosts. 
-People who pick really weird lobby settings but don't say it in the title so you load in and you have to instaquit. 
-Teammates who never communicate and refuse to listen to any helpful advice. Had a ranked team game where my Japan ally didn't shrine boom, didn't FF, didn't rush and sent cav against the enemy's musk rush.
That and it's hard to just get a good high level game going, there simply aren't enough people playing to get a high enough playerbase where you can actually get tested, it's all 90% noobs who can't use shift commands or don't even know a simple build order.

I won't really bother going into the woke shit that they introduced with this release, since it doesn't really impact gameplay. I just find it interesting that they made censors that barely even work, censored the work colonialsm from the game and tried to be more accurate for the American civs, meanwhile the game still has key issues that haven't resolved and several civs in the game are hilariously historically inaccurate.

tldr, the game itself is actually really fun, since they just copied the fundamentals from CC, but they've introduced so many issues and bugs with this DE release that it's just painful to play",1638531824,1638532095,False,6,1,0.511298179626464844,0,True,False,False

Possibly the greatest attraction is how each civilization has something that makes them unique, the card system that thank god this Definitive Edition eliminates the need to grind to unlock them and how fun is the combat.

From the point of view of someone who plays casually, this is the most fun ""Age of"" to play against the CPU and with friends, and the main campaign, even if it isn't as enjoyable as the one on Age of Mythologies, is super fun to complete.

Specifically speaking of this definitive version, the new civilizations and general changes are very welcome to refresh the experience of the game. Possibly the most controversial are the changes to certain names that can be felt as historical revisionism, which makes feel that there is a certain inconsistency since everything that is not related to the United States has a lot of errors and inaccuracies.

Leaving that aside, if you want to enjoy a game casually, this is the Age of Empires that I recommend the most. If you prefer something more competitive-focused, maybe you better play Age of Empires II: DE or IV.",1638369865,1638369865,True,65,1,0.82620692253112793,2,True,False,False

Addressing some things people dislike:

[b] The Name Changes [/b]
Honestly, I personally do not care about the name changes as much as others. Does it seem pointless? Yea lol. Does it actually change the game that my colonial militia are now called revolutionary militia? No lol. 

Now sure I suppose it can be fair to be a bit annoyed at these name changes, but I personally think some of these reactions to them to be a bit over-exaggerated? It's hardly like these changes were a secret either, so if you hate them so much, why buy the product to begin with lol.


[b] Minor change [/b]
Some people are fairly upset over some minor changes such as all cards being unlocked at once & the new ranking system. I think both of these complaints are a bit daft considering the aoe3 community, that still played the game, like me, actually had been asking for this for ages. Having to unlock cards created a very inequal playing field amongst players in multiplayer, making it unbalanced as hell. As for the ranking system, this one takes more into account what you actually do during games, and doesnt arbitrarily throw you down 30 ranks because you lost 5 games in a row because half of your team DCed due to the peer to peer connection.

As it stands, both of these changes are pretty good as it allows aoe3 to have a better competitive element than the old one.

[b] The lag [/b]
Okay this is a negative I can get behind. Although I have yet to experience crashing, occassionally (typically once per game for me) you will have a period where your frames just tank. This really can hurt games like this where you really do have to be aware of your surroundings and manage alot at once. This game does need a lot more optimising, with this being said, the game is still very much playable. I'm running a middle-end PC made 7 years ago and I generally can play this fine.
----
[b]  THE GOOD! [/b]
[b]  Graphics [/b]
Honestly, I like them. Some people say they look cartoony and ""like a mobile game"" (because non-hyper realistic is apparently automatically a mobile game) but honestly the keey the old style alive and make the game just feel a lot more lively. Age of Empires 3's visuals were never really the selling-point, but this graphical overhaul just seems to be appealing and true to the original.

[b] Politicians  [/b]
When you age up in age of empires 3, you must select a politician that'll grant you certain things (be it units, resources, buffs and more). Originally there were only 3, and usually you'd only ever go with the quatermaster/400 wood politician, but now with the politician rework, there are a lot more viable options. This adds A LOT more strategy to the game, whilst still keeping true to old game mechanics.

[b] The new additions [/b]
There are new additions to the game that are just generally kind of cool, like the Swedes & Incans. Two entirely new civilisations to play with! Both do need some minor balancing updates, but other than that, they're pretty neato to have.

Oh yea, the historical battles have a lot of potentially considering age of empires 3 covers a rather large time period, so holy crap, imagine what we could potentially have! Be it napoleonic war, history battles, the plains of Abraham battle, and more! 

---
[b]  TLDR [/b]

Graphics cool

New stuff cool

Balancing needed

A lot of optimising needed

Who cares about the name changes? yea its cringe but it doesn't make the game itself any less fun lol. 

Some people are getting too ticked off over minor things that weren't really a secret to begin with... so why did they buy it knowing they'd hate it...

I really recommend this game to anyone with an itch for a quality historical game with deep mechanics and fast strategic gameplay. The factions are incredibly diverse and I really think something can be found for any taste.


First things first - this game is now completely fixed and has been for some time now. There are no game breaking bugs anymore (or for me no noticeable bugs, which in a strategy game with hundreds of diverse units is remarkable) and devs are regularly shipping out updates to new and existing factions, balance updates, completely new mechanics (yesterday Skull Knight - elite Aztec unit - got spin to win ability) and making this game better than ever before. It's also beautiful with grand orchestral music and has a growing community of single- and multiplayer-minded people. I really recommend trying if you like strategy games.


WARNING - This game is DEEP and if you want to play multiplayer you will have to learn most factions mechanics' and decks of cards they can use, because ATM there are 17 completely unique factions with different playstyles and decks of cards, which represent different historical units (like Longbowmen for Brits), buildings (Dojo for Japs) and technologies (Solingel Steel for Germany) or cultural aspects (Spanish Gold for, you guessed it, Spain): 

- Original 8 (European) factions have similar units (with every single one having quite a few unique units and upgrades that completely change the existing ones) but insanely different mechanics (compared to AOE2), which show already in how the factions play (Dutch want to build banks so they can buy their villagers with coin and go for the late game, while Ottomans produce villagers for free, but have to focus their resources into their unique church, which buffs villagers and their production and so you can focus on early game, then again Spanish seem ""vanilla"", but then you realize how they use fast shipments of cards to boost any unit they have and go for a different strategy every game, of which some can make this faction quite hard to play and fun as farts).
Then they all have about 15 different revolution civilizations, which again completely change how the original faction plays. Then they all have their unique decks (some of the cards shared) which offer like 5-20 playstyles for each civilization and allow you to customize your civilization as you want (you can go for strong cavalry raids with Germans, or just go for heavy infantry and horse wagons to go crushing). Then you spice that up with powerful but costly mercenary units which you can hire from all over the world (Ports love going for Egyptian Mamelukes, so they don't have to invest in their own cav because of their already expensive and quality roster, while Russians can go for Ninjas in the late game to sneak in and destroy enemy artilery, Ports or Brits just hire theaters from where they can hire Ronin for cheap). Then you can mix all that with about 20 different minor tribes which you can befriend on every wonderful map (Brits love Cherokee, which they can hire for cheap in the second age to cover their lack of skirmishers). Yeah. This is the basic stuff.

- Then there are 2 original expansions which add 3 civilizations each. Warchiefs adds 3 Mesoamerican civilizations with completely unique roster and playstyle each. Aztecs like to use their priests for rituals that spawn warriors or boost different aspects of their civilization, then build a powerful roster of pure infantry like Eagle runner knights or fast coyote runners for every different occasion. They excel in the late game, when their infantry is upgraded, but even in early game a well placed skull knight can kill a whole unit of enemies.
Haudenosaunee (Iroquis) are the most difficult civilization to play IMO and sport a diverse roster of cavalry, warriors, siege equipment and powerful stealthy gunpowder infantry and cannons, which all mix in weird defensive playstyle with aggressive pushes when you go and hire a few allies.
Lakota just forego defense all together and can't even build defenses (exept with a dew cards from their deck (or allies' help), but they use a crazy powerful roster of some of the most powerful cavalry like musket riders, bow riders, axe riders and Tokala soldiers (the best shock cavalry in game) for raiding and really micro-intensive playstyle.
All these factions also employ animals and beasts to gain early economic advantage, or just make jaguars instead of cavalry and go to town (literally). Their warchiefs are also able to convert human treasure guardians for early raiding and even more treasures.

- The Asian Dynasties was the second original DLC, which added 3 Asian factions, which are even more diverse, but may be a little less difficult to play. They all have incredibly unique rosters, but focus on more defensive gameplay with wonders they can build to get awesome boosts throughout the game. They all start with the best explorers (monks) and just get through early game through many different abilities they eploy. Japanese focus on exploration in the early game, then transition into powerful military. They usually focus on one of samurai, ashigaru musketeer, or yumi bowmen for core of their forces, then mix in fast cavalry, long range arrow cannons, elite daimyo or their own powerful mercenaries like ninjas, ronin, monks or mongolian cavalry archers. Indians focus on powerful fortresses, then go for camels for raiding, powerful infantry for skirmishing, or just go all in on like 7 different elephant units and just build from there. Chinese are the most unique in that they don't build single units, but overwhelm the enemy with armies of less powerful, but also quite cheap units, which they combine with their incredible rocket artillery, flamethrowers, monks or a roster of armored or fast raiding cavalry. Then all three factions employ their European allies in consulate to trade their unique resource - export - for economical, technological or military gains.

- The Definitive Edition factions are Inca and Sweden, which build on the original European and Mesoamerican factions. Inca build heavy fortresses and use REALLY fast and numerous infantry and tactics like poisonous arrows to clash with the enemy. Their most unique ability is a kancha house, which is a building that produces food, so they can be more turtle-y and then just explode out when they build their army up - or raid you with stealthy runners. They also can have stealthy jungle castles. Their power is economics and they are one of the best late game civilizations. Then Sweden is a weird and micro intensive European power, which uses tiny hobit grass houses to absorb resources around, which gives them incredible mid-game where they can spawn resources like blueberries, mines, trees, elk... to fuel their strategies like elite carolean infantry, raiding heavy hand cavalry, pretty beefed-up cannons or one of the best mercenary strategies around.

- The new USA faction is the most complicated of all and is unique in that their basic roster of units is pretty glass-cannon, not even that strong, but then they use immigrants to populate their town and borrow bonuses from other European factions (like Dutch bank, powerful German settler wagons, free Chinese trading posts...) and hire units from all over the world like Magyar Hussars, Brit grenadiers, French Dragoons, German Uhlans OR focus on boosting their own units into the sky with powerful upgrades. They also use completely unique age up mechanics, which see them invite a federal state into the UNITED states, who then again also bring unique cards and improvements with them, some of which other factions can get in their decks, but USA is a sweet mix of all of that. They can also go for all out cowboy strategy, which I find quite fun. Ohh, and they can buy Alaska, which comes with silver and polar bears and all.

Now its finally polished, and frankly more enjoyable than Age IV. No more bugs and minor renaming fixed by mods. 

-----------------------------------------------
PREVIOUS REVIEW:
Until they fixed all the immersion-breaking bugs, its not great.
- On Warchief and Asian Dynasties campaign, audio often looping/repeating itself, this is annoying when it happens to character speech on cinematic and SFX during battle.
-Unit garrisons themselves on the building they built, took me a while to find where did the idle villagers hide, they might be scared by the battle around them.
- Add Image sharpening or improve texture rendering distance, sometimes the original looks sharper and has more detailed texture compared to DE on the same zoom level, while DE texture is actually sharper when zoomed in.
- texture sometimes fails to load, so either buiilding and units are just a bunch of colored blobs for a minute or more.
- Sometimes standard - moderate AI doesn't progress at all, they didn't even care to build anything, just relying on spamming villager and getting left behind.
- Allow us to choose "" Colonial Age "" instead of "" Commerce Age "" for reasons.

Once fixed, its a good game.",1602804223,1637891752,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b]Newest and last entry in remastered trilogy of cult-classic real-time strategy games does not dissapoint and offers overall good experiece, but considering hopes and expectations left after treatment of Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition - leaves certain amount of unfulfillment. [/b]

   Considering the age of all the games in the 'Age of Empires' series, the climate and specificity of today's market, the fact of the existence of this refreshed version of the game is still a surprise (not as big as in the case of AoE I) and deserves praise - one for developers and the community, the second - for the publisher who gave the project the green light and continues to support the game after its premiere.
Unfortunately, as in the case of the two previous Definitive Editions, it was not without a handful of problems on the premiere, fortunately, as in the case of other titles, the development team remains in contact with the community from the first day and regularly releases updates, eliminating errors and adding finishing touches this game needs.

   I think it is important to realize the outset what type of release 'AoE III: DE' is - when it comes to modifying the engine core, range of changes and improvements to the game, by comparison it is roughly in the middle of the quality of the AoE II HD and DE release. Despite great, updated visuals deep down this is still roughly the same code as in 2005 version, and unfortunately you have to adjust your hopes accordingly when it comes to expectations to what was done here.
At the moment, after a few patches, the biggest problem is and will probably remain in some form,the performance in the context of the multiplayer mode, but also the solo skirmish mode while played with more players, and thus - units. Nevertheless - I am convinced that there is still room for action and in the upcoming updates devs will try to smooth the edges where possible. This applies to both optimization and netcode quality but also AI, which from time to time leaves something to be desired.

   With all the campaigns, a new historical mission mode and 'The Art of War' challenges completed, a lot of hours in skirmish mode and some multiplayer games - I can safely say that AoE III: DE is a solid remaster and during the my playtime I have not met any no major bugs, and even the mentioned optimization was not a problem 95% of the time.
Many concerned reviewers point to changes made to the content itself - generally 'DE' is same as the Complete Edition of the original release, however, the developers allowed themselves to make changes to some elements, which is always quite controversial. In my opinion, apart from a few questionable changes made to terminology, there is no reason to be too upset - most of the changes, even if not necessarily needed from the player's perspective, seem justified after exploring the motivation behind the developers. I certainly don't sense any bad intentions here. Anyway, these are all cosmetic elements (name of certain Indian nation, model of a building, flag pattern or era name etc.), not affecting the gameplay itself.

   All the rest of the potential stipulations are wishful issues, most of them rather unrealistic due to technical or budgetary constraints: map browsing system like in 'AoE II: DE', home city customization for factions that do not have it + more options where it was present, advanced inteface scaling options. And of course, completely new story content just like one for the Definitive Edition of the second game. However, looking at it realistically - both the size of the multiplayer community and sales that are unlikely to be close to AoE II:DE'- the chances for it are slim. Well, one can always dream.

   This is probably the last version of the game to ever be released. And although it is not a complete dream come true, it still offers a lot of fun, a lot of content and very nice visuals.
Worth recommending and fully worth its price regardless of previous experience with the game and considering all circumstances 'AoE III: DE' is a reason for celebration for fans of the series and the whole genre - especially in the current times, not easy for classic RTS games. 
I hope that the game will remain supported at least until the release of AoE IV - it's hard to imagine a fairer and more useful marketing tool than ongoing support for previous titles in the series. 

----------
[i]By the way, if possible, I highly recommend checking out the original Complete Edition from 2007. For people with weak/older machines, it will probably run as good if not better, but most of all it is worth getting acquainted with some mods that came out for it. A good place to start your search is Moddb or the 'Age of Empires Heaven' website. While the big mods are less numerous than ones for games like LotR: BfME2 or 'C&C: Generals', there are still enough to choose from.[/i]",1611850331,1637782312,True,11,0,0.551932871341705322,0,True,False,False

They also removed leveling system from cards, they are all unlocked from the beginning (this could be fair for online matches but there won't be feeling for achieving new things as you progress, which is a negative aspect from a gaming perspective). Updated graphics are cool and there is also cloud saving which the original lacks, but those are the only things that are better than the original.

I've loved everyone of them, but my personal preference and favortie has been III.  I love the colonial age and while some people may be sensitive to the time period due its savagery(and unfortunately some terms have been changed from the original becouase of said sensitives), I have always felt that this series provided history in all its glory and horror.  I truly believe that to learn from history you have know the good and the bad or we are apt to make the same misakes!  

This game has a unique home city system that sets it apart from 1,2, and now 4.  and the card system while maybe overwhelming a first, offers a wide variety of combinations of how you play every country.  It offers a fun way to replay the game and adds fun times playing with friends trying to out do one another.  multiplayer is great after few patches which addressed load times and connection issues and has some fun modes of play to spice things up!  Of course the single player is classic and well done.  

If there are some cons, i would say that the single player while introduces the home city card systems doesn't show a lot of what the different countries can utilize and how some countries have unique synergies to them but thats the fun of playing skirmishes and multiplayer to find out! plus theres always youtube to find out meta decks.  Lastly what most people who say they like others to this is cannons and how op they were was the reason they went back to 2 all the time.  While they are very strong there are ways to counter like in any game its up the player to figure it out or again youtube it!!

The game is set a little bit more modern than I would have liked, being all civies end with firearms and cannons. One thing I'm not fond of, is many armies share the same unit types, sometimes they don't even reskin them.

Main menu. Multiplayer lobby search. Mid-match multiplayer. Mid-match singleplayer. I have not tried the campaign but other players have reported that crashes often as well. So I'm not going to bother.

I find this mostly unacceptable. The game has been out for almost three weeks and none of the updates they claim have ""fixed"" the crashing issues have actually fixed them. I still crash just as often and in the same places. Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion crashes less than this game does. How am I expected to have fun with the game if I can't play it?

This is aside from a ton of other bugs and issues I've come across that still have not been addressed. Units getting stuck in buildings. Armies ignoring attack orders. Missing UI elements on certain units. Memory leaks. Silly AI.

This game is also a GPU hog. I've never played a game that makes my GPU work as hard as this one does.

I love Age of Empires, and I love AOE III, but in it's current state this Definitive Edition is unstable and borderline unplayable. It has left me frustrated and disappointed many, many times already since release.

Edit: I wanted to give the game another shot after leaving it alone for a while, hoping that some of these problems would be addressed. I tried multiple single-player skirmish games, with each one crashing after 10 or so minutes with ""ran out of memory"" errors.

No other game has given me low memory errors. I have a Windows 10 PC with 16GB DDR4 RAM, and no other program or window running besides Steam, this game, and Discord. My setup is well above the recommended specs listed on the store page.

1. Extreme AI is smarter so more interesting to fight them but their resource gathering is obviously cheating. That's not a big problem though, the problem is that your ALLY would just watch your town centre burning with their troops idle. And that's it with 3 combined army from your enemy, you don't stand a chance. STUPID ALLY AI. I don't like to play multiple players bcz of the internet problem, so what else can I enjoy?
2. Is it just me or the points from leveling up are used for customizing your home city only? It's beautiful design but upgrading your cards from you home city is what I like most about AOE 3. It's what make AOE 3 the best game for me compared to other AOEs. And now it's gone.

No shade toward AOEIII, but there is next to nothing that tops AOEII. The easy controls, great campaigns, and different cultures you could build and conquer with, along with a very easy to grab ahold of control layout,  was (and still is Imo) what made the game  so ""huge"" but still simple to play endlessly along with a steady run of near perfect satisfaction. (We all hate losing when we feel like raising the difficulty LOL)

There needs to be more basic choices for different types of character civilizations that you can play as in AOEIII However, The entire game series is Most Ultimate B@d@$$ in my most honest and humble opinion.

I have played these games since I was a young man and will continue to do so until my dying day if i can.

Please make a new release of SOMETHING. Even if it is a remaster of an old/original/archived/new idea ( AKA remake the Greek/Roman empires or something). 

I greatly thank the production team and developers that played any part in making these games into a tangible reality that (hopefully at this point) millions of people get to enjoy.

I truly thank you kindly.

Unfortunately, AoE3 (DE) is often dragged through the mud by the very loud and entrenched AoE II community. 
The game breaks with the known traditions and goes new ways, brings new approaches and a lot of refreshing variety, which may not always please die-hard AoE II fans.

But these loudmouths do this game and this worthy definitive edition an injustice.
You can feel that this game was developed with a lot of love and heart and soul.
Interesting character focused campaigns, hometown & deck mechanics, lots of maps, a great scenario editor, good graphics that look far better than AoE IV, and lots of very different civs that offer great variety make this game and this DE for me personally and for many others the best Age so far and brings back fond childhood memories.

Hopefully it will be supplied with content for a long time to come!

However, they changed some of the mechanics that I loved (and surely many others love as well). Examples: The Sioux/Lakota don't mine stone (which makes sense) but also the explorer doesn't tame wild animals, which also makes sense but takes out the fun to play with a distinct troop. They took the rituals/dancing building which was a different and fun mechanic, which for me was disappointing. The voice should be better, but I also prefer the old one, they say they used native descendants to proper represent but how about ""good acting""? ... In general, I think it took out a bit of fun, unique mechanics, and a few distinguishable aspects of some civilizations. Historically more accurate? yes.

Pros

- Balance patches (The original version was severely impacted OP units; namely the French Gendarme and Russian Box formation);

- Unit Variety and Civ Diversity (Each Civ feels fresh and unique unlike the recycled ones in Age of Empires 4);

- DLC (Regular updates that bring new Civs, scenarios, maps and so much more);

- A Community that actually cares (Yes.. this is rare in modern games);

- Fantastic art style with incredibly detailed siege and naval animations (Just sit and admire the sheer size of them Warships)

Negatives

- High skill gap (beginners [mostly those writing negative comments by the looks of it] will struggle with the pace of matches, especially online)

- Large rosters and unique Civs = longer time needed to master each

- Removed references to historical elements (links to 'colonialism' namely) [However, I welcome the corrections to reflect more accurately the customs, traditions and practices of Aboriginal and First Nation peoples.

- Tit-for-Tat between the Age of Empires 2 and Age of Empires 3 Community (Yes.. Age 2 players do not like Age 3 and thus will sadly try to deter players joining by writing negative comparisons) [Both games are excellent in their own way]

Overall

I would highly recommend this game to new and returning players alike due to its sleek and rich game-play coupled with an active dev team/community that strive to provide players with a healthy cycle of balance patches and additional content.

I think the most disappointing aspect of this game is its ""Story Mode."" While Age of Empires I and II plunged players into some of the greatest real world military campaigns of history (be it in Ancient Greece, Shang China, The 100 Years War, or the Muslim side of the Crusades), Age of Empires III elected for a fictional (and, frankly, absurd) plot revolving around fake characters only vaguely intersecting with real moments in history. Disappointingly, those stories are told in ways that vastly downplay the horrors of the Colonial Era, and frustratingly, the game is set during a historical moment ripe with incredible potential for campaigns (the consolidation of a German State, the 30 Years War, The Formation of the Aztec or Incan Empires, The Taiping Rebellion, The Meiji Restoration, Revolutions in France, Haiti, The United States, and Russia just to name a few, not to mention the most obvious choice for a storied campaign: Napoleon!).

For starters what is the point on skirting around calling it commerce age instead of colonial age in a game about colonies?
If you go to any African stage you can find the bandits, they is an NPC that is LITERALLY called ""Colonial Oppressor"", And it has a face that is reminiscent of caricatures of Jewish people. On top of that you make the African Civs overpowered. Like really, The English have the Longbow men up until the last age, but the Hausa which are the African equivalent a Steppe tribe, and you give them a much better bow troop, a better firearm troop, better cavalry AND more troop variety? 
You also give them ridiculous boosts to their defences? You are telling me that the stonemason European Civs with their star forts and stone masonry are worse at fortifications than people in the Sahel with adobe and wooden buildings?

It hadn't been wrapped, simply carried in a grocery bag. Looking back, I suspect he had quickly grabbed it on his way over, but that's alright. Because it was *perfect*. After all, I had been playing my father's copies of Age of Empires 1 and 2 for quite some time before that, and was quite the fan as one could guess. Of course, it turned out that the game was to powerful to run on either my or my father's computers, so I ended up having to wait what felt like an eternity to finally be able to play the game(though it was probably closer to a month). During that time, I constantly read through the manual that game with the game, pouring over every single detail. Until finally, the day(and more importantly, the new graphics card)arrived. So, we began the installation process, installing the game using the FOUR SEPARATE DISCS. I know, disgusting huh? Anyway, I finally got to play the game, and let's just say that if Steam were able to log my hours back then, I'd probably have a time played in the multiple thousands.

What's great: new civs, maps, campaigns, and smarter AI enemies - they can quickly form a comprehensive army, and micro manage each individual soldier in the battlefield.

What's to be improved: the game looks to lag behind (even compared to the original AoE3 10y+ ago) on the optimization on basic operations. Units are much more likely to be unable to find a path; artillery doesn't deploy upon enemies; units make confusing moves e.g. chasing running away enemies instead of attacking nearby units. This, combined with smarter enemies, makes the game much harder for me personally. I didn't have such experience with the original AoE3.

I am really looking forward to seeing the developers to keep improving the basic gaming experience - being defeated not by smart enemy but by confusing unit behavior is disappointing. Anyway I am giving a thumbs up.",1634710175,1634710175,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As for the Definitive Edition:

Pros:

-Improved graphics (that is handles larger resolutions and multiple monitors, the graphical elements are improved, and allows for better camera scrolling in and out.)

-there are a few more maps and some new catagories of maps

Cons:

- All cards are unlocked when you start a new home city (player) which means there isn't much to play for in terms of levels. It could have been easy enough to make this only a feature for multiplayer or just make it optional.

- There is a collection of maps labelled ""Naval Maps"" which only have strips of water, often a thin slice of coast on the side, which doesn't offer much opportunity for real naval battles. 

- Difficulty jumps are dramatic on the low end. Going from Standard to Moderate is like going from playing an AFK player to playing someone who is really aggressive by comparison.

This is not as intrusive as some players portray it though, and honestly doesn't make a major difference.

That being said, this is a good remaster and pretty much a direct upgrade over original. The visual boost is self explanatory, albeit some changes I disliked - mainly the increased contrast and saturation.

A welcome change was improvements to UI (cleaner and with higher resolution), AI (first thing I noticed is that AI now uses 'hit-and-run' tactics with ranged cavalry) and Skirmish settings (ability to have more than 2 teams, for example). And of course there's tons of small flavor and details that enrich the immersion.

Short answer: [h1]YES![/h1]
Long answer:[/b]

[h1]The Age of Exploration[/h1] (also called the Age of Discovery) began in the 1400s and continued through the 1600s. It was a period of time when the European nations began exploring the world. They discovered new routes to India, much of the Far East, and the Americas. The Age of Exploration took place at the same time as the Renaissance. 

[h1]Why explore?[/h1]
Outfitting an expedition could be expensive and risky. Many ships never returned. So why did the Europeans want to explore? The simple answer is money. Although, some individual explorers wanted to gain fame or experience adventure, the main purpose of an expedition was to make money.

[h1]How did expeditions make money?[/h1]
Expeditions made money primarily by discovering new trade routes for their nations. When the Ottoman Empire captured Constantinople in 1453, many existing trade routes to India and China were shut down. These trade routes were very valuable as they brought in expensive products such as spices and silk. New expeditions tried to discover oceangoing routes to India and the Far East. Some expeditions became rich by discovering gold and silver, such as the expeditions of the Spanish to the Americas. They also found new land where colonies could be established and crops such as sugar, cotton, and tobacco could be grown.  

[h1]Henry the Navigator[/h1]
The Age of Exploration began in the nation of Portugal under the leadership of Henry the Navigator. Henry sent out ships to map and explore the west coast of Africa. They went further south than any previous European expedition and mapped much of western Africa for the Portuguese. In 1488, Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias was the first European to sail around the southern tip of Africa and into the Indian Ocean.

[h1]Christopher Columbus[/h1]
Soon the Spanish wanted to find a trade route to the Far East. Explorer Christopher Columbus thought that he could sail west, across the Atlantic Ocean, to China. He could not get the Portuguese to fund his expedition, so he went to the Spanish. Spanish monarchs Isabella and Ferdinand agreed to pay for Columbus' trip. In 1492 Columbus discovered the New World of the Americas.

[h1]Portugal and Spain[/h1]
Portugal and Spain became the early leaders in the Age of Exploration. Through the Treaty of Tordesillas the two countries agreed to divide up the New World. Spain got most of the Americas while Portugal got Brazil, India, and Asia.  Spain sent over conquistadors to explore the Americas and to conquer the peoples there. Hernan Cortes conquered the Aztec Empire in Mexico and Francisco Pizarro conquered the Inca Empire in Peru. They made Spain rich with the gold and silver they found in the Americas.Portugal sent out Vasco da Gama who found a trade route around the southern tip of Africa and to India. They also explored much of the Far East and were the first Europeans to establish a trading colony in China at Macau.

[h1]Colonies[/h1]
Other countries such as Great Britain and the Netherlands established colonies in the New World. Eventually Great Britain would surpass all of the European nations in terms of the size of their world wide empire including the thirteen colonies in the Americas that later became the United States.

[h1]Geography[/h1]
The Age of Exploration was one of the most important times in the history of world geography. A significant portion of the unknown world was mapped during this short period. Also, many advances were made in navigation and mapping which helped future explorers and travelers...

I was as I remembered, just prettier.
II was awful. I never played the original and thought II would the same as I. I was wrong. Instead of starting with a village, each scenario seems to start with you controlling a few soldiers and trying to find a village. It's more like an low budget RPG than an RTS.
