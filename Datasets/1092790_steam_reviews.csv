First off, if you love card builders, you'll love the game.
If you're a fan of games that go in unexpected directions, you'll love this game.

If you're someone like me who isnt into the card games-milage may vary. I mean don't get me wrong, it is correct when you hear things like ""you dont have to know card builder games to enjoy it""....well yes......but then no.  The game is divided into acts. The first act really is a great way to get someone introduced into deck building, and its my favorite act. 

The other acts-esp second-really introduce new mechanics and stuff that arent covered in act one, and doesn't hand hold. Plus its....different. I am saying little as it is true that the less you know going into the game the better. But I wasnt a fan of the other acts as much as first one, and while the surprises and twists were cool....it just fell off for me. 

Its also relatively short-I was under impression it would be longer after 1st act, but rest of game kind of just goes by quickly. Id love to see a whole game like act 1 with the theming and the puzzles/storytelling mix. 

If you like cardbuilders and/or really weird games that go in unexpected directions storywise, then youll like this. Otherwise, milage will vary. I do recommend it, but would advise getting it on sale for those unsure",1708723598,1708723598,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you have played any of Daniel Mullins' GameJam games, you'll probably be familiar with like 1/10th of this whole concept. If you have played the following games: Magic, Yu Gi oh, Hearthstone, and The Pokemon Trading Card Game; you'll see a lot of references and tributes to those game even within the game mechanics shown. In otherwords: you'll be at home.

Inscryption is not afraid to break walls to a point where YOU the PLAYER can break the 4th wall yourself... ok kind of.. look its hard to explain everything that goes on in the room but 20$ will give you enough to keep you searching for clues so you can understand what I mean. Once you get even more curious, the game unfolds itself to where things get crazy. why would I put it like that?... well if you were to make it to the credits a mode is unlocked that TRULY fits the Roguelike genre... but then it gives a little more info that may.. ok if you beat the extra mode, just watch MattPatt's video explaining the secrets of the game itself. 
No? you don't want to? you want to solve this whole cracked mystery yourself? well good luck! I hope you like going outside!

Daniel Mullins created a Masterpiece that keeps breaking so many boundaries of Game dev relations with the player. Hell, after I finished streamed Inscryption I went back for more. Learned something new every time I came back.

Being familiar with the dev's previous works, I expected some level of experimental genre breaking, but I was a little disappointed to find out that the most heavily marketed part of the game was only a small part of the game, as it felt the most engaging and fleshed out. While the rest of the game makes sense on a conceptual level, the gameplay and immersion took a hit afterwards.

I wish I could talk about the experience with this game but I want to spoil absolutely nothing. I usually dive into games blindly anyways but I cannot stress this enough that the less you know about this game, the better the experience. The reviews speak for themselves, and as much as you might have the urge to quit or search something up, just keep pushing. I promise you, patience is rewarded. Only thing I will say is that you could search up how to solve certain puzzles but i'm only saying this as a last last resort and after you've spent many hours stuck on that one puzzle. The average play time is 12 hours so unless you're pushing 18 hours and still have not finished is when I'd probably look at a guide. And remember, this game is quite difficult and you will get frustrated but like all things in life, there is no joy without pain, think of it like a dark souls game. This is such a beautiful game and I truly believe it is a must have in everyone's library. I only wish I could erase my memories of this game to experience it again. 

(related to this from another reviewer so I wanted to add this in my own review too. Its the only problem I had with this game)
""- It‚Äôs almost too deep. I get the feeling that without joining the Discord, taking part in the ARGs and watching Youtube videos I will never really fully understand this game or at the very least see everything that it has to offer. I wish I had the time to delve into every little facet of the game and discover it all for myself but I don‚Äôt. And this makes me sad."" - Sigmar's Sausage.

100% Suggest going in blind (WITHOUT getting help at all thru the whole game), makes it 10x better.

Top-notch game, great story, I was really invested in it, took me 12 hours-ish maybe 11 give or take due to afk. (Never got boring either!)
The deck building aspect was amazing- the way they introduce it, teach it, all the different things you can do to your deck, probably the most fun card game I have ever played. Loved it the whole way!
Plethora of things to do than just play cards! (and secrets to find!)
Lots of cool mechanics you wouldn't expect!

I think the best part of the game is whenever I think I know what going on, i'm invested in the story but then a curve-ball shoots and boom whole new perspective! Keeps it interesting like I mentioned before (always changing it up too!)

Phenomenally made game, definitely a genius behind the screen that made this game.

So much to say,
So much to praise, but not before,
All the aspects, given away. 


I would love to write so much more but it's troubling without giving away spoilers! Trust me on this: do not spoil the game.

Without spoilers, this is a very well built card game meant to exercise your neurons with strategies and tactics that force you to think outside the box. Do you wanna doomstack a card? You can do that. Do you want to populate the board with spam? You can do that. The items are excellent battle aids without being so necessary you MUST have them. There are a LOT of ways to play a deck and the randomized nature of what you get makes it a new trip every time.

There's a story to this game. It's really good, kinda campy but in a really cute way that works super well. It's the kind of thing you can easily enjoy. The characters too, although I won't go too far into it.

What sets Inscryption apart is that, on top of narrative shenanigans, the core card battling gameplay loop is pretty darn good. There aren't many deck archetypes (take your pick of midrange or aggro), but there are so many interesting mechanics and resources that can be bent in fun ways. That solid gameplay combined with metafiction framing and a hefty amount of polish leads to a truly intoxicating introduction. The back half of Inscryption is less stunning, but the strong metafictional twists help keep the gameplay fresh and the narrative intriguing.

If you've played previous Daniel Mullins Games titles, you'll likely have an idea of if you'll enjoy the narrative part of the game, but in case you haven't, it's a type of story where the less you know, the better. Do note that there are some fairly creepy elements to it, so if you don't like scary stories, that's going to make it harder to enjoy this one.

As for the gameplay, it is a fairly competent roguelike deckbuilder / cardgame.
Compared to Pony Island you can tell that the developer has improved a lot in both gameplay (I found Pony Island to be a bit slow and easy in gameplay) and narrative (less repeated dialogue in this one, plus a more interesting story overall).

There's a lot to talk about with this game, but the more you know the less novel the experience will be.

Discovering the amazing secrets that masterpiece of a game holds is such a good feeling. If you're  thinking about buying you this game, DO IT! just GO IN BLIND, honestly this game's secrets are so good you just have to experience them for yourself. No and I mean NO amount of talking can ever get the point I'm trying to make across. just go in BLIND!!!

Without spoiling anything, the ending did leave some questions opened, but then a new mode unlocks after beating the game. Playing this mode to completion fills in most of those questions through journal logs. 

With the constant bad, glitchy, unoptimized AAA games releasing every year, with insane price increases and DLC, it's so wonderful to see a solid, FULL release game, with no micro transactions. I have will over 100 hours of play, cause I ended up buying a physical for PS5 and playing fully through there as well.

If you're into card games like Yu-Gi-Oh and Magic the Gathering, this will be another that will get you addicted. The indie movie cutscenes were well done and really gave a creepy vibe, making me more invested on what was going to happen next.

ACT 1 is where your usual card deck builder game starts, and its pretty fun. theres also puzzles that are hinted at by the living cards which gives you cards/items in your play. its very well designed, each icon on the map is a different event and you go through them to get to the boss, and beat it for the next area. if you havent died and still have two candles lit in said area, leshy will give you a free smoke card which can be easily sacrificed for other cards... an upgrade to the smoke card even makes the smoke and actual useful attacking card which is amazing! each boss is unique and has different weaknesses. this part of the game can be summed up in one word and it is experimentation. combine dupe cards for broken cards, add sigils onto already OP cards and so on. leshy is cheating already so why not you cheat also? my only complaint about this act is the over reliance on the permadeath mechanic. you HAVE to die a few times before getting to the next area, i wouldnt mind this because if you die, you are able to create a deathcard. a death card is a card where you choose its own stats so if you had OP cards in your deck before, theres a chance you could make another OP card. my complain with the permadeath mechanic is the demoralizing rubberbanding. you CANNOT win on your first try. the game will throw unfair fights to you so that you will die. its possible to overcome but for newer players, its very demoralizing and could lead to abandoning the game. i definitely recommend playing it through, the rewarding finish is worth it! 
ACT 2
ACT 2 is simply AMAZING. i was in awe about what david mullins did with this part. act 2 plays like an old SNES RPG. you have an overworld and in the overworld theres 4 different locations you can explore with 4 different inscryption scrybes. at first you can only beat leshy or the necromancer witch and each of those scrybe areas you will be challenged by the people there and solving puzzles. from taking pictures to fighting skeletons and writing obituaries on them. the P03 area and the magician area is also filled with fun characters and good fights. the cards play a bit different here too. at the start of the game, you will be able to choose cards decks you will main. there are 4 card decks which are robot, necromancer, animals and mages. instead of getting cards from a trader, you get cards from card packs. each enemy you fight will give you one or two card packs which could give you up to 5 cards. these cards also work with the 4 main decks of act 2. robot deck with batteries, mage deck with something, leshys deck with squirrels and necromancer deck with bones. you also make your own decks! you can have a hybrid of leshys and nercomancer decks to create an amazing deck for every enemy or try something different with mage decks or robot decks. this part of the game can be summed up in one word which is FUN. this part of the game wasnt frustrating and the abundance of card packs let players choose there ways to fight. this part of the game also doesnt rely too much on RNG. even if it you have a bad hand, you could always reroll with a nice clover. its very welcoming and doesnt put a toll on the player. now to the weakest part of the game
ACT 3 
ACT 3 has a very interesting premise. after being glitched out by P03, he now takes over the board. you will travel in botopia on the game board and as always, beat the bosses and do the great trancendence. i havent finished this part, but it definitely feels the weakest. it relies a LOT of RNG and battery recharges. you only get a battery per turn and most damaging cards use around 2 - 4 batteries so at one point, you HAVE to tank damage and you wont know whats coming. coming off of act 2's very nice rerolling mechanic, this one definitely feels the most unfair out of them all. sometimes you cant even move and you will just die, its insane. i dont like this part but there are some stuff i kind of like. i like botopia, its a nice setting. the dark factory also gives a very good atmosphere to this act and the money mechanic is very cool! theres a hub centre and a shop where you can buy upgrades using money. unlike previous acts where money/teeth are basically useless, this act encourages you to spend tons of your money. personally, i think this part is fine but theres probably a few ways to make it more welcoming like act 2 with a reroll mechanic, faster battery recharges (if your deck has a ton of 2 - 4 battery cost cards) and less unfair fights. 
OVERALL (so far)
this game is very good, sometimes its demoralizing but most of the times its very fun and encourages experimentation. the story is also very good and i liked the FMV style sequence every few bosses or so that tells the story of the character were playing as, which is a dude whos playing the inscryption game. i like this game, id recommend it to everybody whos looking for a fun card game.",1707496989,1707496989,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm not big on card games, I think they're enjoyable & fun but they're not my favorite and I don't play them very often, so when I grabbed Inscryption I was a little bit mixed on what I expected, and I was pleasantly surprised. The card game you play is very fun & just makes you want to win, and failure only pushes you to win even more.

Inscryption is very eerie and mysterious, you get dropped in with not much context but trust me, there is some story & lore here, it is extremely interesting and makes you want to learn more about what this game truly is, and it's origins. This game truly is more than what you see on the store page, much much more.

This game has become one of my favorites ever I think, which is not what I'd expected when I picked it up. I expected it to be a somewhat fun game that I'd play and forget about, but no, this game is tons of fun, very interesting and has definitely found itself as one of my favorite games ever. I'm not sure if anyone else would share this opinion with me, I'm unsure if many people would name this game as one of their favorites, but it's definitely one of mine. It just amazed me around every corner.

This game is definitely one you must go into blind, as the genuine mystery around [i] everything [/i] in this game is great. The game presents itself as a simple creepy card game in a dark cabin, but there's much more to this game, believe me. Please play it. Daniel Mullins & everyone involved really cooked up something good with this one. I may be 2 years late, but I'm glad I got around to it. I love it.

I definitely recommend this game. Play it, and succeed in your goal. Just... be careful with that Stoat card... something about it...",1707296570,1707296663,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This was the first game of his that I ever played, so I was expecting the whole thing to be like the first section.  Unfortunately that's the best section, and if that was the only section it'd be a great game, so I'm going to have to still call it a great game.  The other 3 sections are still okay, they're just not nearly as good.   The drop in strategy is actually very severe too until Kaycee's Mod, when the game's story is already over.  That's not so bad though, b/c the story will have you rushing through sections 2-4 out of curiosity, you might not even realize how bad the gameplay nosedived.  Those sections are short anyway.  The story also makes it worthwhile, which you could guess if you played Pony Island or the Hex.

It does a lot of different things that break the normal ""rules"" of gaming in order to draw the player in. One simple example that also presents in other games is the title/settings screen being incorporated into the game. Instead of a blue transparent ui box popping up when you press escape, it is part of the lore of the game itself so that immersion is not broken. Inscryption does this on many occasions so much so that the rules of the game and reality are blended which lends to a more entertaining game and story.

The story itself is very interesting and falls in line with other Daniel Mullins' games. It is more interesting to go in blind with no preconceptions towards what is or could be going on. Initially, the game presents itself as a simple card game, yet as it continues it is obvious that something strange is happening.

One of the strongest points of Inscryption is the card game. I'd say Inscryption is a story first and a card game second. Unfortunately this means there really isn't enough of gameplay to be had. There is a good amount, but nothing close to other titles that solely focus on gameplay. I'd love to see a Slay the Spire inspired Inscryption spinoff that adds more card game elements with longer fights and increased complexity. The game still stands as a unique experience by itself. Highly recommend if you like card games, piecing together stories and spooky atmosphere.",1707110833,1707110833,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Inscryption disappointed me 1stly because I had relatively high expectations about it after reading many times that we should play it knowing nothing about it.

Actually, I don't think knowing in advance what it is about changes a lot the experience so this review will contain important [b][i]spoilers[/i][/b], but I won't get into any detail of the surprises so you'll still have fun playing the game if it's your cup of tea. :-)

[h1]üßê My Opinion üßê[/h1]
So the game is articulated in 3 chapters. The 1st one is by far the best because of its incredible atmosphere: we're trapped in a cabin in the woods, forced to play a card game with a mysterious character, and we don't understand much about what's going on exactly.

After that, it's kinda a downhill experience. First, the card game isn't great; we're forced to lose on several occasions to trigger some events, which is ok-ish, but then once this is done, we're left with games whose results mostly depend on luck: you have 8~10 cards in your deck, but start each game with only 4 chosen randomly; usually, not all your cards have the same strength, so you can start with 4 cards letting you win in 1 or 2 turns, or the opposite, losing in 1 or 2 turns.

This was very painful, so I save-scummed (by manually copying the file on the HD), so I could reach the end of the 1st chapter without too many tries.

Once done, you get to see some videos explaining the story a bit.

Then in Chapter 2, you get to play an 8-bit version of the game; the deck building this time makes a bit more sense, but you quickly get indestructible as the strategy overall is pretty basic for a hardcore gamer like myself.

This 2nd chapter is a bit long and gets somewhat tedious and repetitive.

Once you beat it, you get more videos to watch to discover the story, and then you come back to something relatively similar to the 1st chapter, but again with a better deck building, which leads again to the same issue: too easy & repetitive.

And then it's done, but it feels incomplete and kinda dumb. To understand what was missing, I had to read this: https://www.gamespot.com/articles/inscryption-ending-explained-arg-secrets-and-whats-going-on-in-the-story/1100-6497568/ . TL/DR: there's an Alternate reality game (ARG) that will lead you to the real ending: an unlisted video on YouTube (it felt very strange to read the excited comments under this video). It's still very rough and kinda dull, but at least you get the complete story.

So all in all, I didn't have much fun playing Inscryption, both on the core gameplay (the card game) and the obscure story & story-telling.

Thus said, the game is obviously well crafted for what it is and its author poured his heart into it.

It took me a bit more than 15 hours to beat the game.

[h1]üíñ Pros üíñ[/h1]
- Unique atmosphere in the 1st chapter, full of mystery
- Some quirks & well-thought weird things
- The ending feels tragic (if you forget how dumb is the premise, or if you really don't know how computers work)

[h1]üíÄ Cons üíÄ[/h1]
- No difficulty level: for hardcore gamers, it's 95% too easy, and for casual gamers, it might be a lot to take
- In the 1st chapter, the card game is too much luck-based
- In the next chapters, the card game seriously lacks strategic depth, as well as variations so it gets kinda repetitive
- The story-telling doesn't make much sense, as it mixes the points of view in an obfuscated manner
- The story is actually pretty basic once unobfuscated",1706879424,1706879648,False,5,0,0.50027012825012207,0,True,False,False

This is easily one of the best games I've played. I'm usually not much of a card game guy but i had an insane amount of fun with this game, the story is amazing and the gameplay only enhances the experience.

The characters in this game are great and the ending is one of the best game endings I have ever experienced, though I wont say anything more than that regarding the story.

As I've already said, the gameplay is great. The base mechanics are easy to understand and as the game goes on it smoothly introduces you to more mechanics without making it feel like an information overload. There are items like the pliers that can let you tip the scales in your favor, but aren't so strong as to make them feel overpowered. There are some points where it feels unfair, but this is a roguelike, so that is expected. Whenever you die it is simply a learning experience and beating the difficult battles feels extremely rewarding.

A roguelite CCG that was also a puzzle room? A dark mysterious story and tone? What's not to love? After playing through the entirety of the story mode as well reaching level 12 and doing the optional boss of Kaycees mod, however, there is unfortunately a lot not to love about inscryption, with my personal problems mostly having to do with the difficulty and the narrative. 

My difficulty problem is that the game is too easy, both in the puzzle sections and the card game sections in the story portion of the game. The first section of the game, the only truly rogue like portion of the campaign, is easily beatable in your first 4 or 5 runs and 2-3 hours. The other sections of the game are even easier, and each took me an hour or two at most. The CCG sections are very easy to break, with turn one kills being very easy to achieve in most stages of the game. As for the puzzles, answers either directly given to you, or solutions were so simple I was able to accidentally brute force them while trying to figure out the rules to the puzzle in question. 

Kaycees mod is a supposedly better balanced rogulike mode available after completing the story, sort of like NG+. It has slightly better difficulty, with adjustable difficulty settings and fewer puzzles. In this mode however, the game is hurt by aesthetic choices made for the story mode, with the first person, point and click controls that were made to be immersive and creepy in the story mode becoming constrictive and awkward once you have to do many runs in quick succession, with many of the puzzle elements they were designed to support removed. Kaycees mod is also, unfortunately, still very unbalanced. Where the base game rogue-like portion could be beaten easily by creating an unstoppable boss monster with the custom card mechanics, the optimal way to beat Kaycees mod is to beeline for one of Inscryptions many infinite combos then click a lot to find a victory. These combos are arguably even easier to find and enable in Kaycees mod, with new cards that seem designed to support uninteractive, combo heavy gameplay.

If the game was just easy, I wouldn't have a problem with it. I've played walking sims before with little to no challenge and have enjoyed them, but without going into spoilers, a significant part of inscriptions narrative and tone hinges around you being an underdog, trapped in some dire circumstance at the whims of an all powerful being. Unfortunately the game is so easy that you never feel that way, you're almost always bulldozing through encounters, only facing challenge when the game actively cheats, or changes the rules of the game fundamentally in a way you haven't encountered yet. You feel more like you're kicking a puppy than engaging in a battle of wits against a dark mastermind. The game also gets very meta, and without spoilers it gets meta in a way that I personally didn't like, I found it very intrusive and uncomfortable in a way that was probably intentional, but wasn't fun in any way shape or form.

To this review I will add a caveat. I've been avoiding spoilers in this review because I played Inscryption partially spoiled, and I think this may have soured my game-play experience somewhat. Inscryption's story is very meta, and relies heavily on creepy-pasta aesthetics and shocking twists for it's impact. Even knowing a rough outline of the game before jumping in was enough to suck all of the interest out of the genuinely engaging story decisions this game made, and ideas it explored. Unable to engage with the story, my focus was drawn much more to the game-play, which I disliked for the decidedly subjective, difficulty reasons mentioned earlier. The game-play didn't really hit it's stride for me until Kaycees mod, 10+ hours into a game I found myself struggling to enjoy. Even then, Kaycees mod can be made a tedious experience by design decisions made for to support the atmosphere of the main story mode, and while discovering infinite combos and turn one kill interactions can be fun, once you've found them that's it, your roguelike experience is now finding the easiest ways to execute your fastest infinite.

Given the plethora of other positive reviews for this game it is very likely you will like Inscryption. It does some genuinely clever things with narrative and genre and despite my complaints has solid core card gameplay. If you haven't been spoiled on the story and the game sounds interesting you should probably give it as shot. My negative recommendation is very personal. I'm not that in to creepy pasta as a genre, I don't particularly like meta fiction, and I am a puzzle game and CCG fiend. I found this game easy after spending thousands of hours on MTG. Gwent, Hearthstone and LOR, and played it immediately after playing The Witness, a very hard puzzle game which I likely subconsciously compared it to. If any of that sounds like you, I'd wait for mega sale.",1671273878,1706731317,False,6,2,0.540291130542755127,0,True,False,False

The game does peak in the first chapter, as the immersion of it all just draws you in deeper to uncover what is going on within Inscryption. And of course, Leshy as a storyteller of sorts, with the low rumble each time he speaks, his eyes glowing in the darkness, only for him to wear a mask and give off a completely different energy in the boss fights, it's simply phenomenal.
The rest of the game is still fantastic in many ways, especially gameplay wise. And the visual quality of the first chapter can still be seen in the third. I especially love the personality and design of the game's real antagonist [spoiler](P03)[/spoiler].
And of course, the ending is an absolute spectacle. [spoiler]Lore stuff aside, the way it all crumbles apart is awesome.

For what seems to be a pretty straightforward title, you'll discover a story deeper than you could ever imagine. I'll be breaking down everything that makes this game so great, even though it also has its minor downsides.

[b] Pros [/b]
[list]
[*] For starters, just like I mentioned nearly two lines ago, I think this is one (if not [i] the one[/i]) of the best story I've experienced in my life. Not just in video games. EVER. The reason why it's so good is because you'll never expect this kind of effort from a storytelling perspective for a card battler. I cannot explain anything without spoiling something, the game as a whole is a spoiler, so you'll have to trust me on this one. DO NOT GO ONLINE TO SPOIL YOURSELF! Inscryption cannot be experienced twice. Once you know what happens, you'll lose interest.
[*] The overall audiovisual characteristics of the game are off the charts. A retro-like game never appealed me so much from a video perspective. The art style is creepy and efficient, there's borderline horrific elements, I felt pressured into playing certain cards on occasion, etc. The sound effects and the soundtrack that accompanies it all is just the cherry on top. You'll feel immersed on a whole new level.
[*] The AI is tough, but fair. Expect to die a lot and restart a lot. It sounds a lot more frustrating than it actually is, because when you die, you'll get a chance to dive deeper into the story and discover new aspects the game has to offer.
[*] The performances are great, and pretty much any rig, even low-end, can run this game without expecting serious issues. It's a very stable game, and I've never encountered a bug once.
[*] Just like I said earlier, I'm usually not a fan of card battlers, but this one is done right. You start off very simple but add a lot of depth to your deckbuilding experience, and the game transitions those new elements very smoothly. You end up with a lot of options without feeling overwhelmed, which I particularly enjoyed.
[*] It took me around 15 hours to finish the main campaign, without touching the extras or replaying it. I've found that to be the perfect length to keep me intrigued while not cutting it too short nor dragging it for too long. [/list]

[b] Neutrals [/b]
[list]
[*] It can get a tiny bit repetitive, especially depending your learning curve. Once you finish the game, you can access a lot of extra content, and it took me a while to get to it because I got burned out of the gameplay after finishing the campaign. I recently got back to it, and I thoroughly enjoyed fully completing it. I've put this point in [i]Neutrals[/i] because I think the repetitiveness comes after completing the campaign, which is where most people will stop playing it. [/list]

[b] Cons [/b]
[list]
[*] A major downside of this game is that, well, it starts off too perfect. I won't explain too much to avoid any spoilers, but the first couple hours into the game are so enjoyable that when you reach a certain point, you'll feel a little slacking off. This doesn't mean this certain part of the game isn't good, on the contrary, I still liked it, but I was kind of disappointed of what it was turning into compared to the beginning. Thankfully, the endgame makes up for it, so it isn't a downward slope from the beginning to the end.
[*] A more specific complaint is that the game cannot be experienced twice. Your first time is unique. So if you've been spoiled in any way, or if you've watched a gameplay on YouTube to find out what the hype is all about, you probably know at this point that you won't enjoy it as much as someone who goes in completely blind. [/list]

[b] TL;DR [/b]
If this game interests you the slightest, buy it. You won't regret it, even at full price. I cannot say it is a perfect game, but I assure you that it comes close for most. You don't need to enjoy card battlers, roguelikes or deckbuilders to have fun. You only need to crave a rich story from where you expect it the less to be. Shout out to the solo developer behind this masterpiece!

What I thought I bought was what I could see in the videos and pictures of the shop page and what I'd seen on YouTube before. Apparently, this was only ""act 1"" after which the style completely changed. I didn't buy this game for its visuals alone, but this mix of 3D-puzzle and cardbattler with its, let's call it forked minimap was what I thought this game would be to the end. But act 2 changed the artstyle, went from 3D to 2D/isometric, you could run around where ever you want... act 3 brought back some of the good things from act 1. But still, act 2 and act 3 didn't feel enjoyable at all. I quit and uninstalled the game, when I knew what was happening. After a long time I picked it back up again to restart the game, so I could simply play act 1 again. To my surprise the ""restart"" began at act 2 all the time. Still, I fought through act 2 and 3 which took a lot of unfullfilling hours. More than I thought. In the end I didn't care for the story anymore. Then, finally, I got to the end and unlocked ""Kayceys Mod"" which itself was everything I thought the game itself would be. Roguelite, 3D puzzle, cardbattler, forked minimap (like act 1, not act 3) and so on. But act 2 and 3 ruined the game for me. I can't enjoy this game anymore, not even the ""mod"" which makes me sad, because it was completely unnecessary. If only there was something on the storepage showing that most of the game isn't actually anything like act 1. If you scroll all the way through the media in the store page, there is a video with a 2 second clip showing something other than act 1. Out of 4 minutes of video and half a dozen pictures. Not only the artstyle, but the gameplay itself changed so drastically, that not showing this on the storepage this isn't even ""preventing spoilers"" anymore, but feels like straight out lying. That is a behavior I do not condone.
If the dev was more honest regarding what this game was like, I whouldn't have bought it, but would understand people praising it because of its artistic value.
If the dev had kept the content of the game limited to ""Kayceys Mod"" that whould have been way better for me and it would have been a garantied ""recommended"" from me.

Gameplay, fantastic.
It‚Äôs multiple art-styles are pretty good too!
The storytelling is fitting with only one paradox but it gets the job done to prepare the player for the next act.
Despite the act 1-3 being pretty replayable by themselves, the existence of a postgame after the story is AMAZING.

You can also throw all your problems in a fire!

love the game, im only going to talk about act1 since that's my fav part.
(the other parts aren't bad, i just like act 1 the most)

i love the concept of a rpg game combined with cards and this game just nails it. the setting, the gameplay and the story are actually well made. the art style fits well and the audio just puts the cherry on top.
also the puzzles are fun to do and not that hard.
the endless mode is a god tier expansion that just makes me feel warm inside :3

Act 1 used to be my favorite, I mean it had it all. It was charming, it looked great, it made me question everything in the game and I loved the experience personally.

Act 2, however, personally took the rating down a lot for me. It took the fun and joy from Act 1 and ruined it by changing the clever mechanics the first act had and making you play what seemed like a completely different game. It was not fun, and I was almost ready to quit altogether, but I stuck through, and I don't regret it.

Act 3, without giving any spoilers, is like Act 1, but with new sigils and new mechanics that, honestly, made me like it a lot. I'd go as far as to say I personally enjoyed it as much, if not more than Act 1. I don't know if others feel this way, but I do. I enjoyed it a lot.

For a general review, I'd give this game 3/5: fun but dragged down by the middle of the game. Don't read ahead if you wanna go in blind.



The game is kinda split up into 5 acts(including the bonus content): Each act completely shifts the game. I'll try to explain the ups and downs of each act then give a general review of the game given that.

Act 1(first 3-8 hours or so)
Act 1 is the experience advertised on the store screen and is a very fleshed out deck builder rogue-lite. Though it can start a little bit slow(barely) it's overall really enjoyable and kept me entertained for most of it. 

Act 2(follow up 1-2 hours or so)
At first act 2 felt really crazy however I quickly realized how much worse it was from act 1. All of the intensity and strategy from act 1 was just kinda thrown out a window. All the rogue-lite elements were also gone. It may not seem like that big of a deal since it was only a few hours, but I dreaded this act and was just kinda infuriated with how boring it felt. I think I would've appreciated this act more if it was after act 3 as more of a optional bonus section, but throughout all of act 2 I was just in a rush to finish this section to get to the next ""fun"" section.

Act 3(follow up 4-6 hours or so)
When I first got into act 3 I was pretty hyped at first, but my excitement died quick. Act 3 was more similar to act 1, but instead of being a rogue-lite deck builder it was a campaign esc card builder: It was better than act. On top of that, the way you got out cards in this act was just flat out boring. Act 3 turned your side deck from a useful pile of fuel(essentially) to a worthless pile of garbage that doesn't do anything. The part that annoys me about this is that later in this act they introduce 2 ways to make the side deck actually somewhat useful, but by the time they do this you only have an hour or 2 left of the act. Both of these upgrades are awesome, but they introduce new mechanics way to late. Since this isn't a rogue-lite anymore you can't build around the mechanics of these upgrades very much. I think this act did have some awesome mechanics though. The boss fights weren't difficult, but they had really interesting mechanics(still not enough to compensate for the rest the act). If the late act upgrades were always there and it kept the rogue-lite elements of act 1 I think I would've really enjoyed act 3, but I was just really disappointed in this act.

Act 4(follow up 30 minutes or so)(barely an act)
This act was very cool and brief, but kinda made me more disappointed. Act 2 introduced the potential for four separate proper acts(2 of which were done in act 1 and act 3). Act 4 disappointed me because the final 2 potential acts were just kinda jammed in act 4 very briefly.

Act 5(bonus content kinda)(as long as you like or about 10+ hours for 100% achievements)
Act 5 is this games redemption. Act 5 simply takes the strongest part of the game(act 1) and revamps it to be much more re-playable. 

Overall I do still think this game is worth it just for acts 1 and 5(and because doing all the achievements is pretty fun), but wow this game disappointed me many times. The most annoying part about this game for me is that I would've enjoyed acts 2 & 3 if they were just slightly revamped. It's cool to have a game that's so willing to switch it up like this one, but it just wasn't done that well",1706060670,1706060670,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Basically the custom game mode of the first part of the game. 
Incredibly addicting.

Outside of that, the story and main game is great fun to playthrough.
The game perfectly balances lore mystery with gameplay.
Not only are you looking for clues outside of the card battles, you're also actively trying to trigger certain events during cardplay.

I usually dont care for long games because I dont think the longevity of a game determines if the game is deemed ""good"" but rather by what the game has to offer and how well crafted the game was made and holy hell is this game well made. This game is made for both seasonal Card players and people that don't play card games at all! it is so well crafted that a person like myself, someone that is not into card games, wanted more and more the longer I played. The story telling of this game is incredible and its aided by the characters in the game! The way how the game introduces new mechanics and then includes them right after you learned it, is so magnificent! [spoiler]Its so amazing how in the 2D section all play styles are combined while in the 3D is more catered to the scrybe and they add their own rules.[/spoiler] Even if you forget what something does, It included a QOL that can just remind you what it is by a simple click, so you wont need to worry about looking it up or spending time reading rules or anything! The way all these different genres of games blend together into one package is honestly so impressive and never in my life would I thought a game can blend this well and be so fun and addicting to play. The game has great atmosphere as well with the music and environment, which aids a lot to the story of the game [spoiler] I know a lot of people Enjoyed the first Act of the game more than the Third because Leshy is a great storyteller and role player at that! but I thought it was so genius on how P03 was a complete contrast! That was the whole point! He is a lifeless robot that is focused on min maxing the Game play of the card game and thinks storytelling is not important, the best way to see it is like if P03 was the big corporations making triple A games for money and Leshy was the Indie dev that actually cared about the presentation of their game. Even the music for that section matched the atmosphere of where you play (a lifeless factory) and the character you're up against (a lifeless robot)[/spoiler] By the time I was at the end and done with the game I said out loud ""Thats it?"" because I wanted so much more! It got me craving for more content and I Really hope Daniel Mullins makes DLC for this game, I dont even care if I have to pay for it, this game deserves every penny. [spoiler]Seriously! when I beat P03 I thought I was going to be able to go back to the islands and pick a new Scrybe! I was trying to get through it quick for that reason, I wanted to see the other 2 in the 3D setting! I thought it would play out something like the island expand a bit and you have to fight a few more new people in each region, then get a new scrybe into power and I was so dissapointed that it didnt happen, instead we got a teaser of what Grimora would of looked like as well as Magnificus, and I would of absoltuely enjoyed a Yu-Gi-Oh arena style with him. Not only that but the 2D section could of had so much more as well, there's a whole seperate way to play on that Act that I kept thinking of it as a stand alone game.[/spoiler]

The Story is told in a really interesting way and i really love the creativity behind the whole story with it being told in both an ARG and sentient game way. The characters and world building that are done here are also really well mastered and had me really immersed. 

The Settings that you go through are well crafted and never made the game go stale from repetition. Each area you go through has its own personality and aesthetic that are as great as the last. 

Visually, its entrancing. Performance was perfectly fine with there being no bugs or glitches. Art Direction is phenomenal with it switching up its direction multiple times and all of it feeling really well designed and it being both distinct and connected at the same time. 

Sound and Audio are brilliant as well with the soundtrack always having this sense of eeriness and the audio being a perfect match for this environment. 

In terms of gameplay, it is pure addiction. The whole game is pretty much a deck building roguelike and its crafted so so well. I love all the mechanics that the game gives you when it comes to types of cards to even playing them on the deck which was done in a really smart way. There's also escape room element to the game which (while there not be that much of it) I really like what they've done with it and definitely added another layer to the game.

Rating: 10/10

Summery: inscryption is a card game that takes place within its own world. With Luke being you in the story, you find yourself at a table apposing a strange figure on the other side. He lays out cards, a scale, and a bell. From there your journey with this masterpiece of a card game begins. One which is best enjoyed blindly.

Personal Notes: I have played through the game twice now, and both times were a blast. No game is like it, and it ranks on that special place in library among games such as Superliminal and Firewatch. It truly is a fantastic game, with a one of a kind unique visual take on card games. As well as a deep lore if you are into such. Plenty of Easter eggs to hunt for that are harder than most. There are sub reddits and plenty of YouTube channels to fall down the rabbit hole too. If you have any interest in cards, its super easy and does not take a high understanding of any other card games to enjoy. If card games are not really your thing do not let it discourage you from trying it. 

As a side note, doing voices for the characters makes it 10x better. Good luck challengers!",1705812441,1705812441,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

And I'm not just talking about the unique and strange game play, I'm also talking about the art style and graphics of the game as well. How in Act 1 it's 3D but still pixelized, but in Act 2 it turns a classic top down 2D/Pixel style. And the decision to make characters have their own sounds when they talk adds a lot to the feel of the game. The game play itself is really fun and cool, I genuinely really liked how despite all 3 acts being card related, they switch things up entirely and you have to relearn how to do most things. And the way they executed *how* these card games and rules work is honestly amazing. Not to mention, combining a card game with the horror genre? and making it an ARG? I really hope to see more games *this* unique from these developers because it was a great experience. Oh, and the boss fights in act 3, some of the coolest mechanics I've ever seen in a game, one of them connects you to the internet and create your own card to send to another real player, and if they win with your card then you win, but you can also receive cards from others too; another boss makes you dig through your own computer files to find the biggest sized files you can and depending on how large it is, you do extra damage; and I could talk about the other two Uberbot bosses but I think I've made my point.

-Great soundtrack to listen to as you play, it really captures the mood of the game, especially the boss fights. (IThe ""Scrybe of Magick"" song is soooo good).
-The style and graphics of this game, as well as the character designs themselves is super charming to look at. (Despite the dude being a bit annoying, I really liked Po3. Also Lonely Wizbot best character 100/10 best boi).
-The game play itself has some of the coolest mechanics I've ever seen in a game, really shows how much thought and care the developers put into making this.

The story itself is a bit confusing. I get that it's suppose to be an ARG and you're suppose to figure it out and all - and that it's probably my fault for not understanding it completely - but I did get lost like halfway through, especially towards the end when somehow the game disc is sentient or something? There's nothing wrong with the story itself, maybe just the way it's presented. EDIT: I just found out this was an actual ARG where people had to find the Inscryption floppy disk irl, I just did a bunch of research on the puzzles and what people had to figure out to get the full story, I completely take what I said before this back because now i understand that it's suppose to be hard to understand on purpose. The developers really went all out with hiding secrets, they even hid stuff in past games that you have to play to decipher codes in this game.

All in all this is one of the cooler and more fun games I've played in years, can't really think of another that was - for the millionth time - this unique. I mean there's really no better words to describe this game besides unique. Thank you developers for this experience. 10/10.",1670208949,1705766364,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I bought this game on sale for about $12 and thought it looked pretty cool and fun. Little did I know that this game was way more than I thought it was. I was expecting a simple card game with some horror elements that I would play for a couple hours; what I received was an absolute masterpiece with deep story and insane plot twists. The card game its self is incredibly fun (at least in the first act) and everything from the art style to the direction is pure perfection.

Yet it's also a continuation of an ever deepening story of mystery, horror, and video gaming itself. Right when you boot up the main menu and press ""continue"" in lieu of starting a new game (the option being denied to you... at first), you are immediately introduced to the nature of Inscryption as a subversion of even your most basic expectations. A game where the questions you'd normally ask no longer apply, where the story can only be deciphered by actively searching for it, where your perspective as a player (and perhaps YouTuber) is directly integrated into the character you play as and the gameplay you experience. 

Few games have the balance between showing you the ropes and refusing to hold your hand, and fewer still successfully make that a rewarding experience throughout the entirety of its content. This is also the first time I've ever encountered a game where I was invested in the story, couldn't fully make it out, then realized that that was because I was meant to play other games from the same developer without ever being told or clued in directly by the game itself; subtle hints and references to Pony Island and The Hex are included in such a way that both longtime fans and discovering newcomers can be pleasantly satisfied.

1. Interesting concept, especially Act 1. Really enjoyed the game mechanic concept, best part of the whole game.

2. Act 2 was a little less interesting than Act 1, but still kept the charm of the card battle mechanic.

3. With the added free DLC, the game has a bit more longevity due to replaying the Act 1 game mode.

4. Character designs were interesting and some of the meta concepts were fun. Overall I enjoyed the theme it was going for. 

5. Acts 1-3 are all pretty easy to beat even with the rouge-like mechanics and RNG. 

6. Game is able to be modded 


Con's

1. RNG can be a bit too punishing at times with the DLC. (obviously its a rouge-like to an extent but there are limits) even if you are not using the totems to increase difficulty, there will be many times you will just outright lose a fight due to bad RNG and since you can't quite build your deck in the typical sense, this can be a bit frustrating when you lose multiple runs in a row and you are just wanting to progress with unlocking more cards. 

2. Some cards are particularly not as helpful as others and feel like a waste of space (the ant cards for example, takes a lot to setup and good RNG to have a low card deck to get them on the field sooner. 
 
3. Too meta for its own good sometimes or doesn't quite land, mostly does though.

4. Act 3 was the a bit tedious game play wise and I think if you were not forced to have the color scheme as a dim blue, I wouldn't have minded nearly as much, but the other Acts had color variety and your eyes will miss that and get tired.

5. No way that I know of without mods to try and build a custom deck to use on more challenging runs.

Overall: A creative and fun game with a few flaws (some a bit more noticeable than others), but some of these ""flaws"" may be due to design choice and just are not for everyone, which is fine. Definitely worth playing all the way through. Looking forward to what the developer does next.",1677734306,1705698732,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Sadly, ""Inscryption"" is the worst possible kind of RNG card game you can find.

You can nurture your awesome card deck and creatures for 3 maps only to got the worst possible kind of hand you can be dealt with on a boss. 

And you won't even have a chance to play your awesome cards cause you'll be destroyed in three turns without any chances to pull something good out of the deck.

And the boss has two lives (with some ugly special when he loses one) and player suddenly got only one life (even though you really tried to conserve two lives for the whole run).

And this happens like three runs in a row.

This is not ""integration of story and gameplay,"" this is sloppy game design.


The entire game is so confused that it cannot decide whether you have a skill or a luck issue. I do not want to die over and over and over and wait until I get a decent setup, I want to get good and learn from my mistakes if I lose. Getting curb-stomped because you're helpless to stop something that is not even in your control is NOT fun. Having the majority of your progress undone because you drew a useless hand while your opponent draws a god hand happen to you on a regular basis is frustrating.


The third act takes the cake for bad game design: Take that majority luck based gameplay, take that dying 100's of times until you get lucky, and you get act 3. You will die SO MANY TIMES without being able to do anything about it, and you will not even be able to remove shitty cards from your deck. There is no strategy, there is only blind luck. I sequence broke and got the 20/20 ouroborobot early, and I could NEVER draw it because my deck was filled with so much useless junk. I ended up uninstalling it after deciding it was one of the least enjoyable games I have played.

Spoiler in case you're still interested in how this garbage game ends: [spoiler] Remember how I said that the game turned into a shitty ARG? Well, if you didn't care for that part of the game and glossed right over it, you'll get an ending where your character gets smoked, and that corporate girl steals the game. It comes out of nowhere and you have no idea what is even happening unless you've played this developer's previous games before. It's so incredibly disappointing that you don't even know why this girl would choose to murder the MC in such an over the top fashion unless you've caught up with the entire story. [/spoiler]
The ending ends up being ""What just happened? Why should I care?"" and seemingly there for shock value alone.

Please spend your money on a deck building game that actually considers how much fun the player will have. You will get more enjoyment by literally bashing your skull against a brick-wall rather than figuratively in this case.",1705193294,1705193294,False,1,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

(Minor spoiler alert)

The game is divided into three different acts. Most of the negative review come from the second act being boring and annoying. While this is true to an extant, you get over it quickly. Act three is more of a challenge and is interesting enough, altho it isn't made for everyone. Both are more story driven than act 1 and can therefore feel a bit more boring to someone who came solely for the roguelike aspect of the game.

To those who only want to play the first act over and over without having to complete the other 2 acts, you can just press ""Shift + M + K"" in the menu. This will allow you to unlock a run based gamemode solely happening in act 1. I would still suggest finishing the game before doing so.

Firstly, the card game is alright. It evolves enough to keep it mostly interesting and I did enjoy it most of the time, but some parts of the game felt like a bit of a grind. As the card game is most of the gameplay loop, you'd think this would be a problem, but not really as that's the only negative thing I have to say about the game, as despite the gameplay feeling like a grind occasionally, I kept playing because the atmosphere and story were impeccable and I desperately wanted to know more.

It is unlike almost any other game I have played, not just because it's a roguelike card builder, a genre I'm not particularly into, but also what it is beneath all that. I recommend you don't read this review and just purchase the game for yourself, don't read anything about it just go in totally blind. Preserving that first time playthrough as one without any knowledge of the game is the best, so just pick up a copy and go to town. You might not think you love card games but I swear it's easy to understand and SUPER addictive. 

Okay. Don't read anymore. 





I've never thought to myself ""What is this game"" while playing something before. Don't get me wrong, similar things have been said while playing weirdo kinda stories like Death Stranding or Nier Automata, but when I say ""What is this game"" in relation to Inscryption, I genuinely did not understand what the game I was playing actually was within its own world. What you think Inscryption is, the card game in an abandoned cabin with a crazy man, is not actually the game. That's actually a recording of someone playing a game he found in the woods. You watch video clips of a real guy and watch as he descends into this mystery with you. When you find the ability to start a new game it then becomes a 2D, 8-bit NES style RPG. Then after that it returns to 3D but now you're stuck with a crazy robot in an abandoned factory. Inscryption refuses to be fully grasped, and I have never played anything quite like it. 
While I enjoyed Act 1's gameplay the most, the story it told throughout was undeniably so intriguing and fantastic. Alongside that, the real-world ARG and the inter-connectedness of this game with the creator's other works is staggering in it's planning and thoroughness. Finishing Inscyption the card game only ends the first act, and finishing Inscryption the video game is only the beginning of your own research into the crazy lore behind it all. 
This is, without a doubt, an indie masterpiece, a scarily well-constructed mystery, and just a badass card game. I genuinely cannot wait for whatever Daniel Mullins releases next",1704764604,1704764731,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

If you have had this game spoiled for you, get it and check out the rabbit hole of the insanity that is the ARG by playing it, then searching for the questions that the game presents.

If you already know the ARG, but somehow don't have the game, get the game if you can afford it anyways because it's fun  and if the content you've seen has been entertaining, it's worth supporting.

The first act of the game lives up to exactly what is promised in the promotional videos - a grim, dark, naturalistic card game mixed with escape room elements and mystery. This phase lasts 4-5 hours.

After this first act is over, without spoiling details, the rug gets pulled out from under you and the entire game changes for the worse. The atmosphere becomes stale, the mechanics less fun, the mystery is lost. The game goes from being a 10/10 to being a 4/10 just because the author is trying to be special and ""artsy"" by having this fourth wall breaking ""game within a game"" experience.

This game alone was the right kind of style I prefer and it saddens me most of the competition rather copy themselves instead of making a solid card game.

The two that followed fell short of the mark in my blunt opinion and they weren't as investing or immersive. However, I would recommend this game for chapter 1 alone, even going so far as to say that if they added an endless chapter 1 gamemode, it would be perfect. (Beating chapter one without the 'necessary equipment' kind of allows this).
Beat the game in 12.2 hours (Finished it all in one day which is kinda unhealthy, but hey good game + School 
 holidays).
As much as I hate on the second two chapters they weren't bad or even mediocre, they were still very enjoyable and challenging.
There's a bunch of lore and secrets that I feel I haven't even grazed yet and will certainly call for more playthroughs!
However, as much as I enjoy this and its style, no game will be everyone's cup of tea so take this with a grain of salt if you haven't played games like this.

1092790,155297016,76561198835654686,0,3,4973,0,4973,1704447408,"After finishing this game to the fullest, I'd have to say it was one of the best designed games I've ever played (mechanically). The game has a great tutorial, which introduces all the important mechanics seamlessly. It even provides a great challenge if you play the game again from the beginning and try to make it to the end on the first run!

The mechanics themselves are really nuanced and lead to very thoughtful gameplay, even with not that much to have to look at, I would still find myself thinking long and hard about every move I made to survive the difficult situation in front of me, or to capitalist on the non-difficult situation in front of me.

Despite requiring a lot of thinking sometimes (especially in [spoiler] Kaycee's Mod [/spoiler]) there is always plenty of room to make mistakes and goof around. And if you DO want to put in though in a relatively safe situation, the game always rewards you for it. You get more teeth the more damage you do past what you need, using less items can give you special cards, or you can even set up for paintings. The list goes on.

I also love how the style of the game fits so well with the mechanics. It really feels like a fight for your life where anything goes, especially with the items. It feels really despite to pull your teeth out and what not. And the way that Leshy takes the rules of the game so seriously and even gets annoyed when [spoiler] You get a third candle from the painting [/spoiler] or [spoiler] Kaycee nerfs fecundity [/spoiler].

As far as the story and secrets go, the game handles them both together and pretty well. The game will set up something mysterious that it will satisfyingly pay off later. There are TONS of smaller examples, but some of the biggest secrets lead to some of the best story moments. For example, the game sets up that there is something behind the door, and in most games it might just be atmosphere, but in this game, it's actually the most important thing in the room! I won't say much more other than that, but basically, whenever I saw something weird or was curious about something, there was almost ALWAYS something there (and not just in the story/room segments, in the card game too, like sigil interactions and whatnot.)

As far as the main story goes, it's great! There are a lot of great moments that you should probably go in blind for. And don't let looks deceive you there is a lot more to the game than what's on the Steam page. Though, the game doesn't get much harder after that point, just new mechanics. If your into the secret hunting and following the mysteries you find, there's lots in store for you! If you just care about the challenge of the card game and the story isn't for you, then there is more for you after you beet the game:

After [spoiler] getting the ""Dramatic Finale"" achievement [/spoiler] you unlock [spoiler] Kaycee's mod, where you can re-battle Leshy with different starting decks and challenges and most of the room mechanics are disabled and a lot of the op mechanics like campfires, fecundity, and moon cheesing are nerfed, this is where the challenge really picks up. [/spoiler]

It's for everyone to decide themselves when they are done with a game. If you were in it for the story, you'll be done after beating the game. But if you enjoy following secrets and want to figure out all the answers to those questions you were wondering, the game has only just begun. For me, getting all the achievements was satisfactory for me, but I could probably still challenge myself more in [spoiler] Kaycee's Mod [/spoiler] though it would just be arbitrary challenges for my own sake at that point which, in my opinion, ruins the whole anything goes feel of the game, and I don't feel like I'm accomplishing anything. But if you like to challenge yourself, there's hundreds of hours of fun waiting for you.

Overall, it's still just a game about playing cards, but you better believe it's the best game about playing cards I've ever played!",1704450793,1704450793,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

at this point though I'm scared to play back through the game due to the fact that it will be used against me and I will have zero counter.
One thing though - The totems are bullshit levels of scary and unpredictable, they could either be the end of you or not be threatening at all.

I spotted this game in my friend's collections and had noticed them playing it a bit. I had no idea what I was about to get myself into... I'll do my best to keep this as spoiler free as possible. 

The gameplay is fascinating and quick to learn, I finished the game and I'm on my second run through, and still finding all sorts of new things that I missed the first time! The game starts off simple in theory, and then begins to progress and pull you into this crazy story. The mechanics are wonderful, and at times I was forgetting I was playing the same game. 

This is a perfect game for anyone who loves mystery, deep cryptic lore, lowkey horror vibes, and looking for a unique game and story to begin playing. It combines strategy wonderfully with its lore. It's addictive, from the very start, I couldn't put it down. There were twists after turns after twists, and it catered to my inner love for cryptic mystery and Trading Card Games. The developers absolutely put so much love into this game. From the function balance, to even how some of the characters resemble types of TCG players you'd play against. 

The plot is concrete - it adds a sense of mystery. Questions are being answered (and being created) as I'm playing through my second play through. The second play through has been giving me time to really appreciate all the foreshadowing and setup that was placed into the plot from the very beginning. 

And functionally? Oh my God. There are Three Acts to this game -- each one just as interesting as the last. I was baffled when switching between them as the play style gets very interesting and very different very quickly. I was baffled and left stunned at the end of the game, and needed to take a moment to actually think about what had happened. And then, of course, I went right back into it with more questions that I HAD to get answered. 

Highly recommend for anyone looking for some fun meta-game type lore to add to their gaming repertoire.

Act 1: This part has amazing atmosphere. A psychopath holds you prisoner in his log cabin and forces you to play his homebrew card game. It is somewhat like MtG or Hearthstone, but with deck-building and rogue elements. Your captor pulls out a map to use as a gameboard, and basically does a table-top roleplay of your character travelling through several places. You choose which places to go to, which net you different opportunities to adjust the cards in your deck in different ways. You are playing to survive, both figuratively and literally. If you enjoyed the deck-building elements and dealer from Hand of Fate, you'll especially enjoy this.

Act 2: The game transforms into a card RPG with 2D graphics in the vein of Pokemon TCG on gameboy, or Sacred Cards on gba. You are dumped into a card-themed world, and have to duel everyone using some of what you've learned in Act 1, but with some new mechanics added in. This is the most controversial part of the game, since it excises the atmosphere of Act 1. I ended up liking this part quite a lot, even if it is a pretty big departure from the previous act. I don't blame anyone who had trouble with this part, since being good at reading the board is more important than ever. I didn't have too much trouble thankfully - experimentation is key here.

Act 3: The game switches back to the Act 1 format with a different character - you are held prisoner in a technology themed place by someone who forgoes the atmospheric treatment of Act 1. Pretty good mechanically, and the atmosphere isn't that bad even if it doesn't reach the heights of Act 1.

Kaycee's Mod: An add-on was created for the game which has the player run through Act 1 with some optional handicaps. I beta tested this, and I have to say it's pretty terrible. Basically a russian roulette simulator. At best, it's just Act 1 over and over with few new experiences.

Custom mods: There are an awful lot of them on thunderstore. I tried to use some of them, but the process is not user friendly. Too many scattered components are needed and not explained well.",1641412187,1704333392,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- It's not industry leading graphics
- it's not hours of tutorials

This game strikes a wonderful balance between simple enough to pick up easily but also complex enough to satisfy a more hardcore card game player. Mechanics of the card game portion are very clear and always at the players side if they need more info but never slowing the pace of the game for much more than a second if ever. The rest of the game I wont say much to spoil but they are perfectly mysterious without giving themselves away in any boring or obvious fashion. That part of the game felt satisfying enough without being a slog either.

I'm curious how much more I have to see, but even if there isn't much more I would recommend this game to anyone. 

I have never experienced being in an escape room, playing DnD with evil itself who plays out combat with a card game, where cheating is expected.

I didn't even know I wanted that. Please, by all means rob me of my money for some DLC, don't even tell me what I'm getting I don't want to know (ahead of time) and I know it'll be solid.

Allowing the mystery and thriller aspect of the game shroud the rules and mechanics enough to let the player navigate how to play through trial and error is exactly what so many games could learn from. s",1704183539,1704183539,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

in terms of expectations, this game will absolutely screw you over and get you tilted countless times especially in the first act and it will take a while for everything to click or for you to get lucky enough. despite all that, it stays fun and gripping throughout and there are no points in the game that arent worth playing through to the end (and i say that for good reason)

great art that you can tell was crafted carefully to build tension and set your expectations going forward.
spooky backwoods horror atmosphere really demands your attention from the word go.
deck building was unique and tied into a mysterious story that only gave you a few puzzle pieces to sink it's hooks into your intrigue.
2nd act:
Throws that all out the window for a 16bt poke'undertale'mon mess that looks nothing like the 1st act.
Intriguing plots devolve into a crazy narrative pile that goes nowhere and characters actions seem completely haphazard because we don't know much of anything about them or their motivations.  The deck building gets broken into individual parts and offers a unsatisfyingly basic play dynamic.
3rd act:
Tries to take a page from the 1st act and reestablish the setting but with a different theme.  You feel like things are back on track until you are set with a mobile game walk around and another new deck building mechanic.  Story went off the rails in the 2nd act and now it's just a smoldering heap that's just randomly lurching and hissing at you until it ends.  Leaving you with questions that you don't care enough to find the answers too.

overall: 4 outa' 10
not worth it. 
Feels almost like a bait and switch.
Kay'cee mod is the actual rogue-like aspect but only unlocks after beating the game and you don't keep anything you unlocked in the story play through.

Act 1 is really cool and got me hooked. the little bits of lore inbetween acts are also cool, but less interesting imo. Act 2 made it fall apart for me. Ive been playing for the last few hours since I got the game, and for about the last 2 Ive had to constantly refight enemies because act 2 takes all the good stuff in act 1 and replaces it with RNG. If you dont get good cards, oh well. the enemy will beat you in 2. Time to reset and hope you get a better card setup. There is a clover to help redo your first hand if you dont like it, but it hasnt really helped.

The RNG keeps you on your toes, and having to constantly think about ways to evolve your deck to match your current run keeps you hooked and playing for hours.  I would have never imagined a mashup like this, but it was done beautifully.  Odd in a game that is set in a macabre cabin with pixelated, horror-themed visuals!

There are three distinct acts in the game, each playing very different than the one before it.  It seems that when Inscryption is searched online, only visuals of Act 1 are shown.  The following two acts could easily be their own games in their own right.  New mechanics, new decks, new maps and styles of play, AND new cards are introduced as well.

AND JUST WHEN YOU THINK YOU'VE FINISHED, there's Kaycee's Mod.  Basically an expansion to the Act 1 base game, but in a tiered presentation instead.  You'll find yourself fighting through the same four maps from Act 1, but with the ability to add challenge skull modifiers while unlocking new starter decks to try with the completion of every other successful run (similar to the challenge skulls in Halo).

We just 100%'d the game at nearly 80 hours, and now, admittedly there isn't much left to do.  Replayability, could continue to be a thing if you wanted to test different things and strategies, but for now we'll wait and see if anything gets added to this game.  We'd be back in a heartbeat.

You won't get an Exodia The Forbidden One, but your cards can be shred to pieces.. More pieces than the ones you would have to gather before trying to summon the aforementioned creature. So keep in mind there‚Äôs no turning back or salvation for your poor little companions. Not even a referee will be able to say: since that invocation is banned in competitions you can keep the parts again! Let me tell you that here, this is not going to happen‚Ä¶ You will have to fight and strengthen your deck, yes, but for your own survival. So‚Ä¶ Like a famous card duelist once quoted: It 's time to du-du-duel!

Okay time to get serious here * BRAIN PLEASE NO MORE YU-GI-OH REFERENCES!*

The story is one plot twist after another, and let me tell you that never in my life have I enjoyed a card game so much. The mechanics are the most polished I ever found in a game of this kind, the originality of the matches, the story itself and even the design is, simply put, mind blowing. Even the non existent tutorial and the way they guide you to learn all the game mechanics that keep piling up one after another is brilliant.
Sometimes you will not know what to expect next and that will keep your survival instinct at the highest level possible, so you can just stare at everyone with suspicious eyes not knowing if you can even trust your own cards anymore.
The power of friendship will not help your deck to improve and keep getting deadlier, your choices will. So be careful cause sometimes the devil likes to wear prada and other times he likes to bust your deck out of existence.
Are you not photogenic? Don't worry! Your fear of cameras may even be useful to you‚Ä¶

My personal advice to survive this journey is: DON‚ÄôT TRUST ANYONE, NOT YOUR FRIENDS FROM STEAM, NOT YOUR OWN CARDS, AND NOT EVEN YOURSELF!

Personally, I believe Inscryption is one of those games that you have to experience firsthand, and give it a chance, but better do it without seeing anything previously.. So the events that are going to happen end up catching you by surprise.. There are some moments that even reached my heart. 
[spoiler]I cried, not gonna lie when you are almost at the end of the game and the opponents thoughts at the last moments of their life were only wanting to give you a handshake because they considered you a worthy rival‚Ä¶.[/spoiler]
I bought and completed this game on PS4 and then started to play it on steam, even though I‚Äôm not so fond of card-based games tbh.

The developer even released a free update which unlocks the infinite mode for the card du-du-duels!

The third act is by far the worst, being an eyesore slog through really boring fights. I wish Act 1 was the entire game with extended content/more opportunities to grow your deck/ more bosses.

Act 3 slowed to a halt though. It feels pretty impossible without specific breaking with ourobot and the gameplay loop just isn't fun.

I got to the second boss a few times, but died sadly. After a few deaths I got bored and annoyed, and just tried to do it fast as to not have to read dialogue or make too many choices. I didn't like how every time you died, you'd have to restart from the beginning of the map (at least in this first act from what I've read), and have to make your way through again. Most fights weren't too bad, but some were down right unfair, with you either losing or just using all cards.

It is a challenging game to review at any length without spoilers, but I won't put any in here. In truth, Inscryption is one of the best games ever made and is easily the number one in its genre. How the developers fused a deck-building game with psychological horror, two polar opposite genres, into one game is nothing short of something worth being universally lauded. The game starts in a cabin with a mysterious figure. You can't leave the cabin, and this figure, who acts as a sort of Dungeon Master, leads the game, and you play along. Most of the game is deck-building and playing with its unique rules. It's easy to learn, and you'll likely find it the most enjoyable part. The gameplay for the card-playing aspects is genuinely fun. Around the cabin, you've got little things to do; you can leave the table at more or less any time, and a few puzzles to solve that are worth doing and will aid you in your quest to beat the mysterious cabin figure. That being said, I'll mostly end my review here; the game only gets better the more you play it, and you'll be pleasantly surprised at what you find. The writing is phenomenal and philosophical, as well as downright sadistic. The Soundtrack is also an absolute banger. I'll recommend this game to anyone and everyone. It's genuinely some of the most fun I've had last year. 10/10. Daniel Mullins is fucking genius.

The game's biggest strength is it's atmosphere, which is incredibly unique and diverse. 

Personally, I think the acts are all quite good - they do play pretty differently though even if mechanics carry over. I think the different visual style of act 2 throws people off, but that act is very heavy on having a solid first turn, so I understand the mild frustration. If I'm being honest, I prefer Acts 1 and 3 overall, but Act 2 is still very enjoyable.

I played for 12 hours but it feels like I played for 1. If there's ever a sequel that plays like the card game in this I will buy it instantly. It's super easy to get the hang of and I may of abused reloading to get past some parts so I didn't have to backtrack as much if I didn't. But it was really fun trying to understand the hidden lore and I didn't even know that the other games from these creators link up with the lore somewhat.

I came to play a deck builder and I got something that wasn't really what I expected.  I don't get all of the interactive ""stuff"" that's in the cabin.  So I guess there's some escape room stuff, but who cares?  I managed to unlock a few things that one of the talking cards said to do and it unlocked another talking card ... and these cards had a dialog that I couldn't care less about.

The game sort of plays out like a Magic the Gathering style where you have to sacrifice cards to pay the costs of the real cards you want to play.  Some cards cost blood, others bones.  If there's other costs then I don't know because I gave up.

Comparing to a few other roguelike deck builders:

Slay the Spire is the GOAT and one of the first that really nails the game loop nicely.

Chrono Ark seems to have a much deeper story and more variety with different characters you can team up with.

Tainted Grail: Conquest has gameplay that is on-par with StS but is completely oozing with creepy atmosphere and storytelling and I've loved every minute playing that game.

Others I've enjoyed include Loop Hero, Stacklands, and the campy Neoverse.

Although the majority of the game is based around deck building and puzzle-solving, Inscryption does an amazing job at conveying a sense of horror and an unsettling atmosphere. Characters give subtle hints about the game's outcome and occasionally reveal bits of lore, letting you pick up the pieces as the game progresses.

If you‚Äôre a fan of deck building and card-game strategy games, you will absolutely love this game.  The developer has also included a special mode that allows endless replayability of the first section (though I've yet to try this part myself). If you are such a player, you can confidently skip the rest of this review and buy the game! However, if you aren't a fan of deck building games, you should keep reading.


Factors to Consider:

A. An Intriguing Plot

The plot of Inscryption is laced with mystery. Questions like ‚ÄúWhy does the game exist?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhy is there no information about it online?‚Äù, and ‚ÄúWhat secrets does the game hold?‚Äù might draw your attention as you play and experience the game and see the story from the protagonist‚Äôs eyes.

Here‚Äôs a quick summary of the plot‚Äôs beginning:

[spoiler]The story shows Luke Carder, a card-collecting YouTuber, who found a mysterious game out in the woods after receiving coordinates from an old Inscryption card pack. Luke is curious and begins to question the game's existence and contacts the company that made the cards, GameFuna, after finding no information online. This company states that no such game exists and threatens legal action if the property in question is not returned to them. Luke ignores their warning and continues his playthrough and investigation into the game's hidden secrets.[/spoiler]


B. Gameplay

As mentioned earlier, Inscryption's gameplay heavily leans on deck building and strategy. As an enthusiast of these types of games, I found Inscryption to be particularly satisfying. Defeating Leshy, the first main boss you meet, gives me a great sense of accomplishment. The rest of the game continues to provide this same feeling as you progress and beat each character.

The rest of the gameplay heavily involves environmental exploration and puzzle-solving, which I found equally enjoyable. As I was playing, I found myself deeply immersed in the story and the carefully thought-out environment. Unfortunately, these aspects of the game are not replayable. Once the main game and puzzles are finished and solved, there‚Äôs nothing left to discover, apart from a few secrets or missed interactions. It‚Äôs worth noting that the replayable mode might offer additional secrets, puzzles, and changes to gameplay, but I cannot comment on it in this review since I haven‚Äôt played it yet.

C. Difficulty & Learning

To start, it might be difficult to remember the effects of each card type or how to use the various elements present in the game, but I found that it was rather easily picked up over time. Even after taking a substantial break from the game, I was able to quickly relearn the mechanics just by playing.


Conclusion:

In conclusion, Inscription is a captivating experience that combines deck-building and puzzle-solving with a dark, mysterious plot. The game provides players with an immersive and unsettling atmosphere, driving you forward with appropriate challenges in each section. Though the game initially seems complex, most of the mechanics can be easily picked up and learned over time, even after significant breaks between play-sessions. Once the game is finished and all the puzzles are solved, there is little left to explore in the main game, but players may find new experiences contained in the included replayable mode. If you‚Äôre a fan of deck-building strategy games, or if you just enjoy a good mystery, Inscryption just might be the game for you.

The big problem I had, on release: Youtube algorithm showed me spoilers for all the major twists in the game in recommended videos thumbnails. On clickbait videos. But, to be fair, that is not the game's fault. However, I have something constructive to say as a result.

The game is very linear. Knowing what will happen from Youtube images, I deliberately was trying to create a different outcome in my game. And the game sometimes provides you with explicit choices. Fake choices. The game PRESENTS itself as a more open-ended one. Please don't do that, developers. I just felt worse shortly after getting spoiled.

In that time, I've played Inscryption through several times, written over a dozen fanfictions for it, drawn a ton of fanart, crafted a Leshy cosplay, and stayed active in the community for months. I've also watched numerous dissections of the plot and ARGs of all the main Mullinsverse games, and am actively looking forward to Pony Island 2.

Does this mean my opinion on Inscryption has changed?

Well, sort of.

The game does a massive disservice to itself by hiding everything after Act 1. I've seen so many posts of people getting incredibly frustrated with the unexpected direction Acts 2 and 3 take, and I personally make a point of spoiling the game whenever I recommend it. This is a game best enjoyed when you're not surprised by the drastic change in visual aesthetics, but the spoiler culture around Inscryption has left the fandom stunted and divided. I actually prefer Act 2 above all others for the more diverse card sets and mechanics, but also for the scant worldbuilding it provides.

This game is a slave to its meta elements, with the in-world storytelling left in tatters and the ARG in a domineering yet understated role. As an ARG, it's physically impossible to solve on one's own, which means that understanding the greater plot without scrounging around the internet or watching an hour-long video isn't doable. Inscryption's reliance on The Hex and possibly Pony Island 2 for plot details is also only to its detriment. Why should a fan of this game have to be a fan of the entire Mullinsverse just to comprehend the most basic of details? It seems Inscryption can't even get its own lore sorted, with the timeline of Kaycee's Mod seemingly contradicting the timeline of the main game. Luke learns Kaycee died a long time ago, and the format of Inscryption as a floppy disk game inspired by GameBoy Pokemon games makes the idea that Kaycee was programming this while Youtube existed a baffling paradox.

And yet despite the frustration and irritation I feel towards so many aspects of this game...I'm still playing it. I'm still in the fandom, writing and drawing and sewing and theorizing along with so many other people. There's something about the whole package that's irresistibly alluring, the mystique of its characters so tantalizing, that it's hard to quit this game. I want to know more about Magnificus and his students. I want to know more about Sado and Rebecha and GameWorks and how they all tie together. I want to see the plot untangled and dissected and laid out in a somewhat-sensical way. And I want to theorize and headcanon and create new ideas based on all the loose plot threads that I have no way of knowing whether Mullins will resolve in his next game or leave hanging forever.

It's that frustration and annoyance that leaves so many holes for a fandom to fill. The fans of this game can be so creative and the relatively small size of the community means there's little drama outside of people arguing about whether P03 or Magnificus are more morally corrupt (both camps are wrong; Grimora is actually the worst and no I will not budge on that opinion). I hate Inscryption and I don't recommend it for anything outside of its fun but bitterly easy gameplay. But I want everyone to play it and get mad and use that rage to create beautiful things out of it. Get sucked into it. Join me in this hell of our own making. You'll love it here.

Original review:
Unbelievably dull with a story that thinks it's much more interesting than it really is. I sloughed through the first few hours because my friends said act 2 was better but I really don't think the annoyance is worth it. You might like it if you're really into card games, but for me it was an exercise in frustration.

Edit: Just finished the game and god it only gets worse. Act 3 was enjoyable as a game, but the meta elements were weak and impossible to get into without getting obsessively into them. Obnoxious, pretentious, and full of itself.",1638592188,1702853216,True,0,0,0.411941856145858765,0,True,False,False

Positive:
For some context, I come from MTG, and am the type of person to not care in the slightest about lore. I like optimizing.
With that said, the spooky aesthetic act 1 was perfect. The glowing white eyes peering at you constantly, the dark atmosphere, the sounds, everything about that vibe was great. The gameplay is really fun and interesting, the resource system reminds me almost of treasure tokens from MTG. I quite liked it. I see many negative reviews from people saying it's too challenging with less than 5 hours playtime, and I don't want to be that guy, but you gotta get good at it. Theres things to learn, challenging puzzles, and so so so many decisions. I'm the type of person who buys games for that kind of stuff, I get that that's not everyone's cup of tea though. This may not be for you if it's not. I am a big fan of act 2's aesthetic, and the gameplay there is great too. I love the deckbuilding system, and the fact you can control every card in your deck and make tiny adjustments rather than in act 1 where you are at the mercy of the random events and the cards you find or get rid of is great imo. And I haven't even mentioned Kaycee's mod yet, it feels like learning how to play the game again every time I choose a new starter deck or strategy which I love. Still haven't managed to do skullstorm, but the fact that after a few days of nonstop trying to figure this game out there's still things I can't do is what keeps me playing.

Now for the negative:
As for act 1, where the jumpscares at? After I realized there was nothing startling and I could take my time even when told not to, I didn't really feel on edge anymore which took away some of the experience for me. The first hour or two every time I would get up or open something I would be bracing for something to pop out at me, but after a while I was just going about my business. I'm not sure if I love or hate the pain in the ass that is trying to keep your deck size and quality down, it's quite tedious. As for the bosses, the first couple are much harder than the final one IMO. I'm not sure that's a bad thing though? You finally after hours of work beat the first two, it feels good to breeze through the final boss, but still feels wrong to me. Act 2, only thing I didn't love was the lack of explanation for the energy and magic mechanics. They just plop you into this world with multiple intertwined new mechanics and no clear explanation of how to use them. I still don't fully get circuits or magic, I never really had a reason to put in the effort to teach myself. Now for the big part, act 3 was ugly. I hated the look. It goes from old cabin in the woods to retro game to like, mid 2000s depiction of a hologram table? The gameplay was alright but significantly worse than acts 1 and 2, although I will admit the bosses were great. Po3 being annoying the whole time was also, well, annoying.

Overall 9/10, really good game if you have the right expectation of what it is. It is not just in the cabin. I love it, some don't.",1702811126,1702813900,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Edit 03/21/22 : Kaycee's mod adds a interesting varient to the first phase of the game that creates an endless ascension mode. The adventure and lore building in this mode is quite weak, the new cards cause more problems than they offer solutions, and while the starter decks are fun, the ultimate reward is extremely underwhelming.

Less ""CCG"" like M:tG, where your goal is to acquire boosters to get great cards, and more like dominion or codex, where you have chances along the way to choose 1 of three every so often, and custom build a deck, one card at a time.

You are fighting with cards that have strength and health; health damage carries over from turn to turn, so cards wear out and must be replaced.

Most cards have a sacrifice cost; you spend cards placed on the board to bring out new cards. You can draw either a ""free"" 0-1 squirrel, or one of the good cards from your deck that require killing something. After your first death, you start to get cards with a cost of ""bones"" -- and every time something dies, you get at least one of those for free. So, instead of putting cards into resources, or land, you use them up, constantly cycling them.

Things you can kill: Squirrels, or cards that have used up almost all of their health from previous turns.

The game board -- there are 4 lanes, and most cards cannot change lanes, and only attack straight forward. Your opponent plays their cards one turn ahead of time -- so you see where it will be in time to do something about it. There is no ""summoning sickness"" -- all cards attack the turn they are placed, and defenders do not deal damage in response. So board tempo is critical, and can switch instantly.

Definitely get the demo to see how the card combat works. It only reveals the first boss, and there are at least three that I have seen so far, plus at least one more that I have not.

There is a lot to this card battle part of the game, and this is apparently only act 1 of three.
There is an option, after winning, to enable a ""long-term card battle"" mode, where the card battle part of the game keeps going. This is the main portion of the game.

The eeriness of the cabin, as well as who you're opposing, creates such an interesting mood. The card game itself is addicting. Although it may seem unfair when you die to a boss and have to restart, upgrading cards, discovering new ones, solving puzzles, and slowly building that extremely overpowered card make the journey feel exciting rather than sluggish. Discovering a strat to use on a boss you previously thought was just straight-up unfair is so satisfying and would give me the same rush Souls games would. The mystery behind what the hell is even happening is intriguing and keeps you wanting to play. 

...That is until you finish the relatively short first act. Which also happens to be the ONLY act you see on the store page, or anyone playing online. The second act has you play a 16-bit top-down RPG. There's still a card game, but the fundamentals have completely changed and it's just not as fun. The deck building is wonky and 80% of the cards are unplayable and will cause you to lose every encounter. The change in style made things somewhat hard to read (and just annoying) and I simply didn't care to be as involved with my deck as I did in the first act and had one randomized for me. The third act is not as bad, but it's mediocre and lost me entirely. It's a different card game from the first two, and it's just boring this time. There's no intrigue or mystery anymore. It almost feels like you're playing for nothing and the setting/mood isn't interesting. Arguably worse than the second act due to it being so unbelievably mediocre. 

I get contextually why the game changes with the story, and to be fair, it's a cool concept! It just doesn't work in this case. The story means nothing to me if the game isn't consistently fun and no amount of writing or gimmicks can make up for gameplay (IMO). I don't care how eccentric they are. It's disingenuous advertising because they want to keep a ""mystique"" to the game, but it really feels like it's just because they know the first act is the only one worth playing.",1702670866,1702670866,False,34,2,0.71768033504486084,0,True,False,False

Act 1 was easily the best part but the story was amazing as well and I loved every minute of it. The scary atmosphere and beautiful sound/ music design was the just tip of the iceberg. After figuring out the mechanics and really understanding what each card brings to the table the game just opens up to so many possibilities. The only things I would critique this game on are the puzzles not really being understandable sometimes if you don't look up tutorials and how awkward the fundamental gameplay changed going from part 1 forwards. Also the game ended too soon but I don't know if that's really a critique or me just wanting more. 9.4/10 amazingly addictive.

At its heart, that's exactly what Inscryption is, and it's a good one. Right when I finally developed a working strategy and started to get hooked, everything changed, and the game morphed right in front of my eyes, practically switching genres entirely on the fly.

Credit to the developer for creating something unlike anything else, and the card game itself is absolutely worth the price of the product by itself, but things got a little too meta for me by the end. I don't mind a twist or two here and there, but we veered so far off the original course that I wasn't even sure what I was playing anymore by the last half of the game.

Still, anyone who enjoys well-crafted card games should give this one a chance, and if you like surprises, all the better. I admire the developer for thinking so outside the box here, and I imagine there are all sorts of interesting ideas floating around in that mind of his.

One of the few times a game has both conveyed its feelings and story so unanimously I was hooked the  entire time. The visuals, music, and graphics support the horror feel as well as the feeling of danger that comes with playing the game. Mechanics are extremely unique and interesting and there is such a feeling of confusion that I miss when I first played Inscyption. I enjoyed the whole experience and the post game content is enthralling; Addicted to the infinite rogue-like post game content of course. 

Before going into spoiler territory, I would like to address the common feeling that people get once they finish Act 1. As the game is sliced into three main story acts, commonly, people are dissapointed by what Act 2 and 3 have to offer. I don't understand how someone will spend 4-6 hours playing through Act 1, gain so much trust in the game's ability to be competent, and immediately quit as soon as the status quo of the main game is challenged. Acts 2 and 3 fit into the narrative perfectly and the game play while different, still keeps its core mechanics and tone that the player is used to in Act 1. There is definitely a whiplash of style in Act 2, but it only adds to the story and does not detract from it. For those who quit after running around Act 2 for a little bit, this chapter is actually quite short and can be completed extremely fast if you know what you're doing. I would recommend revisiting the game especially since Act 3 kicks back into more of what the player is expecting. 

STORY AND GAME PLAY SPOILERS
[spoiler] The overall connection between the in game events as well as the ARG that has already been solved is extremely interesting especially with the meta analysis that Inscryption presents. Because you play as an actual player of the game, the 4th wall breaking moments in-game are extremely charming and pose a lot of questions. Moments such as P3 asking for your files on your computer, Leshy talking about the previous players that have died, and the game being discussed in meta by the scrybes. The story of the scrybes is extremely interesting and each have amazing character designs and personalities. One thing about the story is that I REALLY wish that there was more. There could be sooooo many interesting writing moments between Grimora and P3 for example. Continuing the cycle of each scribe taking over the game. Close to the final moments of the game, you get to play another card game with Grimora, and I wished to have another act where we play this chess game that she presents to us. I also feel that a lot of the card mechanics are under-utilised in Kaycee's mod. Specifically p3's and Magnificus' card selections. Both have interesting mechanics and I would love to see it in the infinite rogue-like format. These aren't particularly complaints, just something I really wish existed, possibly as a DLC. [/spoiler]

Probably a top 10 games moment.

Have been enjoying it, but there the RNG does definitely factor in to how each run is going to go and can cause you to be sent back to the beginning on an unlucky draw so be warned if that's something you don't want to deal with.  You basically collect cards, upgrade them where possible, and solve a few puzzles in the cabin. It's a simple concept but quite atmospheric and enjoyable if you like card based games. By far the best act of this game.

Act 2 is very different and changes into a pixel art style adventure x card battler. I enjoyed this part for the variety of deck builds and lore you can discover, but be aware the game does have some very sharp differences in game play throughout. 

Act 3... I'm still trying to get through it. The game feels like it's overstayed its welcome here as it's a bland, boring hybrid of the previous acts with bad graphics. You can't just push through it as similar to act one, a bad deck draw sends you back a few steps to try again, and again. Not enjoying it at all. 

Still rating as a positive as the first 2 acts are fun. It feels similar to other games by this dev where they're imaginative and have some great atmospheric parts, but other parts get too heavy on the punishing, overly repetitive parts that IMO could have been shortened to increase the overall game enjoyability at the expense of some play time. (I gave up on Pony Island as well which was far, far worse than this game for that aspect and watched a playthrough to see then ending.) Apparently there's a mod you can unlock to get another version of act 1 to play which is the only reason I'd finish it by this point.",1701837580,1702168165,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

All things that are explained in thetutorial are being explained by the narration of the ""game master"", the animations are taking ages and you end up hearing the very basics of any roguelite that you most likely already know if you played at least one roguelite/deckbuilder game. On your 3rd/4th run you're able to proceed to act 2 that is just boring and doesn't put up any challenge. In act 3 you're back to relatively the same format of a card game, except that here you don't get strangled when you lose, so you don't start anew but keep all the cards you've gotten so far, only lose your current ""robobucks"" that you can collect by reaching the chamber you've lost it in. Since your deck does not get reset to the starting one, you may end up with a joke of a deck that loses to the earliest fights in half of the cases. And you only have two options there: farm, get back to the waypoint, replenish your items and get back to the ""easiest"" encounters, then try to fix your awful deck with some stronger cards (sometimes making it even worse) or just going to the setting and erasing your save files. That's what I did, losing 12 hours of gameplay but slicing through the act 3 as if there was no contest. So I finished the game and got to ""Kaycee's mode"", which is a roguelite after the story is done. Except that it's considerably weaker than just act 1 and still explains nothing of how the game actually works.

Very punishing.

I thoroughly enjoyed it and it is now one of my absolute favourites. I can already tell that one day this game will give me nostalgia.
A short review kept as spoiler-free as possible:

PROS:
- atmospheric and immersive
- satisfying game mechanics
- great sound design
- skillfull balance of mystery, emotion, horror and comedy
- so far this game has been a bug-free experience for me and I have played over 36 hours as of now
- being able to play this entirely without a wifi connection has been a lifesaver for me
- my fears of not being able to properly play this due to having a low-end macbook that has been used by T-Rexes as far as its age is concerned, have not come true. Despite its size and complexity this game was wonderfully immersive for me even with low graphic settings and a bad computer setup. The lag I experienced was limited and I was able to enjoy this game to its fullest so far.
- for players who get bored quickly the main storyline of this game offers a lot of variety
- for players who do not like quick change and prefer and a consistent, repetitive experience, the part of the game called 'Kaycee's Mod' (which despite its name is an official part of the game and can be unlocked after completing the main storyline or by pressing a specific key combination in the menu if you're impatient) offers just that, a great challenge system and consistent gameplay

CONS:
- I am sure there are cons but currently I can't think of any, sorry. It's just a fantastic game if this is the kinda stuff you're into

NOTES TO CONSIDER:
- to players who are slow learners some parts of the main story may appear jarring at first. Take your time to fail as often as you need in order to learn, go at your own pace, it is not going to negatively effect your game. I can only give you the advice to keep playing through those experiences, they are intentionally made the way they are and end up enhancing the overall experience immensely. If you feel too stuck, the internet offers a lot of valuable tips for this game (although these often come with spoilers).
- DIALOGUE SPEED CAN BE ADJUSTED IN THE MENU!
- For those who have taken a liking to the first act and find the second and third threw them for a loop I advise you to keep playing anyway in order to get to something called 'Kaycee's Mod' (see points above in PROS)

I hope you consider this game and that it brings you as much joy as it has brought to me.",1702038121,1702038121,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Act 1 is amazing! I love the aesthetic, the choices, the gameplay, is perfect!
Act 2 is great, I love the 16 bit graphics, the autocard was great and made me actually think, it was fun! Hate the foils tho

Then Part 2 happens. And it's basically a different game. All the aesthetic elements and roguelike mechanics are gone, and there are additional card mechanics that are more complicated and less fun than what came before. All of this is to serve a meta-narrative that was intriguing at best and disruptive at worst. It feels like Game Theory bait.

Pros:
- Amazing atmosphere
- The storytelling is a lot of fun. Its funny, creepy and dramatic at the same time. Its like a modern fairy tale, which I think was the aim of the story.
- The game is well-balanced. If you have some experience with card-games you can easily get through. If you don't, the learning curve is not very steep.
- Lots of replayability. The free ""Kacey's Mod"" DLC is a excellent.
- That ending... wow.

Cons:
- Although the story and visual reveals at Act II and Act III will blow your mind, they are a lot weaker in terms of gameplay.
- Act III, in particular, can be a bit of a slog to get through. Trust me: its worth it for the ending. And the bosses in Act III are the best in the game, in my opinion.

I'm deleting my original review because there is no possible way to talk in detail about this game without getting into some pretty serious spoilers.

All I can say is that this game must have been a labor of love. It is entrancing from start to finish, a shockingly deep title masquerading as a simple card game with a spooky atmosphere. I cannot recommend it enough.

UPDATE EDIT: The dev is now actively working on an open beta FreeLC content to make a true roguelike experience as a bonus mode to the game. This is, without a doubt, the best possible addition that could have been made. I was bemoaning to a close friend how the game was cool, I just wished there was a bonus mode that set the story aside to just provide a difficult experience and NOW THERE IS!!!

The less you know the better, so if that description appeals to you, then get it.

If you are thinking of not getting it because that description is not up your alley, then let me give you some MILD SPOILERS to describe why this game isn't just good, its great.

[spoiler] The game is will constantly surprise you. No really. As soon as you think you have figured it out, it pulls the rug out from under you. I cannot adequately describe how meta the game is and how much the game changes as you as play. Not into card battlers? While it is big part of the game, the real draw is the story, mystery angle you find several hours in. The actual game mechanics are easy to master, its just a matter of thinking and learning as things are given to you, so even if this description is not normally the sort of you game you play, power through it because its not the real core of the game and it is actually pretty easy to get laughably good at this game.

The game is intentionally rigged against you from the start. You don't even get taught all the basic tutorial stuff at the beginning you have to lose multiple times to even unlock the rest of the tutorial and by that time you have had to watch the 'you lose' portion like three times at least. 
I hate developers that make failing an unavoidable mechanic of the game. It's like, ""haha you lost, now please put a label on your loss so that it can be flung in your face every time that you play after this time.""

Otherwise the gameplay is bland and dull the card battles are setup where you either win immediately or lose immediately and they are over so quickly that it's almost pointless to start one because as soon as you actually start getting into it it's already over. You get cards that require you to put down like 3 sacrifice cards to be able to play them and getting more than one sacrifice card down at a time is difficult and 2-3 of them is more or less impossible and if you are able to get that many down at one time then the cards you are going against are so weak that it's pointless to put that much effort in in the first place.

I personally found [spoiler]the first act to be the most troublesome and difficult out of the four[/spoiler]. I saw a lot of people absolutely cheese [spoiler] act 1[/spoiler] without even knowing how to play this genre of game, but I found no openings for an opportunity to hit that sweet spot until after SEVENTEEN HOURS of gameplay! It drove me crazy lmao. Everything else was ez pz after that, though. 

The ending was kind of abrupt, but I think that ""abrupt"" is a word that compliments this game perfectly. I want more, and I know that I lot of other players do, too! I'm glad that we've been left with so many mysteries unsolved and so many questions unanswered because - fingers crossed - the developer of this game might consider creating an Inscryption 2 (?)

I myself am a huge fan of deck builder games, this however is a whole other level!
In the beginning you are obviously confused of why you're not able to start a new game. Thus the mystery commences! Continuously intruding your thoughts on what is going on.
I really like the way foreshadowing is used in the little snippets with The Lucky Carder and the way everything unfolds later on just feels right.
But even if you don't focus on the story, this game is still lovely. I could spend hours playing without adressing the story and when I read the files of Kaycee in the mod expansion, I could relate so much to what was being expressed.
Especially the way I was able to upgrade my cards was of interest to me, unfolding almost an unlimited amount of possible combinations to make your deck perfect. Sometimes I would just try to achieve a single card combination to test it out on the battlefield.

TL;DR:
Great deck builder game you can play if you...
1. want to dive head first into a mystery
2. want something you can play with ease while watching or listening to something
3. like games with multiple layers
4. like deck building or card collecting games

Act 1: Want a Deathcard that is a Free 7/7 that flies, grows stronger after 1 turn, and makes chimes that if destroyed, this card will swing to that lane? go ahead.
Act 2: Discover an infinite? You're rich, sonny!
Act 3: Remember making that Deathcard? Let's let you make AND have MULTIPLE of these cards by trading in any card you want! also your fooling around in Act 2 gets you an appearance of the Bone Lord and a Mycologist Boss Battle!
Kaycee's Mod: What comes to someone's mind when presented with a custom challenge mode? if you said ""crank everything to the hardest setting,"" you're right on the money. even besides that, this post game is a full-on upgrade to Act 1 to further it as a Rougelike game, adding plenty of things that were not in Act 1, where the story is taking the back seat. sure, there's no deathcards and you have to unlock the extra cards, most of the challenges, and most Starter Decks, but it helps fuel a sense of progress.
missed a Main Story Achievement? simply go back to any of five points of the story (Start of Act 1, End of Act 1, Start of Act 2, Start of Act 3, and right before the Great Transendance)
Want to use mods? just like any great game, there's plenty of mods to suit your liking, Wanna play with Plants Vs Zombies characters, go ahead, Act 1 if Grimora was in control? Already ahead of you.

The development is better than what Steven King could think up, and the world is detailed in the right ways without being too cumbersome.
The best part IMO is that parts of the gameplay dynamic are broken in YOUR FAVOR. You can create combinations that are wildly to your advantage, but ultimately don't change the game negatively. You still experience the same robust story, you just get to do it in an overpowered way... Sometimes. And sometimes your overpowered glitched cards don't help at all! It's so much fun.

This game has several chapters. The vast majority of the videos we see here and there show the chapter 1, even all screenshots on this page are from chapter 1.

Now... I don't like card games, and I don't like 8-bits games.
BUT, what I saw in trailer was quite interesting, so I gave it a try.

And I really enjoyed chapter one.
But then... chapter 2... and it is not the same game at all. I don't play 8-bits usually because I can't see or read what's displayed in those quite easily. Chapter two takes away the nice graphics, switching you from first person to 2D crawler style, cards are ugly and almost un-readable to me... not the same game AT ALL.

At first, I wanted to give a positive review nonetheless, but, it feels to me that it is false advertising, plain and simple. It is a good game if you like the genre(s)... But seing how rare, everywhere, the images of chapters 2 and 3 are... I can't shake the feeling there is foul play here.

I'm really picky when it comes to card games, I love card games but I am easily turned off by a lot of factors.
Inscryption was quite the gamble for me, it will either be a hit or miss, no in-between.
And man, oh man, what I have to say is that this is MORE than a ""Hit"" could ever be.

Coming into this game, not knowing fully well what this game truly is, even thinking it'd be heavily leaning on the horror, while it certainly is, this game is SO SO SO SO SO much more than that, like actually legitimately.
This game goes beyond one's expectations, it tricks you, it lures you in, it's just so god damn captivating.
It isn't even a game anymore at this point, it's closer to a full-on film, but before that, one could even say it is an all-out experience.

The game is absolutely AMAZING, this is a big statement to say but I personally think this is THE best card game you'll ever find out there.

It isn't too flashy, bomboarded with graphics and designs, it's simple, yet beautiful, it immerses you into it with your own cards and characters, all-the-while never feeling bland, dull, or boring. The story, god, don't even get me started on it, if you love games like Undertale, DDLC, IMSCARED or such alike, please, I beg of you, PLEASE do play this game.
I cannot express enough just how many times this game had surprised me, shocked me, just, outright made me enjoy it over and over and over and over again, like one after another it hits you with something absolutely amazing, something absolutely wild, this game never gets old, no matter how long you play it, you just feel like you want to play more and more and more.

What I so love about this game is that how the actual game itself genuinely DOES have a story, and you always feel like you actually ARE going somewhere, you feel like there actually is a direction to everything you do even with the fact you aren't sure of it, or if you aren't aware, or even if you are flat out lost.

Even if you fail or be unable to beat something, it's instantly rewarded with something amazing right after, that always encapsulates you more and more into the game, the replayability of this game is truly endless.

I can't think of a game that would fit the criteria for both card game lovers and non-card game lovers, a game that would fit for both horror game lovers and even non-horror game lovers, hell, or even a game for people who want a story to the game, or just flat-out arcadey-esque fun.

This game has everything, absolutely everything, and I love each and every single second that I have spent my time on this game.

I plan on continuing this game sometime soon and perfecting honestly, it deserves every single penny in full price, and honestly, without a shadow of doubt, even more.

[b]Inscryption[/b] is a collectible card game with unique mechanics mixed in with some horror elements.

[h1]Pros & Cons[/h1]
[b]Pros:[/b]
+ Unique creepy visual style
+ Great gameplay variety
+ Fun hardcode mode

[b]Cons:[/b]
- Can feel unfair at times
- Mystries are unraveled way too soon

[h1]Story[/h1]
In the dense forest devoid of any light and roamed by scary beasts, there's a wooden cabin, where you're being held prisoner. Your captor generously offers you a game of cards; the rules are simple, and the stakes are your life. 

With this simple premise, the game manages to tell a pretty interesting story. Between the rounds of playing cards, you can get up from the table and look around the cabin. Discovering all of its mysteries and figuring out a way home takes a keen eye and a sharp mind. However, after around one-third of the game most of the mysteries are unraveled and the story becomes more straightforward and less obscure. It's hard to talk about it without venturing into spoiler territory. So, I guess I'll leave it at that to not spoil your experience.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Most reviewers say that you're supposed to go into this game blind, but I respectfully disagree with this viewpoint. I won't go into detail here, just in case you might consider this a spolier. Nonetheless, it's worth noting that for the most part of the game (around 90 percent I'd say), it uses collectible card game mechanics. Which means that you have to manage a deck of cards with various abilities and make use of their combinations in order to win. So, you should be aware of it before buying the game.

If you like this type of gameplay, then you'd probably love this game. It introduces a multitude of unique mechanics, I haven't seen in other similar games. Furthermore, [b]Inscryption[/b] also mixes up its formula so often, that you always have to learn new mechanics and synergies. Since the game isn't a multiplayer one, it doesn't have to deal with the balance issues so much. Because of that you can create some heavily overpowered decks, that will mow down every opponent in just a couple of turns. After completing the game you will also unlock a hardcore mode, that focuses on the battle mechanics and really puts your deck-building skills to the test.

[h1]Graphics & Audio[/h1]
Technically the game's visuals are nothing impressive, but the low-poly style can invoke nostalgia for PS1-era games. The lighting makes a great job at hiding technical imperfections of low-poly 3D models and highlighting the most important parts, that will let your imagination fill in the blanks. The soundtrack creates a tense atmosphere, that lets you feel the high stakes of each battle. Sound effects are also top notch, interacting with the game's world gives off this strange tactile pleasure. 

[h1]Performance[/h1]
Specs: AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Laptop GPU 8GB, 32GB RAM.

The game runs at 165 FPS in 1080p at max graphical settings. There were no crashes or other technical issues with the game.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
[b]Inscryption[/b] is an interesting take on a collectible card game genre, that can surprise even the ones who played a lot of the recent similar games. The story is also engaging even though it shows its hand way too soon. If you're a fan of card-based games or a fan of horror mysteries, I highly recommend this game.",1701078910,1701078910,True,47,1,0.749583005905151367,0,True,False,False

And the card game was SUPER addicting. I haven't seen any unique card game like this in a while so I'd like to believe that the developer created this originally and organically. Maybe it was inspired by other older card games? But I'm not sure which one if that was the case. At least it felt organic for sure though that I can most definitely say.

Inscryption is actually a deck building horror game, and it's absolutely incredible. This is not a game you want to be spoiled for.

We play as Luke Carder (Kevin Saxby), an enthusiastic card gamer and content creator. Luke comes into possession of a mysterious unrecognizable game called Inscryption. Luke plays the game and there is clearly something evil about it. In the game itself there are three separate card games with their own unique mechanics and boss fights, each sharing the same characters as each utmost notably the four Scrybes, who are sort of the Gods of this universe.

Inscryption is a mind blowing experience to be honest. The story is crafted with such love and it's genuinely really interesting every single moment you are playing. The mechanics are surprisingly well put together despite the primary focus being it's captivating mystery. The horror elements are also unexpected considering it's a deck building game, but they are effective and the art and visuals, and the overall eeriness of the situations you find yourself in make it a great horror experience too.

The characters were very memorable and I especially liked the talking cards who would react to your decisions. The premise is strong and would inspire others like it in the future, such as the Netflix film ""Choose or Die"" (2022). I would have been satisfied with just the first act of the game, but it goes the extra mile and creates full on entirely different games to play afterwards. My only criticisms are how busted and game breaking Ouroboros is (Although this was definitely intended, but I still don't like it), and the cringey acting from Kevin Saxby which kind of killed the tension and atmosphere the game was establishing.

Inscryption is a must play even if you don't personally fancy deck building card games. There is a myriad of secrets to be found here and the lore is clearly very in-depth and intriguing.

On the surface it just looks like your typical card strategy game , on the surface this is true ; however , there is this whole sinister plot and subplot hidden alongside that which gets revealed as you play and progress , even some things you may miss if you aren't very thorough or following a guide. So 10 / 10 would recommend though i will say certain sections can be highly challenging and will rely on luck whether it be your dray or your current AI opponents and their move. To mix things up the way the game is played changes as you enter later Arc's due to each unique character who's cards and style's are different than Leshy's who we are first introduced to. I'm curious as to what kind of decks others had and stuck with by the end-game , me my deck was a mix but primarily beast cards like the start of the game aside from the parts where you really need to use the other card types or have only those types. But there is no one ' Meta ' and good cards and combinations from each card type so there are many different ways to play. However , you may find yourself choosing some cards over others just due to your current need despite wanting others due to particularly difficult bosses you may be facing at the time. The best way to put it is there are highly situational factors as with any strategy game.

adding this part at the end with spoiler tags for anyone that doesn't already know and wants it to be a surprise. [spoiler]There is even one specific boss where you get to make and give a card to another player and bless them with something highly useful like i did or curse them with something useless. Also this same boss is a multiple parter , if no one is playing you fight the AI but if someone is playing at the same time as you , you end up having to face them and the winner gets to progress. To end things off , the game is designed to only be played once , and who you get matched with is completely random. But if you and a friend were to play that part at the same time there is a slim chance you may get matched with one another.[/spoiler]",1700956388,1700956388,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It has a deeply engaging story that becomes even more fascinating as things unravel, and its hand-carved atmosphere blends well with the characters, the cards and the narrative. This is a rabbit-hole kind of game and certainly one of the freshest and most impactful horror games I've played in a long time. It's ingenuity unleashed; a rare sort of experience that's daring and layered with a quality type of darkness you won't soon forget.

Gameplay-wise, it's challenging but not too unforgiving. It borrows (and subverts) a few mechanics from games like MTG but Inscryption is very much its own thing. And just like Slay The Spire (and another card video game I'd like to mention but can't because of spoilers), the D&D-like progression is both balanced and engaging. The various visuals and fitting soundtrack mixed with a solid gameplay loop make for a satisfying and tense experience.

I'd like to say more but I'd be getting into spoiler territory. This is a great game with a lot of thought and imagination behind it. It's equal parts fun, harrowing and engrossing.

9/10, maybe 9.5/10
Try not to spoil yourself if you can before going in. 

If you are interested in what's shown on the store page, just know that there's a lot more to the game than just that. It builds on itself a lot so things will change but also be pretty familiar. You may not vibe with a section here or there but it's worth it to keep playing. The game isn't too long and is divided up into three main acts. Lots of people are not big fans of act 2, and I wasn't at first. Once I got the hang of it though I warmed up to it. The game does its best to nudge you in the right direction to proceed, but you can get stuck in a couple spots not knowing what to do. If you're not sure what to do, stand up and walk around, there might be something you can do now, or you didn't realize you could do something with it until now.

Especially once you touch the Kaycee's Mod side of things (that skull storm achievement was hell and I think I hate bears now lol). But it's equally rewarding, and suuuuper fun to make really busted card combinations.

Inscyption is very much a ""if at first you don't succeed: die, die again"" kind of game. Every failed run is a learning experience and it - as well as exploration - will ensure you're a bit better prepared and equipped for your next run. So don't be discouraged if you fail a few runs; it's all part of the progression. :] In saying that, I would suggest holding off on touching Kaycee's Mod until you've completed the main story; both for lore reasons, and so you have a better, broader, understanding of how your cards, sigils, items, and totems work. It'll make things a bit easier and a smidge less aggravating. Because you will die a *lot* more in that than in the main game, thanks to the challenge modifiers.

I've been playing mtg for 20ish years so i tend to like deck building games in general (i.e. slay the spire, hearthstone, etc) but this game is awesome imo. the game has three distinct 'acts', the game evolves drastically after 20+ hours of gameplay, and does that again after about another 10-20 hours, into a third act where the game has reached its most sophisticated state, where you'll find about another 10-20 hours worth.

***there is a mandatory escape-room side-quest/over-world thing that must be completed before you can progress out of act 1: this was not my favorite component to the game but it does have a contribution to the game on the whole.

in this game the core mechanics that you learn in the first act are built on gradually throughout each act and then slightly morphed in the next act, but the skills, card knowledge, and strategies you have been learning are relevant throughout every act.

So my TL;DR is this: buy this game if you're interested in it but be prepared for some meh parts. It's mostly a very unique and fun experience that you'll walk away from wanting a sequel. You'll also get a ton of hours of gameplay out of it and it's free 'DLC'.

and now, here's my nitpicky ""I sunk too many hours into this game and this is what I think"".

Inscryption presents itself as a VERY engaging game with a promise of mystery and secrets. The cardplay is solid, it's a great introduction to deckbuilding games even if you don't particularly like the genre. The atmosphere is immersive*, the artstyle is super unique and nice to look at, and it's one of those games leaving you wanting for more.

... and then that all kinda starts falling apart as it goes on. Inscryption has a LOT of big ideas that, in my opinion, never got the space to become fully realized. They crammed a *ton* into it, and while usually I'd applaud that at times it felt like the story was getting in the way of gameplay. This game really loves to juxtapose fantasy with reality and while I understand it was a purposeful choice I found myself unable to suspend my disbelief for both concepts. 

I REALLY wish they would have stuck with something simpler because the quality of the game and the atmosphere is through the roof fantastic. The story of it all really just was not my cup of tea. I felt a very 'been there done that' kind of emotion for a game so outwardly unique as Inscryption is.

I digress, it feels seriously criminal to not recommend this game with how much I've enjoyed it. Everything about the gameplay down to the little sounds each object makes is immensely satisfying. They didn't miss a single time with the soundtrack either, every song is perfect for when it's played. It's definitely one of those hidden gems that just feels super nice to interact with because the dev took their time with things. [spoiler] And despite what people say about Act 1 being the best, I found myself really enjoying Act 3 and wishing that that too got it's own 'Kacyee's mod treatment'. [/spoiler]. Overall, I'm excited to see what this dev goes on to create.

So with all of that said, I would buy this game again at full price. You know when you spend twenty bucks on a game and come out with 90 hours in it that you've made a good purchase. You just... gotta be prepared to give it some grace in certain moments. You'll know them when you see them.",1700671712,1700671712,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is a very sub-par deckbuilder. You have essentially the same starting deck each time. Nothing like Slay the Spire's 4 characters, or Monster Train's 5 clans. Boss battles have the annoying tendency to introduce unique mechanics you've never seen before, almost guaranteeing you fail the first time. You fight the same three bosses every time, there's no variety. The actual game mechanics are very simplistic. Basically all you can do is summon creatures. There's no buffing, debuffing, instant effects, on-going effects, or anything else. Summon a creature to one of four lanes and then watch it auto-battle each turn until something dies.

The way the game does balance & difficulty just feels unsatisfying. You have to beat the boss twice, usually with some kind of board reset/wipe in between. I know giving the boss more health than you have is almost universal but I hate the ""you've killed the boss but they just revive with full hit points"" approach to it. It also suffers from the same problem other narrative-heavy roguelikes (like Sunless Sea) have. Nobody is interested in your dialogue after they've read 5 or 10 or 20 times. Why do I have to click 3 or 4 times to get out of the campfire or the trapper or whatever else?

But also, yeah, the second act is even worse. It adds more cards and styles of play to the deckbuilding (finally!) but changes almost everything else about the game, including the rogue-like aspect. So you don't even ""progress"" when you lose a battle and die. You just try, try, try again hoping for a better RNG. Also, a weird drop to 8-bit pixel graphics.

The game got so caught up being a 3rd year student's art project that it under-delivers on the actual game mechanics.",1700460755,1700614441,False,1,1,0.436507940292358398,0,True,False,False

Unfortunately, the second act is merely ok, and the third act is a tiresome mix of overly complex mechanics and a plot that you feel less and less connected with, before a finale that (by this time) feels like it's just gotten carried away with itself and is being overly mysterious for the sake of it, a bit like a thespian friend who gets carried away and should have stopped with the first act, rather than getting deeper and deeper into something that feels less and less satisfying.

If you don't want any spoilers (or, for some reason, the idea of reading a small essay where someone vents about Inscryption is unappealing to you) then you can go ahead and play the game. Just do it. There's a good forty hours of fun packed into this brilliant, masterful...
deeply unfinished game.
Okay spoilers ahead.
It. Is. Not. Finished. The story has no end. The plot is never resolved. All of your favorite characters die and you can do nothing but watch. You will never learn what the OLD_DATA is. The only person who gets to do that is Luke, the awful, annoying dude who does nothing at all for the story but is the only one who gets to see how it ends. Acts I, II and III are the setup for an absolutely killer Act IV, but there is none. There is only Kaycee's mod, a mildly fun twist on the game you were already playing, which allows you to unlock development logs, which DON'T resolve the story you were invested in but DO gradually reveal a confusing, unrelated B-plot about the old data being codes to blow up Berlin? What? That can't be it. Why on Earth would any of the Scrybes care if some city in a world they don't live in blows up? Furthermore, why would Luke go insane and try to smash the game with a hammer from being told that?  Does he have any reason to think it's real? And what does ANY of this have to do with the world of Inscryption, the world I was incredibly eager to learn all I could about? All it does is bring the total number of people who get to see the real ending when you don't up to two...You had me, Daniel Mullins Games! I swallowed your game hook, line and sinker! I was absolutely blown away by the writing, by the love and care you put into the game. There are three different sections, each with entirely different, brilliant graphics! The characters are awesome and the writing is so good you got me to feel for the guy who spent a very long time killing me again and again.
I saw a vision of a perfect world. One where all that setup led to an act where I discovered what the old data really was‚Äîmaybe it's the force that created the world of Inscryption in the first place, or the thing that traps the scrybes and their servants in the endless cycle of death and torture. One where I got to play Grimora and Manificus's version of the game, where I got to rescue my favorite characters from their horrible fates and restore Inscryption to its glory. Or at least tell the lonely wizard that I would literally die for him. One where I maybe even got to take my place as a Scrybe, one where the metastory of the game focused on ME, instead of that horrible Luke.
Oh no. Is it time to rant about Luke?
Do you want to know the one moment of the game that utterly broke my suspension of disbelief? The moment when the woman who showed up at Luke's door claimed she was a fan of his channel.
Guys. He's so boring. He's a terrible youtuber. His card-cracking videos are just him being like. ""This is a deck of a game. This is one card that was in the deck. It's not terrible. Next pack...."" I cheered aloud when he was shot, because I thought that maybe, FINALLY, I was going to get to play the game as myself, instead of being shoved aside so somebody I don't like can take credit for everything I do and the characters can form bonds with him instead of me. And what kills me is that they could have so easily just cut him out entirely and had the characters address you by name (OneShot-style) because his story adds literally nothing of value to the gameplay. He does NOTHING to influence the story and is only there so he can spookily dig up the game out of the woods, spookily pile dice onto a scale, and spookily get shot by a forever unidentified lady in shades. Tell me, Daniel Mullins, why did you think I would enjoy the game more if I wasn't the one playing it? 
I'm definitely going to replay the game, and I'm definitely going to skip the ending. And I'm going to spend the rest of my life mourning Grimora and Leshy and my dear, beloved Lonely Wiz, and dearly wishing their stories had been seen to a satisfying end.
For the love of god, Daniel Mullins Games, if you release a DLC with an act IV I will buy it literally no matter how much it costs.

- I enjoyed 49.9% of this game.
- I strongly disliked 50.1% of this game.

Some of the things that I don't like might be things that you like, so you may still want to get the game.

DISCLAIMER
I am a 51 year old female.
I don't like puzzles unless they are easy to figure out.
I am new to card games like this.
My only card game experience has been Slay the Spire.

I probably don't play games in the same way that most do.
I like to go through the game and have it not be too hard.
I enjoy seeing the art of the new creatures, etc. that are introduced as you play.
Appearance and aesthetics matter to me.

I downloaded a mod because Slay the Spire was way too hard and I wanted to see the creatures and go through the story. I loved Slay the Spire with the mod, but did not like it without it.

I am old and I don't want to spend nine years to 'git gud' as you may now be thinking of writing me.

I do not fully understand what 'Roguelike' means, but I think it means you die and go back to the beginning. If that definition is correct, I do not like that aspect of roguelike. 
I would like to be able to make game saves so I can go to a point and play with those cards again.

I am old and don't want to spend nine years playing through the same level and same creatures because my character died 9,678 times.

Tldr ‚Äì I am a card game noob and like shiny things.

DISCLAIMER COMPLETE

ACT 1

GAMEPLAY - PUZZLES
I liked a few of the puzzles, but was completely annoyed by others. 
They were too hard to figure out. 
Sometimes, using a guide was still difficult.

APPEARANCE
It looked generally good.
I know it was supposed to be horror, but I thought it was a little too dark - more light could have been added to the scenes.

GAMEPLAY
It was somewhat easy to learn the rules of the cards, but it was too hard for me.
I had to have help to beat one of the bosses.

GAMEPLAY ‚Äì MAP
I need tool tips!

I had to play with a separate screen open with the icons explained, because the icons were so cryptic and I still don't know what most of them mean.

There were a lot of things that were confusing to me.
I never figured them out until I had help.

I liked the creativity of the game in how they combined different things - the 3D and the video - but the story was too fragmented, so it took away from the creativity.

ACT 2

APPEARANCE
At first, I was not as horrified as others by the change in the look.
It looked...hmm...'good' for what it was supposed to be, even though it was a different universe of appearance from Act 1.
As good as that style can look, but not very interesting to my eyes.
but...

LENGTH
It was too long.
This would have been okay if it was for about five minutes as a link to go to the next act.
My eyes were not happy looking at that style for so long.

GAMEPLAY
I did not like the additional mechanics that were introduced. It was confusing and I had no idea what something was supposed to do. Also having all those cards would make the few gem cards I had meaningless, etc. 
The fights were easy enough that this did not matter.

I had fun fighting the dummy and overpowering my ouroboros.

I was not upset about this. It is an observation: 0% of this was scary.
It was cute.
If you wanted this for horror, you will not like Act 2 Cuteland.

ACT 3

GAMEPLAY - MAP: 
Walking around this map was incredibly irritating.
I had to have a huge map open on another screen because if I did not, I kept going back to the same place or getting lost.
A tiny map on screen so I could tell where I was would have been helpful.

APPEARANCE
The appearance of this map and its contents was not good.
Everything had lines through it and was like a ghost. Like an old TV display that was going bad.
I was squinting the entire time I was on the map and it strained my eyes.

Traveling through this map after my 9,678 deaths was painful.
I hope to never again visit this map or anything like it.

The fight scenes were back to 3D and this was fine, but still too dark like Act 1.

GAMEPLAY ‚Äì MONEY/MAP
Every time you die, your money goes into a bag and you have to find where it was left. Due to my map-following issues, I was annoyed trying to find it. This might be easier for males who usually have a better sense of direction than females due to their inherited abilities from being hunters in ancient times.

If you had a lot of money, you had to sit and watch a counter for what seemed like nine years as it rolled to zero. The same thing happens when you pick up the money! 
Since I died  9,678 times trying to get by this one boss mechanic, I spent nine years walking back through the ugly maze and then waiting another nine years for the money to get picked up!
Fabulously irritating. 
Please, just show the amount for a second!

GAMEPLAY
I never saw the hammer and played most of the third act without it, contributing to my 9,678 deaths.

Three minutes before game end...So cool! I can now make my own cards!
Wait! Now the game is over and I can't make them anymore!

ENDING
I did not like the ending.
It just seemed like a waste of time as I played games I could not lose.
The story was not completed.

Leshy and my OP ouroboros were the only interesting characters.
I forgot all the rest.
If you are going to have a story with characters, then take some time to make them interesting.

Heroically, I tried to start again thinking maybe something would be easier or I would have my old cards or something would be new and interesting, but no.
Back to the same cryptic map icons and bad starting cards, and I am done.",1700330772,1700330772,False,3,0,0.473323851823806763,0,True,False,False

I LOVE this game. Inscryption is addicting with its highly dynamic, easy to understand, hard to master gameplay. It is also perfect for those times when you have 15 to 30 minute intervals to play a game. 
I love the aesthetic of the entire game, although I understand people find Act 2 to people tonal whiplash. It isn't necessarily bad, just different. I have lost so much time to the challenge modes which you gain access to after beating the game. Mastering the challenges has been a fun journey and it was satisfying to finally finish it all. I am now looking to the community for more content, there are a lot of mods out there which flesh out the game more. Card games may not be your forte (it isn't mine either), but this game was able to get me hooked very quickly.

I will be as brutally honest as I was when I first experienced them long ago. I also replayed the game to make sure that my criticisms were still valid, so I will be taking that into account:
Act 1:
Act 1 is the delight that I was hoping it was going to be. I played the demo and was absolutely thrilled to see that it was everything promised and more. The difficulty is quite nice, but with recent updates, can be utterly shattered. Additionally, the requirement of a death after victory to beat the cabin puzzles is a bit cruel to someone who is replaying the game with the knowledge and skill that comes with it. All-in-all, great first time but poor replay ability unless you're intentionally bad at the game. The only critique I had on my first run through was that I had to replay the demo, but a small critique given the overall quality.
Act 2:
Absolutely my style, and I loved evrey minute of it. I loved the secrets, the style, the feel, and even the absolute terror you can cause with the legendary Oroborus! Sadly.... I didn't find any of these on my first run through. I didn't get the game breaking Oroborus, nor the obelisk, nor the Mycologist (because it just didn't exist at the time), nor the bone lords secrets, etc... Definitely better now, but lacking when I first played.
Act 3:
Okay, now for me to shit on the game. Act 3 was atrocious and horrible. When replaying the game, I had to abuse the Orobor-bot in order to speed run act 3 because I was that sick of it. The only good part of act 3 is the bosses, and the ending fair well. Literally no other aspect managed to intrigue me, even with the latest update. I didn't care for the Mycologist, or the Bone Lord, nor the fun/unique cards, nor the energy style cost system, nor the items, nor the room design, etc... This just wasn't it chief... If you know what is good for you, use Act 2 to build the Oroborus up, then use 4:00 on the clock puzzle to get it back in Act 3.
Kaycee's Mod:
A return to form for me, and a well-deserved one. I did a video on my YouTube channel called ""Why I continue to love a game I cannot beat"" which was all about the joys I was having with Kaycee's Mod. Yes, there is brutal and cruel RNG, but that is what you get in an alpha state. I have managed to beat it, and I still come back to experience more and more, because it is well worth it. I look forward to the changes here impacting the main game. One wish I had was that, since the player can handy-cap themselves for challenge points, perhaps a reverse system? Handy-cap Leshy, but at the cost of losing challenge points yourself. Might do well to balance the game.",1643327889,1700272141,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

THE DEMO IS BARELY ACCURATE

This game is not a roguelike/roguelite. It is a story game.

If you want a story this is a good game. if you want a mechanically fun card game, look somewhere else

The first act of this game is good fun, interesting mechanics, mysterious, and a fun to play card game with some roguelike elements. And then all that gets launched into the Bootes void. and is replaced by some very boring dragged out and predictable story. Act three has some kinda cool boss mechanics, but thats not enough too save the game from its mechanical blunders.

If you are familiar with Daniel Mullins games and enjoy them, then you will likely enjoy this game as well. However calling this game a roguelike, strategy, or puzzle game is just a lie. Only 1 third of the game can barely be considered a roguelike. while there is room for strategy, it doesnt matter, you can blindly choose whatever you feel like and will have no issues. As for the puzzle, maybe you could call some of them puzzles, but for the most part all the answers are handed too you on a platter. Maybe if you want to call the meta elements of the game a puzzle i can roll with that but once all that is solved its over, the game wont provide you with a puzzle experience.

Under the ""Daniel Mullins"" there is a decent base for what could be a really cool game. Unfortunately is buried under ""Stuff"".

Act 1 - 8/10
Act 2 - 0/10
Act 3 - 3/10

No one of those games holds a candle to Inscryption.

At its core, you have to know that it's a turn based card game, and that is going to be present through the whole game. So if you like that type of table top, old Yugioh-esque games, then you will love every second of it.

I personally don't really like that genre, but I played it nevertheless because every review says it's more than that. 

And it is. It is much more that a card game, and the ways that the developers have implemented a twist of so many genres and art styles is testament to that. 

If you like games that have a plot deeper than what you play, that will get you to go watch a YouTube video explaining all the things that you may have missed, all the stuff outside of the game that was meant to be found (as in an ARG game) and you like to be surprised, then this game is for you.

I abide by what all the other reviews say.

Go in blind, don't google anything, don't watch playthroughs, don't read any review that goes in depth about the story.

I should have trusted the Daniel Mullins seal of approval sooner - if anybody else is holding out because of the card game aspect, there's a *lot* of permanent upgrades as you progress and you can certainly brute force your runs over time, so don't let that hold you back. There is definitely deep strategy involved, but I've found it to be more fun than frustrating because of well the whole experience is pieced together (that said, there will be nearly indecipherable puzzles that you'll have to pick a random item to get hints on). Beyond the card game aspect, Inscryption really feels & plays much more like a ""choose-your-own-RPG"" game with very intrinsic world that continually develops the plot. This is definitely a unique experience worth trying.

Edit:
Everything I initially wrote was regarding Act 1. Unfortunately, the game really begins to test your patience in the additional acts by doubling down on all the frustrating card game parts. You'll be forced to re-learn to play (several times), RNG will decide most fights, and the puzzles will become more cryptic with less rewards. This could just be the difficulty curve, but it felt like it became increasingly more of a chore compared to the very strong beginning this game had where most decisions were rewarded with interesting plot developments like a choose-your-own-RPG adventure. It's a fantastic experience if you stop after Act 1, but I would be very hesitant to recommend any of it past that.",1698144733,1700055988,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

That is it. The card game as a unique mechanic of sacrificing weaker cards to be able to play stronger cards like a simplified version of Yu-Gi-Ho, but I've never played it so I could be completely mistaken. I particularly like this mechanic since it prevents the player from just choosing all of the best cards and calling it a day and gives the game a lot more replay ability since this is a card game and only a card game.

     Leshy's cold demeanor is a perfect mood setter that puts the player in a state of mind that there could be actual danger and consequences for when you lose, though that is of course a false sense that is intended by the game through clever world building. The game can not hurt you. The character of Leshy makes perfect chemistry with the quippy and funny characteristics of...well there is no one else in the cabin, so I don't really know where I was going with this.

     The game's mechanics get very compellingly expanded upon later on in Inscryption in ways that I would have never expected when they don't because the game doesn't expand on the mechanics since there is no later part of the game where there is anything. Anyone who says otherwise is wrong. They are all wrong. How many times do I have to say this. There is only this; let me have this.

The lore is very good and the way the game connect things is awesome, with different modes to play the game in Acts 1, 2 and 3, and then Kaycee's mod to provide more challenge (**cough** skull storm **cough**) and new content.

Furthemore, the card play itself is awesome, with many ways to combine cards, and different ways to play through the acts. This is the second game in which I got all achievements in steam, because for most games when I finish them, even when I liked them, they usually don't make me feel like palying again to do more stuff. This wasn't the case with Inscryption. I played the entire story twice and did all the achievements, and did all that because I really wanted to, not just to get the achievements, they just provided new objectives when playing it, and the funny thing is that while doing the achievements, I found some secrets and different ways of play that I had not found in the first run.

Overall, this game is magnific. The only cons I see is the RNG and that there's no way to customize a game the way you want. This could provide more end-game possibilities (choosing the cards you want, totems, abilities, etc..., although you can more or less have more freedom in act 3 if you have a lot of money, that you can get with a boosted ouroboros in act 1 or 2, that remains boosted in act 3).

The RNG sometimes make it that you end up with the worst cards (and you can only discard a number of cards in some places, so it's impossible sometimes to get bad cards), and when playing again you get the same cards (even when you go out and enter the game again). You can change the random seed in the game file to generate new cards, but this is something that I would prefer to have in-game (it's funny that I disn't need any of this when doing skull storm, but sometimes RNG really screw you, and unless you are fine with starting all over again, changing the random seed is the preferable solution IMO). 

There are some ways to make you have a specific card as long as it requires only 1 sacrifice, and it is the only one in the deck with 1 sacrifice (because you always get one 1-sacrifice card at the start of a game), but this can be difficult to achieve sometimes because you can't discard cards except in specific cases, and you also get cards as you progress, and sometimes you can't avoid getting a 1-sacrifice card.

I give this game 9/10. The story can blow up your mind, and the card game itself is very well done.",1699841510,1699841510,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Hands down the best experience I've ever had in single player gaming - and that's a high bar.

Preferably, go in blind... 

or don't... it doesn't matter... you'll still be surprised at every turn because Daniel Mullins is a genius.

Just when you think you've run out of content, the game surprises you with more.. and even after the credits roll, there's more digging yet to do. Every time you think a certain element of the game is shallow, it slaps you in the face with hidden depth that you didn't know could be hiding in such a humble package.

If the gameplay looks AT ALL appealing to you, you will love this game and then some - I assure you.

At the time of writing this, I have 34 hours in the game and I'm still finding stuff I didn't know was there. Anyone who questions the replayability of this game is nuts - there's just so much meat here.

I don't love it as much as some... I'm certainly not a fan of the way it deliberately obscures some of the rules and mechanics in a few places.. but at it's core there's a pretty neat card game which is fun to play, cloaked in a spooky and effective aesthetic. I'd prefer the rules to be smaller and tighter, rather than sprawling and varied, but that's just me.

Also I'm not particularly fond of the growing power level you experience in the base game, but Kaycee's Mod (Inscryption's answer to Slay the Spire's ""Ascension"" mode) addresses that issue.

I don't think there's any danger of this knocking Slay the Spire off the top of my favorite games list, but I can see why it does just that for a lot of people. Give it a go if you like that kind of game!",1698397695,1699621078,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Like many Devolver projects, many of the best things to say about the game also double as spoilers, so I will keep it light.

   Like many other Devolver titles, by buying this game you are buying a few games tied together by a very well-made through line. The mechanics of each sub-game are very well made and teach you important mechanics of each other game. If you like deckbuilders, try this one out. It's a fun card game to solve with multiple viable options. If you like collectible card games, try this one out. There's a ton of great card synergies for your deck. If you like Rogue-likes, you'll like this game. If you like Metroidvanias, you'll like this game. If you like ARGs, this game has a wonderful, intriguing story with many layers to peel open. And somehow, though the main game is best experienced as a first-time game, the developers still managed to put in an alternate gamemode which massively increases replayability.
   Now, if you're wondering how I could possibly liken all of those things to one game, I know for a fact you'll love Inscryption.",1699582654,1699582654,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The card game is just a pretext to dig deeper into the meta-story.

Update after having beaten it:
Sadly, Act 1 of this game sets the bar impossibly high, and the later acts do not measure up in terms of fun and replayability.  I wish I could just play Act 1 over and over and over.  (I guess technically I can just reset the game data in Settings and do exactly that.)

- Great card based game, card upgrades are good, not too many and not too few cards to use.

- Amazing visuals and audio, I like that the audio and visuals match perfectly with each Act of the game.

- Feels like a rogue-like in that you'll lose a lot, but there's a feeling of accomplishment when you get further than you did last time.


[b] The Bad (minor cons, just me nitpicking) [b]

- A secret boss is missable, and you require items from previous acts tobe able to access it.

- Some achievements require you to do specific things that're missable on your first playthrough, for instance [spoiler] in act 3 you hafta collect 5 rabbit pelts and give them to the Trader to collect 5 specific tarot cards from him. Of course I didn't know that, so instead of looking for the 4 locations where you can find trap to get a pelt from the rabbit jumping near it or a grinding for money to buy the rabbit pelts from the shop to get the required pelts, I rushed through the act and just spent all of my money on cards and card upgrades. The 5 specific tarot cards are The Tower, The Devil, The Fool, The Empress and Death, of course you could end up buying the wrong tarot cards and messing up the chance to get the achievement! [/spoiler]

[b] The Ugly (major flaws that ruin the game) [/b]

- Having Luke Carder talk while you're playing (you're supposed to be playing as him and seeing through his eyes) really ruins the immersion, and frankly the whole found footage parts of the game and Luke himself should've been removed from the game, it doesn't add anything to the game in my opinion!",1699395358,1699395358,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is very very well done with excellent twists time and time again and a very ""figure it out"" style of storytelling; I will say that I personally fell off pretty hard on the third act as I felt that INCREDIBLY weak especially after the start was so absolutely outstanding.

---- [100% Spoiler Free] ----

This is not a rogue-like deck building game. This is a creepy pasta-esque story focused game with card game elements as a narrative tool. It is generally made with care and skill, but while the first part of the story mode is outstanding, I regret playing through the rest to unlock the challenge mode.

The story mode starts of relatively easy, but keeps getting easier as you progress and therefore starts to feel boring and grindy at times. Except for the fights you're supposed to lose, I beat every single encounter on my first try, wasn't even close. When I bought the game, I thought it would be difficult due to the horror aesthetic (and people saying it's hard), so it felt disappointing when I found out you're basically the pharaoh from Yugioh, stacking your deck with literal god cards (yes, that strong). I understand that this decision was made, so bad players wouldn't be locked out of the rest of the content, I understand that playing OP cards is fun, but couldn't they have just given us a challenge mode from the start? Why am I, a card game/rogue-like enthusiast, being under-delivered by a game that advertises itself towards me as its target audience?

Part two and three of the game are purposefully not seen in advertisement material to surprise you. I have mixed feelings about those surprises and if I had known them beforehand, I would have greatly adjusted my expectation.

Overall, the game is still entertaining most of the time, but you can just quit the game after part one and get away with a less bland taste.",1699027285,1699380175,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

Overall, this game was an awesome first play-through. The fun graphic, sound, and game design all come together to produce a very enjoyable experience, while still being replay-able.

I really only ever had one main problem with the game, and that's that some noises, especially towards the end, were aggressively loud.

All was fine and interesting until the opponent tried to kill me like a frustrated game master tries to kill his player's characters by summoning without warning a (supposedly) unbeatable board. It ruined everything for me. Why would you struggle and fight if the opponent can just decide to summon an army and kill you whenever he wants.

I was feeling my opponent was being monstruous, but fair. He isn't. It's possible to win, of course. But it just ruined the atmosphere for me. I don't see why he wouldn't just do that every single time since he apparently doesn't care much about being fair.

If the atmosphere is gone, all that is left is the card game. It's a good one. But I was attracted to the atmosphere, not the gameplay mechanics. Now I lost interest.

Two years later I decided to give it another go. Beat Leshy, turns out I have some random puzzles to solve now ? A knife is supposed to be used to pluck an eye or whatever but just doesn't appear, also, the game is way too repetitive, I was already bored at the end of a single run. It's way too annoying to have to do it again just because I missed a puzzle. 

They definitely put a lot of effort in the packaging of the game but in the end it's just boring to play. Always the same thing. Also, the ""breaking the fourth wall"" stuff was already done to the bone, it's just predictable and not interesting. Uninstalled again.

Overall the experience is simply frustrating.",1641852232,1699313462,False,0,0,0.400000005960464478,7,True,False,False

Act 1 is the most enjoyable part of the game, though as previously mentioned, I think it is rather short and shallow compared to other games in the genre. The escape-room element of the game is a novel addition to the genre, and I enjoyed how the interactive elements impacted the card game. Kaycee's mod is a good addition to extend the experience of act 1 gameplay, although it does remove most of the interesting escape-room elements in the name of balance and replayability. 

Act 2 and 3, I merely tolerated and powered through to reach the ending, though it is nice to see various tweaks to the deckbuilder genre, even if they make the game less enjoyable. Yes, in the canon and lore of the game they are supposed to be ""less refined versions"", but outside of that you as a consumer of a game you purchased is still experiencing rather dull portions of the game which encompasses TWO out of the three acts so far.

Act 4 plays some of the remaining iterations introduced in act 2, but gameplay is so sparse that I don't think it's fair to judge how well thought out the mechanics are (I barely touched them in act 2 too), and without the interesting life or death stakes of act 1; Act 4 really mostly just cutscenes, with some interactive element that doesn't mean much, and then the game ends.",1699276881,1699276991,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The biggest issue in the game is that you're intentionally made to starve cards, since you can either choose to pull a creature or squirrel card at the start of your turn with the ""Squirrel"" cards being like a basic resource card. Meaning that you're at a constant net loss of hand size at each turn, leading to you quickly running out of playable cards. There's another resource of ""bones"", but since that requires other creatures to die first, it means that is also a constant resource loss. There's no equillibrium of resources. But your opponent does not have to abide by these rules at all, he does not have to sacrifice or use bones. He can just play cards to his hearts content with no restrictions. So you're at a constant power loss and he's at a constant power gain. The only thing you have up against him is that you can see his planned moves, but it doesnt help much when he starts his turn by playing 3 cards and you can only realistically play one or two. 

The game also looks bad, I'm packing a 3070 in my PC yet the game looks  like it cant decide if it came out today or 1998.

After reading some of the reviews, I think the best advice i took and want to give back out is that you should go into the game BLIND and refrain from looking up walkthroughs or anything that would spoil yourself of the experience. If you're a scaredy-cat like me, and is scared that this game is going to scare the **** out of you, it wont. It's more atmospherically ""scary"" than scary at all, no jumpscares, and I was actually having a lot of fun.

The game was very immersive, unlike many different roguelite card builders I've tried before. The story was actually very interesting and took me by surprise at every turn. A little bit of escape the room type of puzzles, and thrills/suspense. It keeps you wondering what's going to happen next. Just went you think the game is over, it's not. 

10/10 , I only wish I can play this game all over again for the first time. 

Don't read this next part if you haven't finished the game: [spoiler] I think one of my most favorite part is Act 3, when they accessed my files and used my own friends against me. I just really enjoyed that they always had a few elements of surprise at almost every turn, you almost never know what's going to happen next. I liked that it's unpredictable. At the finale end, I actually felt sad and bittersweet shaking their hands and saying good bye, I kind of wished the game wasn't truly over already. Now I feel empty and hope to find another roguelite card builder such as this again. [/spoiler] Thank you for the amazing experience. :')",1699163598,1699163598,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Then I realized I missed the kinda obvious [SPOILER] which [SPOILER] allowed me to [SPOILER], or so I thought.

At the end of [SPOILER], [SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER]. Against all odds, I was seriously enjoying this.

Then I unlocked the [SPOILER], and OMG WTF just happened. Did I just [SPOILER] the game ?!

The story, gameplay and even end-game content was quite enjoyable. Each run felt unique and enjoyable. This game goes above and beyond to immerse you in its world and story, there was rarely a moment where I felt like it was over explaining or babying the player with its story/gameplay.

There were moments of confusion, but I'd chalk that up as a skill issue than anything else. I'd happily recommend all of my friend's to try this game out.

[h1] SPOILER WARNING [/h1]
[spoiler] The twists of the story as well as in-game recordings provide a clear idea of whats going on while still sprouting questions for the player. It's a form of story telling I rarely see and had me on the edge of my seat. I was never bored during cut scenes or dialogue. One gripe I do have is moreso with gameplay than story. At times, you could come up incredibly unlucky or receive a totem battle thats nigh impossible to win. If you aim for specific synergies, its possible to really beat any and all modes. Such as immortal bee or immortal cat. If you try to be creative in Casey's Mod, there's a high likelihood of being punished for it simply due to luck. Lastly, I do wish you could make ""Custom Cards"" in Casey's Mod like you can in the story. [/spoiler]",1698951428,1698951428,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Inscryption is a phenomenal game that relies too heavily on twist-based Creepypasta tropes. The first act is fantastic, and the gameplay is phenomenal, but underdeveloped. Then, once you actually beat the game, it switches into a completely different game, and is now an oldschool pokemon style RPG with four dungeons. It kept core gameplay mechanics, but added new casting types which were RNG dependent and unreliable. The dungeons were alright, but you had to pick a single starter deck out of the four and commit to it, while obtaining cards of different casting types, each one exclusive to the dungeon. This made obtaining packs a chore, as I already had a powerful deck crafted that could beat the bosses after a couple of attempts -besides the wizard one, I had to make a new deck for him.- The dungeons had for the most part interesting but easy puzzles that I didn't mind too much. Once beating this, however, I'm now playing a version of Inscryption that is basically act 1 of Inscryption but without all the fun stuff. Instead of it being a grisly roguelike, with and eerie atmosphere filled with intrigue, it is a boring pathway walker. Where dying was unique and exciting in Act 1, deaths hardly matter but they make you walk all the way back to where you died to pick up your gold, new mechanics are barely explained, and mistakes you make affect your cards permanently. The casting system is changed from a unique sacrifice system to a hearthstone-esque energy system, and the cards are significantly weaker. I don't even want to finish it because Act Three is a slog. 
My advice:
Play this game, but don't beat it.",1698880141,1698880141,False,1,0,0.465587049722671509,0,True,False,False

The game consists of multiple parts (I wont spoil what happens) however, the changes between sections can feel a little jarring at first but every new section builds upon the beauty of the game. Each section brings a new twist on the established game play mechanics that keeps game play fresh and exciting. In my opinion I think that the first section of the game is the best as it has the best story telling aspects. Which is why after beating the game I like to run loops of the first section because it is that fun. If you haven't played this game yet do yourself a favour and buy it even if you haven't had much experience with deck builders.

1092790,149293223,76561198067157844,0,2,415,0,415,1698812731,"[b][u]The trailer is misleading.[/u][/b] The game shown in pretty much the entire trailer is only half of the game. STRONGLY disagree with other reviews which says ""go in blind, it's best that way""

For about 6 hours I had an absolute blast playing the first part, getting really into the atmosphere, music, art style, the roguelike parts, the escape room style setting, and so on, and if the game simply ended after that it would've been an instant recommend. Genuinely so much fun

Then they make a really strange decision to COMPLETELY change the game, keeping the card battler mechanics but changing all the other parts mentioned above that I was really enjoying. The part you see at about 0:32 of the trailer, for about half a second (the card battler board but as pixel art - literally blink and you miss it) is what the entire second act of the game consists of. To a player like me who isn't familiar with other card battlers, the game suddenly just falls off a cliff and stops being fun.

Even worse though, after talking to people who've played through the whole thing, the game's (shorter) third part has a feature which takes random file names from your computer and uses them as card names. I stream on Twitch as a hobby - there are files on my computer which, if they'd been used as names, would have immediately doxxed me and revealed extremely sensitive personal information about me. There's no option to turn this off. This is such a monumentally awful decision that I don't think I'm ever going to buy a game from this developer again

The meta, fourth-wall-breaking narrative is really not all that interesting. In the space of 20 minutes I went from ""this could be one of my favourite games ever"" to ""this is one of the biggest letdowns I've ever experienced in a video game"". There's an endless mode mod that I'd love to play but I'm not willing to slog through the second act to get there.

Since Steam requires a yes/no recommendation, I'm leaning more towards not recommending.
I followed the advice of the 90k+ positive reviews and played the game without doing any prior research.
I only saw that it is a very popular horror, card game from the tags and decided to buy it for Halloween, hoping for a scare.

So. How does Inscryption fair against those genres?

Card game:
It is first and foremost a deck-building, card game. A very easy one that can sometimes feel rigged based on RNG, which is never a good feeling. Sure, there are rogue-like elements to it. But the only times during runs that I really felt challenged was only on the first map of Act 1 because I hadn't had a chance to build my deck yet.
They introduce more and more game mechanics and card effects at a good pace as you progress through the game.
However, once you reach a new Act in the story, they throw away almost all previous mechanics instead of building on them.
It felt like such a wasted opportunity for the gameplay.

Horror:
There were exactly THREE moments in my entire ELEVEN HOUR play-through that were scary. THREE! IN ELEVEN HOURS!! Two of them were from [spoiler]self-mutilation[/spoiler] and one was [spoiler]a cheap jump scare[/spoiler] . And all THREE of them happened during Act 1, which I finished in just over 2 hours (little too late for a refund).
Act 2 completely destroyed the creepy atmosphere built in Act 1, and had zero scares.
Act 3 felt similar to Act 1 as it tried to repair the creepy atmosphere, except it was much weaker in scale and without a single scare. 
THREE SCARES! IN ELEVEN HOURS!!
This is abysmally bad for a ""Horror"" game.
If anything, playing Inscryption felt more like reading creepy-pasta on a bright, sunny day in the middle of a park that turned into a child-like fan-fic.



Now, I've mentioned Acts a lot in the review so I'll explain it a little. Without spoiling anything, there are 3 story Acts in Inscryption. Act 1 is what you see in all of the promotional material. It's a rogue-like, deck building game happening in an escape room scenario. It's a very interesting premise. BUT IT'S ONLY TWO HOURS LONG! Maybe even shorter if you're experienced in deck building games and puzzles! The majority of the game is NOT shown, and for good reason. Acts 2 and 3 are terrible. And a complete waste of time for the story as there is zero payoff/impact in the finale.
It just abruptly ends.

So, with all of these negatives, why would I still give it a neutral rating?
Act 1. Act 1 carried the game in terms of fun from the deck-building, rogue-like gameplay. It carried the game in the creepy atmosphere and (very limited) horror. It carried the game in story, because there was almost none of it and everything was mysterious. It carried the game with the unique premise of an escape room.
So the way I look at it, I spent $10 for admission to a creepy, 2-hour escape room with an easy card game.
Not a bad deal.

If all of the game development time spent on Acts 2 and 3 were instead invested it into expanding Act 1, I think this game could have been at least an 8/10. Maybe even a 10/10.

And I have one bit of advice for horror storytelling.
Sometimes, less is more.
The mystery is more interesting than the explanation.",1698817267,1698817267,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

When I decided to get it, I didn¬¥t look into any recommendations or spoilers because everyone here on Steam said to go in blind. And I can only say the same thing. It might be confusing at first, but youll understand the game quite fast and then it will grow into an obsession. 
What got me to get this game in the first place where its looks. Even if it doesn¬¥t look like it in the pictures here in Steam, the quality of this game is insane and it made me very happy. This game is the perfect combination of horror, riddles and a special kind of card game. 
If some know the game in the DLC of resident evil 7- it gave me the same chilly feelings at first. So that made me very very happy. 

I truly enjoyed the story behind it too and every mechanic that was involved in all 3 Arcs of the main game. 
Well done game that leaves you confused at first but once you start to understand the clues and hidden messages its just a genius game that only gets better. And you also only get better once you tried out some random things. 
The game allows you to try out those weird random ideas and mostly those also have an effect/make the game easier in some way. 


If you arrive at Arc 2, please don¬¥t stop though. I¬¥ve heard from a llot of people that they stopped when the game got ""weirder"" and changed it¬¥s vibe- but that¬¥s when the real story begins.

Also I went through the down ratings on this game and was surprised at the amount of people that didn't like the game after Act 1, if anyone is here who hasn't gotten the game yet, don't listen to them, it is great. The suspense to the ending was flawless. PS. make sure to watch every video clip, they really help build the story for the ending.

I am not exactly sure what happened but this game grabbed me under the rug and pulled me into an all day gaming session, with me completing the entire thing within 14 hours.

Right out of the gate, the premise is very intriguing. Left abandoned in a shack, a curious looking figure invites you to a card game called Inscryption and challenges you to complete his entire gaunlet of 3 stages, with lining up cards to deal damage and eventually return victorious. He lets you also explore the inner workings of the shack for some light puzzle solving. The cool thing about this is that both the shack and the card game work in tandum with each other, causing things to get affected in the card game and vice versa. It made the first few hours of the game especially interesting, because even if you're not too huge into card games, you still have an escape room puzzle solving element to look forward to. 
It also certainly helped the card game itself was a joy to interact with, and the rougelite elements kept it from being boring, making you actually think of deck builds. In general, the setup was well done and I loved the somewhat creepy atmosphere alongside it.

Tthe card game itself and the rules for it are really fun and are definetly the main focus. Act 1 starts out somewhat simple and devolves into a fun, slightly complex ruleset fitting for different playstyles. The Kaycee Mod acting as a rougelike of Act 1 you get to play after beating the game is a welcoming mode that I am sure I will check out more later. 


However, this is a Daniel Mullins game. There will be a twist in this game, and this came in the form of throwing the entire premise out the window to reveal there are actually 2 more different acts with slight variations of the card ruleset waiting ahead. Act 2 introduced itself as an 8-bit top down adventure game, with more card types being introduced. 

While I personally do not mind this change, the entire of Act 2 should have been kept in the same style as Act 1. I just feel it's a massive wasted opportunity to recontextulaise the creepy atmosphere of the shack with the other scrybes, as I would have much more preferred to travel in first person with those weird 4 directional movement options, in addition to the light puzzle elements in both Act 1 and 3. It would've made for a more fun and consistent package, especially since Act 3 returns to that same style. I don't know, it just feels like a twist for the sake of being one, and not because it does anything terribly interesting with it.

Speaking of, if you're expecting 4th wall breaks like in Pony Island, you won't get them as extensive as here, just remaining as a fun gimmick and nothing else. The game is played from a PoV essentially recording their lets play of Inscryption, residing as an actual phsyical copy in a floppy disk reader. You will not see him much either. The area of mystery outside the video game Inscryption is solidly made, though I wish you could interact with it more yourself, instead of having just prerecorded videos pop up every now and then. (They are still good and do lead you towards an ARG if you want to get into that more, I meant more inside the actual game itself, though I understand if that was not the focus.)

Regardless of the few negative points listed here, I still had a lot of fun playing this strange little card game for hours on end. Highly recommend!",1698607505,1698609365,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

I am a huge fan of Daniel Mullins Games. Enjoyed Pony Island with my friends and LOVED the mystery story behind The Hex. Now we enter my new favorite genre, roguelite card battler with a horror twist? Sign me up!

Like most of DM's Games, it is better for you to go in as blind as possible so you can get the full effect and mystery of it all. So I will only go over as little as possible. You awaken in a cabin and play a card game with some weird man. As he goes through the tutorial, you realize there are other places (and puzzles) to solve around the cabin, but you'll have to best him in the game to find clues as to what's going on. Some of the cards talk, there are some flashing lights behind a locked door, and the whole vibe is eerie. Can you figure it out?

Inscryption requires you to sacrifice weaker cards to summon stronger ones or to collect coins from fallen creatures. It may take some getting used to, but it's fairly easy to learn. Cards can also have special abilities called sigils that let them do cool things. It can be as simple as flight so they can attack over defending cards or having it so they switch lanes after attacking. It's incredibly fun and quite addictive once you get into the swing of things.

As stated earlier, there are also puzzles to solve around the cabin. Think of it like an escape room. You have to find clues to solve them and you will gain new cards and discover more lore as to what is REALLY going on in this game. I will admit that I had to look up a solution every so often, but it was also fun to figure out most of them on my own. I implore you to try to solve them on your own first before looking up solutions.

The horror aspect of the game is a great blend. I'm not a fan of horror games personally, but since this was more atmospheric horror and not jump-scare horror, it really made it more enjoyable. I loved the music and overall feel of the game and can even recommend it to players who may feel uneasy with horror games.

I personally had no gripes with the game. Most times when I lost runs was either because of bad card RNG or me not picking good cards. I loved unraveling the mystery the more I played and I do intend to beat it again to get more clues.

Final verdict? I cannot recommend this game enough. If you like roguelite card games with a dash of horror and puzzles, this is the perfect game for you. Like I said, I kept this as brief and concise as I could to prevent spoilers, so do yourself a favor. If you even just considering getting this, just do it, you won't regret it...Thanks for reading!",1698550157,1698550214,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,1,True,False,False

The review I wrote below is ignorant, uneducated, and downright wrong. After finishing this game I can confidently say that Inscryption is one of the best experiences I've ever had with a video game. I felt violated playing this, like the game knew who I was and that I was playing it. This game is a straight up masterpiece.

The only reason I'm recommending this game is because of act 1.

The first act is incredible. It's suspenseful, the animation and pacing is next-level, the art style, and the absolute creeps you get from staring into his eyes in a dark room. It's unlike any deck builder I've ever played and the actual card game itself is so simple yet complex (aside from high-cost cards being near worthless since the matches are so short and can be finished in literally a single turn if you have two 3/1 flyers). 

But I only wish the entire game stayed in the first act.

I have to give credit to the devs for making such an original and creative game, but act 2 and 3 simply can't compare to how good 1 is. Not because it's not good, but because you only get to play a few hours of the best part and are forced into pixel art after something that's incredibly immersive. It's not that pixel art is inherently bad (stardew is one of my all-time favs), it's just that the game subverts your expectation, but not in a good way - in my opinion, at least.",1659312383,1698379263,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It only took me around 3 hours to beat Act 1, and if I knew about how garbage the game turned afterwards I would've let the guy give me a personnel photo shoot again. Act 2 is simply not fun, no interesting mechanics, just reattempting the bosses over and over until you draw what you need to. The aesthetic of the game goes from what is advertised to being somehow worse than what RPG Maker could produce for the PS2. Honestly really disappointed with how it just seems like the game kind of tricks you into thinking it is this super deep Rogue-Like deckbuilder, then once it really starts to get good, pulls the rug from underneath you and says ""you already played for so long, why not keep playing even though we stopped caring.""

Its essentially a cross between 'Slay the Spire' and 'Gent' from the Witcher, with a few mini-puzzles thrown in and a darker atmosphere.  You build a deck and then card-battle with the bad guy, Leshy, and his minions. Death is inevitable but that's OK, you get resurrected and try again, it gets easier each time as you learn how it all works and maximise the power of each card. You also get hints and tips from some talking cards in your deck, and gradually solve the mini puzzles with their help. Eventually you will triumph over Leshy and feel like you've really earned it, I shouted 'YES!' and fist pumped when he finally fell. 

But then after you finish the first part the second part is truly terrible, a simplistic retro game from about 30 years ago, horrible music, graphics and game play. I gave up after ten minutes.

The content that you get for the price is a good amount and even after you have 100 percented the game you can still have fun replaying it. It is a mystery game mixed with roguelike elements and some puzzles along the way. The less you know about the game, the more fun you will have unearthing the different secrets and layers the game has locked away. Also the game has a surprisingly large amount of time before you actually reach the credits (took me 62 hours and I had watched a couple playthroughs and used some cheeky exploits in gameplay).

If you have seen some playthroughs or know a little bit about the game then this breakdown will be helpful otherwise these are spoilers that you should avoid looking at.

[h1] Review [/h1]
[spoiler] 
[h2]Act 1 - Best part of the entire game[/h2]
it has the most engaging content and feels fresh each time you play through it because of your new knowledge going into each run. This is perfection.

[h2] Act 2 - 3rd best part in the game[/h2]
I'm a bit split with this part because while it had fun parts in it with a god amount of puzzles it was slow at the beginning. This part really starts to flesh out the lore of the in game characters but the gameplay feels dissatisfying when compared to the first part. However, it was really fun seeing the characters especially [spoiler]goobert and stimulation <3[/spoiler]

[h2] Act 3 - This was more grating than when I put cheese on my pasta (I fucking love Parmigiano-Reggiano) [/h2]
This feels like starvation. It feels like you have little to no resources. This really doesn't change much the entire (what feels like) 15 hours of gameplay. There is really no problem if you die so the fights aren't high stress but if I had to play through that game much longer I may have just stopped playing. Also you wont get your files deleted; I checked and you're fine.

[h2] Act4 Cool and also haha funny [/h2]
This is a very brief part of the game and really just the main ending. Not much to say really except for te fact that I was so close to beating Magnificus (trust me).

[h2] Casey's Mod [/h2]
Casey's Mod has got it going on. It's all I want and I've waited for so long. I know it might be wrong but I'm in love with Casey's Mod.
But seriously Casey's Mod is a coin flip between best and second best part of the game. It won't feel as magical as your first playthrough of act 1, but it will make up for it with the amount of content both in new cards, mechanics, and difficulty modifiers as well as sheer length that it will take you to fully complete it.

[/spoiler]

[h1] Glitches that I've Found [/h1]
Note: I assume that you have played the game so there are spoilers in here.
[spoiler]
Take it or leave em but I think I should at least share them for both the devs and players to see. Really the only one is that you can re-pick a path choice if you click esc or tab and exit to the main menu and then continue back into your game.
There is some balance breaking cheese when it comes to play in Casey's mod.
     First and foremost, when trading your pelts in the very begginning, because it is the first spot on the map, when you reload the game the map reshuffles and so do the cards that you can trade for. This is the same ffor after each boss fight. You can reload the map to get a more ideal layout like an early goobert space. 
     Speaking of goobert, (amazing segway I know) you can reload his painting if you do it right. I havent really abused this too much because i think it takes good timing but it should be able to give you more ideal duplicates.
      When you are picking a normal pick 3 or a pick based on kin or cost, you can see what you would have gotten for each and take which one is ideal through this exploit. You can also do this for the trials with the dude in the cave (idk what its called).
      You can scope out different parts of a fork in the path. If you want to see what you would get in a woodcarver, you can. Also if you wanted to see what items you would have gotten if you chose the pack you can. Again you just go into the menu and click continue game.
      The combination between reloading the map and the fact that the final map before Leshy is the same each time means that you can really easily get an overpowered sigil for your totem. Knowing this can make the final boss the easiest part of the entire game.
      [h3]THE MOST BROKEN PARTS OF THIS GLITCH[/h3]

      If you are about to lose a fight you can instead reload the fight and try again. It is so easy and the timing is very lenient as well. Casey's mod is hard because you lose a lot but if you just use this exploit you wont lose unless your deck sucks.
[/spoiler]

Sorry for the verbal diarrhea, if you made it this far then you get the satisfaction knowing you did something unproductive idk. Just to sum up everything:

Rating: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ

Inscryption is a tour de force of game design, a triumph that defies easy categorization. It seamlessly weaves together elements of card-based strategy, psychological horror, and narrative storytelling into a tapestry of pure genius. From the moment I stepped into its eerie, enigmatic world, I knew I was in for something truly special.

The cards, the heart and soul of Inscryption, are a stroke of brilliance. Each one is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of the developers, offering a staggering array of strategic possibilities. The depth of the card mechanics is nothing short of astounding, allowing for infinite customization and ensuring that every playthrough feels fresh and exhilarating.

The integration of a captivating narrative within a card game is a feat that few could have imagined, let alone executed with such finesse. The story unfolds in a way that is both unsettling and enthralling, leaving me on the edge of my seat, hungry for every morsel of information. It's a testament to the narrative prowess of the creators that even the most cryptic elements of the plot are irresistibly compelling.

The atmosphere of Inscryption is a masterclass in evoking a sense of dread and wonder. The eerie cabin setting, the haunting soundtrack, and the enigmatic characters all contribute to an immersive experience that is as unsettling as it is captivating. Every creak of the floorboards and flicker of the candlelight is carefully orchestrated to keep players in a state of delicious unease.

The puzzles, both within and outside the card game, are a stroke of genius. They challenge the mind and demand creative thinking, adding a layer of depth that elevates Inscryption from a mere game to a cerebral experience. Each puzzle feels like a revelation, a testament to the designers' commitment to engaging players on multiple levels.

Inscryption's ability to surprise and subvert expectations is a testament to its audacious creativity. The twists and turns, the moments of shock and awe, are executed with a confidence and precision that is rarely seen in the world of gaming. It's a rollercoaster of emotions that left me breathless, craving more.

In conclusion, Inscryption is a magnum opus, a crowning achievement in the realm of indie gaming. It defies convention, challenges expectations, and leaves an indelible mark on the player's psyche. If you have even a passing interest in card games, storytelling, or just experiencing something truly extraordinary, Inscryption is an absolute must-play. It is a masterpiece of twisted brilliance that will haunt my thoughts long after the cards have been dealt.",1660078494,1697344781,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

After i beat the game which was also really fun I just kept replaying the first chapter. Its very fun to create strategy mix and match cards and get hyped when i find a death card as well as make a perfect play. I only wish that it was harder to beat the first chapter sometimes cause it feels like no matter what i do there is always a way to win. Even if i make dumb choices sometimes and get crappy cards its pretty easy to win mostly. To be honest i just try to play faster sometimes.

First off, I would recommend going in blind if you're into a game that will surprise you. If you need the essential review, it's an entertaining enough card game with a lot of good twists in there. The gameplay isn't immaculate but if you're down to put in a little brainpower and some outside-the-box thinking, you'll have a good time.

But I have to give credit where due, this is one of the games that followed me for a while even when I wasn't playing it. After beating it for the first time, it feels as if there's tons of secrets in here, so much so that while the game was very fun, I don't feel like I got a complete story. I'm interested in seeing what the community digs up in terms of hidden content, easter eggs, and whatever else the devs kept well enough hidden from us that they knew we weren't gonna catch it the first time... if it's in there. If it's not... it's a somewhat hollow, if spooky, story.

Not a perfect game, but a solid 4/5 after my first run, which took about 11 hours. Still an easy indie GOTY contender. I'm not too much into card games myself but I still had a lot of fun.",1634960200,1696990054,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

NO SPOILERS:

The Good: I had no idea what to expect and I was very pleased. This game takes you down a strange path, with attention to detail the entire way. If you enjoy card games or general strategic play, you will have a fun time progressing through it. 

The Bad:  This game is enigmatic in it's reveal of the 'deeper' story. Even after finding extra secrets and puzzles to unlock hidden lore, I had no idea what was being alluded. However, I don't mind too much because I don't need a full understanding of the situation to enjoy the experience. After all I just finished Returnal.

The Ugly:  Kevin Saxby's performance was off the mark for the tone of the game. But I assume there was no acting director to guide him so I'll blame that for his short falling of performance.

So many weird ideas, complex tricks, surprises, twists... you won't feel like this game takes the 10-15 hours to beat (not counting challenge runs) because it will honestly fly by.

Pros - Awesome concept, super cool art, very engaging story, tons of things that make you feel like you as a player have options.

Cons - the actual card game... isn't good. I've played a lot of card games, and this isn't a great one. The enemy doesn't follow any set of rules, so while you have to sacrifice or build energy, or whatever, the enemy just... does. They can put down an enemy on round one you would only be able to use on round 5. They can spawn multiple enemies whenever they want however they want. They have no energy, no sacrificing, nothing you have to do to summon and use cards. This is doubly frustrating because they have many of the cards you do, so while you struggle to find and summon a card, they can just... have a broken card whenever they want. If you are fighting a boss, rules go entirely out the window and the game follows a ""You'll probably die first try because you didn't know the boss could turn all your cards into exploding fish cocktails when you beat his phase 1"".

Once you do finally get a deck you like, the game changes and you basically reset and play a new, different, often worse, card game. Deck resets, kind of the same game but with new different rules. It's widely known in the later parts of the game you can just break the card came and pretty much autowin. In fact, the game is pretty poorly balanced. It's usually either struggling or crushing the opponent, and because they follow none of the normal rules, the feeling you would get from a normal card game like MTG, doesn't apply. Strategy is a case by case basis because you don't know what the AI will do (four enemies that explode on round 1? A guy that can do 3/5 of my life before I can respond?)

It's a good game, worth the price, but I feel weird saying it because the actual core gameplay, the card game, is just not well made. Or at least, choosing to let the AI not follow the rules makes it bad.",1696368513,1696368513,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

So this game was recommended to my by quite a few people since its release in 2021. Almost everyone I who played this game didn't want to talk about it that much in order to not spoil the plot. Well after watching some trailers and gameplay I thought I would give it a shot. [i] Deckbuilder meets Horror/Thriller? [/i] Count me in!

So after launching the game for the first time I am greeted with a really well made spooky, intriguing and fun setting. You are placed in a dark cabin in the woods with no information or clues of how you got there whatsoever. All you know is you need to play a card game against this mysterious man on the far side of the table.

[b] Let me make it clear that everything in act 1 is so incredibly well done! [/b]
Soon some of your cards start talking to you. You notice you can stand up from the table and move rather freely in the cabin you are held hostage in. There are a few puzzles there that give of a very interesting escape room vibe.
So you play, talk and puzzle your way through the mysteries presented to you. Every riddle solved only leads to further questions in your head.
All in all this part of the game is incredibly fun to play, solve and listen to.

[i] Sadly this only lasts for 3-4 hours. [/i]
After you defeat the old man you are presented with more information about the game and its story. Still great and captivating btw.

And then starts act 2.
The entire game you fell in love with in the first 4 hours is just [b] gone [/b].
[spoiler] You are now playing top down in a zelda/finalfantasy/stardewvalley-esque artstyle. The plot is kinda gone and you need to again get your bearings on what is happening. The gameplay itself is a card game again. Although very dumbed down from act 1. There are some new mechanics introduced but they really pale in comparison. 
So you battle your way to 4 main bosses in order to defeat them and replace one of them as scribe. All 4 boss ""areas"" are similar in esscence, thus getting boring really fast.  [/spoiler]
Someone played the first Assassins Creed? Get some informations 3 times -> kill main dude -> repeat.
This is fine to do if the gameplay is really fun, but not otherwise.

[spoiler] Sadly act 2 gameplay is really RNG in the beginning and once you get enough card packs it becomes too easy too fast and the whole story progressions gets tedious. Also the ""puzzles"" in act 2 are way easier than in act 1. Whereas act 1 had you wondering about the purpose of certain things act 2 is basically just: get hint -> go solve -> repeat, without any need to think about the puzzles.
To say this whole ordeal was a slog is putting it mildly. [/spoiler]

[b] However, this part only lasts for 1-2 hours max. So while I personally really didn't like it at least it was over quite fast! [/b]

[spoiler] So you beat all 4 bosses, return to the start and battle 1 final boss. Actually I am not sure at this point if there are different outcomes depending on who you choose/how you play out the battle, but the plot felt very forced to me.
>> I chose to replace PO3 and failed (?) the battle by attacking the corrupted card he played (had a mantis with 3-strike beside it and no way to sacrifice it).<<

So after a short cutscene, that really should have a epilepsy warning, you are now in act 3.

As of now I have only sunk about 50 minutes into this next act. It is, as was act 2, very different from the act 1 I liked so much. In short, almost 50% of what I played so far wasn't act 1 material. And neither act 2 not act 3 are fun to me. There is no mystery anymore, except from wanting to know how luke carder ends up in the end. Although he will probably get shot since that is what was being hinted at at the beginning of the game..
I really don't know if I will finish this game, since act 3 seems to be more of what I hated about act 2. [/spoiler]

Also I don't want to be that guy since I understand the novelty in having different games in 1 game which you, the consumer doesn't expect. However since way more than 50% of this game doesn't resemble the marketing material this is kinda false advertising?
I guess I won't be returning this game since I can respect the design decisions made by the developers. However as of now this game is just not for me since I can't be bothered to sit through multiple hours of gameplay I don't like, to watch an ending I can kinda predict.

[b] So as I said. Interesting game, objectively well made and thought out. Just not for me.
Also you should refrain from buying the game based solely on marketing material from act 1. I would have actually prefered some minor spoilers before buying to be sure act 2 and 3 were also something I enjoy. [/b]",1696340486,1696340486,False,30,2,0.657181143760681152,2,True,False,False

The immersion here is world class, especially for the first act. The art style, sound design and atmosphere created one of the most immersive tutorials I have ever experienced. Its vivid, captivating and played on a few horror elements. The immersion and world building is by far Inscryption‚Äôs strongest card and this holds true throughout the rest of the acts. Sadly, the actual card game here can only be described as shallow and a little tedious, and its shallowness only increases the further in you go. The first act was fine but it was pretty obvious that the further in you go its intensity only increases, if you are buying Inscryption for its cards you might be disappointed. But none of this really matters because Inscryption isn‚Äôt really a card game.

Trying to explain what makes this game so special would be doing it a disservice. Inscryption plays on the element of surprise, more than any other game I‚Äôve ever played. Explaining its narrative would ruin it but in short it curbs your expectations and wants you to feel -Ã∏ÕöÃØÕì ÃµÃ™Ã≤ÃòÃü Ã∑Õá Ã¥Ã≤Ã´ÃüÕúÕñ-Ã∑ÕÖÃñÕáhÃµÃ†-Ã∂ÃóÃñÕôÃ±'Ã∑Ã∫Ã•Õô\Ã∂Ã©Ã†Ã§Ã¶Ã©eÃµÃ±Ã©,Ã¥Ã≠|Ã∏Ã©ÃüÃ§,Ã∑ÕçÃúÃßÃ°Ã±lÃµÃ¶Ã©Ã®ÕöÕá\Ã∏Ã∞Ã±ÕçÕâ\Ã∏ÃØ>Ã∂Ã≥Õô'Ã∂ÕàpÃ∑ÃôÕö'Ã∂ÃúÕéÃù¬®Ã∂Ã©ÃØ¬ßÃ¥Ã® Ã∂Ã¢Ã∞ÕîÕúÃπ Ã∑ÃñÃ©ÕÖÕïÃ´-Ã∂ÕâÃ®ÃªÕç Ã∂ÃúÃôÃ°Õé Ã¥Õñ ÃµÃú

I started playing Inscription about a year ago and got through most of act 3 until the game erased all save data just because I wanted to change my game language.
I don't understand why the ""Delete Save Data"" button in settings gets 3 extra confirmation messages, while changing the language only takes one click. It didn't help that the dev team didn't respond to my email. Considering this is a UX/UI issue and can be simply fixed with a popup window. 
So after the initial shock and grief I left the game alone for a year until I picked it back up recently because it took me this long just to feel fresh enough to restart.

TL;DR the game reset my saves because I wanted to change the game language. Got so sad I left the game for year and got back just recently and finished the game cuz it is a really phenomenal game.
