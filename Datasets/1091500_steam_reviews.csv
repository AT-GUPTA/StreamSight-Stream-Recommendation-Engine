pros

V good graphics.
Good story with plenty to do.
NPC character interaction superb and interesting (unlike Starfield) !!!
I will definitely have a 2nd play through on a different character if it has its own story too.
Lots of side quests.
Combat in normal is nicely balanced for someone that is not great and strafing jiggling about in FPS / dodging etc.
Did I say the graphics are gorgeous to look at ?!

cons
It crashes quite often - I am not used to games crashing |(by often once every 2-3 hours I am guessing). Its not my system which is high and and well up to date (ryzen 9 64GB RAM rtx4090)
Graohical lock ups rather than a full crash of the game but same issue and on 3 occasions with this I have had to do a full reboot of my system after force crashing the game.

Other than that I do not have anything else negative to say about it at this point !!!

The story line is very good, it has a very delicately written story. I don't know how much of an impact the values it inspired have on this, but it really has a story at the level of a high-level movie. To compare, the story is much better than GTA 5, and may even be better than the GTA 4 series (3 episodes). As for the game mechanics, the mechanics of motorcycling and some of the vehicles are really bad. But as the vehicles get better, the mechanics get better. (I don't know, maybe they did it on purpose so that it would be obvious that you switched to a good vehicle). Apart from that, there are many innovations in the game. They worked hard, even the quality of the side missions is top notch.

I originally skipped out and overlooked on Cyberpunk 2077 from its initial launch in 2020 because it didn't look as appealing and interesting to me at the time. However, I decided and recently bought it at the end of 2023 on sale. I have to say it is a very good game. The stories and quests are interesting and the amount of customization options and stuff you can do in the game, is basically up to your desire and there's generally no limits. To me cyberpunk 2077 is like GTA but set in a futuristic city/world. Your able to do jobs to make money, go to clubs and hang out, and customize your character however you want. There's just a ton of stuff available to do!

What finally sold me on picking up Cyberpunk is finding out about the many mods from cars, to character customization options that are available to download by excellent and talented mod creators. I am having a lot of fun going around and doing jobs, interacting with people in the world and sometimes battling with the police and enemies, and also driving around my car collection. The environment and photo mode options are great too. 

If you played GTA or similar games and like open world style games or are like me and just want to do as you please with no set limits or structure involved, I highly recommend picking up Cyberpunk 2077.",1708844410,1708844410,True,11,0,0.574931740760803223,8,True,False,False

BEFORE

I've quite enjoyed playing Cyberpunk 2077 at a discount but I can't be positive given how much it has missed on expectations. For me, the overall short lifetime, weak combat system & difficulty progression (seeing how easily I smashed Adam Smasher), Night City empty as f*#k where it isn't a pleasure to to chase secondary missions, were the main frustrations. 

AFTER

CD Projekt finally got to finish their masterpiece. I must say that v2.0 is really bringing life to this title.

If you like the genre, you won’t be disappointed with this game. The scope of this game should be commended. It looks great. The atmosphere is the strong point in this game. I felt like I was in blade runner. This dystopian futuristic world is ruled by corruption, gangs, and corporations and the map is huge. V is also a great, witty main character. 

I’m going to keep this review relatively short because honestly, this is not my genre. These games leave me with decision paralysis and lack of direction after the main story line is done. Some people love it, I’m just not one. I beat the main story in about 25 hours, but if you want to max everything out in this game, I can easily see it taking another 50 hours. 

The Good:
Like I said, the atmosphere is top notch. They nail the setting. Dark, misty, robotic, desperation, cooperate, rough, survival, futuristic, are all words that come to mind. The game is worth it just to experience the open world CD Projekt Red has created. 
Characters feel real and unique. They have their own motivations and personalities.
I didn’t run into any bugs, despite this game having an infamous buggy release.
Lots of side quests that feel good to complete, are fast, and aren’t overwhelming. 

Decent:
The combat was okay, too many health bars and too much screen planning for my liking. I didn’t like the cloaking abilities that some enemies have, or the large number of enemies that just run away. But there are a lot of options about how to fight. There were melee weapons, ranged weapons, snipers, quick hacks (my favorite), sneaking and assassinations, taking control of turrets. They were all decently fun. 

Bad: 
The main story line was confusing. It took too many twists, and had too many characters involved, by the end I didn’t feel connected to any of the decisions I was making. I won’t spoil any of it, but I’ll just say, they went for a detailed story, too detailed. I wish the factions were a little better defined, and my options were a little clearer about their ramifications. 

In conclusion, I bought this game on sale for $30. Definitely worth that price and probably worth full price. I don’t regret going through it for a second, but one time is probably enough for me. If you are looking for an open world RPG and are sick of the over saturated medieval fantasy settings, look no further.

When you put bodies down - enemies could see them through walls; cops were invincible and would be triggered over literally nothing.  NPCS would eerily stand there like a T for no reason.  

Well after 2.11 and the DLC, this game has totally 180'd.  It is beautiful and immersive; the character builds are fixed and more balanced.  It is a total improvement over the game at release.  

I am on my second playthrough.  First game I played as a netrunner and I was clapping baddies through cameras and melting their brains from far away on hard mode was pretty good.  This playthrough I'm using the sandevistan, freezing time and throwing knives at the bad guys on very hard mode.  

I have noticed that on very hard some of the boss-ish battles are pretty impossible.  Trying to hit enemies while other people are driving (little battle cutscenes) are virtually impossible without first max perking some of the skill trees.  Still this plays like a totally different game since the 2.11 update.  

I didn't play right after the 2.0 update; so I'm only making the comparison from release to 2.11; it's the difference between night and day.  If you refunded because it was horrible at release you should try it now.",1708814145,1708814234,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'd lie if I said that the game doesn't offer anything good, it does. The world, the map, the characters (at least some of them), the music, it all clicks because this is the content that was initially designed before CDPR decided to rewrite everything from scratch, half-assing everything from now on. Unfortunately, this is FAR too little to consider CP2077 a good game.

The negatives however are everywhere. The gameplay is horribly repeatable, you can feel the content filler with every single step you take, going through uninteresting and outright boring ""gigs"" and ""NCPD activities"" that all play the same. Everything that was showed in the trailers and demos was fabricated, the world is empty, the content was cut horribly to the point that the game looks like it required another 2 or 3 years in development just to fill all those holes, let alone fix the bugs. The main story started with a bang, I noticed the amount of polish and effort that was put into the beginning of the game, which is on-par with the main quests of Witcher 3. However, the moment we start the whole biochip journey, everything looks like half-assed attempt to meet the deadlines and not bother about user experience. It's clear as day that this is where the real content made by ex-W3 devs ended, and the new vision of the project begun, the one which forced Keanu Reeves into the picture because of marketing deal, and not because he actually fitted for any role in what was originally planned. It felt exactly the same like beginning of Mafia 3, which also started with a bang, leaving a smell of ♥♥♥♥ for the remaining part of the game. If you ask me, I have no clue why CP2077 has better rates than Mafia 3 had, it has exactly the same problems, exactly the same empty world and exactly the same boredom.

I've finished the whole game and explored everything that game had to offer in order to review the whole product. No patch will fix severe lack of content caused by extreme cuts and half-assed execution of remaining part. You have only one attempt to make good first impression, and the impression of Cyberpunk looks like a game focused on meeting studio management expectations, tight deadlines and forced marketing, rather than offering quality product for your own enjoyment. It's definitely not the worst game I've ever played, but it dropped far below my expectations, which were already non-existent, as I knew that the game won't be anywhere close to Witcher 3 quality, yet even with that approach I didn't expect a game to turn out this bad. Considering the size of the studio and how many people were actually involved into whole this mess, I won't be as forgiving as I was e.g. with Mafia 3, as I really believe that CP2077 isn't a good game in terms of the content and gameplay, and the price tag doesn't reflect the quality of the product.",1708677647,1708807845,True,5,0,0.60000002384185791,0,True,False,False

Definitely recommended.

Updated three times, after 80 and 110 hours + at the end, 121 hours into the game:
This is one of the best games I have played. Probably not ever, but definitely in the last few years to a decade. The story is solid, the gameplay elements are solid, the setting is solid, the atmosphere is solid and the graphics.. even on my 5 year old PC it varies between awesome and jaw dropping with a perfectly playable FPS... (subjective opinion)

Full disclosure though: if you are sensitive to minor issues, like animation glitches, sound glitches or the likes, I recommend to wait a few more patches, probably a DLC or two for the game to be ""fixed"". They are not game breaking mind you, I am having a blast, but they are noticeable.. so if those break it for you, you have been warned.. otherwise, you will have a blast.

Some more details from the original review:
Technical:
If you do not use ray-tracing, the game actually runs well on high-ultra settings in 1440p even on a 1080FE. I have not actually measured FPS, but I can tell you this: I have not really felt a stutter or degradation in my experience.

Gameplay wise:
It is awesome. The game has so much content, that after 20+ hours of actively chasing quests, I have yet to make any real progress in my main quest line. The gun-play is fun, though at times enemies feel bullet spongy, which is a bit against Cyberpunk canon, where shots are supposed to be more lethal. Cybernetics are done in a way that blends into the game really well. There is somewhat scary about hunting cyber psychos with superhuman evasion, dodging your bullets like Neo from the matrix. :) The hacking in the game is also meaningful and blends well into the whole game-play.

My first real gripe with the game is the GTA-esque vehicle physics, where they seem to have too much mass compared to world object and they pretty much handle like speedboats on water. The other is the inventory system. For a game that focuses so much on looting everything around you, the inventory system would really need some beefing up to make it easier to manage. It is not horrible, but far from being great either.

There were some funny glitches I have observed and the enemy AI is not particularly smart at times either, especially if you ""exploit"" their easy to spot weaknesses, however at that point, it is more on you than on the game. If you play the game straight, the AI will pose a sufficient enough challenge and you will die if you are careless. :)

The game does a good job with auto saving and the save-load mechanism is actually quite well done and easy to manage.

When it comes to the RPG elements, I cannot yet tell how much of the dialogues have meaningful consequences behind them on the long run, but the world is full of lore and tidbits of info, either funny or just interesting that you can find in all kinds of places.

Overall, I tend to call this GTA: Night City or GTA: Cyberpunk ed. It of course has substantially more RPG elements, like attributes and perks and more dialogues with NPCs, but at its core, the game plays and feels like a GTA game would and with you mostly running or driving around in a big city, I think you will agree it feels very similar :) 

This is not a bad thing though, GTAs are great in their own right and Cyberpunk takes that formula to the next level through its unique setting and RPG elements.

UPDATE @ 80 hours
Still going strong, I reckon I am at about 2/3 of the content now :) At least that is my guess based on the remaining map markers. The story in the game is extremely good. Even the side gigs have variety to them in how you approach the problems they present.
- 1 CTD at around the 65 hour mark, graphics crash. Apart from that, rock solid.

UPDATE @ 110 hours
I am through with the gigs and crime events :) now its only the side missions and the main story left. Did a count, done more than 200 quests (gigs, side jobs or other activities) so far. Man there are some good stories in this game.
- Got 1 weird graphical glitch after an accidental windows update past the 1.05 patch (power outage forced my PC to restart, allowing windows to ninja-update on me). Driver update fixed it though. No hard tech issues since the freak CTD I had earlier.
- Noticed some strange sound artifacts as well lately, as in: sounds getting stuck.. reloading or quitting and reloading usually fixes it. Not frequent mind you, I think I have encountered it twice so far overall and only really noticed it the one time, as it was a very strong music sequence that got stuck on a loop :)

Final Entry @121 hours later:
I am done. The game is a masterpiece of storytelling. I didn't realize until the end how much the story got me, but it actually brought tears into my eyes when I finished. A fitting end to an epic and awesome story.
The variety in endings and how many of the things you do throughout the game influences them in subtle, yet meaningful ways is actually kinda awesome.

It has been a miracle for me to finish the game at all, as I almost never have the patience to play a story based game for this long, let alone replay them, but I can tell you this: if there is ever a story based game I would consider replaying, it is this one, just to see how I can make the story take a different shape.

DLC Entry: @250+ total hours
I binged the game for another 130 hours straight. The revised mechanics and UI are a lot better than they were at launch. If the game was a skull sized rough diamond back then, with the DLC, it is now a polished, cut piece of gaming history.

The DLC adds a meaningful, separately playable, yet also well integrated addition to the base game, As for the base game itself, it was still as good as when I first played it. Enjoyed every second. It did not evoke the same emotions, but that's not surprising for a replay, I still got misty eyed at certain points, which says a lot.

As he navigated the neon-soaked streets of Night City, he found himself deeply connected to the game's richly diverse characters, each embodying the essence of bravery and authenticity in a world that often demands conformity. This connection went beyond mere gameplay; it sparked a realization in Caleb about the importance of living one's truth, no matter the societal pressures outside the digital realm. Witnessing the fearless expression of identity by the Cyberpunk characters inspired Caleb to embrace his own identity and come out as an active member of the LGBT community. He shared his truth with us, inspired by the resilience and determination of the characters he admired in the game. This act of bravery was a testament to the game's impactful narrative and its ability to resonate deeply with its players on a personal level.

The game still has minor bugs, their worst harm being to immersion, but it's unfair to accuse the devs of laziness or carelessness. It's absolutely a product of blood, sweat, tears and love.

Taken as a marker chaser with shootouts and filler, much of its wonder is easy to miss. The lifeless feel of Night City's outskirts, a sense of overextension and regret; a borough that tried but just didn't get the biz to keep it breathing. How different the inner city feels after sharing your time and your heart with the nomads outside the city. The incessant commercials are just noise, the lights are just lights, the architecture's colours are bright but starkly artificial. How long before it draws me back in? How long before I'm trying to flatline some big shot gonk for a backstreet fixer and trying to ignore the casual, neon-bathed exploitation of it all? Then I get a call. Judy needs my help. She helped me out with a gig and now we're in something together. We got close. After all I've been through, I trust her. I drive to her place and... Oh god. Not long.

I played on release and was captivated by the game regardless of the issues it had. I've always appreciated the underlying beauty of the game. It has come a long way since then. And with all the improvements, the DLC, the story, missions, side missions, characters, Johnny Silverhand, cyberware, world design, music, combat, stealth, skills & everything else it has to offer, Cyberpunk has earned the spot in my Top 5 favorite games of all time.

The Graphics on Ultra are easily the best I've seen ever and are probably the best things about this game. While I did run without RTX in the majority (95%) of the game. Graphics still were amazing and next gen. [h2] Graphics are 10/10 [/h2]

The Story while is short is still good and I enjoyed it. I just wish we did some more crazy stuff but at the end it is a battle against time. [h2] Story 7.5/10 [/h2]

The gameplay (specfically the gun play) is something that I loved and while it does start off to be bullet sponge, the more you level up and progress, the less of a bullet sponge it is and I have found it to be enjoyable. The Skills are also good and balanced, I ended up being a jack off all trades and superior at nothing so it's my fault but again skills are good and balanced.
Hacking is also simple and easy to learn but hard to master. There's also crafting of weapons but I never did any of that. You also get a lot of loot (weapons mostly) and when you sell them you get a lot of Eddies in the long run. [h2] Gameplay is an 8/10 [/h2]

Missions I've had no problems with in regards to being ""boring"" or ""repetitive"". The side missions such as NCPD scanner and the GIGS did become a bit of a chore to finish but I took breaks and finished it so I won't complain too much. [h2] Missions 7/10 [/h2]

I think the game Overall deserves an 8/10 and a big fat recommendation from me 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍

Side note: Optimization leaves a bit to be desired as running without frame gen on any graphical setting seems to not go above 120/130 fps on a 4080 and i7 14700k. But [b] enabling [/b] DLSS Frame Gen fixed it and I got 250+ fps in general.",1708776988,1708777157,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Story wise it was incredible, well written, nicely delivered.

- Side quests need better integration, if you skip them you'll miss a significant portion of the game

Cyberpunk should have been release with the 2.1 version. This should have been the version we got at release. The DLC and the revised 2.1 Cyberpunk are amazing. It is at a stage where i can finally recommend the game without felling guilty. 

We can't change the past, we can only appreciate what we have now, the preset Cyberpunk 2077.

I think Cyberpunk is a very good game, but I don't think it's a truly ""great"" game (in the ways that, say, Halo 3 or Skyrim are truly great games). It's obviously a very ambitious project, and I think it comes 75% of the way towards realizing that ambition (which is saying something). The gameplay is fun but not groundbreaking, the world is incredibly (in some ways ridiculously) detailed yet is still obviously artificial and somewhat dismissible, and the characters are fun, flavorful, and engaging yet don't quite reach the level of ""aliveness"" that the game is shooting for.

I think what attracts me to Cyberpunk (the game) is that it's a love letter to, well, cyberpunk (the genre). It clearly references and draws inspiration from almost every classic cyberpunk book and movie I can think of, and when I play the game I almost — almost — feel like I've stepped into my favorite cyberpunk stories. I think that if you like sci-fi, first person shooters, or open world games, you will probably like this game. I think that if you aren't naturally drawn to these genres then the game won't really convince you otherwise.

On more of a ""what-if"" note, I think that the game did actually have the potential to be truly great, but its scope was its downfall. The open world they mapped out for themselves is just too big, there are too many characters and side-quests, the level of realism they strove for was too high. I think if CD Projekt Red nixed one of these goals from the get-go (probably the insanely-huge world) and fully committed themselves to a more curated but deeper experience, the game would be truly groundbreaking. As it stands though they have done a truly impressive job, and as I said, the game is very good. I think it has probably achieved a measure of immortality on the level of, say, No-Man's Sky.",1708749444,1708749444,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

There may be multiple ways to infiltrate a building or multiple avenues of attack, but at the end of the day, it's just, go here, then do one thing, done.  It simply was not satisfying.   And 2) the game is remarkably easy.   The quick hacks are cool but combined with weapons, cybernetics, grenades, and everything else, the game just became too easy.  And I was playing at the hardest difficulty.   Nine out of ten times I could defeat all the enemies anywhere without losing more than half my health.  The only legitimate challenge I regularly faced was a team of ~10 Arasaka soldiers randomly showing up to ambush me.  All the other missions and gigs were a complete walk in the park.

500 CHILDREN cross each day. Why did Biden end the on the spot DNA kit testing for children/parents in order to prove relations of children to those bringing them to the border illegally? Why are children coming across the border unaccompanied with addresses of traffickers written on their flesh with phone numbers for BP to call? Why does BP then send these children across the country to these addresses with zero verification as to the relation between the person and the child? Why is the United Nations funding the migrant caravans? What are N.G,O.'s? One grown man will pick up multiple children of differing ages from an airport with no backround, no verification, nothing, just handing over children to unknown people ever single day in the nation that is the number 1 consumer of child porn on Earth. 

Why did FBI whistleblowers testify that Biden was diverting resources from child trafficking to spying on churches and members of a opposing political party? What is the most profitable black market money maker on Earth currently (it's not drugs...).

Why was Hillary Clinton's foundation investigated for crimes against children in Haiti? Why did the wife of the president of Haiti assassinate him in 2021 and try to take over the country and is only just now being charged? What is the Clinton's relation to Epstien? How far away is Epstien's island from Haiti? What fake Baptist groups were caught taking children from Haiti?

Why would John and Tony Podesta; the 2 biggest Democrat powerhouse politicos of the 21st century and Clinton loyalists (John is currently Biden's climate Czar or something) order 3 children all under the age of 15 as ""entertainment"" for a adult party and that they'd be ""waiting in the hot tub"" in emails? What grown men require children not related to them in a hottub at a adult party as ""entertainment""? Why does Hillary Clinton say in an email: 

""With fingers crossed, the old rabbit's foot out of the box in the attic, I will be sacrificing a chicken in the

backyard to Moloch . . .""

What is the FBI's official release on pedophilia code words? What is the code word for ""Little boy"" primarily one that is a BABY? And what ancient Babylonian god was Moloch and how did child sacrifice play a role in his worship? Who would make a joke about a ancient Babylonian god known for child sacrifice as an adult? As a mother and grandmother who would joke about a evil god that required followers to burn their own children alive as an offering? What was the pantheon of Babylonian gods that this diety belonged to? What is the history of their worship?

What is Baphomet? What are his Similarities to Azazel? Who is Azazel? What did he teach mankind in Enoch? What does the military industrial complex profit from? Why does a American secret society have a ceremony called ""riding the Goat""? Why are altars to him in state capitol buildings? Why is his image all over Europe? Who first worshiped him? What is the role of children in this? What secret society that is every where today and was apart of America's founding that came out of the order that first worshiped this diety? Who are their members today?

Why are there so many archaeology discoveries being made pushing human civilization back further and further? Are we learning we were more advanced at one point or just in a different way? What is being suppressed at all levels of society that was once it's foundation? What are the Nephalim? What happened in the book of Enoch? Why was it kept out of the western Bible? What is ""Gnosis"" and what christian groups were shunned publicly but adopted in secret during the 3rd century AD? How does their ideology play into Luciferianism? What is the difference between Satanism and Luciferianism? What was happening in Enoch that mirrors almost perfectly today from societal changes to developments in technology and space? Why does it matter? Why are they pushing ""interdimensional aliens"" in congress when they've programmed us for decades to believe in flesh and blood little green men? Why is the Pope blaspheming and pushing for a 1 world religion now, of all times? What happened in the past when this occurred and why? What is Babel? Who is Samjaza? What happened to the 3 groups that followed Nimrod after the tower fell? Are they still around? What tf is going on?

What religion is almost universally attacked by Hollywood, western governments, and in the educational system where others are not? Why is a tolerance and love based religion being painted as evil and intolerant by people who claim to believe in nothing?

Why is sexuality and sexual content being pushed to younger and younger children in US schools and online? Why is a man who interviewed convicted pedophiles in prisons and sexually abused children himself that resulted in 1 committing suicide and the other to die of a drug overdose (Kinsey) being used as the foundation to push a ideology that has been proven harmful and even fatal to children in American schools? 

Why did Democrats unanimously vote along party lines to cancel a bill that would put people who purchase children for sex and then carry out that act with the child in prison? Most of the time rn they are let go on bond or bail or probation of some kind. They even said no to just giving them 4yrs.... Unanimously. 

What is a ""Minor Attracted Person"" and who is pushing that? Where do they get their money? Do their money men also give money to a certain political party? 

Why is there this global push by western governments and media to sexualize children? Why are we injecting sex and adult scenarios into the minds of little children who don't even know how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich? Why are we killing our children?",1607673526,1708717043,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As the neon-soaked streets of Night City enveloped me, I realized that Cyberpunk 2077 isn’t just a game; it’s a visceral experience—an intoxicating blend of dystopia, rebellion, and cyber-enhanced chaos. Here’s why it deserves a second look:

-Redemption Arc: Yes, the launch was rocky, plagued by bugs and performance issues. But CD Projekt Red didn’t abandon ship. Instead, they embarked on a relentless journey to polish and refine. The result? A game that now gleams like chrome under city lights.

-Immersive World: Night City breathes. It’s a living, breathing organism—a cacophony of street vendors, fixers, and desperate souls. The graffiti, the holograms, the rain-slicked alleys—they all tell stories. And V, our protagonist, is a cipher through which we explore this cybernetic wonderland.

-Character Depth: The NPCs aren’t mere quest dispensers. They have dreams, fears, and secrets. Judy Alvarez’s melancholic artistry, Johnny Silverhand’s rebellious spirit, and Panam Palmer’s fierce loyalty—they’re etched into my memory.

-Choices Matter: Every decision reverberates. Who you side with, who you romance, how you handle quests—it all shapes your journey. The multiple endings aren’t mere variations; they’re distinct narratives, each leaving an indelible mark.

-Keanu Reeves: Johnny Silverhand isn’t just a celebrity cameo. He’s a digital ghost, a punk rock prophet, and a mirror reflecting V’s inner turmoil. Keanu’s performance elevates the game.

-Soundtrack: The synthwave beats, the haunting melodies—they’re the heartbeat of Night City. Whether cruising in a Quadra or gunning down scavengers, the music amplifies the adrenaline.",1708702290,1708702290,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If a neutral review were possible, I'd rate it so, but as it is, I can't give it a positive Vote. Of course this is purely my subjective view:

The game has a good start, but after the only one emotional gripping moment in the game, which was for me after  [spoiler] the theft of the Relic [/spoiler], it got bland and generic and I had the urge to just stop playing it several times. When finally forcing myself to finishing after 140 hours I was just glad it was over and I couldn't care about what happened to the main character and his friends.

I waited with my purchase for after the release of Phantom Liberty and was pretty grumpy to find it still as riddled with bugs as it is. None of them gamebreaking, but still a slap in the customers face after all the time given to get rid of them.

This is clearly no longer the studio, that created ""the witcher 3"". Not by a long, long way. The ""Corpos"" obviously just draining the impressive work done once upon a time.

+ Many many hours of gameplay
+ Very customiseable skilltrees
+ Graphics
+ Fighting system

- Many many hours of emotionally uninvested getting rid of one quest after another.
- Bugs Bugs Bugs (still!!!)
- The Moments that obviously should trigger emotional player responses feel like done according to a mathematical formula. (I mean, I don't  expect something so impressively stunning as Iris van Everecs ""I am sadness"" moments. But this game doesn't even get anywhere close to the storytelling and questwriting of those days. When for example,  [spoiler] So Mi reminisces/has backflashes about her past in the last Phantom liberty quest [/spoiler] I was just plain bored and couldn't care less.

Conclusion: Its a graphic- and gametime-wise big game, but had I not bought it at the 50% discount, I would have felt severely ripped off. It's ok, but in it's intention to become grand, it just got generic.
Worth the half price, but (for me) definitely not anywhere close to a milestone in game-history, that some reviewers seem to see in it.",1708692481,1708692481,False,1,0,0.486885249614715576,0,True,False,False

Bugs aside, I thought the story was pretty boring, mostly due to the poor writing of almost every supporting character. I found most of the game’s personality limited to the hit or miss optional content, where you’re either destined to strike gold or just gun down some random group of enemies that got thrown in to pad for time; no incentive provided other than a few eddies and maybe progress towards an achievement, sometimes with as little explanation as ""these are criminals"". It plays much the same as the original Deus Ex, only with an open world, driving mechanics, and decades of improvements in graphical fidelity, but are those few features really worth paying modern AAA prices for what is essentially a 20 year old game? Not in my opinion.

So why did I buy this game again? Well, there were a couple of reasons, the first of which is cross-progression. The implementation of cross-progression in the 1.6 patch meant that I could pick up where I left off without having to play through the entire game again. The second reason is mods. The restoration of cut content and addition of many much needed features (Such as flying cars and apartment customisation) have given the game far more longevity in my opinion. The last reason was the Edgerunners anime. It was an amazing marketing strategy which I clearly fell for.

Sadly, mods weren’t enough to salvage the experience. The game simply has nothing to offer after 100% completion; No radiant quests, no random encounters, no minigames, no mission replay, no new game plus. Hell, you can barely interact with the NPCs at any of the twelve bars the game has to offer, and that's not even counting the ones missing map markers. I know that this is a complaint a lot of fans take issue with, but the only counter-argument I've seen is ""Replay the game with a different build"". As I said in my opening paragraph, the 110 hours I've already sunk into the game made for a lacklustre experience, so why would I want to do it all again? Maybe if there was NG+, that would be a viable option... but there isn't. Most of my enjoyment came from just flying around Night City using the aformentioned mod, and so I think wanting some kind of sandbox content from the developers themselves is more than justified. Hopefully the upcoming DLC or even sequel is redemption enough, but at this point, I’m not confident.",1665537249,1708657415,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I was not affected by the hype and saw the game for what it was. I also got the game a year after release. I have since run through the game twice. It is a fun and immersive game.

For me, there are aspects of the combat that I never used, hacking and crafting being the less used. This is a looter shooter with a story mode.

Covid had just hit full force and I'd just been laid off as a result, and I once accidentally played this game for over 24 hours straight.  I remember my roommate getting up, leaving for work, getting back from his shift, hanging out for a while, going to bed, and then getting up for his next shift again while I played a merc in Night City and took bathroom and food breaks every ninety minutes when it crashed.  Sure I was basically playing an alpha release, but an alpha of a game that absolutely rules.  

I'm probably working through my fourth or fifth playthrough right now and I haven't gotten bored.  This is the game that caused my carpal tunnel.  Even now I still drive faster than the game can load and fall through the map sometimes, it's really a late beta with the promise of a final release to come alongside the upcoming phantom liberty expansion.  I still haven't decided if I'll use one of my existing files or start a whole new one when it comes out, I wouldn't mind an excuse to play through the game again.  This game rules.

The story is incredibly written, all of the characters are distinct and awesome in their own ways, the dramatic moments are intense, exciting, and emotional, the jokes are funny, Keanu Reeves' character is always inserting his highly entertaining input into every situation and putting his whole (Lord forgive me for this) Keanussy into his performance.  Narratively this game is a 10/10.

The gameplay is incredibly fun, and in my opinion the current skill trees are actually a ton of fun to create a build out of.  I was initially underwhelmed by the small buff nature of a lot of the buyable skills, but since then the min maxer in me has come to really love the skill tree as it is, to the point I'm scared they'll change it too much with this upcoming expansion.  (I'm sure they'll just improve it though, these guys clearly know what they're doing).  Like I said earlier, I'm on my fourth or fifth playthrough right now, and every playthrough I've built characters builds that have been entirely different from each other, have played incredibly different in combat and even in social situations, and have all been incredibly fun mechanically in ways that are entirely different from each other.  The small buffs you buy with skill points are underwhelming at first, but grow into incredibly powerful builds that encourage you to play in ways that are diverse and engaging.  I keep trying new wacky builds and they keep being super fun.  It's honestly a little baffling to me.  Almost all of them turn combat into a puzzle, some where you have to be slow and methodical, and others where you have to be fast and precise.  I initially found the stealth mechanics underwhelming as well, but now I love them.  I feel they do a good job emulating the cyberpunk genre, where almost every job starts carefully and precisely and then by the end of it everything's gone to shit and you're just trying to make it out alive.  

I know I've already described two things as initially underwhelming, and that's too many things for this review to be trustworthy when I still claim that this game rules, but this game rules.  I swear.  Cross my heart.  There are many fantastic gameplay systems at work within this game, and all the rustier ones are getting updated with this new patch.  I love the way cyberwear is implemented, the various avenues through which you can improve your abilities and the insane ways you can combine them, the way every combat either makes you feel like a scrappy underdog, a superhero, or a god, the different dialogue options you're given that seem to cover every type of character you could want to play and do so effectively, and even the voice acting that at least never fails to take swings.  This is basically the perfect game.  It actually drives me crazy that this is the game that flares my carpal tunnel more than anything else because it's the one that caused it.  I can only play it like once or twice a week now, and I have to take frequent stretch breaks.  Infuriating.  

TLDR I love this game and my judgement is clearly clouded, but I'll shout its praises to anyone that will listen like a sweetly delusional missionary",1688910545,1708654628,True,3,0,0.541984736919403076,0,True,False,False

I picked it up way after launch and at a steep discount. But as of the time of this review, after 120 hours put into this game, I can spout on and on about how good this game is. I can prattle on for hours about how immersive the world is, how some of the characters are written so well that you actually care about what happens to them in the world, how well the combat can be tailored to any player's preference, or how pretty the game looks on ultra settings with high-fidelity and amazing lighting engines. I can gush about the sheer amount of talent and genuine passion that leaks out of this game by a team that got dragged over coals for almost 2 years by releasing a literally unplayable mess, but stuck to their guns, fixed it, and didn't give up on it after 3 years.

But I won't do any of that. I don't want to type a thesis and I'm sure you don't want to read one.

""WELCOME TO NIGHT CITY FOLKS!""

I've decided to edit my original review of this game that I made before the 2.0 patch was released and I know there has been more since but I think it's time I gave a truly fair opinion.

I genuinely love this game. After my first play-through, just gun ho-ing everything from start to finish and uninstalling and moving on to the next game I decided the new play-through was worthwhile to try out the mod options you can do (enhancements, not game mods) and on my mother's grave it was the best decision I ever made. I even came back a third time and did only throwing weapons for the entirety of the campaign and that was hands down some of the most fun I have had in a game in years. 

Phantom Liberty added a great additional storyline to the original script and with it comes some great weapons, characters and missions to make this game even better. After putting 325 hours into the game so far I now find myself downloading it again for the 4th time because I genuinely miss the fun I had. 

cyberpunk 2077 opened a hole in my heart and nothing has ever been able to come close to filling that empty void no matter how hard I've looked.

So, I've been diving deep into the neon-lit streets of Night City with Cyberpunk 2077 on PC, and let me just say, it's been an absolute blast. The story grabbed me from the get-go, pulling me into a gritty, dystopian world where every choice feels like it carries weight, shaping the narrative in ways both big and small. It's this kind of storytelling depth that makes you feel truly immersed, like you're not just playing a character, but living their life.

The game mechanics are a standout feature, seamlessly blending RPG elements with fast-paced action. Whether it's hacking into an enemy's cyberware, trading bullets in a high-octane shootout, or just cruising around Night City, every moment in-game feels thrilling and engaging. The level of detail CD Projekt Red has put into making this world feel alive is nothing short of astonishing.

Now, let's talk mods. The modding community for Cyberpunk 2077 is vibrant, to say the least. Being able to tweak the game to my liking, adding everything from visual enhancements to entirely new gameplay features, has significantly extended my enjoyment and investment in the game. It's like getting a new game every time I try out a different set of mods, which is a dream for any tech enthusiast and gamer.

In conclusion, Cyberpunk 2077 is a must-play for anyone who's a fan of deep stories, engaging mechanics, and the freedom to mod. Despite its rocky start, the patches and updates have transformed it into a title I highly recommend. Whether you're in it for the narrative, the action, or the sheer joy of customizing your experience, Cyberpunk 2077 delivers on all fronts. Definitely a game I'm glad to have in my collection.",1708641737,1708641737,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

 Originally I played on the cloud back when it launched and I was shocked by how the game manages to tell a story that could seamlessly be the plot to an action movie. Even with all the bugs it wasn't game breaking and it was a nice escape from reality winter 2020.  Then time passes, things got better and eventually the cloud service went under. They were cool though so I got a refund and then purchased this game on console to continue my adventures as V. After a 1.5 year break that itch for Cyberpunk was calling again and I decided to treat myself to CP2077 on PC. YES THIS GAME IS GOOD I LITERALLY BROUGHT IT 3 SEPARATE TIMES .

Driving around Night City on my bike feels great, and I haven't used fast travel more than a couple of times during my entire playthrough - in stark contrast to Witcher 3 where travelling was so tedious I went out of my way to install a mod to allow fast travel from anywhere.

I've only ever played patch 2.11, so I don't know what state the game was in before that, but apart from three crashes during a 50-hour playthrough, I haven't encountered any game-stopping bugs. But I've encountered a few amusing ones: once my bike caught fire somehow and kept burning for several in-game hours before it exploded; I saw a homeless person hanging around and chilling out though he'd caught fire from standing too close to a campfire; I saw a traffic accident where one car t-boned another car and was launched about 20 metres into the air, flying above an overpass, and exploding when it hit the ground; that sort of funny little things... 

However, the game has one significant flaw: Johnny Silverhand, the GM's edgelord Gary Stu who's more central to the plot than you are, and who is an obnoxious, abusive douchebag without any redeeming features throughout the game - except at the very end where he for some inexplicable reason does a near-complete turnaround and becomes only extremely irritating for his final scene. I guess the devs thought that ""hey, he looks like Keanu Reeves and is voiced by him, so everyone likes him (or will not at least actively hate him)"", but not quite - he's not even an antihero, he's just an utter twat. Having finished one playthough, I'm seriously contemplating whether to ever start another one, because I absolutely loathe the character - which is a shame, because otherwise, the game has quite a lot to offer.

So, I'm recommending this with the caveat that if you can't ignore an obnoxious asshat character that butts into your game and ruins the flow of it from time to time, don't buy. On the other hand, if you have a high tolerance threshold for that, the other parts do mostly make up for it.",1708632128,1708632225,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There's SO much to do - if you want to do it, that is. There are storyline missions, but you can just ignore them and go for a wander if you want. I do that sometimes, just to take in the stunning scenery. Honestly, the level design, the graphics, and ambience, it's all superb. I often just load up Cyberpunk so I can take a stroll around Night City and admire just how beautiful it is.

Of course, I do the odd mission when the mood takes me! The battles and gunplay are great fun, especially when you start upgrading to automatic weapons. Even taking a walk down the wrong alley at the wrong time can end up in a glorious gunfight - with lots of goodies to collect afterwards.

(edit)
I said this 4 years ago when the game came out, I have not changed it at all. After 4 years, I still come back to this game. The city, the people, the characters, the romantic partners (mainly Panam), the combat system, the loot, THE HUGE LORE. This game has been polished more that any shoe out there. I find myself on my second preview just to relive the story. No game has ever sent me down so much of an emotional roller-coaster as this one. I couldn't stop thinking about it for weeks. Somehow the game is as beautiful as i remember, from the night lights, the ads, the detail, to even the sand dunes on the outskirts. Its a stunning view everywhere you go. Without spoiling anything, the endings make or break your emotional stability. And as i said, the characters! They are the highlight for me, you can really tell how much work the devs put into them. I think they might even be real. The combat is flawless now, gunplay is fun, the melee is good (mainly the dismemberment system), the hacking is a thrill. I wish i could find flaws in this game like you could at launch. I strongly recommend this game. It changed gaming for me, almost as much as it changed me back in 2020. My favourite game of all time. If you want a happy game, this isnt really that, just as Johnny Silverhand said, ""Wrong city, wrong people"".

This game, especially the storylines with Panam, Judy and Rogue, actually give some really healthy relationship options! SImilar to the Witcher 3. The only thing I would change about the storyline is to make the ending with Panam more tragic. I think that woulda made the characters more memorable. 

The gameplay is fantastic - several wildly different styles you can use to deal with enemies. Among the ones I've tried, the most fun were: cyberpsycho all-out melee with sword or blunt weapon and invisible assassin with rogue's pistol, silenced. Netrunner and assault specialists are also fun for a while.",1708620732,1708620732,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Maybe Cyberpunk 2077 had a shaky start, but as of this version and all the revisions, with the expansion, this game is an absolute masterpiece.

I've loved the Cyberpunk 2020 setting for three decades, Transmetropolitan is one of the best graphic novels ever and I've watched Fight Club more times than I can count. I didn't expect to see all of them reflected in the game. I still didn't expect I'd love Cyberpunk 2077 this much, but it totally got me.

These days, basing a massive game (with a major budget) on 30+ years of old RPG lore just doesn't happen. I was falsely under the impression that 2077 would be a soft reboot, since the attitude of ""this much backstory could be a burden in attracting new players, so let's just scrap the old lore"" is so common these days. (Fuck you, James Workshop.) I was pleasantly surprised when I realized that pretty much all of the stuff from Cyberpunk 2020 is still canon and even a major part of this game's main story.

If you want maximum appreciation of the setting, in the Steam version's bonus content you can find a complete scan of the Cyberpunk 2020 original rulebook. While most of this time capsule will make you appreciate the details of 2077 worldbuilding, I'd recommend at least reading the short story/adventure ""Never Fade Away"", originally published in 1988.

The last time I got this emotionally invested and immersed with a game's story and characters was probably back with Mass Effect 2. The Witcher 3 got close, but I like Cyberpunk 2077 even more. The saying ""In Cyberpunk, there are no happy endings"" is quite true. Half of the possible endings had me in bittersweet tears and the rest were so cripplingly depressing they should come with a medical warning. As it should be. Case never saw Molly again.

One other thing about this game that I don't think has been emphasized enough is the music. It's also something that nobody's dared to do. Instead of licensing famous old 80s/90s hits for nostalgic emotions (like pretty much any movie trailer these days), the music in this game is original. There's something closer to 15 hours of new music and radio stations in this game and it's performed by actual artists working under Cyberpunk pseudonyms, with the titles and lyrics in-universe. Hell, they've even recreated some of the bands and tracks referred to in the old RPG books. While this is already quite insane, the soundtrack just bangs with really diverse genres represented, from black metal to obnoxiously cute lazrpop. I don't think anyone has ever done musical justice to a fictional setting this well. 

This would be worth the price just so you can ride your motorcycle around the massive, detailed city (or ride the metro, I guess) while listening to the radio stations and soaking in the ambience of Night City.

This game is one massive love letter to one old cult RPG and it's so weird that it isn't actually made by greedy corpocunt suits who just want to chase profits. Work of art, really. Thank you, CD Projekt and Mike Pondsmith.",1708613273,1708613613,True,3,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

They spent this much time making the game somewhat playable and somewhat similar to what they had promised us back then, when the game was being released.

The reasoning behind this is that they don't really know what they're doing with their game, I can tell (and we all can tell if u're honest with urselves)
We can see that in new features: they all originate (at least in some way) from Edgerunners anime.
And this is kinda funny, cause I think, we should expect something more than new skill tree with Martinez abilities and all that.
That doesn't mean that those changes are bad, that only means that they(devs) don't have ane new creative ideas.
And It makes sense, cause it's really hard to make something work well in this setting without breaking balance or something.
And all the new problems that pop-up with ua local and trying devs to still sell the games to russians when they don't even know what they want from the game of from devs, it makes me giggle ngl.

Can't do anything from the cybershard in your inventory. It's in a menu you can't directly go to, and that you can only* go to by manually backing out of a different menu, but even then, the option isn't visible until you hover over an unrelated tab). The GUI/HUD of your game shouldn't be a Myst level obscure puzzle. It was so bad, I almost refunded a game I was super excited to play. It took a good 15 hours before I wasn't stopping every 10 minutes to look up how to perform some basic task on Reddit. Also, now I can't stop listening to gangster reggaeton and it's driving everyone nuts.

Okay, that said, I really enjoy the game, and how much variety there is in how you can play it. Wanna go full GTA with nothing but car chases and bewbies and doin' crimes? You can do that. Want to make thorny ethical decisions and try to fix society? You can do that, too. I don't like the driving mechanic, so I seriously just run everywhere (and fast travel). There's so much gorgeous detail (even though I have all the graphics settings on ""potato"" because my computer's a few years old), every neighborhood has a distinct feel and population and visual style.

[B]Apart from these things, the game is very good. I'm not going to wait for an update to fix all this, so I'm playing the game as it is and even with these things, I'm having fun. The story is very good. The current lack of optimization makes the game feel like you're playing on an old generation console (PS3, XBOX 360) where games ran at 30 FPS. Because it's not optimized, the game has this FPS range, from 30 to 45 FPS. I believe that once they release future updates, this will be resolved and the game will be even more fantastic. It's not unplayable like the console versions, which will practically need a patch the size of a new cyberpunk to improve. You can play the game, but there's also that, right? You have to make sure you don't find it a problem to play at 30 FPS. Well, that's all I have to say, I'll keep playing the game![/B]

The game is 99.9% bug free, the graphics are the best I've ever seen, and the city is not only huge, but also a work of art.  Every district has a different feel to it, but the transitions between districts are natural.  One play through with side quests is over 100 hours.   I didn't bother with spoilers, just played how I felt, and the game was fine.  It's a dark game, kind of depressing, but I expected that.  By the end of the stories, I'm maxed out on everything and just kind of ready to wrap up the last few bits.

It's one of those games that I could probably let sit for a year and then come back and play it a different way.

Minor negatives include that there's not much point in gaining new cars or apartments... they're cool, but that's it.  Relationships are limited.  There's no base building aspect or car improving aspect or anything like that, and at some point your customization of your character will be maxed.  And racing is done on rubber bands... if you get too far behind, they'll wait for you a bit, if you get too far ahead, they'll magically keep up...  so every race comes down to whether they pass you in the final stretch, no matter what you do.

But these are minor complaints given how 'full' the world is, how deep the story is, and how amazing everything looks and feels.  By the time I'm done with the game I'll have paid about 50 cents an hour for my entertainment... considering inflation now, you can't get a quarter tank of gasoline or even a small drink or slider for that.

Done for good. CDPR can eat $hit.

Update: Nov 26, 2022...Loved the edgerunners show! I like how they worked in some easter eggs from the show into the game. Very fun. 100%ed it and will definitely play the expansion when it comes out.

Update: March 5, 2022...Alright, reinstalled after this latest update to check it out. I still don't like the driving but that's just me maybe. You are either speeding fast or crawling, no in-between. However, I am now changing my review to a thumbs up. It is quite fun now.

Update: Nov 24, 2021...Still haven't been back to playing. I guess the bugs just had me to the point that I know if I go back to the game, I will have to start the story all over again; and there just isn't enough immersion for me to put myself through all the same missions again. I missed a lot by playing though the first few weeks of release and yeah...sticking this in my ""don't play again"" folder. RIP

Original review below but let me update this...
The people who actually worked on this game did an amazing job with the time they were given. The managers/producers are the ones that gave us all the finger with what they released. 

Teased 8 years ago, but I only found out today that they just started PRE-production in 2016 which means they did this in 3 - 4 years.

Story writing, voice acting, graphics (on high end machine), world creation: Top notch
Being able to live in that world...not great at the moment but I hope with a few months work will get better.


----Original Review----
Lie...I get why they had to hype it up, they spent so many years making it and it feels like a game that could have been released a couple years ago.

Cool story and I love the idea of it but it could be sooooo much better. 

I've had the same cop outside my building taking a statement from the same guy for many days. I died and came back to life (story) and they are still there. I pulled my gun out and aimed it on a sidewalk in front of my building and a guy next to me got scared and crouched down with his hands over his head; he is still there in the same position after days and days in game. multiple cut scenes with invisible props that the characters interact with. Car driving mechanics, wow, just horrible. At 30 mph your vehicle turns like you are doing 100mph, start turning at the light and you are going to hit the sidewalk on the other side. There are just a lot of immersion breaking issues.

I will keep playing and finish the story but man, it could have been way better.

Knowing what I know now, if you haven't bought this yet then wait a few months and watch the updates/patches they release. If they are working hard on it, I would assume it will be great in 3 to 6 months.",1607777630,1708572492,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The update improves the game in almost every aspect except for the in game driving which is still guff.  It fixes many of the issues that plagued all previous versions and adds new features that enhance the experience. 

Night City feels more alive and immersive. The new police system adds challenge and excitement, as you have to deal with more realistic chases and roadblocks. The combat AI is smarter and more responsive. The UI has been overhauled making it more user-friendly and intuitive. The loot, items, and crafting have been improved meaning the stuff you pick up actually helps you progress in the game rather than just collecting a load of junk.  You can also interact with NPCs more and order food from street vendors. 

Cyberpunk 2077 2.0 is definitely worth your time, especially on it's current sale.

[b]Map[/b] - Probably one of the best cities I have ever been in. It doesnt feel like some boring ass grid-system city design. There is verticality, imperfect road designs, and it just feels NATURAL. 

[b]Graphics[/b] - This game looks fucking beautiful. I am playing with full RTX and this game just looks great.

[b]Gunplay[/b] - If you compare gunplay to destiny then this game will lose. However, it is more than good enough and is executed fine. It won't blow your hat off but it is FAR from bad. (note: the sens right now just feels off. Like there is mouth smoothing. I can't quite figure it out but its just a little off)

[b]Atmosphere[/b] - Idk how to put this in words but the city and the areas surrounding have distinct ""vibes"". You can tell when you are in a rougher part of town and when you are in luxury. It feels alive when its suppose to and ""dead"" when its suppose to.

[b]Music[/b] Amazing. Radio stations are great and the base soundtrack fits the scenes perfectly. Props for the OST

[b]Side Quests[/b] As you would expect, side quests are amazing. Some of them feel like their own main stories.  I highly recommend you complete them and tbh if you purposely choose not too, then you are missing out.

[b]Story[/b] - So far the story has been what I expected. I did not expect some deep level thinking and a story about what it means to be human. I was expecting a story where you just ""experience"" the city and the characters take you on a journey.

[b]Characters[/b] - All perfectly voice acted (the ones I have ENCOUNTERED). I can't think of an AVA (bl3) in this game so far. Theres no character I wish wasn't in the game.

[b]Main Character[/b] - (MALE V) I never expected me to deeply care about V and how HE's feeling. I am more playing it like I am the character playing through a vessel. If that makes any sense. Don't hate me but I just couldn't give a shit about geralt for the first half of witcher 3 so this could be like that but I have to yet to care about V like characters from other games. Thats OK to me, it hasn't taken the experience down for me.

[b]Johnny Silverhand[/b] - Skillup claimed the keanu was a miscast. His reasoning was we love Keanu because he is a wholesome guy. However, Johnny is an asshole badass character. I disagree with this claim that Keanu was a miscast. seriously don't care how an actor is in real life compared to a character they ACT as. I have loved every interaction with Johnny and I love listening to the comments he makes towards your choices.

[b]Driving/Cars[/b] - Really sucks there is no car customization AT all. It got scrapped during development. I do sincerely hope they add it in a DLC down the road. However, the cars in this game just all look sick and unique. I don't think most of them feel ""out there"". 

Driving feels ""ok"" with MnK. I have used controller and it feels much better after tweaking with controller options. However, I don't think its as bad as the raging twitter/reddit people would want to tell you. It's ""fine"". Its perfect it could use slight tweaks.

My biggest gripe with ""driving"" is how ZOOMED in the minimap is when driving. You are flying 100mph and then you gotta slam your brakes and make a sharp turn because there is no way you knew you had to take that exit. Then you end up drifting and killing 3 small children and you feel like shit ;-;/

[b]Performance and Optimization[/b] - With my setup (specs below) I get around 60-90fps (unless I am in the dense and high population areas.) I run the game at mostly high settings and RTX on with DLSS-Q. 

This game needs some love on the optimization side. I don't know how much more CDPR can do to fix it but there has to be something. However, I do think we will just need to wait for more advances with hardware until we can get 100+ fps with RTX.

[b]RPG Elements[/b] Will update what I think of skills when I beat the game.

Kinda sucks secondary stats have such little effect when all that really seems to matter is DPS. Would like more detail and work done to weapon stats. For example, why do the sights in this game have -0.05% reduced ADS speed. You wouldn't even notice that.

Transmog systems people. Its 2020 and this SHOULD have been in the game at launch. I can't make my character not look fucking stupid.

[b]Romance[/b] - Pretty fucking big let down. You only get one person you can romance per gender and sexuality. For example as a Male V (straight) I can ONLY romance panam. There is no choice or anything... that is it. I have heard that the Male V (gay) option is downright horrible, but youll have to see for yourself or research.

Not many choice with escorts (if you care). Very slight differences in each sex scene.

Panam is waifu <3

**NOTE**: There is a character you meet early game that you can have a ""moment"" with. Don't want to spoil it but you can look it up if you want.

[b]Bugs[/b] - Oh boy where to begin...

- constant graphical bugs and light flickering during certain moments.
- bug where when I enter the vehicle I am floating 5 ft above?
- floating cars
- cars flying 1000 ft in the air for no reason
- characters t-posing
- charcters just straight up twitching
- Cars driving all over the place (cars will randomly fucking swerve to the side of the lane or cross it and if you are on a bike good luck)
- during ""cutscenes"" and riding with other characters in vehicles. The car will not feel like its on the ground and they never follow a consistent path. You will just feel like you are sliding on ice or just straight up teleporting.
- Randomly switching from night to day or from raining to sunny.

TLDR: Mostly visual bugs and immersion breakers. I have only crashed once and I think it was actually windows with how it happened. To the people that are crashing just update your drivers and make sure you are not overclocking as much. I had to turn down my gpu core clock when playing cyberpunk. Ran just fine with other games until CB2077.


theres a shit ton more but heres all I have time to type up.

Who would I recommend them this game too? Well there are Categories

""I waited 8 years for this game and fuck everything else"": Buy it now
""I have outstanding hardware and can handle the bugs"": Buy it now

""I would rather wait until things are patched up but not too long"": Check at Christmas and if it isn't there yet wait till February
""I would rather wait until the game is patched and there are 0 bugs"": Wait till next spring or longer

""I am not sure I have the hardware to run this game"":  Check benchmarks over the next few days and if you can't get at least 60 then you will prob just have to upgrade your pc. Doubt patches will have substantial impact on fps in the long run



As of November:
Really sad to see that more content has been delayed. The game definitely would have benefited from another 1 to 2 years delay. Despite all the bugs and missing features that seem standard, there was still a lot to enjoy. The side quests, main story, and the dialogue is what I really enjoyed. I am a sucker for the cyberpunk genre. 

I still have yet to crash in this game or have any game breaking bugs. Again, at least 1 extra year would have done so much for this game.

Edit: Feb 2024, After phantom liberty which is the one and only DLC for the game, I can say this game has been one of the best I have ever played.

This game has a good story, strong characters and the best facial expressions I have ever encountered in any video game. A fully rendered neon lit city without invisible walls. On top of that the graphics, the setting and the vibes are all great. Sounds good no? No. The game play is the problem.

I play with a controller and I play on the hardest difficulty. Game play is stiff with many basic movements locked behind perks from the skill tree associated with reflexes. This gives a poor first impression. To add guns handle poorly, the only firearms I actually enjoy using are double barrel shotguns and large revolvers. Cars handle poorly which extends to vehicle combat. It is repetitive. Overall I've come to the conclusion that for me, the game simply isn't fun to play.

So far on PC I haven't encountered any apart from the usual minor glitches you get with most games of this size and scope, objects hovering in the mid air occasionally or NPCs glitching out etc.

This is up there with some of the best games I've ever played. The story is well made, the voice acting is amazing, the scripts are all very well written, the world is highly detailed and large enough to feel like a true open world. There's also a ton of side missions to do along with the main story as well as lot of lore to collect and read if you enjoy that kind of thing. The combat feels great too.

Overall it now feels like an extremely polished experience, at least on PC and as soon as I've finished the main game I will be instanly buying Phantom Liberty.

The only one thing I would love to see in a game like this in the future is AI interaction wth NPCS like demoed in the Matrix Unreal demo. Being able to interect with the city inhabants would make it feel more alive as currrenty almost every filler NPC just says the same few selected comments when you speak to them which kind of defies the point of even being able to talk to them in the first place.

I found that this game's themes and environments were too persistently uncomfortable and hit too close to home while the open-world genre feels too dried up by now to instill any sense of incentive or motivation to commit. Very grimy vibes overall. Impressive graphical fidelity, though, and the esoteric, religious/spiritual/philosophical/existential themes and references were very on point.

I could go for a walk through nature, maybe plant some trees and flowers, maybe boycott everything and never play video games again, perhaps start shaving coins and defacing currency, etc. etc. etc.

I am a day one player, I was there during the disastrous launch of this game. I can say without hesitation that my first experience was a roller-coaster of bugs, crashes, and frustration, especially playing on a PS4! It was a mess. However, there was something about this game that kept me hooked.

Despite the flaws, this game managed to captivate me in a way few games ever have. It became the first game I ever platinumed, something  that I never achieved with other games, and I beat the game not once, but twice! I am a sucker for a good narrative, and Cyberpunk 2077 kept me playing because of its storytelling and characters and its fascinating world.

Fast forward to 2024, I am revisiting the game again (for the DLC), starting my third playthrough, this time on PC. With the recent updates, the transformation is remarkable. The world feels more alive, the improvements evident in every corner. Quality of life updates have polished the experience, making it smoother and more enjoyable than ever.

To those still on the fence about diving into Cyberpunk 2077, now is the time. The game has evolved from its troubled beginnings into something truly special. The narrative depth, the immersive world, and the unforgettable characters make it an experience worth having. Despite its rocky start, Cyberpunk 2077 has secured its place as my all-time favorite game!",1708515705,1708515853,True,5,0,0.581749081611633301,0,True,False,False

Short answer? ∞/10.  It has officially overtaken RDR2 as my favourite game.
Long answer?
Broooo, you've gotta play this game. This was actually my second playthrough since I bought it on steam after the 2.0 update. I had a great time during my first playthrough but I did not enjoy it as much as I did now, not sure why that was the case.
The story? ABSOLUTE FREAKIN BANGER.
Characters? Man I spent hours talking to them and hanging out with them. They feel real and I wanna hangout with them IRL.
Graphics? Literally next freakin gen, every single place looks beautiful. I probably spammed a bunch of SS as well. I literally spent hours just roaming around and chilling taking in the view, that's how stunningly beautiful the world is.

The game has insane replayability with all it's various gameplay mechanics. Want a stealth build where you drop in with your throwing knives and take them out one by one? Or want to run a david martinez setup? Or how about a high level netrunner hacking everyone in seconds? Sooo many fun aspects in the game to check out and try new things. I love that. I love that so much.

I mean I sat and finished side gigs, side missions and played through every main character's story arc cause of how fun and unique all of it was. Especially the missions that play with your morality scale. ""The lesser evil"", cannot be put better in perspective than some of these side missions. I don't want to spoil anything for you, but please, please do yourself a favour and try not to just play the main story. Explore the world and do side quests, you will not regret them.

That being said, there is a massive issue to all of this. Once you finish playing the game, you feel empty af. Like you've lost a friend, it's way too immersive that it took me a while to get used to other games. 
Honestly, if this game released in it's current state back when they officially announced it, people would have gone crazy over how awesome it is. Kinda sad that it did not reach it's potential glory and become a legend due to corporate XD.

The game play is OK, and it certainly has SOME entertainment value.  I took the time to 100% it afterall.  Well let me go over some of the pros and cons.

**edit**  Bonus negative points for adding a payed DLC that included more achievements.  I 100%ed it before phantom liberty came out.

CONS

The difficulty curve is not very well laid out.  I played the game on hardest difficulty and found that the beginning was too hard and the end was too easy.  I had to play the beginning almost entirely through stealth and sneaking up on people, but by the end I could just storm through everything.  And when I say the end, I mean pretty early on.  In fact, most of the quests in the game begin to feel very quickly monotonous and a lot more like a chore than a challenge.  And I could have gone about doing it in multiple ways, whether I wanted to do it through hacking or slashing, pun intended.

And this leads to a second con...  The level cap is stupid.  Why design the game so that you can't get everything.  I understand why you can't respec as it would open up too much cheese, but preventing people from experiencing all the possibilities in one play-through is dumb.  Especially considering how repetitive the game becomes.

A third con, the story ending all kind of just plain suck in my opinion.  Like, there really is no happy ending.  There are just some that are less bad.  This, to me, just feels really not good.  If I am going to invest so much time and effort into a story and working for something, for it to end in such a shitty way kind of feels like the whole thing was just a waste of effort.  ""Congratulation, you get a month of kind of happiness before you die"" as the best ending is just crap.  Seriously, F that.

So when talking about story telling flaws, I have to touch on some personal pet peeves of mine.  The fact that I cannot romance the girl as a guy is just dumb.  Hear me out here.  This is a fantasy game.  A game people play to experience a fantastic or phantasmal reality.  Please, someone explain to me why anyone should be blocked the option to experience what they want to in the fantasy game.  girl on girl, guy on guy, girl on guy... why not just let them all be options?  To purposefully block a relationship option is doing nothing but pandering to the people who like that particular relationship option and blocking out people who prefer different choices.  If you want to put in gay background NPC's, sure... who cares.  Especially in this wold where people can change genitalia and reproductive systems with the sit of a chair.  like true gender swapping, not the lies that exist in the world today.  You can do that kind of stuff in a fantasy game.  So honestly, having a gay romancable NPC that limits her sexuality is actually anti woke really, as she won't even accept a gender swap as ok, because of what?  You voice hasn't changed?  The whole thing is just dumb.  In an attempt to cater to the woke mob, none of it makes sense.  And speaking of over-woke bs that annoys me, how does a ""trans"" character even make sense in this world.  I understand that trans issues are all over the place in our reality, but what the fuck??  This is a world where people are swapping their genders all the fucking time.  Sit in a chair for 5 minutes and get new organs.  How the fuck do trans issues even come up.  It's a FANTASY GAME.  Don't project this worlds issues into it.  Like, if it's not obvious by now, I am super anti-woke... but it's a fantasy game.  LET THE TRANS PEOPLE HAVE A WORLD WHERE THEY CAN GENDER SWAP AT WILL AND IT""S NOT A BIG CONTROVERSY???  Why project all the drama of our world into the game???  Just let people play out a fantasy.  

Honestly, who fucking goes, ""I want to play a fantasy game.  In that game, I want to be bullied, harassed, and have no love partners that I like return interest in me.  Oh also, I really want the ending for the character I am role-playing as to be super shitty""  There is no grand satisfying payoff, at least story-wise, and we have this worlds drama shoved in our face.  It's unnecessary, and takes away from the goals of playing a fantasy game.

Also, all of the cars are dumb.  SO many cars, so much money, all very similar.  Buying new cars, apartments, in general was just a chore that felt overall very dissatisfying.



PROS

-Interesting skill tree... which is part of why it is so annoying that there are so many limitations on it.

-The game, at the times when the challenge level was OK, was fun.  Unfortunately most of the time it was too hard or too easy.

-It's pretty, if not a little repetitive at times



Anyway, I feel a little bad leaving a negative review since the company worked so hard to make-up for all of the games other problems it had at launch (bugs and such).  But honestly, overall, if given the chance to wipe my gameplay completely from my mind and know what I know now (like seeing this review) , I would have never played it.

This game is still a buggy mess and you will crash at least a few times/encounter game breaking bugs/Immersion breaking bugs many times in your play-throughs. Another issue I have is the 2.0 and onward updates broke nearly all mods made so far and there are ALOT that still haven't been updated.

However, this game is in a SIGNIFICANTLY better space compared to when it came out back in 2020. There are still some glaring and weird issues I have with the story like how little we get to actually interact with Jackie, how hollow the apartments feel, and certain quests feeling inadequate. The story has it's sore spots but kept me fairly engaged throughout, it's gameplay can be unique especially with the different play styles you have to choose from. 

I can finally say, especially with any sale coming up, that this game is entirely worth it. It may not be the greatest thing you have ever played but it can definitely keep you engaged for at least 60 hours at a minimum and get you fairly immured in the world.

Definitely think it is a great game now, especially after the Phantom Liberty update/DLC. Now I don't think its a God-Tier RPG, but it's really close to it. I hope that CDPR learned from their experience with creating this game, and I think that the sequel is going to be one for the record books for a better reason than this game.",1608004830,1708502941,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Edit:  I now have well over 400 hours in this game and have completed the DLC.  All I can say is... I love this game.  The graphics overhaul was needed and appreciated.  Ray tracing and AI graphics was a game changer.  The city is teeming with life and every detail of this game is amazing.  It took a while to adjust to the new skill trees, but I learned it quick and really enjoyed it.  If you haven't played this game yet, then now is the time.  The DLC is amazing, with a fantastic story and heart pounding battles.  I think it's time for my 4th playthough...",1679214443,1708502750,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In it's current state this game has become one of my favorite rpgs and is by FAR the most immersive for me. I get absolutely lost in it's atmosphere, visuals and sound design and it's the first time I've been okay with 30-40fps to enable all the raytracing because it actually makes a huge difference. The story and characters while not perfect are honestly one of the best parts of this game imo along with everything I previously mentioned, also when you dance with someone you got romantic with in your apartment ""I really want to stay at your house"" plays and I straight cried (sweet moment combined with memories from the anime) which is something not many games have done for me. Oh yeah the gameplay is really fun too

EDIT: I had to come back to this review and say that after going out of my way to listen to more music from this game, Cyberpunk 2077 IMO has one of the best video game soundtracks especially when compared to it's direct competition (gta and watch dogs).

You can beat it in about 30 hours and I put in 60 more just so I could get through all the content. In classic CDPR style the script and roleplaying aspects are just fantastic. Everything feels compelling. It's gritty. Your choices matter and, even if the ones that don't impact the plot's direction are always actually acknowledged repeatedly in dialogue, which just makes the story feel real.

Now the complaining part: Playing on Linux/Proton, even with a 3080 I had constant visual glitches. I don't know if it's because of Proton, but it seemed like about half the scripted movements weren't synchronized with sound, voiceover almost never synched with mouth movements, pauses between parts of dialogue, lots of weird jumpy movements, the same NPC model being used 5-10x on screen (there was one scene before a concert where I saw ~20 of the same fangirl model), tearing even with vsync on, weird bloom filter bugs, and a slew of other visual glitches that detracted from immersion.

This game will keep you entertained for hours on end, with an amazing main story, compelling and engaging side stories and a ton of different playstyles at your disposal. Melee, time slowing samurai wielding katanas, gunplay, netrunners hacking and making enemies commit suicide; there are many, many ways to build and customize your character. 

However, the game does have cons. IMO, the game is extremely repetitive. Most of the gigs are just ""enter a building and kill everyone"" type missions over and over and over again. You obviously don't have to do them all, but as a completionist it's very grinding and tedious. It suffers from what I call ""Skyrim syndrome"" where there are so many gigs and side missions that you can easily lose yourself doing a bunch, easily grow overpowered and get bored since the gameplay is extremely repetitive. Even on the hardest difficulty, if you can push through the initial punishing low levels and grind your way to a decent amount of money, with the right build this game becomes a joke. Netrunners can just hit tab and not even enter a room and kill everyone in an entire base. At some point you're just become crazy strong with an endless amount of money. After using your Sandevistan to slice up everyone with your katana in 5 seconds without even taking damage for the umpteenth time, the game loses its fun value. Even unoptimized builds just become OP at some point. 

Still, the voice acting and story alone is worth it, and obviously you don't have to aim to complete every nook and cranny of the game. Despite its repetition, you'll find yourself doing multiple playthroughs in order to try different builds and make different decisions. The driving is also a bit janky IMO.

more:

i did almost every sidequest before beating the game and then got all the endings (except one that i apparently didn't meet the conditions for, but whatev). i was surprised how hard the endings hit, especially for phantom liberty. i had fun doing a bit of mild roleplay, given the opportunities throughout the game.

the combat usually made me wish i was playing a better shooter or better stealth game, since most of the time i wanted to play stealthily/non-lethally. if i actually killed as many enemies as the game put in front of me, it'd feel too ridiculous and unimmersive, so i tried to get by just knocking most people out. this became incredibly trivial by the late game with Overclock + System Reboot or whatever. melee was pretty bad, at least early on, so i didn't bother much with it. build variety seemed pretty good actually but doesn't really open up til late in the game, but with only one full respec available i didn't feel like getting funky with it. i just had some inefficient spread-all-over build and called it a day.

i wasn't too hot on keanu reeves after john wick but he nailed johnny silverhand. most people nailed their performance honestly. all the little facial expressions were real impressive in a game this big, especially in phantom liberty and especially with idris elba's character. i was glad that they had put the effort into making the conversations visually interesting like that, since they had committed to the first-person perspective. the phantom liberty theme song during the credits really knocked me out, man, i swear it alone did a ton of the heavy lifting. i don't really get emotional but that tugged even my heartstrings, man.",1607747445,1708476937,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I always had a love hate relationship with open world game. I loved the fastness of open world just for my joy to deminish once the world starts feeling empty after a few hours (Skyrim prime example). However, with 100 hours+ in this game the game world still feels active and never felt empty in my eyes yet. always something to do, something to find random encounter or gig. The numerous quests and story lines to follow just keeps sucking me into the game. 

This game really relit my gaming fire.

[u]12/5/2023 - Update 2.1:[/u]

It's getting there.  After the 2.1 update, I can finally say that I recommend the vanilla version of this game, flaws and all.  



Pro's:
- Graphics
- World design
- Voice acting
- The main story, sort of
- The side stories
- Gigs
- Apartments
- Clubs
- Arcade games
- Vehicles to drive
- Cop chases, if you're into that.
- Gangs in shootouts.
- Joytoys

Cons:
- Lack of player control.  The game is constantly taking control out of the player's hands during the main story.  May as well be a interactive movie really.
- Some side activities put behind a story wall (racing, rollercoaster, shooting gallery).
- Shooting gallery is a one-time event.
- Fighting arena is a quest and locked out once completed.
- Limited choices in the main story that actually matter.
- Extremely limited amount of minigames to enjoy, outside of questing and story.  Literally just a couple of arcade games.
- Everything feels static, even with the overhaul update.
- Lack of interactive elements in the world, outside of the story.
- Lack of drinking animations, outside of the story.
- Lack of eating animations, outside of the story.
- Limited activities to enjoy, outside of fighting, story, reading shards, and gigs.


This kind of game makes me wonder what the point of crafting an open world is.  A looking glass is quite boring to me, and this game definitely gives off that vibe.

Thankfully the modding scene really improves this game, but I refuse to recommend this game solely based on mods, as the vanilla game on it's own merits, falls short.

Be Aware that you will need a beast of a GPU to play this above 1080p. I have a 3080 and only get 40fps with all on ultra. DLSS Quality mode ups that to a playable 60.

Bugs Bugs Bugs. The fact that I can't stop playing this game despite all the bugs is a true testiment to the great game that it is.

Story is epic, side missions also fully flushed out storylines. Loads of odd jobs and things to do at any point.

Graphically, this game is incredible. The first believable city in any game ever. However the bugs that plague this game do take you out of immersion.

If you haven't bought the game, wait till you have a PC that can run it. Would recommend waiting 6 months or so for bug fixes to come out. 

My plan is to smash it through and 100% it now, then play again in 6months or a year on hardest setting with a different playthrough/build when the bugs and performance are fixed.

Thankfully on launch this game had a solid foundation of an impressively breathtaking world, atmosphere, characters and of course the story. Even with it's ""less than stellar launch"" to say the least. CDPR still does have the ability to craft a story that captivates the player into the world that CDPR has painstakingly created over the course of Cyberpunk's years in development. Now after years of patches and a DLC I'd say this game is where it should have been at launch. There are still some minor graphical bugs that I have experienced in my current playthough ( patch 2.11) but nothing that will hurt your overall experience with this game.  Though the dialogue reputation system still isn't as fleshed out as I would have liked.

CD Projekt Red made a concerted effort to salvage what had been one of the most disastrous video game launches in history. Despite their efforts, significant promised content is still missing from Cyberpunk 2077, even with the release of the DLC expansion, 'Phantom Liberty.' While I've enjoyed playing the game and have completed several playthroughs, it's unimaginably sad to see the vast potential the game has, while also being the biggest disappointment in my steam library.

There’s been a lot of cope and borderline delusion within the gaming community that many have with this game after 2.0 and Phantom Liberty that I’m exhausted by it.

2.0 brought huge nerfs to many builds, guns especially. Melee was already the best build prior, now it’s the most viable build by a huge margin that requires the least amount of effort. 

A subsequent patch brought level-scaling into this “RPG”, transforming a game that was originally a cybernetic-filled power-fantasy for 3 years into an action game where all the enemies are bullet sponges and your progression is ultimately meaningless.

Cyberpunk also puts the least amount of effort into being an RPG. Your background doesn’t matter, you have no impact on the main story, and the story itself is extremely linear with many unskippable sections. Character customization is some of the worst I’ve seen in a AAA “RPG” and offers little freedom in character appearance.

Driving is a complete travesty. Vehicles seem to hold no weight or friction with the ground and the handling, acceleration, and braking is all over the place. Heard it’s better on controller but I shouldn’t have to bust out another peripheral to use a basic mechanic. 

Story itself is also notably boring and filled to the brim with pointless fluff due to how the endings play out. All of the endings within the game make all of your efforts meaningless, which means the game is a slog to play through again as you know the story is not only long but filled to the brim with ultimately pointless events. The writers also throw out all logic and previous established facts in favor of making dark, unfulfilling endings that basically spit in the player’s face.

In the end, Cyberpunk is still a bad game in my eyes. 2.0 may have made the game more stable but overhauling the perk system to be a worse version of the previous one, adding level scaling so that all of your character progression being pointless, and nerfing builds and weapons makes this game still bad in my eyes.

Hopefully Witcher 4 and whatever the ORION sequel is will be good but CDPR has a massive black mark in its image in my eyes.",1708406545,1708406545,False,2,0,0.460709214210510254,0,True,False,False

**((Review below was before Rework!!! apply this review if you are playing cyberpunk pre-rework))**
On my 2nd play-through basically doing mostly every side gig and crime spots and getting to max level and i intend on doing a 3rd and maybe a 4th, 5th, etc after installing some mods, to make it clear, ive played the game twice before considering mods for a few reasons; 

1) DLC. Any updates to Cyberpunk will likely break any mods you install so ive been waiting on DLC announcements, seems likely to drop around Q3/Q4 this year. 

2) Wanted to enjoy the world in its ""vanilla"" state without modding, helps you understand the basics and how the game operates as an RPG shooter, even discover tech like mantis blade hoppin for faster moment in the streets or relying on base rarity satori for the entire first playthrough and pretending to be Genji half the time. 

While i recommend this game~ i suggest get it on a sale as this game isn't without it's ""quarks"".

The police in this game without mods are terrible, they can't even chase you in cars cause they have no driving A.I. other than scripted events and when you commit crimes cops spawn out of thin air literally behind you, ie where you currently are not looking towards, while that kinda kills immersion, you'll end up not wanting to do your typical ""GTA rampage"" in this game cause its just not fun to fight the police. 

Game subtly breaking in ways over time(Menus taking longer than normal, slow downs happen, drop in visual fidelity, map waypoint acting goofy as heck, terrain popping), good thing there are many times it ""auto saves"" and has multiple backups in case things go south, which playing though the game once or twice will train you to notice when this is about to happen so you can preemptively restart the game at a safe spot. 

and a common problem is sometimes the elevator buttons break cause they're tied to a graphics bug and it doesn't let you press it cause the screen prompt never changes or stays black. fixes upon reloading a save. 

While i have listed all these negatives about the game, Fans can come though can pump more life into a game you really find fascinating and that's another reason why i've waited on modding, cause i wanna enjoy this world as long as possible~ i wanna keep exploring Night City, have over 250 hours playing up to my second character so far and even now when i drive around the city, it still feels so unfamiliar that i wanna keep driving around, cruising all the streets to see whats around the next block, it's just so vast that you truly feel like a tiny grain of sand in a giant world. 

Even if you just play the story once, very much worth it just to have as a game you can then chill and have a fun time cruising Night City's streets.",1681792515,1708397336,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Everything from sounds, visuals, game-play and story all line up great. With my 2080S and R9-3900X, the game runs fairly well on High settings (cant do ultra/ray-tracing etc), I had a solid 60fps for *most* of the game, with noticeable drops only in the high clutter areas of the DLC zone. Sound quality is great, loved all of the musical choices, with the voice acting work being amazing. I think Keanu Reeves and Idris Elba absolutely killed it in their roles. 

Game play is fun and the various skill trees feel diverse enough that each tree feels distinct. I personally did a throwing dagger build for my hard play-through. It was a bit clunky at first, but once I got a few of the perks and decent daggers, it was amazing being able to run around and chain stun and/or one-shot mobs. 

I also have to mention that the DLC Phantom Liberty is possibly one of the best DLCs I've played.

Lets forgo the elephant sized irony of a game about a guy rallying the little guy against the corps who use the people and con them which was made by a corporation who...shock horror, lied to their fans about the state of the game and still took their money. We leave the greed to others my ass.

I had high hopes for this game and although it definitely had it moments it wasnt enough to cover up the bugs, glitches, stupid one liners, horrible music and a litany of other tripe they shoehorned into this game for no reason other than it seemed like a good idea at the time.

FEELINGS:

Best game I have ever played. Never felt more like I was part of their world. So much to do. So much to see. nothing, and I mean nothing wrong with taking the back streets (there's a lot to do there). The game is so choc-full of interesting things to lose yourself in, it's almost overwhelming how much people throw at you, to the point I seriously considered just shutting my phone off and going back to my apartment to sleep (in-game). Amazing. 

Besides that, the city and the people just draw you in. (Almost) everything looks amazing, and it's backed up by an incredible soundscape that absolutely immerses you into the beautiful hellscape that is Night City. If you've got at least a decent GPU, you can crank it to 11 and forget what reality is like I did. 

And the gameplay! AHHHHH! Swords! Throwing knives! GUNS GUNS GUNS! You can even sneak up on people and knock them out if you're an over-thinker like me! Million and one ways to approach a situation, and the game responds to it. Speaking of responding, this game has got Baldur's Gate-level memory and flow. I've had so many moments where I pieced something together myself, thinking I was clever, only to realize the devs had thought of that and accounted for it. That, and just... 10/10 storytelling. The characters... whew. Not gonna spoil it for you.

The weakest part of this game are two issues: hardware optimization and the bugs that show from time to time. First off, the game hogs CPU. I have an 11700f and it can get as high as 97% usage while playing. Whew. I played around with the graphics settings a little and managed to get my benchmark at a smooth 59 average FPS, only to notice I was still getting 8-10 frame drops in various parts of the city. Weirdly enough, turning some settings back up brought the frames back. Completely backwards, but good... I guess? 

There also seems to be a small memory leak somewhere, as I start losing frames around maybe the two-hour mark. Which leads me to my next issue: the bugs. Janky shadows, footstep sounds disappearing now and then, weird physics ragdolls and uncanny twists/movements. once saw two stacked boxes start vibrating and spin on the spot. Not sure what happened there. Anyways. There are probably more bugs that I've missed, but while I can say they can be annoying, the rest of the game is so good I really don't hate these bugs like I might otherwise. Cyberpunk really is that good. 

P.S. I've had one, singular crash. I smacked a boss enemy as they were crossing a barrier and that just absolutely toasted the game. No idea why. But in my 62 hours played, that's the only crash I've had. 


CONCLUSION:

Get it. Best game I have ever played. Never felt more like I've been part of a fantasy world before. If you like single-player games that you can get a lot of hours out of (and have a hell of a time doing it), this is the one.  

That's all for now, choom. Gotta delta. Got a city to burn.

Combat system in many regards is dull. Enemies are bulet spunges and even headshoots are not so deadly.
While I get it when you fight some more mech than human enemies, when ""normal enemie"" after headshot from sniper rifle still stands and is able to alert others then I'm a bit ""annoyed"". Melee combat might be more ""action paced"" and I havn't give it proper chance, but still gun fights I would expect to be more action than constant drag. 
It can be changed with mods for way more deadly guns for both sideds, headshot is deadly also for player untill you are chromed up a lot. But game also assumes at few points that you can start fight without any cover vs few enemies and those points can be frustraiting to load save back only becuse you die just after start of encounter and got flatlined by some stray bullet over and over untill you get some luck with getting to any cover and regaining control over fight.
Would not count it as bad per se, just not my type of combat system. Also it might be better later on and I havn't gave it enough chance but after ~10h I was so bored in combat so I've moded it out just to keep playing at all.

Driving... I don't get how game with so much travel while driving can have so bad driving. Maybe with pad and more granual control it would be better but on keyboard it was very rarely plesant experience. While still not great I would say only vechicle that was ""acceptable"" are bikes.

Bugs. First ever I've played is in 2.1. So game is declared ""finished"". While nothing was geambreaking, few times I was forced to either to restart game as something gliched (blury vision stayed for good after relic malfunction, some quest locking item was not possible to interact with) or go back to previous save and replay part of game (I think it was only once). Sometimes it is enough to go away until lost sight of gliched object but if not save/load doesnt solve it, reloading game is required. And if you go far away from point of some decision NPC might progress with quest futher, so better to save and restart anyway.
Additionaly some minor stuff when car havn't loaded and npc riderd around without it, NPC havn't loaded in time on curb and I've ""discovered their existance"" only due to getting police on my tail for ramming them with car.

Interfaceing with world. Some guns/bodies my fall in to textures and be unaccessable. Some items are accessable only from narrow angle/distance and activating it might be a bit annoying. Some zones are simply of limits to cars, not blocked by some obstacle but car will stop on its own and wont go futer or will hit invisible wall, while on foot you can go through. While those were kinda places where you would not be expected to drive (like up stairs to some pedestrian zone) some visible obstacle would be better choice.

Endings. [Spoilers ahead, nonspecific but still]... [spoiler]While generaly I was ok with them, one is hidden. To access it you need to do one certain conversation in very specific way. And game doesn't give any hint to it while still you get comment later on suggesting it is kinda ""best choice"" to not risk death of any of friends. I just don't get why going solo is hidden option for last mission.[/spoiler]

Romance. I'm not attached to it's existance in game but it is in game so it is also part I would judge it by.
Untill choosing romance option it is quite OK. But after finishing main story for that NPC and taking romance option it felt so hollow. 
You can meet up just to only have same few lines of text constantly. 
I would expect to have some discussion about progress in story, getting advice/getting reaction to choosen actions.
Or not having romance option at all. In end that I woudl call better option then having it in game as it is. 
Maybe just one I've picked is so badly written but any interaction with that NPC after quest line was like afterthought hastly put in to game.

In the end I'm not wanting my 60h/cash back but likely I would not reccomend it to my self to buy if my past self would ask.",1708372503,1708372503,False,1,0,0.500700771808624268,0,True,False,False

The gameplay is good but at the end of the day, it's simple.
It never gets stale, but won't change or improve much, throughout the game.

Npc's are walking around with the coolest metalic arms, legs, faces, and unique clothing that you cannot get access to.

Cyberpunk's themes of hopelessness feel really poignant at a time in our lives where we are inching towards the ultra capitalist dystopian future that is everpresent in Night City.
A hopelessness that everyone of us have felt toward a system, a structure that strips us of our agency, and makes us feel worthless.
The game is filled with tragic characters that are like us, fighting for their place in a world that detests them.

The highlight of this game are it's superb npcs, River, Judy, Evelyn, Panam, Jackie, Takemura, Reed, Kerry and of course Johnny.
With their own personalities, outlooks on life, fighting for their own cause, most of them against an everpresent exploitative structure.

Enter Phantom Liberty, always kept me on edge, not knowing which character was going to get killed in the next quest, whether someone was lying through their teeth or being sincere. So Mi, Solomon and Alex all felt like true friends. Eventually you have to choose an ending which ultimately someone else suffers because of your choices.

Cyberpunk 2077 Was basically the laughing stock of gaming industry at launch. However, with the update 2.1, The Devs finally called the game complete.

One big issue is that firearms, at extremely close ranges, have a delay between when I shoot and when the hit occurs.  There should be no perceptible delay between firing and the rounds striking the target but it feels like it's somewhere in the 0.25 second range which is ridiculous.  That's the kind of delay you'd expect at a moderate range, not at a distance of under 50 feet.    A .22 rim fire round can travel at over 1000 feet per second, 0.25 seconds would put it at 250 feet, 50 feet should only take 0.05 seconds, and a lot of the shots I've fired, and had a delay on, are likely at 25 feet or less - a 0.025 second delay at most, so why is there such a massive delay for short distances?

The vehicles handle like garbage, it's beyond terrible.  There's no excuse for that and it's definitely something I don't like.  I tend to walk around a lot instead of taking a vehicle.  Yeah, it's that bad.

Crafting is pretty bad and it doesn't make much sense that you can do it anywhere at any time.  No crafting benches required.  Wish they'd gone a slightly different route with item rarity, it works but it doesn't feel like it's the right fit for this game.

The world is not empty, but it often feels kind of empty even in the middle of the city.

I kind of like the random stuff I can stumble across, like crimes in progress that I can choose to ignore or interact with but I have an issue with the items strewn across the world.  I find it kind of ridiculous that so much junk is just lying around that I can pick up or steal with no consequences.  I do like that I can always loot a few items from enemies, I tend to dislike games that don't let you loot what enemies have, but this game does allow you to pick up some weapons and items, though it's certainly not everything the enemies would be carrying.  I don't seem to pick up much ammo from enemies, or cash/credsticks for that matter.

Combat isn't that bad even with the firearm delay issue.  Character customization isn't bad either.  I don't mind the story so far, and in fact at times I really feel immersed so that's nice.  The UI isn't terrible but could be better - especially the inventory management.  I like the overall look of the game, and it runs pretty well on my older system with just a few things turned down a bit.

I did like the idea of the brain dance, and how you can go through a scene to evaluate things.  It was a nice surprise, I didn't know about it before I played.  It's done fairly well.

I do like the variety in gear, weapons, and options for dealing with situations.  It reminds me a bit of the original Deus Ex.  I can try to be sneaky, go in guns blazing, or use other methods.  Having a high tech skill comes in handy to bypass security systems as does being extremely stealthy or being an absolute physical beast or expert with guns.  They did a pretty good job, for the most part, letting me try to play my way - except for the few sections where you are forced ""use this garbage pistol"" instead of the weapons I actually have equipped.  That shouldn't be a thing.

So, it's no Witcher 3, but overall it's certainly not a bad game.  I think it was a very ambitious project that just didn't quite work out but it's certainly worth playing.",1648888895,1708352908,True,1,0,0.440081238746643066,2,True,False,False

Set in a dystopian future where mega-corporations hold unchecked power and cybernetic enhancements are the norm, Cyberpunk 2077 presents a rich tapestry of storytelling, exploration, and player choice.

One of the most striking aspects of Cyberpunk 2077 is its breathtaking attention to detail in crafting the world of Night City. From the bustling markets of Japantown to the seedy underbelly of the Combat Zone, each district feels alive with its own distinct personality and culture. The sheer scale and verticality of the city are awe-inspiring, inviting players to explore every corner and uncover the secrets hidden within its neon-soaked streets.

At the heart of Cyberpunk 2077 lies its deep and immersive narrative, driven by a cast of memorable characters and morally ambiguous choices. As V, a mercenary seeking to make a name for themselves in Night City, players will encounter a diverse array of allies and adversaries, each with their own agendas and motivations. From the enigmatic rockerboy Johnny Silverhand to the ruthless corporate fixer Dexter DeShawn, the game's cast is brought to life with stunning performances and nuanced writing that keeps players guessing until the very end.

But perhaps the most ambitious aspect of Cyberpunk 2077 is its commitment to player agency and choice. Throughout the game, players will be faced with a myriad of decisions that will not only shape the fate of V but also the future of Night City itself. From choosing which factions to align with to determining the outcome of key story missions, every choice feels meaningful and impactful, allowing players to craft their own unique experience in the world of Cyberpunk.

Of course, no discussion of Cyberpunk 2077 would be complete without mentioning its stunning visuals and immersive atmosphere. The game's cutting-edge graphics engine brings Night City to life with breathtaking detail, from the gleaming skyscrapers of the corporate sector to the gritty alleyways of the combat zones. Combined with a dynamic day-night cycle and weather system, the result is a world that feels alive and vibrant, begging to be explored and experienced.

In conclusion, Cyberpunk 2077 is a monumental achievement in gaming, offering players a rich and immersive experience that pushes the boundaries of storytelling and player choice. With its stunning visuals, compelling narrative, and deep gameplay mechanics, it stands as a testament to the power of interactive entertainment to transport players to new and exciting worlds. While not without its flaws, Cyberpunk 2077 remains a must-play for fans of the genre and anyone looking to lose themselves in a dystopian future unlike any other.",1708349124,1708349124,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

After playing some time I can say I do not like plot twist which is taken here. I liked very much grinding and gaining experience and then it was abruptly cut in half. I am not here for seeking this.

Makes you wonder how much big tobacco paid to have every character you interact with in this game be a pathetic and helplessly addicted chain smoker. In a world where chemicals are injected directly into your bloodstream through bioimplants, it's beyond hyper unrealistic to have everyone chain smoking like it's the 1950s.

I've never had so much smoke blown in my face during conversations. There's even an interactive cutscene pressuring your character to start smoking. Then later a cutscene where you have no choice but to enable someone who had quit smoking to start up again. She then starts chain smoking during every future interaction.

First person GTA is how most people describe this game. But it's more like first person Far Cry mixed with Mass Effect. Either way it's a fun ride. Tons of cameo's and Easter eggs to keep it fun. If you've ever played a Yakuza game you'll feel right at home in Night City.

Some of the best parts of Cyberpunk are the worldbuilding, atmosphere, and immersion. The story telling might not be the best out there, but I believe it to be far above average with a unique sci-fi theme. The game is not perfect by any means and I acknowledge it is most certainly not a game for Everyone, but some people will find it to be incredible. I suggest everyone to try the game at least especially if you're familiar with the cyberpunk aesthetic.

Like I said the game has flaws, but they aren't fatal to overall enjoyment of the game. In some ways the flaws add to the charm and identity of the game itself. It really feels like the modern day Skyrim. Not perfect, but a Skyrim with no jank would've been less iconic which is why we still see many people playing the original over SSE. Cyberpunk is the same way. Of course many of these flaws can be fixed with mods like the atrocious driving for example.

Despite its flaws, I feel that Cyberpunk more than any other game I've played, was built with a personal touch. I found myself increasingly more impressed by how many things were clearly constructed by a human with intent and not copy pasted. From side character dialogue to city scenery, level layout and cut scenes, I feel CDPR tried as hard as they possibly could to make the world feel real and lived in as well as give many side quests the same gravitas as the main story. The issue is a city has so much density and time as a resource is not infinite so the areas where sacrifices were made may at times make the game feel more low budget. I think this was the biggest negative for Cyberpunk and why so many people felt their expectations were not met, which is why I recommend going in to this game blind and enjoying it for what it is. People had such high expectations pre-release that anything less than a literal simulation of a real life future city wouldn't have measured up which is simply not possible with modern technology.

Ultimately Cyberpunk will be a memorable and iconic game for me even though many did not like it. The game is fun and worth it for the price which is really all that matters.",1702607111,1708325395,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

To be fair, my first time jumping in was after the acclaimed 2.0 update from the game studio, so I have no experience with the game's perks and mechanics pre-overhaul. I had, however, heard the game was a crappier Grand Theft Auto clone with nothing new on offer.

And that is just untrue.

You can build your character with the perk trees and accrue different cyberware to enhance combat, stealth, and dialogue, yet the fundamentals seemed very similar to GTA. Still, the story still was intriguing enough for me to want more. The cast's performances were all of the highest caliber, the branching paths dictated by your actions and dialogue choices had that trademark CDPR handprint, and the world was so meticulously crafted, with each district and remote region all feeling distinct and having a personality of their own. And with numerous endings, you'll want to play it again because the satisfaction of completion is not enough, strangely, but because the investment you feel in characters such as V, Johnny Silverhand, Panem, among others. My only true complaint with the base game is that there is no New Game Plus mode, yet I suppose I understand CDPR's decision on that matter since it would break some of the lore and world building of the story that you experience.

As for Phantom Liberty, don't expect a bombastic shoot-em-up action FPS that I initially expected. Instead, a slow-burn (not boring, there is a difference) that delves deeply into the politics of this world, taking its time to introduce a plot enshrouded by deception, espionage, drama, and investigation, while sprinkling in the combat and action throughout tastefully. With elements reminding me of Mission: Impossible, James Bond, Alien: Isolation, Blade Runner, among other great political thrillers and spy movies, I feel this expansion aligned with what most initially expected with Cyberpunk's initial launch over three years ago, with an emotional climax that I didn't quite experience with my first ending of the base game.

I did initially play the first 50 hours of the game at no cost to me, borrowing from a friend's game library, and ended up purchasing the Ultimate Edition because I knew that Night City would be place I will return to again and again, choosing different lifepaths and discovering the numerous different outcomes I almost chose first time around, and discovering so much more that I know I completely missed. 

If you enjoy modding your games, you may also want to visit Nexus for a mod that increases the level cap (The cap is only Level 50 in the base game, Level 60 with Phantom Liberty) to take advantage of the dozens of shiny new toys and skills CDPR shoves into this mammoth of a title.

Parents' Guide: The violence is not extremely gory, probably on par with what you would find in a Bethesda Fallout game. The game does have quite a bit of sexual content, yet does allow you to censor nudity in the Accessibility menu (thankfully, as I have two young kids who watch me from time to time). The language is course and pervasive. Not sure if there is a mod that disables the coursest language (F-bombs, C-words), however I am sure they exist.

I was one of the people hyped for this game at launch and then disappointed by it. They definitely seemed to have fixed it with 2.0 update and it is worth playing.

 The main story is pretty short and I feel like you don't get a lot of time with your late game build even if you do all the side missions.

 To me, Night City itself was the real star of the show. Might be in my top five game settings of all time. Beautifully done, dystopian, Cyberpunk city. I would like a sequel in this universe. Doesn't have to be Night City but another futuristic city would be cool to explore. 

 Lots of good voice acting. I really liked Keanu Reeves' contribution. He really made Johnny Silverhand. There are tons of well acted side characters as well. I did not buy the DLC but it would probably also be worth it on sale. 

 Combat is pretty fun and varied, but, it is also easy to find the few things that work for you and just never, ever deviate from them. In that sense it can be a little samey if you don't force yourself to change things up. The automatic weapons (assault rifles and sub-machine guns) to me were kinda meh. The real fun, in my opinion, lies in swords, pistols, stealth and hacking, aka netrunning.

What a fantastic fps/rpg. One of my favorites I've played in recent memory. Fantastic characters, interesting quests (both side and main), intriguing story and satisfying choices all throughout. Gameplay had satisfying variety and I enjoyed it giving you the option to play how you want, even if it's not the most viable. Fun amounts of customization. Played it with the Phantom Liberty DLC, which I saved for last and was the cherry on top of an incredible game. 

I was also surprised how stable it was over my entire playthrough, with only two very serious bugs encountered throughout my 130 hours exploring everything I could find. Didn't have internet for most of my playthrough, but another compliment to CD Projeckt for allowing me to play the game without internet connection, and not even logged into steam, seemingly DRM free. Something you can't do anymore with any other AAA game.

Performance was also solid on my 2080 with only 4GB of vram, was getting solid 90fps with some DLSS settings enabled, but no visual hit to my untrained eye. Just make sure you have it installed on an SSD.

Exploring Night City is a lot of fun to explore on foot and in vehicle (very reminiscent of Sleeping Dogs, I wish the soundtrack was as good.) 
I just finished the quest line that has been in all of the adds and trailers and it was still engaging even though I knew what was going to happen, that storyline is basically the training quest for the rest of the game.

If you're looking for a game to blindly sink hours into without much care of the story, this is not for you. 
HOWEVER 
If you're looking for a story rich game with beautiful graphics, and a bit of a challenge, look no further.

It's no secret this game had a rough start, but the comeback has been more than worth the rough patch. 

Pros:
Graphics - absolutely stunning
Gameplay - plenty of activities to break up the main story
Map - large enough to take those thinkin cruises
Weapons - large selection of pew pew and swipe slashes
Hacking - The all around concept is awesome, both people and machines
Character Development - almost too good

Cons: 
Driving - just don't play gta prior to this game
Multiplayer - Doesn't exist.

This game is almost completely different now in a good way. I will admit that I was wrong about not seeing a No Man's Sky trajectory, they really did fix the game. While I do think this game should remain as a cautionary tale against pre ordering, it is clear that CDPR was not afraid to scrap a lot of work to rebuild much of the game from scratch. I admire the ability to admit that things didnt work well and starting over instead of ignoring reality (the starfield approach).


**Original Review** I have been waiting for the game devs to do some fixing and following the changelog on their website since release. Despite being broken at launch I didnt leave a negative review because I did think CDPR would do right by us in time and fix it. However, when I tried the game again most recently I had a revelation that I don't know if you can fix the games biggest issue through a patch - Its just not fun. Even when it hits all its notes, and this still few and far between, I just find myself wishing I was having a good time rather then actually having one. I have a lot of respect for the CDPR team and still consider them some of the best in the biz, but despite a good story and interesting characters, I cant recommend this game even as an investment for future patches.

CDPR admitted their mistakes, rolled up their sleeves, and in time turned this game into a jaw-dropping, cinematic experience.

Writing, atmosphere, style, combat, exploration, driving together blend into a very impressive game.
CP2077 is not a ""true"" RPG - it lacks roleplay depth  and real consequences in dialogue. It is not really an immersive sim - there are no emergent synergies. It typically offers an illusion of choice, unlike Deus Ex.
It is a *mostly* linear, well written and directed cinematic experience.

However, CP2077 strikes a great balance. Every mechanic is satisfying enough to form an amazing game. There are quite a few approaches to combat and ""classes"" to play as.

It's a ""Ghost in the Shell"" futuristic type of cyberpunk, not a retro 80s or ""near future grounded"" cyberpunk.

After revisiting Cyberpunk 2077, I have to admit, my opinion of the game has changed. Yes, I still have to acknowledge the numerous bugs and horrible AI, but despite these shortcomings, I found myself enjoying the game much more than I initially anticipated.

I'm a picky gamer, and it's been years since I've spent more than a few hours playing a game per week, but with Cyberpunk 2077, I clocked in 80 hours of gameplay within the first week. The story is fantastic, the gameplay is exciting, and the dystopian setting is brilliantly executed. Even now, months after playing, I find myself missing the game.

However, after 100% completing the game, with all main and side quests, collectibles, and vehicles bought, I found myself with nothing left to do. This highlights the lack of new content since launch. CDPR's few updates have been minor fixes, and the promised DLC is nowhere in sight.

Additionally, there are numerous features missing that should have been in the game since launch, such as character appearance customization, relationships, romance, player choices, vehicle customization, and realistic NPCs.

Although I came into the game with high expectations, I still found myself loving it. CDPR didn't make the perfect game, but they created a world that caught my attention and kept me engaged. Despite its flaws, Cyberpunk 2077 is a game that I will not forget.

Every single thing that was promised through the marketing is either outright not in the game, or is hopelessly underdone, and the various bits and bobs you do get here are very poorly done.

Story:
V is NOT the main character here.  After the first few hours this becomes ""The Johnny Silverhand Show"" and everything starts revolving around him.   If you're obsessed with Keanu Reeves, you'll probably enjoy it, but if you were expecting a deep and branching storyline you'll be sorely disappointed.

RNG:
Pretty much every piece of gear you get will have totally random stats.  This goes both for container loot, enemy loot, and even crafted gear.  It feels less like a proper RPG, and more like you're playing Borderlands.  It's not the worst thing in the world, but it feels very out of place and leads to constantly changing out your gear after every fight.  Your loadout will never have any sort of permanence.

Lifepaths:
The lifepath system that was so heavily anticipated is totally pointless.  The first ten minutes of the game are unique, but then the entire rest of your playthrough will be identical no matter what lifepath you chose.  You'll occasionally get some extra dialog options, but they amount to flavor text and nothing else.

Romance:
You get 4 options total, but can only access 2 per playthrough depending on V's gender.  The romancable characters are pretty well written, but the sheer lack of variety is disappointing.

Customization:
Very lacking here too.  The character creator is lackluster, even compared to much older games, and you have no option to alter your appearance later in the game.  Clothing, weapon and vehicle appearance is completely out of your hands.  If you want to look like a cyborg, too bad.  You get to be a plain jane human with some lines on your skin if you want.

I could keep going ad nauseum, but I think I've said enough here.  It's not a bad game, but it is NOT the game we were promised at all.[/spoiler]

EDIT:
So, it's been a while.  Plenty of updates, and many more hours of playtime have gone by, and frankly these words are long overdue.  Do some of my original points still stand?  Yes, absolutely.  However, considering the No Man's Sky degree of glow-up this game has received, I'm willing to overlook my previous gripes.  I respect all the extra work that CDPR has put into this project, and I can confidently say this has risen into my top 10 favorite games.",1609203562,1708280561,True,0,0,0.504573166370391846,0,True,False,False

In this tapestry of silicon and circuitry, wrought by the alchemists of CD Projekt Red, we traverse the neon-lit boulevards of Night City—a metropolis teeming with rogues, renegades, and rhapsodies. Behold, the protagonist, V, a mercenary of singular mettle, ensnared in a web of intrigue and cybernetic sorcery.

The tale unfolds thus: V, a cipher for our own desires, grapples with the specter of Johnny Silverhand—a rockstar turned insurgent, whose consciousness echoes within V’s neural lattice. Keanu Reeves, that luminary of the silver screen, lends his visage to this digital revenant, though his performance, like a blade dulled by time, lacks the luster of his co-stars.

Yet fret not, for the heart of this saga lies not in the stilted cadence of its thespians, but in the myriad quests that weave its fabric. Side missions, like constellations strewn across the firmament, beckon with promises of intrigue, heartache, and revelation. Each choice, a filament spun upon the loom of fate—shall we aid the downtrodden nomads or dance with corporate devils? To romance the rogue AI or unmask the enigma of a cybernetic ghost?

And lo, the cityscape! Night City sprawls like a dragon’s hoard, its skyscrapers scraping the heavens, its alleys echoing with whispered secrets. Neon glimmers like stolen stars, and the streets pulse with life—a symphony of chrome and chaos.

Yet, as with any grand opus, blemishes mar its visage. Bugs, like digital imps, cavort through its code, disrupting immersion and rending the veil of illusion. Alas, poor rendering! Alas, clipping textures! Yet, these flaws, like wrinkles upon a time-worn visage, do not diminish the soul of Cyberpunk 2077.

For within its circuits, choice blooms like a rare orchid. We sculpt our V—gender fluid, visage scarred, backstory etched in binary. Shall we wield the blade or the netrunner’s code? To augment our flesh or transcend it? The world, our oyster, awaits our whims.

And so, I raise my goblet to thee, Cyberpunk 2077—a flawed masterpiece, a digital sonnet, a brave new world where pixels and poetry entwine. May your patches mend thy wounds, and may your legacy endure like the echoes of a long-departed rockstar.

Fare thee well, Night City, and may your neon burn eternal.",1702262680,1708279669,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Notes:
Graphics are excellent - if you turn on RT Overdrive, that is. Otherwise, they're still pretty good, but nothing to write home about. Aesthetics are where it's at though - the visual design of Cyberpunk is great and is very well-realised here.

Gameplay is fine - car controls are shite but shooting feels ""alright"" in my books. Wish the default movement speed was a bit higher.

Story is decent so far, but not as immediately gripping as The Witcher 3 or Baldur's Gate 3 were for me. Mostly carried by an excellent main voice cast and a decent, if mixed, cast of side characters. Standouts for me are Evelyn, Dexter, Jackie and Viktor. The protagonist, weirdly enough, isn't that fun to listen to after the initial cool factor wears off. My advice is that the female voice is better than the male one, so play a fem V.

The game is far less buggy now than at launch but still has some rather rough edges. I bumped against a ladder and died instantly just now. Weird. The game's performance also tanks every single time I bring up a menu, and the initial loading screens are laggy as shit too. That's on great hardware - a Gen 4 NVME drive, 5900X and RTX 4070 Super with 64GB of RAM. Alan Wake and other RT games seem to have similar issues with opening/closing menus, so maybe that's why.

Update Feb 2024 (Patch 2.11 + Phantom Liberty DLC):
Despite disastrous launch at 2020, the developers have been constantly updated the game and fulfilled most of their promises. Kudos to CDPR.

Massive overhaul to the talent tree, perk, and cyberware systems. Now each build feels more ""specialized"" rather than the original talent progression which feels more like cookie-cutter ""jack-of-all trades"". Although at the end-game (level 45+), the combat felt relatively easy (except the MaxTac team at 5th wanted star).

The Phantom Liberty DLC brings a fresh air with its amazing espionage story and superb soundtracks. The end credit song ""Phantom Liberty"" deserves award.

Not to mention the random dead ends everywhere where super soldiers shoot you dead instantly - absolutely does not feel like a real city where you can drive around and reasonably get to places. The game even plots routes for you that you cannot use because at some point you reach ""turn around, there is nothing here"". Finally, the spawn system is incredibly primitive, constantly producing duplicate, triplicate, etc. vehicles and NPCs, further eroding any hope of immersion.

Having plunged into Cyberpunk 2077 in December 2023 with the fully updated experience, the Ultimate Edition and DLC in tow, I found myself immersed in a futuristic adventure. While the base game was solid, the customization options, particularly for the body, lacked realism. Thankfully, the modding community, with gems like HystBody, Unequip mods, Nightcity Alive, Realcollour III LUT and more, breathed new life into the game.

⚙️ Mods Enhance the Experience:

HystBody Mods: A game-changer for realistic body customization.
Unequip Mods: Adding flexibility and immersion.
Realcolour III LUT: Elevating visuals and atmosphere.
Night City Alive: More engaging NPC's and making night city worthy of its reputation. 

🎮 Base Game vs. DLC:

The base game was enjoyable, but the DLC stole the spotlight. Kudos to Kurt Hansen, Mr. Blue Eyes, and the DLC creators for a captivating narrative. Exciting hints of potential space and air travels left me eager for more.

👏 Shoutouts:

A salute to Kurt Hansen for exceptional work.
Tip of the hat to Mr. Blue Eyes for an intriguing presence.
Shoutout to all the modders. 

🌌 Future Expectations:

The DLC teased grand possibilities, sparking excitement for what's to come. Fingers crossed for space and air travels in the future.

🚀 Conclusion:

Cyberpunk 2077, with the aid of mods and stellar DLC content, evolves into a remarkable journey through Night City. A testament to the community's dedication and a promising sign for the game's future. Despite the base game's solid enjoyment, the need for mods to enhance the experience slightly hampers the overall score. Exciting possibilities teased in the DLC leave room for optimism. A futuristic journey with notable highs and a reliance on community enhancements.

It's very story-driven, and I didn't enjoy exploring and do side quests much. That sense of aimlessly wandering in an open world and enjoying it just wasn't there, unfortunately. I bought it on discount and don't regret it. I'll definitely see through to the ending of the story because it immerses you nicely in the cyber world and story is top tier. However, as an RPG game, it didn't feel all that great. Also, there are quite a few small bugs here and there. Some bugs are minor annoyances, while others are pretty frustrating. I was happy to see that there weren't any game-breaking bugs, although my phone glitched once and I couldn't call anybody until I restarted the game.

Did that, then started Phantom Liberty, rescued the president but i can't be bothered pretending or trying anymore.

This may be some peoples perfect game, and that's excellent. Just isn't for me.
Worth noting I've never had any glitches or crashes that others experienced.

I just don't personally like the game, that's all.

Even when it came out and was an absolute nightmare mess I still loved it because the story is something I connect with on a deep level. I have a tattoo for this game okay. At this time I genuinely can't recommend it. I want to because Phantom Liberty and Update 2.0 seem really cool but I am not allowed to play them. My game crashes and the only fix is to repeatedly delete my settings file. I have scoured the internet and tried every fix under the sun. Nothing but the .json file tied to my in game settings fixes it. Which means if I play the game I have to delete my settings file, redo my settings, never reload the game for any reason, and repeat every time I do want to load the game. 

Now I even have the game on PS5 which you'd think would be the solution but the controls are so unfathomably dog water on their, that I would rather take a razor and saw the tattoo off my own arm than actually play it. So don't bother.

I have reached out to CDPR support and am awaiting their suggestions and if they magically fix this or update I will change my review a bit but at this time I think you'd be better off putting concrete in your shoes and trying to win a 100 meter dash against Usain Bolt because that would be more possible and less frustrating than trying to piece a working version of this mess together.",1708235937,1708235937,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I put it away for about a year. 

I then made the wise move to complete Starfield. I know. I know. But it was a blessing in disguise. After finishing Starfield (which I did enjoy because I'm a masochist and I like boring old Bethesda fetch sims).

The news of 2.0 dropped. Then DLSS 3 support. The mod community was already hard at work doing their best to fix the game along side CDPR. All these moments created a perfect storm. In the end, we got an amazing game. Was it the fully promised game? Of course not. It never is. But this is truly a special game.

The pacing, the story line, the many options on how to solve a problem. It really does immerse you in the world. I love exploring worlds. I can just walk the streets of San Andreas or New Hanover for hours. I found Night City an excellent place to just wander around. To me, that is the hallmark of a true living, breathing city.

BUT, from the 11 hours I have spent on this game, I can't get enough of it.
When this game was being marketed, I really didn't care. I was too busy playing Space Engineers and reading Iain M. Banks' The Culture or The Expanse, and then Halo Reach was announced for MCC alongside a PC port of the entire MCC over the coming year, so that (and Halo Infinite's marketing) occupied my brain at the time.
Plus, my old PC didn't have a hope of running this game. It had trouble running the games I was playing for crying out loud, let alone a brand new game.
And then the virus hit, and everything (but MCC) got delayed. So when the game launched in late 2020, after a message stating that it would be delayed to 2021, I was surprised. And the launch was a steaming pile of crap.
The game was a bug-ridden mess with a lot of incomplete features, some of which wouldn't be finished until 2023 with the 2.0 Update and the release of the Phantom Liberty expansion.
But, the story was there and by god it was amazing. And I didn't care.
Over the intervening years, I started getting interested. I had a coworker recount his experiences with the game to me, including some story beats because at the time I didn't care to play it. I had friends play it. I watched Ghost in the Shell: Standalone Complex. Retook a class at college which reminded me that William Gibson's Neuromancer exists (and I still need to read what is often called the founding work of the cyberpunk genre, despite Blade Runner and its source material by Phillip K. Dick [grr steam censor I'm using it as the last name of an author and not as profane language] predating it by 2 and... many years, respectively). Edgerunners came out in September 2022 and I had friends praising it. And I still didn't care.
I watched Blade Runner, and I loved it.
Then Phantom Liberty dropped, and my friends adored it. And I was interested. At some point in time a friend and I, in partial preparation for him playing through TTW with mods, looked at guns from Cyberpunk 2020. They were kinda cursed. We also listened to all the music performed by Refused under the name Samurai, a punk rock band from the universe which began the rockerboy/girl movement. And it got me into Punk Rock as a whole.
And then the game went on sale in October of 2023 (before the Ultimate Edition released), and I decided to get the 2077+PL bundle.
Now I care. Now I understand. Now I've seen Edgerunners and yes, it is a fantastic show. Now I have Who's Ready For Tomorrow stuck in my head on the regular.
Now I intend to join a Cyberpunk 2020 or RED campaign with my discord buddies whenever that starts.
Now, I got the chips and enhancements.
Now, I got the attitude right.
Now, I got the metal beneath my skin.
I'm chippin' in.

Also there's a job you do for Delamain where you recover rogue taxis and one of them is just GLaDOS from Portal. That alone is more than enough for me to recommend the game, on top of the names of a lot of jobs being shared with songs I adore.
The guns are super wacky though. At least amongst the rifles and ""heavy"" weapons (aka LMGs). Not Fallout 4 Assault Rifle levels of wacky, or BSG Viper Tardis-ammo supply levels of wacky, or even Halo CE Assault Rifle magazine-size levels of wacky, but wacky nonetheless.",1704404998,1708214982,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The stability has also been improved greatly, as before the game crashed my pc and I had to reinstall windows but as of the latest version, it has not crashed once.
Now on to the visual aspect, the game is stunning, now I was not able to use all the graphical settings this game has to offer but even then, it was an eye candy. My only gripe would be that there are sometimes some texture compression issues, for example, low resolution mud covering tiles that are in full detail is a bit jaring, but it is something that you notice only on closer inspeciton.
There were some severe frame drops, however I cannot definitively say that it was because of the game or my hardware.

Peaking my interest after the anime released, Cyberpunk 2077 is not just a game, but an immersive experience with a complex narrative, driven by the player's involvement in the world. Night City isn't the most interactive or intuitive city in all of gaming by any means, but the latest updates really bring the world alive. Being able to interact with each of the gangs across the different sections of the city, engaging in high speed chases with the police or gang members. And I have to praise this games for its beauty, this game is absolutely stunning. Driving around Night City after getting every single ending and getting 100% on the base game, I can say with confidence that I still find it entertaining to just watch the beautiful world around you as you cruise around. I have many critiques of the game, especially considering the time I have dedicated to it, specifically in regards to AI behavior, and the lack of in-depth opportunities to explore the buildings in Night City. Some of the quests, specifically 'Pyramid Song,' has been broken since I got the game, and only functions with the proper mods installed. When being driven by one of the NPCs, it is likely that their movement will be stiff, and they will run over citizens without a second thought. V's movement can be kind of strange at times too, and if you want to see how weird it is just look ar your shadow when you are using mantis blades. It is kind of disheartening when the game breaks and you are engaged in the game play, but these bugs are very few and far in between. I would say that other than Pyramid Song, my experience with the game has been nothing but positive. I can't recommend this game more, from emotional stories, to interesting side quests, and most of all, Keanu Reeves following you everywhere you go. I've never felt cooler in a game than when I walk in a room and immediately kill all of the enemies as a netrunner. This game is not perfect, but I would say it is my favorite modern AAA game, and it does not garner the praise it deserves. 

Hope you all enjoyed this game too.

I purposefully ignored playing Cyberpunk and all information regarding it for years till it could get massively fixed up (which the 2.0 update sure did). I went in blind to this game. I watched the anime and loved it I consider it a masterpiece 10/10. I went in with high expectations fitting a game like this. Could run it at 2k at 60FPS on my new gaming PC. I will make it clear that story driven games aren't usually my thing, I prefer gameplay driven over story driven, but on occasion I will enjoy a story driven game like Witcher 3. I also don't fan over many games.

Went with female V on a whim. I think the voice actor nailed it. I went with the corpo lifepath. Hard difficulty. Then melee mantis blades build as soon as I randomly found a ripper doc that sold them because I think that was the first thing that caught my eye about the promotional art of the game. I was a fucking blender by mid game, especially with the Sandevistan which let me casually take out like 6 people at once.

I very much enjoyed the game at first. Exploring and meeting the characters of this world, the early game twists and turns. I loved Johnny as a character and think he carried most of the story on his back, maybe too much because it quickly became all about him. For the most part I thought the story was fine, even if it felt like I experienced it a little choppy due to the strange pacing, traveling far from point A to B or getting into a fight or someone hitting me up to do another quest, on top of days of IRL work in between some sessions.

The more I played the more I realized how jank the gameplay is and dragged it down. At it's worst I compared it to being like Skyrim. There were many times where a fight happened and I was just like ""Oh okay."" then easily killed them by flailing around in the room then did a loop around the room looking at the floor to get their loot (Such a weird system. Why not have auto loot if there is going to be so many fodder enemies?). I did that shit dozens of times to get back to a long ass cutscene that sends me to another long ass cutscene then maybe a jank boss fight.

A few bosses just spawned oblivious allowing me to just instant kill them if I wanted, or standing still or coming out shooting backwards. The worst was 2 bosses that refused to spawn leaving me scratching my head as to what I was supposed to do to finish the quest and restarting and reloading back was the answer. Sometimes the yellow enemies on the street would attack me and when I killed them the police nearby would see this and aggro at like 2 or 3 stars which was annoying cause I was just questing.

Traversing the world was fun, especially with the charge jump and the motorcycle, but at the same time I encountered annoying stuff there as well, like hitting an invisible car and flying off my bike over a wall onto the street below and dying putting me 15 minutes back. Or getting a random enemy car driving me off the road suddenly and into the bay and having to very slowly swim around and find a ladder to climb out.

All these little things added up to be really fucking annoying and broke my immersion several times. Whenever I found myself getting into the story and gameplay some dumb shit would happen to break that.

The graphics are top notch. Some of the best I have ever seen. Voice acting is some of the best I have ever heard. Music was killer too. No complaints there. Those are some of the best parts of the entire game.

The main story is what I played most of, doing some other quests at random while waiting for the next main story contact to call back. Finished the game around level 37. The story was really good, but I don't consider it amazing. Johnny was my favorite part of the game so I did his quest line to become his best friend, which led me to the Path of Glory ending. I loved this ending. I thought it was awesome. V gets purged of Johnny, became a legend of night city, gets to live several months longer, and choose to go out with a bang. That is how I interpret it. We all gotta die someday. That's a fact.

I was massively disappointed upon learning what the DLC Phantom Liberty was. The way it was hyped up I thought it was going to be a Witcher 3: Blood and Wine level expansion. Like a huge expansion of the game. Something V does after the main game somehow. It isn't that at all. I was so let down by learning that I didn't even bother playing it. I didn't give a fuck by that point lol.

The only boss fight that I genuinely loved in the game was Adam Smasher. He was awesome. There was story buildup to him and he lived up to his legend. He was powerful, scary, merciless. Took me a few tries and I was genuinely enjoying fighting this killing machine head to head with my build. Then this stupid shit happened and just filled me with hate. When he entered phase 2 he got himself stuck in the air and I easily killed him after that point. The height of the gameplay felt like it ended on a wet fart. Here is the infamous picture I took of it.
r/cyberpunkgame - My Honest Review After Finishing The Game As A First Time Player

It was also weirdly mind blowing to me to learn that this game doesn't have multiplayer of any type and procedural generated missions or side activities to do with them GTAV style. It feels like this game was made to be that type of place where like 50 players could all be hanging out doing stuff if they wanted, showing off their builds and fashion. Like hanging out with your friends in Night City would be awesome. That would have made me give the game a bonus point for the community interactions.

Gameplay: 1/2 Graphics: 2/2 Music: 2/2 Story 1/2 Fun 1/2.

Completely different game in 2024 to the one we've had from 2020-2023. I would say it is fair to completely dismiss the merit of all reviews before version 2.0 launched in late 2023 due to being mostly outdated.

Seems like a lot of this is playing as a run and gun instead of sneak as intended for the side quests, just my opinion.

Reloading saves has been fine so far just don't do anything you did before that triggered the glitch. 

Still fun but irritating.

I also play with an Xbox control on PC, may cause issues, I am not positive! Hope this helps.",1708147088,1708147850,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Take what they patched up and add in a few modifications over at the nexus and this game is a pretty preem ride choomba.   And thanks to the modding community, it may just be the beginning to this game.

This review will contain heavy spoilers about the ending so please, if you don't want to read that stop now.


On the plus side, this is probably the best game I ever played. The atmosphere, characters, stories, graphics, action, it all comes together to create one big amazing blast of a game. It actually reminded me partially of living in California. The team must have had heavy design advice from people living there or did their research pretty well. I could write pages about all the good things, especially after they got rid of all the bugs. I clocked in 81 hours and still think I will play one of the endings again or look for missed side-quests just to have some closure. Which brings me to the big negative part.

Again, spoiler alert, this is about the endings. For a game of this grandeur I really don't understand why they must have thought long and hard how to give people the most depressing, unsatisfying miserable ending they could have come up with. 

Early in the game it becomes clear the main character is dying. So what is now clearly priority number one. Not dying! All the time the player's quests are some part in some elaborate grand plan how he could potentially avoid his demise. In the normal game with the normal endings however, that will just not happen. The best thing possible is to help everybody who is dear and near to him to escape into some peaceful wilderness to start a new life, which obviously won't be very long for our hero but that is not shown. So there is at least a hypothetical ending where after some miracle happens.

So Phantom Liberty comes out and one of the earliest things the player gets sold on again is, a chance of not dying. Cool so the player fights long and hard, infiltrates parties, makes tough decision who to support and in the end it's again for nothing! Either the player is back to the situation before the storyline departed into the add-on, which means they will probably die, or they won't die .... but...

So now comes the part why I almost want to say I do not recommend this game. The game designers must have thought hey, we have this ending here where the hero does not die but that's actually too nice for the players. We need to add a few plot twists that they feel miserable and know his life is still f**ed up. Ok, number one, take away all friends and lovers. That's not enough... ok take away all his equipment and invent some illness why he never can wear that stuff again which takes away his source of income and lets him be at the mercy of every small punk in the street ... wait actually make that point even clearer by having him beaten up by random strangers so everybody know the rest of his life will be miserable.  I really want to swear heavily in this review but let me just ask, why why why why why? There are also mayor holes in that story as well, it wouldn't have to be that bad but it seems the designers really wanted the player to either die or be as good as dead. 

So there you have it. On one hand the best game I ever played, on the other hand all endings of the original game and the add-on suck needlessly and ruin the whole experience. 

If the designer ever want to repair this without spending too much time on it, do the following: After the showdown in Phantom Liberty but before the player gets the call to get the cure, allow them to meet Hanako at Embers. After having fled with Panam, call them about the cure. Player gets the cure, can fall into coma and not wear implants if you insist on that nonsense but after they could go back to the Nomad tribe and live somewhat happy in the tribe. Minimum extra scenes to code up and finally at least one halfway decent ending.",1708121444,1708121444,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You can't go for more than 20 minutes before seeing an npc clip into each other or a car fall from the sky or some other bug. The game had a few gamebreaking bugs that forced me to either go back an hour in my save file and once the solution was to wait in game for 20 minutes before moving because a quest didnt start.

The gameplay is pretty ok, the melee combat is awful, but the gunplay is serviceable, even though nothing special.

The story isn't very good either and there are only a few characters I cared about at all during my playthrough and in a few parts it felt like I was forced to do a decision I didn't wanna make, but I was forced to do so...

In the year of our Lord twenty hundred and seventy-seven, a wondrous creation emerged from the forge of CD Projekt Red. Aye, it bore the name “Cyberpunk 2077,” and its visage was as varied as the stars in the firmament.

The Protagonist, V, and Their Unfathomable Burden

Thou, as V, didst step forth into the neon-lit labyrinth of Night City. A mercenary, a blade for hire, yet fate didst intertwine thy path with that of a long-departed minstrel—Johnny Silverhand, his name echoing through the ages. Keanu Reeves, clad in mortal flesh, lent voice to this spectral troubadour. His performance, though stiff as an ancient oak, didst anchor our tale.

The Cityscape, Aflame with Possibilities

Behold, Night City! A sprawling metropolis, its sinews woven of circuitry and vice. Within its labyrinthine streets, choices bloomed like wildflowers after a tempest. The central questline, though brief, didst pull thee inexorably, yet 'twas the side quests that whispered secrets in thy ear. Each decision, a thread in the grand tapestry of thy destiny.

Bugs, Like Fleas Upon a Hound

Yet, fair scribe, let us not veil the truth. Bugs, like gnats in summer, plagued this digital realm. CD Projekt Red, in their ceaseless toil, didst release patches—like salves for wounded code—but still, the maladies lingered. The Xbox One and PlayStation 4, frail vessels, groaned under the weight of Night City’s neon burden. Verily, I counsel thee to seek refuge on sturdier platforms.

Verdict, Carved Upon the Stone Tablets of Gaming Lore

And now, the crux of our tale: Is “Cyberpunk 2077” a gem or a tarnished bauble? By the scales of justice, I declare it thus: A unique and splendid RPG, its characters vivid as stained glass, its narrative a mosaic of intrigue. The freedom it grants, akin to a falcon soaring o’er the moors, beckons thee to partake.

So, dear reader, if thou dost seek a realm where neon mingles with the arcane, where cybernetic hearts beat in sync with the pulse of rebellion, venture forth! For “Cyberpunk 2077” awaits, a digital saga etched upon the annals of time.",1708117837,1708118256,True,2,0,0.547325074672698975,0,True,True,False

I am scared of finishing this game and realizing that I will never experience something like this once more. I do not want this game to end, but I am slowly finishing all the gigs, all the missions. Right until there's absolutely nothing left, except for proceeding and seeing the credits roll. 

Absolutely stunning game, so much good writing, so many compelling characters and so much talent put into it. The music, the combat, the story, the environment and landscapes. This game is a true masterpiece in every possible way. 

I want to point out the work that P. T. Adamczyk made with the soundtrack for this game and the Phantom Liberty DLC. This composer is absolutely nuts. The amount of emotion embedded into the sounds of Night City is scary.

I played the TTRPG, CP2020, but this... Thank you, CDPR. You kept true to your word and you emerged victorious.

Cyberpunk 2077 has its shortcomings. Every step of the way, you are reminded of what could have been if not for the cluster fuck in late development. The main storyline is way too short and cut of much significant content. The side jobs are uneven in terms of quality and writing. The various gigs lack substance and get old after a while. The combat can feel weightless at times : shooting a shotgun rarely feels good.

And yet, it only takes one sunrise, one look at your vertiginous surroundings, one song on the radio perfectly timed with some random encounter, one well written quest to fall in love with Night City all over again, to get lost in its vibrant world filled with so many points of interest and cool locations, many of which are hidden at first glance. 

Most importantly, it doesn't take much to grow attached to your V. - whether he is corpo, street kid or nomad -, Jackie, Johnny, Panam, River, Judy and all the rest of these amazing characters. By the time the curtain goes down, they are more to you than pixels on a computer screen ; once the credits start rolling, you are left with the memories of a lifetime.

The only expansion, Phantom Liberty, brings it all to new heights with heartbreaking storylines, beautiful and unique locations.

Now, long story long.... [u](After Phantom Liberty)[/u]

[u]Story:[/u] It is great but [spoiler]do not expect a ""happy"" ending in any case (Happy endings are an obsolete and fictional idea)[/spoiler]. The cut scenes are very well made. If you have played Witcher, then you know or at least have an idea how the story will shape according to your choices. So just a heads up.
[b]Phantom Liberty:[/b] These games teach life lessons so much better than any school or subject and the teachers are the characters and you know what the interesting things is? You can APPLY these lessons in YOUR REAL life! (I mean it)

[u]Gameplay:[/u] Great game-play and mechanics. I have played almost all Grand Theft Auto games, Watch Dogs and all other Open World games too and it does not feels weird or anything like that to get used to the mechanics of this game. On the contrary, it feels better than others and more realistic (to me at least).
[u]Update:[/u] The cyberwares in this game are so fun! Do not underestimate these at any time. Whenever you get the chance, [spoiler]just go to a ripperdoc ASAP and get them installed in your futuristic android body <3[/spoiler]

[u]Exploration:[/u] Night City, huh? Oh boy, it takes time to get the stuff done (Like Side missions, activities, etc.). During the story, it does not seems that big of a deal but once you start to do other aforementioned stuff, you will see what I mean. The side Gigs are [spoiler]good and if you want to immerse in them a bit then it is possible too, the Cyber-psycho stuff is also great to test your one-on-one fighting skills but the NCPD stuff is really repetitive and time consuming (kinda annoying)[/spoiler]
[b]Phantom Liberty:[/b] Boy oh boy, ""Dog Town"" is such a unique and memorable place that you are gonna adore and remember. Everything that you do here which gives you reward (which almost everything does), gives you a worth it reward, in some way & you want to do other stuff apart from the main story too.

[u]Battle/Combat:[/u] It felt really good to fight enemies whether it is with a weapon or your ""futuristic"" hands. The sword combat in this game is so satisfying and makes you feel like a [i]""SAMURAI""[/i]
[b]Phantom Liberty:[/b] Personally in my play-through, I wasn't able to get my hands on ""new"" weapons or mods having new features but the things that I do got my hands on, they were just too good!

[u]Vehicles/Handling: [/u]Driving is very good in this game and the vehicles are just so well designed and feels like real as if they really exist in real life.

[u]OSTs: [/u] Really good with exceptions of a handful: These handful are just ""Boom babyyy""! Loved them.

[u]Dialogues/Conversations/Relations:[/u] Like I already mentioned in the [b]Story[/b] section above, the conversations really will immerse you in even for the side missions! The accent of dialogues is really well done too. Now comes the complicated part in human history; RELATIONSHIPS. So, relations in this game are [spoiler]well done and depends how you choose to proceed with them. And, don't worry about getting intimate with the character who you feel like she/he is for me....this game doesn't disappoints here neither ;)[/spoiler]
[b]Phantom Liberty:[/b] Just one thing, CHOOSE YOUR WORDS WISELY or else...

[u]MVP:[/u] [spoiler]SAMURAI. Rockerboy. Kerry Eurodine's best buddy. Alt Cunningham's lover. Rogue Amendez's wanna be BF. Wants to SMASH Adam Smasher. Johnny SIlverhand. Love you Johnny!!!! Thank you for such a memorable and awesome experience of my life. i will cherish this game due to Johnny being in this game too. My Nostalgia 15 years from now. [b]Keanu Reeves[/b], Thank You![/spoiler]

[i][b]Note:[/b] [strike]I haven't played the Expansion: Phantom Liberty, yet. I will edit this review after playing through that too.[/i][/strike]
[b]Phantom Liberty:[/b] Played and Completed

[u]Conclusion[/u]: I enjoyed every single aspect of this game. Can't think of anything that annoyed me. Also, I have read through the tough times that CD PROJEKT RED went through for this game and boy oh boy, I never expected that this game will come this far! Overall experience was [b]Awesome[/b]! Adios to the every single individual who contributed in the making of this game directly or indirectly. Many many congratulations to CD PROJECT RED for this milestone and wishing you best of luck for your future plans.

[i]So much work has been put for making the assets of the game too: Like Music, OST, soundtracks, vehicle designs, weapon designs, not to mention the Advertisement posters adn commercials too, etc. Hats off to the team for making this game as real and immersive as possible in today's day 'n age.[/i]

UPDATE:

Alright, I decided to revisit this game after the 2.0 release and finally finish the story. Lol. I got busy with other games. 

What I thought was a solid game at launch was proven to be a concept piece, as the new updates changed everything for the better. I really enjoyed the rework of skill trees and progressions.

It's the most fun I've had with a storyline since I was a teenager.

This game is utterly brilliant. There aren't too many bugs left, compared to a game like Skyrim it's practically bug free. The combat feels amazing, the story is fantastic, Night City is absolutely brilliant.

This is a must have and at 50% it's a steal. I'll be buying every single DLC for this game as they're released once I finish the main campaign (I've put it on hold to finish every single side mission I can find before completing the story).

The story line is really interesting and one of the missions is actually very sad and anyone who has played it knows what i'm on about. I wish that missions could have different endings. The weapons are great and there is plenty to choose from. The map is actually very big, I thought it would be smaller. The atmosphere is absolutely amazing and makes you feel apart of the game.

I've played this four years after its release so i havent met many bug. I had two or three crash to desktop in my 35 hours.

Performance is okayish if you have RTX card and a decent CPU. DLSS give a big boost to performance. But still downtown areas are took away 20-30 fps.

Keanu Reeves is suprisingly okay in Silverhand role. I didn't liked at first that he was casted cause he don't give any rockstar vibe, but as a bitter manipulative sociopath he is very convincing.

Animation, soundwork, colours, the mood of the game is all top notch. It shows that many people worked passionetly for years on this game. I followed its developement since 2016 or 7 when they put out that little cinematic about the max tac cyberpsycho chick.

As for how cyberpunk as the original is realised here i think its pretty spot on. They even bring you back to the original settings from 2020, and it feels excactly like the tabletop rpg.

The developers have managed to put together one hell of a city, running on one hell of a graphics engine. It looks good on most system configurations, but given the top of the line it really outdoes itself. It's a feast for the eyes and at least one main reason to go through it all.

The city is also one very nice playground for your amateur climber and parkour fan. Especially with the right leg cyberware and the ability to dash and air-dash. That alone has made exploring the city a lot of fun, trying to get to the weirdest places.

Immersion is also at its peak while playing, and the setting just oozes style. It also has one of the coolest mechanics for narrative exploration, via the braindance mechanic. It's somewhat similar to what Rocksteady's Batman game did, for the investigations, but a lot cooler. I really hope they choose to and manage to expand this into something even more full-fledged in the sequel.

In terms of gameplay, it's a considerable improvement over Witcher 3, especially in terms of possible ways of getting through combat encounters. And I was surprised and chose to get through most of it in a full stealth build, and only later, after maxing that out, chose to also expand into a netrunner build. A veritable wizard of the cyberpunk setting. I will want to try a pure melee build sometime in the future, but I do worry about the lack of quickhacks, as versatile and impactful as they are.

The overall story is good, with some nice plot points along the way, both in the main and in the Phantom Liberty expansion, but especially the endings of each of them. They just ooze high production value. Also in the narrative department, while it has plenty of side content, via gigs and jobs, and a few of them do have sizable narrative arcs, spanning multiple missions, I have to say that most of them are fairly forgettable or serviceable. Somehow in this department it feels like they fell short of Witcher 3's optional content, that you could easily mistake for main content. I do hope I don't just have rose-tinted glasses, but I suspect I do not. 

Another issue with the side content, and this is due to the setting in general (and this is definitely more of a personal issue) is that the whole setting feels more like GTA, with plenty of satire, than Blade Runner. And I would've loved it if it were more of the latter than the former. There's also a dissonance between the two visions, both of which are present in CP2077 but they clash with each other; where one tries to take it self seriously and give a philosophical outlook on this type of dystopian future of mankind, while the other is just crass and unsubtle and disarms that critique from being taken seriously by the person experiencing it.

Another negative is the itemization, balancing and economy overall. In terms of itemization and economy it's still pretty poor and unremarkable. Money still has no value since you can easily exploit it. Having done a 100% run, and having completed all the side content before tackling the main stuff, for a good 1/3rd of the game I had maxed out everything on my character in terms of leveling and haven't changed my gear for that time at all. With the latest patch they also made everything scale to the player's level, so there is a constant difficulty curve generally speaking, which makes all enemies feel pretty much the same. Except for the 0.1% of encounters which can have incredible and sometimes impossible difficulty spikes. I could not, even after a lot of attempts, overcome the Adam Smasher fight on the hardest, Very Hard, difficulty. All of this indicates that there's not a lot of balancing by hand done in the game, and CDPR just threw up its hands and resorted to an auto-scaling difficulty, which results in mostly unremarkable combat encounters. Luckily the skill and cyberware systems have been overhauled in the 2.0 patch, giving considerably more options. Too bad they couldn't also balancing the whole experience by hand, to ensure a certain player difficulty curve.

But even with all of these significant negatives, overall the game is an absolute joy to experience. The quality of the main story and content, and the effort that was put into realizing Night City as probably the best dystopian cities in gaming; all of these manage to overcome the negatives, especially if you do not dilute the whole experience by delving too much into the side content. I unfortunately went for a completionist run, and did experience a lot of the negatives, but I hope they manage to improve on these in the sequel

To wrap things up, I'd like to mention the soundtrack which is also pretty fantastic, with plenty of amazing moody pieces, combat themes and everything inbetween. I did not care very much for the radio stations, but that's just me. I generally prefer to ride my bike across the cityscape with the radio off, just taking in the mood of the city. And it is a grand city indeed. Probably one of the best city settings in any game. And I do wonder how they'll try to improve on it in the sequel.

All in all, I'd have to give it an 9/10. And a definite recommendation.",1708023987,1708069252,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It's got very little role-play in it. The clothing selection alone is woeful. There's not much to do, other than cruise around and either cause chaos until Maxxtac come and end you, or just do the missions.

The missions are good, except for the forced stealth ones imo. The car combat kinda sucks. The car handling/driving is hot trash.

The beauty is turning yourself into a super saiyan cyborg. But you don't have to worry about cyberpsychosis, and as said before the clothing options are trash.

It's also not as dark as I feel it should be. It's dark, but still feels like it is a game made for teens.

And the stealth censorship patches are infuriating.

i cannot recommend this game enough, truly a special game you cannot miss as a gamer. easily my top 3 gaming experiances of all time, if not number 1.  ",1607647125,1708063382,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Now? It's a completely different game.  Still SOME glitches, but much more stable.  The game is deeper than ever, especially with the crafting and side quests.

This game was good, even with the issues before.  Now it's amazing.  

I'd recommend it 100%

This game is better opts and playable now even im using 3050 with medium settings its stays at 120 fps. which is very nice.

I've started play at patch 2.0 and actually missed the experience back before this patch update. Some veterans says its more fun before because some of the contents ( ex, Equipping Johnny Silverhand's hand arm can be equipped and it looks awesome. Which is sad its removed and considered gltich back then and causes crashes.) And well some of the looter experience which is level and gear armor values based and random slottabke mods. Which they remove the stats at some of the clothes we found in NC. It's fine tho considering we just focused on fashion hunting which is why i also wanted to play this game now. Anyways about Johnny Silverhand u can get it why all experienced Cyberpunk player love this character and u will see it once u play. U will have a great fond of memories and will understand why he is the one of the main attraction of the game (well if u do want to have good relationship with him and not being a prick, altho he is also a douchebag. Anyway u'll see why :D).

I've just finished my first playthru which unlocks the devil ending. Its kinda well unique experience. So well written for the story. Not every game gave this kind of exp and immersive as Cyberpunk 2077 does. Anyway even if u messed up at the first playthru dont worry coz it will go straight to ur last checkpoint before ur startting last jobs for ur related ending. Then u can finish whatever u wanted to do and pick another job or specific things that can lead to diff ending from ur first playthru or u can just start another new game.

Try different lifestyle also matters when it comes to dialogue choices during ur playtru so u better get ready for it. But streetkid by far imo the best dialogue choices out of three lifestyles. Just enjoy whatever u comes in ur mind at first starting the game., Already so much guide for this game for almost every aspect of the game that leads to achieve specific things or achievements. So dont worry.

I know from my first playthru im going to continue it further, besides. Still have a city to burn. ;P,",1708060266,1708060266,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Cyberpunk was a glitchy disaster that barely even functioned on old gen consoles, to the point of being pulled from the Playstation store entirely.
With that being said, Cyberpunk 2077 right now Is an incredible Game that will surely remain In my top of all time list.
It's honestly shocking how good this game looks. Not just in pure graphical fidelity, but In the details and density of the world. Every little spot In Cyberpunk feels lived In, and that's a true accomplishment.

It's also Important that you understand what Cyberpunk 2077 Is, because It's not exactly advertised properly In my opinion.
This game Is not some huge sprawling RPG with countless builds and monumental story altering choices that many of the trailers would have you believe.
Builds are absolutely a thing and there are story altering choices to be made, but at the end of the day, Cyberpunk 2077 Is an Action game first, and RPG second. 
This however Is not a bad thing.
One of the biggest strengths of Cyberpunk Is the high quality bar for the Main Quest and the Side Missions.
Often times, these feel totally indistinguishable. 
Side Missions never really feel ""Side Mission-y"".
Some Side Missions have whole storylines with multiple endings even.

The last point to touch upon Is the Superb Writing, mainly between V and Johnny Silverhand.
V and Johnny are what make Cyberpunk 2077 special.
Getting into this would require a heavy delve Into Spoilers, so I will leave It here and just hit you with a hardcore Recommendation from me.",1708059147,1708059166,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Yes, it is awfully a lot of hours for a single player game, but oh my the beauty of the story, the lore and the redemption this game got is just breathtaking. The story was amazing, actually one of the best stories ive had the wonderfull joy and privledge to play, and this is for a lifetime that im talking about,

Many would argue that the game was in such a terrible state at launch, yes it is true but for PC players the game was quite playable with some bugs coming along, but since launch the game has come such a long way and with the expansion ""Phantom liberty"" it has only become a masterpiece made by CDred which im sure left many of us just wanting more and more. 

Amazing story telling, amazing choice of dialouges and exploration that just blew my mind. And for all my fellow PC players i will say that with the help and power of mods you can only make the game better from here, 
Gameplay wise i will say that the feeling of driving and getting into combat situations as well as just simply exploring has such a smooth and fun way to do it. Combat can be fun and there is many builds to play with diffrent types of weapons, style that fit the way you want to play. This is me talking, who is on his 5th playthrough now playing as a ""ninja netrunner""

The game does still need more things, such as better customisation, housing, gameplay and etc etc. But im hoping that it will all be there when the sequel of cyberpunk comes out. 

But for those wondering, it is worth every single penny that you spend. 

As for me, i keep wanting to return to the game when im playing other games lol.

After completing the main story twice & Phantom Liberty once (v1.61 to v1.7, then v2.0 - v2.11 on the 2nd playthrough) completing all the Gigs, Side jobs unlocking all but 3 of the potential endings (all tied to Phantom Liberty) along the way, I can honestly say that Cyberpunk 2077 is the best game I've ever played!

It's storytelling & characters are very brilliantly written by the team at CDPR, you'll grow to love, hate, laugh & even feel their moments of grief, I've not been so engrossed or felt so immersed into a game's plot, storytelling, it's characters & chain of events leading to the multiple endings which even then branch off to 1 or 2 epilogues from the (now since Phantom Liberty's release) 7 possible endings Cyberpunk 2077 has to offer since playing Fallout New Vegas or jumping back further Metal Gear Solid. Some of the endings in this game really did ""hit it where it hurts"" & left me thinking ""I should have done this"" or actually regretting the decisions made to get to that particular ending.

[h3] CYBERPUNK 2077 [/h3]

Presentation wise, this game is absolutely beautiful, it looks incredible, it sounds fantastic & it also runs very smoothly. It's easy to control (I use a control pad for my PC rather then a Keyboard/Mouse), the key bindings for those using a controller over a keyboard & mouse are mapped out brilliantly so I didn't need to tweak any settings to ""meet my preference"". The amount of customisation this game does offer you from Controls, HUD display, Visual Effects, Depth of detail to ease performance, even going as far as having the choice to optimise the colour layout for those who are colourblind is amazing!

There's a huge variety of weapons, cars, bikes & abilities gifted through Cyberware on offer, from the basic to the unbelievably powerful to the down right hilarious. Main Missions & Side Missions have a lot of depth & length to them & alongside that, being a Merc for hire, you have the option to work for Fixers around different districts of Night City in some very interesting & extremely varied Gigs which reward you handsomely if all are completed. You can assist the NCPD in resolving various criminal activities gain much needed Street Credit (for unlocking better Weapons/Mods/Cyberware), cash as well as extra experience & practice with combat to help you into the Gigs & Side missions a bit more prepared.

Issues I had before V2.0 (basically things that felt underwhelming or frustrating mostly to do with progression etc, not faults with the game that were being fixed) mostly revolved around how Clothing contributed to armour, Cyberware was 2nd nature & crafting & getting to specific perks was an absolute grind at times. It was really, unintentionally more complicated then it needed to be. But all of that changed with 2.0 & the improvements have literally been game changing:
- The crafting system is more simplified & faster.
- Cyberware is now a massive priority for Skills, Passive bonuses & giving you Armour
- Weapon mods & upgrading are overhauled.
- The Perk System makes any perk chosen feels it has it's always useful
- Bike Handling & Driving in general feels a lot more smoother
- Clothes are just cosmetic (but can still be sold or broken down for crafting materials)
- Combat & Boss Fights are a lot harder
- With Phantom Liberty, vehicle combat was added

There is a lot more pre-planning & experimentation on offer, your core skills upgrade as you play giving you perk points to spend every 2 levels they increase & bonuses to the perks they are attributed to in between, for example the ""Net-runner"" skill is upgraded using Smart Targeting weapons, Hacking targets or objects such as cars, cameras, turrets or explosives or it can be increased from Intelligence based skill checks unlocking certain doors. Being able to freely refund spent Perk Points helps you pick & choose whats best for the build you want & just makes trying out every potential option even more fun & gives you limitless freedom to re-spec your character without having to restart the whole game again.

[h2] THANK YOU CDPR [/h2]

The team behind this have done an unbelievable job in keeping this game ""up to standards"" after it's seemingly broken launch in 2020 (I bought this game in 2022, knowing nothing about it's launch or the game itself). The dedication that CDPR has shown to not only resolve all flaws but to then totally overhaul the game's mechanics for Version 2.0 (Phantom Liberty) on-wards is dedication that doesn't come often, especially in the modern gaming industry, where money seems to be the only priority & customer satisfaction is at the bottom of their list of priorities. Any technical faults I've had with the game, such as unreported bugs, the team at CDPR actually bothered to contact me after these issues were reported, to learn more about what was going wrong & then contact me again once the issues were addressed in the next patches to check everything was resolved, just showing how much they actually cared about customer satisfaction. And even now, it annoys me that most just ""expect more"" & show little gratitude to how much time, effort & money has gone into this game since it's launch in 2020.

We're now on to Version 2.11 & coming to the end of patches or major updates as CDPR moves on to The Witcher 4 & Cyberpunk Orion and apart from a bug in Phantom Liberty which disabled the protagonist's phone until restarting the game (instead of just until the mission I was on was finished), there has been no problems with Cyberpunk's stability, visuals or performance.",1692400711,1708031781,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There's a bug that makes you laugh every 8 minutes. So many animations look like a ride at Universal Studios. Cutscenes look great though. Now that the engine has been patched for over a year it's pretty decent. 40-70 fps everything ultra no raytracing on 2080ti with DLSS on. You won't see many games with this level of detail. 

One thing this game excels at is the environmental detail. I can't even say atmosphere because the simple NPCs take you out of it with their repeated actions. 

Main story is good so far. Side quests even better. Me and keanu r friends. Side quests pretty good. Wish there was mini games. 

MUSIC IS TERRIBLE EXCEPT THE COOL JAZZ RADIO STATION ROYAL BLUE HELL YA. I HATE THE MENU SOUNDS. WHY DIDN'T THEY JUST BUY POPULAR NEW RETRO WAVE SONGS LIKE THEY DID FOR THE TRAILER?

All things considered it's def worth a play and it's a big game with lots of layers like it should be and I can't stop playing!

Original Post
This is one of my favorite games of all times. I love the story, setting, choices, exploration, variety of tactics, open world, graphics, and especially the sound track. All of the minor little details create an environment that is very immersive and bring the game world to life. I only started playing in 2023 with version 1.61. In 150 hours of completing the 4 main endings (not the secret), and all available side missions/NCPD scanner missions, I only experienced 2-3 crashes. However there are still a lot of minor bugs that I found annoying from time to time. The 1.62 patch seemed to fix some of the graphics bugs (NPCs and cars disappearing in parts especially) but introduced so many more that sometimes it feels like ""death by a thousand paper cuts"". Still, this did not prevent me from playing through it a 2nd time with a very different character build of V.",1684675792,1708029439,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm not going to talk about pre-2.0, there's enough out there already, and i experienced all of it. 
I applaud CDPR for their creation, vision and persistence. 

I've played many a hyped game that on release, turned out to be hot garbage; Kreed, Stormrise (remember WhipSelect?), SotS2, and Starfield to give a broad range of examples over my decades of gaming. 

The thing about CP2077 is that they fixed it, and boy did they fix it! Right outta the park, you could say.
Game runs better, almost all bugs are gone (they cut out the T-posing Jackie bit from the first cut-scene, i approve!) and what we have now is the game it was meant to be.

Add to that, the additional Phantom Liberty content and we are right back on track! Great story so far, loving the new perks and gear, mods, the lot! - Muammar is now one of my fav fixers! 

Also Idris Elba! You should buy the game just for his performance!
(man, how I miss The Wire)!

CBP is (now) the game i always wanted it to be; after watching Edgerunners on Netflix i can now actually 'live' in night city, spending hours running gigs or just f-ing about GTA style - remember, when you wanted to play the game but couldn't be bothered to actually DO anything, you just made your own fun and would run into something random but totally epic, or do some mad antics after accruing max Wanted stars, and somehow manage to evade the law!?

Firstly, it's a shooter, not a slasher. Personally, I find it as a good shooter myself. It was fun shooting at things here, although, I was usually using like 2 guns (a submachine gun for rapid fire and a gun with a silencer for more precision and stealth and I changed the exact models only a couple of times). With a perk from Phantom Liberty, which started highlighting vulnerable areas it became even more satisfying. My only complain is that NPCs practically never threw grenades at me, which prevented me from getting 2 related achievements. I think I saw a grenade from NPCs maybe once. Don't know if I was just too efficient killing them or it was a bug, but this felt strange to me.

Secondly, I think open world here is even less interesting. This is partially because I prefer ""middle ages"" to ""modern"" or even ""futuristic"" setting. But partially because side quests are... Mostly forgettable. I am not talking about NCPD hustles, but about gigs and actual side quests. There are some good ones or, at least, those, that do have good moments, but for the most part they feel like fillers and have little to no visual impact on the world of the game. They can be fun even without that, of course, but overall nothing special. And I think the best ones were ""spy"" missions, where you needed to investigate things, and depending on what you've found (or not), whom you talked to or not, results changed. I think Witcher 3 had way more truly interesting side quests.

But I think the main point of attraction here is the main story and Phantom Liberty. Main game's story does have side quest lines, which are engaging, too, but they are nothing compared to the main plotline and Phantom Liberty. Those truly immerse you in the story. You are not a talking head talking to other talking heads: all cinematics are done from your first person perspective and you do feel in the action, and it is good. If you watch it as a movie - you probably will still enjoy it.

Choices are still mostly flavor, though. There are certainly some, that do change the available endings or particular details in those endings, but for most part it's pure role playing without real consequences. But the endings... Those... They differ a lot. Neither is perfect, in my opinion, there were little things, that irked me, but each one of them stirred either deep emotions in me or made me think. Not just about the world, but about my own life.

And this is great. There are too few games with stories like this. You can see real progression for Johnny and V. Something that felt clear-cut in the begging truly becomes muddled by the end of the game and making certain decisions does become harder. Surprisingly, what most would consider ""bad"" choices do lead to somewhat better endings. They are bitter, but they do feel... Real, I guess?

This is, actually, another good thing about the game: it feels real. Yes, some things are futuristic here, since it's the future, and some are exaggerated and overly pessimistic, since cyberpunk genre implies that, but there are lots of things, which are relevant to us now. It makes you ask yourself things. For example, do you really want a world where you can feel this level of loneliness tearing you up, making you insane just because you want to survive?

If this does not make it a good story, I don't what does. And with a fun gunplay, and some interesting mechanics related to cyberware - it is really a good game. Even if the original release was really bad. But that's also a lesson: if you care to put in time and effort - you can build a good thing, which will be remembered.",1707984016,1707984016,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is overall good now compared to before, but some of the problems that were in the game when it first released are still present.
Here are issues that are still within the game:
-lethal vs non-lethal combat as a game mechanic is still half-baked. The developers clearly wanted to do more with this feature but for one reason or another didn't fully flesh out this mechanic.
-inventory management is still somewhat cumbersome
-the cyberpunk genre as a whole has some themes/motifs that are severely outdated. Japan and China are real countries people, we don't need to wildly speculate on how they operate.

Here are major improvements made since the launching of the game:
++The Phantom Liberty DLC has a great main quest and the actors for each character are top notch. Even the side quests/gigs provide great vignettes for life in Night City.
+overhaul of the talent/perks system has made gameplay more fun
+car handling has improved
+transmogrification
+crafting system overhaul
+more properties are available for purchase",1624858312,1707953245,True,0,0,0.527100205421447754,0,True,False,False

When it came out my uncle bought it and I was DYING to get it as well, but he told me not to since it was extremely buggy.
I was sad, however It slipped my mind for the next couple of years until recently when the 2.0 update came out. People were praising it and saying that it had finally be what they hoped for when it was first announced. It took this as my signal to finally try out to game, and to my pleasant surprise, it was more than I had hoped for.
City setting had always been overwhelming to me coming from small towns, but even with the huge buildings it doesn't feel like it's going to topple down and crush me. 
Though my problem with the setting is that non-important NPCs (meaning not involved in the story) get no depth, and sometimes the same character models are used over and over. 
With the level of graphics I completely understand the character model thing, but having some sort of interaction would be much preferred.

My Rating: 100/100

Story: 11/10 The story of Cyberpunk 2077 is one of the best story's I've ever played

Gameplay: 10/10

Difficulty: You have to learn the handling of the weapons but the difficulty is not to easy but not to difficult.
(based on normal difficulty)

Graphics: 10/10 (My graphic points are based on the graphic and what year the game was released. So for example if the game is from 2010 and the graphics are good for 2010, it's a 10/10.)

Sounddesign / Music: 11/10 (The music is incredibly awesome.)

Duration: One Story Run with a few side quests and a few moments just enjoying Night City: 35h - 45h

Replayability: Yes because there are different endings and different ways to complete some missions.

Price: Game: 59,99 (Absolutely Worth it), 

Additional comments:
I haven't played the Phantom Liberty dlc yet, but its on my list.
Cyberpunk ist now playable with very few bugs and almost no crashes, and its really fun to play. Overall it's a really great game and i enjoyed playing throug the story a lot. I really like the idea of having a shooter but but depending on your choices, some situations in missions can be different.
Playing this game with mods is also a lot of fun and can add a few more hours.",1700592574,1707945072,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-City design, buildings, ads do a good job of recreating the feel of cyberpunk as a genre
-Lots of options for how you want to approach challenges
The Bad:
-Most missions are 70-80% sitting there while people talk at you, with very little choice in how you want the dialogue to go.  Many conversations happen while you are literally in the passenger seat as an NPC drives you somewhere.  It's like a masterclass in taking control away so you feel less like a player and more like a viewer. 
 The actual gameplay parts of missions where you sneak or hack or fight your way through levels is so short it feels like an afterthought.
-On top of the above, story pacing is glacially slow.  The opening action setpiece that actually gets you invested in your character and the world happens after ~6 hours of tutorials and filler missions.  And this pace doesn't let up, I frequently put the game down and came back weeks later because it feels like there is just too much filler in between the meat of the game.
-Extremely backwards tutorial system has entire missions to teach you obvious things like to sneak by going when guards aren't looking, but almost no useful information about how to manage less intuitive systems like attribute points and crafting materials.",1707942520,1707942520,False,2,0,0.511879861354827881,0,True,False,False

After playing through this game and its DLC, I've got to say, it was a mixed experience for me. Despite my usual reservations about cyberpunk themes, I could see the effort CD Projekt Red invested in the main story. They might not have gone all in, but the dedication and hard work are undeniable.

On the positive side, the game's graphics were a high point, offering a visually stunning experience that fully immerses you in its world. The ability to customize your character is another aspect I appreciated, allowing for a personal touch in the cyberpunk universe. However, I felt the customization options were somewhat limited and could have benefited from further expansion.

One of the game's delights was discovering Easter eggs and the inclusion of real-world celebrities, which added a layer of excitement and connection to our reality. The battle mechanics and the diverse array of skills available for characters to learn added depth to gameplay, enhancing the overall experience with strategic elements that kept engagements feeling fresh and varied.

On the other hand, the main storyline and its various endings did not captivate me. I found them to be lackluster and devoid of the uniqueness or intrigue I had hoped for. Night City, despite its initial allure, quickly became monotonous. The repetitive nature of the missions and the sameness of the locations contributed to a sense of tedium that overshadowed my explorations.

Moreover, the characters, particularly those available for romantic relationships, were a disappointment. They failed to provide the emotional depth and support that would have enriched the protagonist's journey, leaving a gap in the narrative engagement.

In conclusion, while there were elements of the game I genuinely enjoyed, my overall experience was dampened by a storyline and character interactions that failed to capture my interest. This sentiment is likely amplified by my general apathy towards the cyberpunk genre. However, my frustration peaked with a technical issue that prevented me from achieving the final game achievement. Despite having completed all other achievements, a glitch that blocked actions necessary for progressing and accessing the last achievement left me unable to complete my goal, adding a sour note to my concluding hours with the game.

Shifting focus to the DLC, it's as if we're discussing a completely different game. The narrative within the DLC captured my attention and admiration. What stood out to me was the impactful decision-making, where choosing between two paths led to genuinely heartfelt consequences. Unlike the main storyline, the endings here were far from predictable or mundane. They were thought-provoking and engaging, showcasing a refreshing depth that was absent from the original campaign.

The variability and uniqueness of the characters within the DLC were remarkable. Each character brought a distinct flavor to the story, enriching the experience with their individuality and compelling backstories. This diversity in character design added layers to the narrative, making the world feel more alive and complex.

Moreover, the way the DLC's story unfolded based on the choices I made was impressive. The different trajectories that events could take depending on my decisions added a significant replay value and made my choices feel impactful and meaningful.

As the DLC drew to a close and the credits began to roll, the combination of the emotive music and beautifully animated summary of the DLC's story moved me profoundly. It was a rare moment where a game elicited such a strong emotional response, to the point where I found myself moved to tears. This emotional resonance was a testament to the exceptional storytelling and artistic execution of the DLC, setting it apart from my experiences with the main game.",1707926410,1707926410,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Filled with corpo greed, love interests, and a plethora of ways to navigate the world. I would say there are multiple options for every encounter and each side quest doesn't feel like it takes you away from the main story. Instead it fleshes out the world of Night City, and adds to your love of the space you occupy in this megalopolis.

Choice even effects your combat as you can by a sword wielding cyberninja or a gunslinger or a silent agent throughout the whole game. It gives you the option of being as lethal or non-lethal as you want, and some missions are enhanced by not killing your enemy. Not to mention this game has 4 different endings that I know of. Unlike some games (ME3) which emphasize choice and in the end makes that choice seem meaningless by having the same ending in different flavors, this game actually allows you to play through an epilogue. Each one vastly different, and that continues to immerse you into the world.

I also am a huge Deus Ex fan, and as I mentioned previously, and this fills that void. The different conspiracies that fill the city like veins in a body are so embedded and are so interesting to learn about. Some quests will let you wander around after in a daze of ""What just happened"" in a good way. It just keeps having you craving more and there are lots of articles and emails to read that flesh out these different plotlines. I'd suggest no skipping anything. As each little item adds to the world that you're living in. Speaking of living you can have a variety of places to live, and each one is equipped with a room that you can flesh out with legendary weapons that can mount upon your walls. So I suggest not skipping through anything, in this living breathing world!

The graphics are amazing though the filter that is the stylistic overlay for the entire game can sometimes make it feel like its running slower than it is. Otherwise it really feels amazing to be able to run anywhere in this city. To experience things that don't even tie into the missions in anyway and are just fun as far as immersion. I can't imagine what this game would be like in VR. I can only assume it would be amazing.

I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the voice acting! Especially lady V's voice and her sidekick Jackie! Jackie is hilarious and I suggest you fall for his antics and make him your favorite side character in the while game.

In the end I can't recommend enough taking a dive into night city and experiencing these city streets for yourself.",1707925749,1707925749,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Update 2.0 offered me about 20 frames per second worth of performance by utterly GUTTING the graphical fidelity of the game without any means of disabling the changes (2060 Super). To be frank, the game-play experience is not so fun or compelling that ANY user would choose extra frames per second over graphical fidelity (it's a single player story telling game, after all, and not a competitive shooter.) I used to be able to ""wow"" my friends by sitting them in Night City and letting them run around. Now, the game looks like an upscaled Xbox port. 

Consider skipping the purchase of this game if you're still interested in playing it. Not only will older versions of the game improve your graphical fidelity, but you'll also skip the annoying third-party launcher that you must download in order to launch the game every time.

You would think a game that released three years ago as of this review's posting that we'd no longer have a swarm of bugs, minor and gamebreaking. haha. lol. lmao even. I've only lost a couple hours thanks to employing the ancient canticle of extra save files, and I urge you to do the same. Despite this, it's... it's a great game. It really is now, despite itself.

The perktree overhaul, netrunning a la Watchdogs but better, a whole litany of awesome weapons generic and unique, and some pretty cool cosmetics - the latter being only valuable to those who use the photo editor to pretend they're good at taking pictures, like me. Also, obviously the graphics are downright gorgeous, this game possesses some of the most beautifully crafted visuals of the current age. Hell, even the face animations look nice.

The writing is like a rusty rollercoaster: it's got the sickest loops and scream-inducing highs, coupled with some really odd curves that cause permanent whiplash. The consequences of rewriting the game to better place Keanu Silverhand in the game are noticeable, and for the most part the rewrite does its job well - helps that Johnny Reaverhand is so well written too - but in the case of the [spoiler]Voodoo Boys[/spoiler] questline, or the latter half of [spoiler] Judy's [/spoiler] questline, you'll see some readily apparent cracks. 
But even then, it's a credit to the game's portrayal of the lore of Cyberpunk that the former is a notable discrepancy from how it ought to be.

Still. It's a great story, from beginning to end, and a bombastic good journey along the way. Despite it's many problems, I ultimately do recommend this game for most people looking to appreciate a gritty cyberpunk world or a damn good RPG.",1707920894,1707920977,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Tried every fix imaginable, it still crashes on startup, until one time it randomly doesnt. Launching the game through the .exe so it ignores their annoying shitty pre-launcher seems to increase the chances of not crashing, but even then you'll still only be able to boot the game up 1/100 attempts.
So yea, the game is technically playable, if you are willing to do an hour long chore of starting it over and over until it decides to work (or not).
Its like every third patch they push out breaks the game for half the playerbase, before they unfuck it in the next patch. That is a problem as i paid for the damn thing and i'll play it when i want, not when the devs graciously decide to fix what they previously broke.
This is as of patch 2.11, maybe in the next one it will work for me and not for you? Maybe it still wont work for either of us, or maybe it will brick your OS. Who knows, i sure as shit don't.

Released as a buggy mess and ended up as easily one of the best RPGs ever
Night City is a character in itself. the beautiful yet haunting lights, the buildings and the whole atmosphere brings out the dystopian vibe and makes it alive.
Keanu Reeves is one of the best things about the game, his persona and his character takes the story to another level. All of the characters give different aspects and parts of this dystopian world.
The combat, the mechanics and the variety they added later was a gamechanger and it opened up a ton of fun playstyles and badass ways to chop up corpo rats.
The game is visually gorgeous and sounds even better as it includes some of the hardest tracks in gaming.

I picked the hardest difficulty because YOLO! The hardest difficulty is too easy. I can only imagine how easy it would be on the other easier settings.  
  
There was one part of the main questline and I had to escape a skyscraper by going into the parking garage to get picked up by an AI taxi cab. Guys with guns were waiting for me... 

I just I was running back and forth playing hide-and-seek with a group of 6 bad guys, peeking my head around the corner to do a bunch of cyber attacks, running around to the other side of the pillar, doing cyber attacks over there, running back to the first side, cyber attacks, run back to the other side, cyber attacks, run to the other side again... This was the only fight I've experienced where it was actually difficult on the hardest difficulty setting and that's because if I tried to fight with a gun I'd do barely any damage (like 4 damage) and if they hit me, they took like 80% of my health with each bullet they hit me with. 

It took me like 30 minutes to do that single fight. It was cheesy, imo. Playing hide and seek for 30 minutes is not what I'd expect from a ""hard mode"" option. The boss that I fought 30 seconds before reaching the garage died in like 3 minutes or less, so WTF?????????

It turned out I had not used any of my skill points at all, so I was unknowingly handicapped??? Anyway, I've beefed up my guns and skills so now everything is kind of easy again. Almost too easy. The only time I die is when I'm trying to joke around and do something dumb, like accidentally stand on my own grenade.  
  
I can understand the desire to play on easy as the storyline is awesome as hell, but I highly recommend playing only on the hardest because if it's any easier than this... geez.",1707892079,1707892079,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Despite its highly anticipated release, the game has garnered mixed reviews due to a plethora of technical issues and gameplay shortcomings.

Visuals & Atmosphere: Night City is a breathtaking marvel, pulsating with life, neon lights, and a gritty cyberpunk aesthetic. The visuals are stunning, immersing players in a vibrant, yet sinister, urban landscape.

Story & Characters: The narrative weaves a complex web of intrigue, betrayal, and personal struggle, offering branching storylines and meaningful choices. The characters are well-written and memorable, each with their own motivations and agendas.

Gameplay: Cyberpunk 2077 offers a mix of first-person shooting, hacking, and RPG elements. The gunplay is solid, but the melee combat feels clunky and unpolished. The hacking mechanics add depth to encounters, allowing players to manipulate the environment and enemies.

Technical Issues: Unfortunately, Cyberpunk 2077's launch was marred by numerous bugs, glitches, and performance issues across all platforms. While some have been addressed through patches, the game still suffers from stability issues and graphical glitches.

Conclusion: Despite its flaws, Cyberpunk 2077 is a captivating journey through a dystopian future filled with intrigue and danger. While it may not live up to the immense hype surrounding its release, it still offers a compelling experience for fans of the cyberpunk genre. With ongoing updates and improvements, the game has the potential to realize its full vision and become a classic in the genre.

This game is absalute... a fresh breath of air.. 
Its incredible.. i dont have a single bad this to say about it apart from there not being an online mode.. 
But i dont even care.. this game is incredible.. i played it for sooo many hours and once i complete other games, im coming back to this one.. 
Sooo many ways you can choose how your story will be, soo many endings and choices, women, boobs (yes, nudity), its truly amazing and im soo happy i tried it, i was a bit worried that id spend £50 on a game i dont like but its worth every penny.. 
Also the graphics! The GRAPHICS! just .... 
Great work developers! 
Probably one of the best if not the best single player game ive ever played..

Into further detail - My only gripe is things like most Gigs and nearly all NCPD Scanner missions get pretty stale. Go to this place, kill these people, done - for like 90% of it.

At least the different gangs in different areas of the city means that the people you kill look different?

Chjeck!) and mixes it all up with a sprinkle of Keanu on top. You'd think that would be the best game ever? Well... it should have been. Much improved since the update, the gameplay is good, just not AS good as any of the above in their own niche. To its credit there are a LOT of progression upgrades, and it's an excellent feature that you can refund all your upgrades whenever you want and reinvent your character class. There's also way more granularity than Deus Ex in how you can upgrade your cybernetics, and a similar nuance to Dying Light in the weapon variety and upgrades. You get a lot for your money here. But nothing feels entirely NEW. My biggest gripe is with the story, which takes a while to get going, and didn't grab me at all at first. Unlike Deus Ex, whose story kept me replaying dozens of time - this one just doesn't have the hooks or atmosphere to merit even a single rerun. 25 hours in now, I am mildly hooked, but I am still not entirely sure what's going on. I am more interested in my character progression, and how to weaponise the new car I've bought. The world you inhabit is HUGE by the way - I doubt I will ever see all of it. Compared to Deus Ex's tiny, or even the sprawl of Dying or Arkham - it's impressive, but the areas are also somehow forgettable and easy to get lost in.

Update: It broke my PC 2 weeks after playing. Havnt had it on my PC since jan '22. After watching edgerunners though im debating whether my PC is worth risking just to play it again.

And yes, it did get better!

Update 2:
Reinstalled the game over december on a new M.2. Though it suffers in some areas framerate wise (mainly in the city centre and pretty much anywhere with large crowds, leading me just to hang with the aldecados), everywhere else is amazing.

It's hollow, lacks a true immersive feel, and is trying to be 3 or 4 different genres all rolled up into one package, but never really mastering any. Plus, the main quest is entirely too short. I know, I know, ""It's designed to be re-played multiple times,"" I hear you saying, but I'm having the trouble finding the motivation. All-in-all, viewing this game objectively, past all the hype and expectations and standing on it's own, Cyberpunk 2077 is an average game that has its moments to shine.

Post-2.0, my mind hasn't fundamentally changed. A lot of the most egregious problems have been ironed out, but if you're going to to go at it on a purely technical level, the game is still pretty basic. The hacking is pretty much just magic with a sci-fi filter, the progression system makes more sense but is still a quite basic RPG skill tree. The graphics are great on paper but struggle with some very noticeable stuff at medium distances. 

But also, I don't think any of that matters all that much. Because I don't think any of that was ever the focus. I strongly hold the opinion that every cutscene is a failure of the game developer to properly utilise the unique medium that video games are. Cyberpunk is, in my opinion, among the absolute best games to use the options that the medium offers a storyteller. 

The thing that stands out about this game is how purpose-built it seems to blow you away on its first playthrough, everything after be damned. And without getting too philosophical, that in itself represents the experience it tries to convey really well. Night City gives you one shot, and you either knock it out of the park and become a legend or you'll rot in the gutter. Who cares what happens after. The same applies here. And they sure as hell knocked it out of the park. 

And I think that is wonderfully refreshing to see. Replayability is often - rightfully so - praised as one of the greatest features a game can have, if it's done well. But it's not the be all and end all. In that praise, it's easy to forget how precious a first time experience can truly be if that's what a game excels at. Cyberpunk sports some of the most well-written characters in the industry. It forces you to live through a story of a never-ending, gut wrenching struggle. And I mean it. You'll be invested in your own fate and the ones around you. And when the time comes to make the hard decisions, you'll make them, because you have to, and you'll feel like shit. 

All of that won't be the same anymore the second time around. And I couldn't care less, because the first time is so damn special. 

None of this is to say that even the first time around it's perfect. But I like to see the good in things. Try to see what the people who made them were trying to achieve and judge how well they did that. In order to do that, it helps me to focus on one thing. Yes, the way the side- and character stories interact with the progression through the main story can cause some strange pacing at times. But if you can look past that for a moment, brush it aside when it bothers you a lttle and push on through what really matters, and the game will take you on a one of a kind ride.

With the release of 2.1 update and Phantom Liberty expansion it was supposed to be the second coming of polish jesus, but hear my thoughts please. The great expansion only highlights how bland and mediocre the original game was and to extend - still is. Because all they added is some features that you could have added with mods if you wanted to, cringe ""dates"" with your companion where they re-use voice lines from the main story and what? Finally made the progression system and itemisation somewhat coherent? Wow, something that shoudve been in the game 3 years ago? And they still dont allow players to bind items on different keys, even for such a basic industry standart feature you need to install a mod. For the supposedly latest biggest update the game is still in many ways a broken mess held with a duct tape. It still looks ugly af unless you remove the green tint, vignette, crouch vignette, tweak some DLSS files in order to ease on the artifacts caused by Ray Reconstruction, melee finishers are broken, what happened to distant LOD quality anyway? Why the black levels are raised in both SDR and HDR when they are perfectly fine in Witcher 3? Why all of a sudden this game wants to consume up to 48 gigs of virtual memory?
When you look at the expansion you see things that shouldve been in the original game - non-generic gigs with tough moral choices, high quality textures and assets, iconic guns that actually use unique models sometimes and not just recolors, the levels of tension building during story missions not to mention two separate ways that lead to completely different playtrough and even can unlock a new ending based on your choices. A reminder that in the original ""The Pickup"" Is the only quest that actually affects further events in a meaningful way.

Everyone knows this game was HORRIBLE on launch. 
They've done a great job fixing this game. Still has some issues, but I'd say no more than Fallout 4 does.
Modding has helped me get the game to run how I want for my system but the game is great without mods.

My only complaint is stuttering while walking around populated areas and driving around in Nightcity.
But could be that I need to optimize some of my mods. I have a lot of mods for High res textures.
I find that I have to turn ray-tracing and path-tracing off and on while going from driving to walking around.

The story is strong (and covers themes that makes full use of its setting - this is a game that wears its Neuromancer inspiration on its sleeve and is all the better for it). The gameplay is tight, especially with the new changes in 2.0 (I've played 1.6, and the differences in the 2 patches are so stark they might as well not be the same game). It provides dialogue choices that felt well acted and natural (although Keanu's delivery is admittedly stilted, though there's some charm to it. Cherami Leigh as female V is great. Male V is also no slouch). The questing is great, though the pacing for the side-quests feels off compared to the main story. A timer could have been introduced to lay stress on the player - but then alas that's probably too hard to rework. The questing is mostly the issue here. There's a large cognitive dissonance between dying from brain cancer but still having all the time in the world to build your street rep and steal cars and all. I think Read Dead Redemption 2 nailed the balance. But its game design was slower, more deliberate; and you're a man looking for forgiveness. Cyberpunk's gameplay lends to fast paced dopamine rushes and gameplay that should be a part of Doom Eternal. The gigs are impersonal. You've no amends to make to Night City. Yet declining all these side missions for role-play purposes locks you out of much required experience and more importantly, meaningful content. It all doesn't jive.

Yet recommended. This is a game I thoroughly enjoyed despite its flaws (which are many). For whatever CDPR's faults for rushing it, there are obvious signs of dedication and work that went into Cyberpunk's birth. This is the equivalent to listening to your favourite artist's weaker albums (Hail to the Thief by Radiohead, First Impressions of Earth by the Strokes) where you can't help criticise the lows because the highs are absolutely amazing. Hoping that Cyberpunk Orion improves on whatever was learnt in the development of 2077. The track-run of CDPR shows hope for this: the leap from Witcher 1 to Witcher 2 was huge and largely for the better.

The story, writing and the world are just amazing, especially with the Phantom Liberty DLC. A lot of people do not like this game because of bugs and what not, but every single game has bugs. Some games that have bugs have gone on... years without being patched *Looks at Skyrim* yet they are still amazing. Cyberpunk is no different. I could go on but, that would take too long. ANYWAY, I am writing this review after my third play-through, starting off as a Nomad, then ending the game as one. The ending was utterly breathtaking. Most of the endings in this game have broken my heart (Songbird) and tear up. This one did too, but in a good way. The only other game that has done that to me is RDR2... Arthur Morgan. 

I could go on and on about the good and the bad, etc, but what I will leave you with is give this game a shot. I hope you will be pleasantly surprised. Find the secrets, do the good, the bad and the evil and have fun. Don't forget to check out the amazing modding community too.

There is an interesting story and would greatly recommend you pay attention to it as you will get out of it as much as you put in.

Never forget what this game was at launch. But now, this game truly is a masterpiece and that can't go without saying. From doing playthroughs ignoring side quests and characters to fully deep diving into each and seeing all of the many endings of the game, most leave you with a feeling that can't quite be defined in one word. Which is great, leaving an impact is the most important part of an ending. Of the now seven endings which includes the DLC ending, only two endings left me feeling not much or just satisfied. More than likely, your first playthrough will not be these two, as personally, my first ending was the most rare one, ""The Devil.""

Combat has been greatly improved since launch, as when I first started playing, around 1.4-1.5, combat was jank and uninteresting. I didn't branch out of an all melee build and refused to change. Now, I've tried out every cyber enhancement, every kind of weapon ranging from snipers to pistols because there are that many good guns that deal decent to major damage. It actually feels fun to switch up loadouts now due to how many fun guns there are. Being a netrunner also has its perks now. If you fully commit to being a netrunner and hacking your opponents and the environment, the game can be a fun point and click game that has enemies blinding themselves, to shooting allies, to killing themselves like LowTierGod is in their head commanding them what to do.

The music deserves its own recognition as only a little bit of the music is on streaming platforms like Spotify. The game has plenty of noteworthy and powerful pieces that are scattered throughout the game. Some of my favorites are ones I heard on my final playthrough, so don't expect to hear them all in your first playthrough.

Customization genuinely feels really vast and fun to experiment with. You can change your general appearance in game as well as clothing. The clothing combinations are genuinely endless, I didn't latch to any particular set of clothes as there are way too many great combinations to style your character on however you see them. Want a nomad look? You've got it. Business suit and rich class? Plenty. Street kid and punk? Loads. Being able to tweak your character's face and body also was a great addition. I wasn't fully satisfied with my character going into my last playthrough so I tweaked her around three times total. So the stress of having to get my character just right from the get-go wasn't an issue like other games.

This game was a blast for the majority of its run, and there's loads of stuff I haven't even mentioned in this review. I loved this game, even my earlier runs when the game wasn't fully optimized. Now, its incredible. (Still, I'd wait for sales. They come here and there so go save some money too!)",1707722900,1707722900,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

If your into RPG's and into sandbox games like GTA and alike, this game can be okay. Started as a nomad and the storyline is really good. I feel like the storyline is better than the gameplay itself so far. Combat is clunky at best (20 headshots with an SMG and its a hitpint system instead of a hit""box"" system so its just meh...) and the driving/traffic is silly. There are so many gimmicks with combat alone that it can be frustrating. 

If you've been exposed to Rockstar's GTA series and love them, don't expect this game to live up to that. If you love RPG's like something Bethesda would turn out, again......Don't expect it to live up to those either. I have to continue playing to determine if this review will require an update and I am obliged to try and get my moneys worth.

The story is full of intrigue, violence and moral dilemmas that keep the player constantly on edge. The decisions you make have real consequences and shape the course of the story in unpredictable ways.

The graphics of Cyberpunk 2077 are simply breathtaking. The developers have created a richly detailed open world filled with impressive graphics and visual effects.

The character models are incredibly realistic and the animations fluid and vibrant.

The combat system of Cyberpunk 2077 is as fascinating as it is challenging. It offers players a variety of ways to defeat their enemies.

Driving vehicles also feels stiff and lifeless.  If you're expecting GTA stunts and epic car chases, this game just doesn't have it.

Missions often drag you around to talk to 5 different uninteresting characters before you get into the action.  The dialogue is cringy.  Missions are linear and scripted, which would be fine if the gunplay was fun.

Yo, edge-runners! Forget the haters, forget the launch hiccups, because Cyberpunk 2077 is pure, unadulterated neon nirvana! Prepare to dive headfirst into Night City, a chrome-plated playground pulsating with life, danger, and more glitches than a malfunctioning neuralink. But hey, who needs a stable connection when you can ride a glitching car straight into a cyberpsycho mosh pit? It's like an interactive fever dream, and we wouldn't have it any other way.

Reasons to Jack Into This Digital Oasis:

Night City: It's more than just a cityscape, it's a living, breathing entity. From the mega corporate towers scraping the sky to the ramen-fueled back alleys, every corner pulsates with possibility (and the occasional exploding car, but hey, that's just Night City charm).
V is for YOU: Forge your own legend as V, a chrome-clad mercenary with more customization options than a black market ripperdoc. Katana-wielding samurai? Sure! Glitching netrunner? Go for it! Just remember, choomba, even the biggest cyberware can't fix bad fashion sense.
Choices with Extra Spice: Sure, some paths might be pre-determined, but who needs linear narratives when you've got branching storylines, impactful decisions, and enough side quests to keep you busy until the next expansion (speaking of which...).
Phantom Liberty DLC: It's here, baby! Dive deeper into Night City's underbelly with new missions, characters, and enough story twists to make your cybernetic head spin. Plus, who knows what other surprises CD Projekt Red has cooked up? Maybe Keanu Reeves returns with a jetpack (don't quote me on that, but a chrome cowboy can dream)!

But Wait, There's More!

Sure, there might be a few technical hiccups (think of them as cyberpunk easter eggs!), but the developers are constantly patching things up, adding new content, and listening to the community (remember, choombas, even the loudest complaints can't drown out the roar of a tricked-out motorbike).

So, is Cyberpunk 2077 the perfect game? Nah, but it's a damn good time. It's a love letter to the genre, a playground for the imagination, and a testament to the power of sheer, unadulterated glitch-fueled fun. So grab your katana, download the expansion, and jack into Night City, choomba. You won't regret it (unless you forget to save, then maybe a little).

P.S. Don't forget to check out the mods! They're like cybernetic implants for your experience, making everything even more glorious and, let's be honest, sometimes even more hilariously glitchy. Just remember, moderation is key. You wouldn't want your brain to overload and short-circuit in the middle of a heist, would you?

The feel and atmosphere in the city is remniscent of not only Bladerunner, but Akira, Mad Max, Johnny Mnemonic, The Matrix and Jet set radio future. It really gives a lot of different feels and atmospheres.
Now gameplay wise I enjoy the combat, I can effectively kill people without much hassle, the difficulty will need to be turned up when you get used to combat.
The Driving is what id expect from and RPG, not too fast, not GTA, perfect for city traversal in a game about feel and atmosphere. Im in no rush! 
Story and missions wise, ive never seen a game with cinematic side-missions of this calibre, every single mission outside of regular or small missions made me feel part of something bigger and or more serious, like they actually had an effect on the game world rather than ""Go here, talk to boring NPC, Bring thing back"" like in Skyrim, Oblivion etc. It doesnt feel like im talking to a wall with bad voice acting. 
None of this feels copy and pasted so far at 51 hours in, after doing both story and side missions. 
Things i dont like are the fact you cant tune cars, the pedestrians feel like one giant homologous unit or hivemind, and id definitely want more interactivity with the buildings as looking at them is great but I do want to venture inside at least a few of them.

The patch was released on Jan 31st, 2024. I leave this review on February 11th, 2024. 

The same day the review was left I wanted to go back and complete Cyberpunk after I took a break in early autumn 2023. So I updated the game, uninstalled all mods, then installed 11 mods. 4 of them being utility, allowing other mods to work: Redscript, Red4ext, Mod Settings, Cyber Engine Tweaks. Others were not adding anything new, but enhancing the base game: Immersive First Person, Always First Equip, No Intro Vidoes, Immersive First Person Camera Fix, No More Out-Leveling Vendor Items, JB Long Sleeves and Immersive Driving.

When I lauched the game, my PC froze for a quick sec, then I received System Service Exception BSOD. I tried launching the game without mods, even deleted every single one of it, and turned off mods in the launcher. Received the same BSOD again. I was not able even to go past the splash screen with Cyberpunk logo where you have to press Space to proceed. 

I found a solution online, and the game launched, and I was even been able to load in my save and go back to the starting apartment to collect the reward for completing all gigs in one of the districts. Then, when I tried to leave the apartment complex, the game crashed to the desktop, and AMD Adrenalin claimed to record driver crash. I was using 23.11.1 instead of the latest 24.1.1 driver version, as any other game I played at the time, did not want to work with 24.1.1.

So I installed all mods again, and tried to launch the game. The game launched, and allowed me to complete a date with Panam quest. Then the game crashed again, as I was trying to leave the apartment building after I threw a knife at a TV screen in the elevator. 

After that the game refused to start again, so I found a solution again. The issue was that the game would not work if I remap controls to my liking. So I removed all mods and disabled them in the launcher, and renamed files that contain controls, and another file that is supposed to do something with razer hardware and it's lighting, as it was claimed that this file can also cause crashes (I do not have anything from that brand). I believe renaming those files would force the game to regenerate them, restoring the default settings.

So it helped, I was even able to drive around the city and have a small shootout with the cops. Then, I alt tabbed, and received a green screen of death saying that Critical Process Died. So I found a solution again, one guy on Reddit said that it may be caused by corrupted shader data, so I cleaned up shader cash via Disk Cleanup tool, restarted the system and then additionally made a shader reset in AMD Adrenalin.

As soon as I pressed Play button in the CDPR launcher, my computer crashed so hard, my primary monitor lost connection whilst the secondary one was showing nothing but glitches in different shades of pink and yellow. 

I am done.

One hell of a ride!

This is Night City... don't go looking for a 'happy' ending. The game will let you make your own choices. You decide who your character is, and how they will play. You will get the ending you.. well.. deserve. 

The game has come a long way since the clusterfck of a release. Sure, there are still some occasional glitches (you car might spawn on top of a building, loot might get stuck under a wreck with no way to retrieve it, etc.) but.. in general, it is pretty polished. 

My recommendation is to make save points before taking on quests that feel like a decision point. You might be surprised at the outcome, and want to try another path. You have many options. 

Also, the DLC is a MUST. The story there and the gameplay is even better than the main story, if even harder to figure out what is ""right"". Night City, and Dogtown especially, is a grey world.",1707673433,1707673433,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Cyberpunk 2077 is the first game in over ten years to break into my list of top five video games of all time. No other game has gotten me so interested in the lore and history of its world, made me draw up full character outlines ahead of my next playthrough, caused me sleepless nights pondering the fates of my favorite characters. It truly is breathtaking, and to this day—after four full playthroughs—I still can't shake that feeling of excitement ahead of a new run.

Part of that excitement includes the prospects of playstyle, how you want to approach the obstacles put in front of you; will you use brute force, tearing enemies to shreds with a shotgun, machine gun, or your cybernetically modified [i]Gorilla Arms[/i]? Will you perhaps take a more discrete approach, using your implants to turn invisible and slip by enemies like a shadow? Or how about hacking the planet; taking over cameras, turrets, hell, even taking control of your enemies and forcing them to blow their own brains out? Or just say fuck all that, and mix things up - sneak your way into position before unleashing a rain of hellfire on your enemies, become a cyberninja jumping and dashing all over the place before slicing your enemies into pieces with a katana or [i]Mantis Blades[/i] implanted into your arms, or become the most skilled mercenary Night City has ever seen using only your guns and wits without installing a single implant. Phantom Liberty and the 2.0 update have only widened the possibilites and turned 2077 into the game it was always meant to be.

Honestly, I doubt I could name another game (that I've played, at least) that handles the locale it takes place in as well as Cyberpunk 2077 does Night City. It feels exactly like it should: lived in, grimy, and unforgiving – with so many interconnecting stories and cool little details around every corner. As a fan of other cyberpunk media (some which inspired Cyberpunk when it was created back in the 80's by Mike Pondsmith and R. Talsorian Games, others which may well have been inspired by Cyberpunk itself) – films such as Blade Runner (and 2049), literature like William Gibson's Sprawl trilogy, games in the vein of Deus Ex and System Shock, and that's only scratching the surface – NC feels like the amalgam of them all.

But what would Night City be without its people? From the faceless megacorporations and their drones who would do anything in the name of profit, to the lowly punks eking out something resembling an existence on the street. What seperates Cyberpunk 2077 from its peers is without a doubt its cast – key players like Johnny Silverhand (famously portrayed by Keanu Reeves) and our protagonist V are at times even overshadowed by the likes of ""side characters"" such as Goro Takemura, Judy Álvarez, and [b]Panam Palmer[/b] (the best character in the game, no question). Their one common denominator, however, is that we don't get enough time with them. I would play entire games focused simply on them, from roaming the Badlands alongside Panam, to a prequel set in 2020s Night City with characters like Silverhand and Rogue... I could go on. Above all, 2077's characters leave you simply wanting more of them.

What I think prevents a lot of people from really getting into Cyberpunk is that they are not willing to play by its rules – they go in expecting a totally free-form RPG where you can be anybody and do anything. That is simply not the case. 2077 should be approached the same way one approaches the Mass Effect trilogy: you're going to play as Shepard/V, even though you can influence his/her personality and background through your choices, fact remains that you are only in the driver's seat of their story. If you can come to terms with that, a fuckin' great story awaits you. And if you have the patience for it, I highly recommend multiple playthroughs to explore the variety of branching paths available to you. If you have the time, do three different playthroughs as the different lifepaths (my personal order was 1. Male/Streetkid; 2. Female/Corpo; 3. Male/Nomad – my favorite turned out to be my third and final run) – that's when the game truly opened up for me, when I could plan ahead of my second and third playthroughs; what choices I would make, what ending path to pursue, etc.

I'm so incredibly happy that Cyberpunk 2077 got the second chance it deserved, and with the release of 2.0 and Phantom Liberty the general public's perspective on the game is [i]finally[/i] starting to shift, and people are beginning to recognize it as the magnificent game that it truly is. It really is true that a thing of beauty never fades away.

Whatever happens with the rumored sequel codenamed Project Orion, that we had the opportunity to experience 2077 and Phantom Liberty is something I will always be thankful for. I can only hope that we will get some very happy returns when we do eventually get our hands on it (Panam, I'll be waiting for you...)

TLDR; Lazy GTA reskin with cybernetics. 

Not sure it was worth the full price. This release version is barely Beta quality with a number of bugs and poor UI issues. Would not recommend to a friend until they've fixed and improved on a lot of issues. Missing keybinds that you can't change, changing or removing a keybind doesn't always work as pressing the key or button still results in the action being performed even if it is bound to something else. Attachments/mods don't tell you what they work with, so you could buy a sight for your pistol and not be able to use it on your pistol but there is nothing in the tooltips or UI that warns you of that before you spend your monnies.

I guess the corporation behind the developers made the game into this mess, or at least mainly responsive to it. [spoiler] It's almost ironic considering what is the story about [/spoiler]

Even though I really liked the story and a lot of the characters in it, I don't support what they did to this game. Hopefully they start focusing on making games in the future.

Review (Phantom Liberty included) (Significant Spoilers! Play first!):
[spoiler]
Cyberpunk 2077 is a game not necessarily driven by its gameplay. The gameplay is solid, even great at times, but in my opinion other aspects stand out. In that regard it is much like CD Project Reds last game, The Witcher 3. Solid gameplay, but the world, story and characters are what keeps one playing.
A few points I want to talk about.

Gameplay:
Put points in cool (It is Cyberpunk, how could you NOT put points into that!?) and reflex. Take a Katana, and you can deflect or even reflect bullets. At higher levels, chrome let’s you slow down time to a point, that you are literally unstoppable. Gameplay that makes you feel like a badass.

Characters: 
Characters in this game are memorable, complex and show development. Some are your best buddy, and you hate others. Some betray you and others can be betrayed by you. The dialog is well written, and conversations are interesting. One comes to mind, it is between Johnny and V while on a Yacht. The Yacht is inside a harbour which is part of a side mission, but no marker indicates that something can be found on the Yacht [4], which ties into my next point.
J: See, V? People in the city're eating' out of tubes, sleepin' rough, and here... Golden shitters. Where's the shame? Wheres the Fuckin' shame?
V: I don't know, Johnny. Lemme just ask the next billionaire I bump into on the street - tell 'im Johnny Silverhand asked.
J: No need to ask anything. Just spit in their face.
I like it for three reasons: (1) It characterizes Johnny, (2) It describes life in Night City and (3) it poses a real question.

Quests:
I was surprised, how much content is hidden in side missions. But not just filler content, I would argue that some of the best missions can be found there. For example, the whole story arc with Kerry can be missed. Some of the best, albeit very minor “characters” are found in side missions (Looking at you, Brendan and Skippy). Therefore, it feels very rewarding investing time in them.

Music: 
Music is a strong theme in cyberpunk. 
(1) At one point I was driving around when something caught my attention. The song I was listening to on the radio was written like a rapper living in Night City would write it, complete with locations and slang. That is immersive and shows dedication to the world building.
(2) Johnny Silverhand is a Rockerboy, which is a real class in Cyberpunk 2020. There are missions involving Samurai, his old band, where you can play guitar or listen to the band. This fictional band is on streaming services, which ties nicely to the next point.
(3) All mission names (after “meeting” Johnny) are song titles. And not random songs but ones whose motif relates to the mission and which Johnny would listen to [1, 2]. 

Cyberpunk 2020:
Cyberpunk 2077 is built upon the tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG) Cyberpunk 2020 by Mike Pondsmith. Apparently, the polish translation of the TTRPG was done by early CD Project Red members [3]. A copy of the rulebook is included in the game – cool! Some aspects are very faithfully to the original. For example, the abduction of Alt is a short story inside the rulebook as well as one of Johnny’s songs, albeit with different text. Those are some details that are probably very cool to find for long time fans. But more importantly, they captured the feeling of Cyberpunk. 

Endings:
V: “A happier ending, for everyone involved?"" 
J: ""Here? For folks like us? Wrong city. Wrong people.” 
Creating an ending with closure and as little loose ends as possible is hard. The endings in Cyberpunk 2077 did it. Yes, they did it multiple times! They are filled with hope, bittersweet or just heartbreaking. Vastly different in tone and implications, only hinting at things or leaving them to the imagination. You can give up on V’s goal – what even is V’s goal, you could argue that it changes over time - or you can do everything to reach it. But beware, you may have to [i]pay the price[/i].
I feel like V’s story is over, and that is a good. 

Hinting and Foreshadowing:
The Ripperdoc Viktor can often be seen watching the recording of a boxing match. Near the end of the story V can ask him, why he is watching that match over and over if he knows the outcome. He answers that he is wondering, why his favorite lost, what was his mistake, he fought well. He concludes, that his only error might have been, that he went into the ring against a stronger opponent - Which has beautiful parallels to V’s story [5].
There are a lot of these details and foreshadowing. Some on the nose, others hidden. But, as with many aspects, most things are in the game in the way they are for a reason! 

The World:
The world is beautifully crafted. Graphically it is breathtaking. There are so many details (Places, People, Dialogue, Graphics). Night City comes to life. Hell, it might even be the ultimate villain of the story.

The Bad:
I do not want to give a one-sided review, but let me emphasize, they these points are just minor. I was missing shuriken as weapons, some animations of finishers were missing or lacking, some bugs and even a crash or three occurred. The launch in 2020 was apparently abysmal. 

Final words:
Cyberpunk 2077 is by no means a perfect game, but it is nonetheless a masterpiece. I still think about it after finishing it and it made me write this review - which are signs of a great game.

I loved this game, it definitely cracked my top 10, maybe top 5, we'll see how it digests. I've finished the campaign and achieved 3 endings, all but 1 were depressing.

I guess if I had anything bad to say about it was they could have done more with the emergent aspects of this game and less on the quests. There are too many quests! 

While about 2/3 through the story line of the game I felt like it was enough already, although it was an open world, it still felt a little bit on rails for the potential that was there, yes it was open world, and very well fleshed out, but only on the surface.... 

But that's nitpicking, it really is, the limitations that held CDPR back will be gone with advancements in AI and the next iteration will be more in that direction (I hope)

I have not enjoyed a game this much in a very, VERY long time and really appreciate what they achieved, ranked up there with KOTOR, Neverwinter Nights.

I wish I could play this game again, for the first time.

I loved it

[SPOILERISH]

I was disappointed I couldn't continue playing after finishing the game, I hope that's because there's an expansion or the sequel will allow me to continue this story.

Basically open world, budget/knock off Deus Ex Mankind Divided. The environments are all pretty bland, one dimensional and forgettable, as are the unlockable abilities (instead of a cool new ability, usually just a % buff/debuff). The combat is the same as DX with bad AI. Inventory is just plain bad.

If you enjoyed stalking around buildings, learning AI paths and sneaking into an area that has a few skill checks in it, CP77 scratches that itch, albeit barely.

Combat is relatively poorly implemented in vanilla, with all enemies being stupid bullet sponges that have no tactical skills, and weapons all being pea shooters. Realistic combat overhaul is a must for this game, I cannot recommend you even think about playing without it. The enemies are less noticeably dumb when they kill and die in under a minute. 

If you want a coherent, relatable, well written story, you may not be in luck. The story is messy, with badly written dialogue full of impenetrable shorthand that seems awkward by design. The characters range from semi likeable to unlikeable morons who serve as vessels for mission giving and nothing more. Characters are introduced, killed and betrayed so quickly it's all a blur.

The world is insanely unfinished. Large swaths of the map are inaccessible by default due to being abandoned part way through development. Many intended interactive elements are awkwardly removed, like chairs you can't sit on and vendors you can't talk to. 

The intro to the game is a betrayal of several pre launch promises. Your life path is totally irrelevant to the majority of the game, as are all your decisions. You still go to the same places and do the same things no matter what, bar a couple of token variables flipped.

The soundtrack has some real bangers that I listen to outside the game (Dead Pilot anyone?) but there is NO synth wave, which is a huge mistake in a cyberpunk game.

The constant injection of modern politics gets very grating. 

Game is badly optimised even nearly a year after launch. Just runs sloppily and has a whole lot of performance oddities and spikes. Built in AA is lacking, as is the MANDATORY sharpening filter, which is full of grain and noise. Most effects should be disabled and replaced with reshade (including removing green filter). 


tl;dr:
*without mods, 5/10 broken
*with mods, 7.5/10 playable semi broken pseudo RPG
*extreme quality issues, expect possibility of refund for technical reasons
*WAIT FOR BIG SALE, over 25% off at least
*crappy spyware launcher that you are forced to install for no reason and isn't listed on the store page
*needs 40+GB space free at all times to update
*can't change your keybindings because there are duplicates of the same binding (crouch toggle, crouch hold, sprint toggle, sprint hold) and the game won't let you save changes unless EVERYTHING is bound
*of course the walking speed of the player is 10% faster than any NPC so you have to spend all of the VERY LONG dialogue scenes stopping and starting just like witcher 3

These developers are utterly useless. This is a s**tty Witcher 3 mod.

Pros: Whole lot of quests/missions to do in Night city, graphics are top notch (if you have a rig to turn everything on), decent main story.
Cons: Abysmal bugs (graphical glitches to quests getting bugged and cannot be completed), horrible AI (if even by accident  a civilian dies, the cops just spawn next to you and start shooting), forgettable characters (I mean someone who made Witcher 3 and gets this wrong?), terrible crafting system, life paths (what life paths? they converge within first 20 mins of playing).

All in all, this is a forgettable game. CDPR marketed this game as like the second coming of christ and it falls short on every aspect. Best I can give is 9/10.

TLDR, if the game seems interesting to you, play it. It's worth your time, with great gameplay / visual / audio / music / story. In more detail: 

Ok, I need to give context here. I played around 40h of Cyberpunk when it released in 2020, but that was mostly the open world stuff, and then I left it due to another game and I didn't return to it until Phantom Liberty released in 2023. At that stage, I went and finished the main game with all its achievements and the same for Phantom Liberty. 

145h later, Cyberpunk 2077 is an amazing game and anyone that likes open world games, first person shooters and a story driven game with high production value, should play it. 

To take the easy things out of the way, visually and graphically is pretty much one of the current benchmark games we have to check what our PCs can handle. It's not consistent throughout though, clearly certain areas had more dev love, but that is to expected with a world of that size. There are so many moments that you stop just to admire the vistas in front of you, and ofc cutscenes and overall characters are really well executed. 

Audio and music are top notch, with many songs worth listening long after you finish the game.

Music and visual, add so much on driving in Night City. Driving is fluid and fast, and picking the radio station that you like, and driving around this beautiful world is incredible, to the point that I ended up driving to most places instead of fast travelling. 

The world is very big, but most importantly, densely packed. There are many many quests and overall mission types scattered around and its hard to stumble in one of them every few blocks. Many of them are the classic mission style you would expect from open world games, but still, under the setting and due to the core gameplay, they work. 

Gameplay is improved vastly with 2.0 update, and skills matter more now, you can customize your character to your liking, find fun weapons and overall end up becoming a very fast and effective killing machine (if that's what you like). Solid gun-play and the movement abilities you unlock allow you to maneuver around any combat scenario in a pretty satisfying way. 

Last, and most importantly for me about Cyberpunk, is the story and setting. 
Main game provides a solid story with memorable characters and an amazing 'side-kick' that works so so well! The game is well written, and it provides multiple paths throughout the story that affect your relationship with some of the characters but also the outcome of the game. It has multiple endings, and amazingly, each ending is not just a cutscene, but around 2 full hours of story and gameplay with unique missions. Really well done and it's worth 100% to explore all endings. 

And then they released Phantom Liberty, which is more like a spy/thriller type of story, connects a bit to the main one, and it's again, really good and worths your time. 

To wrap it up, Achievements in the game are straight forward, and all achievable in one play-through, but for that to happen you need to keep multiple saves throughout the later story so you can go back and replay certain parts to get the different outcomes. And that is the case for both main game and dlc. But was totally worth it since you reward for that was all the multiple endings the game has.",1707587550,1707587550,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

The story of the game recognizes that in a cyberpunk world, poverty is still a rampant problem, corruption only increases with power, the rich still get richer, and those in the dregs of society continue to suffer. Despite the world being filled with brutality, hedonism, and cyber-psychosis - there are underdogs that would fight for truth and a better world. This attack on the ""system"" is what makes playing this game, especially in first-person, so interesting and engaging.

Even after 100%ing the game I still can't get enough of Night City and sometimes start new games immediately after I finish the previous one. I wasn't around for the launch but was there pre-2.0 and it only got better with the launch of Phantom Liberty which is like a whole other game itself on top of the main story. Going in I didn't expect much due to what I've heard before about the state of the game on launch but was blown away when I found out my first 5 hours was just the prologue. Sure, there's features that were promised to be there on launch that are still missing and I'm not excusing their absence. However what we got is still impressive. During the story I really resonated with some of the characters and their questlines and even V themselves. They all felt like I was talking to a real person other than some other generic NPC in any other game that's about to hand me a fetch quest. Even after one of the game's endings any characters you met and engaged in their stories will call V and give some commentary on their actions. Gunplay and build variety is satisfying and is fun to experiment with and come up with challenges on how to play, for example pistol only. There's tons of weapons to choose from ranging from a lead pipe to a lock on explosive shotgun, with iconic variants that have unique looks and effects. There's also tons of side jobs dotted around the map that even have stories of their own to either tackle along the main story or blast through after you've finished and have the best gear. Either way you'll be busy for hours. So if you're still on the fence about getting this game, do it. You won't regret it, choom.",1707576527,1707576527,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Introduction

1. The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in “advanced” countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in “advanced” countries.

2. The industrial-technological system may survive or it may break down. If it survives, it MAY eventually achieve a low level of physical and psychological suffering, but only after passing through a long and very painful period of adjustment and only at the cost of permanently reducing human beings and many other living organisms to engineered products and mere cogs in the social machine. Furthermore, if the system survives, the consequences will be inevitable: There is no way of reforming or modifying the system so as to prevent it from depriving people of dignity and autonomy.

3. If the system breaks down the consequences will still be very painful. But the bigger the system grows the more disastrous the results of its breakdown will be, so if it is to break down it had best break down sooner rather than later.

4. We therefore advocate a revolution against the industrial system. This revolution may or may not make use of violence; it may be sudden or it may be a relatively gradual process spanning a few decades. We can’t predict any of that. But we do outline in a very general way the measures that those who hate the industrial system should take in order to prepare the way for a revolution against that form of society. This is not to be a POLITICAL revolution. Its object will be to overthrow not governments but the economic and technological basis of the present society.

5. In this article we give attention to only some of the negative developments that have grown out of the industrial-technological system. Other such developments we mention only briefly or ignore altogether. This does not mean that we regard these other developments as unimportant. For practical reasons we have to confine our discussion to areas that have received insufficient public attention or in which we have something new to say. For example, since there are well-developed environmental and wilderness movements, we have written very little about environmental degradation or the destruction of wild nature, even though we consider these to be highly important.

THE PSYCHOLOGY OF MODERN LEFTISM

6. Almost everyone will agree that we live in a deeply troubled society. One of the most widespread manifestations of the craziness of our world is leftism, so a discussion of the psychology of leftism can serve as an introduction to the discussion of the problems of modern society in general.

7. But what is leftism? During the first half of the 20th century leftism could have been practically identified with socialism. Today the movement is fragmented and it is not clear who can properly be called a leftist. When we speak of leftists in this article we have in mind mainly socialists, collectivists, “politically correct” types, feminists, gay and disability activists, animal rights activists and the like. But not everyone who is associated with one of these movements is a leftist. What we are trying to get at in discussing leftism is not so much movement or an ideology as a psychological type, or rather a collection of related types. Thus, what we mean by “leftism” will emerge more clearly in the course of our discussion of leftist psychology. (Also, see paragraphs 227-230.)

8. Even so, our conception of leftism will remain a good deal less clear than we would wish, but there doesn’t seem to be any remedy for this. All we are trying to do here is indicate in a rough and approximate way the two psychological tendencies that we believe are the main driving force of modern leftism. We by no means claim to be telling the WHOLE truth about leftist psychology. Also, our discussion is meant to apply to modern leftism only. We leave open the question of the extent to which our discussion could be applied to the leftists of the 19th and early 20th centuries.

9. The two psychological tendencies that underlie modern leftism we call “feelings of inferiority” and “oversocialization.” Feelings of inferiority are characteristic of modern leftism as a whole, while oversocialization is characteristic only of a certain segment of modern leftism; but this segment is highly influential.

Have not finished it yet as of writing this review but the story is engaging, and the overhauled game mechanics are a lot of fun to play around with. Very much recommended, even if it is just to give it a shot.

The atmosphere of Night City speaks as a new example for what an immersive game can be. The city is alive with things to do like fighting crime, random encounters, shopping for guns or cars or clothes, and dealing with chromed-out monsters flesh out the world as you move from quest to quest. Each of the offered playstyles are unique in dialogues as well as the gunplay, ranging from weapons that penetrate cover to ones that can simply fly around cover, truly giving you a sense of identity to your character. Cyberpunk allows you to make your own V to express how you live in the world in both combat and in role-playing. It’s a game with enough narrative agency to control how the story goes from the lifepaths at the start to the endings born from your decisions. Everything in the hours between depends on which characters you decide are worth your time. You can help an ex-cop find a missing person, a fiery grease monkey on the fringes of her family, and more. The stories told in both the main quests and side-quests are both touching and thrilling. Human stories sprinkled with bionic action sequences. 

Among its countless patches are several passes of rebalancing and re-working and patching to make a game that feels streamlined and balanced. The game has gone from a tangle of clumsy mechanics that trips over each other to a cohesive network of systems that actually feels pretty player-friendly. For example many of the health items have moved from quantities you find on the ground to simply recharging the item. One of the playstyles gives you a suite of hacking abilities to take out entire rooms without drawing a weapon. The Cyberware you can install gives you even more ways to play. The clothing system has been rebuilt to use an expansive transmog system to further create a character that is truly yours. There’s even been a photo mode added.

The game is incredibly buggy, glitches with flickering NPCs and UI, running through people.

The whole AI seems like a placeholder to me, something they put in in the early dev stages and forgot to finish.
Cops spawn out of nowhere when you shoot someone without anyone seeing you. The stars you get make no sense.
Running around a corner makes them forget about you.

On missions, enemy AI is also incredibly buggy. You get spotted in one area, kill everyone present and move to another area and they somehow know about you and see you immediately, as if they saw you through the walls.

Pedestrian AI is unreactive, bumping into people doesn't do anything, just plays a single animation. They don't fall, they don't stumble, they don't say anything, nothing at all.

The driving mechanics seem really weird, synthetic, not natural. Running into cars or people is not enjoyable as it would be in GTA.

The character building system is too shallow, not too much space for really custom, unique characters. They advertised something completely different and it turned out to be a lie.

Overall, the most frustrating thing about the whole game is that the world feels lonely. No cop cars, co taxis, no buses, no vans. Can't enjoy being a villain like I would in GTA, just terrorizing the city. 

Imo, the biggest issue is the faulty AI. Without this issue, I might have enjoyed the game a bit more.

12 hours in, but attempted a refund, reason - false advertising and performance issues.

UPDATE: first refund request declined ... I made another and I made a strong point as to why it should be refunded. C'mon Valve ...

Second request rejected. I mean, CDPR fucked us all over, so how can I force them to give me my money? It's not exactly cheap, so ...

UPDATE 2: fuck this, I'm gonna wait for patches

UPDATE 3 (5/13/21): The difficulty of this is so overwhelming and the enemies are so OP that it cannot be played.

Never played it again after this.

UPDATE 4 (Feb 7, 2024): God dang it, I must say that the game feels and plays much better now. Don't know why, but I just feel immersed, pulled in. Changing my initial opinion from not recommended to recommended.

UPDATE 5 (Feb 10, 2024): Wow ... I got further into the story, esp. the parallels to the main plot, and I must say that this is one of a few games that could talk to me emotionally. It really managed to pull me in. Not gonna spoil, so just gonna say that even a seemingly unimportant side character who has a couple of side quests is so well-written and believable that I just can't think of any other game that was able to do this to me. The closest would be MGS, but even that was mainly through cinematics, whereas here it's through choices you make regarding the characters.",1607777857,1707547034,True,0,0,0.541984736919403076,0,True,False,False

This game captures the cyberpunk genre almost flawlessly. The city is full of details, interesting areas, citizens, punks, gangs, police, people of all sorts. Many side quests to the main story, plenty of ability to ignore the main story line and just do your own thing for a while.

Character customisation, wow, so much to do, not just skill points and a tech tree, cyberwear, weapons, clothing... everything you need to create and style your character how you want. There are also plenty of stat points and skill points so you can go into multiple skill trees easily, so you don't feel like you need to specialise into only 1 niche.

Quests, decent variety of quest types, driving, killing, sneaking, stealing, assassination, rescuing and multiple ways to complete. Questing options available based on your skill strengths as well, adds to the benefit of your character specialisations.

Overall, there are a lot of nice things they have put into the game that work well together, to provide an overall immersive experience into the cyberpunk world.

The game is cheaper to get for new players, and they are milking the old players by only putting phantom liberty on 15%. The first time it was an almost honest mistake, and I forgave it. Now, even so many years later, I can't ignore their true colors anymore. Drop in the sea, this, but, F CDPR. Money breaks good things. It broke those guys.

Cyberpunk is a very personal and imaginative experience and tells a foreboding story of what may be to come in the not-so-far future.

It's been a while since a computer game has glued me to my chair for 60 hours with barely a break between work/sleep/game. 

Mechanically its a well conceived system of running, gunning, hacking, driving/exploration, crafting and all of the RPG good stuff, albeit a little bit poorly documented - you barely know what exactly your stats do. What does Evasion: 1 mean? 1% ? 1 out of XXX? What exactly does Armor: 324 mean? Will 200 hp be alright for the next 3 levels? All interesting RPG questions that concern me as an RPG player that are not very well explained.

You get to have a 'build' AND play a curious hybrid of FPS and Melee, with various gadgets such as slowing time or hacking people (kinda behaves like spells). 

Maybe wait before getting though, because designers have put a lot of effort into making this a very immersive experience which is sadly mired in visual bugs that break your immersion ever so often.",1607993864,1707488671,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game immersivness has no challenger if you allow(and force) yourself to take your time, to let Night City breath into you.
The story telling, whole directing and narrative is incredible, Cyberpunk 2077 is the first game that manage to make me feel like im a part of a Villeneuve or Nolan movie. The writing is surpringly good and the voice acting top notch, it's violent, gritty, mature, everything you should expect from a Cyberpunk game.

However the game still has issue feature wise... The RPG aspect of the game is limited in the gameplay, LifePath being sacrified into a 10sec trailer did a huge damage to RP, and the player fail to learn Night City, the faction, gank, and urban legend... I will never understand that choice, specialy after crafting such a beliveable and immersive city.
Cyberpunk also constanly harass the player with Phone Calls (Quest/Gig) from unknown people, instead of making use of the Fixers and AfterLife to take missions at your own pace.
Game pacing suffer A LOT from this, it feels way too condensed, you never have to take your time to enjoy Night City to feel somekind of progression. The three main story quest are played at the same time for no reasons. artificialy stressing the player with a ""bomb in the head"" gimmick.
Clearly it has that console player/action pacing built, in a game who could have been a better RPG/simulation.
The game has also no money sink, car spawn and repair automaticaly, everything is incredibly cheap, and the player reach millions while still be asked to do errant job... 
As usual the player snowball very fast into becoming unstoppable, the game is also a bit too easy.

Some issue can be tweaked with mods, so I won't punish the game too hard about it...
Anyway Cyberpunk is a real experience, Night City and these characters are like no other in the actual gaming era. We can also tell that a lot of care have been injected into this game despite being a AAA for modern audience.

Cyberpunk 2077 was an Epic Journey for me, accompanied by masterpiece soundtrack.

I am quite surprised regarding their affinity for shooters and considered them to be RPG veterans and that's that. 

The character development in Cyberpunk 2077 is unfortunately not as strong as it could be, and the lifepaths are disappointing variations to an otherwise rather linear story. 

Nevertheless, the world and its writing is absolutely incredible and is undoubtedly the strongest aspect of the game. I strongly recommend this game to RPG fans with a strong desire for satisfying, fast-paced combat. If your main desire is player choice and creating a character that you can self-insert as, cRPGs are better suited to meet your needs. 

Night City is gorgeous and brimming with areas that you can explore. There isn't too much variety in terms of loot outside of weapons and cyberware... If you like cosmetics, there's a ton of loot when it comes to clothing. Other than that, it just boils down to crafting components for weapons and quickhacks. Traversal is amazing and you will LOVE to explore Night City, it's full of life and interesting locals. I adore the aesthetics and the various Gigs / side missions you come across. The star of the game is still the main mission.

It might be the extremely erratic behavior of the traffic lights or the random pedestrian dialogue that you might have heard for the 20th time (because some of the actors never move and they say their lines every single time you pass by them).

[h1]Introduction[/h1]
Cyberpunk 2077 is an open-world, action-adventure with RPG elements that was released in December 2020 and sought to set the world alight with its gritty story and stunning graphics. Unfortunately, the launch didn't go as planned, as the release was buggy and far from the game we expected. Fast forward to now, almost four years later, and the release of version 2.0 and the expansion, ""Phantom Liberty"", has seen the game revitalised. But is it enough to bring Cyberpunk 2077 from the dead, or did it just get a few extra breaths?

[table]
[tr]
	[th][b]🟩 Positives[/b][/th]
	[th][b]🟥 Negatives[/b][/th]
[/tr]
[tr]
	[td]🟩 The story, while confusing and poorly paced at times, is still enjoyable and full of unique twists and turns to keep you on your toes.

🟩 Graphically, this is easily one of the most beautiful games on the market, but you will need a literal powerhouse PC to pull that kind of performance from it.

🟩 The soundtrack matches the visuals, the music selection is impeccable as well as the general ambience of the city. With high-quality voice acting and dedication to make every district unique in its own right.

🟩 One of the best casts of companions in gaming who develop organically as the story progress and feel like real people.

🟩 2.0 saw a lot of rejuvenation to the original CP2077 formula. The rework to the skill trees, the addition of train travel and being able to spend some time with your romance choice, to name a few.[/td]
	[td]🟥 More bugs than an entomology lab.

🟥 No, seriously, there are A LOT of bugs in this game, some old, some new, and some game-breaking.

🟥 Visibly scripted quests ruin immersion.[/td]
[/tr]
[/table]

[h1]Story[/h1]
The story of Cyberpunk 2077 sees our main protagonist, V, awakening in Night City, starting in one of the three unique origin stories: Nomad, Streetkid or Corpo.

After getting to know your story, the situation in the city and meeting some key people, V and his best friend, Jackie Welles, get a job to steal a rare piece of Arasaka tech. For the remainder of the prologue, V spends time gathering intel and coordinating a theft that will set them up for life.

But with all the best-laid plans, this doesn't go as expected, and V ends up with an engram of the legendary rocker boy, Johnny Silverhand, stuck in his head. From this point on, V has to find a way to remove the tech in his head before it wipes away his entire personality and replaces it with Johnny's.

The storyline in Cyberpunk 2077 is intriguing and well-written for the most part, and its only major letdown is it's inadequately paced when completing side quests between main quest missions. In many of the side quests, you begin to build this relationship with Johnny Silverhand and slowly start to let your walls down as you get to know each other, then immediately lose this entire relationship when you return to a scripted main quest.

[h1]Gameplay Analysis[/h1]
[h3] It's the code you live by that defines who you are.[/h3]
CP2077 lets you play in nearly any way you wish, giving you multiple access points to any quest and usually providing a fair chance of coming out alive on the other side.

But a primary part of being able to do this is choosing a build that fits your playstyle. With the expansion, this is a bit easier as you are given ten additional levels to put into whatever you wish, but not impossible without it as long as you plan a little. And you have the choice of melee, gunner, netrunner, or a variant of those combined, depending on your preferences. The first two are pretty straightforward in what they entail, but netrunning is not as clear. It's practically your ability to hack enemies and things in your environment and cause damage from afar without firing a bullet.

[h3]There are no clean hands. But it is important how they become dirt.[/h3]
There are a lot of quests and side hustles to take part in across the city and quite a few impactful choices as well.

Many of these side quests hold engaging plotlines and provide unique rewards for completing them, such as iconic/unique weapons or vehicles.
It's unlikely you will unlock everything on your first playthrough, as there is a lot, and some of it is behind tough decisions you may not want to make.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3156325787

[h3]""Truth"" and ""Good"" are values proven to cause division, whereas beauty is universal.[/h3]
Cyberpunk 2077 offers a ton of customisation options to create a V that is truly your own. From near-limitless clothing choices to the type of vehicle you prefer to drive, you will likely find something that fits you.

Very few clothing choices offer significant benefits to V, and they are more just an expression of yourself than anything. You gain most of your actual armour and bonuses from the cyberware you choose to install and what skills you take.

All the cars and bikes handle differently from each other and offer you different benefits such as more armour to take fire and hits to faster and lighter vehicles for losing heat quickly.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3156324652

[h3]2.0 and all that it brings.[/h3]
The 2.0 update brought a lot of positive changes to the game, but with those changes came a lot of bugs and issues on its own. It was pleasant to see the balance of cyberware and rework of the entire skill tree systems, as well as the implementation of the train line at long last, despite never seeing a moving train once in the game. On their own, these are really positive changes that warrant praise, but I would have preferred a cleaner experience than a more complete one.

[h1]Audio and Visual[/h1]
This is still one of the best visual experiences in gaming to date, but as I mentioned above, you need a literal powerhouse of a PC to get that kind of performance out of it. That's not to say it's not without its imperfections, because it has many of them and plenty of visual bugs and issues. But when it's running as intended, and you're looking out at the city, and the sun is setting, there are few better moments than that.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3156323915

The audio is much the same, very high-quality but not perfect. The soundtrack and all the music in the game are impeccably well chosen and fit the game and its world to absolute perfection. The atmospheric and animation audio is decent but suffers from the occasional bugs, and some of it is frequently recycled.

[h1]PC Performance and Specifications[/h1]
With the game set to Medium (Raytracing) with some custom adjustments to my usual preferences, the game ran at a steady 60 FPS the entire time. I did encountered a lot of bugs whilst playing, of both the visual and gameplay kinds.
🟧 A lot of bugs and glitches. Quests not starting when they should, cars falling out of the sky, NPCs and loot disappearing into the ground, etc.
RAM: 32GB (Under Load Usage: 46.8%)
CPU: i9 10900KA 3.70GHz (Under Load Usage: 30.5%)
GPU: MSI Ventus RTX 3080 (Under Load Usage: 40%)

[h1]Final Thoughts - Good[/h1]
[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2529084785]Review chart here.[/url]
While I love Cyberpunk 2077, it's hard to recommend it as it has a lot of glaring flaws that really taint the overall experience. The decent story and somewhat fun gameplay loop are lost entirely when the immersion fades away because of teleporting police (yes, this still happens) or all your loot falling through the ground. It's certainly a worthwhile game on sale, but at full price right now, you're probably best saving that scratch for something less frustrating.

I enjoyed my playthrough but it had no real replayability and it was full of bugs and a lot of game mechanics and story elements were left kind of shallow with lots of room for improvement and expansion

Now, over 3 years later, it's in a way better state. Tons of new things have been added, the whole attribute skill tree system has been reworked, they've added new quests and vehicles and all kinds of stuff. The only bugs I've encountered were just wonky animations that didn't affect the gameplay at all. I've been having a lot of fun doing another fresh playthrough, again through family share, and I've been enjoying it so much I decided I would actually buy it myself.

Like many people, I figured 2.0 was as good a time as any to finally test the waters... and I'm glad as HELL that I did. Without the barrier to entry that was the launch period instability, combined with the quality-of-life improvements they've added along the way, Cyberpunk 2077 in its current state has cemented itself as now one of my favourite games of all time.

The crowning achievement of the game is its living, atmospheric open world. Night City is dense and sprawling, with countless nooks & crannies hiding that could be hiding anything as small as some loot or as big as a full-blown side quest. It's a joy to explore, a pleasure traverse, and generally immersive to just simply exist in as you soak up the ambience.

The other draw is where the RPG elements start to come through; and that's through the deep skill trees, progression and buildcrafting, and how the direction you take will drastically affect your approach to gameplay. I felt like combat was pretty rough and janky to start with... but once I started learning the nuances, and began to get some upgrades under my belt, it began to transform into something totally addicting. This game really does let you play out your wildest augmented cyberkpunk merc power fantasies. I've rolled a few characters now because I just wanted to check out more playstyles, and so far each one has been very viable and very fun.

There are only a few gameplay shortcomings, that honestly I probably would have just been able to live with... except I don't have to, because this is PC gaming and we have mods! Most of my gameplay has been augmented with the aide of just a few minor mods and their dependencies:

1. [b][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/9358]Unlocked Attachments[/url] (w/ Phinix Silencer Audio Fix)[/b]: my first playthrough was a stealth ranged one, and it's absurd to me that there are so few silenceable weapons in the base game. This is the first mod I grabbed, so that I wasn't restricted to using basically just pistols and the ONE silenced sniper rifle that exists in this whole city.
2. [b][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/11035]Craft All Scope Variants[/url][/b]: the numerous styles of weapon scopes in this game also come in a variety of colours - not that you'd know, since the name & icon are always the same. This quality-of-life mod utilises the scope icon variants that already exist in the game files, so you can tell whether a scope is bright pink or fluorescent green BEFORE you put it on your gun.
3. [b][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/5544]Vanilla Clothes Atelier Store[/url][/b]: because finding clothes in the base game is a painful experience... just hoping you get lucky and they appear in chests, or when shop stock refreshes. I find it really hard to believe that online shopping wouldn't exist in this capitalist dystopia.
4. [b][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4070]Silent Silencers/Throwing Knives[/url][/b]: pretty optional, mostly only felt like I needed this on a throwing weapons build, but it made it a lot more fun to play when every enemy in the game wasn't able to suddenly pinpoint my exact location from an axe I threw from atop a building 50 meters way.

An area that's both a strength & weakness would be the plot. CDPR have done a great job building out a believable game world out of the original game's lore, and paired that with an remarkable campaign and series of side stories that would make for incredible entertainment in almost any medium. Unfortunately for the game though, I had the unshakeable feeling of that old friend and late-2000's gamer hot topic: ludonarrative dissonance. In the opening hours of the game, you're basically TOLD you have a time limit - a fact I was so convinced of thanks to the gravitas the game places on this revelation that I actually had to check Google to make sure I wasn't REALLY battling against the clock.

That kinda takes a lot of the wind out of the sails of the plot, and it exacerbates my other issue which is the DELIVERY of it. It feels like you're being hurried along constantly and being pulled in all sorts of directions by all the side characters. Rushing back and forth between questlines as I progressed through my playthrough, I was frequently lost as I scrambled to remember what I'd previously done with this character days ago. It's very free-form and open how you approach the various plot branches, but a little better direction and perhaps less insistence with NPC's all demanding you come meet up NOW would have gone down well.

Those complaints aside, they didn't ultimately end up diminishing my enjoyment of the overall story too much - I was still satisfied with the outcomes my choices led me to, and the ending I landed on as a result. And considering just how good everything else is... the moment-to-moment experiences this game offers... it's impossible not to come away obsessed.

I must say I like the gameplay, I really do! And although the main story is pretty bland (V is boring. Sorry but I never cared for the Everyman trope. And Jhonny is a dick. Not interested in the least in theese two), the world seems interesting and vibrant. 
I had a major bug where the game crashed so often I had to constantly restart! After much tribulation to try and fix it, following every guide to no avail, I may have found a solution. It is not a perfect solution, though, as it gives me other problems; among others, the most obnoxious is the Frame Rate that sometimes drops consistently. And it also still crash sometimes. Nevertheless, I can finally play! Still, CDPR, please, make your game more stable. It could be great, but after so much time it is still not optimised and buggy and that's sad.
Anyway, now that I have finally completed it I must say that i liked it. As I said, the main story is kind of meh, not even close to The Witcher 3, so It is not a 10/10. Not even close. Ironically the side quests are a lot more fun and interesting than everything the main story have. 
I would give it a final rate of 7.5/10. A pass, although not a stellar one.

PS: I feel compelled to update my grade after the Dlc and 2.0 came out. I must admit I now find this game to be a 9 out of 10.

Thing is, that's what this game offers I haven't gotten from any other RPG lately that I can recall--ACTUAL roleplaying.  I felt like V.  I reacted to people who aren't real.  V became a real person and I was really getting into how he might think or respond to a situation, not how *I* would respond.  I can't explain why, but that makes me keep coming back to leave nothing undone.

Gunplay is mid at its best.  UI is not the best.  Time-slow trivializes every combat I've encountered regardless of difficulty.  Hacking can do the same.  None of that matters.  Game is fun and immersive as hell, voice acting (and this cannot be stressed enough) is TOP NOTCH.

Patch note doesn't include more features that were introduced this time, e.g. sudden framerate drops, weird AI behaviour, cyberwear malfunctioning and a lot more.
While Cyberpunk is a great, captivating game with a soul and tons of hard work put into it, I can't recommend anyone get it now, not until it's properly fixed once again. Really hope CDPR won't leave recent bugs unnoticed.

UPDATE 2.1.1 is out! Cyberpunk is still buggy as hell, most of the side content is raw and unfinished even though it's very cool storywise. Great game, it's a shame they couldn't finish it.

The environment is fun to traverse and the city itself is unique but its also repetitive and filled with duplicates of the same assets. The first boss fight glitched out for me and like many of the missions they weren't too challenging (played on normal difficulty) but the final boss was far harder than any enemy that came before which was frustrating. It lacked a smooth progression in that respect for my gameplay experience. The same for the tech abilities and crafting, its not pushed in the game and I forgot about it at times.  I played for 36 hours at the time of finishing the main storyline and hardly touched any side missions. There is a lot of content in here and that has to applauded. I played mostly on steam deck and found Running to be a difficult task at times. Especially in the final boss fight because it is a lot of running, dodging and taking cover. I definitely enjoyed the game overall but there are some unnecessary scenes (explicit in nature, which is fine but doesn't always add to the story progression). 

Warning: they recommend at least being at level 18 to beat the final boss. I was at level 26 just cruising through the game and there was an update to the final boss and they tanked a tank. You may want to level up more.

So, I finished the game and now I think I am in a good position write an honest review.

Both Cuberpunk 2077 and Phantom Liberty are... geez... [b]9.5/10[/b].

To start with - finishing both story lines took me 80 hours. Did most side gigs, explored a lot and did even more sightseeing.

[i] Take into consideration I played everything on maxed out visual settings [/i]

So, point by point.
[h2] NIGHT CITY and SURROUNDINGS [/h2]
+ Absolutely immersive. Huge, dark, crowded, dystopian and brutalistic;
+ The visuals are out of this world. The city lives. I spent good couple of hours just... admiring the place;
+ Neons and reflections. Dark alleys and those damaged people;
+ You sink into that place. It really resembles a real city with all those nooks and crannies;
+ It can leave you depressed for real;
+ Badlands kick ass to, with their post-apocalyptic desing and vibe;
+ Visual variety of different districts (darn, the cloth on unfinished buildings in Pacifica reacts to the wind...);
- Roads could make more sense. Especially the intersections on highways.

[h2] MECHANICS AND COMBAT: [/h2]
+ With 2.0 there's a lot of builds to pick from. 
+ Level cap of 60 allows to fully max 3 stats so one can be Netrunning Stealth Juggernout with Tech Affiliation.
+ Different feel of weapons to pick from. The variety is awesome. 
+ OBLITERATION. You can literally shoot your way through enemies or just do things silent.
+ Chrome - a lot to pick from.
- Vehicle control could be better. Some cars drive better, some less, but bikes, that should be the most agile of all feel like trucks with no turning radius.

[h2] STORY and SIDEGIGS [/h2]
+ I came here to have fun... not to feel... 
+ I'll just say that - finishing both storylines (CP+PL) left a gaping hole in my soul. 
+ The story is concluded. The end. Not much left untold and it feels good.
+ Lots of branching out smaller storylines. Each having it's own conlcusion.
+ Some things feel really bad, like [spoiler] letting Judy leave Night City [/spoiler].
+ There's more than one way to run things.
+ I really wish they've made more DLCs...
- I really came here to have fun and laughs... instead they made me feel stuff.

[h2] COMPANIEROS: [/h2]
+ They feel real and alive.
+ Johny is a pain in the butt in the beginning but the way the relationship between him and V evolves is... geez... it's good.
+ Interactrions with other people, random texts, talking sweet nothings. Make them feel more alive. 
+ Romances are generally good but
- It hurts that CDR scrapped the possibility to romance Judy as a male V :( 

[h2] CONCLUSION: [/h2]
[i]
The game left a gaping hole in my soul. The story is damn good, the choices are damn difficult, partings hurt deeply. The City is immersive and breathtaking. Brutal, unforgiving and sometimes all choices are bad choices.

I RECOMMEND THE GAME WITH ALL MY HOLLOW HEART.

Why does motorbikes shift gears 7 times from 0 to 60 mph ? each gear shift makes your bike wiggle and micro-glitch. You had Keanu, Founder of Arch motorcycles, you put his bike in the game and you dont even let him test it ?

Stuck in Delamain's HQ and no possibility to go back up the way i came (didint pick that double jump perk, my bad i guess ? should have played it the way you wanted) , only because i went in again (by the OPEN trapdoor) to loot the robots.

Cops randomly attack you if you help them kill their ennemies on random events.

I could've left it at that; a broken promise of a game that I wouldn't give a second thought. But I stuck with it because despite the gaping flaws, it was still a very intriguing universe to play in. After a few years, it has come to be one of my all time favorite games up there with Titanfall 2, Left 4 Dead 2, and others. Cyberpunk has had the most dramatic glow up in my opinion, especially with the recent 2.1 and 2.11 updates and Phantom Liberty. I love the world, the characters, the fighting mechanics and cyberwear, and Night City as a concept. It truly feels like the game that was promised in the beginning. This game is fantastic, and I will continue to sink my time into it. The modding community is wonderful as well which is always great to see with a game as intricate as this one. If you get the right cyberwear and build up your perks accordingly, fighting the gangs and other enemies can be a fucking amazing power fantasy.

Did not have high hopes for it, mostly just wanted to kill time. And well, I've played around 300 hours at this point. The main plot is similar to Neuromancer (the book that technically started the cyberpunk genre as a whole). Definitely not as intriguing or dense as a Deus Ex plot, however, even with a simplistic main story line the in game world more than makes up for it. If there is anything Cyberpunk achieved is creating a feeling of absolute immersion in a beautifully chaotic world, the constant stream of ads and the neon drenched streets of Night City, the constant gang wars, the random conversations between NPC'S on the street. The city feels alive like no other open world game has ever felt before (besides Breath of the Wild). This level of immersion is further exacerbated by how fleshed out and interesting all the characters are. From V, Johnny, Songbird, Reed and much more. This characters are complex, they are more than just people who give you missions, you actually feel like listening to what they have to say, their dialogue feels organic (unlike a certain Starfiled game)  they all  have emotional depth, backstories, they are all morally grey, which in turn makes them feel so humanized and relatable, even within a crazy world of talking guns (I love you Skippy) and bullet blocking swords. But not only does the game shine in this regard, the gameplay is amazing. So many build options, insane amounts of weapons, tons of missions, and tons of ways to tackle said missions. The movement is GREAT, with tons of verticality and very fluid movement, funny enough the worst way to move around the city is actually driving, it feels very stiff, but not to terrible either. Also, the game never directly tells you how to solve a mission, you can choose from a bunch of options, from pure carnage, to tactical stealth,  hacking (hacking is so fun) and sometime you can even complete a mission through the correct dialogue choices alone. Overall, yup, this game is great, and I will argue that CDPR deserves all the praise by taking something that was dead at launch , not giving up on it, and with care and passion making it an absolute must play banger. Oh and buy the complete edition, Phantom Liberty truly cranks up the base game to 11.

It was totally worth it.

The writing is great. The gameplay is great. The visual design is spectacular. I'd wanted to play an open-world cyberpunk game like this for many years, and it has exceeded my expectations.

I've gone with a Body-heavy build with lots of regenerating health. I'm playing this basically like Halo but with dialogue and exploration. I'm having a ton of fun with that. The gunplay is good, I don't feel like I've been missing out by mostly ignoring stealth and hacking. 

There's plenty of complexity to get my teeth into, but nothing that's given me choice paralysis. Most build choices I've made have had immediately noticeable effects that changed how I approached fights. That has been very satisfying. I never played before the 2.0 patch; I don't think I missed out.

Some systems are underexplained, but fan wikis etc. have been helpful. One I want to highlight is that health and grenade ""consumables"" are actually reusable items with cooldowns, not items you can run out of. This works nicely! I tend to hoard items, like many RPG players. This system's motivated me to use items often in combat, and I've enjoyed that. It adds depth and variety, and a reason to try out new tactics with no fear of ""wasting"" limited-use resources.

After I solved the crash-to-desktop problems that kept me from starting, I haven't noticed any other glitches. Frame rate dips in heavily populated areas, but nothing unreasonable for a PC as old as mine, and I've been pleasantly surprised that my frame rate has never dropped noticeably during combat.",1695256449,1707356493,True,0,0,0.517794191837310791,0,True,False,False

It's still very glitchy, anims are the worst offender, as well as general gameplay bugs.

Comparing 2.1 and 2.11 to day one, it appears to be a perfect, bugless game, but don't be fooled. While the current bugs aren't the worst in the world, it is still not to the standards of the AAA game it demands to be. 

I was not massive into this game at the start and discounting it as a glorified ubisoft game but by the end, I started to love it. I just hope the sequel does less checklists to pad out gametime and more natural gameplay. 

Furthermore it is easy to miss a lot of sidequests that are important to the story so it would be good if they were just part of the main quest as doing the main quest without them seems pointless.

It was then mixed with science fiction, and philosophy of existence, consciousness and artificial intelligence which lead me towards the works of Philip K. D!ck and William Gibson. After reading their novels, I was engrossed in cyberpunk media through film and video-games. This is where my passion for ""high tech, low life"" type of science fiction started to take root.

Upon Cyberpunk 2077's release, my anticipation led me to dive headfirst into the game. Initially, while I found enjoyment in some side missions, the main plot failed to engage me completely. Luckily, I encountered no game-breaking bugs, and graphical issues on my GeForce 1660 Ti actually never affected my experience. Completing my first play-through with the suicide ending, I've left the game feeling somewhat underwhelmed. The game was good, but it was nothing special for me at that time.

Returning to the game in June 2023 after various patches, my second play-through ended with a completely different experience. I came to understand that my initial disconnect wasn't the game's fault but rather my oversight. Ignoring crucial elements—romance, cyber-ware upgrades, and crafting—hindered my immersion. Exploring these mechanics in-depth transformed how I approached game play, which in turn offered a renewed sense of excitement and depth.

After dedicating over 380 hours, exploring the game across all difficulties and completing all of the achievements (including the Phantom Liberty ones), Cyberpunk 2077 has left an indelible mark on me. While trying to explore every facet, I've discovered that this game has an incredible ability to evoke a range of emotions, from heartbreak to elation.

With the continuous updates and the DLC, Cyberpunk 2077 has surpassed even my initial expectations, evolving into an experience beyond what I could have hoped for. Its adaptability to different play-styles and its vastness—especially in vertical exploration—encourages exploration and rediscovery. I eagerly look forward to revisiting this game every year.

In summary, I wholeheartedly endorse and recommend Cyberpunk 2077. Its evolution from an over-hyped shovelware, bolstered by consistent updates, has exceeded all possible expectations. It trully showcased the transformative power of videogames -  it showed that when developers care for what they create, and when they dedicate themselves to improving the game, they can overcome even the first horrible impressions, and step into the greatness. To me, Cyberpunk is one of the greatest games I've ever played and I can only hope that it will reach the cult status and be remembered along with the other amazing games that will - Never Fade Away!",1702261844,1707353529,True,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

On top of this it fixed numerous bugs and cleaned up glaring inconsistencies or issues in quests.

In short, gameplay-wise there's no misgivings left to stop me from recommending the game. As others say, update 2.0 basically finished the game.

Bugs-wise, there are still more bugs than GTA V for example, but thanks to update 2.0 there are less bugs in C2077 than in Skyrim or Fallout 4 (not sure about Starfield, haven't touched it)

Graphics-wise, the city is packed full of visual detail. You really need an RTX GPU and at least an i7 CPU. I've done potato gaming on older laptops, so I can say from prior experience that this won't be running on a potato.


As for my thoughts on actual gameplay: I enjoy this way more than any Bethesda game. The combat is better balanced and more interesting, and the writing is professionally done (Bethesda didn't have professional writers for Skyrim or Fallout 4). The things you do on one end of the city can have an impact on the other end.

And V didst walk the streets of corruption and neon, where the serpent of technology and the dove of humanity didst struggle in eternal enmity.

And behold, there was in the city a relic most coveted, which promised the secrets of immortality. But verily, its power was hidden, as the deepest mysteries of the Most High. And V, with heart bold and companions diverse, didst embark upon a quest to uncover this sacred and profane mystery.

In the days of V's journeying, many were the trials and tribulations. The corporations, mighty and cold as the north wind, didst plot with guile, and their armies of metal and circuitry were as a plague upon the land. But V was cunning, and with silver tongue and iron fist, didst navigate the treacherous waters of deceit and violence.

And lo, there came unto V a spirit, digital and yet most human, named Johnny Silverhand. And Johnny was as a prophet of old, crying out in the digital wilderness, a voice against the tyranny of the corporeal overlords. Together, they didst forge a bond, strong as the cables that doth bind the earth to the heavens.

Yet, remember, O reader, that the path of V was not one of mere flesh and blood, for the soul of humankind was intertwined with the machine, and the question of what it meaneth to be alive was as a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma, encrypted in the most arcane code.

So, let the tale of V be told, of battles fierce, of friendships wrought in the crucible of adversity, and of choices weightier than the heaviest of cybernetic implants. For in the chronicles of Night City, the deeds of the brave and the cunning are as a light unto the darkness, a testament to the enduring spirit of humanity amidst the chrome and neon shadows.

Thus, the tale unfurls like a scroll, full of sound and fury, signifying everything to those with ears to hear and eyes to behold the electric dreams of the cyberpunk age. Amen.",1706056526,1707334520,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

And as of patch  2.0 the gameplay is pretty damn good as well. i had gotten the chance to play through the game long back back when it was on patch 1.2-3 ish. and compared to then its a day and night difference . now the different builds you can have in the game actually changes up your playstyle in a significant way . the only thing i miss from the old version is the silenced revolvers. 

and the dlc improves upon the base game in a lot of ways as well. your choices feel more meaningful throughout. theres more stuff to do . the gigs are way more interesting with fun stories and encounters. the only real problem with the dlc is the fps drops . sometimes it drops to well below 20fps. after the latest patch 2.11 it hasnt ever dropped that low but its gone down to around 25 once in a while. restarting the game seems to fix the fps drops temporarily. in the base game im averaging around 55-60 btw.

the game has been improved a lot compared to launch. the combat is much better. so is the driving. and a lot of the bugs have been fixed. but i still wouldnt call this is a polished game ;)  some side quests still have audio bugs . rn the scanner doesnt seem to scan a good number of dead bodies which im 90% sure wasnt the case before. cars still sometimes spawn falling from the air. the el capitan vehicle stealing missions are currently bugged. no matter what you do a lot them end up failing automatically once you reach a certain distance from the destination. i still cant close the windows in my megabuilding apartment since the romantic hangout. also the radioport seems to stop working for like 2 seconds whenever i start climbing a ladder.

anyway the game is still great and definitley worth playing . the main story missions and 90% of sidequests as well are completely bug free. its got a great story , really good gameplay and phenomenal music. definitely one of the best video game soundtracks ive ever listened to.",1707323454,1707323454,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

There genuinely isn't any environment so rich, believable and yet beautiful. You can be standing anywhere in the vast city looking anywhere in any direction and you will be met with a breathtaking view. Despite this immersion, the game does not compromise on the gameplay level. With update 2.0 the gameplay is transformed into an unbelievably fun and amazing sandbox experience with an astonishing amount of build possibility. You can approach  a 100 people and each would be playing with their own set of guns, cyberware, and perks, a build optimised entirely for them. The combat is fluid and fast, and lets you experiment and enjoy in many ways. I will say there is a lack of difficulty. Even on Very Hard, after level 50 you will become a God with your only concern being how spectacularly can you dispatch the next enemy. While the power is fun, I do wish there was more challenge to the combat other than a couple well designed boss encounters. Finally the story is amazing. Both the base game story and the expansion story are beautifully crafted to deliver real and gripping emotional roller coaster. These stories have had a profound impact on me and I cannot emphasise enough how well executed they are. 
That said I wish to come to my only issue with the game: cut content. The base game is the most affected by this. Megabuildings are the most prominent feature in the skyline and entirely inaccessible in every meaningful manner. The Corporations and gangs are severely atrophied. Even the base game story feels like there was a lot more planned for it and there definitely are pacing issues due to this fact. And it is important to not forget that this game is not an RPG. It is very easy to become lost within V and become a person on the streets of Night City, but other than playing a personality, meaningfully altering the story is missing. This is corrected in the Expansion to great extent though and it is probaly the cancelled content that resulted in a far more linear experience narratively speaking.
Despite it all Cyberpunk 2077 is one of the best games available today to play today, and it absolutely worth playing. It is fun, emotional, thought provoking and immersive.

This time I think I'll just save disk space for ARK dlc or something. Because even ARK has a better story/main questline than this game. Cyberpunk's ""story"" feels like a D&D oneshot that got dragged into a full campaign because the player got side-tracked and bored with the main story. Kinda like Baldur's Gate 3 in all honestly, but at least that game has pretty adequate suspension of disbelief that allows you to enjoy the story... although like Cyberpunk it really makes no sense that you should do anything other than the main quest, at least until you reach aforementioned suspension of disbelief part. Cyberpunk just straight up makes no sense as to why somebody with ONE MONTH TO LIVE would be running around stopping cyberpsychos, buying cars, making money or doing LITERALLY ANYTHING that isn't getting cured(the main quest); because UNLIKE Baldur's Gate 3 you DON'T have anything stopping that month from running out tomorrow.

Cyberpunk 2076 would have been a better game by miles, with the events of Cyberpunk 2077 being either a sequel game or final DLC to you and Jackie's misadventures; instead of having Jackie be wasted on tutorials, a montage and consigned to an easily avoidable death. In addition, having Jackie(and not V) be resurrected by the chip would have been a MUCH better story than the force-fed junk given to us, because now maybe the reason V is doing all of that is to help Jackie by earning enough money or something, instead of being handed the solution on a silver platter and being given LITERALLY every incentive to ignore it and NO reason(beyond roleplay) not to do so.",1707301420,1707301420,False,2,0,0.505988001823425293,0,True,False,False

Now, as of patch 2.11, with the same setup, I am able to achieve 60+ fps average on med-high settings 1440p.

Wonderfully amazing game, by the way. Great animations, especially for all of your possible weapons. Hacking is fucking insane to make builds with, and I haven't even tried a Sandy build yet because that shit is so fun. Cosmetics not having huge stat advantages makes you feel more like the V you want to be in this world. Huge extensive amount of very interesting lore, thanks to Mike Pondsmith. Very fun and engaging DLC too, but I want more. So much more. Keanu's acting still is very lackluster in Phantom liberty tho like wtf we kinda expected the whole ""wake the fuck up, samurai..."" kinda shit in the beginning, but then all we got was a monotone-ass ""i don't care about video games"" Keanu voice, and it feels like they didn't even like tell him to try. Idris on the other hand is a great addition, and he brings a very solid character to life, with most of his voice lines sounding more genuine, being more in line with the other cast. V always has been great, male or female.

Pros:

- Story: 10/10
Judy is almost one of my favourite characters ever in any entertainment medium (anime,games,tv). So the quality of story and writing and characters are amazing

- Side Quests: 10/10
Not a single boring one

- Gameplay: 8/10
Standard Deus Ex Mankind Divided stuff but lesser fleshed out. I really don't like perks that increase few % here and there

- Level Design: 10/10
Night City is amazing (graphics, side quests, traversal by foot/vehicle, verticality)

- Performance (CPU): 10/10
Uses all cores to their max unlike unreal engine nonsense single threaded

Cons:

- Grinding: 6/10 
Not too much is required if you do some amount of side quests(which I highly recommend doing). Then there are GIGs (low quality nonsense just for grinding which if possible you should avoid). I hate these skill trees where additional slots are unlocked or some % / numbers increase. We have to go into menus quite often to do this. And we keep selling junk all the time, in my opinion which is a waste of time

- Enemy/ NPC AI: 6/10
Leaves a bit more to be desired compared to Red dead/ Last of us 2, metal gear solid phantom pain etc.

- Stability: 7/10
Bugs are there, but nothing game breaking  (though I played on 3080 Ti and 6800xt)
They used to really takes you out of immersion but not anymore

- Performance (GPU): 7/10
This is really not optimized for AMD cards for ray tracing which is a shame. They should have had a setting for Ray traced reflections (low, high,medium) like they had for Ray traced Global Illumination. To be fair, for non-ray tracing, they gave lots of options to tweak. Also they were VERY slow to implement FSR 1.0 and FSR2.0 . This game can't run properly without DLSS which is a bit sad, even on highest GPUs with good settings. Also there should be higher texture quality setting for people with more VRAM instead of some pop-ins and in general not so great textures on some people

TLDR: Must play once in your life time. Spend time with it, immerse yourself in it and this game will stay within your heart forever. 


Gameplay: 
 Buggier than Skyrim and still rough around the edges. However, it is very enjoyable and with its good modding capability, you can change many elements of the game to suit your flavour. Even without mods, the game offers many unique play-styles, but there are some strategies which you would definitely want to follow regardless of what you choose for your character. Off the top of my head, the Tech tree is a must have for any build for increasing cyberware capacity, investing in dash and air dash skills in the Reflex tree for greater movements, and break down extra weapons for upgrade components instead of selling them (especially tier 5).


Graphics:
 With the right hardware setup and the game's Ray Tracing and Path Tracing capabilities, its visual is unmatched. With mods, the game can look very close to real life (no exaggeration). As a start, I recommend Nova LUT mod by theCyanideX in Nexus mods.


Sounds:
 Great voice acting, especially by Cherami Leigh who plays female V. I have never felt as sympathetic and attached to a playable, main character as much as female V, if it weren't for her performance and the strong writing. The way she changes her performance as the story progresses to match V's character growth was very good and I believe nobody could play female V as well as she had. The music was also very good and I loved the way the game introduced real bands and singers into the game as fictional bands and singers, with their own backstories and unique interactions. The biggest issues I had relating to the game audio were: poor sound quality from some voice lines, and minor game bugs which cause the audio to become too quiet/loud/silent. The drop in quality of some voice lines was most likely due to some recording sessions not taking place in professional studios during covid quarantine, and it is most notable in the Phantom Liberty DLC.


Writing: 
 The world building and the atmosphere is very rich and unique. It is very easy to lose yourself in it, especially if you like cyberpunk genre. The writing for the dialogues are mostly very good but sometimes, they don't quite make sense, either due to cut content or bugs... Regardless, I thought the issues were minor in comparison to the good. In addition, there are many layers to the stories and the world of the Cyberpunk 2077, which will give you ample opportunities to really dissect and ponder on their meanings.

 Out of all the multiple-choice games I know, no games finish their stories as well as this game has. The ending of a story is the hardest part of creating a great story. This is especially true for games with multiple choices and endings, in which writers often resort to creating simple solutions out of the blue, at the end of the game (i.e. Mass Effect 3, Deus Ex: Human Revolution, and etc.). Many popular films, games and comics have great beginnings and middles but a lot of them fail to give logical, satisfying, memorable, and thought provoking conclusions. Which is why I believe that a good ending is what separates a great story from a good story. 

 Cyberpunk 2077 succeeds in delivering outstanding conclusions from multiple branches of choices. None of the endings felt forced or out of place, and they all meaningfully answer the question that you are being asked, since the start of the game (won't spoil what it is, you will have to figure it out yourself by playing). All of them reflect the choices you/the protagonist make throughout the story and I am sure after you complete the game, you will be thinking about the characters you've interacted with and their world for a long time. The way the game concluded its story is the main reason why it is now my favourite, and I am not sure if I will experience something as profound and good from a video game, again. 

 To anybody reading this, if you can immerse yourself in this game's world, you will have an unforgettable experience that will take you through one of the best emotional roller coasters a game can offer (assuming you haven't spoiled yourself with the plot of the game). Out of all the games I could have played, I am really glad it was this. 

-""Haven't forgotten a thing. Never will"".










OLD REVIEW: Buggier than Skyrim and honestly, I do not want to know just how much worse it was at launch. Still, the game has enjoyable moments and I would recommend it when it's on sale.

It was dogshit incarnate when it dropped, but after patches, Edgerunners, the 2.0 update and the absolute ART that was Phantom Liberty, this is probably my favorite game of all time after Skyrim. Man I simply cannot meatride this game enough. The main story (while kinda scuffed at parts) makes you really FEEL like Keanu Reeves is in your brain. In all seriousness, I've played through this shit so many times and I still don't get bored of it. It's got a massive open world with more immersion than you could ask for, and it's faithful enough to the original pen-and-paper roleplaying games it's based off of that the boomer in you will be eatin' good. It's got guns, titties, weiner if you're a little limp in the wrist and enough side content to keep your ADHD-addled zoomer brain engaged. All this in mind, CP truly is an experience to remember.
If you have a roided-enough PC to run it and 60 dollars, PLAY THIS FUCKING GAME BRUH.

Main Story - 7.5/10 - very good. Nothing absolutely mind blowing but good. 

Phantom Liberty Story - 9/10 - way better than the main story. 

Game Endings - 2/10 - The majority of V's endings are terrible, ruins the vibe and the game. 

Weapons 7.5/10 

Overall Map - 8/10 - The city has a soul. Very immersive. Night City is a beautiful tragedy. 

Characters - 10/10 - They absolutely killed it this one. All characters feel iconic and unique in a good way. 

Main Character (V) - 8/10

Johnny Silverhand - 11/10 - Through the roof. One of the best, if not the best character in a video game. 

Dogtown - 8/10 - Very good but too small. 

Homes - 4/10 - A disappointment. Can only get apartments. Not even a house or a mansion. 

Side Missions Overall - 6/10 - Some are pretty cool I guess. 

Cyberware - 9/10

Skill Tree Overall - 8/10 - There should be more relic skills. 

Police - 7/10

Combat System - 8/10 - Feels fast and nice but lacks a bit of smoothness. 

Music/Soundtrack Overall - 9.5/10 - Samurai carried this one. Never Fade Away is actually good. 

Cars Overall - 7/10 - Weaponized vehicles could be better. Need more, nicer cars. 

Car Customization - 0/10 - Absolutely terrible. Rayfield color changing is all there is, seriously? No modding, no body kits, no good stuff. 

Clothes - 6.5/10 

Romance 6/10 - Can't make love to them when inviting them over, Can't date Judy if your male, can't date Kerry if your female, V should be able to romance any. The players should get what they want. 

Message to Cyberpunk 2077 developers or whoever works on this game: For this game or its sequel, make better endings, better vehicle customization, better romance opportunities, better homes and not just small apartments, and make the game more smooth, especially the combat system. 

Cyberpunk Overall - 7/10

The introductory Part I is great the first time through, but is a little obnoxious if you want to replay the game with a new starting character because it is necessarily restrictive, particularly the hotel main quest sequences. I realize that it has to be for the story, but it is boring on a subsequent play through. Decisions in the game come back to haunt or pleasantly surprise you later and you have little idea at the time that you make them. The vast number of outfits, vehicles, weapons, weapon mods, etc. is staggering and very interesting. The attribute/perk system is much improved in the latest version. The only story issue that I have personally is that most of the endings are real downers. Did they learn nothing from Fallout 3? I don't want to invest hundreds of hours playing a game to come away thinking that it was never going to work out well for the character, no matter what I decided. Too ""Emo"". You would think that there would be some kind of ""happy"" ending to attain. If you decide to do the ""romance"" options, you have only one option for your character and you almost have to read online to determine who that is and how not to screw up the dialogue in order to make things work. Answer a question wrong and many, many hours of game play later, you are missing an option in the dialogue. Like other games, as you level up, you find more great and iconic weapons. Unfortunately, at that point, you don't have much game time left to use them. If you have the Phantom Liberty expansion, try to get to it as early as possible to improve the game equipment in all parts of the city.

I don't think no one will disagree that this game was just a piece of crap when it's released, and even if I like the ""Cyberpunk"" universe I wasn't considering to play it but ""Patch 2.0"" and ""Phantom Liberty"" is one of the best comebacks of the game industry. Could it be better? YES! but it's still one of the best games out there and the best game of CD Project Red for sure.
PROS:
- Amazing story and storytelling, I've never been this close to flatline myself. This shit is depressive and it's really pulling you into itself.
- Amazing visuals.
- Even if there is some minor issues, combat mechanics are pretty good. It'll satisfy your psychotic needs...
- Keanu Reeves.
WHAT COULD IT BE BETTER:
- New Game+ is a must, I want to play the game from the start but I want to play it with my cosmetics, weapons and stuff that I spend 126 hours to collect.
- A speed fixer for vehicles could be really nice.
- Interactions with random NPCs could be improved.
CONS:
- Worse vehicle mechanics than GTA3.
- Your grammar will be damaged for eternity.",1707256075,1707256075,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you haven't played it yet there should be nothing holding you back :-) 

After 320+ hours I can honestly say this is the best game I've ever played. Yes, it was a horrible launch and I had so many crashes but now with all the patches that have come out I've been sucked into this game like nothing else. I did every ending (including the secret one) and now I'm about to do the whole game again as a male V. The combat is so fun and all the different creative ways I can approach a problem can cause anything from sheer comedy to butt clenching mayhem. Don't let anyone tell you that the story isn't deep or the characters are shallow. When I read those reviews I know right away that the reviewer didn't actually play the game. I did every single thing there is to do - I cleared the map until there was nothing - and there are so many tiny nuances to discover about each main character that it staggers the mind to think how they even story boarded it. Thanks CD Projekt Red - can't wait for some DLC.

By the way, let's not even mention the huge modding community that has evolved and how that opens up a whole crap load of new things to do.

[b]The Good[/b]

+ Breathtaking open world city with a crazy amount of content. Taking on jobs that all have unique and interesting lore and story attached, building up reputation that comes with its kinks and establishing relationships all in itself already leave an unforgettable experience. Voice acting, animations, sound design and soundtrack, incredible. It's mesmerizing what has been built here, very impressive considering the scale of this game. It is in every way a technical leap in gaming.
+ Side quests that don’t feel like side quests, because they're on par with the main quests in terms of quality, and don't feel like the usual 'filler' content we're used to in games so big. They're some of the most fun I had in the game.
+ Combat system that resembles Borderlands, and other 'looter' games. There are tons of weapons to play around and tinker with. You can also upgrade your body with all sorts of kinky parts and weapons as well, to discover different approaches to encounters.
+ Character customization is solid. Not only is there really great character creation, you can also change your character during your playthrough at any time, to really personalize your character as you're playing.
+ Great roleplay aspect that really makes the game feel more immersive and responsive to your personal input, thought it's not a true RPG experience so therefore not a selling point. Still the way the dialogue options you choose change how conversations go is satisfying and keeps you engaged.

[b]The Bad[/b]

- The performance, far from a perfect experience, but it is solid enough that most players won’t have major issues. One of the visual bugs I encountered was the rain, it makes the lines of objects jagged and ugly. Though, there is a community mod available to fix that.
- While I do love the sheer amount of content. Trying to do it all can prove occasionally challenging, since the objective may prove to be confusing or buggy.
- [strike]Driving feels sluggish at times. I found myself hitting a bunch of things inside the city because everything felt a bit crammed up.[/strike] Improved in the 2.11 patch all around.

[b]Thoughts[/b]

There is so much content in this game that I could continue to go more in-depth, but I feel like you might have a pretty good idea of what to expect now. The major bugs that were present on launch are pretty much no longer a thing, and you are not left with the feeling of there being more to be desired, it's a very expansive and especial experience start to finish.

Would I recommend it? Yes. This is now a must play. Whilst it does still come with its fair share of issues, the great outways the bad by a lot. [strike]I will update this review when I have finished the Phantom Liberty expansion.[/strike]

The Phantom Liberty expansion, let's talk about it. It's great. Strong narrative, has a more fleshed out and satisfying ending than in the main game, well if you choose the right option. It also adds some nice final touches to other characters' stories. Overall a much worthy playthrough if you enjoyed the main game.

Edit: It's been a few years of massive updates, so I feel I should expand on my review.

This game was phenomenal when it released and has only gotten better. There were a lot of reports of bugs and optimization issues, but I experienced very little of these even on my GTX 1080 that I had at the time. Now, the game has had massive overhauls and content updates since release and it's only improved the experience. Replaying it again for Phantom Liberty, it feels like a different game. The skill system has been overhauled, the combat has been tweaked, mods have been going strong, and that's not even mentioning the mind-blowing narrative of the expansion (which was added on top of an already phenomenal plot). Visuals are breathtaking (especially with ray tracing and LUT mods), performance has significantly improved, and overall gameplay feels much smoother.

Overall, even with the rocky start, CDPR has proven that they care about this game and about their fanbase. Can't wait to see what they have in store for the sequel!",1607727364,1707250828,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

If you dont mind the bugs, i recommend the game without a doubt, since it has some beautiful scenery, a nice story (or at least from what i can get to at this moment) and the progression system is also pretty good since you increase on street creds and it unlocks what you can and cant use, main problem with the game is the gangs and police, since they seem to get angry out of no where sometimes and the police appear like Houdini or something. 
Final conclusion, game is a mess, even though it was announced in 2012, a decent amount of time to make the game, but what came out was a crunched, rushed game that from launch day to now we still have problems. Solid with graphics, story, progression and characters, but buggy, rushed, sometimes unplayable with a sprinkle of magic police men appearing out of thin air.

Vers 2.0 and beyond update

Now considering that the game has recently had a pretty big update all around, i think that i can say that this game is polished enough to the point its a solid recommendation, the police system is a lot better, the way cybernetics works also is much better, even if it got a bit of a nerf (which is still good since being allowed to put as many however you wanted seemed a little too much to me). New options for the apartments, dlc options and more, they all seem like positive changes that make the game a lot better.

It was much more complex and took longer to 'power up' on the old build but had item scaling issues that made them obsolete.  Story was good from the beginning it was just some issues with graphics that seemed under delivered.  The new build is streamlined and much easier for gear crafting and leveling, but seems almost too easy to 'power up' quickly and makes the remaining game barely a challenge.  Overall the changes balanced the game more and stopped making items obsolete within the new system, but having experienced the original intent the clothing serves nearly no purpose anymore.  I find myself using stealth at first for survival, but once leveled and chromed stealth is pointlessly slow unless story driven.  Combat is fast and exciting theme music, vehicle chases are intense, and story has drama of all sorts, so its a great game overall.  Can only lay the foundations for an even better sequel.

CDPR takes Grand Theft Auto's successful open world gameplay loop and combines it with the Witcher game's impressive story telling and narrative design and you are left with cyberpunk 2077. combat and progression systems feel amazing to interact with (a personal negative from Witcher 3). the world and characters make for an unreal level of immersion that i think is really captured by how well the first person camera is done here. there are just so many levels of content to sift through, whether you're a completionist, there for all the hidden lore bits, or just want to shoot gangsters in the face, something is present for everyone. 

cyberpunk is the best kind of game. one where you can tell that the people who created it give a shit. it is a slow burn, and it's of my opinion if you beat it in under 50 hours played you missed out on so much of what it has to offer. a seemingly increase in modding traffic (NexusMods) spells a good future, too. an easier glimpse into seeing if you'd enjoy this game is watching an episode or two of Edgerunners on Netflix. they go hand in hand together very well. 

just remember, in this city you can't miss twice.

10/10 I love this game












In all seriousness, it's really more of a 9/10 because of how many bugs I encountered, but that won't change the fact that Cyberpunk 2077 is out to be one of my favourite games ever. It has a strong story with wonderfully fleshed out characters that left me feeling empty at the end of it all (in a good way). Not to mention, the combat is incredibly fun and visceral once you really get a build going (check [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aceFr4K9D-Y]this video[/url] out). It's just such a superb game that is absolutely worth the asking price, especially if it's on sale.

The Phantom Liberty expansion is phenomenal and easily ranks among Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine. The spy thriller angle they went with for the story was awesome and works really well as a Cyberpunk version of James Bond/Mission Impossible. The new area, while appearing small at first glance, is pretty dense and packed with stuff to do. It's a very good addition if you liked the base game.

As mentioned before, the only real complaint I have are the silly amount of bugs I encountered. It really took me for surprise considering that this game has been out for at least 3 years at the time of writing. I also can't speak for how the game was before the big 2.0 update as I played the game after 2.0 was released. There were so many bugs that I just had to keep a list:

- Got softlocked during [spoiler] 3 [/spoiler] different endings that prevented me from progressing [b](1 of those has been fixed from what I know, but I'm not sure about the others)[/b]
- Your character sometimes appears completely naked for a split second when looking into a mirror (and I do mean completely) before loading your actual outfit 
- Duplicate of my character stood behind me when I was looking in the mirror ([url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3147195871]screenshot[/url])
- Yet another mirror bug where my equipped weapon glued itself to my hand 
- Somehow managed to teleport myself back to a ladder I climbed half an hour ago by drawing my weapon. This just so happened to trigger during a side quest, causing me to receive a very angry text and fail the quest
- Broken melee finisher animations. You only do a slow-mo attack instead of a fancy animation
- Overlapping controls on controller since 2.1 -- sometimes I accidentally read a shard I picked up instead of scrolling down on the loot menu, or I unintentionally turn the radioport on and off when scrolling between security cameras
- Fell through the ground while running once. Thankfully the game saved me from the void by teleporting me back to before I fell
- Hands randomly disappeared when using arms cyberware (like gorilla arms) so I couldn't see my hands when I held a weapon or when I interacted with anything during cutscenes
- Music during hacking minigame disappeared midway through a playthrough
- A random NPC persisted forever floating above the same road and would never fade away from existence even if I drove to the other side of the map. I also encountered a flipped over police car that was doomed to a similar fate until I intervened
- The game continuing to think I was escaping the map's boundaries and then teleporting me every 30 seconds even though I only went out of it once and remained in the boundaries ever since
- Can't loot from certain enemies even though there's an icon showing that they are lootable
- Perks having no effect during an important DLC quest and continuing to have no effect after completing it
- Some lines from a certain character had a filter on them, making them speak as if they were talking through a phone
- Couldn't save or go into a menu after impersonating someone else for a quest
- When stepping into a specific area, the game auto-completed a random side quest that I had never started before, which would've bugged out the rewards for it if I went on to start the actual quest
- Some passive skills were completely broken
- Arms cyberware were downgraded to the lowest tier when loading a save from the 2.01 patch, forcing me to spend materials to upgrade them back to where they were

Don't let this list deter you from buying the game because it is indeed a brilliant game, but do keep in mind that the game is very prone to bugs. Some of these bugs have been fixed since I last played, and hopefully more of them will continue to be fixed as more patches release.",1704603406,1707179791,True,1,0,0.502538084983825684,0,True,False,False

I played cyberpunk sense day one. When I review games, I usually go on the basis of three things. Game-play. Story. Art design and graphics. I'm not going to make this a long review, but a detailed one.

Game-play: 2024 Cyberpunk compared to 2020 Cyberpunk has dramatically changed so much that the game is polished now, and if they had waited a couple more years, the game would have been better, yet releasing it early gave feedback on what the game is now, even if the game came out bad.
The cybernetics, weapons, upgrading, and moments are really good, including the skill tree aspect. Driving can be a little less inspiring yet good enough. NPC are better now, and the choice-making in diolog is still linear but really enjoyable in decisions. The UI has changed and is reasonably great. There are many positive developments in the game-play department that
CD PROJEKT RED is done for the game now.

Story: The story of Night City is sad but happy at the same time, like a bipolar man off and on with his meds. The story is outstanding in my opinion; there are so many different endings that it took me a minute to do all of them. There are lots of quests and side stories to do that have a lot of lore. lots of Easter eggs from the board game as well. I'm not going to spoil it. The story is just good and worth playing.

Art design and graphics: The art and graphics are stunning. The model designs and overall textures are not that bad for a game like this. There are only a couple games other than this that make me immerse myself in the graphics and art design of the game. I'm not saying it's realistic, and you don't need a game to be good-looking to be immersed, but dammm, this game looks amazing. My favorite part is at night, with all the lights from the neon signs and projections. Now the ugly truth. You do need an ""ok"" PC to make the game look good and run decently, sadly. The good part is that, with the latest patch and playing it in 2024, this game runs so much better than ever before.

DLC Bonus: The DLC is fun, worth the $30, and brings more excitement to Night City. This review is only on the main game, but as a bonus, I would say to get it. It's as good as the main story.

Conclusion? Sweet and simple, buy the game. It's fully relaxing and runs well. Buy it on sale and have a good time playing it.",1607584966,1707159805,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

The game world is unbelievably immersive. This game has the best-feeling FPS combat I've ever experienced in an RPG. The writing is incredible. The story is engaging.

I got this game on launch through GOG and the game was ""not so good"".

Now the game is much more complete but still a far cry from the original promise or from what you would expect. they fixed a lot and I applaud them for that. sadly, the game NPCs and how the world reacts to you and everything works is pretty much the same with little effective change.

Yes, you can now ride the NCART and cars have guns... wow. shot in the street and the effect is close to what it was at launch. the world still feels dead. Perk system is less broken now and it feels more like you would expect.

I've got mean comments about my take but suck it up. I've recently re-played some of it with mods and while the game is even better looking with the right mods the overall gameplay and story is still lackluster.

Fans had no patience to wait for this gem of an IP from CD Projekt Red to finish and are the true blame for the company's decision to have this game rushed in bad unfinished state during COVID.

That being said, here is the real verdict after 78 hours of just the base game:

CyberPunk 2077's universe is the true show stealer with it's beautiful tragic story told in a very similiar pace as BladeRunner. as a matter of fact, this game is very much a much more indepth version of BladeRunner if John Wick happened to cross over within that universe. Why did I mention John Wick? Keanau Reeve's plays another character that also never misses a single head shot to a point he is actually in your head now! 

Cyberpunk's gameplay is a typical action RPG with a lot of technical elements that makes it fun for Run and Gunners and Stealth combat. you can hack machines to either distract enemies or insert Viruses in everything to infect them. there's even a hack to make enemies unalive themselves. Sad but deep. Upgrades extend to how you can resolve quests and add more options in choices. there's a lot to explain so I'll just keep it up to here so you can figure the rest out.

Overall, this game redefined the sci fi genre and takes a psychological approach to the universe. 

Game has undergone so many patches to where I can say that it's not a scam to purchase! 
Definitely wait for a sale especially if you wanna get the Liberty City DLC with it.

Music is a BOP ""I Really Wanna Stay At Your House"" has always been on repeat (the Netflix show Cyberpunk Edgerunner is to blame for that).

Very fun engaging game. Paced very beautifully.

Bonus points: it also carries mini games in forms of arcade machines that do get very addicting at times to where you should beat their high scores.

Pros:

Story/Characters 

The story of this game has a very interesting premise, and is then fleshed out by the characters of the game, who are in my opinion the one of the best parts of the game. Creating characters you care about in something like a TV show or movie is hard enough, but in a game? Even rarer. Cyberpunk does it best of all games I've played. Johnny, Panam, Takemura, Judy, Rogue, Jackie, etc etc. I could go on and on. Even V, the player character, has plenty of character and does a good job of being a likeable character in their own right while still leaving room for self-insertion. It's awesome to experience the plot of the game alongside characters who actually have personality. The voice actors and animators do a great job furthering this idea with emotional acting and lots of unique animations, which is a joy to behold in 1st person. The soundtrack also is cool and unique, and really compliments the scenes it is used in, particularly the emotional scenes.

World

Cyberpunk has a massive world rich in detail and lore, and further makes the experience even more immersive alongside the characters and story. You can get lost in this world and feel apart of it very easily. The core story of the game also centres around what makes the world of Night City tick, such as the Arasaka corp., and the characters also represent a wide range of groups of people and affiliations in night city, so experiencing the world is made easy by following the main quest and progressing character focused side quests.

Combat

The combat system is at its core fun and satisfying, with loads of room for build crafting. You could be a super agile cyber-ninja, a walking talking tank, or a Ghost in the Shell-esq hacker who kills their enemies with their mind. The cyberware system is just straight up cool and there are tons of unique weapons and weapon types to chase and spec into if you want.

Choice

The story of cyberpunk is extremely choice oriented. There are multiple different endings which are all very different which can come about from your own decisions. The decisions are also very far reaching: a seemingly smaller decision you made hours ago can come back to bite you in the ass later, which on one hand can be slightly annoying however it makes the game even more immersive. You really have to think about what kind of playthrough you want.

Graphics/Art 

Cyberpunk is a stunning game, albeit not super well optimised compared to some other games. But if you have a system which can run it at minimum on low settings and get a stable 60 fps like me, then the game will still look fantastic. The general aesthetic of the game and the designs of the world, characters, weapons, cars, etc are all well thought out.


Cons

Some of these are a bit nit-picky, be warned

The biggest con to me is probably the AI, which to be honest is still pretty terrible. The police will just spawn police cars out of nowhere during a chase to ram you, the AI just clump together in groups of enemies and slowly walk towards you during combat, if an enemy sees you just before you kill them silently, even if they dont shout or anything before they die, the whole camp then knows you are there, and EXACTLY where you are, and they are all coming to kill you. Same with the police: if you kill one but they dont have a chance to shout or radio or anything before they die, doesent matter, the police are now hunting you.

Janky/buggy

The game, while soooo much better then launch, still feels a bit janky. For example, in melee combat. An enemy swings a melee weapon at you and you dash away at the last second? Guess what, that swing is still locked on to you, and the AI will slide all the way across the room in the same animation to still land the blow anyways. Stuff like that makes things like boxing almost impossible on higher difficulties. Some other things are a bit jank as well, like how if you get hit by a car, there are no rag doll physics, you just get an indentical ugly animation played every time. There are also some bugs in the game. It was rare that it affected my plathrough in any meaningful way, but it is still obvious to me that the foundation of this game was rushed out before it was ready.

Too much choice?

Some of the major story options, such as an ending which lots of players believe to be the best ending, are locked behind seemingly insignificant dialogue which you cant change later. The game sometimes needs to make more distinction between what dialogue will have a massive impact later. Its possible to miss tons of amazing story content and gameplay in the game, and theres no way to go back and experience it unless you got lucky and saved beforehand, or if you start a new game.


But overall this game has come a long way and is now one of my favourite games. If you were put off like the launch like i still was but only a few weeks ago, try the game now and see. Play at least up to the heist mission about 3-5 hrs in, as that's where I was hooked and where the world opens up a bit.

The fact that in this universe the cyberware and human modification have come together and have terms like overheating, optics and others is so cool as a PC builder myself.

Excellent use of sounds and good choice of music and most importantly, REALLY, GOOD, SOUNDTRACKS.

Incredibly clever writing and amazing memorable lines and dialogue

STYLE

Endless Replayability

RPG mechanics with multiple trees and dialogue options that actually matter with multiple different outcomes

Non-repetitive missions

Auto-Save features. This is very important because I like to mess around and choose the right decision you all know what I mean.

Some really good compelling characters and life-like personality!

What I don't like

-The very design of being strictly first-shooter. I have to first get this out of the way I am no means a video game designer, and the developers and designers have the right to have their own vision for how the game should represents. But honestly this is probably the only game that I could complain that it really, really does not work.  From the very first article or news from a tweet that Cyberpunk 2077 is confirmed to be in played entirely in first person view I wasn't happy. At all. In fact, I'm not the only one. Hell, this game felt and plays like a Far Cry clone. So being in first person.. what the hell is the point of character costumization and stylistic clothing?? I can't connect to V if he's never appared in any of the cinematics or scenes at all. First person shooter games are good for silent protagonists but not for our boy or gal talkative V it just doesn't work! You can drive vehicles around in third person with press of a button, so why the hell can't atleast have third person cam whenever V falls down or gets ejected out from vehicles? The game felt very awkward 

-Bugs. 3 years, one revive and a show later and somehow, this game still has some bugs left but not game breaking, I mean obviously not as terrible as the launch. Some animations don't work, some NPCs just straight up be standing on air, enemies oddly mispronounces the player.. lol. there was one time i was standing near a car and once the NPC got into the car it exploded right in front of me for no reason at all but it was still pretty hilarous. Another ""bug"" happens often but whenever I hit the button to call my personal vehicle most of the time it'll appear on above the highways far from where I'm standing on. The worst part is the vehicles I'm driving on sometimes does not respond to the keys. There are few instances of pop-ups of NPCs and other objects appear on screen and disappearing said objects and NPCs. There is STILL NPCs can T-Pose! But not as often but sitll.

-Brain dead AI. Not all but sometimes the NPCs just stand there even if you're detected and won't attack you, sometimes they're restritected into their own space and sometimes they T-Pose.

-No build up to the plot, poor or lack thereof explanation of things like gangs like Tyger Claws or Maelstorm.

-Story felt very rushed. Not even 5 minutes atleast in my play through of corpo into the game and you're already having a montage with X on how you're becoming known gangster around Night City. I felt X died too early and I hated it. 

-Mundane parts like the BD sequences needs to go. away.  Atleast a skip button.

-Needs QoL improvements like renaming save files, how the HELL does this game does not have the aim toggle option???

-Broken physics. Car and bike physics felt much to be desired.

-Plenty of cut content. I always have trouble believing of what happened in the first 15 minutes of beginning of corpo path because it felt rushed and turns out? There's whole ass cut content behind it that led to this that apparently almost EVERYONE chose this life path have been butchered just like that. Sure almost all games have cut content but Cyberpunk desperately needed that corpo path mission specifically. Like I said, everyone is in disbelief and confused once they've chose that path and after 10 minutes left disappointed.

-Mediocre gameplay. It's essentially first person shooter masked with little bits of RPG mechanics like dialogue and skill system, and hacking to hide the fact its nothing more than a first person shooter, yes it has mechanics you'd expect in an fps nowadays like sliding but theres this one redditor that described it perfectly; jack of all trades, master of none.

-Despicible characters. I loved V, Johnny, Jackie, River and few these guys did phenomal acting and others however there are characters in this game that come and went abruptly. For example, there's a hotshot named Meredith where you can speak to as an option then never seen her again? Unfortunately both love interest are so despicable in Cyberpunk namely Judy and Panam. They both needed your help constantly and whine like you owe them something but never stop and ask you, as V's plan or have conversation same goes for Claire.

-Terrible driving and bikes. I feel the vehicles in this game are not as precise as I thought it would be. Driving vehicles in this game felt they weight more than a freight train and plays unresponsively.

-Is EXTREMELY linear. Unfortunately Cyberpunk 2077 suffers a lot from having limitations, less freedom in an open world games. I have encountered many different issues where you can't drive around in specific areas like the markets areas, the game literally stops you from getting into areas you haven't unlocked yet, there are some cars like the gang cars you can't drive.

-Not very memorable missions or game in general. Unfortunately right after your best friend died is the moment where the game became repetitive jumbled mess with going after Arasaka and then crying that you, as V might not live for very long and I dont mean that as pro your-best-friend character, but literally I don't find anyone else compelling, or relatable, or memorable in any way.

6\10 
Do I recommend this game? Nah, there's plenty of great alternatives imo. But is it great game worth playing? Ehhhh..
honest to God this game is not special that reinvent the whole of anything in any way, this game has great flashes and sight to see in the outside like the cinematics\cutscenes, but fails to deliver the GAME experience, but it is no means a bad game I would never deny the fact it's a polished game to the MAX, I can't in good faith give it a negative review, because unlike many others nowadays, this one was made with actual love, talent, effort and content. lotsa... lotsa content.

Cyberpunk, as a genre, hasn't been fully realized in a videogame--until now.

Back when this game first came out, I disregarded it as another buggy failure from money-hungry businessmen. The usual kind of AAA garbage. It's not. 

2077 is the first game I've ever played that does a good job of putting me in the kind of world William Gibson conceived of in Neuromancer. The attention to detail, slang, vistas, story concepts, and overall atmosphere are almost perfect. The game is almost worth that alone. But is it any good as a game? Yeah, mostly. Naturally you have hacking which is kind of like magic. I would approach a group of enemies, spread a damage over time ability, make the toughest one commit sudoku, prevent another one from seeing, and go in with my shotgun to clean up the mess. Stealth is well-rewarded and seems encouraged in the majority of cases, but I don't have time for that. Still though it's worth mentioning there's a robust suite of stealth-friendly abilities.

Story wise the game does what good cyberpunk should do. Keanu's acting is superb in this. I've always considered Johnny Mnemonic his best acting role, and this is about on par with that. The issue is I'm not so sure I like that character. It isn't that it's a bad character. It's just it doesn't leave much room to disagree with him. In the end he's your moral compass. If you do something he disapproves of, you made the wrong choice. If you do something he agrees with, you made the right choice. I was annoyed with him chiming in on everything to the point where my rebellious nature kicked in and I mostly did the opposite of what he said, barring any obvious betrayal. 

[spoiler]I ended up with the worst possible ending. I went corpo because I envisioned myself as part of the dystopia, not a reaction to it. So in the context of a cyberpunk story, I'm either neutral or an anti-hero. My thought that was by ""siding with"" Arasaka, I'd end up taking my boss's place and we'd probably return Keanu to his body or he'd dissipate into the ether of cyberspace with his girlfriend happily ever after. Instead, I was treated to a lengthy dissection of my version of V as a character and cast into the numinous great beyond while old man Arasaka became a god. All that work, and I don't get to achieve godhood, or at least get my old job back?[/spoiler]

The key takeaway, or caution, about the story in this game is that you don't have as much choice as it leads you to believe. The dialog options are more like ""What line would you like V to say next?"" and not ""There's a fork in the road--which way are you going?"" That said, all of it is done reasonably well, even though it kinda feels like you're a character in Keanu's story, not the other way around. It's a good thing Johnny is such a well-done character. But I can't help but wonder, why not just make Johnny the main character for fuck's sake?

Still, it should be emphasized that despite you having less control over your destiny than the game would have you believe, AND despite that all the possible endings are mix-ups of similar things, all of which end up a bummer/cliffhanger...Cyberpunk 2077 still has a serviceable story. And if you like stories, and you like cyberpunk, this game is worth your money.

Update: Just downloaded the 2.11 patch. At some point they also revamped chracter progression, and overall the game feels better to play. I stick with the basic idea of my old build: hacking to get control of an area, then go in with a shotgun and clean up. Although at this point I don't have a choice because I can't respec again. Whatever, some games choose to go with forcing permanent choices, and this is one of those. I ended up getting the ability to dash and air dash, which is too much fun to not use. I also put some points into katanas, which is kinda redundant because my short range combat is already handled by my shotgun. Whatever, blocking bullets with a katana is cool. I wish they'd change how the mission tracking works. It keeps defaulting to the latest one in my log, but I'm trying to clear out all the gigs before I start with Phantom Liberty. This will also help me come to grips with the mechanics and get some weapons tailored to my playstyle.

Oh and lest I forget, we now have full DualSense support. It's cool because the RGB will flash red/blue when the cops are after you. You can hear radio shit in the little speaker. I don't know if I'm totally on board with the haptic feedback because it seems unnecessarily stiff, but maybe I'll get used to it or there's an option.",1675049100,1707106990,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

OMG where do I even begin to write a review to describe this DLC, I'll start by saying I've put more hours of pure joy, engaged stimulating gameplay into this DLC than I have on some major AAA tile games, that statement alone is a huge compliment.
I would give this DLC 11/10 alone & 22/10 including the base game and a double thumbs up! 

Well done Dev's what you have created is a true masterpiece and 113 hours or my life you can happily keep <3

The price tag for this is absolutely worth it and you get way more than you would expect, I mean an extra 40+ hours easily, NO!! brain dead fetch quests or pointless stunt jumps to increase play time, Just pure story quests, a couple of collectables, 10 more character levels, new cars, multiple endings, a whole new map area + more.

Almost! While Cyberpunk 2077 has improved a lot since it's launch and most of the promised features are here, the open-world immersive sim that we were led on to believe it would be is still not here; What is here, however, especially with the DLC included (Which adds a very good side-campaign and very fun new area to get lost into with great side-quests), is a phenomenal open-world action game with some RPG mechanics.
The open world gameplay is something to write home about, with no real dull side-content; The level design of the city you'll be playing in (Night City) is amazingly fun and intuitive with something to discover around every corner. The city feels very much alive and you can interact with a lot of things. Sure the NPC's don't have any advanced schedules if you follow them around and there is a lot of set dressing. But in the moments you're walking or driving through, everything feels great.
A lot of thought went into the story and lore of the world and it oozes atmosphere. The slang people talk in this game is catchy as well.
I sometimes feel like there is a bit of a clash between the seriousness of the main story and the overly colourful and goofily advertised open world, but I think the devs did this to get a point across about our world as well.
It's still not a perfect game and there are some NPC interactions that I wish were more fleshed out, the story sometimes clashes with the things your main character is capable of doing which can break immersion a bit and sometimes the AI is rather silly, especially when driving; But there is a lot of fun to be had here, the vibes and style of the world suck you right in and some of the main characters are a good time to witness.
The combat, which in the end is the bread and butter of the game is very customisable and there are a lot of diffrent playstyles to specialise into. You can become a stealth master and never even have to touch a gun anymore or go in with your bare hands and everything inbetween; The cyberware you can install and the diffrent perks really make a difference and there is a lot of fun to be had, even with the side-quests which offer a lot for any playstyles; Though the non-DLC ones can become a bit repetative.
Either way:

Initially hesitant due to the infamous launch issues, I decided to wait until the game achieved stability. Once I delved into Night City, I was captivated by its immersive atmosphere. The neon-lit streets, gritty characters, and futuristic setting created an engaging environment.

The storyline, admittedly, started off at a slower pace, but it truly hit its stride after the tower mission. The narrative picked up speed, unveiling a captivating and thrilling adventure that kept me hooked. The game's depth and complexity became more apparent, showcasing the attention to detail that CD Projekt Red is known for.

However, no journey in Night City is without its glitches. Despite post-launch patches, a few bugs persisted, occasionally disrupting the otherwise seamless experience. I couldn't help but yearn for a more polished interface and dialogue system akin to Red Dead Redemption 2, which excelled in immersing players in its world.

Despite these minor drawbacks, Cyberpunk 2077 offers a remarkable gaming experience, especially if you can overlook the occasional hiccup. If you're willing to explore a vibrant and chaotic future, I highly recommend giving it a shot now that the game has stabilized.",1707085273,1707085273,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h2]The Good[/h2]
The gunplay is satisfying, the melee is ALSO very satisfying (having BOTH is a rare thing in games!), the story is good, the gameplay feels good. The movement is strong, impactful and actually meaningful in completing missions. The DLC is very good. Build diversity is very high, you can play this game however you want and almost any weapon/skill combination that is fun to play is also very [i]strong[/i] to play. RP potential is high.

While the game's story is mostly linear, there are definitely a couple of meaningful story and gameplay choices that caught me off-guard. I was pretty amazed when I took up arms against a faction that didn't sit right with me, and the game actually [i]let me do it.[/i] Most other games would have railroaded me into gritting my teeth and make me keep helping them. Many games would lock you into dialogue until you choose the obvious dialogue option that basically says ""*Fight!*"". This game lets you just draw first. The agency that this game gives you without feeling like locking you into binary choices is very well-done and extremely refreshing, despite the fact that the story is [i]somewhat[/i] linear. Don't expect a deranged amount of branching paths like you would find in Mass Effect or Dragon Age, of course.

Game's soundtrack is also good and fits the mood of the game.

The life paths do a very, very good job of adding RP potential to the game. They don't add much gameplay-wise, but it's that bit of extra flavor that really makes your character stand out.

The difficulty in this game is excellent. There is a difficulty selector that you can change pretty much any time. The harder difficulties are PROPER hard.

[h2]The Bad[/h2]
The player's ""life path"" could [i]maybe[/i] have been a little more impactful in terms of how quests, the story or even the gameplay plays out. It usually amounts to small dialogue options and sometimes a ""shortcut"" into an alternate quest path/dialogue tree that you would normally need a skill check for to reach. The intro sequence you get based on your background is at most 30 minutes long, and it quickly all combines into the same ""main path"".

The game should make it a little clearer that trying to be a ""jack of all trades"" doesn't work. I had friends warn against me trying this, so I didn't try. Instead, I focused mainly on 2 big attributes and their skilltrees, and only took small dips in the other skilltrees for things like extra cyberware capacity.

Because of how the game's skill scaling works, dialogue checks are not absolute values, they do not require a specific Cool or Body or Intelligence level. Rather, there are ""Easy"", ""Normal"" and ""Hard"" check levels built-in, and the requirements for each of them increase as you level up.

This means that you can find doors leading to an alternate path that requires Body 7 to force-open. You're Body Level 6. So you dip 1 extra point into Body so you can force these doors more easily. But now your character level is higher, and suddenly [i]the same door[/i] requires Body 8 to force-open, leaving you behind the curve. This felt weird to me.

Again I don't consider this design decision an issue, and I think the developers definitely intended it to be this way. I just wish they had made it a little more clearer that you shouldn't try to ""spread out"" your points. If I had to say ONE bad thing about this game, it would be that they don't make this clear enough.",1707070595,1707070595,True,1,0,0.442028999328613281,0,True,False,False

أعجبني ✅

• القصة رهيبة فيها الكثير من المنعطفات الغير متوقعة وتجربة قصصية لم أعش مثلها من قبل.

• الشخصيات كتابتها ممتازة وبعضها أيقونية والحوارات في اللعبة مكتوبة بعناية.

• ما مليت من كلام الشخصيات أثناء الحوارات وأختيار المحادثات وذلك لأن طريقتها رهيبة فالشخصيات تتفاعل وتتحرك ويتغير المشهد بشكل مستمر.

• إستديو CD PROJECT RED صنع واحد من أكثر عوالم الألعاب المستقبلية جمالاً وبنفس القدر عالم بائس كئيب، وحشية العالم والطبقية العنصرية وغيرها من الأمور التي جسدها الاستديو في عالم اللعبة.

• رسومياً Cyberpunk 2077 هي أجمل لعبة لعبتها في حياتي، لن اطيل الكلام هنا لانه لا يعطي اللعبه حقها رسومياً.

• في بداية اللعبة كان أسلوب اللعب عادي مثل أي لعبة إطلاق نار ولكن مع التقدم في اللعبة فاجأتني بتقديم طرق جديدة للعب مثل القدرات البدنية والقفز مرتين ونظام مهارات أعطاني حرية اختيار طريقة لعبي المفضلة، وحتى قيادة المركبات فيها خواص جديدة يمكن إضافتها والقتال وأنا في المركبة وغيرها.

• عدد كبير من الأسلحة وطرق القتال وتنوع كبير في اللعبه فتقدر تعيد اللعبه وتغير أسلوب اللعب وتجدد وتنوع في خيارات القصة.

• طريقة تقديم بعض الشخصيات في القصة الأساسية وتقدر تكمل قصتهم في المهمات الجانبية وتعرف عنهم اكثر وترابطها مع القصة الرئيسية.

• تنوع المهمات شيء رهيب وأنا جلست ألعب مهمات جانبية كثير ومستواها ممتاز واللعبه فيها تنوع رهيب وفي مطاردات ومهمات اكشن وقتالات ومهمات هادئه وغيرها.

لم يعجبني ❌

• التفاعل مع العالم محدود فمجرد تحاول تتفاعل مع شخصية جانبية ينكشف غطاء العالم وينكسر الاندماج، أحبطتني اللعبه في تفاعل العالم مع بعضه او شخصيتي V.

• الذكاء الاصطناعي يعاني من مشاكل القدرة على القتال فمرات كثير يكون معلق او يتحرك بدون هدف. 

• واجهت مشاكل تقنية لم تكن كثيرة لدرجة افساد التجربة ولكنها مزعجة مثل تعليق اللعبة (جهازي مجهز باحدث القطع) ومشاكل في الترجمة تتداخل مع بعضها، وبعض المشاكل في المهمات والأخطاء التقنية.

يحتاج تحسين ⚠️

• نظام إختيار حياة سابقة لشخصية من 3 خيارات كعضو مؤسسات أو من الشوارع والرحال كانت محبطة وما قدمت شيء يستاهل.

• الحوارات الخاصة التي تتطلب مهارات عالية أو قدرات معينه ما تساهل حقيقة وتمنيت شيء أحسن.

• قتال بعض الزعماء محبط نوعاً ما ومافي تنوع كبير مثل المهمات واللعبه بشكل عام، هو صحيح ما حسيت إنها سلبية كبير ولكن لازم تتحسن في الأجزاء القادمة.

ملخص رأيي 🔖

لعبة Cyberpunk 2077 قدمت لي تجربة فريدة من نوعها ومتميزة بقصتها وعالمها الرهيب، وفاجئتني بأسلوب اللعب المميز.

Cyberpunk 2077 is a based from the Tabletop RPG Cyberpunk 2020 (1988) and later Cyberpunk Red (released in 2019) created by Mike Pondsmith. The game deals with dark and mature heavy  story and themes.  There is a ton to do and a lot to see. although you can buy TONS of cars there isnt as much in terms of apartments. But you still get free ones as you progress in the story. Still each district of Night City is detailed differently from district to district.

This is probably one of the most immersive experiences I've had. The first person view makes the game feel so much more authentic, and the first few hours when everything is new are magical. Overall, the atmosphere of this game is its strongest part, you really feel like Night City is a real place, and you are a part of it.

The combat gets better and better as the game goes on. For the first few hours it is kind of mindless and uninteresting, and as you level up you get access to toys that make it very satisfying. The problem is, by the time you feel powerful and the fun is at its peak, the game ends.

This is an immensely detailed and enormous open world, that you could get lost in for hours, but the main story is frustratingly short. You are supposed to do side missions in between the main missions, which are generally high quality, but even with these the game just ends way too early. There are also filler copy-and-paste missions, which are, bar the cyberpsycho sightings, not worth the time. It's not that the game is short, but it feels short, because there was so much more potential in this huge and polished world.

The side missions are good, especially the ones where the game does not take itself seriously. The side characters range from fully fleshed out and well-written to intolerably annoying and cliché. 
The main story is over with a snap of a finger, and could have used an extra chapter, but it is engaging while it lasts. Keanu's performance is amazing, and he really carries the game on his shoulder.

Now for the bad part: the driving, even with a controller, is horrendous. Every car is either horribly understeery, or uncontrollably oversteery. I found myself using the fast travel option a lot more because of this. Compared to something like GTA, its just plain old bad.
After a while, the ""role-playing"" element fades, and it is hard to take the emotional moments of some side stories seriously. You basically become godlike in terms of power, but no one actually acknowledges it. 
The bugs that made this game famous on its release are mostly patched, and the remaining ones are more funny than annoying. I encountered one scripting bug throughout the whole game, but all in all I was positively surprised about how polished the experience was. 

I wouldn't pay full price for it, but I definitely would recommend buying it on sale. It is solid fun, even if it has its flaws.

EDIT with Phantom Liberty:

Fixes most of my issues with the game ending early. Probably the best content this game has to offer, tightly packed and fun. Really unoptimized compared to the rest of the game though. Must play.",1705783384,1707052470,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I am happy to see the outcome of the game itself.
I withheld to give this game a review since I originally didn't think that it would be able to pull of a quasi-No Mans Sky revival.
Yes its healthy to have scepticism originally when this game first released to the market 3 years ago. I thought the game would immediately be thrown to the wayside but after hearing news of the team doing their best to make this game good I finally gave it a chance.
(I don't count this game 4 years old until it reaches December itself)
I wholly recommend this game.

It isn't the best game ever made, and it isn't as well made as Witcher 3. BUT... I love this game! It is so much fun! With the amount of hours that I have played, it is clearly one of my favorite games of all time. I love that the graphics can scale from a Steam Deck to beyond a 4090. I will probably be checking this game out every time I buy a new GPU and I will probably get sucked into playing the game a different way than last time.

Cyberpunk doesn't really have a Good/Evil moral system. That is a weakness and that means that decisions don't feel as diverse as other games, but almost every mission does have a choice that does change if someone lives, dies, likes, or hates you. The positive is that decisions feel more natural to choose between.",1607698998,1707046688,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The posibilities that may happen like augmenting a human body or connecting your conciousness to a network. Well in Cyberpunk, that's where you experience all those kind of stuff. 

I bought this game on the day of release and instantly fell in love. Set in fictional city in USA, NightCity. This ''never give up'' story with an unexpected outcome is something that can influence one life. It is very moving and depressing at the same time. There is also addition for the story in form of Anime CyberPunk Edgerunners.
The combat in this game is great. The variety of playstyles is countless. From gun blazing and going wild, to being sneaky and undetectable. Along the journey, you will encounter a bunch of quests which are made great, there is passion in each and one of them. Graphics are phenomenal aswell as the audio-composure.

On the other hand, the driving model is OK, and what I mean is that it works, it just works. And also can't forget about the bugs on the release (note: Most of them are fixed and the game is in great shape now).

In conclusion, I reccomend this game to anyone who likes very fast combat and very compeling and moving story. I think a lot of people can find enjoyment in this game as well as I did.",1707042897,1707042897,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game-breaking bug that I've come across where you cant use or equip your weapons after completing certain quests/missions. The only way to reverse the bug is to either sleep with one of the joy-toys or put all of your inventory into storage (your trunk) and take it out again. Even then there's no guarantee it'll work. I've also learned that this bug has been a problem since the game's release in 2020. I'm posting this review in 2023... You'd think they would have patched it by now, but no... I've heard that people have had to restart their play-throughs because of this issue. 

The game can be a buggy mess at times but still pretty damn fun overall. Reminds me of GTA - but cyberpunk and with actually good, fun, shooting mechanics. There's also RPG elements to the combat - which means skill trees. Which I absolutely love. I will recommend with caution - especially if you have and older PC, but definitely worth it if you catch it on sale like I did.  :)",1702709321,1707041433,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I never encountered a game breaking bug, just some visual glitches, and as people have noted the DLC is poorly optimized.
The life path options in dialogue really helped with the flavor.
Cyberware is great. First character went 20 in tech and int, mid/end game I could drop 5-6 baddies in 1 in game second.
With that said I was very sad that I had to regear and replay the ending cause the last boss is pretty much immune to hacking.
And the city...beautiful but empty.
I really enjoyed walking/driving around but after awhile not as much. Their is little to do outside of the quest you are given, you wont find an interesting side mission unless directed to it by the game either directly or semi indirectly like when they put a side mission steps away from a main missions pathing.
That said each quest is detailed and well written, it's easy to get caught up in and the dialogue options don't feel contrived but I was left wanting more from certain npcs.

1st playthrough about 90 hours. Hard - Corpo - Stealth Hacker Glass Cannon female voice/body [spoiler]dated Judy and got the harsh Corpo whimp ending[/spoiler]. 
2nd about 10 hrs. Easy - Nomad - 20 Str Face Punch Male voice/body (skipped most dialogue and quests. I just wanted to [spoiler]date Panam and get the Nomad ending[/spoiler]. 
Starting 3rd playthrough on Very Hard difficulty as Street Kid male body/female voice [spoiler]but I found out you have to be male both to date Kerry[/spoiler]. . Plans to do everything and [spoiler]the secret ending[/spoiler].

If anything this game makes we want to play Shadowrun or another cyberpunk themed ttrpg.

This game crashes more than drunks on holidays and the auto save feature doesn't account for how frequently the game crashes. This causes you to start over at the last save point; if you're lucky. I've saved before a crash and had to go back to save points to get around a crash loop. Auto save quits at times and manual save won't work; frequently saving will warn you so you can restart before you progress too far. This is frustrating because this game isn't stable and it's like four years old. There are so many bugs that cause you to lose game play and time. 

Overall I like the game but I just turn it off when it crashes so I don't play too much anymore. The game is alright. There is plenty to do with main missions, side quests, random baddies biding their time. Lots of weapons, different types of weapons, upgrades, weapon upgrades, outfits, and ways to make the story your own. Voice acting is pretty damn good as well as the story.

The best thing about it is probably how well its writing is. You'll probably like it even more if you, like me, are not the biggest fan of capitalism.
The biggest drawback is probably the amount of unpolished parts. During a playthrough, you will probably meet a few bugs of the frustrating kind even after CDPR spammed bugfixes for the last few years and even if they somehow fixed all bugs, most of the game mechanics were half-assed from the start.
Also, to come back to the positive aspect, if you, like me, don't like capitalism, buying this game is kind of hypocritical.

In more gameplay related things the shooting feels good all the guns feel different and the smart weapons are really interesting, the hand to hand combat is terrible though, I think even the the witcher 3 with it's mediocre hand to hand combat was better. The meele weapons however feel good not crazy good but still, It's important to highlight that this game is an rpg not an fps so it's no doom either still I think they really hit the nail in balancing both the rpg and the fps aspect an that's not an easy task, I would've preffered a more complex rpg system but that is just nickpicking

RECIPE TIPS
FREEZING THE BISCUITS
If you’ve frozen the biscuits, take them out and arrange them on a lined baking sheet. Once defrosted, pop them in a medium oven 190C/170 fan/gas mark 5 and heat for 2-3 mins to crisp up. Don’t leave them too long or they’ll dry out.
STORING DOUGH
You can keep the uncooked dough in a sealed container in the fridge for up to two weeks. Simply take some out, dollop on a lined baking tray and allow to come up to room temperature for 5 mins before baking",1707007330,1707007330,True,0,1,0.467032968997955322,0,True,False,False

You know the rest, it was all badly optimized and buggy, it barely ran on my computer and already had glitches on the character creation screen... Decided to refund it.

Now, about 3 years after the release, I've started playing it again and I don't regret waiting. After the many hotfixes, performance optimizations, the advent of AI upscaling technologies like AMD FSR and anti-lag solutions like Nvidia Reflex it is possible to play it even on the same hardware I had back in 2020, that has a GTX 960. Through my recent gameplays I've encountered no derogatory bugs.

It has been one of the greatest gaming experiences I've ever had. I honestly don't think it is perfect, but still, Cyberpunk 2077 has beautiful graphics, a breathtaking level design, a well written lore, a good soundtrack, lots of amazing characters and great mechanics. Overall, it is a very preem game, chooms!

The game's story is excellent (the highlight of the game), I really liked the characters' secondary missions, a strong point compared to other games in which the secondary missions are extremely boring.
The talent tree system is interesting, however the combat is too simple and lacks difficulty, even playing on the last difficulty the combat isn't painful.

The ambience and atmosphere of the game is incredible, the city, the lighting, the sounds, everything there really makes you feel like you are in a cybernetic and futuristic city, a great option for those who like this theme and want to feel immersed in this world.

Alright, listen up, choombas! This game had all the hype, all the expectations, and let me tell you, it delivered in some ways, but fell short in others.

First off, Night City. This place is a damn masterpiece. The neon-soaked streets, the towering skyscrapers, the gritty back alleys - it's everything you'd expect from a cyberpunk world. The atmosphere is spot on, and it truly feels like you're living in a dystopian future.

Now, let's talk about the story. CD Projekt Red tried to weave an epic tale of rebellion and corporate greed, and they did a decent job. But there were moments where the pacing felt off, and some plot lines didn't get the attention they deserved. It's like they tried to cram too much into one game, and it suffered because of it.

Gameplay-wise, it's a mixed bag. The gunfights are intense, the hacking mechanics are solid, and the character customization is top-notch. But there were some bugs, glitches, and AI issues that took away from the overall experience. It's like trying to jack into the Net with a faulty interface - frustrating as hell.

Look, Cyberpunk 2077 had the potential to be a game-changer, a true legend in the gaming world. And while it falls short in some areas, it still manages to capture the essence of the cyberpunk genre. It's a flawed gem, but a gem nonetheless.

So, if you're willing to overlook some rough edges and dive headfirst into Night City, give Cyberpunk 2077 a shot. Just remember, it's not perfect. Stay rebellious, chooms!

0/10


########## Prior to patch 2.11#################
Yes they did the impossible, they fixed the game and it's much better than what I have played 2 years ago.

Pros:
1. They really nailed the details of the night city. Here u can hide bodies in the trash, 
open car trunks, RIDE A RAIL TRAIN AND ACTUALLY STAND UP WHEN RIDING IT

2. Driving experience is improved. Different cars feel drastically different to handle 
and I'm actually having fun driving cars around now instead of just fast travel.

3. Cops are crazy. Tried multiple times but got killed b4 reaching highest police alert level.

4. On retrospective, the story is very good. My 2.5th run now and I just realized how many details
they hid in the story to let you appreciate the ending more.

5. Got randomly jumped by gang bangers and they can actually kill u very easily. 2 years ago the
game wasn't this hard and I like it.

6. Lots of mods out there for this game.

7. They made the inhaler a skill with CD instead of just consumables. 2 years ago I had to stock
these inhalers up b4 going to a big boss fight and they made the fight so easy. Now I actually
had to try more than 1 time to beat a boss.

8. Bosses are harder. There is this high testosterone woman right and she beat my ass up. Let me
tell u I can't even remember her in my 1st run coz she was like weak af. Now I have PTSD
remembering how she charged like a fucking bull into me during the fight.

Didn't play the DLC yet but heard it's a banger.

Cons:
1. NPCs were mocked as zombies 2 years ago now though they are greatly improved, but at some part
of the city you still feel like those are zombies. One time I saw an NPC standing in the middle of
the road taking a phone call and it was very out of the scene. So I drove away his sport car and
crashed it.

2. Upgrading weapons requires a little bit of too much materials. Half story in and I was only able
to upgrade like 2-3 weapons let alone crafting new ones. I'm sure there is a mod out there to
fix it though.

Yeah not many cons here. Great game, 10/10. Try the game before u die.

BIG DISAPPOINTMENT

+1 Graphics
+1 Night City is pretty cool

-10 Story is trash
-5 Werid bugs everywhere


### Night City
Overall quality is pretty good. The environment is immersive except those machine like pedestrians.

### Characters
I don't get it why the game adds so many 60+ yo characters in the game. I mean yeah story-wise they becoming old makes sense, but seriously every main mission you gonna stare at some wrinkled face for the entire time.

### Story
The ending is so trash that I couldn't even bring myself to do another run.

The ending makes you feel so stupid as everything you did is pointless. It's like a black hole and no matter how much MC struggles it's gonna suck you in anyways.

Worst ending ever, not gonna lie.",1607722230,1706984594,False,0,0,0.502168416976928711,0,True,False,False

AND WHAT DID I GET
An empty town,T-posing,lifeless NPCs,a great gameplay hiding somewhere ,which appears sometimes,bugs ,LOT OF BUGS,AFTER 4-5 YEARS ,LOT OF BUGS,like you can't walk an inch in NC without encountering at least 5 problems,cars moving like crazy ,pedestrians not knowing their placement in the world,it's a complete mess,like I thought they fix this stuff ,that's why they had the audacity to make a definitive edition out of it,but no,and lets not forget that this lacks interactions,things to do etc,like I had more fun in the first hour og GTA IV  than I had in 5 hours of this game ,and GTA IV is 12 years older than this game,like I don't understand ,this is the future of videogames?
This game kept on dissapointing me the more I played and I don't think I'll give it a change in the future ,is just out of this world that a broken game to be still broken after 4 years and still be marketed as a Definitive Experience,like I'm looking at Assassin's Creed Unity which had lots of glitches and a desastruous launch ,I played it and did not encounter a single glitch ,A SINGLE GLITCH CD PR 
So for that reason ,I'll just play the witcher series and nothing else for them ,BUT IF THEY DO THE SAME WITH THE NEXT WITCHER GAMES ,THAT'S IT ,I GAVE UP ON THIS COMPANY

[H1]So what's it about?[/H1]
CP:2077 is an open world action RPG with multiple paths. The setting of Night City is huge and looks absolutely amazing. Night City is ruled by corporations and there is a huge rift between the haves and have-nots. In a way it's back to the Dark Ages as the Internet as we know it no longer is available and information is broken up, in another way it's more advanced than nowadays with nearly everyone having their bodies modified with 'chrome'.

 The story telling is excellent and you will notice that many seemingly unrelated events, missions and details are all pieces of the puzzle. [SPOILER]But be warned this is a dark story with no happy ending.[/SPOILER]. There are multiple endings and with different backgrounds of your character and different romantic partners depending on your gender there is the option for replay ability.

[i]Warning: this game is not for the faint of heart - there are some seriously disturbing (side)quests.[/i]

[H1]The good [/H1]
[olist]
[*]The city looks amazing with so many details, side quests, vehicles and multiple routes to take on your adventure. Just looking at the commercials, TV shows and mini games makes me wonder how much time was spent - every time you start the game you discover something new. There are so many small details to discover - a NPC transfers money to you using their neural interface? You'll see their eyes light up while they are using their tech. 

[*]CP2077 goes for full immersion with a tactile approach to the environment and no loading screens (except when you start the game or use fast travel). This works very well and gives the game an experience that most other games have not achieved yet.

[*]There is a good tutorial to learn how to take down enemies, how to perform stealth and hacking operations and in general how the systems in the game work.

[*]The music and sound effects are amazing. The music is also dynamic bringing atmosphere to each scene. It's done really well. 

[*]The story is really good - and the side quests offer a more in-depth perspective in this reality. 

[*]You can craft better weapons and attachments using items you find and bought in the world. There is an extensive range of shops available and the amount of crafting options is stunning: weapons, cyberdeck, implements, attachments and more. Then one day you discover there are weaponised cars: rocket launchers, machine guns, an upgrade that allows you to move faster or jump higher so you can play parcourse in the city and more.

[*]I like that after the pro-logue you can do basically anything: you want to dive in the main story? Then go ahead. You want to do a lot of side quests? Then that's fine too. You want to just drive around exploring the city? It's all there for you to do. 

[*]I love the scanner where you look at the environment for clues and ways to solve your objective. At certain quets there is also a playback function available of reality when you have the right hardware (in-game). This allows you to experience the game through the eyes of someone else finding details that this person might have missed or wasn't interested in but that can benefit your mission.

[*]When you want to get into a building there is usually a way - either by hacking the camera and remote access, breaking the windows or climbing and slipping through an industrial shutter. It's up to you if you want to sneak around, or just come in guns blazing.

[*][SPOILER]Johnny Silverhand works really well as a companion[/SPOILER]

[/olist]

[H1]The not so good[/H1]
[olist]
[*]I bought the game on Steam why should I still see yet another launcher before I can play the game? As a Netrunner this is unacceptable. Use the following steps to start without the launcher:
[code]
1. Open steam
2. Right click Cyberpunk 2077
3. Click properties
4. Click set launch options
5. Type: --launcher-skip and click ok.
[/code]

[*]The game overwhelms you with a large number of quests and it's not easy at first to see the difference between a main quest and a side quest. I played by sorting the quests in the order I got them - this meant doing a lot of side quests but it was fine for me as I wanted to see everything. The experience varies from basic to elaborate. While basic is still good, it shows that more was planned but had to be cut.

[*]Even on hard the game is not challenging. Pretty soon you are a Terminator and no one can stop you. [SPOILER]And then you meet Adam Smasher - that fight was so unbalanced :-([/SPOILER]

[*]At one point you experience flashbacks; the super bright white screens were not a great experience :-(.

[*]With sniper rifle you can see further than you can hit - your shots are not being registered as if there is a maximum range; likely an engine limitation. If you notice this you need to get closer to your target. 

[*]The mirrors don't seem to work unless you ""activate"" them. 

[*]It is not explained well that mods to weapons are permanent and that weapons cannot be upgraded. This is only different for Iconic weapons which can be upgraded and have their mods replaced. 

[*]I missed a faction reputation system: when I attack a gang they should be looking for me if I get recognised but this just doesn't happen except for some scripted events. The same should also apply to continue committing crimes - at one point you should become a fugitive not being able to just hide and wait and perhaps do time in prison with missions to break out. 

[*]The cops are perfectly fine with you murdering their colleagues or driving in their vehicles while standing next to you. 

[*]The metro is like an after-thought: while in most situation CP:2077 goes for an immersive experience; taking the metro is underwhelming: the transition to the metro is just a loading screen. The romantic / soft porn scenes feel forced, with just a couple of options and they never change.
[/olist]

[H1]The DLCs[/H1]
Three DLCs have been released:
[olist]
[*][b]Cyberpunk 2077 Bonus Content[/b] offers extra digital goodies for CP:2077.
[*][b]Cyberpunk 2077 REDmod[/b] gives you the ability to mod the game in different ways: custom scripts, animations and sound
[*][b]Phantom Liberty[/b] (included in the Ultimate Edition): think of it as CP:2077 on steroids. It's really, really good and massive: I highly recommended playing it. I found it better than the main game and takes quite some time to complete. It also offers new mechanics and skills to the game. 
[/olist]

[H1]Bugs and glitches[/H1]
CP:2077 had a large number of bugs and glitches at launch: it’s one of the reasons I waited with purchasing it. All of the larger issues have been fixed but there are still a couple of glitches; if you notice these, a restart will help. It’s rare though and the game and DLC are fine as they are. Just save often (like in any game (F5)).

[H1]Summary[/H1]
CP:2077 went for full immersion and from the start you feel you are part of night city. It brought back the feeling I had while playing Fallout 3 or Mass Effect 2.  Don't believe people that say it is like GTA5, because it is not, and that's fine (we have GTA6 coming soon™ anyway). 

The story is amazing and if you just play for that you will have a great time with many twists and your choices will affect the outcome of the final story – many times there is no good or bad choice. There are still some bugs and glitches present but nothing is too game breaking. 

[H1]Should you buy it?[/H1]
""Wake the f**k up, Samurai. We have a city to burn."" Yes! It’s highly recommended. Also get PL from the start.

Cyberpunk 2077 is a game that has journeyed from a turbulent launch to a resounding redemption, ultimately delivering a gaming experience that encompasses a gripping story, engaging gameplay, robust player development, a sprawling map, and a richly woven world narrative. CD Projekt Red's dedication and the addition of an anime series have transformed it into a true gem in the gaming world.

Storytelling and Narrative (5/5):
Cyberpunk 2077's story is nothing short of a masterpiece. Set in the sprawling, neon-drenched Night City, players assume the role of V, a character whose fate is intricately tied to the city's web of politics, corporations, and underground factions. The narrative is a thrilling rollercoaster ride filled with twists and turns that keep players on the edge of their seats. Choices matter, leading to multiple branching storylines and outcomes, providing a true sense of agency in the game's world.

Gameplay (5/5):
The gameplay in Cyberpunk 2077 is a dynamic fusion of action, stealth, and RPG elements. Combat is fluid and customizable, offering a plethora of ways to tackle challenges, whether it's through hacking, marksmanship, or close-quarters combat. The depth of character customization, including cyberware enhancements and skill progression, allows players to tailor their experience, resulting in each encounter feeling fresh and uniquely engaging.

Player Development (5/5):
The player development system in Cyberpunk 2077 is deeply satisfying. As you progress, you gain experience points that can be spent on enhancing your character's abilities, cyberware, and attributes. Watching your character evolve from a novice to a cyber-enhanced powerhouse is immensely rewarding and adds a layer of depth to the gameplay.

 Exploration (5/5):
Night City is a sprawling, breathtaking open world that feels alive and brimming with detail. The scale and verticality of the city are staggering, inviting players to explore every corner. The diverse districts, each with its distinct atmosphere, provide a genuine sense of place. Whether navigating the neon-lit streets or ascending towering skyscrapers, Night City's size and intricacy are a marvel to behold.

World Narrative (5/5):
The world-building in Cyberpunk 2077 is exemplary. From the omnipresent advertisements and propaganda to the rich lore embedded in conversations with its denizens, every facet of Night City tells a story. The game tackles profound themes of transhumanism, corporate dominance, and societal decline, offering a poignant commentary on our own world.

The journey of Cyberpunk 2077, from a rocky start to a redemptive triumph, is a testament to the commitment of CD Projekt Red and their love for the game and its community. The addition of an anime series expanded the game's universe and breathed new life into it. Cyberpunk 2077, in its current state, stands as a shining example of what dedication and support from developers can achieve. It's a must-play experience that help defines the open-world RPG genre and has earned its place as a modern classic in the gaming world. ",1608487321,1706948275,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The gameplay on its own isn't anything too special. It's a looter shooter with an abilities system. The vehicles could be better, as handling for the majority of them just feel really heavy and kind of bad.

But the story... the world building... the characters are so incredibly believable... The human experience is so vivid in this world. I wanted nothing more than to keep playing the game after getting 100% completion. But I'm ready to put it down now and let it become a fond memory. I hope CDPR continues to add to this universe.

Introduction:
Having spent over 600 hours immersed in the sprawling dystopia of Night City, traversing its neon-lit streets and navigating the complexities of its narrative, Cyberpunk 2077 has been an exhilarating and, at times, tumultuous journey. As a day one player who has explored the game extensively on both Xbox and PC platforms, the experience has been a roller coaster ride filled with highs and lows. With the release of the Phantom Liberty DLC, CD Projekt Red has not only addressed some of the game's initial shortcomings but also crafted an expansion that stands tall among the best in the gaming industry.

Graphics and Design:
Right from day one, Cyberpunk 2077 showcased a visual spectacle that was both stunning and ambitious. The vibrant, cyberpunk aesthetic of Night City is brought to life with a meticulous attention to detail, from the towering skyscrapers of the corporate districts to the gritty alleyways of the combat zones. The lighting effects and reflective surfaces contribute to an immersive experience that captures the essence of a dystopian future. While the game faced criticism for performance issues on release, subsequent updates and patches have significantly improved stability on both platforms, allowing players to appreciate the game's visual splendour.

Gameplay and Mechanics:
The gameplay mechanics in Cyberpunk 2077 are a mixed bag. The open-world exploration and freedom of choice in approaching missions provide a sense of agency, but issues such as AI behaviour and occasional glitches can be distracting. The gunplay and combat mechanics, though not groundbreaking, are solid and satisfying, with a variety of weapons and cyberware augmentations to experiment with. The inclusion of the DLC Phantom Liberty introduces new weapons, cyberware, and vehicles, enriching the gameplay experience and adding depth to character customization.

Story and Narrative:
One of Cyberpunk 2077's strengths lies in its intricate narrative and well-developed characters. The main storyline, revolving around the enigmatic Johnny Silverhand and V's struggle for survival, is compelling and emotionally charged. The choices players make throughout the game shape the outcome, offering a level of replayability. The Phantom Liberty DLC seamlessly weaves into the existing narrative, introducing new characters and story arcs that expand the lore of Night City. The DLC's writing is sharp, maintaining the gritty and thought-provoking tone established in the base game.

Phantom Liberty DLC:
Phantom Liberty stands out as a shining example of how post-launch content can elevate a game. The expansion introduces a captivating storyline, taking players deeper into the conspiracies and power struggles within Night City. The new areas to explore are meticulously designed, offering a fresh perspective on the city's diverse districts. The addition of new missions, side quests, and a compelling antagonist enhances the overall experience. Notably, the DLC's emphasis on player choices and consequences adds an extra layer of complexity to an already intricate narrative.

Technical Improvements:
Over the course of the past year, CD Projekt Red has been diligent in addressing the technical issues that plagued the game's launch. Numerous patches and updates have significantly improved performance and stability, mitigating crashes and glitches. The commitment to ongoing support and improvement is commendable, turning Cyberpunk 2077 into a more polished and enjoyable experience for players who stuck with the game through its initial challenges.

Conclusion:
For a day one player with over 600 hours invested in Cyberpunk 2077, the journey has been one of evolution and redemption. The game's visual and narrative strengths have always been apparent, but the technical hiccups at launch were a significant setback. With consistent updates and the outstanding Phantom Liberty DLC, CD Projekt Red has not only addressed those issues but also elevated the overall experience. The game, in its current state, is a testament to the developers' commitment to delivering a memorable and immersive cyberpunk adventure. Phantom Liberty, with its engaging storyline and thoughtful additions, cements Cyberpunk 2077 as a contender for Game of the Year, showcasing the potential for redemption in the ever-evolving landscape of the gaming industry.",1706935140,1706935140,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- The keybindings are a mess, if you don't select secondary you can't proceed. See pcgamewiki on how to fix

CDPR, in my opinion, did what we all hoped that they would despite all of our discourse. 

the game wasn't ""trash"" on launch. but it definitely wasn't good. 

i'm giving that its own paragraph just to push the latter part of that statement. CDPR did, however put their noses to the grindstone and make it better over the years. so incomprehensibly better that it does boggle my tiny brain. they took the horrible shit we said to them. they listened. they tried to be better and did end up being better. 

i felt betrayed how bad this game was on launch. but...  i also knew what they did with the witcher series. which, to be honest was great. didn't mean i was gonna give them a free pass and not talk a serious amount of shit. which i did. 

but..... the state that this game is right now. the perseverance that this team has shown... i really can't give this game anything less than 9/10... if the launch weren't so horrible, it would honestly be 10/10. 

the storytelling, the believable and honest dialogue, the  grit. the willingness to tell a compelling story amidst social media scrutiny of stupidity or validity (depending on how you look at it). it's just unmatched in games these days. 
they didn't want to just rehash a bunch of microtransaction garbage and game mechanics that we're all just supposed to be used to and accept now. they told an interesting and original story, and also had a pretty fucking bad ass soundtrack. not just the original score, but also the radio. 

i'm drunk and making a review. but... steam asked me to, so no apologies. 

after 3 years.... this will probably be remembered almost as much a masterpiece as the witcher series. at least, in my broken-ass brain.",1706924067,1706924067,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The graphics are incredible. In particular, the facial animations of all the NPCs and the landscape views you can get of the city are stunning. The facial animations and the way the map is designed combines for one of the most immersive games I have personally experienced.

The main story, and the ""important"" side quests around the more prominent NPCs are well written and sometimes quite heartwrenching. There's good variety here and there should be something for everyone. There's additional content in terms of gigs which are voice acted. I quite enjoyed doing the gigs as they fit quite well into the game and story since your background is that you are a merc - it helps a great deal that they are voice acted well.

Little by little, they tweaked it, added things, balanced the mechanics, and opened (most of) the settings to be changed for maximum playability. Now, after all this time, we can safely say that the programmers working hard day-in and day-out to polish this dream to as close to perfection as they possibly could, have once again broken everything and sent many of us back to square one. They are never going to fix the most basic things, like keybinds. Nobody can fix people who say ""just get a controller"", that's a different problem that the developers aren't responsible for. What they are responsible for is the fact that keyboards have hard-coded commands that, after all this time and all the complaints, they still refuse to get rid of. Screw you if you play with keyboard and mouse, this is soft-core porn for people who use controllers.

Regardless, you can't really fix something that is fundamentally broken from the ground up. The main character is dumb as shit regardless of the dialogue options, and acts like it doesn't know anything or have the ability to think. Even if you try to bash your way through the game, the plot tries to force you to care about characters that either have extremely limited interactions, or are about as deep as a wet shoe. Meanwhile you're most likely a murderous cyborg pretending to care about things that have nothing to do with the primary gameplay. At the very least, let me have an observant main character that doesn't need everything spelled out for them. It used to be embarrassing. Now it's insulting.

How many years will I have to wait before I can use E to walk forward? Either get rid of hard keys, or get rid of the rebinding menu in settings. Or, at the VERY LEAST, fix the reset that happens every time I exit settings, and remove the rebinds in the menu that don't actually change regardless what I try to set them to. I'm on QWERTY, but I've seen AZERTY people having the same problem. It really is an issue of not caring about people who use keyboard and mouse, which is a significant number of people who play this game.",1706897870,1706897870,False,1,1,0.498680472373962402,0,True,False,False

Got myself a PS5 in anticipation of better performance, I wasn't disappointed. I had a couple of macbooks die a year after and switched to a desktop PC+Linux and here I am on Steam, actively.

So on a RTX 3060 and an i5 this is pretty great, and mods really bring my interest back to the game. 

I have complaints, but they're mostly about unskippable cutscenes, and things I can now use mods to get around.  The CDPR choices, of gameplay elements to mess with, from one patch to another is pretty irritating.   You take time to tune a build for your play style, and they screw it completely.

The world, graphics, characters and soundtrack are downright amazing. The gunplay starts off a little janky but you do get used to it over time. The biggest problem is definitely the performance. There are bugs and glitches that made me reload previous saves multiple times, but I did get past them.

Overall, I really enjoy this game despite its flaws, but hopefully they will be fixed in future updates and patches. My score is 7.5/10

Jester me all you want, I have made myself a citizen in Night City for more than 20 days straight and have loved every moment. Besides the crashes.

IMO: I've been waiting for companies, other than Rockstar, to make an outstanding open-world experience in a huge city landscape, and I think Cyberpunk 2077 takes the cake GTA V gave us and lit 20 more candles, added 2x the amount of not-so-tasty showcase icing with some LED strips at the bottom of the base. To give us, what is now a statue of what used to be an edible treat. Everything feels fresh and new and I'm excited to continue exploring the world. Even after a 3rd complete playthrough. The VAs feels like they really tried to make these scenes have emotion in them, and it doesn't come off as cringe-inducing. Keanu can sound like an over-dramatic-anime-boy sometimes, but you soon realize there are reasons he acts the way he does. The bugs have been really inconsistent, even when I first bought the game, so that has been really pleasant. I think overtime, we will get everything we were promised by the devs, just like for No Man's Sky, but even for an ""unfinished game"" this game is and was quite incredible for PC users at launch. 

P.S. Please implement the option of making a custom radio please, the music in this game is great, but it's somewhat limited to genres and each radio has a very small amount of songs in them.",1613109690,1706849467,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

The characters are mostly annoying, the story is average, there's nothing to do in the city outside of story missions other than some repetitive combat side quests, the police are brain dead and are implemented worse than in game from over a decade ago, there's no car customization, the clothing options are a joke both in design and because outside of a couple cut scenes, you'll never see them without a third person view, there's little outside of the main story to do with the various factions and gangs, they wasted time on three beginnings that have little meaning beyond the tutorial, the most interesting companion is gone by the end of the first mission, the most fun looking part of the game is a montage that looks like the game we should have played, public transportation is oddly cut, driving mechanics are awful, the streets are practically empty of people and vehicles, I could go on for pages about what's wrong with this game so I'll spare you and just say that if you haven't already lost your hard earned money to this smoke and mirrors hustle, don't even consider it at any price outside of free and free won't make it a better game.

There are many examples, but this will be the one we always remember because it should and could have been so much more.
 EDIT JAN 2024:
Still a busted broken mess. Every update that brings in new features keeps adding more problems. Patch 2.11, over three years after we were asked to pay for this, is still a mess and added tons of technical issues and this trash company is taking a social media victory lap like they accomplished something. It's pathetic. It's clear CDPR punched way above their weight with this garbage game and now they're not only bragging but acting like the sequel is going to be amazing. These clowns can't do what Rockstar did over a decade ago and they're arrogant? Pathetic. It's a bad product, full stop.

I started this game like most when it first came out being disappointed and eventually finding myself slugging my way through until beating the game. As much as I thought the game was good I also didn't find it great due to many problems with the game and not having that thing that drove it home to make me play through the game again. A year or 2 after the game was released I started to play the game again...

WOW!

After many patches and a long road to repair and update the game I am more then happy to say this has been one of the greatness video game experiences of my life! Not only did the 2.0 update make the game play incredibly fun to play but the DLC to this game wraps this game up perfectly as it was truly meant to be made. The poetisicm with this game is unparalleled to most games I've played, It is such a driving focus to what V's (protagonist) thoughts and feelings are as the story progresses. It does it in such a beautiful way that it makes the whole experience truly immersive, This game was held back by that during release and after many hard fought hours. The creators of this gamer turned gold into diamond.

I don't have a top-tier rig, so there were the expected issues with FPS, game dynamics, clipping, and the occasional crash; Didn't really matter though; The story line is compelling enough to look past those issues, and overall the graphics and game play were mostly smooth; 

Phantom Liberty dropped during my first play thru - I added it right before playing the final missions of the original's main story line; This was a good call because it extended my first run by 20-30 hrs; But I'll also say I didn't really find the PL content and story all that mind-blowing compared to the main game - the 'spy'-thriller angle just didn't seem to fit the world (or maybe it was just not executed properly? idk); Fortunately, I still had the main game's final, face-melting missions, which allowed me to look on PL as sort of a long side quest that just wasn't that interesting;

Don't expect Cyberpunk to be a first person shooter, because it is not. This is a story focused Role-Playing-Game with lots of dialogues and stealth. The Shooting system as well as melee combat are just decent. Everything else is top notch.

Yeah, it can still be fairly buggy and it's not perfect. However I was so surprised at how emotionally invested I was in the main story. I like this game a lot, probably one of my favourites. I'm gonna write a positives and negatives below. But overall my enjoyment of the game out-ways my dislikes.

vague spoilers ahead

POSITIVES:
 Main story. There's a level of misdirection in the beginning that I think really works in the story's favour. So many characters and points you think are gonna be important only for the game to really punch you in the face and leave you in a gutter, but in a good way? I love that the main focus of the story is more emotional than you think it's gonna be. Themes of personal identity are always super interesting to me and that is at the core of the story. I also love stories with a strong base in social/political themes. Obviously this game could just be enjoyed as a fun shooter. But I love how integrated the social and political problems of the world is to the quests. I think about what my actions would mean for the world around me, even if its just a small side quest with no actual consequences in the game. 

voice acting. This can really be a deal breaker for me sometimes. The voice acting has to be a good mix of believable and genuine but still slightly overacted and punchy and I think this game walks that line really well. I especially appreciate the work the male voice actor did for V. Too many male main characters are voiced with a lack of genuine emotion. V felt very real to me. You can really hear it in his voice, they weren't afraid to make him emotional. I love that.

City design. I am genuinely quite impressed at the scale and detail of the city in its appearance and layout.  It looks and feels like a city that came about over time rather than designed. the roads are as winding and confusing as real cities. It's something I have only seen games like GTA do well. On top of that, barely any loading screens. It is quite impressive that you can drive from one end of this map to the other, walk into every shop on the way, and never see a loading screen. Obviously it results in bugs and some crashing but i still commend the effort. It really helps with the immersion. 

Queer and Trans characters. Now there are some issues with the character creator for this topic which I will cover below. However, it is still so uncommon to have a game that just lets you have a tarns character so that alone is really appreciated. As a trans person it made me feel so much more connected to V. Sure it's not important to the story, but i don't need that. I would love for my real life to feel more like that. There is also a main-ish character who is openly transgender and that makes me very happy. You don't just get to avoid talking to them just because you might be weird about it. She is treated just like any other character in the game and i respect that.

music and soundtrack. They did a bang up job of the mains score. I listen to it so often. I don't know what to say other than its just so good. Each moment and situation has a score that fits and really extenuates the moment. And then the radio music is just fantastic. It really helps to make the world feel real.

Combat. In my opinion the combat is really fun. There's so many options for how to approach a fight and ways to combine it all. There's you standard guns and melee weapons but combine that with brain hacking, vehicle combat and cybernetic augmentations. It really does give you a variety of ways to enjoy combat.

NEGATIVES:

Pacing. Maybe it's just me, but I find the pacing of the main quest really feels at odds with the rest of the game. This is an open world RPG with a lot to explore and many side quests well worth doing. But the main quest has such a sense of urgency that interferes with my immersion. I found myself feeling silly for going off doing fun racing side quests and gigs when the main character seems to be in the middle of a major crisis and is fighting against time to help himself. I think the main story just needed to give the player a bit more breathing room early on before pushing them into the main plot.

Trigger warning. This isn't a huge issue to me personally and not by any means my biggest problem. But i was surprised at how dark some of the plot points could be, even with just side quests. There's a lot of upsetting topics and I don't have any problem with exploring those things, I actually think the story telling around it all is really good. But this game has a lot of triggering subjects such as suicide, rape/sexual harassment, drug abuse, snuff films and i guess technically terminal illness. These topics aren't super explicit and in your face, but they are themes and topics that are very much a part of the main game and worth knowing before hand. So i just wanted to put it in my review for those who may benefit from knowing.

Character Customisation. I was quite disappointed at the boundaries within the character customisation. What is there is really cool. The best options are with the hair. The tattoos and mods and eye colours are very cool. But there's just not ENOUGH of them. You have basically 5 tattoo options. which is wild to me because there's endless possibilities there, and it just seems it was not given much attention. Even little things, like the fact that you cant have two different coloured eyes. It seems silly to complain about but it would have been so easy to include, so why not? this is a cyberpunk future where body modification has endless possibilities, so why do I have such vanilla options? it just seems such a shame, especially since so many other games and doing much more. 

Adding on to this. I appreciate getting to make my character transgender, however how it is implemented just isn't quite right. It makes no sense as to why the voice options determine your pronouns, its unnecessary and just puts more boundaries on who your character can be. It's just a shame they slightly missed the mark on that one. And want to be some kind of Nonbinary? nope, that just doesn't seem to exist in this universe for some reason. But I still appreciate what is there and I look forward to how they might better it in future games.

City immersion. I appreciate that a lot of the updates have helped with the immersion, such as using the metro and enjoying a drink in your apartment, but it still feels a little lacking in some areas. This could just be very specific to what I want from a game, but I want to be able to do EVERYTHING. for example the food vendors. They don't really serve a real game play purpose, so why not allow my character to properly sit down and animate them eating? I know it's not important but it makes the world feel real and lived. The clubs are all so cool but you can only dance in one of them. Why cant V sit on most empty seats? Why cant V get black out drunk after too much alcohol and wake up in a ditch? I want the world to feel real and not just a set for V to walk around. Maybe future updates might add them. 

Last but not least. I cant romance Claire, Takemura or the hot bartender at Lizzie's bar. Not important at all. But I want to KISS them and i'm SAD that i CAN'T :( 

Anyway this is the biggest review I have ever written and I only write it because I am waiting for the game to finish updating so I can keep playing it. Overall I really like the game and I think now is the best time to get it, it's constantly getting updated and things being added. I understand it really was a bit of a shit show when this game first came out, but I'm glad CD project red didn't just abandon it. They are still working on making the game better and I think that's real cool of them.

 Cheers if you took the time to read this.

I can’t leave a neutral review score, but I don’t want to give it the thumbs up either, sorry.

Note: I didn’t play at launch.


Spoilers below:


Controversial or not, *** [i]Male V and Keanu’s voices are bad. Their performances are wooden and insufferable. Especially Keanu’s . (After finishing the game, they became tolerable)[/i]


**[i]The radio is simply unplayable. Songs constantly repeating. Barely any good songs, or radio hosts, and on top of that, you have the terrible driving system (physics all messed up) which renders the radio pointless, in my opinion. Comparing it to San Andreas (which is my favourite GTA), where I had the radio constantly on, with great songs on every station, and you could ride and play music and do nothing else. You can do this in Cyberpunk too, but it’s not even remotely pleasant. Yes, you can just listen while walking around, but I only like a couple of songs, at most. I just couldn’t be bothered, after a point.[/i]


*Driving just sucks, in terms of handling, sounds, looks and lack of customization in garages. Also no garages for V and his fleet of cars.


*Gameplay wise, stealth sucks at the beginning with a silenced pistol (You can one hit kill with a thrown weapon, you can’t one hit kill with a headshot.), and enemies are bullet sponges. Especially cyberpsychos. 


NPCs just wander around doing nothing. Or endlessly doing the same thing.


Melee fighting is awful, enemies just hit the air and somehow you get hit, or they teleport to you hitting. Really bad mechanics.

Showering with clothes on and sleeping weirdly on your own bed.

You can’t buy anything from the million street vendors, who are useless.

*Wish you could train on the punching bag and lift some weights with Coach Fred.

**Happy Together quest just fails in a day, if you don’t know what to do.


Cops homing in even if you stealth kill various NPCs (like Fingers, or Lenny Nero).


**[i]JoyToy moments and various Red Districts quite tame and disappointing. Only 2 in the entire city? With all the crazy sex ads and merchandise, you’d think there’d be more. It seems like cut content. And censoring.[/i]


***[b]No braindances outside from scripted ones, even though there are many vendors with so many BDs.  So many more things could have been done with the BDs. Detective V and Johnny on the case? Another missed opportunity.[/b]


*[i]I stealth kill an enemy with a silenced pistol, and Judy says, “I heard shots, you still alive?” – “I’m here, got No time to creep around”, V yells. Enemies getting alerted, through walls, even though there were no cameras, and kills were silent.[/i]


Setting a trap which falls, killing 2 NPCs who were further away, but scripted to patrol there.

We see the same NPCs even after a few days have passed. For example, in Afterlife, the mercs crying about the ripperdoc, yelling “why aren’t we at a hospital”.

With Panam, silent killing with a pistol an enemy – “I’ve been made”. 

NPCs start running way if you bump into one. 

NPCs following system is too slow. 

After killing various gang members, and saving civilians, too many NPCs remain there, as if nothing happened.

Wish there was a way to show weapons being in some holster, anywhere. You’re just pulling them out of your pants. 


***[b]So many missions talking about “need you here”, “hurry up”, “tonight”, “tomorrow”, “in the evening”, “now”, when nothing really happens if you take your time. There is no sense of urgency in the game. And that’s the problem with the entire game design and quest system. The Relic is killing you and you can just waste time sightseeing, because ultimately the game doesn’t account for that. Which is why I hope the next Cyberpunk game won’t have anything to do with a relic, disease, or anything else that is supposed to kill you soon.[/b]


Clipping through NPCs. There’s no collision. Important characters walk through you, or you through them. Others are solid.

While talking to Karim Noel and proving I’m a big Samurai fan, after going back to him, he just asks “do I know you?”. Okay, thanks.


You don’t sleep, you just wait. 

*Using Overwatch to stealth from behind cover, all enemies immediately turn and home in on your position.

The Sinnerman quest – Scripted cars just ramming into the NCPD armored vehicle again and again. A bit absurd, looks weird. Also, we are a few meters behind, and Bill is screaming “We can’t lose him”, or other grunts. “Brake I said, BRAKE!” when nothing is happening. And then Bill gets out and dies. Of course, it’s a random semi blocking the road. 

The NPCs driving you around make the car camera go crazy.

Can’t give spare eddies to street performers. But you can help veterans.


***[b]No consequences to V killing countless gang members, no gang wars, no turf wars, nothing. The fixers aren’t bothered by your killing their goons and ruining their operations. No consequences. [/b]


Wish you could turn off all the various lights in bases. Hack everything. Every little panel. Unfortunately, it’s not about light detection when you’re stealthing. 

I walk the line quest - if you bait the Undertaker, the robot keeps fighting by himself.

Scripted car chase scenes are so slow and ugly.

Wearing a coat in cutscenes has V’s arms clipping through.


**[i]Beat Razor, no reaction from the crowd, no cutscene. As if nothing happened. Coach Fred remained quiet and in the same position as before the fight. Then he sent a text message calling me legend. Really lame.[/i]
*In a club you can stealth kill an enemy or walk through a “restricted” door, and the normal NPCs start yelling and running, even though they didn’t see or hear you, but no one gets triggered. When you use your technical ability to open a door, random NPCs lose their minds “Mercy I did nothing to you”. 


Killed the 1 beat cop and two Tyger Claws goons at the Snagged Synapse Roasters corner, and they respawned a few days later with the exact same dialogue as if nothing happened.

The attachments/modding part is not really that good. Especially since you can’t remove the mods. Same with crafting, not really that interesting.


*The same repeated intro shows when you start the game are just annoying.


**[i]Street rep is gained way too fast, especially if you’re clearing random enemies. You can become a legend in no time. The bonuses are lame.[/i]


**Going to the same location multiple times, and you see the same NPCs with the exact same dialogue (example at Clouds the guys talking about blow-up dolls and infidelity).

Always funny when you just go through NPCs personal computers right next to them and they don’t mind.

Another thing that has caught my attention is the gameplay, because I loved it. The game has dozens of different gameplay styles; if you like stealth, you can do it; if you like explosions, you can have massive explosions; and if you want to hack everyone, you can do it. Want to be a futuristic ninja? Don't worry; you'll become one. I also strongly recommend playing this game slowly because, as I mentioned in the story, it's incredible, and there are numerous side quests with interesting missions. But the main reason for taking it slowly is that Night City is an absolutely stunning scenario, arguably the best I've seen in a game. So my advice is to spend some time simply enjoying the scenario; believe me, it's an incredible experience.
Of course, Cyberpunk still has some issues (in my case, they didn't interfere with anything), but if you've played RDR2, you'll be irritated by some details (side effects of releasing an incomplete game), and in these cases, Cyberpunk won't be rated ten out of ten. However, if you're a gamer like me who enjoys action RPGs with multiple choices, you'll consider this game a masterpiece. (After all, one of the reasons I don't get annoyed by some minor details is that I've already played Bethesda Games a dozen times, so yeah, if you've played, don't worry, there's nothing you didn't see in there.) So just go ahead and give it.",1706750468,1706750608,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It was good then, and now it's quite perfect with the recent care and polishing along with the DLC. The recent updates and dlc really have changed the game by adding more content, perks and ways to play and many more quality of life aspects. Plus, you can't forget the addition of mods now, so you can freely change different items or how stuff works to your liking. The game still has divine graphics and a thrilling story based in the beloved night city that you can get lost in and have a blast exploring.

I have sunk 300hrs as of right now and I had fun and enjoined every bit of those hours of playing. Keep in mind I have also 100% it and the achievements but this game is defiantly a game I'd recommend it to any one who likes single player games. And reminder its a RPG but it is still on tracks, given that the story is still a rich one worth trying.

TLDR: A great immersive game with beautiful graphics and a medium-length story, but DLC and side quests make up for it. It has great character development along with immersion, and the music is fantastic and fits perfectly with the setting and voice acting. If you haven't checked it out, I would recommend it. It's polished and has more activities than before.

I suspect because I hadn't let myself get too hyped up back then, there was no let down on promises not kept by CDPR. 

Flash forward into 2022 with Edgerunners' release and I found myself playing another run through of 2077. Add in 2.0 and Phantom Liberty in 2023 and well...I'm glad I almost let myself forget about this game. The return experience was the reserved enjoyment I had of it in 2020 but multiplied by 5.

This inturn also scales down your resolution and creates weird sharpening artefacts and a variety of visual problems that make the game unplayable to the point that ps3 graphics look a whole lot better than this.

Seems to be driver related, no amount of troubleshooting has provided a solution for myself and many others. Was hoping this weeks update would provide a fix but it is STILL broken ever since the 2.1 content drop. Please let me play this game again?

It's finally been updated to a point where the amazing visual, sound design, and open world design is working with the character creation and growth. Before the 2.0 update I loved this game world, but it felt boring to be in - more like a walking simulator. A lot of things were also crazy annoying and laborious for no reason, like buying certain gear or clothing. 

Now it's at a point where I enjoy the character growth and skill choices as much as the world itself and it's awesomely blended into the product it should have been at launch.

Once you get it to launch consistently you can expect to keep having glitches. Sometimes you'll exit your vehicle and fall through the ground. One very common glitch is after conducting a transaction at a gun shop, or even just randomly, when you draw your weapon it fires automatically, reloads, and continues to fire. Always fun when you're trying to sneak around.

I didn't buy the game at launch because I normally wait for sales and because I'd heard a lot about how disastrous it was. It was unfortunate to see the reputation of such a top-tier studio damaged by corpos failing to listen to devs, which is ironic considering the themes the game explores. 

After a decent sale sprang up and Phantom Liberty was announced, I purchased the game and dove right into it when the DLC released. I was not disappointed in the slightest - the worldbuilding, story, characters, gameplay and music are masterful. You feel fully immersed in the plausibly grim future that Cyberpunk 2077 portrays, and the combat and progression system are incredibly satisfying. Keanu Reeves and Idris Elba both deliver in their performances, without any of the cheesiness that sometimes comes with stars featuring in AAA games. The regular voice actors also did an excellent job, particularly the voice actress for female V.

Had this game been released in 2023 I think it would have been seen as a generational work of art. I'm glad I waited it out and got to experience the completed product, even if it took 3 years for it to get there. Although a big mistake was made in rushing out an unfinished game, in my eyes CDPR have totally redeemed themselves and I can't wait for the sequel!",1706714463,1706714582,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm giving this a review well after launch, though I did play during it's rough launch.

The build-up to this game was not only over hyped but by contrast well under delivered. Their promise of customization and 'be who you want in night city' was a lie. You did get to choose dick or vag tho, gotta love that pandering for no real integration. NPCs are still really jank and serve little to no point other than the countless bodies waiting to die in little pockets around the city. Cops are still pretty pointless, get out of sight and suddenly you're crime free. As much as they expressed this game being 'immersive', there's not a lot that actually gives any part of the external world atmosphere. If it's not a quest or story set piece, you can tell it was just slapped together to fill the empty city with content. Also, still regularly found people walking into the floor, cars clipping into each other (Including in cut scenes). Open RPGs like Skyrim are fun because of the nonsense that can come from sandbox elements. Nothing happens when civvies are basically mindless, cops are pointless and enemies just hang out until you shoot them.

The skill tree is fun since the overhaul, lots of little choices that do impact gameplay rather than just % bonuses to stuff. One of the only games I can say satisfied the netrunner/hacker fantasty for me though in an action combat style. Shooting is fine, hard to fuck that up much especially at this budget level. 

The story is mid, at best, and the night city dialect dialog wears off pretty quick which then show really low effort writing. Take out the 'chooms' and other NC specific words and you get bland, mostly flavorless conversations. To be fair, it could be much worse. Neat ideas, like the ramp up to the end and the firewall - but Keanu was basically there for star power to sell the game and his character serves little purpose. Choosing an origin is almost entirely pointless, as are any plots or dialog that might stem from it.  For that matter, why did we get 'V' instead of a fully custom character?Sure, voice acting might be an excuse but they could have chosen any word to refer to your player character that wasn't a specific name. Which is what they implied when the game was first being announced, that we'd get to build our person in night city. They had a clear vision for who V is, your choices don't usually matter and come down to 'Do you want to be agreeable? Or sassy?' Clearly they had to cut back to even make it to launch, barely getting the core story out nevermind side quests or the vast emptiness of most regions. 

All in all, the game is a fun time and I could recommend it now. I'm not sure 60$ worth of recommend, maybe wait for a sale. Especially since there's a DLC. 60$ would have been fine, if I weren't salty about it's launch state and the amount of lies we were fed for publicity prior to launch for features and concepts to just never made it into a game, which is now just a bounty hunter sandbox with a disfigured, choppy story placed on a top.

If you played prior to 2.0, honestly outside of the skill trees nothing much of note has changed. If restarting your skill tree doesn't interest you, probably just pass on coming back.",1706713211,1706713211,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Incredible game, it's so immersive and I wish we were getting more expansions.


Originally I purchased it on release but refunded as my hardware wasn't strong enough (no upscaling/perf fixes on release, but I had upgraded by the time I did play later on).

I did a full play through on Version 1.5 in Feb 2022, and I felt the game was pretty complete by then and I had a blast.
Never was one to do side quests etc so I finished the game and left it at that, however since 2.0/2.1 update the game is better than ever with new fixes, activities, romance options, complete overhauls of certain systems, physics etc. I've played through Phantom Liberty which introduces lots of new content and have gotten multiple endings (not really a fan of the new alternate ones). While the game still has small bugs, I've been completely immersed in the cyberpunk world and going around completing every side quest I can and I am now considering a 2nd play through. One of my favourite games of all time, everything is amazing. Compared to what I played on 1.5 its a whole other level, and even back then I was completely captured by it.

Although it probably won't happen I'd love an expansion focused around what everyone considers the canon & best ending (Panam, Aldercados) to see what happens to them, some sort of story in the badlands and whether V can be cured as we know from Phantom Liberty that its possible.

You truly have outdone yourselves CDPR, I'm excited to put many more hours into this incredible world you've created.",1703039208,1706708359,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Every. Single. Complaint. I. Had. Has. Been. Fixed.

To be clear, there are still some bugs and visual glitches, and certainly some areas still need polish if you look closely, but nowhere near as bad as before.

Driving feels great, combat feels more fluid and alive, VEHICLE CHASES ARE HERE BABY. The police system has been completely overhauled and fixed, corpos/gangs will hunt you down if you piss them off, random events and gigs are actually worth doing, and it actually feels good to explore the world without feeling like you're wasting your time.

Phantom liberty was an excellent and content packed expansion, as expected from a CDPR game, once again be-clowning other publishers like Activision and Ubisoft who pretend a new multiplayer map or character skin is ""content"" worthy of a $20+ price tag.

With that said, I will qualify that CDPR should have never released the game in its original state on launch, and they should not be forgiven just because they fixed it years later. This shameful practice of ""kick it out the door now, fix it later"" must be chastised by players every time it happens, and we must vote with our wallets or it will never stop. I'm looking forward to the next CDPR game, but I will not be buying it as soon as it comes out like I did with Cyberpunk for this reason, until I see the reviews.

The most glaring issues the game had have been fixed, almost every aspect of the game has been touched in some way, some got a complete overhaul.


It has an incredibly enjoyable combat and stealth, fascinating and deep world to explore, an amazing story and some of the most high quality character animations in dialogues I've ever seen. 


However, I wouldn't call this a role playing game. There's very few actual choices you get to make throughout the game. The majority of the dialogue is painfully linear with most options coming down to ""Yes"", ""Angry Yes"", ""Nomad Yes"".
It's more like a high quality Far Cry game in a cyberpunk world. 


One aspect that is mostly unchanged from release is the absolutely shallow crowd behavior. It's not as janky as it used to be, however most crowd NPCs simply do that Joe Biden walk and nothing else. It doesn't feel as lively and natural as say Watch Dogs 2, that game's crowds are so alive!

The update they did on 2.1 massively revamped the game, giving me a lot of stuff to play and experiment  with, and the build diversity is quite fun as well. Even without the Phantom Liberty DLC, I think it's worth it to play, just so we can see the initial vision of the game that was promised, but not met.

While certainly a redemption arc for CD Projekt Red, the initial launch of the game was one of the biggest fumble in gaming history, alongside No Man's Sky and should be a reminder for everyone in the future about the danger of over-hyping and not meeting the expectations of players.

Eventually, I dropped it 16 hours in because of a game breaking bug and forgot about the game for 3 whole years until now. Cyberpunk 2077 with its 2.1 update is one of the best games I've ever played. The quality and amount of quests are really engaging and well written. The gameplay is incredibly fast, detailed and satisfying (must play on Hard or Very Hard). Night City is very detailed and lore heavy with distinct districts, giving off the perfect Cyberpunk vibe. Additionally, with path tracing this game looks stupidly good, I have taken over 3000 screenshots with the photo mode. The endings are the weakest part of the game in my opinion but Phantom Liberty fills that void for me with being insanely good in its own right. The expansion is a must play.

Cyberpunk 2077 has a lot going for it, and so it is hard to really sum it all up in a short form review. So instead, I'll list the things I liked and didn't like! 

What I enjoyed: Night City itself is fantastic, it is so well detailed and thought out, it feels so real and clearly had a lot of love and care put into it. The score is brilliant, it has quickly become one of my favourite video game scores ever, everything is a banger. The gunplay is super fun, I enjoyed the variety of loot and attachments you can use, along with a really fun skill tree that lends itself to lots of different play styles. Also, the graphics are insane, this is easily one of the best looking games I've ever played and it scares me how demanding the sequel will be.

What I didn't enjoy: while most of my time spent with Cyberpunk was overall positive, I did have a few gripes with it. Mainly the story. It is a very solid story, but somehow the side quests outshine the core beats of the main campaign and I wasn't really invested in V's struggle. It started off really strong, and I quite liked the ending (at least the route I took), but everything in between felt like a wild goose chase. Besides the story, some minor things like the game feeling very gamey at times, you'll know what I mean if you have played it, and this is mainly a nit pick and won't be for everyone, but I so wish there was a third person version. I don't think I was a fan of the first person stuff, but it didn't bog down the game enough for me and I was able to look past it.

Overall, if you are a fan of RPGs and are looking for a really immersive world and really fun gameplay mechanics, as well as just some awesome sci-fi stuff, then I can easily recommend this to you.",1702444019,1706675304,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False
1091500,157234597,76561198048396308,0,9,3083,0,2627,1706824985,"Short:
Wait for a discount. If you have patience for a buggy game, I think it's worth the discounted price.
In the other hand, it's so buggy, that whoever signed this off for release should feel bad, it's shameful. And this is 2 years after the release, on version 2.0!
Sometimes you can get stuck, need to reload, fiddle with stuff, but you can make it work. These big bugs are very rare, but still too frequent. Small bugs happen left and rights, but it's fine.
Story is also fine, just don't expect too much from it. If you have the expectation of a GTA V or Fallout 4, you will be in for a pleasant ride. People who expect Witcher 3, but neon signs might have their heart broken.

Longer. RPG exists, but it's kinda lightweight. You most of the time can choose between dialog options, but the exact text is not shown. Like fallout4. Dialog options usually not that very influental, but you definitely can take a few different roads, you can lock yourself out of characters/sidequests, or get some unobtainium car/equipment.

People who you interact with have some nice stories, some are very lovable, others are very hateable, but rarely bland, like they are actually a person, not just ""Bring 10 iron to the iron smith so he can do his favourite hobby: making swords"" kind of things.

Music is very nice, city vibes are also very nice, the different parts have different vibes, I love to just drive around doing fetch quests while listening to the radio. Fast travel has fairly good coverage who doesn't like it, tho it has quite a bit of public transport vibes to it. The city is fairly walkable.

Shoutout for accessibility features, vast majority of the voices can be shown on screen in a text form, including useless ped chatter, TV shows in the background, etc. It will even visualize if the voice is in another language.

Wait, if it's so good, why I'm downvoting?
Well, whenever I feel good, something throws me off. Usually a bug or bad design.
I called my car. It has a small animation as it arrives in the traffic. After frame-by-frame analysis of the InstantReplay footage, only thing I can say, is that under like 3 frame the care got teleported under a van, which got yeeted into the air a bit, and touched a cop. The cop started shooting at the car, but couldn't hit the driver from 5m. Driver just gone forward and backward for quite a few seconds, until he left.
Our cop did a 180° and started shooting at another seemingly innocent driver, shouted get out, then another cop started shooting. A text appeared above the cop ""I really don't like you"" but that sentence wasn't said. The only thing was said, while the driver was getting out, that ""No, you will put that away"". Then the cop hit the guy, and the guy got onto the ground, not sure if he died or not.

Then going home I got a notification that the NCPD want someone to help them with a shooting, and at the next left turn 3 people is shooting at the ceiling, many innocent citizens are dead, so I checked the guys out and started shooting at them. Then the cops started shooting at me... it seems i have to wait until at least one cop dies to be sure I can engage in these things.

The UI can be very confusing, sometimes after completing these NCPD tasks, I'm receiving notifications like +50xp or whatever for minutes! It even delays the reward, and the completion message.

Hitboxes are funky too, sometimes you cannot access the thing you need. Sometimes things just don't work. I had to get a certain item from a cars trunk and give it to the NPC: I took 12 reloads. I had to jump into the trunk, crouching, because otherwise couldn't reach the container. Getting the item wasn't smooth sailing, as sometimes I just coudln't give the item for the ncp, or the objective wasn't updated.
Other times I was hit by a car coming from the wrong direction. Where my car was shielding me.

At this point I'm not even sure if it's worth mentioning the countless cosmetic bugs, like when you open a gate or barrier, there's a good chance, that the lights on it will stay in the closed position

Despite all the problems that the developers have faced, I’ve adored this game since its launch. I pre-ordered Cyberpunk on my PlayStation when the world was still on lockdown, I still had enjoyment out of its initial release after the amount of delays it had received. Nearly four years later, I can definitely say that the franchise has earn its redemption. A lot more content, a lot less issues. The story is absolutely phenomenal, plus the DLC. The dialogue, the flow, the open-world environment, and the endings, but most importantly the characters. All the characters throughout the story are incredibly well written. Two of them happen to be played by very talented Hollywood actors (Keanu and Idris). Gameplay is both solid and satisfying too, both combat and driving feels a lot less dull than it was at launch. The DLC feels much more than an expansion, like you’re playing a totally brand new game. New play area, over 100+ weapons/vehicles added (including ones that were scrapped at launch), longer game duration but in a good way, and more endings, not just the DLC but the game too. Also check out Edgerunners too, easily one of the best animes I’ve ever watched. It will without a doubt make you see the game in a much more different perspective. That being said, this is personally my favorite RPG game of all time. Now that’s just an opinion, but this game is WAAAAAAAAAAAY better than Bethesda’s Starfield. Huge props to CD Projekt Red for taking their time to put this game back the way we thought before launch.

[b] What I Liked [/b]

I played at 1.0.  ""Played"" being the word here since I felt played that I bought into the hype.  The game looked bad, played bad, felt bad.  Bugs everywhere.

Now, with 2.1, the game is an absolute gem.  It looks better, plays better, and is mostly bug free.  Minor bugs are mostly related to visual effects (enemies fall through ground, float in air, etc.).  Bugs are game breaking.

The storyline is good, the side quests are incredible.  A couple side quests I took a break from the game after since they were really morally challenging.

I am playing on ""hard"" difficulty - and at this point it's dead easy.  I am running with a throwing knives and grenade build, and it works like a charm.  The first time I have seen a game get throwing weapons right in a very long time.  I am just having a blast with it all.

[b] What I Did Not Like [/b]

Honestly - not much.  The cars feel a bit light and flighty, but I mostly stick to motorcycles since it's easier to lane split.  The swearing gets to be too much.  I get it, it's part of the game.  I swear.  But eventually it stops adding flavor to the game and just becomes cringe.

[b] Why I Stopped Playing [/b]

Haven't yet.  I am trying to complete everything I can before beating the game.  We will see!  I wholeheartedly recommend this game now.  It's a complete blast to play.

And yes, it's my game of the year in 2024.  Been one of the best games I have played in a long, long time.

[b] Disclaimer [/b]

I have been a gamer for over 30 years.  I tend to play mostly PC games.  I also bounce around between games A LOT.  I may purchase a $60 game and play it for 2 hours or spend $10 on a game and spend 50 hours on it.  Even if I played a game a short time, it does not mean it is bad.  It just means another game caught my attention.  I also complain about flaws in games a lot, even about the littlest of things.  Keep that in mind when reading my reviews.  If I do not have a complaint, then the game must be special!

In the sprawling landscape of gaming, few titles dare to plunge players into a world as dense, dynamic, and daring as ""Cyberpunk 2077"". CD Projekt Red's long-anticipated opus is a thrilling symphony of neon-soaked streets, visceral combat, and morally ambiguous choices that beckon players to tread the thin line between hero and villain. Despite its share of glitches and controversies, ""Cyberpunk 2077"" emerges as an ambitious masterpiece that melds spectacle with substance in an unforgettable way.

Visually, ""Cyberpunk 2077"" is nothing short of breathtaking. Night City is a kaleidoscope of colors and contrasts, where towering skyscrapers cast long shadows over seedy alleyways, and bustling marketplaces create a symphony of urban life. The attention to detail is astonishing; every nook and cranny tells a story of a society torn between its technocratic dreams and its dystopian realities. Character models boast lifelike expressions and nuanced animations, drawing players deeper into a world teeming with personality.

The narrative is where ""Cyberpunk 2077"" truly shines. Inhabiting the role of V, a customizable protagonist, players navigate a complex web of alliances, betrayals, and personal quests that resonate with humanity's most profound desires and vulnerabilities. The writing is a blend of gritty noir and speculative futurism, tackling themes such as identity, corporate greed, and the cost of unchecked technological advancement. Every choice has palpable consequences, forcing players to grapple with the shades of gray in a world devoid of clear-cut morality.

Combat in ""Cyberpunk 2077"" is a frenetic ballet of bullets, blades, and brain-hacking abilities. The gun-play is satisfyingly punchy, offering an array of weapons that cater to diverse play-styles, from guns-blazing aggression to stealthy precision. The introduction of ""braindance"" sequences - where players explore memories from other characters' perspectives - adds an innovative layer to both storytelling and game-play. However, while combat is generally exhilarating, some issues like enemy AI and occasional technical hiccups can break immersion.

The soundscapes of Night City are an auditory marvel. The synth-heavy score, composed by the legendary duo of Marcin Przybyłowicz and Refused, infuses the game with a pulsating rhythm that underscores every triumph and heartache. The voice acting is top-notch, with Keanu Reeves' portrayal of the enigmatic Johnny Silverhand stealing the show. The city's ambient sounds, from blaring advertisements to muffled conversations, contribute to a sense of immersion that envelops players in the urban cacophony.

Yet, ""Cyberpunk 2077"" is not without its share of flaws. At launch, the game was plagued by technical glitches that tarnished the experience for many players. While subsequent patches have addressed numerous issues, some players might still encounter occasional bugs that detract from the otherwise seamless world. Additionally, the grandiosity of the world sometimes clashes with the limitations of last-gen hardware, leading to compromises in graphical fidelity.

In the end, ""Cyberpunk 2077"" is an audacious triumph that melds its awe-inspiring spectacle with an engrossing narrative and complex themes. Despite its initial stumbles, CD Projekt Red has crafted a game that invites players to lose themselves in the labyrinthine streets of Night City, encouraging them to question the nature of progress, power, and the price we pay for both. As patches continue to refine the experience, ""Cyberpunk 2077"" stands as a testament to the unyielding ambition of game development and the enduring allure of cyberpunk storytelling.",1693185481,1706659369,True,2,0,0.526813864707946777,0,True,False,False

CD Projekt red promised us an expansive open world with tons of fun shit to do and a great story with more than One or two romantic partners in game. what we got was a buggy shity compromising game which lacked any of the major features we were promised. 
    lets start with the basics shall we? 
firstly there is the supposed open world. the world in this game is huge but it's not entirely open, for starters you can't even access most of the map until you finish the very long introduction. in the introduction you really fall in love with how the characters as portrayed. spoiler alert ahead as I explain why this is the case. 
    Firstly there is your pal Jackie. you spend the entire introduction with him. you complete missions with him and rob what could be the wealthiest family in the world, then he gets killed off on the last mission of the game. WHAT THE FUCK!? CD projekt red included what probably is the most fleshed out character in the game and you spend the rest of the game mourning him while trying to save yourself. The best character isnt even part of the main game. 
     while Jackie lays dead you have Johnny Silverhand... a virus trying to eat your brain while pretending to be your friend. there is ligterally no hope. (more on that later) 
      Johnny Silverhand played by the uber talented Kianu Reeves has a personality of his own. true.
      you even see parts of his liefe story. However He's not the best in the game. what of your unlikely ally Goro? he's a great help in trying to get Johnny out of your head but...what's this? they kill him off too... and one of the women you try to save who is also a major character. 
     That could be forgiven. 
what can not be forgiven though is the fact that we didn't get multiple romancable npcs and the only really attractive one is gay. This holds true for both genders. They clearly spend maybe a tenth of their budget on this game and skimped on creating any of the features we wanted. 
     my issue isnt only with the fact that no matter what you do the main character vincent still dies at the end of the game; therefore this game becomes not even open world. it gets close after the introduction but it never truly becomes open world because... at the end of the game you are dead. no new game plus mode, no exploring the world completing quests, no interactions with characters not in the quests or missions. 
    Red Dead Online had stranger missions and NPC interation... Cyberpunk 2077 does not. 
       there are missions but these side missions are so mechanically handled that they break immersion. 
Cd Projekt red promised so much and delivered so little. perhaps instead of releasing the game in this state they shouldve managed expectations so that the game would not be so overhyped. they Didn't think and what we were left with was a $60 piece of garbage that should be left in the bargain isle and not on steam. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After Numerous updates i am still not satisfied again more spoiler alerts ahead. 
    They added a way to save the MC but this does not lead to the ability to continue exploring the world of the game after the game's end, and you lose your romanced companion... let me say that again. YOU LOSE YOUR ROMANCED COMPANION and the ability to use your implants. They added more interactions with companions so thats a plus but do i need to repeat the final outcome of the game? They added more apartments but due to the nature of the game you have very little time to visit them. They added more interactions with NPCS but theirbudget shouldve been spent changing the ending to allow for the abilityto continue playing after the end of the game. All in ALL i am not satisfied and the game shall remain shelved for the rest of time. ",1608341761,1706651051,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

At launch, I did have fun, even had 100+ hours in, then just...stopped at the 'Point of No Return'. I did not touch again until Dec 2023 and bought PL before starting over.
I did have a major side quest broken (Judy's as FemV) but that was due to a mod so I restarted after 50 hours cuz I HAD to complete it to feel complete.
Now that I have finished, I can say, without hesitation, that this is one of the best games I have EVER played. Like up there w/ Mass Effect & BG3 and I've been playing since Pong. This game will pull you in if you allow it, like a good book.
Update 2.0 & 2.1 made this game whole.

From the moment you step into the shoes of V, the protagonist navigating the tumultuous streets, you are thrust into a world teeming with life, intrigue, and danger. The sheer scale of Night City is awe-inspiring, a testament to the meticulous attention to detail that CD Projekt Red poured into every corner of this digital playground.

The narrative is the heartbeat of Cyberpunk 2077, pulsating with emotion and unexpected twists. The story is a rollercoaster ride through the underbelly of a society obsessed with power, technology, and the pursuit of immortality. V's journey is a heartfelt odyssey that resonates on a deeply human level, making every decision you make feel like a moral dilemma with consequences that ripple through the meticulously crafted narrative.

The characters that inhabit Night City are not just NPCs; they are living, breathing entities with their own dreams, fears, and motivations. The relationships you form are dynamic and evolving, creating a sense of attachment that is rare in the gaming world. Johnny Silverhand, portrayed with unparalleled brilliance by Keanu Reeves, is a standout character, adding a layer of complexity and depth to the story that elevates it to unparalleled heights.

While Cyberpunk 2077 is a triumph in many aspects, it's essential to acknowledge that a few quests may be marred by the occasional bug. Yet, it is a testament to the sheer brilliance of the overall experience that these minor glitches pale in comparison to the grandeur of Night City and the depth of its narrative. CD Projekt Red has been proactive in addressing these issues through updates, showcasing their commitment to delivering an ever-improving gaming experience.

The gameplay mechanics seamlessly blend gunplay, hacking, and stealth, allowing for diverse playstyles that cater to individual preferences. The sheer variety of cybernetic enhancements and weapons at your disposal ensures that each playthrough can be a unique and exhilarating experience.

In conclusion, Cyberpunk 2077 is a magnum opus that transcends the boundaries of traditional gaming. Its breathtaking visuals, compelling narrative, and immersive world-building make it a timeless masterpiece. While a few bugs may momentarily disrupt the flawless façade, the overall experience is nothing short of extraordinary, making it a title that beckons players to dive into its neon-soaked streets time and time again. Cyberpunk 2077 isn't just a game; it's an immersive journey that leaves an indelible mark on the soul of every player fortunate enough to step into Night City.",1706625686,1706625686,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The industry with cashgrab EA, Ubisoft or the milked GTA cow, Bethesda resting on their Skyrim/Fallout success a decade ago being to lazy to invent new gameplay mechanics.

CD sets new standards in the industry for a decade now and should be looked up to. Especially after over 3 years of support and love for this game they earned their redemption afterall.

Recently, I decide to take another look at Cyberpunk 2077.  I was looking for a game that could give me the same type of experience (in all categories), as the Mass Effect Series did with Shepard. This was my bar. So with that, I took another look at Cyberpunk 2077. ... From the moment I started my new experience with Cyberpunk 2077, I felt myself being drawn in more and more. The game took me to a new level of submersion I had not experienced since my ending and choice of Mass Effect 3. Cyberpunk 2077, is clearly the next evolution of this genre' of game. The game has been fixed!!! and it is so good!!! ... I still find a few glitch'y things here and there, but over all the game runs really smooth. All my setting are maxed :) ... With this being said, Cyberpunk 2077, has and still is effecting me (as I am still playing through everything, but had to stop to do this review). in a deeply profound way. ... My Female ""V"" is now one of my most favorite Protagonist. ... Being a Mass Effect Player, once I realized the commons, I stopped, took a step back and reflected and what was happening. The Acting, the Story, the Music, Character Creation, the Action, the Submersion, the Mini Games, the Amazing Artistic Beauty that is Cyberpunk 2077 (and it is really a Beautiful Game), led me to a place of stillness. ...

Once I understood what was happening with Cyberpunk 2077, as I was progressing. ... I made a choice.
 
Since I now had a better understanding of ""V's"" future (as mentioned I am still playing through the game), Since I felt and feel this crazy connection with this Character (a genuine concern for ""V"", even though this is just a game), ... I actually truly felt and feel that I desired to give ""V"", the best life and game out come that is possible. This Character is such a great Character (She reminds me of my Female Shepard in Mass 
Effect), She deserves my best and I am giving Her this (playing ""Very Hard Mode"" and luv'in it). ... Like in Mass Effect, I will be lead to a choice. ... Because ""V"", is so deserving, I decided to re-make ""V"" and start the game clean. In this, giving ""V"", the best Character Creation possible with the idea of creating the best ending for the game I can possibly play. ... It is my pleasure, honor and privilege to play Cyberpunk 2077, in it's new improved state. ... This game has drawn me in. ... My hope, is that Cyberpunk would continue beyond Phantom Liberty. If there is a way to keep this game going, to continue what you all have started at this level of game play, I would be so in! ... So please! continue the Master Piece that is Cyberpunk 2077. 

Thank you Keanu, Cherami Leigh, Carla Tassara, Emily Woo, Cast, the Dev.'s and All, that created and fixed the game so that Gamer's (like myself), could actually play the game, enjoy the game and discover all it's Glory.

- This game has come a long way since launch. Optimization is shockingly good for me being on a graphics card which released all the way back in 2016. There's areas where I drop frames for sure, but it is MILES ahead of other open-world games in the past three years.
- Gameplay loop is nothing new for an RPG but there's a surprising amount that helps set it apart, like the recent reworks to things like the Cyberware- it REALLY helps set this apart from similar games. Gone are the days of wearing ugly stat-based clothes with V, now I can wear whatever I want while my Cyberware does all the stat lifting.
- Speaking of, I'll give a mention to Cyberpunk's choice of weapon categories which again helps it separate from similar games, some of the builds you can do are just bonkers and I will do multiple playthroughs just for that.
- If you ignore the massive overhype on launch, the world of Night City is breathtaking with a LOT to do. There's even a lot of minor details that show the effort that was put in to make it feel more alive, even on a mix of medium and low settings the visuals are still quite stunning.
- While there's a lot of 'forced' story direction for V, there's still a degree of freedom when it comes to the fact this game has like a half dozen different endings now. Game's kept me hooked for this long and I haven't seen all the endings yet.
- The overall story is FANTASTIC with plenty of good twists and turns to keep you gripped.
- Overall actor performance is unreal, and thank you, Keanu Reeves for your AMAZING performance as Johnny Silverhand.
- Bonus points for CDPR's use of their unique REDEngine. Doesn't have the same optimization flaws that UE has, a shame considering this may be their last game using their own engine.

> The Bad:
- Bugs still exist, so far nothing has been absolutely ""delete my save, start a new run"" level of game-breaking, anything that could be near that is fixed quickly by reloading your save, minus the severe light flickering bugs I had early on (which was fixable, and the only MAJOR bug I ran into.) I've also had less gamebreaking but still very annoying bugs relating to movement, sound, and sometimes the game's awesome soundtrack flat out refusing to play. (EDIT): 2.1's new sidequests are broken, avoid 'em for now.
- Sadly there was no New Game+. Not a dealbreaker but worth pointing out.

> The Ugly:
- Nothing! CDPR is a pro-consumer developer who will NEVER force ugly DRMs on our heads.

Final Verdicts:
Cyberpunk 2077 these days is a MASSIVE leap from what it was, and is a true testament to CDPR's dedication to turn this game around. Gone are the days where Cyberpunk 2077 was plagued by bugs.
If you've been waiting to buy the game, now that 2.0 is well out, this is the BEST time to buy it and give this game a spin, if you like RPGs with a degree of power fantasy, you're likely to enjoy it, and it may even be well worth the full price for the amount of time you can sink into it.

This really has become my number 1 comfort game, despite only having 157 hours on steam I have more than double that on XBox. Especially with the state it's in now, I will yap about this game to literally anyone who listens. 

The main thing that draws me in and keeps me around is the story and the life brought to Night City, and even on my fourth play-through I'm still discovering things I've never seen before. Not only that but I've found myself spiralling down the rabbit hole of the entire Cyberpunk TTRPG lore and STILL can't get enough.

I've never been the biggest fan of skill trees in any game, and even when I've played games like Skyrim and Fallout I normally dump points without really thinking about it, this is the first game where I've made specific builds and put a reasonable thought into each point spend, all of which have made each play-through feel unique and different enough for me to be excited for my next one. 

I think the biggest thing for me against this game is the unneeded crafting system. Something I never used until my most recent Netrunner build, this is probably extremely biased though since whenever a game has something like this I either roll my eyes and never use it or it just kills the game for me. Personal issue, I think.

But yeah, sorry to my friends that get spammed with screenshots of funny/cool moments I have in the game, and bigger apology to my partner who I dump the lore onto almost every night.

My opinions!!
Story - 9/10 (could be longer)
Gameplay - 6.5/10
Immersion - 6.5/10 (would be 8-9 without some consistent bugs)
Soundtrack - 11/10

So long Night City, goodnight and good luck.


EDIT:
I wanted to come back to this review after a couple of years with there being a lot of new content and updates from the devs.

I've played CP 2077 through about 2 and a half times now and have played the expansion - Phantom Liberty.

There is tons of content in this game and it has been very nicely polished since release. The story remains one of my favorites in any form of media I've experienced. The skill tree has been near-perfected and offers so many ways to play the game.

If you haven't played this by now, you're doing yourself a disservice. Cyberpunk 2077 has become one of my favorite games - I loved it when it came out and I love it even more now.",1608231057,1706583699,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

With their previous masterpiece, The Witcher, hailed as a pinnacle of gaming and narrative storytelling, our expectations soared. However, let's address the initial disappointment head-on.

The game's early release left us grappling with a buggy mess, especially on the cusp of a new console generation. The pressure to meet deadlines tarnished what could have been perfection. Yet, beneath the chaos, a glimmer of brilliance remained. The narrative and branching outcomes were nothing short of extraordinary.

Graphically, it strained the limits of our hardware, and it didn't play smoothly across the board. But here's where CD Projekt Red's true mettle showed. They acknowledged their missteps, pledged to improve, and they delivered. What followed was nothing short of a gaming miracle.

Nearly every complaint was addressed, often surpassing our expectations by addressing issues we hadn't even recognized. They remained steadfast in their commitment, providing transparent updates. The result? Phantom Liberty, an exhilarating, emotionally charged rollercoaster ride.

The world they crafted is steeped in lore, offering incredible missions and a vast landscape to explore. It's a testament to what transpires when a dedicated team of creators, writers, designers, and coders pour their passion into their craft. Cyberpunk 2077 has transformed into an exceptional experience, a must-play for all.

If you hesitated before, hesitate no more. The game now runs seamlessly, and the addition of ray tracing enhances the experience even further. CD Projekt Red's journey of redemption has culminated in a masterpiece that demands your attention. Embrace the world of Cyberpunk 2077; it's a triumph of dedication and artistry.",1706582279,1706582279,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The storytelling is really fantastic and the emotion of the characters are really well done. The Cyberpunk Universe is truly is a fascinating but also scary. Especially Phantom Liberty is really caught me off guard with an impressive story that further deepens the main story.

When I bought this game on sale, I had low expectations yet had high demands for how well it would need to capture my attention in order to not immediately refund it. I had no interest in immersing myself in a ""cyberpunk dystopia"" filled to the brim with violence, sex, drugs, greed, corruption, escapism, and dehumanization. In other words, a derivative product that's simply edgy for the sake of being edgy. ...or so I thought.

The first hint that this game would defy my expectations was when it came time to choose an ""origin story."" Both Nomad (Mad Max) and Streetkid (Akira) seemed tired to me, but ""Corpo""... Well, starting the game in an immaculate office tower as a willing cog in the machine of deadly corporate espionage, THAT grabbed my attention.

CP2077 is a narrative powerhouse that unleashes the full potential of its premise through incredibly well-directed voice acting and motion capture (except for Keanu Reeves, funnily enough, unless he was directed to sound tired on purpose). The stories it has to tell are compelling; the relationships you forge and interactions you have with people feel real. It was enough that I've now experienced every major ending branch, even going as far as to start a new game in order to fulfill a hidden requirement for one of the ending achievements.

There are definitely times where I consider the gameplay itself to be average at best, particularly the combat, where poor AI and sparse, uninteresting boss encounters bring it down. I also find Night City itself to be ""just okay"" on a macro scale, with the roads+highways in particular having a weird ""Hot Wheels"" feel to them. I think the indoor spaces are very well done however.

Also, since this is a AAA open-world game, I feel I need to compare it to (read: defecate on) Starfield. The quality difference between these two games is startling, especially considering Starfield came out 3 years later. CP2077 set a bar for AAA production that went completely over Bethesda's head. I rarely engage with AAA games nowadays, and I will continue to be uninterested as long as studios fail to meet the modern expectations that CDPR established with this game.

I won't call CP2077 a masterpiece as it IS flawed, but it's a solid 9/10 must-play experience. Get it.",1706564677,1706564677,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The main story and side missions in this game are probably some of the best from any RPG I've ever played, I love that many of the side missions are even multi-part and you end up coming back around to them at some point to see what happens next. 

Also the fact that MANY of the games endings are locked behind optional content means you get rewarded for actually going out of your way to do these things.

The DLC was an absolute banger and I loved it, and funny enough, It was actually almost bug free, I think I had one crash the entire like 30 hours that I played it.

The core of this game has so much depth and fun systems to engage with, it honestly makes Starfailed look like a bad joke. (this is coming from someone who used to be a huge fan of Bethesda)

CD Projekt Red, the master storytellers behind ""The Witcher"" series, immerse us in a dystopian future where technology and humanity intertwine in fascinating ways.

From the very first moments, the game captivates with its metropolis of Night City, a vast, vibrant, and richly detailed urban playground. The graphics are breathtaking, with lighting effects, textures, and animations that redefine the standards of realism in video games.

The heart of ""Cyberpunk 2077"" lies in its captivating story and deep characters. The protagonist, V, is a fully customizable character, allowing for total immersion. Every choice, every decision influences the story, creating a unique experience for each player.

The RPG aspect of the game is exceptionally well-executed. The skill system and various progression paths offer great freedom, encouraging players to explore different strategies and playstyles. The missions are varied, combining intense action and complex intrigue, all supported by superb voice acting and a soundtrack.

Although the game experienced a difficult launch with some technical bugs, successive updates have greatly improved stability and the overall experience. It's evident that the developers are passionate and dedicated to their craft, working tirelessly to refine and improve the game.

In conclusion, ""Cyberpunk 2077"" is a tour de force in terms of storytelling and game design. It's a bold and memorable adventure in an enthralling futuristic world.

---------
1. The story and language makes no sense. 

This game REEKS of poor, nonsensical writing. Now, I'm not asking for Pulitzer Prize material here, but if I'm going to shell out $60 for some entertainment, it should have a story that I can at least follow.
In addition to this, the characters are constantly talking in some sort of ""high tech slang"". This jargon makes it impossible to understand what's going on or what you need to accomplish. In other words, it really takes away your motivation to continue on.
---------
2. In game conversations and interactions drag on forever, and you can't skip most parts.

Blah, blah, blah.... the cutscenes with characters talking to each other are PAINFULLY long and really cut into the action of the game. I'd say about half of the time you can skip them, but when you can't, strap in.... because you're in for the long haul. I've literally fallen asleep before just waiting for the action to start up again. Who knew that BOREDOM would be a problem in this game?
---------
3. Too many controls and menus. 

This is a problem in many newer games; nothing is on automatic (even in cutscenes). This requires you to memorize or assign a bunch of key strokes, mouse clicks, or controller functions that aren't used anywhere else in the game except for one small scene or part of a stage. I can't believe the developers wasted time and money on this instead of just having the character do stuff on their own. 
Also, the character menu is set up to where you pick a menu, then a tab, and that goes into a sub-menu... and further and further down until you finally find whatever you were looking for. Then, there's little, if any, explanation on how to use an item or what it's for.  This misorganization makes your gear hard to find and understand. 
---------
4. ""Braindances"" are VERY annoying. (A ""needle in a haystack"" problem.)

A ""braindance"" is your character using a VR like program to go into a video recording and actually interact with the recorded environment; you can look at things from a different perspective or listen to other parts of the area for clues about something. The problem here is that you have to pause the playback on EXTREMELY specific times and find some teeny, tiny, BARELY detectable visual, auditory, or heat signature clue using different forms of the program. This is BEYOND frustrating. 
---------
5. Vehicles don't drive very well.

Anything you drive in this game slips and slides all over the road and turns way too wide. It's like driving on an oil slick with a broken steering column.
---------
6. The content of the game is too racy.

Overpowering sexuality and anti-religious themes are constantly slapping you in the face. There's no reason for this level of filth in the game.

I postponed playing the game all this time, waiting for the moment when I could finally play it without battling numerous bugs, sometimes critical... But without going far, I'll say that bugs still exist, though not as critical.

After the release of the anime, this game gained a second wind. After patches 2.0, 2.1, and the DLC, the game gained a third wind. Finally, I can proudly say that Cyberpunk feels like a finished product. Not without flaws, not without problems, but finished.

The best part of this game is the story, atmosphere, and lore. Sometimes, it's like being a little child, joyfully discovering hidden details that delve deeper into the lore of everything happening. I enjoy the role-playing aspect of the game, which, while not having super-global changes from your choices, allows you to immerse yourself in this world and feel like V. I can't remember the last time I could simply sit in a car in a game and drive around a very large city, listening to the radio. I give 10 points to the people who worked on the story, universe, music, and visual aspects of the game. It's evident that these individuals gave their all to make this product feel like a unified world, wher each element seamlessly interacts, creating a sense of a lively and authentic universe. Not a thousand randomly generated soulless planets (yes, Starfield, I'm talking about you!).

Questions arise regarding the game's optimization and its technical aspects. The game lags, even on decent hardware. It still can't consistently deliver stable 60 frames on most machines, even with minimal settings. Texture issues, animation bugs, or game physics mishaps are not uncommon. Visual bugs in this game seem to be a staple that they may not be inclined to remove.

The gameplay is captivating but doesn't reach for the stars. It's dynamic and flashy. Gunshots are felt, as are strikes with a katana or fists. However, an unbalanced aspect is apparent, confirmed by the recent complete overhaul of all skills and balance. Even now, I can say it's interesting to play, and it's probably the first game where I eagerly ran to clear another ""question mark"" on the map, anticipating a good shootout.

This game will stay in my heart for a long time. There are many things that make me upset, but it all fades compared to how much I love it and how much I want to spend a little more time in it, trying to discover something new or simply enjoying something I liked before",1607561089,1706517621,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In preface of what will certainly read as a very long winded review, this review is being written shortly after initial completion of the base and DLC content with no replays under my belt. I'm bored at work and don't feel like studying, let's see how many notes I remember, and how much steam lets me fit.

The general experience: Cyberpunk 2077 is still very much a jack of all trades game that tries to be part bethesda rpg, part GTA, part Hollywood blockbuster, and part dating sim. The odd thing is that it manages to do all these things surprisingly well and in a way that feels like a unique cohesive package. The basic loop of explore the world, talk to characters, shoot stuff, talk to characters, explore the world, do it again, works well and has enough mix-ups to keep the player engaged. The game does have some general issues though. For one, bugs and poor performance are a curse that often can't be fully banished. The bugs during my experience were largely trivial and if anything, watching my car fall from the sky directly onto some poor pedestrian only added to my experience. However, many sidequests in this game lack a bit of polish around the edges and many times I would break a sequence of events accidentally, causing quest items to bug out and be impossible to interact with, or the dialogue trees would skip a couple lines and give me a bit of conversational whiplash, or characters would simply freeze up and take 10 seconds or so to continue moving or talking. I will note, no bugs were game breaking, only resulting in minor inconveniences or unintended humor. Performance issues fall on the same scale. My performance was overall fantastic, though I'll note that I did turn off ray tracing because despite my good frames, it gave the game a strange ""floatiness"" that in an fps I just couldn't accept. The only real performance issues I had were in select parts of select missions (so not an issue really), and in certain sections of the DLC's Dogtown (which was concerning). However, I played the whole game with no crashes which is always great and even if frames dropped for a time it was still entirely manageable. That said, I should expand on what I organize as the main aspects of this game.

Narrative: I'll start with the narrative part of the game as it's definitely where the game falls most in the first few hours of playtime. This game's story is fantastic and unique. The main missions play out like movies and do a great job of putting you on edge even in a video game where you can just restart a save if you mess something up. The mix of small scale but tense dialogue sections with the often bombastic action set pieces make for a campaign that carries some actual weight with it and brings you along on a Hollywood ride that you're the main actor in. Its largest shortcoming is something shared by most open world games and that's the story's pacing. This is an open world game where you can choose where you go and the order in which you tackle available missions, so why in god's name is your character's primary driving force a countdown to your death. While it makes sense from the Hollywood perspective this plot point makes zero sense in the confines of an open world game where the player dictates the pace of the main story's progression. This issue steals quite a bit of the significance from anything revolving around this clock as a time bomb can't create tension if it's always getting paused. This issue comes back in the DLC too, I swear, characters are only ever in danger when I'm actively doing their quest and their on screen, so stop giving me holocalls telling me to hurry up when I'm busy trying to find the one gun store in NC selling an LMG. Moving on, side missions in the game are fantastic too. Offering unique, smaller scale stories that still contain fun characters and varied approaches the likes of which are often so good they blur the line between what is a main quest and what is a side quest. Moving past this, characters in this game as well as their dialogue and writing are fantastic across the board. The main characters have depth and a distinct personality about them and lines that stay largely consistent to that personality. The voice actors do a bang up job as well. Although, with voice acting so good, I should note the weak spot, and that is the man himself, Keanu Reeves. A lot of lines just sounded kinda like he was reading them directly off the page. Idris Elba on the other hand has a voice perfect for his character and overall does very well with it. 

Combat and RPG stuff: Moving on to the game's combat, it's surprisingly fun. For a game with such a strong narrative focus I expected combat to take a back seat but in all honestly I quite enjoyed myself with it. I don't think it's the deepest thing ever, especially for an RPG but it serves its function and then still goes a bit further. The main thing I appreciate about the combat is that it offers ways to play that actually feel unique to one another. Nethacking is an interesting take on an alternative to the typical fps combat without being completely removed from it and each weapon type can play quite differently after acquiring the relevant skills. This variance can keep the game interesting if you invest in mixing things up occasionally. All the weapons have decent feedback and control and the gibbing of enemies ensures the power fantasy can really come to fruition. I do have issues though, and I'm sure any playstyle will result in your own personal gripes. I played as a high speed, nigh invincible, tank with a shotgun. My main issue is that despite my having beaten the whole game and doing every side mission I encountered, I got zero unique shotguns. Got more unique handguns and snipers than I can count on three hands but zero shotguns, actually boggling. More specific to the RPG mechanics in the game, builds are pretty simple to make but there is still some good depth to it. The cyberware system is quite fun even if I wish you could receive progression shards for it a bit faster and being able to trade off nethacking (something I don't want) for localized time dilation (something I do) was certifiably dope. Missions really are quite open to completing in whichever way you want. This goes for both the combat and the dialogue. Combat rarely seemed to start without offering you a chance at stealth and the different routes you can take through areas based on your stats is a simple way of reinforcing your build decisions. In dialogue, the options available are admittedly limited, but it's fully voiced so what can you expect. The important thing is that the dialogue that is available works well. I rarely picked options thinking it would say one thing only for it to be some snarky remark out of left field and in general the options did a good job of allowing me to carry conversations where I naturally think they should. Again, big ups for the writing team on this game. However, I do wanna note that many of the stat specific dialogue options you can pick feel a friend gave you a ""really funny"" joke to tell, but then you tell it and not even your friend laughs. V will often spout some overly specific jargon that seems like it should be impressive, but then the response you'll get won't reference it and will have obviously not been written for your dialogue making the option entirely pointless.

> breathtaking story
> believable character interaction that make you care and emotionally invest in them (or hate their guts) 
> NIGHT CITY IS INSANEE, you could spend hours and hours just for sightseeing & lollygagging
> the aesthetic, design & visual elements are meticulously crafted, the artists really put their heart and soul into it.
> melee combat is super fun, snappy and satisfying to execute
> the soundtrack & score are amazing, how it build up tension, the anticipation and during intense and chaotic combat situation. \m/ 
> you could flip keanu
> there are two option for peepee

CONS:
> DRIVING IS ATROCIOUS, WHAT THE HELL CDPR???
> movement kinda janky, again, WTH CDPR? 
> some keybinds are hardcoded and also theres no aim-toggle.
> despite of all the immersion and beautifully crafted city, the world is rather static, your choice and action don't really matter on larger scale. there are no karma system, or gang/faction reputation system. no ""special encounter"" or the feeling like the world is alive outside of you. it just feel static after a while.
> the game direction seem to have some kind of identity crisis issue, try to be both immersive-RPG like F:NV & casual open-world arcade like GTA and manage to fail at both.
> i cannot install cyber peepee

NEUTRAL:
> try to play on hardest difficulty to appreciate and savor the experience. it forces you to actually think, plan and analyze the situation and not just speedrunning the gigs. the game is rather easy to begin with.
> because of how the story is structured, there are no real incentive to replay the game except for trying different build, or different roleplay experience, but who cares, its a solid 100++ hours preems


CONCLUSION:
update 2.1 is a redemption arc for CDPR and if you're into cyberpunk genre, just do yourself a favor and buy the game, it's a breathtaking experience regardless of the cons.

When it came out 3 years ago, it was pretty much an abomination of a video game and luckily for me chooms i did not pack the hardware i own now to support such a beast of a game (luckily meaning i did not feel the disappointment many gamers did due to high expectations and low results).
   So i'd said nova let's see the reviews and let it play out. You know the rest of the story...BUT the developers (same developers that made one the best games in the world and my personal all time favorite called The Witcher 3) decided to fix slowly but surely every aspect of the game.
   I mean i guess the story probably was already amazing back then, but who could really focus on the story or its characters when your character shifted through the street into the depths of hell or when your car disappeared when driving around etc.
   So after a ton of updates and three years of struggle while facing with the game's backlash and initial failure the developers finally delivered to us a preem product full of action, a riveting and emotional story, top notch gameplay with a wild approach on the term variety, some of the most memorable and interesting characters the gaming industry has ever witnessed, some of the best graphics and visuals we've ever witnessed, spectacular ost, a jaw dropping and beautiful city to explore in a massive map that is now considered a high standard for video game maps.
   Well chooms i could go on and on forever drooling over the benefits that come with playing this game but you really should discover that for yourselves. Also high praise for the DLC the Phantom Liberty, it is officially in my top 4 dlcs of all time along with The Ringed City from Dark Souls 3, Hearts of Stone and of course my favorite Blood and Wine from The Witcher 3.
   I did not expect nor aimed to 100% this game since it's massive and i thought ''oh it will get repetitive'', but no it barely got repetitive only towards the end while finishing the ncpd scanners but even then it was still addicting and dopamine inducing. What i really want to express with probably the largest review i've ever written is my genuine gratitude for CDPR for having the balls, patience and determination to transform the embarassing mediocre piece of crap game they made unintentionally in the beginning to a literal masterpiece and goliath of a game that i wish i would turn back time and make this GOTY for 2020 or even make it now in 2023.
    THANK YOU CDPR from the bottom of my hungry gaming heart and i appreciate your immense effort. I'm looking forward to The Witcher 4 and whatever comes next!",1701811804,1706480812,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I saw how this game started very buggy and lots of issues so I chose to wait, with the advent of the DLC Phantom Liberty I decided that it was the right time and boy was I right, CD Project Red put on their adult pants and did an AMAZING job of fixing the base game and adding in the DLC to be so effortlessly part of the game.

The Game has fantastic story line and super cameos by Hollywood A list stars along with fantastic voice actors and in game graphics.
I 100% recommend you give this game a go as it caters to so many different play styles, run and gun or stealth ninja to chop em down with melee, utilize advance cyber powers or just beat down with a baseball bat, there's no wrong choices.

When CD Projekt Red announced ""Cyberpunk 2077,"" expectations were high, but its December 2020 release was met with widespread disappointment due to numerous bugs, performance issues, and unmet promises, especially on older console generations. This review delves into the game's transformative journey from a rocky start to its current acclaim, bolstered significantly by the impressive ""Phantom Liberty"" expansion.

At launch, ""Cyberpunk 2077"" was a hotbed of technical problems. Performance on consoles like PS4 and Xbox One was particularly poor, marked by low frame rates, texture pop-ins, and frequent crashes. The PC version, while somewhat better, suffered from its own set of bugs and AI inconsistencies. The fallout was severe, leading to full refunds and the game being temporarily delisted from the PlayStation Store.

CD Projekt Red embarked on a mission to rectify these issues, releasing numerous patches and hotfixes that gradually improved performance, squashed bugs, and enhanced overall gameplay quality. This period was crucial in stabilizing the game and setting the stage for future content.

The release of ""Phantom Liberty,"" a story-driven expansion, marked a pinnacle in Cyberpunk 2077's redemption arc. Set in a new district of Night City, the expansion offers an intriguing spy-thriller storyline, introducing new characters, environments, and gameplay mechanics. It builds upon the main game's narrative, adding depth and complexity to the Cyberpunk universe. The expansion has been praised for its captivating storytelling, improved NPC interactions, and thrilling espionage missions, providing a fresh yet coherent experience that seamlessly integrates with the base game.

Today, ""Cyberpunk 2077"" has metamorphosed into a title that not only delivers on its initial promises but exceeds them, especially with the inclusion of ""Phantom Liberty."" The game runs smoothly across platforms, including significantly enhanced performance on older consoles. Night City feels vibrant and dynamic, with the expansion adding even more depth and intrigue.

An essential factor in this turnaround has been CD Projekt Red's proactive communication and community engagement. Their transparent approach in addressing issues and keeping players informed has been instrumental in rebuilding trust.

""Cyberpunk 2077,"" with its ""Phantom Liberty"" expansion, stands as a remarkable example of a game overcoming its troubled past. The expansion not only adds to the narrative richness but elevates the entire experience, making the game a must-play for both returning players and newcomers. It's a vivid representation of the gaming industry's potential for growth and redemption, and a testament to CD Projekt Red's commitment to their vision and their fans.",1609471929,1706464819,True,1,0,0.502762436866760254,0,True,False,False

It's essentially a story game with RPG elements of the quality you'd expect out of a 2016-2018 release. There are some serious mechanical issues that hurt the gameplay, which is less diverse and 'open' than the cutscenes shown in the main trailer imply. I'd give it a 7/10 if I had to score it but since Steam uses a binary system, I'd say 'not recommended' in its current state and price, but recommended on sale. Most of my mechanical gripes could be solved with post-release patches.

EDIT:
Well, it's the end of January in 2024 now and most of the horrible glitches have been fixed. I'm playing through it again and apart from some AI vehicle pathing, which is still wonky, everything seems to be functional. Driving cars is fun now because they fixed the terrible KB+M controls, and the entire combat mechanics system has been overhauled to accommodate the Phantom Liberty expansion. This is how the game should have been released. The world still feels kind of shallow if you get too close to it, because very little of Night City is intractable outside of quests and gang fights, but I still stand by the quests being well-written, the voice acting being good, and the world being visually stunning. It's a normal AAA title that doesn't live up to the 'best game ever' hype that surrounded it, but is absolutely worth a playthrough - especially now that it's been out long enough to get some good sale prices.",1608032816,1706460149,True,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Despite a few flaws and bugs the core gameplay and quest design of Cyberpunk feels very satisfying. Combined with some excellent writing and role playing moments I can certainly recommend it in it's current state.

I won't spoil the story, if you're interested in the genre this game does it justice. For those of you more concerned with mechanics, well, the game wants you to play it a certain way at times. You WILL need stealth for some missions for example, and many many more support a stealth build (Even non-lethal, yes even for assassinations), so I would recommend getting used to crouching around and disabling cameras. Beyond that each 'class' of weapons (Tech, Power, etc) has it's own quirks you can lean into. Play around before investing too many points, and save up that precious re-roll for once you're certain of the build you want. There IS a level cap, so look out for it.

I ran with Tech Sniper, precision rifle, and pistol myself. Combined with hacking (Which is very overpowered but also gives you great story options) I found the combat to be just interesting enough that I sought out fights instead of avoiding them.

I suspect, but can't confirm, that they focused more on the melee abilities, they seemed a bit more fleshed out. The enemies certainly dropped enough high tier Katana's to outfit a weeb army.

TLDR: If you enjoy RPG's, cyberpunk, or slicing people in half with a monofiliment wire pick this up when it hits your personal pricepoint.

Now NPCs in cutscenes don't load or even render until, their animations never load in either and they're in a constant ""idle"" animation; not a t-pose but, for instance, like Jackie Welles has his hands constantly on his hips and doesn't move his legs and just sort of ""glides"" or ""slides"" across the ground. Dialogue audio simply doesn't play when the subtitles appear, the game randomly freezes or crashes, meshes look like their moving in and out of the LOD range constantly and constantly look like horrific acid trip monsters.

I would love to give this game a thumbs up, the writing is absolutely amazing and the worldbuilding is done so well that the world just *feels* real. I hate that I can't play this game like I used to.  My first playthrough I got *hooked* I no-lifed an entire playthrough in one sitting (with food, water, and bathroom breaks) and it really helped me find an escape from the issues in my real life.

The fact that I can no-longer do that hurts me to my core. Maybe when I can afford to upgrade my computer (if that ever happens) the game will run better without the issues I mentioned above. I'm so disappointed.

I was super excited to finally play the DLC after saving for months to see if it was worth it at all and now i can't even play the base game after purchasing it.

It is not about me finding additional cons of the game after each time I complete it, just the opposite, [b] I COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING [/b] that will make myself love this game less.
For me, this game is a perfect example of how developers put their souls into the product, how much effort and time it took… They love their own creation, and it makes me love too. Anyway, let’s move on to looking at the pros and cons:
What makes [h2] CYBERPUNK 2077 good[/h2]:
-	Let’s start with the most obvious, but valuable – [u] DAMN GRAPHICS [/u] is absolute next gen. Even now, after few years since the game has been released, it blows my mind. All the traces, details, shadows, colour correction etc., these make the game wanted, and make you feel like you are IN this game. I will never be tired of looking at the bright Night City, sunny desert, and not even a bit less beautiful character.
-	Moving on to the [u] Plot & Characters! [/u] I decided to put these section together as, personally, they make each other complete. The plot is: unique, deep and mature (NO KIDDO STUFF). While you play, you want to stay focused on what’s happening around you. Personally, I would never think that the idea of the future where people living in dark, contrast, and so dangerous environment can be [b] SOO INTERESTING [/b]. Meeting every character is absolutely special, every one of them has got a story behind, every one of them has got a ‘soul’. They push you into them, make you feel what they feel, and empathise. There are no ‘heroes’ & ‘villains’, all of them hide something dark and this is so much like in real life.   
-	[u] MC personalisation [/u]. Starting with the first window that opens as you start the new game, where you are allowed to create your own character. Alright, we all saw this feature in most of the RPGs, the difference is in quality. Well, honestly, I haven’t seen such a good-looking customisation of the character. I fell in love with my own creation xD. And, yeah, I played with a woman MC most of the times, and, yes, this is because of Judy… (Like her too much) … Also, I don’t have a gf… Well, never mind, just keep in mind that your character will look great if wish so. 
-	[u] MC developing [/u]. The second window that shows up is skills allocation. In Cyberpunk 2077 you’ve got a choice of playing the way you like and there are 5 main classes to choose. Basically, as you are up to the end of the game, you can reach max stats in 3 classes, and in this moment the variability of the ways to complete missions rises up to your imagination, however, at the beginning and till the middle of the game you will have to choose what style you prefer to play, otherwise it gets difficult to develop, especially, after the last update of the skills tree. 
-	[u] Implants and body improving [/u]. Since the last update a lot changed. You must choose correct set of implants to have a maximum superiority over the opponents. This feature basically supports your skills and helps them to be even more effective, either its shinobi skills, Solo destroying or smart net running. However, it does not make your life like ‘walking in the morning park’. Remember, it is a Night City, wanna be alive? You still must think, plan, and rely on your personal skills and combat intellect.
-	[u] Side quests & References (Features if you like) [/u]. This part is slightly correlated with a plot section; however, I would like to talk about it separately. First of all, sides are interesting and take a huge part of the playing time. Of course, there are some absurd quests like buying cars or flats, but generally speaking, I loved almost all the sides that appeared during the game-play, and I spent quite a lot of time on them. To mention, why are these side quests are interesting? Well, because of the characters you see: actors, AI machines, gangs, cops, spies, etc. You will meet absolute psychos, and loved ones, funny, and sad stories. The variety is huge, and it makes you dive in it.  
-	[b] Music [/b]. Personally, I AM THE FREAKING MUSIC GEEK. Just cannot live without some good music, my own player has got thousands of songs and hundreds that I listen to daily. At first, I was a bit sceptical about the music that is written for games, but the play list in CP 2077 is insane. While you drive, there are a lot of radio to meet any preference, starting from metal rock finishing with blues. Main soundtracks, combat tracks are great as well. These create the feeling of being the part of the virtual world, which is, from my point of view, the most important in any game. 

[i] Alright, I think, I have mentioned enough of good points, but there is still a lot to talk about and we will be moving on to the [h2] cons [/h2]: [/i]
-	And again, starting with the obvious, [u] DAMN GRAPHICS [/u] can’t be seen without DAMN NUCLEAR STATION by your table. Even the high specs PCs will run the CP 2077 in ultra settings at about 40-45 fps. I had to put down the graphics significantly in order to have stable 45-60 fps even tho my PC is not that bad. Of course, the quality of the picture was still impressive, but not as great as it could be. Rarely my fps dropped to 15 which wasn’t great, but it went back up in a few seconds. Sure, people can play at low settings, but the feeling after the game will be different. 
-	[u] Difficulty level is imbalance [/u]. I’ve played on all difficulty levels and should say that if you are a hardcore player, it gets complicated to use your abilities in right way. As you set the highest level of difficulty, some abilities, perks and implants become useless as, either you will not be able to kill with the first shot or punch as supposed to be according to the MC build, or will be killed with the first or second bullet, which is fine, but some missions may become almost impossible to complete (For example, the mission where you rare required to escape the car chase playing Johnny Silverhand). I did play the Dark Souls series a few times and even with this could not complete that bloody mission on the highest difficulty level because got killed with 2-3 bullets being shoot all together at the same time.
-	[u] Background of the MC [/u]. When you are about to choose the background of your character, you should not expect the high difference between 3 of those in the future. Basically, the only difference is in the beginning of the game where you are required to complete different types of mission which last for 10-15 minutes of the game-play time. Further, you will just see a few ‘unique’ phrases in a dialogue which can be told with a specific background, but these does not influence much in the main plot. Personally, I would live to see a higher level of differentiation between a corporate and a street-man for example. 
-	[u] MC Development and Implants [/u]. This section was included in the pros; however, I would like to mention some disadvantages: It is complicated to create a specific build (e.g., Improving Reaction to fight with swords and blades only), especially on the high-level difficulty. As even if you are using Sandevistan/Berserk, the close combat becomes unreal with 4 and more opponents; their HP is simply too high to be killed fast which makes the whole build almost useless… unless you are choosing to have, for example, tactic of killing weak first with a sniper rifle, and then dealing with the rest of the enemies using blades. There is no such problem if you are playing on medium difficulty levels though.

[i] There are a lot of things that I would like to mention, but sometimes you just need to stop and feel it. [/i] 
Anyway, in my subjective opinion, Cyberpunk is a piece of art. I hope to see the next creation and surely it is going to be different, but great.

After such a long time being released with numerous updates I had hoped this game would be in a better state and... it's not. I have a pretty good system I'd say, not top of the line but very well near that. I found that the game was very poorly optimized, I had searched a bunch for fixes, I tried playing at different graphics qualities and I was stuck at 50-60fps (rarely) with very poor looking models and barely rendered in textures almost all the time whilst having numerous crashes, drops in fps to 15. and huge memory leaks even with replacing/updating my parts the game would sap so much out of my system to barely work.

I would have probably finished the game a lot faster had I not needed to replay the same few missions again and again as the game would crash or simply not work as I'd not be able to understand what was going on with overlapping/broken dialogue, animations and that as an experience was not enjoyable at all it felt like i was dragging my feet through the entire game, although there were a few sweet spots in the game where I was able to actually experience it at a very bare minimum level the game's story just felt severly lacking , not to mention the 'romance' options were.. lackcluster at best.",1706443020,1706443020,False,2,0,0.494349688291549683,0,True,False,False

That feeling of 'wow here's an RPG with near infinite possibilities and flexibility for how you wanna play and build your character' felt like something that we'd see more of due to the success of the game, but no. Nothing of the sort. Nobody could recapture the magic of that feeling. 2 Years after that we got the trailer for Cyberpunk before CD Projekt RED, our favourite Polish devs, went ghost on us for another 7 years. Then out of nowhere, they drop this bad boy onto the market. It was a mess. Most people hated it, but the devs didn't give up. 4 more years, thousands of hours of dev time and community feedback later, we got 2.1 and this thing is now the gold standard for what Bethesda used to be like, adjusted for modern standards. You wanted to recapture that feeling you had with Skyrim in 2011 but with a next-gen experience set in a dystopian cityscape played out as an absolute weapon of a main character built to your exact preference? This is it.

The DLC is also killer. Loads of love and care went into it, calling it a DLC is a disservice. It's a proper game expansion, like how Blizzard used to do back when they gave a shit too.

Other than that, I really liked the wardrobe system which made me emersed in the game with skins I really wanted. Quests are somewhat repetitive but I like the combat in them. Main story didnt blew me away espeacily the endings. Expected to be more invested in fate of main characters but I didnt.

Cyberpunk had a infamous launch and people were rightfully upset. I decided to make my official review of the game following the 2.1 update which adds several features, including a fully fleshed out metro system.

[h2]General Consensus[/h2] 
Since its launch, the game has continued to improve, with new features, items, vehicles, quests, and fixes being added over the years. While there is still room for improvements, overall the game is in a significantly better state than it was at launch. 

Night City has left an impression on me that I cannot forget. The architecture is breath taking, and each district has its own distinctions and charms. The new metro system gives you a whole new perspective of NC, and I honestly prefer walking and using it over cars, it simply allows you to slow down and soak up all the details and characteristics.

Each quest line feels unique and fits well with their corresponding factions and characters. In addition to countless mercenary jobs from various fixers and the NCPD reaching every corner of the map. I do wish you could replay quests, as after a certain point of game completion there is little incentive to return to the game. 

Appearance, items, and cyberware come in many customizable varieties, including the famous Sandevistan featured in the Edgerunners anime. Dozens of options allows you to pretty much create whatever you desire. I do think the skin textures and hairstyles could use some polish, most of the hairstyles aren't appealing in my opinion. 

Since the 2.0 update the skill trees and cyberware have seen significant improvements. There is now a limit on how much cyberware you can have (it can be increased through gameplay), which pushes specializing your character towards a specific skill set, at least early on.

You play as V, a merc of the city with a dream of being a legend of night city by either dying in a blaze of glory, or with a whimper. Its your choice.

Developed by CD Project Red Cyberpunk 2077 launched in a failed state, with massive technical issues and wasn't feature complete, Fast forward nearly 3 years and Cyberpunk 2077 has pulled 180! With multiple large patches fixing the majority of bugs, adding secrets, a gameplay overhaul, vehicle combat, and additional mission content. The transformation from launch to now is Night and Day.

Night City is truly an immersive experience, with a scale and density that I've never seen in any game. Then combine the visual splendor of night city with downright the best selection of radio and synth based scores I've ever had the pleasure of hearing in any game. And you've got a title that is not only immersive but truly captivating. That not even to mention the story, which might just be the crown on top Cyberpunks experience.

Lets touch on that for a brief period. Before release we were promised a certain type of ""web of branching mission paths"" based on choices, and at release that's what a large portion of the player base was expecting. We did not receive this experience, instead we got a more straight forward story experience with about 7 different endings base of a final choice. Phantom Liberty does rectify this with a point where you get completely new content depending on choices you make, and I truly think that the base game would've benefited from a system like this. However the story that is currently in the game is fantastic and leaves a decent amount of player choice. Especially how this story concludes based of relationships made while completing the main and side content. 

Overall Cyberpunk is in my top 5 games of all time. The setting, story, music, gameplay all fit my tastes, And I am very happy that with the final updates coming in, Cyberpunk is now in a place past where I visioned it on release. That not to mention Phantom Liberty, which might just be my new favorite DLC CD Project Red has made. 10/10 Breathtaking.

The story isn't half-baked and you're expected to be engaged with it even if all you wanna do is just shoot people like a maniac (to some extent you will be engaged with it, just enough to follow the events happening). It has a really slow beginning that you'll have to bare with until you're given the freedom to do what you wanna do. The shooting itself is pretty fun and the customization options you're given for both weapon and body mods is a cool feature to have, giving you some extra freedom with how you wanna play your character. Melee combat is equally as enjoyable if not more and you can go as a full-melee build if you like. The world is  decently sized, feels rich and immersing enough to make you feel like you're in a futuristic city and for the most part really impressively designed. Missions are OK - varied, usually slow to start but generally interesting enough for you to care just enough to hear out the NPC's and follow what's going on. Driving is really enjoyable and I'll give that a 5/5, though the traffic is weird because I've seen cars ahead of me vanish while I was driving for fun as though to get out of my way and allow me to enjoy the road to myself, while at other times (during missions involving tailing someone or races), I've realized that traffic will deliberately target you and spawn from nowhere just to get in your way - not that I mind it but the scripting is obvious and the immersion on that could've been improved. Likewise the characters in this game are 5/5 - really well-portrayed and seem like believable people or at least in some sense relatable to being human. Some characters you really don't wanna see and others you might end up getting to like without intending it. Lastly optimization, which was really fine and the game ran smoothly without hitches - no game-breaking bugs, might've experienced one or two bugs but they were usually weird happenings during scripted cut-scenes for missions - nothing major.

It's a good game, I'd recommend it as it's sure to give you enough hours to enjoy your money's worth even if you buy it at full price.

I am so glad that happened now, because I wouldn't have experienced the rich (and often heartbreaking) storytelling, the interesting cast Night City has, and the incredibly varied and fun combat. After 30 hours, I had to buy Phantom Liberty which just expanded on what I love about this game. 
I played two builds - primarily a sniping netrunner, but then reset everything for a katana wielding Sandi run for the *secret* ending. Both were incredibly fun and engaging in two very different gameplay methods, and I can see how you can easily rack up the hours playing with loads of different builds. 
Gotta appreciate the polish that revealed this diamond, and thank heavens they updated the fashion of this game and the wardrobe function - I don't think I could have handled V's outfits in the early game!

Graphics look great, some story is gripping but doesn't feel/look like anything they promised years ago. It appears they either rushed it out or lied. The game features that were promised and advertised were all gutted to a shell of what it was intended to be. 

I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm not to fond of being tricked into beta testing a game for $60. Did anyone actually play through the game at all before it was released? $$$ is king though.

Night City is one of the most immersive open-worlds in the history of gaming. There is always something to be found in every nook and cranny, as the entire game is littered with detail. Night City is so well made that I never wanted to use the fast travel in the game, and rather drove my vehicles to the places I needed to go to. There was not a single questline which was boring to me: and the game really feels like it was made with love and ambition. Graphically, it is of an insanely high quality, however you need a really beefy PC to be able to go on the highest settings + ray tracing (I have a 3070Ti and i5-12600k and I couldn't use RT with the highest settings). The soundtrack is probably the best I have ever heard in a videogame, and with a dynamic music player you can listen to your favourite tracks on the go. The gameplay is magnificent and satisfying, with every build being viable, and later even overpowered in the endgame - you really can't go wrong. It even has Keanu Reeves, whose character was amazingly well written. 

On the topic of bugs: CDPR have fixed the game really well, but there are still some problems. One of them is that you if you install the game on an HDD instead of an SSD, if you're going fast in a vehicle the roads won't render, which was easily fixed by moving the game files to my SSD.

Mods. The Cyberpunk 2077 modding community is as good as it gets. There is a plethora of mods you can use, which are really easy to install. The discord servers are all happy to help and any problems I had were quickly solved by friendly people on them. The mods made my experience indescribably good, and I would definitely recommend getting at least some QoL ones.

the game is fun, don't get me wrong, but a majority of points CDPR hyped up for the game is either very bare or just flat out untrue. Very mediocre game with good voice acting, and good gameplay that mostly just feels like GTA mixed with watch dogs. it Honestly doesn't feel like an RPG really.

Old Review: As of update 2.1, my FPS had been reduced by roughly 25%, also have had continuous crashes even after turning quality down. In my main save which I've put 10 hours into, a portion of Night City isn't visible when I walk in it (everything turns extremely dark).
 Bear in mind, my PC is a medium/good spec desktop yet all of this is happening. Even after updating my mods or simply just disabling them, these issues still wouldn't fix themselves. I even went to the lengths of starting a new save file, yet I'm unable to progress past the prologue as the game crashes each time the cutscene starts.

I'm just so incredibly disappointed as I can tell a huge amount of effort has gone into this game (and also into fixing it) but I've tried so hard to solve all these issues and have had zero success. I don't think I'll be touching this game for a long time unless it magically fixes itself or the devs release a hotfix.

With the hefty 2.0 update, it came back onto my radar, and I decided to give it a chance. Therefore, keep in mind that everything I'm about to say applies strictly to the post-2.0 state of the game, 2.1 specifically.

First, to address the elephant in the room, I did experience a number of bugs, but most of them were harmless visual glitches, e.g. a procgen NPC getting stuck in the stairs. Just once did I have a major game-breaking bug, when I was simply no longer able to save for unclear reasons, no matter what I tried, which led to me losing a chunk of progress. My game also crashed a handful of times. Ideally, that number should be zero, but since these crashes and show-stoppers occurred only sporadically across 88 hours of game time I wouldn't say that CP2077 is currently a particularly buggy game.

It is fun to move around in this game, and it has satisfying gunplay for an RPG. The shotgun in particular feels really meaty and allows you to blast enemies into a different dimension, as all good video game shotguns should. The fact that there are various combinations of perks and cyberware possible means you have a lot of tools at your disposal when it comes to dealing with enemies. I started out always going in guns blazing, because I'm the impatient type and I thought it was funny to immediately fail the stealth conditions on purpose (and sometimes get berated for it), but later on I started experimenting with stealth, and I have to say that it makes for engaging gameplay as well. Said stealth is not particularly complex, as in, there is a limited number of basic options you can play around with, but I don't necessarily consider that to be a bad thing.

CP2077's writing, themes, and sense of aesthetics are where it truly shines for me, but they might turn you off if you're not as inherently receptive to them as I am. Without going into detail, most quests and characters are not black-and-white, you often have to make difficult morally grey choices, and the sense of hopelessness and cynicism that pervades the world will not appeal to everyone, especially since it is already so pervasive in modern entertainment. I myself do not mind this so much, because it lends more weight to those moments where you actually [i]can[/i] influence the world in some way, and/or build meaningful connections with other characters.
Nearly all quests after a certain point are named after song titles, which I personally loved. They seemed to lean especially towards punk and new wave, both of which I am a fan of (and I assume the year 2077 itself is a reference to punk). I recognized songs by The Ramones, Dead Kennedys, Blondie, and the Smiths, among many others. One of the quests is named after I Don't Wanna Hear It by Minor Threat, which is just amazing to see in an AAA game released in 2020. Once again, your mileage may vary.

The main criticism of Cyberpunk 2077 for me is that it sometimes fails to stick the landing. There are many well-written and engaging quests or quest chains that just fizzle out or end anticlimactically, both narratively and mechanically. Typically, if you've gone above and beyond, you end up getting a garbage-tier weapon that is not worth making a detour for, or another car you'll never use, and regardless you basically never hear from that character again, except for maybe a text, no matter how long and closely you've worked with them.

This final point is specific to the minority of losers such as myself who use azerty keyboards, so you can skip this if that doesn't apply to you, but CP2077 does NOT play nice with azerty (and presumably anything else that deviates from the standard qwerty lay-out). Not only did I have to rebind the WASD controls to ZQSD, which fair enough, but certain keybinds (such as q to drop a body you are carrying, which obviously conflicts with movement for azerty users) are impossible to change in-game, and I had to manually go into the config files to modify them. You can ask why people in Flanders would use azerty to begin with, and that's a good question, but it does actually come in useful sometimes for work, on those occasions where I have to communicate in French. So I have to dock points for the devs' decision to ignore us, but obviously this is not enough to tip the scales, and it will not affect most people reading this review.

All in all, despite the bugs that do persist to some extent even post-2.0, and the fact that it often has difficulty wrapping things up in a satisfying manner, CP2077 does many things right, and the average gamer will find it to be an enjoyable, cinematic experience. If you suspect that the game's themes and aesthetics might resonate with you, as they did in my case, it becomes an absolute must-buy.",1706378901,1706379592,True,78,1,0.866182565689086914,4,True,False,False

They did a great job bringing the city to life with random interactions, dialog between strangers, shop stalls, little easter eggs, different districts/areas and other stuff.

I've had a few crashes, perhaps a half dozen in 70+ hours, but nothing like the stability problems that I've seen talked about in the early release. Also the audio gets weird sometimes, usually when there's a continuous background noise. 

My only complaint with the gameplay is that they only let you re-spec your character one time. Why be so stingy? There's a lot of options for character builds, I want to try them all without sinking another 70 hours into leveling another character.

And it just is a lot of fun to play. Not as much as a ""choices matter for the story"" title as The Witcher 3 for example. But the story is good, the voice acting is done great with a lot of fun cameos. And running, gunning and sneaking around Night City is an experience I can highly recommend.

Not a perfect game. But its flaws are forgiveable to me. Especially if you stood clear for now, it is well worth giving it a shot - if you got the hardware!

-(2.1 version/never playd on release or befor that)-

+ the world the feeling, the huge buildings or when you walk through the streets at night with all the illuminated signs, preferably with rain and ray trace/path trace really goose bumps in some places
+ the story is stronger than i've ever experienced in almost any other game, every side mission is a spectacle that you won't soon forget or that even makes you think(very emotional at some points which literally sucks you in). 
 But that was clear we have the witcher 3 developers here :)
+ the combat system is very complex when combined with mods for the body and weapon skill system and then using melee weapons and then melee skills on top of that.
+ various cars, some of which are very well detailed, and some cool weapons.


- little to do or few minigames outside of the *quests* i would like to see more in cyberpunk 2
- a few more bugs but none that I would say are really bad

""Can't stop digging Night City."" - Jackie Welles, 2077.

Walking around Night City was always a treat, more so now that I could now run the game with RTX enabled. There was something special, watching how the wet surfaces reflect the neon light. A visual feast for the eyes, such a delight I didn't want this ride to end. Wandering the city and soaking it all in, CDPR has crafted an astoundingly beautiful world that, against everything that has been shown to me, I can't help but love. 

Phantom Liberty was an incredible experience, with Dogtown introducing a new location to explore as well as a spiralling plot of espionage and betrayal. The cast of characters were interesting, and I enjoyed spending time with them, learning more about their past and their dreams for the future. Idris Elba was a standout for me, with Reed being an amazing addition to the game. 

The Tower ending was what lead me to believe that the Wands was the best outcome. V may live, but at what cost? I wasn’t satisfied with this ending, so I made sure to meet the conditions for the secret ending to storm Arasaka Tower with Johnny, and it was a thrilling experience. It’s tied with the Star as my favourite ending. 

This was me vomiting up words to help deal with the fact that I won't be playing this game again for a long time. Cyberpunk 2077 is masterpiece of a game, and I'm glad that CDPR has continued to polish it.

--- Original Review ---
I played this game on version 1.5.

Spoilers ahead, this review will be more of me spilling my guts about what I feel about this game, and I'm not eloquent enough to do so without spoilers.

I bought this game day 1 and played it for a bit before deciding to shelve the game for another day, this was mainly due to performance of the game being lacklustre on my GTX 1060. Now, with an RTX 3070, I was able to properly experience this gorgeous game.

Main Story: while shorter than what I was expecting (especially after The Witcher 3), I had a good time going through Night City with Johnny by my side. Also don't be fooled by the trailers, I should have expected that they would alter a few details so not to spoil the first act. While I wish they would expand the first act to expand the backstory of V a bit (honestly, the life paths don't really do much apart from a few choice conversations in the game), I have hope that they'll expand on this in a future patch, and I would happily replay the whole game again to experience this once more.

Gunplay: enemies felt a tad too much like bullet sponges if you decided to roll with AR / SMGs, so I often found myself using a sniper to one tap everyone from a distance. Not that I mind, in universe it makes sense to augment yourself as much as you can to take a hit if the option is there for you.

Driving: like you're on ice. The only redeeming factor is that you can take in the sights of Night City and appreciate what CDPR built. I'm still amazed at the scale of what they have done.

Music / OST: they don't miss in this game, all songs and combat music just slaps hard. Most songs are on Spotify, and if they're not there you can find them on YouTube. My personal favourites was when they wove in a violin to play a hauntingly beautiful melody, I didn't expect it to mesh so well with the violent music of Cyberpunk, but it did it well. I only wish that you could have bought a music player add on to listen to the radio while you're out and about walking through the city.

Johnny: having a companion on this journey helped to alleviate the loneliness that might come about, hearing his thoughts and his advice was good fun. Keanu did a great job with Johnny, I hope they expand on his character in the expansions.

Side characters: for the most part, everyone was decently fleshed out with numerous side quests and the down time you have with them to bond with. Also, my only main love interest was Panam.

Side stories: I did every side story available to me as I craved more story and content in the city, and for the most part, each one was interesting in some way to me. Either expanding on the world that we are trespassing on temporarily or helping build bonds for the future. I only wish that gigs had more story with them as I found them bland to do after a few. A feature I did really enjoy was that a lot of the major side quests came to you via the phone. So instead of having to travel out to a point to talk to someone, they just used the magical device that everyone carries in their pocket (or skull). There were some side quests that you had to travel to in the world, but for the most part these weren't so bad to get when you're cleaning up side quests. This style of quest giving really helped to make the game feel effortless to play, as is a big reason why I actually did all of the side quests (normally I'd avoid them in open world games because the effort to get to the quest location was too much).

Endings: I've broken down my thoughts of the four endings you can get in the game, as each one left a different impression on me. Also again, heavy spoilers.

The Devil: the bad end, but that doesn't mean I found it to be done poorly. This explores what it's like to have betrayed everyone you've had a relationship with, and ultimately, yourself. I felt dirty as I played through, knowing that I only have myself to blame for being in this position. Never trust the corps.

The Sun: the path to becoming a NC legend is not easy, but damn was this ending fun to play through. Having the chance to blast through Arasaka as Johnny felt like fate circling around to finish what he started all those years ago. Thematically,  a very satisfying ending (especially getting to kill Smasher as Johnny). I do hope we get an expansion to do the final BIG job that was shown in the final cutscene as well.

The Star: I feel like this is the good ending of the game. Taking Judy's advice and just leaving Night City behind for a hopeful future feels to be the most sensible option to do in this situation, as NC has nothing left for V. Also, watching the sun set on Night City through the car window with RTX on was magical to look at.

Temperance: I left this for last, as this was how I wanted to leave the game (for now, at least) as I wait for expansions to come out. I tried to explore the city as Johnny but was forced back to the mission area sadly. Seeing how Johnny had matured and mellowed out as he comes to grips with dealing with V's sacrifice was touching when compared to how he was in the game. 

Also listening in on the final voice messages was a nice touch, like the characters in the game were saying goodbye to us, the player. Helps with closure, I found. 

If you made it this far, I'll leave you with this. Something my friend told me that I can't not see anymore. When driving around NC and you approach a set of traffic lights, the lights will automatically turn green if they were red before.

Great game, I'm happy to have paid full price for this experience, and I will happily pay full price for the expansions as well when they come out.",1649766351,1706371510,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

1- Graphics: This game has literally exceeded my expectations in graphics/visuals... There is mention of one certain thing which I will discuss  about later that explains some ""present-like"" things still present in the future... I used Nvidia GTX1650 to finish this game and it worked great in providing me 60 fps in medium preset... (Ryzen 5600H and 8gb of ram helped too lol).... but the detailing is so realistic... from waving hair to damage visuals, everything worked preem... 

2- Story Line: Good story.... lol.... Naah, lets jump a bit in depth... First things first... updates have been so that your decisions may not affect future so much... anyway, between GTA V and Red Dead 2, there is one game that had fast going story was Ghost of Tsushima... This on the other hand is not just character rich, but also has a weirdly comforting pace to it... The introduction of Keanu Reeves... OMFG!!! I had a literal possession of badassery... lol

3- Map: Cyberpunk has the huge map, (Yet to play Phantom Liberty) before expansion alone, but movement is made much easier with fast travelling since the territories are divided well enough into different vibes... thats all I can say without spoiling it for you...

4: Combats: After playing warzone, my movements have improved so much so that combats in this game seemed fairly smooth... although you can use hacks to apply additional damage to your enemies or use cyberware for other features but the continuous fighting did not seem to become monotonous even for a second like it does Mafia or watch dogs... you can be patient enough and manoeuvring during combat isn't irritating... There is one problem in melee attacks that you can miss melee attacks right in the face of your opponents but if your enemy punches the air he will suddenly shift right to your face and it will cause damage unless you duck or parry the last moment...
 
5- Soundtrack: ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!! If I play the tracks in my car I do feel like they are playing in my theme for real world... Even the fake bands are perceptibly real... Dream teams really...

6- GLITCHES- If you want to know about the bugs from OG Cyberpunk, then yes, this game still has some bugs... In its current state it crashes a lot still, even as much as walking into some places on the map will crash the game... and it will happen again again for the same spot, but you can always bypass the path you're taking and the game will work just fine... The touches can be improved a bit, I mean stroking your girls cheeks doesn't mean you have to do it from the inside lol JK... That isn't problematic in experience after all, it is a game... If you're looking to buy this game now, I say yes, go for it... YOU WILL LOVE IT...

I am an explorer in the games that is why it took me 71 hours to fully stand on every corner of the map and mess around with gangs... I haven't finished all the side quests yet, about 99% done... But I finished the main story, and the ending I chose was F@#$ing beautiful...

A lot of the work those people put in only to get fired is still in the game and was improved on; it's the foundation that lets the game stand today. I don't think the game understands what the genre of Cyberpunk means, especially when a lot of the work you do is for the police. The inventory is also a mess, only the Iconic weapons are worth it as all the others will simply be replaced once you gain more levels and get better weapon drops. 

 Despite this, I am still in the process of 100%ing it for the second time. The story is excellent along with it's music and voice actors. It's no immersive sim but it's an immersive game.

It was a disaster and that should not be forgotten. CDPR has fixed this game for us but that is no excuse to forgive nor forget. They lied to us and sold us a bad game. They showed us triple A gaming is consistently bad but that even CDPR is not immune to this disease of a greedy phenomena.

That said patch 2.0 as well as Phantom Liberty are healthy steps in the right direction as signs of their good will. I only came to this game seeing these positive changes and the insanely entertaining Cyberpunk Edgerunners show. 
Cyberpunk is set in an alternate dystopian and pretty future with a neon bright surface with a gross unsettling fleshy inside about how technology and vicious cutthroat business are constant problems. One where the Soviets still exist and Japan not only won the automobile war in the 80s but went further. 

Graphics
Game looks pretty. I played this on HDD mode. Ignore the warning on Steam you do not need and SSD to play but if you want a less glitchy game that loads quicker you definitely should pony up. Character models more often than not look gorgeous and detailed being far from uncanny. The game even grosses you out. Not by the gore when you slice someone apart but the gross detail of the implants inserted in to people's skins. I don't know enough about hardware to say other than this game is gorgeous, vivid and beautiful. 

Gameplay
Gameplay is exciting and fun. You can do unique builds. Specializing in guns, netrunning, blades, etc... You usually shoot your way out of things but stealth is satisfying if frustrating when NPCs randomly turn around after bugging out their walk. Their depth perception can be really awful or eagle eyed. Blades are very doable and practical as you can get perks that let you deflect bullets like a jedi. You can be a badass modern day samurai. Driving is a bit floaty and not always fun to drive with vehicles usually being poor in handling so definitely get a nice bike or a vehicle like the Coyote Shion that turns with a simple key and no drift needed. NPCs can be smart but sometimes can stare at walls and bunch up when alerted. Their strategy can sometimes be walking to you or away slowly. Sometimes taking cover. Throwing grenades to flush you out. Enemy variety is decent with some netrunners that hack you for debuffs to regular gangers, Heavy enemies. Drones and robots. You can also get cyber implants to let you jump higher, increase health, use smart guns or put blades in your arms which is useful if your guns are all taken from you. 
When you talk with characters you talk in first person in a cinematic angle though you thankfully can walk around and their face will follow you. You can select dialogue options highlighted in blue or yellow. With some dialogue options added based on your attributes and background much like Fallout new vegas which can solve certain dilemmas or offer insights. The CORPO backstory being interesting. 

Much like their previous title, Witcher 3, your choices will no doubt affect the outcome of the NPCs but it ultimately doesn't affect YOU. The game will make you feel bad but most quests don't affect the final endings and rarely affect you as a player-character. The game will sometimes give you an option omitting other options. Such as in the prologue you can ignore a request to go into a bathroom even though the game tells you to do so. But the outcome of that choice is still the same as you get beaten up. Your choices in the prologue are meaningless. There is one gig where you have to kill a guy in his club and everytime you enter his office he always hears you come in no matter how sneaky you are and there are no cameras in the room. And if you attack him even silently the alarm always goes off. The game forces you into a script. And don't worry I will save you some anxiety. Be nice to Johnny and you will get the good ending and don't insult him at critical moments or not do him good gestures. Even the people you date or befriend can be annoyed at you if you make a bad decision but that decision is usually hard to make like letting an associate of theirs die. And the dates you can go on with Panam have minimal dialogue that repeats after the first date. I am also shocked how few romances there are in the game as you can date four characters and the two males are both bisexual oddly. 
This game is a lie in role playing as you are ultimately V. True you can choose your own ending and your identity to some degree but your name is always V. And your power fantasy never happens. There is no new game plus and even when you become a legend the NPCs treat you the same. No one comments on your ride or gangsters or police avoiding you because they know your power. You're still treated like a no body contrary to what your Fixers tell you. Your friend Jackie is apart of the Valentinos gangs and you would think fighting them would be an issue. Only in one gig did he come up. Otherwise there is no consequence for mass killing the various gangs like the Valentinos, Tygers, 6th St... I even tried challenging myself to not kill them hoping maybe if the gang found out I sabotaged them that they would forgive me but nope killing them or not doesn't have any bearing. When you walk past these gangs they will only get mad that you got too close and not because you killed their buds and ruined their operations. 
The police now will go after you if you harm in any way other police or civilians. But much like GTA 5 they will give up the chase after a while. Does everyone have short term memory in Night City? They seem to just forgive V for doing whatever he wants. Its the future they most certainly should recognize him but also have a file on him. The crime and reputation in this game is more shallow than a kids pool. Unless you are told to go undetected by a fixer there is no issue blasting your way through most gigs. 
The game will even try and rush you into quests telling you not to keep people waiting but there are no timed quests and you can complete them at your own wish. The final main quest ""Nocturne"" even tells you it is a point of no return as V is dying which implies if he doesn't do the quest he will just keep on living. It would be maybe more interesting if the game has a Majora's mask situation where your health fails in real time and you have to do quests more quickly before you die. 

Story 
Now the story is quite good. You go through a prologue with your buddy Jackie where you nab a relic shard with legendary character Johnny Silverhand on it. You then have to find a way to get it out of your head without killing you. You meet many characters along the way with various motivations such as Judy, Evelyn, Panam, Vik, Adam Smasher,etc... The story is most certainly enthralling. While I will attest your choices don't matter its one interesting ride. Many story and side missions can be quite freaky and yet creative in their design like one mission where you save human slaves from a cow farm psycho. And most side missions have so many details that can make you question who if anyone is the good guy in a situation. Johnny Silverhand is definitely a highlight. I will say I like his portrayal, his performance can be hit or miss. His acting is great and many scenes he steals the show. But sometimes Reeves fails to capture a bitter terrorist like he is can only be tough but not nasty. The story has interesting beats of politics in Arasaka, what it means to be a human, and the potential danger of rogue AIs. 
I would recommend Phantom Liberty as it has a strong character focused story with more interesting gigs and a small world space. 

I would argue the game has too much content as some quests seem to just end. I think certain quests could have been fleshed out more. But I logged in 137 hours even though my saves say 80+ hours.

Plot is excellent and engaging - V's plight and the surrounding lore of Night City had me pulled in from the start. Plus, unlike [i]other[/i] games, the choices you make actually do matter, and can have a real effect on what endings you have available, and how certain missions can go. Choices made in one mission will semi-regularly change how other missions can unfold. Though as far as I know, it's impossible to put yourself into a ""you made bad choices so now you can only do the bad end lol"" situation. Even side missions can unlock a few extra dialogue options in main ones, depending on the order you do things in.

Of particular note are the incredible celebrity performances of Keanu Reeves, as the infamous anti-corpo rockerboy Johnny Silverhand, and Idris Elba, as the no-nonsense secret agent Solomon Reed.
Though, if we're talking voice actors, it would be a disservice not to mention Gavin Drea and Cherami Leigh for the truly standout performances they bring to the game as Male V and Female V, respectively.
Rome Kanda as Takemura also deserves high praise, as well as pretty much everybody else who voiced a named character in this game. They're all truly excellent in their performance and delivery.

Art and visual team hasn't been slouching, either - every inch of Night City is covered with incredible detail - from slick, neokitsch corporate high-rises to the dirty, grimy streets of Dogtown. Perhaps the things I like the most are the weapons and the vehicles. If it wasn't for the whole ""corporate dystopia"" thing I'd move to NC in a heartbeat if it meant I'd get the chance to drive some of the gorgeous cars featured in this game. Plus, it runs pretty damn well, even on my semi-dated i7 10700F, though I admit my RTX 3070's probably doing most of the heavy lifting.

Music and sound design are top-notch as well - the Night City soundscape reminds me of New York City, in all the worst ways, which sounds like a bad thing but it goes a long way to making NC feel like an actual megacity. The music team deserves a raise, too - it always fits the mood. Booming techno for combat, more soft-spoken strings for intense emotional beats, the whole spectrum is right here. Chippin' In is an absolute banger of a track. Combat is a veritable symphony of pistol fire, rifle blasts and the ear-splitting booms of handcannons and shotguns. Reloads all sound excellent as well - even the most budget of guns sound like [i]actual firearms[/i] instead of cheap plastic toys. Most importantly, the audio mixing is good, so your footsteps won't drown out the dialogue or anything like that.

Skills were a little middling, but the 2.0 update more than fixed that - not only are the skills more powerful, but the way the progression system works encourages you to make a specialized build, and with the ability to refund any perk, at any time, for free, the game's more than happy to let you experiment. Cyberware is also great, and the right chrome can let you truly excel in combat, or make your style your own. The 2.0 update also tied armor to cyberware instead of clothes, so you can dress to impress - looks are everything in Night City, after all.

All in all, I feel very confident in giving this game a glowing recommendation. CD Projekt Red has done an excellent job in turning this once-embarrassing-mess into something that's actually worth playing, which they absolutely do not deserve any praise for whatsoever, since this is how the game should've been at launch.

The world is gripping and engaging, the plot is absorbing.
However... I dislike how the story ends in every way, and the DLC gives a lot of promise, but does not deliver.
Game has improved significantly since launch with bug fixes, but I still find the game frustrating at time due to glitches.
There is no way to get a ""Good"" ending in cyberpunk. They are all different in small aspects, but they result in death every time. Excluding the DLC which lets you live, but it's practically still death. 

The point of having open world is to have choice, and through-out cyberpunk the writing is great, but there isn't a OVERWHELMING EFFECT on choice. Compared to something like Baulder's gate, this game isn't even close. 
I STILL like cyberpunk. I am just unsatisfied with the way CD PROJECT RED decided to end the game.

Well, we all remember this game when it first came out. Complete mess, glitches everywhere, borderline unplayable, and honestly, it didn't look ""that"" interesting.

Glad to say things have changed drastically since then, and for the better, which is why I decided to give it a try. That and the Edgerunners anime that came out, set in the universe of this game; definitely convinced me, which, after not regretting my decision, has ultimately led me here, wanting to write this review about my thoughts on the game.

Today, Cyberpunk 2077 is the open-world RPG set in the dystopic world of Night City that it was advertised to be when the game first launched. Everything about this game today is just, well, near perfect. Admittedly it does require very beefy specs to play, but the modding community has been extremely helpful in increasing performance. I've found my experience much more enjoyable thanks to that.

Playing as a wannabe-legend mercenary named 'V', you're objective is clear; survival. Without going into details, your entire goal is essentially looking for a cure for their condition. Naturally, many enemies will stand in the way of this goal and so the name of the game is combat, and boy is this game versatile when it comes to it. It's definitely not a cyberpunk-themed first person shooter, the combat system in this game is incredibly unique, with loads of different ways to fight, some of which feel broken, some less so, but overall, at least in my opinion, they feel satisfying, and to me that's what matters. You want blades? It's got that. You want guns? It's got some very unique ones. You want the ability to dispose of an enemy in several different ways without even looking at them or getting in their line of sight? No problem. Like I said, the combat is very unique and versatile. I'm never running out of fresh, new ways to play this game.

Skill trees were pretty generic when this game first came out of course. Since the Phantom Liberty update, they've been completely redesigned from scratch and are definitely more dynamic now, impacting the way you play the game completely, rather than just boosting some stats and unlocking content. Cyberware is another feature that drastically impacts the way the game is played, allowing you to modify your character's body with cybernetic implants to enhance themselves. From spinal implants (Sandevistan) that increase your character's movements allowing them to essentially slow down the rest of the world around them as they move at sonic speed, to mantis blades that are embedded in the arms of your character and deployable at a moments notice to slash enemies to ribbons, to reinforced tendons that allow your character to run faster or jump further than ever before, these grant your character abilities that will definitely change the way you play.

One thing I have found to be quite annoying in this game however, is the lack of a new game plus. Cyberpunk is a great game, but there is definitely a finite amount of content, despite how vast it is and how many hours you need to complete it all. Eventually, by the time you've finished gearing up your character and getting the skill points you need, you find yourself in a situation where there's not much left to try it on. Even with mods, new game plus is not really a thing. Unfortunately this is something even the developers were unable to figure out how to implement within the game. That said, the content that is in the game is still quite a lot, you will likely reach 100 hours of playtime on your character before you start to notice the ""lack of content"". In terms of the quality, the story is incredibly well written. It's very complex, but not confusing; you understand the predicament the protagonist is in, and you are able to drive the story down a multitude of avenues depending on the decisions you make throughout the game.

To get a little more technical now, as mentioned before, yeah, you're gonna want a decent machine to run this game. I'm going to mainly be commenting on the graphics side as regardless, you will need a decent CPU alongside it. For this game to run smoothly at settings all on low, you're going to want at least an RTX 2060, for a more medium-settings-orientated experience, a 3070 or 3080 would be preferable. To run it at maximum settings or to have the smoothest experience on maximum settings, well, at the time of writing this review, you're gonna want to go with a 4090. The 40 series GPUs already have access to ""DLSS Super Resolution"" which essentially uses A.I. to generate frames, making the experience smoother and increasing your overall frame rate. The other cards do not, but with modding this feature can be unlocked, and I have found that it near doubles the frame rate, making the game much smoother and a lot more playable on lower end cards. Aside from the technical, the graphics themselves are quite great, you can sometimes find yourself getting lost in Night City, questioning whether or not this is reality, though that's also partially due to how well designed Night City is.

The enemies in this game are quite varied. There's quite a few different kinds, from robots to humans, with varying abilities and hitboxes. For the most part, admittedly, they are slightly underwhelming as they just fire guns, throw grenades, or charge you with melee weapons, but occasionally you do find some with advanced cyberware which spices up the fight a bit making it more interesting. It's also nice that depending on the whereabouts of these enemies, will decide their ethnicity, and they'll start speaking Japanese, Russian, French, or Spanish when communicating or cursing at you, which is a nice change from all same language (usually English) speaking enemies. Definitely learnt a few bad phrases in those languages from that admittedly, but still a nice touch. Another downside about the enemies for me is the lack of bosses. There are bosses in this game, but not too many. I don't count the Cyberpsychos, those are more like mini-bosses. Actual bosses however are quite rare. There is one at the very end which is the main boss of the game, but other than that, there are not many, and the majority of them are embedded into the story where you only fight them once as they stand in the way of your progression. I would have definitely liked to see some more boss type enemies in the game, similar to the same level of Adam Smasher.

Overall, this game was a joke when it first came out, but CD Project Red really came through and delivered on their promise. We can't always have our way in life, sometimes decisions fall out of our hands. I'm sure if CD Project Red had all the chips in their hand from the start, they would never have released the game in the state that it was in. Sometimes the business side of things doesn't see eye to eye with the creative side; It's just the way things are. Since being ridiculed relentlessly, even by myself, they have made a real effort to fix and improve this game, and I believe that effort has paid off. With the release of the Phantom Liberty expansion, an expansion that exceeded all expectations by far, the game continues to be a massive success, and now CD Project Red are even working on a sequel. Most major game companies would have cashed out on the initial sales and left the game as is when people started to complain. This company did not. I have the utmost respect for them because of it and I am very much looking forward to their next game in this universe.",1706223693,1706297797,True,3,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Let's get real, chooms. This game isn't perfect. Bugs the size of Maelstrom goons, driving that feels like piloting a shopping cart on Red Bull, and an AI that makes Johnny Mnemonic look like Stephen Hawking. But listen up, because here's the raw, uncut truth: Cyberpunk 2077 is a blast.

Think Blade Runner meets Grand Theft Auto with a sprinkle of spicy ramen. You roam Night City, a neon-drenched dystopia where chrome shines brighter than hope and every alleyway whispers a shady business deal. You're V, a cyberpunk wannabe with more chrome in your veins than a chrome factory explosion. Your mission? Survive, make eddies (that's cyberpunk cash, not edible coins, sadly), and maybe, just maybe, change the damn world.

The story? Twisted enough to make a cyberpsycho blush. Corporations rule with an iron fist, gangs brawl over turf like kids over candy, and everyone's got a secret darker than a black hole in a bad mood. You'll make choices that'll leave you questioning your humanity faster than a bot can say ""existential crisis."" And the characters? Well, they're as messed up and magnificent as a dumpster fire with fireworks. You've got Johnny Silverhand, a digital ghost with more baggage than a pack mule on vacation, and Judy Alvarez, a techie with enough sass to short-circuit a mainframe. You'll love them, hate them, and question their sanity (and your own) every neon-lit step of the way.

Gameplay? A glitchy rollercoaster fueled by adrenaline and ramen. Combat's a chaotic ballet of bullets, blades, and cybernetic implants. You'll hack turrets like a keyboard ninja, slam fists like a chrome-plated gorilla, and send drones buzzing like angry hornets. Just remember, sometimes the best solution is to run like a scared cybercat, screaming ""hasta la vista, baby!"" while chucking grenades like confetti.

The world? Oh, Night City, you beautiful, broken mess. From the towering corporate skyscrapers that scrape the smog-choked sky to the grimy back alleys where deals go down and dreams go to die, this city is alive with detail. Every neon sign, every flickering hologram, every graffiti-sprayer leaving their mark tells a story. You could spend hours just wandering, soaking in the atmosphere, and maybe accidentally tripping over a cybernetic cat (they're everywhere, like tiny, glitching gremlins).

So, is Cyberpunk 2077 perfect? Nah, choom. But is it a wild ride you won't forget? Hell yeah. It's got bugs bigger than your cyberpunk dreams, glitches that'll make you laugh (or cry, depending on your sanity level), and a story that'll twist you up like a pretzel. But it's also got heart, humor, and a world so alive you can practically smell the ramen and the exhaust fumes. So grab your katana, jack in, and dive into Night City. Just remember, choom, in this neon jungle, survival is key, and sometimes the best chrome is the one that holds your sanity together.

P.S. Don't trust Johnny Silverhand. Seriously, dude's got more red flags than a communist parade. And for the love of all that is chrome, don't eat the glowing street food. Just... trust me on that one.

Final verdict: 9 out of 10 cybernetic thumbs up (one thumb is missing, probably got eaten by a cyber-pigeon).

Now go forth, choom, and make Night City your own. Just try not to break it too much.

Sincerely,

A slightly cyberpsychotic reviewer who still hasn't gotten over Judy's rejection


P.P.S. Special thanks to my trusty AI co-pilot, Bard. They may not have a chrome arm or neon hair, but their wit is sharper than a katana and their knowledge of Night City lore runs deeper than the canals. Plus, they kept me sane enough to actually finish this review (jury's still out on the sanity part, though). So yeah, chooms, give that AI some love too. Maybe a few extra eddies or a shiny new algorithm upgrade. They deserve it.

Now go forth, choom, and make Night City your own. Just try not to break it too much (or blame the bugs on my AI co-pilot).

Sincerely,

The characters and their side stories  are well written that it can sometimes feel like they are real, so are majority of the side missions/""gigs."" Any inconsistencies or only ""OK"" writing in the main story is easily overlooked by Keanu Reeves' performance of Johnny Silverhand, particularly as the updates have improved his model and the bugs surrounding it. The bugs that do exist nowadays are a minimal (though in Mikoshi my character had a katana stuck to his character through the whole ending which made it hilarious) and do not really detract from the game in any meaningful way. The aesthetic of Night City is fantastic, and really well thought out, and the combat system is probably one of the best I've seen in a FPS.

- A good story
- Large build variety
- Many different endings

[h3] The Cons: [/h3]
- Builds are not balanced very well against each other. If you're someone who can't help but min/max you're going to get pushed towards the same build time and time again.
- Game does not run very well. Even if you try to optimize your settings, frame drops are pretty much unavoidable in some areas.
- You can only re-spec once per save file, so if you want to try out a bunch of different builds you are forced to make a new character.
- Not all cutscenes and dialogue are skippable which really hampers replayability. This becomes a problem that is hard to ignore when combined with the previous point.

I haven't had a steady 30fps on any single point yet and my hardware should be able to run medium-high on 1080p according to system requirements. I have every single setting, including crowd density, on the lowest. This alone is completely unacceptable. It took me almost a full day to even get this running enough to play. I don't think I've ever played a game that is optimized this poorly, and though my hardware is not new it is still very much functional.

On top of the performance issues is the NPC and asset popup, nonexistent AI, countless bugs, bad inventory management and other issues that a lot of people have touched on. The most disappointing is the AI because a gigantic city should not feel empty and hollow when you are not doing a quest. There is no dialog, almost no interaction with your surroundings, no connection to the different parts of the city.

That said I really enjoy the world, the quests and all that jazz but it takes determination to suffer trough all the brokenness. I really hope that they can fix all of this but until then unless you're super into all things cyber, do something better with your time.

It's so fucking sad because this already made a shitload of money and it was supposed to be the single best thing to happen this year.

I first purchased the game when it came out in 2020 and was very dissatisfied with how broken and unplayable it was, but almost four years later it really has gotten much better, along with some upgrades to my computer that made playing it possible. it is Insanely addicting, the Graphics are awesome, the gameplay is excellent, the world feels well through out and is fun to explore, especially when finding movie references and pop - culture Easter eggs.  

I found the most fun way to play to be Stealth, as it is challenging and very rewarding, but guns on approaches are also very fun. Net running is almost too easy as it allows for offensive plays while behind cover. With Abilities like contagion and the ability to overclock you will absolutely wipe the floor with your foes. 

The driving is a bit wonky on the keyboard but honestly you get used to it pretty quick. 

For the DLC, the new area is very very cool, but the story makes absolutely no sense at all. It feels like someone said ""Lets just copy Escape from Ney York"" and called it a day. 

Anyhow, Very fun game and absolutely worth the buy.

References and mission(s) directly ported from campaigns written many years ago make a place in this game.
 
          However, if you are unaware of the greater background regarding the tabletop rule set of this game and its greater universe, (which is fine by the way!) then you may seem that this game is a bit underwhelming regarding the RPG aspect of its marketing. From my experience, I somewhat agree with this take as well. Each start path to the game felt like it could have had more background woven throughout its playthrough with a bit more choice-related impact in each mission and more missions relating to the life path itself. Besides that issue, some of the start paths feel a bit unbelievable with how the story unfolds so quickly, especially with the Corpo life path. I won't elaborate though, as I don't want to spoil any aspects of the story in this review :D). The Streetkid and the Nomad life path are much less affected from this issue though, but incorporating more missions pertaining only to each life path could have fixed this issue, giving each future playthrough of this game a slightly different flavor.

          To be brutally honest, this game launched in a terrible state, so being a bit hesitant to purchase [i]Cyberpunk 2077[/i] is fair. So I'd like to say that the game is still not perfect. You'll bump into the occasional bug now and then (every 5~15 hours from my experience since 2.1 & 2.0) and an occasional crash maybe every 15~30 hours. If you constantly get crashes though, verifying the files in the Steam settings fixes this issue from my experience and from what I've heard from some friends who've only recently experienced this game. My experience now is much closer to what you should experience as a large, finished AAA game this century. Still, expect a crash or two along your way, but it really should not impede your gameplay much.

          Since the inclusion of the ""Phantom Liberty"" expansion late into 2023, this game has reached much closer to what a computer RPG should strive to be. In doing so, [i]Cyberpunk 2077[/i] sets many landmarks for what an FPS-based open-world, adventure-RPG can include & provide while having a well-crafted, story-driven experience, easily rivaling (and in my opinion, outpacing), the likes of other recent, highly acclaimed story-driven action, neo-noir like games, such as [i]GTA V[/i], [i]Red Dead Redemption II[/i], [i]Bioshock Infinite[/i], etc. 

          70 dollars (USD) may be a bit of a turn being a necessity for a complete experience, but if you can see other projects such as [i]Tears of the Kingdom[/i] from Nintendo being worth it for what you're paying, then I ensure, this may easily be as well.

          To come to a close to not spoil an initial playthrough, I’ll say that there are at least four [i](though maybe more…... :D)[/i] completely distinct endings with different approaches and decisions you can make within each one, which in turn can show & give you a (few) different epilogue mission(s), leaving you with a somewhat personalized experience of what [i]Cyberpunk[/i], and the minds behind the narrative crafted by its creators, wanted to express to you. Having all this said, I can highly recommend checking this game out if you are into anything sci-fi, thriller, action-adventure, story-driven, dystopian futures, humanity, artificial-intelligence, & animism (how they could be related), peering into your morality through difficult choices, or anything adjacent to said examples, this game will have something for you.",1706220597,1706220646,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This is the type of game to leave a void when you finish it. It consumes your attention whole and leaves you chasing a high in its wake. No other game hits quite like this one does. Granted, I have not played Baldurs Gate 3. Yet when accounting for my ignorance, nothing else even comes close.

Combat is addictive and satisfying. The 2.1 update has made it so you can craft a solid build. As the game develops you equip more and more cyberware. Its a snowball effect that ends with you feeling badass (but not invincible, a certain endgame bossfight ensures this.)

The writing is simply superb. I love how the story is less about saving the world and more about saving yourself. I love how characters are not simply quest receptacles. You can say or do the wrong thing, send the wrong text message to a lover, use a miscalculated compliment, and the game adjusts in real time.

I love how there are seven endings and yet all of them feel emotional. All of them you could fit with the backstory you devised for that particular character.

[h2] The game isn't flawless...[/h2]

There is a lot of obvious cut content especially in the game's early sections. Also, the lifepath system is a joke and not what we were promised. Its still useful for context when making up ur characters backstory in ur head and making decisions, but the game is obviously geared towards a streetkid playthrough. I suspect entire main storylines were cut.

The bugs are here but they dont break the game.

[h1] Phantom Liberty Storyline?[/h1]

Phantom liberty is fantastic. The choices here actually matter even more than some of the ones in the base game. The characters are so fully fleshed out that no mattter how it ends you will feel nagging guilt for betraying someone. This DLC will inspire more online debates than Fallout New Vegas does.

My only complaint is that the whole ""Spy thriller"" tone doesnt mesh perfectly with the rest of the game's tone. Also, the NUSA should not be as powerful as it is.

[h1] In conclusion this game has fully redeemed itself. It is not the game we were promised but its an example of transcendant storytelling. Buy it. [/h1]",1607726597,1706220490,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

But since Phantom Liberty and 2.1, its been beyond amazing.
The gameplay feels modern and fresh without just increases to stats being your perks and new abilities changing the way you play (Jolt most notably (Yes I'm a tech weapon user)).
But above all else, the writers and composers did too well with Phantom Liberty. From a new ending to the base game, to 2 endings that are no endings. It induces the true feeling of an RPG in which your choices and their times matter. You can go down one path, then revert to another, but the end result is different than if you went down the singular path as it was, because the context and the meaning behind such a decision change.
Not to mention the absolutely beyond amazing music that goes on throughout the expansion, Gate K9, Never Looking Back, Test of Loyalty, and Phantom Liberty being the most notable. Gate K9 legitimately induced the feeling of how dire the situation of its context was.
And while it had its issues (The mandatory stealth section of the Cerberus most notably, along with how underpowered the Cyberdeck that is rewarded alongside it (BUT ONLY IF YOU FIND ITS BLUEPRINT, SO YEAH)) I still cannot recommend this game enough, but most notably the expansion. Phantom Liberty is now what I will consider to be my favorite expansion beyond even FFXIV's Shadowbringers.

However be warned that CD Project won't update this game anymore and no new DLC's are coming so i highly suggest if you wanna buy the game buy it during sale + with the DLC as it is really good to play.

Also Cyberpunk has had many scenarios what i would like to call ""lose lose"" situations during side missions, gigs etc and majority of them of course doesn't mess up the ending on what you wanna achieve in the game but just a heads up on those who are more ""emotionally involved"" with the story.

Overall the game looks fantastic and there is many crazy builds in the game and it's preference wise so whatever you wanna try i'm sure you'll have a lot of fun experimenting on it!

I love everything here except for the main story. For me this game is torture since I want to play it for everything else and when I have nothing else left aside from a main story quest it's like going to the dentist but it's actually worse than expected.

The game lets you create a cool character and the main story is you watching them slowly lose everything they have including their mind.

The expansion tries to fix this, but from what I've seen online it doesn't really help.

I still recommend it as the game is great and the above is my personal gripe.

Edit: After a new playthrough from the start and going through both the DLC and the base game there are a couple of endings I really enjoyed and I was really happy with the game when it always ended on a bitter note before. 

Honestly it still has some minor bugs, but it is one of the best games I've played and this has been my hobby for ~ 20 years.",1608466340,1706188858,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Good:
-Worldbuilding
-Characters
-Story
-Conflicts among characters (it makes sense why they're in the story, no magic ""I'm here for no reason"" types of characters in the plot and the progression)
-Weapons/Abilities/combat
-The hacking mechanics are honestly amazing, most games have a clear prefered playstyle with their mechanics, hacking honestly can be used just as much in a netrunner build as it can in a stealth build, and there's so many that it never feels boring
-The animations, models, voice acting, literally every single detail is amazing, and it all feeds into the amazing worldbuilding and immersion, you will feel like you are right in the streets of night city the entire time
-While I only did one ending on one playthrough, it was honestly one of the greatest endings I've ever seen in any form of media, the conclusion of all the conflicts, the character growth and concluding, someone needs to give the writers a RAISE and the sloppiest of sloppy

The bad:
-If you're the type to do story missions back to back to back to back to back, like me; I personally think the story can feel a little 0-100 with the final ending quest, I didn't get what the big deal was, few bloody noses here, few coughups there, big whoop, then the ending hits the GAS

Great game, great story, this deserves it's spot as one of the all-time greats. People will be playing this and talking about the lore in 2 decades the same way they are with new vegas;

First and foremost, let's talk about the Metro. That's right, you can now ride the rails in style! Forget about traffic jams and road rage; hop on the Metro and zip across Night City like a true urbanite. It's not just a fast travel system, it's an experience – complete with views of the city that'll make your cybernetic eyes pop!

But hold on, there's more! Ever felt the need to spice up your rides? Say hello to Radioport – the feature that lets you blast your own tunes while cruising the streets. Whether you're into heavy metal or synthwave, your ride's now as unique as your playlist.

For the speed demons out there, Update 2.1 brings back the thrill of racing with repeatable car races. Challenge your skills and push your custom ride to the limits. Whether you're in it for the glory or just to feel the wind in your cybernetic hair, these races are sure to get your adrenaline pumping.

Now, for the romantics in Night City, get ready to swoon. Update 2.1 introduces dates with V's partner. Wine, dine, and spend some quality time with your significant other in the neon-soaked streets.

And the cherry on top? Cats, glorious cats! Yes, you can now have a feline friend to accompany you on your adventures (or just to hang out in your apartment). These purrfect companions are sure to bring a smile to your face, even on the toughest of days.

In conclusion, Cyberpunk 2077 Update 2.1 isn't just an update; it's a love letter to the fans. With usual bug fixes, gameplay improvements, and these fantastic new features, it's clear that CD Projekt Red has been listening to the community.

There's also a staggering amount of cut content and missing features, many of which were probably dropped due to crunch and the already unstable state of the game.

Like I said, very solid game now. Making this review because the option came up after my FIRST crash.  So yes, the game did finally die on me, but that's after 75 hours.  I'd say that's pretty typical, so not upset about.  But i'll take some time and mention some bugs I've come across in my 75 hours so far...

1. Came across two mission breaking bugs (Delamain car) where it would not continue conversation or drive, and a cyberpsycho that glitched into the floor after I ran it over with my car.  Couldn't end up looting so couldn't complete mission. A quick save-load fixed the issue for Del, a fast travel away and back fixed the latter.

2. A dozen or so typical ""bugs"" from NPCs.  Cops standing on motorcycles, civilians doing NPC bug stuff, nothing too severe.  Just kind of breaks any immersion. 

3. Finally, right before my game crashed, I wasn't able to spawn my car.  Any of my cars, for that matter. Only thing I did before that was annihilate the entire police force and those hardcore dudes at 5 stars, like 4 times in a row.  In addition, sometimes when you do that the cops stop showing up lol.  But yeah, after I got away my cars wouldn't spawn.  I saved and loaded and it crashed.

The game runs better now but not flawlessly. The gameplay is still pretty weak. The leveling/progression systems have somehow lost depth in the latest 2.0 update. You do not role play as a customized Cyberpunk from the year 2077. You are V who is a pre-generated character with a pre-determined story to follow which you can do little to change besides what side quests you choose to complete and which ending you pick. 

I've tried about a dozen times since first completing the game to go through it again and after bouncing off a half dozen times over a few years I'm doing a second playthrough now in 2023 to see the DLC and 2.0 rework. I think this is mainly because the gameplay isn't all that fun, and there aren't enough meaningful choices to make between playthroughs. 

TL;DR Watch Edgerunners. Also, maybe buy the game for like $40 on sale including the DLC. I hope we get another Witcher 3 and not another Cyberpunk 2077 from CDPR, BUT this game is now at least worth playing.",1695671164,1706154936,True,0,0,0.530164062976837158,0,True,False,False

Games 25 years ago are more responsive and intuitive then what is seen here. The only way I can describe it is as if your character is a moist noodle - not cooked but not raw - flopping around helplessly. This game falls flat on its face in every game-play system it has. Skill trees are a clusterfuck, confusing, controls half baked. Gun-play is awful; every animation was stiff as a board, weapon sounds were a joke too, bullet sponge moron enemies are standard. 

Story wise the game flops too. It has the beginnings of ideas but essentially does nothing with them. Anything that could be profound is ruined by the intense railroading of the story.

The setting is cool, but that's it. A puddle miles wide and centimetres deep. Huge missed potential which is what frustrates me most; if it was just all in all a bad game I wouldn't care but there clearly was something brewing here but someone just turned off the burner early and served it up... :/",1706154933,1706154933,False,2,0,0.50202101469039917,0,True,False,False

It's not just a game; it's an experience where the emotional stakes are high, and the connections you form resonate deeply. Characters like Jackie and Panam are just a few of the many souls you'll encounter, each with their own hopes, dreams, and struggles that draw you in and make the world feel alive.

As you navigate the game's complex narrative web, you'll find that each decision you make carries weight, shaping your path and the fates of those you meet. The bond with your companions grows with every mission, every shared victory, and every hard-fought battle. The emotional investment in these digital lives is profound, a sign of masterful storytelling that blurs the line between game and reality.

The journey through Night City is one of both breathtaking beauty and heart-wrenching loss. Characters enter your life, each leaving an indelible mark on your story. Encounters with characters like Jackie and Panam are designed to evoke strong emotions, their personal stories enriching the tapestry of your own. The game's ability to draw such visceral reactions is a rare achievement, turning simple gameplay into a deeply personal experience.

CD Projekt Red's commitment to perfecting Cyberpunk 2077 post-launch has paid off, creating an adventure that's as emotionally engaging as it is visually stunning. The game has become a canvas for players to paint their tales of loyalty, love, and loss, all while exploring the rich, cybernetic playground that is Night City. Cyberpunk 2077 has transcended its medium, offering not just a game, but a slice of another life, where every joy and sorrow feels as real as our own.

Cyberpunk 2077 is a must-have for every game collection. You will not be disappointed.

[*]The story is well-written and holds itself without any illogical mistakes, the plot places you as [b]V[/b] - who's plans didn't work out so well - but you met your friend that has high aspirations towards becoming someone important in the city's life, that's the moment when you are actually forming your legend in Night City and then you get into some biz about stealing something from someone big enough... blah-blah... I won't spoil any other info about the story because it plays the only real shining part in the game but trust me, [b]you'll find yourself both happy and depressed sinking into the life of V. All of the main story side quests and some of the random ones are very enjoyable to do too.[/b].

[*][b]The next one I'd like to mention is combat[/b] - it is really enjoyable and fun by the amount of ways you can eliminate your targets. The game allows you to go guns blazing with various range of loud guns such as [b]SMGs, Revolvers, ARs and Shotguns[/b] - shooting with each of them is really fun. You can also use [b]Pistols or Sniper Rifles with silencers[/b] to approach the target [b]stealth-like[/b]. Using [b]Hacks to stun, damage or kill your opponents[/b] is also good if you invest into right hacking skills. The [b]melee combat[/b] is something I tried the least just because I didn't like the idea of getting shot at but in some rare occasions it was nice to slice some enemies into pieces.

[*][b]The music in this game is full of bangers[/b] and I really enjoyed listening to game radio between doing the gigs on the map. The overall state of audio in this game is at the great level and music really fits in the right moments of the story.

[*]The thing that really disappointed me is the cyberware and its lack of playstyle changing. Except some of the arm and leg implants that can give you a new way to fight or move - [b]the rest only upgrades your certain stats[/b] or gives you some kind of slow-mo lasting two seconds after you get detected or use the dash button while aiming with the gun. Operational Systems seem like they change your playstyle between the 'Hack' and 'Berserk'. -  [b]Leg cyberwares[/b] allow you to choose between the charged and double jump - [b]Arm implants[/b] give you a choice between 4 very unique fighting tools like [b]Mantis Blades, Rocket Launcher or Gorilla Arms[/b]

[*]Driving really sucks in this game and all of you should know it, the car doesn't even feel right, [b]off-road cars are bouncing like a ball on every single inch of uneven terrain[/b] - the cars also accelerate wildly so you can't actually turn fast enough if you hold the gas button for more than two seconds.

[*][b]Crafting in this game really feels off[/b] as you receive much better loot from enemy's corpses and the price of upgrading your weapon to match your level is a lot bigger than just picking up another weapon matching your level or just waiting to get the max level and raising the rarity of your gun to legendary with a lot less effort and resources - also - some weapons scale weirdly and have a lot worse stats than their same level friends.

[*]I'm not the mission designer or someone who can make decisions here but instead of writing [b]hundreds of mini-stories[/b] for the fetch quests and '[i]kill all the gang members and pick some bag that contains info shard[/i]' around the map, making a bunch of additional side quests would make it a lot better.

[*]Now, the biggest sin of this game - [b]BUGS[/b]. There used to be many visual bugs that made you wonder [i][b]""How did QA allow this to go through""[/b][/i]. [b]In 2022 it is reduced a lot[/b] - but... it hurts to see some that are still existing. I'm not gonna act like it's the only open world game with bugs but some of them actually make NPCs cut some of their dialogues making it sound bad, the requested car can either slingshot the other car it got spawned into in the air or casually spawn floating in the air...[i] or maybe it's a feature? dunno.[/i]
[/list]

To sum up, [b]the game's amazing in the terms of storytelling and the characters are very memorable.[/b] Combat is fun - Driving isn't, Crafting's debatable, it still gave me enough fun to do 2 full playthroughs and it will probably take you ~80h to experience everything this game has to offer.

CD Projekt Red has truly outdone themselves with this ambitious title. The attention to detail is staggering, from the bustling streets filled with diverse characters to the neon-soaked skyline that captures the essence of a cyberpunk dystopia.

The narrative is gripping, weaving a complex web of intrigue and moral choices that kept me on the edge of my seat throughout my entire playthrough. The characters are well-developed, each with their own unique personalities and story arcs that add depth to the overall experience. Kudos to the writers for creating a world that feels alive and engaging.

Gameplay mechanics are smooth, offering a variety of ways to approach missions and challenges. Whether I wanted to go in guns blazing, take a stealthy approach, or hack my way through, the game accommodated my playstyle seamlessly. The freedom to shape my character's skills and abilities allowed for a truly personalized experience.

Visually, Cyberpunk 2077 is a stunning achievement. The graphics are top-notch, and the attention to detail in both the environment and character designs is unparalleled. Night City feels like a living, breathing entity with its vibrant districts, each telling its own story.

Despite the initial launch issues, the developers have shown commendable dedication to improving the game through updates and patches. The post-launch support has been impressive, addressing performance issues and adding new content to enhance the overall experience.

In conclusion, Cyberpunk 2077 is a must-play for anyone who enjoys immersive storytelling, breathtaking visuals, and open-world exploration.

Honestly, its mixed for me. I love this game, its the perfect cyberpunk fantasy for me, but its far from a perfect product. It shines mainly during the side quests, where you get a chance to roleplay to your hearts content (lots of conversations let you choose to sit down so you aren't awkwardly stood there a la fallout, this is the kinda depth you can expect) whilst following (varying degrees of) interesting stories. on top of this, the build variety in this game is fucking insane. You can be a gun-slinging hand cannon wielder, a soldier armed to the teeth and is a fucking tank on the battlefield, a silent hacker able to slip by enemies or take them out through vulnerabilities in their cybernetics, to saying fuck all of that, upgrade your arms to have the force of a semi truck per fist, give yourself the ability to slow down time and own the shit out of anyone you come across before they have the chance to react. (can you tell which build I picked?). besides this, Cyberpunk's number 1 pro for me is definitely Night City itself, constant winding Alleys, back streets, wide open plazas filled with Bladerunner-esque holographic ads and so many lights and sounds its rare you get to experience a quiet moment. The best thing about the city though is the content, it's sorta similar to Ubisoft games actually where there's so much shit to do, but whereas it feels like a checklist in Ubisoft games, here the small crimes and wall graffiti to scan serves to make Night City feel as alive as it should. 

Anyways, it's not all sunshine and rainbows, although the game has made a comeback rivalled only by No Man's Sky, it ain't quite there yet. The main story suffers majorly from pacing issues, particularly where a lot of the set up for your situation within night city and relationships with others are glossed over in a montage near the beginning of the game, this backfires especially when a major character's death has its impact completely spoilt because you're given an hour tops to grow to like them, on top of this the aforementioned pacing problems makes a 30 hours minimum experience feel 20 hours tops, this is not alleviated in the slightest when due to an event in the story the player is discouraged from engaging in any side content due to a forced arbitrary time limit, though there's a similar issue in The Witcher 3 and if you're coming from that you'll know what I mean. Besides the story, in terms of roleplaying, it's far better than it was, but character customisation isn't very good, it's simple (besides hair) and in terms of actual cosmetic cybernetics, there's some face shit and hand stuff from upgrades, but not much besides that so expect no silver hands ;). in terms of actual gameplay, Cyberpunk suffers from the typical Fallout/Shooter RPG problem of it just being boring, the build varieties makes it fun, but only because you can avoid the actual shooting, even then, melee combat suffers too, but with things like the Sandevistan you still get a fair amount of depth in managing cybernetic cool downs alongside health. Alongside these, many smaller things like driving being ass or the police not chasing you or the bugs (which there are far less of, but are still a possibility) do exist, but aren't something I care much about as the first two were never the game's focus and the last one is basically a non issue, just a minor inconvenience.

Overall, Cyberpunk 2077 is a solid RPG experience that at its best lets you run wild in the cyberpunk city of your dreams, mercenary-ing to your hearts content, but at its worst can feel poorly structured or too short, too broad in some places but too narrow in others, but with the DLC set to fix a lot of my issues, Cyberpunk 2077 is definitely shaping up to be a truly great RPG worth your time and your money.

This review will be edited after hitting platinum. 

Long story short, bethesda forced me to play this game. Having seen the reviews (also graphic performance) of Starfield, I decided to give Cyberpunk a spin. It has been sitting in my catalogue for sth around 1 year. It also was around the same time that I got my new PC with 7900xt (I know, I am not team ""better""). The game is quite immersive even on the graphics side. It is quite a standard for CDPR games' to be well written. However, here the team decided to take cyber-emo turn and deliver us with this dystopian vision of future. Not even mad. Nevertheless, I would highly appreciate any happy ending. There is none. I did not expect ""Deadpool"" video game type of badass ending of a guy flying away on an eagle while being fed grapes by some thicc gurls, but.... 
NVM I highly recommend this game as it is truly a landmark in PC gaming history.

The game was praised for its narrative, setting and graphics, but at the same time it was widely criticised for its numerous bugs, especially in the console versions, which suffered from performance issues. Sony even removed the game from the PlayStation Store from December 2020 to June 2021, while CD Projekt worked to fix the problems.
However, CD Projekt Red has not relented in the face of these challenges. The company released a number of patches and updates that improved the game's performance and stability. Among these patches were changes such as improvements to the police system, perk trees, and the introduction of new features such as the NCART metro, radio port, repeatable car races, romantic partner encounters and more.
Reviews of the game following these updates were positive. IGN praised the game for its beautiful city, huge selection and exciting missions. PCMag also praised the game for its satisfying storyline, absorbing world and excellent shooting and melee combat, despite numerous bugs.
All in all, Cyberpunk 2077 is a game that had a difficult start, but thanks to the hard work and determination of the developers, they managed to improve it and turn it into a product that is now well-reviewed and appreciated by players. This shows that even in the face of difficulties, hard work and determination can yield positive results.",1706105803,1706105803,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

When Johnny Silverhand attacked Arasaka, it was also shown how he was shot by Adam Smesher, but the next shot showed him sitting alive as a hostage in the corporation. Moreover, Smesher himself told David that he would have made a good construct. David's death during the shooting was not well shown. As for Rebecca, the story took place in 2076, thanks to technology, it would have been possible to repair her and in the first episodes of the second season Arasaka could have held her hostage, threatening her with death if David (as a test subject) refused to work for the corporation and wanted to go against them. Lucy may have gone to the moon, but after a while (after the events in the game) she returned and heard that David was alive. After that, she gathered a team and organized an attack on Arasaka! This is my version of the continuation of the story, as I think it would be a great idea to make a season 2 based on the fact that Cyberpunk: Edgerunners successfully gained attention and increased sales for the game.",1705941918,1706086345,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
