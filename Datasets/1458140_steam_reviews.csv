Вы конечно можете каждую локацию пылесосить начисто, но уже через 3-5 вылазок, у игрока скапливается такое большое количество этого мусора, что оно просто копится и не где не используется или используется в небольших количествах.

2. Выжывание- В игре его нет, это не сурвайвал, я за 40 часов умер два раза, первый раз из за бага, второй раз потому что заехал в тупик и то я туда заехал, чисто ради интереса, посмотреть что случится.
По факту: 
1. Игроку не надо следить за уровнем топлева, почти бесконечная колонка с бензоином стоит в хабе
   а. На любой локации во время вылазки находится безумное количество топливных баков, так что во время поездки проблем с топливом обычно не возинкает.
    b. Очень часто встречаются огромные бензовозы или ржавые остатки машин у которых в бензобаке чаще всего есть бензин.
Игроку не надо парится за состояние машины.
    с. Машина чинится за несколькими шлепками соплей в проблемное место, а сопли эти, имеют крайне дешовый рецепт крафта
(в начале игры пока химикатов мало проблема есть, но уже через часов 5, при тчательном лутинге на локации у игрока накопится столько этих химикатов, что девать будет некуда)
    d. Запасных деталей на почти любой локации обычно в достатке, если уж у игрока и сломалась дверь или прокололось колесо, везде есть куча машин у которых можно оторвать запасное колесо, дверь можно скрафтить за гроши, да и колесо тоже, и где-то не подалёку 100% стоит тачка с бронированными дверьми и панелями.
По поводу главного героя, у него есть ХП и он может умереть, но проблема, что-бы в игре умереть, вам придётся по стараться, спецом заходить в опасные анмалии или рисковать доставя важные ресурсы. 
Но именно ""рисковать"" чаще всего не приходится.
Хочется ещё отметить, что в игре есть механика ""зоны"" из всяких PUBG и им подобных, но опять таки, если игрок специально не будет в них ехать, или рисковать собирая ресурсы после начала сужения зоны, то он не разу может и не почувствовать на себе её действие.
Также, сужение зоны подаётся как что-то опастное и страшное, по факту, ХП игрок теряет не охотно, машина хоть и разваливается относительно быстро, но как таковой опастности для прохождения, эта зона не представляет. За 40 часов я не разу не сдох от этой зоны, хотя поняв её сомнительную опастность, часто в ней ездил.

4. Крафтинг\прокачка- Крафт в этой игре только в первые несколько часов выглядит большим и сложным, по факту, 60% всего что игрок будет открывать, полностью бесполезно и никогда не будет использоваться.
Хороший пример с топлиными баками, в игре есть целая ветка прокачки топливных баков, их можно повесить на боковые панели, на пасажирское сиденье и т.Д, но смысла в этом 0, так как топлива на ЛЮБОЙ локации во время вылазки, как я уже писал выше, до жопы!
В игре есть 3 ресурса за которые игрок открывает новые рецпты крафта и улучшения, так вот если первый ресурс в большинстве ствоём открывает ТОЛЬКО полезные предметы, то два других (мид гейм и лейт гейм) практически не открывают ничего уж очень полезного.
Игрок без особых проблем сможет пройти любое испытание которые на него скинет игра без использования рецептов открываемых за мид и лейт гейм ресурсы.
Пример: Вот есть в игре панели и двери защищающие от радиации, электирчества, взрывов\столкновений, но всё это крайне ситуативно и такой урон легко избегается. Игра не ставит игрока перед фактом:
""Тут машину без защиты от электричества разберут на детальки, готовься""
Игра лишь сообщает: ""На этой локации много электричества"" но если игрок хоть сколь нибудь играет акуратно, он сталкнётся с электрическим уроном... Ну... Несколько раз.
По этому игрок может открыть и скрафтить ту или иную панель, но нужно ли это игроку? Нет, игрок всегда может оторвать на локации бронированные детали кузова, а избежать урона от аномалий не самая сложная задача.
Хороший прмер ещё в прокачке топливной калонке и генератора энергии что стоят в гараже (в хабе\на базе)
Их можно прокачать до 2-го уровня как вы думаете что прокачка даёт? Вы будете на 0.5 секунды быстрее заправлять своё авто и вместо 2-х нажатий на рычаг зарядки акумулятора, вы будете нажимать его 1 раз.

5. Сюжет- Вот тут перемудрили, слушать сюжет, как слушать диалог 3-х дотеров, при этом вообще ничего не понимая в доте.
Разработчики по напридумывали терминов и абривиатур столько, что хер проссыш о чём они говорят, зачем они это говорят, почему они это говорят? Добавим сюда ещё кучу научных и научно фантастических терминов и приправим горсткой графомании.
Почти все диалоги в этой игре звучат как:
""Взяли мы значит СФа и ЦМ, ЦМ ушла на бот, я естественно на мид, вижу, Урас Рошу забрал на 3-й минуте и с дагером крипов на вражеском ботлейне бьёт..."" 
Вот, если вы не знаете о чём идёт речь, понять смысл написанного, не представляется возможным от слова совсем, так и с этой игрой.
Я вроде понял завязку, от части понял конец, и абсолютно не понял что происходило в середине, это просто ужас. А заходишь по читать про лор, записки там, касеты, описания аномалий, а там помимо всех этих терминов и абривиатур, ещё и рассказы каких то рандомов и все они звучат как какая-то шиза научная...

6. Аномалии- Они есть, они существуют, но в своём ваакуме, в 80% случаев, игрок их либо избегает, либо не обращает на них внимание. Количество их скудное, а польза или вред сомнительный. А в некоторых случаях, вы их вообще не встерите не разу.
Пример: Вот есть аномалия ""Засхлый шарик"" или ""Плевун"" и их цель, смысл, это просто красиво пердеть зелёной жижой, игроку не надо их как то собирать или использовать, игроку не надо с ними не как взаимодействовать даже, 1 раз просканировали и всё! И на протяжении всей игры, они просто существуют на карте, я их или объезжал, или гнал пролетал на больших скоростях. Уже через 2-3 встречи с этими аномалиями, я на них даже внимания не обращал и это касается 95% всех аномалий что встречаются в игре.
Они бесползены! Их не надо изучать, их не надо добывать, их не надо деактивировать, их надо ПРОСТО, ТУПО, ОБЪЕЗЖАТЬ!
И ладно бы эти аномалии представляли бы хоть какую либо угрозу для игрока, но они либо на пару секунд перехватывают управление, или начинают рандомно щёлкать электроникой в машине (включать радио, поворотники, сигналить) или наносят на столько незначительный урон машине, что в определённый момент начинают восприниматься как раздражитель. Просто бесят, не создают сложности, не вызывают проблем, а просто БЕСЯТ, что они есть, что их нет, разницы было бы не много, (исключения аномалии из конца игры) но это на столько поздно встречается и на столько мало, что не воспринимается.

7. Побочные вылазки- Карта большая, локаций много, и подразумивается что в перерывах от основного сюжета, игрок будет кататься туда, в надежде найти чутка лута.
Проблема в том что смысла туда ехать, нет! От слова совсем!
Поясню:
В игре нет не то что необходимости, нет даже нужды ехать в эти локации, потому что все важные и нужные ресурсы находятся на ограниченном количестве локаций, а весь мусор который вы можете достать в этих побочных локациях, вы в огромном количестве сможете достать и двигаясь по сюжету.
Вот на пример я в начале игры столкнулся с необходимостью добычи нестабильной энергии и не где, кроме как на сюжетных заданиях я их взять не мог, у меня была нужна собрать редкие ресурсы, но локации с этими ресурсами открываются только после прохождения сюжетных заданий.
И нет смысла или нужды ехать на побочные локации, искать новые локации, если я всегда могу без прблем съездить повторно в локации которые раньше были сюжетные, локации в которые я знаю, и от которых я знаю чего ожидать. И фактор интереса или исследования, тут не работает, потому что локации, координально друг от друга не отличаются. Если игрок едет в болото, на локацию болота, то это будет тоже самое болото, с теми же аномалиями, с теме же модельками, текстурами и атмосферой, что и другое болото, единственное что поменяется, это ландшафт...

Pros -

Its a UNIQUE new driving game where youre not just driving a rich person car on a track. This game is its own thing. What other game do you drive your station wagon through an anomalous alt-history apocalypse zone?

Atmosphere is heavy and unique

Dualsense controller support is some of the best Ive felt in any game period

Driving physics really make you feel like youre driving a clunky old station wagon

Plotting your course through the games levels requires some fun strategy

Most gameplay settings can be adjusted

Game is polished, I have yet to come across a bug that stops me from playing the game.



Cons - 

Big use of procgen and a lot of buildings repeat. Youre often getting in and out of your car constantly, which hurts the flow between the game's driving or scavenging sections. Maybe thats just me. Id rather explore one big detailed building than a bunch of copy paste ones.

Not being able to save in the middle of a run is brutal. Too brutal. Not even souls games do this, like, if you quit in elden ring and start it up again youll be exactly where you left off.

Progression can feel a bit clunky and aimless.

Pacific Drive feels like STALKER and Car Mechanic Simulator had a baby.  Just enough general upgrading and mechanic work on the car to feel rewarding, and a good amount of exploring in a ""Zone"" of strange anomolies to provide enjoyable exploration.

It's one of those games that straddles the line between simulation and adventure and decides to side more with the adventure aspect, leading to the inclusion of the Simulator aspects to bolster the end result, rather than detract from it.

 with over 20 pride flags, not a single one is christian pride, white pride, or heterosexual pride, or does that not fit your inclusion agenda. talk about liberal pandering double standard, how about customization where you make your own? a lot of pros/cons are both bane/benefit for this game.

Pros: 

-good concept, unique car crafter survival with more than just normal car repairs.

-so far it seems dying is unlikely or very rare which is nice, e.x. radiation only took me to 10 hp and not lower.

-good amount of lore/information from extra sources found, upgrades, and scans, etc.

-takes maybe a few hours and a few core missions to get the jist of how things work for the most part.

Cons:

-huge emphasis on maintaining and survival, there isnt much thriving when it comes to rarer materials such as chemicals, as its used for repairs, which you need to do a lot, lot, lot of, so you can never really get much, every addition for better or worse means more repairs, e.x. extra storage.

-i seem to have to click a LOT more than needed for things to work, anywhere from 2-7 times because items/equipment/objects just wont use, and have to click again, and again, and again before they finally do, happens with using food, scrapper, anchors both picking up and putting in arc, this is just a few examples, becomes massively annoying, and its not a distance to item/object problem either, can be a foot from it.

-the only antagonist in nearly every regard is dealing with petty and frustrating annoyances, with a minor or two in resource management. which leads to some but not much variation in gameplay loop.

-gameplay loop gets stale by about 10 hours in, only variations in gameplay loop seem to be more fixing and problems with the car e.x. quirks. feels less of a survival craft and more of a sci-fi car repair simulator.

-anomalies can prevent interaction, e.x. sizzling mist wouldnt let me pick up an anchor until i was inside the mist literally directly on top of the anchor causing undue radiation/electricity damage, because, it only registered i was looking at the anomaly, and not the anchor.

-logbook explains lore of things but rarely how things are used or what exactly they do/how they work.

-minor bugs and issues here and there but not much affecting gameplay.

Conclusion: 

I wish i had more to say about the game but it really breaks down into a very simple idea and doesnt really expand much beyond surface level. a few things could use some work or expansion. and seems like the core of the game is maybe a couple dozen hours at best leaving you just personal milestones if youre really that interested. if youre not sure if you want to get this, for whatever reason, gameplay, price, redundant, etc, you should wait.",1708892459,1708917600,False,8,0,0.484424382448196411,0,True,False,False

I almost never write reviews on games, so please note that I feel strongly on this. With the state that the gaming industry is in and the burnout that a good number of people are feeling, it is no wonder that many are turning to Independent Developers for video games. That being said, although I was excited for this one, I did not like it, and I feel like I should tell you why anyone who has not tried it might not like it either. 

This game was shown off as a S.T.A.L.K.E.R. inspired car survival game, where you and your station-wagon would go through the pacific exclusion zone while trying to survive the many anomalies that inhabit it. The trailers sell the idea that you start out by scavenging resources in order to create better components for your car, which in turn allows you to go deeper into the zone. That is, in fact, true, and that is what the basic gameplay loop is like. However, problems arise from the way it's handled. This game is actually a single-player Extraction Shooter, but with a car instead of a gun. You start from your main base of operations, an Auto Shop. You then pick a Junction (in-game maps) to go and explore, and the Auto Shop's Map tells you that there are certain materials, resources, anomalies, weather patterns, and special traits that are located in said Junction. After your destination is selected, you cannot change it (there are upgrades later on in the game that allow you to select multiple destinations, but you start out only being able to pick *one*). You are told to then drive to the access checkpoint in order to leave the Auto Shop and head to the first stop on your trip.

Here is where my main complaint comes in: the fact the game world is fragmented. The idea is that the Zone's stability constantly shifts, which means that one minute it can be a quiet forest and the next minute an acid-spitting swamp. Don't get me wrong, that's an amazing concept, but the part that bothers me is the access checkpoints close after you pass through them. The exclusion zone is NOT a huge, open world you can explore however you want: Rather the game is split into small levels. When you are in a junction, you *cannot* go back the way you came. The only way to get back to the Auto Shop is to collect ""anchor energy"" to open a Gateway (a portal that takes you back). This means that collecting Anchor Energy is your most important goal, in a way: failing to do so under the time limit given to you is a game over, forcing you to re-do the Junction all over again. If you enter a gateway, you keep all of the gear you've collected (both on your person and in the car). This also goes for the Anchor Energy that you collect, which you can keep after a successful mission to craft and upgrade things. Hence: an extraction shooter.

I understand that having to drive all the way back to the Auto Shop every single time could be really boring to many people, but what bothers me so much is the fact that you can't do it at all. I'm not convinced that's a bad idea, there's ways to make the drive back interesting: a proper open world survival game you can explore and gather resources in can be fun, or maybe the gates could just be fast travel points. Maybe even allowing the player to do both, a quick getaway or a long drive.

For those who were looking for an open world survival game that had the best elements of games like S.T.A.L.K.E.R., The Long Drive, and The Long Dark, you should avoid this game. But for those who want a S.T.A.L.K.E.R. like Escape from Tarkov with a station-wagon then have fun.",1708912972,1708912972,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Original review below. The saving issue seems to MOSTLY be an issue at the beginning as you are unsure how things work. But once you play for a while it is still an issue, but more manageable. 

Still leaving it as a non-recommend for now. Still think there should be a save option for exiting the game so people don't have to commit to long periods of gaming and can have a life. 

Original Review:

Want to recommend this but I can't with the current saves functionality. Unless you are able to play non stop for at least an hour don't bother. 

Played for 29 minutes and had to leave for dinner. Came back and had to replay the same content again. 

Now that I know I need a checkpoint, I play again after dinner. Get to a check point but then about an hour into playing I need to go.....36 minutes since my last checkpoint. Only choice is leave the game running all night or replay that content again, This is not the game for me if you cannot log out and come back in where you were. I hope the devs reconsider. I would probably refund except I have slightly too much time, but I will hold on to it to see if the devs fix it.

Edit:

I'm further into the game and still am having an awesome time. I don't know what it is, but the intensity of each run with the cool anomalies and mechanics of the game are really fun. I like how customizable the car is and seeing how far you have come with each run and upgrading your vehicle from crude parts to very helpful ones just feels right.

1) The game doesn't allow saving while outside of a hub area. The explanation? Too difficult to add. Ha, ha, ha. That's literally the laziest excuse I've ever heard in this context. Except map randomization for (which you can easily store needed randomizer seeds) there's barely anything in the level which other games don't save all the time with little to no effort. And now you're telling me I have to sit down for hours until the game becomes a purely mechanical speedrun grind that doesn't include enjoying the atmosphere it creates? Seriously, most people have a life and a job and can consider themselves lucky to have an hour of continuous play. Meaning it's THE number of acccessibility feature outside of difficult to get anywhere with a title. Come on, this is 2024!

2) Most UI design is too inaccessible for a game where you spend so much time in it. I get that the stylization goes with this low-tech computer vibe that's everywhere but it's so hard to read _anything_ in its almost monochrome state. I'd rather prefer to see a plain, basic, non-pixelized version that does atleast have decent color coding and a visual concept for guiding the player's focus. Worst offender here is ARC's map screen where the legend covers half your in-game screen and has to slowly scroll to show all of its content. It took me literally an hour to understand scan & log because there's just so goddamn much going on the screen while the game adds yet another feature to the list.

That being said, the first point alone makes me cringe and I don't even know how to play this damn thing without dedicatedly planning a free day where I get a couple hours to do my first runs until I'm faster or loose interest. Second point doesn't help either - every time something new pops up you get less explanation about it and I'm spending more time scanning weird UI bits than actually interacting with the game world.

From what the developers communicated none of these points will change in the future, so I'm giving it a big thumbs down for deliberately messing up all the fantastic potential it has. Would honestly love to get a refund for it but it's yet another game that takes over an hour to get to full-on gameplay.",1708912809,1708912809,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The concept is great and unique: A rogue-like scavenging game where you try to keep your busted up car running while avoiding anomalous conditions that are a hazard to both you and your car. The visuals are pretty good, lot of atmosphere, even if the special effects have that slightly tacky unearthly glow to them. The main problem is that the scavenging aspect really isn't fun and the anomalies are more of just constant annoyances than threats. The extra-anomalous zones, random anomalous events, and the encroaching in-stability storms are neat, but the common anomalies don't feel dangerous.... just annoying. The scavenging aspect is fairly repetitive: Find car, check the trunk, hack the parts to pieces. Find a building, crack open any locked containers or doors, loot random junk. I realize that saying that a scavenging mechanic feeling like scrounging around for random garbage is an odd complaint at face value, but for a game mechanic, you don't actually want your scavanging mechanic to feel as boring as ACTUALLY scrounging around for random garbage. There just seems to be little reward for scavenging in terms of lore or material reward beyond maintaining your tools (which break ridiculously often if you use them on a regular basis) and obviously scrounging up enough for upgrades back at base. To put it more bluntly, the main mechanic of the game feels more like a chore than a game mechanic. To make matters worse, it only saves at the start of each area. To the game's credit, the areas are satisfyingly large.... which is unfortunately a problem because if you decide you want to take a break part-way through, you now have to redo that zone including the unintersting chore of hacking apart any random cars or buildings you find. I'm not entirely sure if loot changes when you restart a zone either, or if the general loot you find is so generic and unmemorable that it seems like it doesn't change, but in either scenario you end up feeling like you're just doing the exact same thing when you redo a zone. Having to redo a zone just to take a break is bad enough, but since it doesn't feel like anything has changed it's really just awful to come back to the game after deciding to stop in the middle of a zone. It's really a damn shame because there's so much I like about the game and WANT to like about the game, but I find myself unable to enjoy the game despite its great concepts and ideas. There's a lot of great unique aspects to this game, but it butchers the concept involved with rogue-likes where runs are bite-sized and addictive. I LOVE the fact that the random zones are so large.... but they're decidedly not bite-sized and taking a break in the middle of a run means you're not only going to have to redo a portion involving tedious amounts of scavenging, but you're going to do so on the exact same layout as you did the previous time, so not only do you have to redo tedious amounts of tedious work, you do that tedious amount of work with the worst sense of deja vu. It's hard enough doing so in a regular game, but it's almost obnoxious to be doing it in a rogue-like game.",1708908743,1708908743,False,0,0,0.39682537317276001,0,True,False,False

You prepare at base making sure your car is at its best shape, choose a route to follow, and loot buildings and vehicles along the way. You try to avoid anomalies that will try to break your car or kill you in different ways, from just pieces of the road and ground that rise as you are driving trying to make you crash, to floating scrap heaps that will attempt to kidnap your car or loot. 
Once you are at your destination you have to find ""anchors"", energy balls that will fuel a mechanism in your car that allow you to sumon an exit point back to the base, but at the same time make the Zone so mad at you it will summon an enclosing radiation storm to kill you as if it was a battle royale. So you gotta race to the exit before the storm rips you and your car to shreds. 
And it's at this point where the difference between having been taking care of your car along the way or not being prepared make all the difference. The last thing you want is to run out of fuel or battery while the clock is ticking, or to try and do so with flat tires, or getting caught in the storm missing a door.

Once you successfully get back home, you can use your newfound loot and anchor energy to unlock new car parts, or gadgets, or base upgrades, to make the next run a bit easier, or letting you drive into more dangerous regions without fearing your car will fall apart as soon as you drive over a puddle.

If you aren't a single parent who can only play games in 10 minute bursts and has to turn off their computer each time they have to step away instead of just pausing the game, you won't be running into saving issues mid-run. 
The game saves each time you enter a new route segment, if you rush the objectives you won't even take 20 minutes to go back to your base, or even less if you just aim for the next area.

TL;DR: drive, loot along the way, learn how to deal with the anomalies the Zone throws at you, summon the exit to go back to base, and drive back before the battle royale circle kills you. Improve your car and base, and do it all over again.",1708906008,1708906008,True,2,0,0.5625,0,True,False,False

Im starting to hear a voice on the radio that soothes me during tough times, it's a wierd radio station yet i cant help but think the radio host is talking about me.

She's told me she hates how I jam on the accelerator, I nearly pulled over but decided to go with it, She even tells me useful tips on where to go.

Ok now she's responding to my touch when i caress the steering wheel. I am convinced this is not a radio station. Its the car herself. Her Name is Meira.

The only times i reemember when to eat is when she reminds me of it. Meira knows my pain i go through. She also told me those ""tourists"" are trapped souls longing for purpose.

I dont care, I dont care i ever leave this place. I want to explore. I want to make her better, I don't care how far i starve myself I will MAKE HER BETTER!

She Weapt with me and bled with me, I felt the collisions, I felt the wear on her round feet, I even know that her steering wheel is off by .45 degrees. 

OH glory be my wonderful Meira take me to the promised land. take me To a place where people will understand me. We will tame broken bunnies, we will have a giant ranch dedicated to anomalies longing for purpose.

I have met others. Others like me, one who has lived in his van for 5 years in the zone, another a schoolbus turned into a small mansion, the ultimate nomads. Their wives they ride are so gorgeous, i feel we can make a difference.

I can see why my old man compared his women to cars. It was all right infront of me, The ulitity, the drama the nascar, the F1 series, it all stared me in the face and i didnt see it. for 20 years i didnt see it and i weapt that i wasted those years in ignorance.

If you make a wrong turn and force yourself into a dead-end, the game will auto-save, overwrite your manual save from back in the garage, and essentially force you to abandon the run, at which point your car will be damaged, important components will be destroyed entirely, and the materials you collected deleted.

This would not be so much of a slap in the face if the game auto-saved at every new zone you entered, but instead it not only disallows you from saving during an active run, but will also auto-save whenever your run becomes unrecoverable.

If you are so unfortunate as to be caught in a situation where you're unable to extract from a zone, but did not abandon before the storm closes in and literally disintegrates your car and kills you, you'll be sent back to the garage with a car that has no wheels, no panels, no doors, and anything that is still remaining is damaged to the point that you probably don't have enough materials to craft the unreasonably expensive repair putty.

Important vehicle upgrades are also completely vulnerable to being destroyed or even stolen off your car. Battery, fuel, and storage upgrades that serve as your only means of getting to the later-game areas can be stolen off of your vehicle my anomalies, or destroyed if your car is stranded in an anomalous zone.
So if you don't have a stockpile of extra materials to rebuild your car entirely from scratch, you're essentially starting from square one, with a car built out of silly putty, duct tape, and popsicle sticks.

The way the game handles savegames is beyond just anti-savescumming, it's actively anti-saving in general, the game will actively oppose any attempt to save yourself from a mistake, while having absolutely no issue with you losing an hour or  more of good progress even when you do everything right.
There is no technical issue behind saving during a run, the game will do it automatically with no issue, it is just designed in a way to never benefit you.

Despite all this, I like the game, it's atmospheric, it's engaging, it's tense at times, but with this saving system I just cannot recommend this to anyone looking for a casual story experience, if you don't like the brutal punishment for failure that certain extraction-looter-shooter games have, don't play this game, or at least don't ever make a mistake.",1708902471,1708902589,False,2,0,0.519230782985687256,0,True,False,False

For the aesthetic. 

Everything else is horribly lacking. The car, which is the main part of the game, feels like a babysitting job with the most annoying, fussy child on the planet. You can do everything right, and it's still going to break, almost seemingly for no reason. Even things like gas tanks are temperamental and will randomly spring leaks, so even things you should be able to depend on to get you out of a pinch are unreliable. 

Here's the gameplay loop: 

You drive off the road so you could avoid Tourists? Flat tire. 
So you fix the tire. 
Then an abductor drags you off the road and the same tire goes flat again. 
So you fix it again. 
Then your battery dies. 
Then a panel on the car becomes horribly damaged and breaks because of the corrosive rain. 
You finally gather enough energy to go back to the Auto Shop to repair, then as you're driving back to the portal, 2 tires go flat, you flip your car, and a steel panel breaks, all while a fast moving storm approaches and melts both your and the car's health some more. 
Now you're stuck, resetting the car, trying to fix all of these things while taking damage, then you die and go back to start it all over again. 
And it repeats itself like this for the 10 hours that I've played. 

Same thing goes for fixing quirks with the car. 
It's incredibly annoying to me, because I'll fix it, go on another run, and half-way through the run, the same exact problem I just fixed pops up again, but this time, it costs more resources to fix. Why? This is just stupid game design used to pad out the run time by forcing players to go out and gather more resources to fix a problem they've already fixed more than once. 

No matter how much of a stockpile of resources you have, it never feels like you'll ever get ahead. I can't tell you how many times I've run out of something that I need because I have to fix the car every 5 minutes. It makes me not want to go higher up on the upgrade trees to get the more expendable parts. Like, what's the point of unlocking new tires if they suddenly become much worse at something else? Why would I want tires that don't go flat, but suddenly the car sucks at driving off road? 

This game feels more like a simulator for when things go wrong every step of a journey rather than a survival game, which it is not. Don't let the tag fool you. This game has no survival mechanics. There are no hunger/thirst/etc bars for you to worry about, but with the amount of time you're going to be worrying about the car suddenly deciding to fail you at every turn (no pun intended), it almost makes sense, because adding any sense of a general survival game to this would probably make most people write it off as a frustrating mess.  It also isn't open world, which most people thought this game would be, myself included. It's more of an ""open area"" game where each area feels really similar/slightly rotated. 

The UI is horribly clunky and overloaded with information, some of which is useless to what's going on. There is also the issue of the UI helping you upgrade the car with certain parts, but other parts won't show you where to install them. For instance, you'd think that a jack that lets the car jump would be placed underneath/around the wheels, right? Wrong. It goes in the backseat. Why? I have no idea. It never gave any inclination to being an interior mod. Make it make sense.

The game also runs like garbage sometimes for no reason. You'll go to an area and it becomes very choppy and headache inducing, but when you went through an area that looked exactly like this an hour ago, it was fine and there were no issues. 

The 3 characters are horribly unrelatable and annoying. They're supposed to be these super genius types, but the argue like they're children and it's just a really big turn off. There's parts where I'll just completely mute the voice volume and listen to the music while I'm travelling, especially with one of the characters because she's just unnecessarily bitchy towards you for the better part of any interaction you have with her and it becomes so annoying to listen to her complain about every little thing. 

I'll also say it for people considering getting into this game: there are things called ""dead ends"" and you will die. You'd think with ability to create portals out of thin air, you'd be able to just, you know, make a portal to get out, but no, it's a death sentence that will result you car getting absolutely destroyed and you dying and losing everything that you've spent time gathering. It's a stupid gimmick that should be revised to where you can create a portal if you have enough energy to save yourself and an entire car full of goods. 

Overall, I think this game is very shoddy. It's not very satisfying and errs more on the frustrating side of things.  There's a lot of improvements that could have been made, especially to the car. Like, how are you going to make an entire game about driving a car, but the car is the worst part of the game? I think if they just ditched the forced narrative and let people have a survival game with these mechanics (after they polish them and fix all of the kinks) it would be fine, but I highly doubt we'll be seeing just a survival mode for this game.",1708894413,1708898204,False,7,0,0.575442254543304443,0,True,False,False

The Pacific Drive is a horror-themed rogue-like driving game that is centered around you going from point to point in a psudo-road trip to try to uncover more and more of the 'Zone' around the Olympic Peninsula and just what happened to make it what it is today.  To be honest, the devs made this into one of the most creative driving games I've played in a VERY long time!  What gets me about the reviews of this game is the save states.  They're that way on purpose, people.  If you know you're crunched for time, you can either do it quick, or don't do it at all.  Not the developer's fault if you don't know how to manage your time efficiently.  The game is designed like that for a reason.  I, personally, am a fan of it!  It gives an air of urgency to the trips and makes you have to balance rushing and going through it as a loot goblin (because let's face it, everyone and their grandmother wants that fuckin' kitchen sink).

Pacific Drive might just be the single best game I've played in over a year, the game world is intriguing, the story and characters, while a bit on the lean side, feel believable, and the car, oh my, a 1983 hunk of steel, large engine, low power, a roof that has a step in it?? yes please!

The Story, while i personally would have _loved_ more of it, moves you forward quite well, there are ups and downs but i never felt like i was just idling waiting for the next ""big thing"" to happen, and the ending left me with more questions than answers, but i didn't feel unsatisfied, it didn't feel like the writers blindfolded me just to end it for the next DLC to fill the gaps.

The ""worlds"" are mostly randomly generated but apart from a few issues here and there (lootables spawning inside vegetation and trees, being able to see through the floor in the entrance/exits of some tunnels) there are no major issues, maps mostly feel coherent, although the manually crafted ones are obviously a bit better.

The enemies that populate these worlds are another thing, they're scary, at first, but you quickly get used to their presence, [spoiler]and some may even be glad to see you[/spoiler].
There is a good variety of enemies, some big, some small, some about your height, most of them you don't want to mess with, some of them? well... just get close and find out, turns out, not everyone is against you.
 
And the car? Well, what can i say, its your car, you're gonna like it, whether you want to or not.
Based on an old Buick, this hunk of electrical problems is your reliable (although moody) friend throughout the game, it will always protect you, but it will not always act in your best interest, staying ontop of maintenance and keeping the car out of sticky situations will be your plan for most of the game, as it is american, expect problems, a fix is usually just a few steps away, just don't think you can fix these problems by just throwing parts at it.

To take a step back from praising the game, the performance is not.. great. my Ryzen 9 5900x and 3060Ti on Linux were struggling a bit, sitting somewhere between 50-70 frames, although this game doesn't need a high framerate, more frames are always appreciated, the short time i tried it on WIndows i had 10-20 fps more on average, not a massive dealbreaker.
Stability was top notch, zero crashes, the only real ""bug"" i found was that your garage behaved a bit... unexpectedly, when loading into the game the first time, walls would be missing or corrupted, some objects would only load when behind walls, things like that, leaving the garage and coming back resolved all issues.

And if its all just a bit too stressful? Don't worry, there are _loads_ of accessibility options, you can turn off and tune just about every mechanic the game has, less enemies, less fuel consumption, less repairs? it's all available, just a menu away.

Pacific Drive is an exceptional example in ""Indie Done Right"", the game developer focused on one thing and stuck to it, delivering a beautiful game with a great gameplay loop, in the sea of ""multiplayer open world mmo survival crafting early access"" games, Pacific Drive does none of these, fully offline singleplayer, no early access.

I'll be excited what the future holds for this game, and what the developer will do next, i genuinely hope they keep going exactly like they have done now, their direction is a good one, don't mess this up, pretty please?

It is not a ""calming"" roadtrip experience. Yet, driving along, listening to the radio, and scavenging parts is actually rather serene in a strange way to me.

Sometimes, everything works against you. Your car getting dragged off a cliff, into a rock or into other anomalies. Panels getting sheared off. Shield constantly being depleted.
But this world is not hunting you. You are as alien to it as it is to you. The various anomalies don't care about you, they just affect your vehicle and each other in their own reality defying ways.

It's not a horror game per se, but there are a lot of nerve-racking and panic-inducing moments, and even more relieved breaths when you finally hit the brake on your return to the garage. The horror aspect comes from times when you feel the world is working against you, which it really isn't. All the anomalies work in specific ways. Many are static and present an obstacle to brave or circumnavigate but they aren't actively seeking you.

When you return to a previously explored junction, it will have changed drastically. This variation and randomness work with the game's story, creating re-playable and interesting environments. You never know what to expect round the next corner, and the conditions mechanic can create anything from interesting or annoying to downright horrifying maps, and the panic and dread this causes is incredibly powerful. Up to four conditions can be present at a time.

An example of these could include [spoiler] constant battery drain / pitch-black map / hard-to-find anchors, making it integral to recharge your battery, pack extra headlights, or slowly and painfully traverse that area in the darkness, looking for what you need to escape. [/spoiler] 

I love the sense of humour in the game, most notably in its item descriptions, and the ways the anomalies are described once scanned makes it integral to either read between the lines, or find out what they do by directly interacting with them.

The car itself is so well designed, but that means it handles exactly like an old 70's/80's station wagon would. It's not always easy to drive, and requires a gentle touch often. But you go from a scrappy rust bucket whose door will implode if you sneeze on it, to something that will be your saving grace time and time again. You WILL find yourself dying or limping back to safety with no panels, shattered windows, and three wheels (one or more of which may be flat) but you will have the means to repair it, even if you just slap together a temporary panel or two or slap some putty on it.

My advice here? Take metal, glass, tape and plastic with you wherever you go. Remember, you can replace parts as well as repair them if there are no resources nearby. They'll keep you going and keep you safe.

The garage is a great safe house: it has a regenerating ruined car, computer and radio outside to scrap to get some basic materials, and a friendly dumpster that somehow always knows exactly what you need in any given time, and often kindly creates decor items for you as well. The garage is very functional and satisfying to use and upgrading your base of operations often vastly changes the gameplay experience; for example, the [spoiler] matter regenerator, which repairs anything you put in it while out exploring. [/spoiler] 

The quirks system effectively creates a parallel to owning an old crusty car in reality; weird squeaks, screeches, and noises, the car acting up with no real cause, or trying to diagnose a problem that you cannot for the life of you find. The diagnosing system is interesting (it takes the form of a 4-phrase puzzle), but there are SO many variables to select and given your 8 guesses to get it right, it is quite a difficult puzzle if you don't know EXACTLY what is causing the quirks. That said, upgrades to that system can help you along (if you have a little Anchor energy to spare, of course.) For a first time player I would recommend turning the infinite quirks guessing setting ON for a little while, to help you get to grips with the system.

Talking of settings - where should I start?
EVERY ASPECT of this game and how it works can be tweaked. Want a full repair when you return to the garage after a successful run? Want a streamer safe mode? Want dropped items to be even more apparent? There's a setting for almost every aspect of this game, and this makes it accessible to all players, no matter your skill level. I play it with most settings default, but I've played around with some of the settings before writing this review, and the forethought that has gone into the game and its options is unlike any other in my opinion.

The gameplay loop is quite simple, however, there are so many unforeseeable circumstances that force you to think on the fly, make emergency repairs, or use anomalies to your advantage. Most anomalies can be used to your advantage if the location and situation are right.

In a world where we're getting rushed, shoddy releases, this little survival game is a relieving, funny breath of fresh air, with so much to it that I won't list here. Go play it. That rusty old car is waiting for you to turn it into a fortress to tackle the Exclusion Zone with. 

But before I get back to installing more equipment on my souped up automobile, final thoughts.

It's a survival game like no other. I've seen it compared in many regards to Subnautica, and while I share many of those thoughts, I'd put this in a league of its own. It's an incredible, nerve racking, hilarious game that should be enjoyed however you see fit, and its exhaustive options menu can create an experience fit for anyone. Don't expect the game to hold your hand, but do read between the lines and listen to the three main characters (who are very well written, by the way) as they will give important information. When you first start playing, there's a lot to take in, but as time goes on and you complete the gameplay loop, everything becomes almost seamless in the way you interact with the garage and the world.

As this is a survival game, I kept looting everything and progressing carefully while I discovered the new threats encountered, but that takes time, which I do not want to have to redo just because I had to end my game session early.

This is a solo campaign, as such I do not understand that we can't at least save & quit when we need to. If they want commitment, they could possibly put a permadeath (permachoice?) kind of mechanism to protect against save scumming, which many games do in combination to save & exit (Don't Starve, Project Zomboid, The Long Dark, etc.), but not being able to stop playing without loosing everything when I need to is problematic. If the missions were shorter that would not be as much of an issue, but they take some time with decent maps that can require time to explore to find needed resources.

No save mid run makes things more frustrating.
Certain zones can be revisited on the map even though they are shown.
When you constantly have to drive fast to outrun the collapsing zone while  trying to use the map to see where you are going and yet crash the car also makes it frustrating.
The quickness of the timer in some zones also create undue frustration. 
Some things with some of the resources also are somewhat annoying.

Visually speaking the game has a nice style and some graphical flourish that fits well, though performance is a bit rough in places. 

Gameplay is fun and diverse enough to keep you on your toes and tackling new challenges throughout it's respectable run-time. 

Definitely recommend picking it up!

If I were to pick items to criticize, two things jumped out at me the most: 

The quirk/damage system could have used some more time in the oven, if only for a balancing pass. Certain component malfunctions and quirks develop with such frequency it rapidly becomes tiresome and breaks the flow of the game. 

In one instance a particular freshly crafted wheel broke down with a flat 6 times in a single run, making it feel like I was stopping for repairs longer than I was actually driving around. In a similar vein, I kept seeing the same quirk recurring that was triggering a run-ending drain of fuel or battery. When these happen, there is seemingly way to predict/prevent them, and when they strike it's often the end of a run.

In general, negative effects happen with such frequency i  became significantly disruptive to my enjoyment, to the point where I eventually switched them off entirely from the gameplay settings. I would've liked to engage with this system more, and reducing the frequency and severity of them would go a long way towards that. Perhaps giving quirks trade-offs and more potentially positive interactions would help as well?

My second criticism is the unlock system. Some items were very far down the unlock path of the game's ""tech tree"" that they were pretty pointless by the time I actually unlocked them. Some items could do with a shuffle/re-balance. Throughout my play-through, I kept thinking of ""nice to have"" that would be an interesting addition to this system, like a car module that used the existing teleport mechanic to hand you the right tool for the obstacle automatically, or let you send/retrieve items remotely at the cost of some battery charge (for example). It feels like there is more potential for the car component system than the game is currently utilizing.

Overall though, the above was not a huge deterrent to my enjoyment, and for the most part the game lets you tweak the gameplay settings to work around these issues.

First of all, I think the game is good, I like the concept of singleplayer loot/extract mechanic with your car that you can upgrade. I dont mind the randomized instances (raids) where you cant save, it gives you the ""fear"" of what things out there.

But the reason why I give this game negative review is politics. I unlocked a customization station and with it came a set of  flags stickers you can put on your car, but the problem is, ALL of the flags are woke flags, LGBT+ (And even every flag for every letter in LGBT+), BLM, Trans people, Asexual, Pansexual etc etc. Hell I dont even know what half of those flags mean. But there is not a single normal flag, for example some fun flags or country flag...no...only a bunch of woke flags.

A very special game, very stylized, atmospheric and well made I'd say. It's a very calming experience guided by amazing music and environment. 
The car drives nicely, the maintenance/upgrade mechanics are well-thought and not boring or feeling like a chore.
The Zone is beautiful and at the same time dangerous, gathering materials disturbs it and makes it unstable, spawning anomalies and could summon the Storm that will make you drive like hell to the exit.

For a game that isn't really billed as horror, 'Pacific Drive' does a better job of establishing a foreboding atmosphere and creating anxiety than most games in the horror genre -- and I've enjoyed every tense minute.

I feel Pacific Drive is a really nice concept and world which completely undercuts itself by using proc gen and instanced play sections. To set up a massive exclusion zone with many anomalies really implies a sense of SPACE- the game is car maintenance and resource gathering, sure, but really the game needs to convey that space. Because each ""level"" has procedurally generated loot, nothing feels meaningful or important. Once I found my nth ARPA bunker I just didn't feel like I was in a real space anymore, it just felt like a distribution algorithm run over a map. The game tries to lean into this by making the impermanence and shifting nature of the world part of the lore, but it honestly feels thin. 

Because everything is an instance, nothing feels connected in a meaningful way. It's like you just go through a portal in Crash Bandicoot into a single level and then pop out the other side. You can't ACTUALLY drive from one part of the map to another, the map doesn't exist! For a game ABOUT driving, losing out on the quintessential element of driving which is that it gets you from point A to point B is unforgivable to me. This is almost more like a mission-based mech game like the new Armoured Core than it is a driving game in any meaningful way.

The game is gorgeous, the art design is really fantastic. The UI is atrocious, there are honestly too many buttons and the menus don't hook together in a logical way. And it does that think there you need to hold down a button to cause an action to occur by default. The lore writing is all too verbose and purple prose-y, I honestly don't mind it when it's good, but all of this needed an edit to half the size (because it's not that good).

That's it, I really wanted to like this game and it has some neat ideas. I'm sure the instanced world is a time/energy/money constraint more than a really heartfelt design decision and I do respect that, but it does make the game not work, to me. The UI stuff is less understandable but is also more fixable in the long term. Kudos to the developers for giving this one a shot, it's a risky shot to take.

Performance:
I am running the game on RTX3070 mobile and is runs smoothly, though unfortunately not during the opening scene, which made quite a bad first impression. I have since encountered no performance issues during regular game play.

Difficulty:
I like the difficulty the way it is an I understand both why there is no safe feature during the missions and why people would like to have one. However the games difficulty setting are extremely granular, allowing the player to turn of almost all but the basic hazards.

Homophobia Jump Scare Warning:
If you are easily scared or enraged at the very idea of the (brace yourselves) gender pride movement, you should probably steer clear of this game or at least not build the detailing station. Or close your eyes when you do so and while using it. You get a lot (probably all) of the pride flags as stickers for free when you do so.

So maybe it was a bad idea to get this game in the first place. But I am a huge fan of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series and because pacific drive is offering a zone full of anomalies I thought I might give it a try.

So far I must say it is ..... pretty boring to be honest.

I wonder why they even bother to give me a car? There is an obstacle on the road every 10 metres. You have to stop every 20 metres to get out of the car to loot some junk. Up until now every location seems to be copy and paste with little variation. The scenery doesn't change much and there are no enemies in the zone just easy to avoid anomalies. It seems to be not my kind of game.

I do really like the visual style, the radio, the car and the setting. But I don't get the gameplay loop. I got a car - I want to drive. That means there needs to be some distance that I can cover. And I want some feeling of speed. Anyone old enough to remeber interstate '76? I hoped for something like that mixed with the zone from S.T.A.L.K.E.R. - that would have been awesome.

The main problem is that you have to re-play all the levels on the way to the new one you want to explore, every run, and can only explore one new level each run; so you spend most of your time boredly driving from one end of the map to the other, 5+ times through areas you've already visited, before you get to where you actually want to do some looting.  And next run, you'll have +1 level you have to drive boredly through
Even worse, there's only one path into the second zone (of three), so you're driving through those same zone 1 levels, over and over, with no choice about which ones to visit.  It has randomized events that might affect those levels each run, encouraging you to avoid ones with lots of problems, but there's no way to do that because there's only one path

It also lacks any skill component, with the main gameplay loop consisting of steering around obstacles.  Plus, many enemies just pop out of the ground randomly in front of you while you're driving, with no way to avoid running into their damage

And even the looting gameplay gets extremely stale, because all resources are abundant except Chemicals - the one resource that lets you repair your car - and those are only findable at one specific type of loot location, so you learn to ignore everything else.  They're also very rare, making it pretty much unsustainable, you're not likely to find more chemicals on a run than what you need to repair your car from unavoidable damage.  You generally rely on a dispenser at the base that gives you free materials, which restocks every run, making looting pretty much pointless




Other than all that, the story is really interesting, voice acting is great, it looks nice, the enemies and anomalies are cool, and it can get pretty intense when it's time to end a run.  It's definitely unique, but unfortunately it's just too tedious for me to recommend, and only gets worse the more you play",1708874103,1708874103,False,4,0,0.471935003995895386,0,True,False,False

And for the runs themselves, I didn't actually check if you can save there (probably not), but you can change in settings that the game pauses in menus, so you can easily leave for 20 minutes if you are a dad or something. The runs themselves can last between 15-30+ minutes which is entirely up to you as well, can't really blame the devs.

It's not about their choice of nerfing when you can save  - I haven't even got that far. Being unable to save after having reached the garage and done work on the car and all that is a humungous debbie downer nonsense that's killed motivation to continue. The game itself looks and feels like it would deliver on all the little things that will draw people to it. It's quirky in how it does it too. But I can't say this enough: Fix the save, don't have it not work or be finicky - there's no need for it.

I'm know I'm gonna get disagreed with on this, however, I've refunded for a very simple reason:

Save does not work.

I spent a reasonable amount of time finding my way round, got the car door fixed up and all that. Tried to find a specific way to save, and couldn't. I did apparently have a save, at the Auto Shop. But the game will NOT put me back there. It insists on starting from the beginning.

Sorry but no matter how good a game is meant to be, something that just will not save, isn't worth my time. It's not a quick shoot em up. It's a crafting/driving survival game - therefore losing progress for technical glitches kill all the buzz for me. 

Maybe I'll come back if they fix this type of nonsense. I do blame myself some - buying a game the moment it comes out isn't the world's cleverest plan.

As to the game itself: if save worked, I could have spent a few solid days of game time messing with the car, the weird quirky 80's themed UI and messed with all the fetch quests involved in upgrading the car. I love the idea of the car being the focus for your survival and will follow the game long term.

So to play this game I have to buy into these braindead ideologies? REALLY?

The worst part is that they make it appear somewhat late in the game, so I can't refund right now. This is utterly disrespectful towards players.

Additional reasons not to buy:

- Horrible performance. I play in a pretty high-end rig 7800X3D with RX 7900 XTX so it's not a problem. But I also have a Steam Deck and it stays in 20-30 fps with everything in the lowest settings where it looks like PS2 graphics. But even in Ultra in my high-end rig the visuals are mild to say the least, equivalent to e.g. The Long Dark which runs at 60fps on high details on my Deck.

- The default gameplay settings for the game are terrible, like the one that makes you lose most of your stuff when you die. I learnt the hard way to set it to ""don't lose anything"". The thing is: the events in the runs are unpredictable, and you can just die at any time.

Thus far the narrative has been enjoyable, and it's pretty clear that's the driving force for the game over the mechanics. Also totally fine, but I just want to have my cake and eat it too, Hades style, ya know? 

Also worth noting that as of time of review I have had to crank the graphics way, way down from what I would get out of other games just to keep it from crashing my graphics driver, hopefully updates will improve performance (but I can't really grade something on what it'll ""hopefully be"" in the future, either).

- The detailed, unique and expansive mechanics for upgrading your car and your base.
- Sometimes has a beautiful atmosphere while driving, like being in the cyclops in Subnautica.
- The feeling you get after arriving back to base after a successful loot run is very satisfying.

Cons:
- May be graphically demanding, needs an above average graphics card to run with ultra settings.
- Can become repetitive after doing many loop runs.

Summary:
Its like an extraction shooter but for singleplayer with cars and no weapons.

The gameplay loop is:
1. Drive car to selected POI and get loot.
2. ""Teleport"" back home without dying.
3. Upgrade Car
4. Upgrade base
5. Repeat from step 1.

Well unfortunately far from it, I played the demo when it came out and was amazed at how bad the game runs, I don't have the best gaming laptop but can run RDR2 at +90 fps which in turn tells me that the optimization in the game is absolutely non-existent. When I did further research, I discovered that not even on the PS5 where the hardware can be matched 1:1 and the best settings for this can be made as a game developer in 2024 in 30 FPS! That's bordering on scam, every PS5 game I've bought runs at 60 fps MINIMUM and in this age that should be the most normal thing in the world. 

When many made their displeasure known in the forum (whether on Steam or Reddit), the developers quickly rowed back, where at the beginning it was said: ""Of course there will be a performance mode for the PS5 at some point to: ""No, we have planned it exactly the same way for the PS5, 30fps and 4k"" as the voices of the buyers became louder, people were banned from the forums in rows because criticism could not be dealt with. 

Steam should not only have an ignore list for games but also for developers. How many promises were made and ultimately not kept shows once again the age of the games industry, only this time I'm surprised that it's not a triple A company but AA who are starting to do it now. What will we have next, indie developers who fake a trailer like Cyberpunk2077 or NomanSky and then go abroad with the Kickstarter money? 

The last thing I would like to say is, yes there are an insane amount of settings in the game such as making the night brighter, being invulnerable, not losing items (but only if you die!) what is missing is a save function while you are in a run. Sure you can pause the game and check a box in the settings but I don't want to leave my computer running for 10 hours just to pick up where I left off. I wouldn't have a problem with a run lasting 20-30 minutes at most, but some of the runs take hours, someone wrote that you automatically save at the junctions, why not establish a system where we clean one or two junctions and then come to the garage or place mini garages or parking lots somewhere where we can quickly drive to and save. 

Because I know that it is useless to write something in the Steam forum or on Reddit, because only the absolute elite fanboys live there, I would like to give every consumer who is considering buying this game the opportunity to read not only my but countless other reviews and decide for themselves whether it is worth the 20-30 dollars. 

The game has no replayability whatsoever and after 20 hours as a casual player you´re done. I don´t know If the devs will add more content but they focused on left-wing propaganda flags and stuff you can pimp your car with, in a  +6 years old fantasy video game, imagine your child playing this and gets brainwashed by this stuff, that should be banned from video games!

I think this game is actually pretty good with quality voice acting and a decent amount of high quality world building.

After about 3 hours into the game (which means it is no longer refundable) I unlocked the detailing station which is a machine that allows you to customise your car. After unlocking this station I was bombarded with 20+ notifications of LGBTQ/BLM flag stickers for the car that I unlocked right away, there were no other cosmetics unlocked and just the flags. I was immediately taken out of the games world that was being constructed because someone felt the need to inject current day issues into a game that has absolutely none of those themes as part of the story at any point. I would have avoided this game and all the fuss as I do not appreciate people using video games to push their personal ideologies on other people. So I went to the discussion board to see if anyone else had felt the same way and to see if the dev would be willing to add an option to toggle the flags on and off. NOT REMOVE THEM. Even though I do not like the flags I appreciate devs who are willing to at least meet their customers half way. Instead of making a comment on this I was immediately banned from the discussion board for ""Hateful conduct towards LGBTQ Communities"". At no point did I ever say anything that was either positive or negative about LGBTQ communities and stuck to what I believe which is social/political issues that are not part of the game and only exist to either virtue signal or push an ideology shouldn't be in the game and that I wanted to see if a toggle could be added for those who do not wish to see this kind of content in the game they paid for.

Engaging atmosphere, pleasing base game music, interesting premise and a rewarding gameplay loop.  It's an odd mixture of The Long Drive, Stalker, and I'd even toss out a little bit of Subnautica there.

Biggest suggestion would be to save on entering your garage and before exiting as when you get on the road, you cannot save.  If you are going to play, put time aside to do so.  I do feel that a lack of 'save and quit' on the road is a bit of a detriment-- especially for those of us who are older with more responsibilities that can draw us away from our computers relatively often.  However, when planned around, this isn't a big enough issue for me to NOT recommend the game itself.

Personal desire for this game would be a folder to let us drop our own music files into the game for use on the radio.  Muting the in game music and starting up Spotify/Youtube WORKS, but it kinda kills the immersion due to it not lowering during dialogue, when you move away from your car, etc.  I just want to drive to some trad 80s goth music in my game, that's all.

Edit:  After playing for a bit longer, I found out that the game DOES technically save while out on a drive.  When you pass through junctions, the game drops a save for you.  So as long as you're able to complete at least one leg of a multi-part journey you're going to have a save available for as soon as you enter into the next zone.  As such, the information above is slightly outdated.  You're not able to drop a save on a whim, but it's not nearly as bad as other reviews that suggests no saves what-so-ever during a multi-hour drive.  Still not as good as a save-and-quit for life's random spur of the moment situations, but MUCH better than what was originally thought with the current complaints/reviews.",1708695529,1708851316,True,63,3,0.814073562622070313,0,True,False,False

Unfortunately, I personally cannot recommend it because my 31 hour save was corrupted after a random crash.

I am very sad to write this review, as I have been looking forward to the release of this game since I first heard about it. I will start by stating that this negative recommendation is due to my own poor experience, and is more meant as a warning to players and message to the developers in hopes that they can fix some of the cons and technical issues I experienced in future updates. This is a full review of my time with the game, so if it sounds good to you and you aren't worried about the technical problems, then I hope you have a good time!

I have been looking for a game like for a while- ever since playing The Long Drive and Mon Bazou, I really wanted to see a more fleshed-out survival/driving game, and for the most part this is it!

Pros:

I really enjoy the randomly generated but logical-feeling maps-- I feel like a lot of games fail here with super repetitive layouts, but the maps in Pacific Drive feel fun and varied every time.

The driving system is fun and fairly detailed, with different types of tires and road surfaces affecting acceleration and grip.

There are a large range of interesting and useful gadgets to upgrade your car.

The car maintenance and upgrade system is approachable and not overly complicated/realistic.

The story is very compelling and the voice acting is great. 

Cons:

Not enough variety in the points of interest-- most buildings have similar or the same exteriors with only minor variation on the interiors. Off the top of my head, there were probably 12 different types with 3 or 4 interior variations of each.

It can get a bit boring since the progression is a bit slower than I would like, resulting in some hour-long drives where you just collect common resources while unlocking additional routes for later runs, which can feel like wasted time.

The gameplay loop is fairly passive, with the only real threats being semi-static anomalies and the battle-royale-style closing storm, which can make the game a bit boring a lot of the time.

I wish there were lot more songs or radio stations- while the ones included are very fitting and some are pretty good, when I consider the length of the game (seemingly around 50-70 hours at the pace I was going), they became tiresome pretty quickly. Many songs have very repetitive lyrics or hooks that make it so that you are sure to notice every time they repeat. On that note, the lack of instrumental-only music or talk radio channels is a huge missed opportunity. This problem is extra annoying because there are random radio transmissions that sometimes play between songs, which means you need to have the radio playing all the time if  you don't want to miss them.

Lack of replayability- maybe my thoughts on this would change if I could have finished the game, but as it stands, I currently have no desire to start a new save file and start grinding out hundreds of materials, several dozen upgrades, and hours of routes again. For a game that has a lot of random generation, the game is surprisingly linear.

Technical Issues:

After 31 hours of grinding about halfway through the game (upgrades and achievements-wise), my game randomly crashed in the garage. Upon restarting the game and loading back in, my save is no longer listed. I checked my local save folder and it is there, but the game just won't recognize it. I tried making a backup of the file, copying it into a different slot, disabling cloud saves, deleting the latest cloud save, and verifying game integrity, but nothing helped. 

Personal Preference: 

I really wish the game had combat and/or more directly threatening enemies of some kind. At very least, if there were more aggressive ways for the player to deal with anomalies, I think it would spice up the gameplay loop quite a lot- currently it is just running or driving past/around anomalies, stopping, collecting loot, and then driving again, which does get a bit boring. There is some minor interacting throwing flares or using defensive car options, but they are all reactionary and based around avoidance rather than confrontation.

I also wish the game was scary. Maybe this was just my misunderstanding, but for a game so reminiscent of Stalker, Metro, and Into the Radius, I was let down by the complete lack of horror. Since there are no directly aggressive enemies and the anomalies are all just piles of scrap, the mannequins have to do the majority of the heavy lifting here, and it just wasn't doing it for me, landing at ""unsettling"" at best. 

Final Thoughts:

Considering the linearity and repetitive nature of the game, I don't think I'll be up for another full run-through anytime soon, which is really a shame, since I expected to love this game and be replaying it for months to come. Buy at your own risk if it sounds good to you, but I would hold off for at least a couple of patches until the game is more stable.

The sense of aesthetic, wonder and horror is impeccable, and the games design style and language knows its strengths and continues to play off them hour after hour. 

This is a game where about 15% of your time will be at the garage/hub where you will be crafting upgrades, diagnosing ""quarks"" which come with owning the car (just like IRL equipment just sometimes does the same) iand the rest is spent out scavenging for resorces, avoiding anomalies, and locating gateways to get out before the storm consumes you and the world around it in a torrential of damaging anomalies, wind, rain, and devastation. The story appears in location specific dialogue, which can be accessed at any time so there is no need to rush things, and you can move through the work for the most part at your own pace.  Much of it is told in the ""bioshock way"" through main ""quests"" and audio logs, and while many games that try to do this often have them feeling dry, Pacific Drive's narrative and characters have such personality, as with the delivery of said lines is done as a work of art.

I really like a lot of the small things as well - like the music muffling when playing inside the car with the doors closed, and it becoming louder when you open a door. Or when you fill up a gas can on the ground with the fuel pump, and it puts the pump nozzle in the correct place (small things that matter)!

I get that some games dump you in the world and leave you to find things out, but this takes that to another level. You have complex systems that are never introduced or explained, even in passing. Quirk resolution, something you NEED to do, is never introduced or mentioned at all, and is so poorly implemented as to make it essentially impossible for a newcomer to know how it works. Also, the system is so open-ended as to become an actual game-ender. When your battery drains quickly, but you have no idea what might be causing it and with what looks to be hundreds of possible causes with no ability to find out what... that kind of ends things right there and then.

The voice acting is great, but far too sparse.

I may come back to this in 6 months when it's actually finished. It's not finished on launch, which is hugely disappointing. Lots of money spent on marketing and influencers, not so much on the game itself.

I want to add what it's like as a player 20 hours in. I'm desperately short of chemicals, a required ingredient that is only very rarely found in buildings, often within locked cages, but is extremely common in crafting recipes. So common, in fact, that basic items that are required for the game require 6 or more of them. Why is this a game mechanic choice? I don't know.

On a trip out to get said chemicals, I have to go through locations I've already visited as I can't fast travel to anything but my immediate closest locations and then run the unpleasant gauntlet of random things in the road to damage my car that can't be repaired due to a lack of chemicals, the very reason I'm out here. Now I arrive at the 3rd location, and then I get punished if I stand still. All of the eye candy is not for looking at, no, no, no. If you stand still for 10-15 seconds, something will explode or fly at you from the dark and then explode. If there were any way of defending myself, this would be OK, but there is not. There are just game-ending enemies placed on roads with no ability to get past either side and no way of defeating them. Also, waiting for more than 60 seconds for something to change will result in getting engulfed in 'the zone'.",1708760385,1708842830,False,5,0,0.505711793899536133,0,True,False,False

There are some things missing, including the ability to make a progress holder save if you want to take a break while on a run, but my only request from the developers right now, in my progress through the game, is: More.

Pacific Drive bucks a lot of survival game trends, and thrives on its tactility. Everything you do is represented physically. If you want to drive you car, you have to physically turn your view towards the stickshift and put it in drive. Fortunately, you don't have to fuss with a manual gearbox, but everything else is all done by hand. With a little high tech help, of course.

Having lived a significant portion of my early years in the pacific northwest, I can attest that this game's rendering of the Olympic Peninsula of Washington state is absolutely gorgeous and very spot on. The endless, misty pine forests are filled with mystery and strange sounds, to both give you the spooks... And remind you that you're not alone out here. The anomaly is always around you, Things are weird, and you're trying to make it through a hostile environment. Usually it hurts you, but sometimes, it helps you. It's a delightful exploration...

With one of the best companions in gaming. I love the car. There is always a sense of desire, to dive out into the world to toughen up your car and your gear. To stripsearch everything you come across to get you that much closer to your next upgrade, to decking out your special station wagon in the toughest, roughest, science-i...est... gear by far.

I'll start by saying the positives. The game looks amazing, the Simon Stalenhag inspiration is really good and the mood, audio design, car handling, everything is great. I love this and I want more of this. Everytime I stop and look at the game I'm amazed about how it looks and sounds, there's no denying.

Now onto the negatives, there's a reason why I am not recommending this right now.
The first is input buffer/non responsive... it's pretty bad, you can't act too fast because inputs don't buffer properly, so if you want to open the door of your car, interact once, and close the door, sometimes you're 
stuck there with the door open and nothing happening... Same thing with car interactables, like paint or sealant, you can't act too fast or you'll get stuck doing nothing. this is a must fix.

Second is on loot, some items are extremely hard to find, but necessary to have at the same time, the biggest of these is ""Chemicals"", which can only be found within a single piece of furniture inside a specific type of in game building that may not spawn in any maps on your route, there's also a chance that this furniture doesn't spawn, or if it spawns, it can have only from 0 to 2 chemicals, which makes getting this item one of the toughest in the game, even though it's one of the most basic items, necessary for fixing your car early on. Still on the same loot issue, I wanted a way to knowwhere I can get certain rarer late game resources, the maps keep fogging away where I could get stuff or not, not sure why.

Third is the same thing everyone is saying, the way the game loop works is kinda hard to nail how long will a run take, and runs can be pretty long if you get good loot/anomalies rng. Since they added a fast travel, maybe there could be a portal into the later areas so you can skip early ones if you want to, having to always drive from early to late areas all the time gets tiring, (kinda like spelunky level skips) and if you get some bad rng on anomalies your car can get pretty busted early on, which makes things a bit tougher on later areas... If you get to the point where your run is long, you can't save mid-run, which is REALLY bad if you have a life, and you like, wanna go for a run on lunch or something, you can't be sure if you'll have enough time, ever, on this game. That's probably a simpler fix, adding a save mid-run in between levels seems pretty plausible.

Fourth is probably one of the worst game design decisions I've ever seen.
More than once I was confused about how the map routing works (you have to pre-route where you're going, and maps are spawned as necessary). I ended up on a ""dead end"", and the only way to leave a dead end is to die and lose items. That's it, there's no other way, even though you've been doing the same thing where you teleport out of a map for 10, 12 hours in a row, whenever you end up in a dead end you can't leave that way, you can only die and lose items and car gear. I am baffled about how could this pass, I know that for sure my car can go back the same way it came, my car is pretty damn good after 19 hours and can handle a lot of stuff, it sure could go back  the same road, but too bad because that's not how the game works right now... Not sure whose idea it was, but it's pretty much the worst game design decision in here.
This does not communicate in the same way all other things in the game are communicated, there's absolutely no reason for the map to have randomly clickable levels, and others not, and sometimes you end up on a dead end, what the fuck is a dead end, why does it exist... Not many people are talking about this right now because they're not that late into the game to encounter this, but whenever people encounter this, they'll complain because there's no reason for this to exist. At all. On any roguelikes ever created.
For me, personally, this shouldn't ever be even thought as a design idea for this game, or for any game. So... I'm not sure why this was implemented, and I'm not sure why it still exists in 1.0.

As I said, whenever they roll out bigger patches with more content and stuff, this game has a chance of becoming one of the greats, just not right now

The mechanics down to the controls serve to build the world and atmosphere instead of being generic or token aspects (as ""crafting and survival"" often can be). It may seem like a small thing to have to look around for instrument needles and the gear stick instead of just having a HUD or pressing a button, but it's perfect for immersion and pacing. The simplistic visuals help set the mood by not drawing attention to needless details but keeping it on the player's actions and how the world shifts around them from the terrain to lights and weather. Because of the solid art style and level design, the world's objects appear as more than the sum of their parts (even aside from their paranormal and supernatural properties). The audio design is sublime, just the right mix of spooky and real, and the world still feels fresh after 12 hours.

For a mid-price game, the voice acting and direction are really good. This is where too many games fall short, even on a bigger budget, but this is top-notch. The writing has been competent and interesting, and I'm thrilled by the ultimate mystery. The world is quite entertaining if sometimes terrifying to be in and discover.

The influences are probably obvious, but the Ghostbusters/UFO/SCP/paranormal vibes are unmistakable. As is the inspiration taken from Simon Stålenhag.

It's one of those games that's confusing at first glance because it's hard to tell what kind of game it really is. In short, it's a story-driven (no pun intended) rogue-lite game. Your car is a mobile base, and your base is a safe-haven. It is not open-world. You plot a route and visit different 'levels' along that route. Each level is self-contained and always looks the same, but has randomly generated anomalies, loot, houses, etc.

This isn't an action heavy game, you spend a lot of time exploring and looting to upgrade your car. And a lot of [b][i]things[/i][/b] will get in your way. Whether they interfere with your travels or propel you forward (sometimes literally) will be up to your curiosity and bravery to interact with the world put on the plate before you.

If you want an intriguing story, with rogue-lite elements and a mixture of very relaxed and very overwhelming gameplay then I think you will enjoy Pacific Drive. It has a great balance of content from fixing quirks on your Car to driving through crazy storms and avoiding chaos. To a relaxed drive through the forest to collect chemicals you're forever lacking. It's well rounded and keeps you engaged at all times.

The UI is overwhelming and takes time to get used to. But after 2-4 hours of gameplay the UI bleeds away into the background and only enhances the experience beyond those hours. It matches the theme of the game. And enables the details in the game.

Pros:
* The game runs great for my old computer. (i5 9600k, 2070 Super, 32GB RAM).
* It looks great, using the stylised look that ages well and complements the setting of the game.
* There is fun gameplay in every aspect of the game. Driving, Looting, Repairing, Story, Fixing, Enemies.
* The story good so far, I'm not finished but I'd give it a 7.5/10 so far.
* The feel of the game is great, its relaxing when it needs to be and chaotic when I've had a long enough break. And you're rewarded for taking risks.

Cons:
* There are some tiny bugs, Video settings not saving, mouse sens acting weird.
* The UI is overwhelming and confusing in the beginning. The learning curve can be quite steep.

For a game that is supposed to be atmospheric, it was not at all what I was expecting.

I am honestly not too thrilled about the save system either, as I have little kids who sometimes require my attention at a moments notice.  Although I appreciate the desire to prevent save-scumming, It would be much nicer to at least have a way to save and exit the game as needed.

It blends a few genres in a completely unique way that comes together very nicely. 
- There's Roguelite elements in the continual progression, randomness, and high penalty for death.  
- There's Extraction game elements in that you enter a zone, loot around, and try to get out with more than what you spend to travel. The game does have a bit of a ""timer"" on the zones as the instability grows.
- There's My Summer Car-isms, in that you are putting together some ragtag vehicle to survive in the world.
- There's an interesting, but very confusing, SCP-like adventure meta store going on with a very atmospheric world and feeling throughout that sucks you in.  I wouldn't call it scary, but it can be unnerving and tense. There are no jumpscares that I have encountered.

However, be warned, as with any resource crafting gathering game, there will be a moment where you have to grind a particular material to progress, and that can be time consuming.

The game has probably the most comprehensive accessibility and difficult settings I've ever seen in a game, allowing you completely tune the game to handle how you want. Do you want a hardcore experience where there's no assists, lose everything on death, and micromanage your vehicle? Yep. Do you want a more simple experience where things are highlighted, the darkness is now bright, night is shorter, and a ton of QOL help? Yep.   Do you get motion sick, or have colourblindness? Yep.

I haven't really noticed the downsides of the save feature personally, but I can see the annoyance if you have a lot going on IRL thats out of your control.  Don't commit to a long run if you can't do a long run.   I hope this is changed in the future for the sake of ... everything, but personally, it hasn't impacted me at all.

ps. those complaining about stickers... yes, there's a whole array of pride flags unlocked by default. You can completely ignore them and you will find new stickers and cosmetics within your first 2-3 excursions.

Then started playing it and I found that as time went on I was getting more and more pissed off at it.  The game play loop is super repetitive and not very enjoyable.  Lots of design decisions are straight up aggravating.

For example, your tools each suck up about a significant chunk of your inventory.  Not so bad alone, but they each have the toughness of wet tissue paper and completely break requiring a replacement rather than a reload.  Why your whole grinder needs to be replaced rather than just a blade makes no sense.  It serves as a resource sink because many of the tools require some of the rarer resources to make.   So you rapidly reach the point of having 100+ of each of the common resources while constantly running out of the uncommon ones.  Don't even get me started on the actual rare ones.

The material transformers found in the wild are a great idea, except for one big problem.  Almost all of the ones you find convert some uncommon (or rarer) resource into a common one.  You will constantly find ones for converting the resources you are struggling to find into ones you don't even bother picking up because you have so much of.

The game is also a Rogue-like, despite never mentioning it to you anywhere.  Teleport into the ""dungeon"", speed run through to grab as much as you can before it implodes, then teleport back out to ""base"".  Each ""dungeon"" (except for a few specific missions) is randomly generated, with lots of modifiers you have no control over, and which you can not save while in.  Until you advance far enough you only get to pick one to go to, with no way to change or tweak it if it horrible.",1708823415,1708824091,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I haven't beaten the game so this review will need an update in the future. Overall the story, art, and ambiance are very well done. This game manages to scare me, not with jump scares or horribly loud noises, but with sheer atmosphere. Music selection on the radio is A+ and helps with the silent drives in an unknown yet familiar world. 

       Just like the other reviews i too would like a mid run save feature, as this game does demand some time for playing. Because some of the later missions rely on you to cross multiple zones to reach objectives, I could see runs getting into 3-4 hrs with only the ability to save before and after. Personally I have found many bugs with the in game settings menu, as sometimes it doesn't want to save my selected options.the only way i can play this game is with the GAME PAUSED IN MENUS toggle and it never saves my choice of on. I would like to see the more modern political stickers to be optional, as the 30+ stickers it gives you can sometimes clutter the customization area. maybe making it a free download, or a toggle in the menu.

    tldr:   Overall 8/10 , with future updates and an addition of mid run saves this game will be a whole lot less time intensive to play, and will finally hit the audience it was intended too. don't get it if you don't have the time to play it, early game runs are at least an hour or two long.

Timeless graphics, I REALLY like that. Simple enough that they will age well, composed well enough that the game still looks great. 

Runs really well: On a 6800XT with RSR and frame generation I'm running most everything maxed (except rearview mirror stuff that's on medium/high as default) and getting smooth and comfortable gameplay. Card runs hot but honestly any good looking new game makes my GPU sweat. 

Voice acting is good, and dialogue is a good balance of goofy and serious. 

Gameplay is good. Curious scavenging, heartpounding escapes, cosy drives, proper garage vibes while fixing up car. That you don't get to just save and reload at will makes for a pleasant sense of high stakes when you are about to do something stupid.

Story so far is good, and I enjoy that a lot of the fleshing out of the past is done in logs that you can choose to read or not.
I enjoy reading such logs in games, I know for some people they just want to experience the gameplay and you totally have that choice here.

I love this game, i've been following it a while and i've got very high opinions of it. The concept is pretty fresh, the gameplay is pretty good, the story is pretty cool, and the general atmosphere is sublime. There are some issues to be made aware of, first and foremost though.

2 big things
1: The save system is pretty screwy, it doesnt let you save until you pass a checkpoint, meaning that if you need to go, you either have to rush, pause and leave the game on, or lose progress. The devs are likely going to address this, since its the games flat tire holding it back.
2: I've seen a fair few people complaining about the game's performance, although for myself its been manageable (GTX 1660 Super). Certain areas, especially the garage as gameplay goes on, tend to be pretty laggy on higher graphics settings, and there are some oddities with said graphics as well. Unfortunately, the devs cant just use the tinker station to figure out why reloading a save can cause flashing and general worsened performance.

Aside from that, the games been great. There are many routes to the gameplay, ranging from focusing on the story, to upgrading the garage, to making your station wagon look incredible. The game itself is polished with a classic atmospheric finish, with a good soundtrack and some 25 songs on the radio to further immerse yourself in the experience. (there is no feeling quite like lumbering down the road, draining your battery for headlights because its nighttime and incredibly foggy, while the radio is playing Ghost on the Road. Bonus points if you turn on The Freeze while gunning it for the exit at stupidly high speeds.)

Overall, this game rides along at a plainly obvious 9/10. It's gassed up, and ready to go, with just a flat tire and a few little quirks holding it back.

But for me, it's the mood with pounding rain and wind, and going into a world that mixes Stranger Things and Simon Stålenhag-esque aesthetics. Oh, and the car-building mechanics and roguelike loop are fun.

You go to a zone (like you would go to a map in Escape from Tarkov for example), drive around, scrap cars, loot houses to improve yourself and your car. This is for every zone, so you can see where the repetitiveness comes from. I don't mind this, considering my brain is fucked, and I enjoy these types of games, but you might not like it.

The story is split into segments. You go to a zone, where you do some cool shit for the story, and then you have an intermission, where you have to reach the next zone to continue the story (you have to make a route between the zones).

The meh part is the performance. I think I have a pretty decent computer (3070 ti, Ryzen 7 7800X3D, 64GB of DDR5 ram) and the game runs at 60ish FPS on 1440p with frequent dips under 60. I think that a game looking like this (which is not an insult, it has some low poly textures, but the game overall looks gorgeous), should run better.

The BAD is the inability to save your progress while on a mission. Each mission takes a long time, sometimes over an hour, and I bet it will just keep getting longer, the further you progress into the game. I understand that it could be used for save scumming, but...it's a singleplayer game? You won't hurt anybody (other than yourself) by saving mid run and reloading if you die, so it doesn't really matter? Only people that are hurt by the absence of this feature are the people, that just don't have 1-2 hours to play in a row.

Overall, I do recommend the game in its current state for full price (even though it's discounted right now), considering it's only 30 euro full price. The story is engaging, the setting is interesting, and the gameplay is fun (if you like driving a car around).

To anyone concerned about the save issue, I have found a work around that is good enough for me.

All of these options can be found in Settings in ""Gameplay"" under ""Difficulty"".

First off, change ""Pause Game While in Menus"" to ""Always"". This allows you to take short breaks any time you need.

Now, if you need to walk away mid drive, change ""Failed Run Penalty"" to ""Keep Items"". This setting can be changed during a drive, so if you're like me, you can keep it on a more difficult setting unless you need to quit. 

This allows you to abandon the drive without penalties and damage. You keep all your items and can save back at the garage. Gathering resources is the time consuming part. If you have what you need, you can rush a drive and it takes much less time. 

For the record, 70% of my play time has been in a pause menu. However, I have found this game to be very fun & unique. I really enjoy the upgrade system, car quirks, crafting, and the intensity that comes when you're on a drive. I recommend it to everyone now that I have a better understanding of the settings. Quitting a drive midway is not a big deal when you keep all your items. 

I feel guilty, I never expected my review to blow up like this. I hope people that were influenced by it see this update. I wish the devs would have put this in a pinned post, I feel like it would have diffused a lot of complaints.

Original Review:

I played the demo & loved it. I can recommend if you have a lot of free time to play. However, for busy individuals or people that may have to get up and go at a moments notice, I'd save your money. 

The game only saves at ""checkpoints"". Which can be pretty far apart. Especially if you're like me & enjoy taking your time to explore. 

I was so excited to play this game. Yesterday was a longer day than I had hoped. Got home around 8pm and started the download. Usually I go to bed at 9pm, but I couldn't wait another day. 9:30, the download finally finishes. Rush thru the tutorial, as I've played it already in the demo, and get to the first drive. I'm so stoked. I take my time and gather every material I can find. Fix up my car. Explore a bit. Finally, the fatigue sets in and I can't keep my eyes open any longer. I open the menu to save & quit. No save button. I then just try to quit thinking maybe it'll save then. I'm then greeted with a warning that I'll lose 30 minutes of play time if I quit now. Begrudgingly, I keep going hoping I can finish. 5 minutes later I realize I don't want to rush the level just to save. Now I'm stuck. Do I leave my computer on for 20 hours so I can resume after work the next day? Can't do that. So I cry and say goodbye to 35 minutes of my life.

I HATE replaying things I've already done, especially when I've put time & energy into 100% as I go. If I do play again, rarely do I try to do it all over. This honestly makes me not want to play the game anymore. 

I just don't understand this decision. It's a big fail on the devs part. I hope they update it fast. For now, I'm very sad something I looked forward to this much just bummed me out. I may try again, but I'm leaning towards leaving it be for a week. If they fix this issue, I'll try it again. If not, I'll probably request a refund.

To any devs reading this, please keep busy individuals in mind. Some of us gamers only get 30 minutes to play here & there. Some people are on call or parents & have to drop a game in an instant. Please help us stay gamers by making saving easily available. I love games like Harvest Moon, Story of Seasons, and Stardew Valley. However, I never play them anymore because of the fact I have to play an entire day at a time. I'm sure there's many, many more people like me out there.

Edit: It's worth noting that whatever ""not being able to save"" issues people are having don't make very much sense to me having played as much as I have so far. Your entire shop fills up with plentiful resources so quickly that it is actually impossible to continue stockpiling, so stopping for almost anything other than specific rare resource nodes quickly becomes not worth your time.

Furthermore, obviously the point of the game is not to loot every single thing on the entire map, that is utter madness and there isn't even room in your car, you literally pick up so much loot so quickly you cannot even bring it with you. The main thing you want to collect is the energy orbs, which then cause the map to close, meaning you can't hang around on the map anyway.

- Drive your very slow car from place to place.
- Get out and pick up everything on the floor.
- Scrap the things you can't pick up and pick it up.

- Repeat.

There are some enemy NPC's but they're just annoying rather than scary or an actual threat.  There are also anomaly's dotted around but you can just drive around them or tank the damage.

The worse threat is the way your car handles and despite the upgrades this never changes.  The car drives it has glass tyres and it's honestly the least satisfying driving game I've played in terms of actually driving about which is a shame because that's all there really is to do.

The story is rubbish and the 3 characters who speak to you the most often are unrelatable and really annoying.  The main female character is literally unbearable and she's the one you have to listen to the most. I am totally not invested in it at all.

You are driving a beat up and (in the beginning) crummy station wagon, which you're driving through the Olympian Peninsula. The layout of the inventory system initially confused me, but after play for a few hours, it makes a lot of sense. You have to manually add small improvements to your station wagon (Change tires / refit the wagon with lead plates / or insulated plates for electrical resistance). You have to actually put the car into park otherwise it will actually start rolling. [There is a way to move past having to manually put the car into park ever time, but I will save that for you to figure out]

What I love about the game is upgrading the station wagon, since you feel accomplished in buffing it up. And there are noticeable differences as you play. Your car can also get little quirks that need to be diagnosed at a terminal by you before they can be fixed. An example is when I backed the car up, the hood of the car would open.

This game had a lot more dept than I initially assumed and I would recommend it. There is a bit of a grind for resources, but if you move past that, you'll really enjoy the game. I can only imagine what they could add in future updates, or what the game would be like as multiplayer. But if you want a good single player game, this is for you. And it's not $70!!

Regarding the prominent complaints about the game's save system: it's not that bad, and I wouldn't let the bad reviews on this subject stop you from experiencing this phenomenal game, or at least trying it out. The game has no manual save and only autosaves at the beginning/end of each mission and whenever you return to the garage (your base/hubworld). The top reviews would have you believe this forces you to regularly lose an hour's progress or something, but very rarely are missions in Pacific Drive any longer than 30 minutes, and basic excursions can be as short as 10 minutes. Not only do the game's mechanics push you out of missions and away from loitering behavior (e.g., limited fuel/battery and a battle royale-style encroaching storm create a sort of soft time-limit per mission), but it also gives you the option to rush out of the current mission quickly if so desired. The vast majority of missions you go on can either be simply be driven out of on the edge of the map (never more than a 2 minutes' drive away) or have an extraction sequence that teleports you back to the garage, which can also be rushed in just a few minutes. Only a handful of the longer story missions may not have an extract option on standby, and even these still fit into a ~30 minute gameplay block. And of course, the game does, in fact, have a pause button if you only need to get up for a short while. It would certainly be nice for some people to have an on-the-fly save system, but what has been done here is far from game-ruining, as some suggest. The concept of checkpoints is nothing new or uniquely restrictive--it's a basic mechanic found in all genres of singleplayer videogames since the inception of the medium and is often implemented by design. Coming off a recent replay of the original Resident Evil, it feels extremely goofy to hear people call this basic checkpoint system game-ruiningly restrictive, and I really hope those people don't discourage you from playing the game on that basis alone.

Other CONS:
-Performance ranges pretty wildly from solid to shit depending on where you are and what's going on around you, but especially when in the garage and on less-than-top-end hardware (I have a Ryzen 7 4800H, 1660ti, and 12GB RAM, and I am regularly customizing my car at 20-30 fps). Luckily (and ironically) the game tends to run much better when in the field driving around on missions where you want stable fps.
-EDIT: Turning Shadows down to medium from high fixed all of my performance problems, would recommend.
-If you're averse to the slow-burn resource collection of other survival games, then you'll probably find this game boring and grindy.
-Some minor recurring UI and visual bugs that may confuse or annoy you (dev seems to be addressing this though and already fixed many of these issues in the day 2 patch)

None of these issues, however, are enough to stop me from highly recommending this game to most people.",1708760785,1708808481,True,2,0,0.53271031379699707,0,True,False,False

The good news is that the game does now save at 'transition' points where you move to a new zone. This is acceptable, but I really wish it had a 'save anywhere' option. If it helps, this seems to be a common annoyance in several other non-AAA games I've played.

Also, what engine is this using? Because I have to crank the fans up on my card to make sure it doesn't run super hot, and it's still hitting 50-60C. If it's Unity, that's no surprise as Unity seems to do that with my card regularly (it's a Geforce RTX 4070, for the record).

Now that being said... it's pretty. Very pretty. I do enjoy collecting resources and crafting new stuff for my car. I think the tutorial could stand to nudge new players a bit as to how stuff gets done (by collecting Anchors, which let you unlock blueprints and upgrades).

Dev's showed off and explained what the game was, then released exactly what they promised.

Its immersive and often very intense, its addicting and immensely satisfying. Great clean visuals, excellent sound design, solid quick and smooth inventory management (after an hour or so of practice) and really I cant fault it. Beyond that its exactly what it says on the tin. 

Lots of people are complaining about the game not holding your hand, not letting you save scum etc. but personally I love it for all those reasons. 

For me the optimisation is excellent. 5+ year old mid range rig and I've run it at absolute max settings including DLSS on full quality for 6 hours or so. Had maybe 2 slight frame drops for around 1.5-2 seconds but otherwise flawless. No bugs to speak of and no gameplay crashes (unreal engine crashed once while loading from main menu, verified integrity of game files through steam and hasn't happened again since)

Its worth noting that in place of traditional 'Easy, Normal , Hard difficulty' Pacific drive has a wide range of fine tuning options to tailor the game how you want it. Easier gear shifting? No car damage? never run out of fuel? Lose no items on death? Lose everything on death? all that and much more are toggleable options that can be changed at any time.

Even after only 2 sessions I'm already bonding with my wagon big time. Repairs and part swap-outs are simultaneously quick and easy yet manual and satisfying. Finding paint, decals, dash ornaments etc. feels like a great break of pace from the usual mad scramble for essential crafting basics, and creates an endearing opportunity for you to  'thank/reward' your car for seeing you through another run. 

I could go on, but to summarise...

Pacific drive is more enjoyable, satisfying and immersive at £25 than most triple A games from the last 3 years have been at £50-70.
To that end despite a few very minor and subjective annoyances I dont feel are even worth mentioning, I'm already happy to give the game a solid 9/10 from me.

- Despite the name of the game, you'll spend very little time driving. You just fast travel to small ""zones"" where you'll spend more time walking than driving. Even when you are driving, it'll be for about 10-15 seconds at a time as you move from loot pile to loot pile.

- Very repetitive game-play loop within each zone. Same handful of prefabs used over and over again. The game loses all it's magic after the first zone you get through.

Pacific Drive is a fantastic game, the driving is simplified but enjoyable, the progression system feels like a twist on Subnautica, the atmosphere and world is incredible, the music is perfect, and the story is interesting. What more could you want?

I see comments defending the lack of save, they are welcome to be wrong. If I have this on a console I can save mid mission game design or not. Devs may as well recognize that and give the option.

I felt like after 2 hours, can't really remember how much I played exactly I have seen it all and I'm just chasing the next car panel and searching the generic house #239 for parts while listening to a toxic relationship couple I don't care go at each other in my comms.

Then again, the first 1 to 2 hours were so good, the intro is glorious, everything - up to this breaking point where I started seeing the repeated assets everywhere, where I knew every building was the same with no environmental storytelling before entering. I was not roleplaying a stalker survival with a car anymore, I was just going to each POI and collecting shinny stuff to upgrade what I needed and whatever. The sense of discovery was already fading.
This might have changed if I played longer - I doubted it would since it would had lost the ""new toy boost"" - but I didn't want to not be able to refund it.
I was hoping for a more Stalker Gamma/CDDA vibe with a focus on a car I guess. I also didn't found the game hard at all - but that is totally subjective also.

I would like to give props to the developers for answering questions and being active in the first few days of this game's release. They have issued 3 bug patches as of writing, and have acknowledged existing issues that they are working on fixes for. Thank you for keeping us updated!

The first glaring issues people have with this game is the [b]lack of an in-game save[/b] when you enter a zone. You can spend [b]hours[/b] making your way through a single zone or more, scrapping and crafting along the way. You can pause and leave the game running, but that is not an ideal solution. The other problem is [b]poor performance scaling[/b]. I have seen mine tick up to above 100fps at points where there is minimal visual activity, but most of the game will run at a cinematic 50fps or lower for most. I am using the default ultra settings on this game. I really hope performance optimizations will be on the radar. You can make an informed decision on whether or not to buy the game. There is so much to love about it, despite the problems.

The main gameplay loop is good. Each area you enter will have a changing landscape and random building and vehicle spawns. Avoiding anomalies and being a greedy loot goblin will give you a leg up in the long run; just don't try to push your luck when the storm starts closing in.

If they did have to exist why isn't there a the straight pride logo, or the the thin blue line or an American Flag?  Why just include things from one side if you have to have them in the game?

Anyway basically you drive around and see some weird stuff that sometimes tries to kill you, but all you can do in response is some fancy driving like Ryan Gosling in Drive.

This game seems to present itself as a ponderous open world narrative adventure or something, but it's really a very mechanical action-oriented roguelite with a lore-rich backstory that reminds me of an Arkane or Bioshock type of experience. The atmosphere feels a bit like Prey but with some 2008 indie rock-style tunes on the radio (you can turn them off). The solutions to problems tend to be spelled out so it's not really a puzzle game overall, but there will be some things you have to figure out for yourself, so probably you should enjoy having to trial-and-error your way to understanding certain things.

Very spooky, very weird, and always interesting to explore and see some new weird stuff going on. You will have a lot of procedurally generated mad dashes to the exit.

You have the option to select ""abandon trip"" from the pause menu while on a trip where saving is disabled, and manually save when back at the garage. Some may argue that you lose a lot of your progress/stuff this way, but you can find your stuff when you come back in the form of a ""remnant ghost."" This is a similar mechanic to retrieving items when dying in other survival games. You also have the option to edit the ""Failed run penalty"" in the difficulty settings, so that you retrieve all items from the ghost remnant when you have to return to the garage for some reason.

I feel like the developers might see the current saving mechanic as a feature, and I would be surprised if they actually patch this, as it might take away part of the ""challenge"". I guess a way to get around this is to tie an alternative save method to an easier difficulty mode or something like that.

Having said that, I must express that I am really enjoying this game! I don't play a lot of survival games, but this one caught my interest.

Firstly let's get to some of the things that are great in my opinion:
- The atmosphere and ambience is immersive.
- Working in the AutoShop and working on the car is fun. Customisation is great as well.
- If you like progression, and seeing it, then you'll like the AutoShop upgrades. It's nice seeing how it changes over time. A bit grindy, but not [i]too[/i] much.
- Music is good.

And for the things that annoy me a bit:
- Boy it gets repetitive fast. You come back, fix, upgrade, research and go back. Rinse and repeat. And what makes it even worse is building layouts are exactly the same, contain the same type of components you need. It annoyed me to the point where I'd just drive past because it feels like wasting time. If you've seen them once you've seen them all. I don't know if this changes later in the game, but I'm already in the Mid-Zone and I don't see any promises.
- The story. To be honest, I have no clue what's going on at times. I tend to miss some story bits as they are talking when I'm concentrating on dodging shit at 70 MPH. 
- When it's night, it sucks, especially in the AutoShop. I think I've seen you can change this in the settings. I don't mind driving at night, but I don't want to be walking around the shop with a flashlight to see shit. Just add a bed or piece of cardboard for me to sleep on to pass the time, please.

All in all, I think it's a unique game and it's fun. If you like seeing tangible changes as you progress, enough to look over some repetitive gameplay, you might enjoy this.

Driving around your vehicle, keeping it patched up, preparing for trips, even the heightened fidelity of something as simple as turning the key to the ignition and putting it in gear, it all feels relatable to a road trip but in the STALKER-ish ""zone"". 

Somehow the game feels sometimes like it tells you enough for the tutorial, walking you through the usual ""walk, crouch, kick, here's how you pick stuff up, put it on the car"" etc but the description of enemies, technologies and tools is often more in-universe bemusement than helpful tooltip, but this further drives you to explore, granted at a risk/cost even in something as basic as ""Do I craft this tool not knowing exactly what it does, with my limited resources?"" 

The world itself is stylized but beautiful, mysterious and eerie but not entirely alien.

You only get to save in your garage and not on the ""missions"", whre said missions can take hours if you dedicate yourself to exploring. Now imagine a situation where you have life outside of the game and have to leave. Not being able to save leaves you in a position of either:
1. Not playing the game like you want to (ergo, spend time exploring)
2. Quit and Lose progres, replay sections of the game
3. Rush to the mission exit (not always possible to do quickly) 

This is made worse by the fact that you can't (logically in a game like this) fast travel, making the loss of progres on quitting even worse.

I always hated singleplayer games that disrespect players time. There is 0 reason for this save system to be implemented this poorly. 

There is also the issue of the radio communications, being active way too often. I'm sorry, but just as I'm getting immeresed in the world, I get a lore dump nobody asked for over the radio? Why? Who thought that's a good idea? 

Overall, these are very poor decisions that drag the game down.

From the promotional material on the Steam page, I was imagining a procedurally generated open world and lots of driving, with the occasional stop to loot a point of interest.

Unfortunately, the maps do not seem randomised, although they are sometimes rotated, and while the exact loot found and the exact dangers present do vary from visit to visit - the fact that I say ""maps"" is another disappointment of mine. The game is open world in the sense that you can visit any of the dozens of unique locations any time you want, and they are connected on a road and highway grid in an even larger map that you traverse by selecting a location and fast travelling to it.

There's little reason to venture outside your car when things are going well, and when things are going poorly, there's every reason to simply get home and recover. Most resources are beyond abundant if you get out to loot every few hours of playtime, and the ones that aren't abundant then form a very narrow funnel for your activities that make it feel like you have much less freedom than intended.

A strong linear narrative pervades the entire game and provides a direction to follow. To me, this simply reduced my desire to explore outside the 'given' path, as it seems every location within the three 'zones' can have that zone's resources - so not going for the quest path is simply slowing your progress most of the time.

The dangers present in the game are not particularly grand, and unless your car itself develops an unfortunate quirk, there's not a lot to fear. In my playthrough, I almost died twice, once to a bug in the end sequence, and once because my car's quirk opened the driver's seat door and an anomaly nearly killed me during a forced-damage segment of the game. Most of the quirks developed are benign or unimportant, like making your window wipers move faster or slower, or turning on the cabin light, fiddling with your radio or dashboard, etc.

Finally, I was looking for a driving game with survival mechanics, but it seems I purchased another mid-budget linear narrative game with driving mechanics and a crafting system. The only 'survival' present is that you have a health bar, and that your car can be damaged to a point where you take damage instead. There is no need for food or water. The car has ample supplies of power and fuel so there's little risk of stranding yourself, and there is no way to save while outside your safehouse, so even if the game had larger locations and more driving segments to lean into driving and exploration more - you would be forced to do so in a single sitting, without the ability to save and come back after dinner.

TLDR; Wanted driving game, got narrative game. Emergent gameplay from survival and difficulty is lacklustre.",1708772841,1708772841,False,179,8,0.678923189640045166,0,True,False,False

I love this game
I love the driving
I love the in-depth healing mechanics
I like the characters and the story arcs they go through
The anomalies are so interesting
The inventory system was handled amazingly (albeit the items magnetize to the middle of the cursor so it makes it a slight annoyance to move something 1 slot)
The story was so interesting (I'm hoping that they release more story DLC or a sequel with a different setting but with Francis as a returning character)
I like the vehicle customisation but i don't know whether the resistance for parts like the anti corrosive panels or if it applies to the whole car
What does the LIM shield do? is it like the anti touch shield (emp emitter bumper) but you toggle it? I tried looking at the journal entry but i don't understand

Certain issues or possible improvements:
I never died. I just needed to be prepared. I'd always carry 4 large fuel with me and like 3 jumper cables. This and like 6 different sets of repair tools and replacement equipment and or panels, doors and tires :3
Chemicals do not spawn enough. I keep needing to repair on the field because i don't ever have chemicals to make repair putty
Sometimes i'd teleport to a high location if I was parking near a stability tower
Occasionally my steering would be prevented when something grabs the car and immediatley lets go
Having binds for the levers is nice but i feel like the parking brake needs it more than the wipers
Some quirks feel exactly the same like    Wipers - Toggle - Dashboard - Fuel gauge fails    and    Wipers - switch on - dashboard - Fuel gauge fails, That sort of thing.
I didn't really use the quirk fixer since I was always low on stable anchor energy and I can't be bothered trying to figure them out (good addition though but tedious to try find and fix)
I feel the car needs more personality, it does have quirks but i think that it needs to express things more like the panel on the left (i like when the car honks it's horn if i close the back door or when the radio turns on when activating a gateway)
Could use a tweak on certain materials since i found myself not being able to find specific things
I didn't even upgrade my engine once since finding parts for them was annoying and the default engine still works (also i didn't even know you could repair the engine)
The tutorial is a bit complex and confusing 
I don't know how the materializers? (you trade in one resource for another) work. I never used them because I put in items but it would just spit them back out.
The scanning system was nice but the info it provided needed some time to decipher, cool premise but sometimes was annoying.
I can't put side storage in the recycler
I never bothered to get part lockers because i can just store them in the floor or in the locker lockers
flares are good but i never bothered using a flare gun since i found flares everywhere
same with the bio flares

I want there to be 2 slots for bobbleheads and a way to make decals or visualise them so you don't waste resources when you experiment with style
I think having a dash ability you can put on your car like the jumper jacks will help when car goes airborne (like when shot up like the geyser anomalies). I don't know what to do but wait in those situations since my car loses any sort of control and i have no choice but to bounce
A good upgrade would be a mounted generator, consume fuel to make electricity 
A weight system would be good since i didn't really care what I was looting
Maybe make all items destructible or collectible. I hate looking at bottles in a shelf and not being able to pick it up even though the same chemical bottle is in this hazmat cabinet. even if the chemicals are used, isn't the bottle plastic or glass?
More transfer trunks please, i like manually placing storage areas around my garage
Can i feed the dumpster? maybe he'll give me better stuff if i treat him nicer
Being able to change the car type would be nice but i realise that might be an issue in relation to the story 
A proper roguelike mode kind of like inscryption's ""kaycee's mod"" for this game would be amazing
More offensive options like stun bombs or things to ward off enemies would further variate the types of playstyles in this game (like being able to explode the tourists or busses from a distance using an ability or tool)
More places to put abilities would be a good to have

And that was from just the demo. From its inclusion in last year's Next Fest as a sort of teaser, the game just sounded intriguing. And is it ever!

The game manages to do something novel with the survival genre, splitting exploration, zone runs, and vehicle maintenance into one compelling adventure.

The licensed music tracks are all fantastic and fit the game perfectly. Admittedly, the controls are a little wonky at first (it soon comes to make sense why they are the way they are IMO), but it's nothing one can't get used to. The menus are serviceable though not very attractive but overall fit with the game's design.  As someone with visual impairment, the HUD text could use some scaling but for me, it's a minor quibble. I really appreciate the various accessibility options too.

Performance on an i7 8700k and a 2060 is serviceable with everything set on medium or Ultra, with shadows on low and mirror reflections reduced. Framerate is consistently in the mid 40s to upper 60s. Though, I'm not much of a stickler for this aspect in a single player game, As long as it's not a stuttering slide show, I consider it playable. YMMV,

You don't have to walk back and forth gathering stuff from your storage lockers, and they even allow to auto craft pre-requisites materials without going to another crafting menu!

For those wondering, I've made a lot of progress through the story, getting upgraded and everything, with drives averaging 25 minutes. That means I'm 'saving' by returning to the garage about every 25 minutes. Since you can always go back out again, and since you unlock highway 'shortcuts' as you map out new paths, there really isn't any need to go for hours between saves.

So if you're the type of person who can only play in short bursts, try that out. Hit a location, hit the areas that have the supplies you need, then head home.

Even with the awkard bugs what is in at the headstart this game will be a cult classic.

It's atmosphere, the game mechanics are so uniqe even myself - who don't really like the typical survival genre type grinding - im totally enjoy this game. Every zone gives you random events and factors into your gameplay when you enter it. This makes the game highly replayeable and enjoyable.

I always liked games where i need to take care something about. Like Death Stranding (Sam and his Equipment or BB), Days Gone ( our motorcycle) and like in Mad Max (your Magnum Opus) you need to manage and upgrade your car here too to survive the zone anomalies.

The musics are phenomenal too! With the minimalistic art design It boost the whole game vibes even higher.

Extremely addicting survival driving/mechanic simulator with horror themes thrown in, drawing clear inspiration from the STALKER series for its setting despite taking place in America. This game is for those who like resource gathering and vehicle/base building management type games as well as atmospheric survival horror. It actually kind of reminded me a lot of this little indie game called Fear Equation, except instead of a car you are managing a train in that game.

People on the forums are idiots; I personally thought the game was not particularly difficult, and I never died once in my first playthrough which took 23 hours.

As you get better and upgrade you and your car failing runs happens less and less often, all in all the main parts of this game that make it so good are the scenery, seeing yourself and car progress, interacting with and surviving all the countless entities and anomalies you may find, and finally the customization of your once beaten and broken down car and the satisfaction of organization the lockers and storage systems bring. I never thought I'd have so much fun rotating items and fitting them just right in my bag for when those items mean life or death, and then tossing them in lockers when I just need to use them for crafting.

For the downsides, the seldom occurrence of a bug, being unable to keep all paint and decals after using them completely other than the deluxe dlc items, being unable to save while out in the zone, not having the electrical kit as a starter craftable (it can be pivotal in certain situations so I recommend getting it early game) and that's about it.

Keep a stack of 20 chems in your car at all times and don't be afraid to throw wounded panels and doors off. Definitely belongs in those narrative survival games such as The Long Dark. It is fast paced and requires good organization and preparation. I've heard it called exhausting, I can see the reasoning there. However, If you are the type who excels at navigating menus quickly, and enjoys preparation, and on the fly thinking in crisis scenarios. And the thought of kitting out your own ghostbusters/Stormrunner station-wagon excites you. I think you will like this game alot as I do.

It is a game that is difficult in its own way, with unique challenges that will take time to understand how to deal with effectively, and more importantly efficiently. Hell even the looting requires efficiency in some regard. Its exciting to feel like you are speed-running loot into your wagon, watching the storm, checking for loot spots. Identifying threats, all the while destabilizing the area as you go, outrunning an unending horrific, devouring force of nature. When you finally jump through the dimensional rift, and skid to your safehouse like Marty Mcfly, you see the horrific damages you have caused. The game grinds to a hault and you stop to think what you should have brought, where it should have been stored, what resources you need more of, If Wilson the wagon will forgive you, and what the hell is going on out there?

The concept is unique and designing the challenges and gameplay mechanics had to be difficult, but so far in the midgame, I believe they have hit a really nice enjoyable balance. There are also many settings you can change to mitigate some of the more tedious aspects.

Voice acting is great, and despite just being voices on the radio, the small cast feels like REAL people, not an NPC just there to spoon feed you info.

The game has a good amount of challenge to it, but that difficulty can be lowered in a customization menu that is very welcome for people who want to treat the game as more of a fun craft & drive game than a hardcore survival sim. I appreciate that, seeing as sometimes I just want to play a game like this without worrying if I'll lose everything when I die. The fact that the customizable difficulty allows this while still letting me retain some of the challenge (as opposed to games which opt for a full ""creative"" mode that I often see as limiting in-itself) is a big point in the ""pros"" category. The crafting system is enjoyable, not too clunky, and doesn't feel like a burden or an afterthought, so kudos to the devs on that.

On graphics: I really like the stylized look of the game. It's quirky in the way I would expect from such a zany game. It's not terribly well-optimized yet though (I have a 3080 TI and a 13th gen i9), and it sometimes chugs for a second in high particle load. Lowering the graphics a tad fixes this pretty quickly, but I can still hear my fans spinning a little, which wasn't a problem I had with Jedi: Survivor, which by all rights should be more intensive.

An open-world mode with the entire map available for exploring in a more free-form way would be a great future addition, as would a save function while on drives, but those aren't dealbreakers for me unlike some other reviewers. Overall, I hope this game goes the distance and adds more to it.

It's good, but I have some very minor gripes.

Performance is.. lacklustre for what it says is ""recommended graphics"", (for context I have a 3060 8GB Laptop GPU [whether or not this is bad , beats me] and an 11th gen I7-11800H, roughly at 2.3ghz, and 16gbs of ram on an SSD. )

Anything above medium, and I get pretty bad frames, not abysmal, but not good either, probably like 30 or something. 

Driving feels nice, and its a great feeling to see your car slowly become a bit more car like, and less rust bucket.

The story is interesting so far, my only real complaint is there's a lot of science mumbo jumbo jargon that hurts my smooth brain to think about, and the anomaly descriptions don't really tell you what they do, more so a very vague third person account of some guy talking about how his car got stuck up a tree somehow.

Visuals are nice for a sorta cel-shaded low poly art style, but it still takes a hell of a punt of the performance. 

Crafting isn't very difficult or really intuitive, you can make stuff if the back of your car, or just.. make it in your garage.

Pacific Drive is a great game, and pretty much what it says on the tin. Your car is like a mobile base that you drive around the zone, collecting scrap to fabricate upgrades and equipment, while dodging STALKER style anomalies. It's lots of fun so far and I'm excited to play more!

Everything works properly and performs well for me. I've encountered only one little UI bug that doesn't affect gameplay at all, that's it. Just the wrong prompt displaying at the wrong time. Pretty impressive for a game that's only hours old and hasn't received any patches yet these days.

Socialist ""Woke"" infused content DETECTED in Pacific Drive

I recommend marking this as helpful and marking Pacific Drive with the ""LGBTQ+ "" user defined tag so everyone can see what they are trying to hide, conveniently until just after the 2 hour return window.

""Hi,

I heard there is some political content in this game and there is the intention of making a political statement. Specifically BLM and LGBT content, is this true?

It may very well have been discussed elsewhere, apologise if it has.

But I'd like to know and let this post be a source of information for whoever else may be interested in whether or not this is a politics free title.

ANSWERED:

I was permanently banned by the developer of Pacific Drive, for this question in the community hub, the reason being ""hateful conduct"", I would say to that there is a difference between hate speech and speech you hate.

First off, I've yet to encounter a single hiccup playing. No crashes, bugs, glitches 10 hours in. That puts it above the last dozen releases that come to mind recently, and shows Ironwood Studios respects it's customers.

The first few hours ease you in well. Momentum is something all games need to really capture the attention of the player, and Pacific Drive blends that momentum with it's myriad of gameplay aspects beautifully. I never felt it dragging, instead seamlessly moving from learning controls to learning about the world to learning about your car to learning about the gameplay loop. It didn't feel like a tutorial, but it was a great tutorial.Your first time out and free to explore at your own pace was what really sold me. I've thought back to that 15 minutes often as I've played further because it was such a great springboard. 

In my mind I expect to point friends towards Pacific Drive as a standard for what atmosphere can do when executed well. Back at the garage, the player's safehouse of sorts, I've sat listening to music and finding excuses to stay and hear one more track. There are many activities to do, some routine and some when you want to get to it. Doing various tasks while listening to a banger of a soundtrack with rain pattering on the concrete outside is something. Meanwhile out in the many maps you'll go through there are peaceful moments - serene, sometimes almost whimsical - that twist into intense moments of fear, worry, or action where I'm invested at every moment of the journey.

So the introduction is great, the atmosphere is great, what about the gameplay? Yeah - it's great. The way Pacific Drive focuses around the car impresses me so much! It's safety in a tangible way, protecting you from an environment that feels alive. Storms push the car around, obstruct view, and feel consequential. They make you weigh the consequences of being in them and I AM HERE FOR IT. The gameplay loop itself is about going on longer-and-longer runs. The first runs are just one map, but later on you can go through a dozen or more maps in a single run. Each map can take 5 minutes or 30, depending on your goals. Through each map though, and through every area of those maps, your car is there as a dependable and perhaps calming entity. The game gives it a personality of its own and because all your crafting is centered around this single thing it is easy to get attached.

The principle 'enemy' in the game - anomalies - are expressive and had me rethinking what an enemy is. That first map I mentioned earlier had me creeping around, not sure what to expect and jumping at the truly excellent soundscape. What sounds like a mutant cow bellowing a valley over meanwhile a chunk of the ground decides it's time to express itself had me jumping. One enemy in particular, reminiscent of a popular Doctor Who entity, gave me absolute chills. That type of creature is easily one that scares me the most. But of all things, 10 hours in I'm now looking at them in a very new light. The anomalies aren't just out there to get you. They feel more like this world's creatures. And the way the devs have crafted them they have so much charm and personality. I love that my perception of a fear I've had for decades got challenged in a clever way.

Part of what helps anomalies feel so good is that your offense options are near nonexistent. There are handheld tools that can help against some anomalies and aspects of your car that can be modified to negate effects, yet most of your interactions with the world are observation and movement based. That may not be everyone's bag, but it also isn't just  running away from everything. You are encouraged (literally told in the tutorial) to really explore and I think they pay that off well.

Lastly, player agency feels very important here. I've yet to feel railroaded and was doomed to succeed or fail regardless of what I chose. There have been dozens of trade-off decisions I've had to make both in maps and in-between maps. The environment encourages you to keep your options open. For example tire types and whether you want to stick to roads or take the on the dirt and mud. I'd say the one challenge at launch is that you can only save in your safezone.

I'd sum Pacific Drive up as a breath of fresh air in a very stale genre of survival games. If you're on the fence, I encourage you to pick up Pacific Drive.",1708753811,1708754704,True,2,0,0.53947371244430542,0,True,False,False

This game has a few elements akin to roguelite risk-reward gameplay loops and, at the time of writing this review, can be incredibly punishing.

First, the one major complaint: when you pick a route to travel, you CANNOT save anywhere on the route until it's done. No checkpoints, no restarting the junction (""mission,"" basically), you get sent all the way back to the garage if you die or abandon, and when the later routes can potentially take up to 1 to 2 hours to complete, failing and getting sent back to the garage can sting quite a lot. On the one hand, I understand the intent behind this; save scumming is simply not possible here, you're forced to adapt to the situation in front of you; I respect that wholeheartedly and admittedly find that aspect pretty fun personally. On the other, I feel that this game unintentionally doesn't respect your time since you cannot save mid-run and pick it up later where you left off, which is definitely not for everyone. However, if this doesn't dissuade you, then read on.

Pacific Drive's gameplay loop is as follows: Go into a junction, look around for loot that you need and drive there, avoid dangers on the way there/when you get there, loot and scoot, leave the junction (all while keeping tabs on your car and making repairs along the way), rinse repeat. At the time of writing I don't believe junction terrain is randomly generated, but building spawns and resource locations are, and every locale you visit will lean towards a specific structure or resource to generate. Even when you get to later zones, you might find yourself returning to earlier zones to pick up resources that become sparse the further in the Olympic Exclusion Zone you go, if not for resource scarcity then most certainly for traversal safety, and by extension saving yourself time.

After every trip, you return to the garage safely with all of the loot that you find, and can then repair and improve your car. Preparation and thinking ahead is critical in this game, as poor planning can cause you to abandon or die on a route, causing a lot of damage to you, your car, and your inventory that was in your car and on your person.

Visually, this game is very pretty to look at, and while the setting is entirely in the Pacific Northwest, there's enough variance to keep things interesting. The further into the Olympic Exclusion Zone you go, the more eerie your surroundings become.

I haven't run into a single performance issue while playing this game; it runs like a dream, though admittedly not many things run poorly on my Nvidia RTX 4070Ti. The only ""performance"" problem I've seen (if you can even call it that) is when you sort a container with a lot of different materials or items. The game will take a second to think about the best way to sort your inventory/storage, but this happens during down time when you have the time to actually look at your inventory or storage, so it's a very minimal complaint.

Overall, Pacific Drive is a tougher game than I was originally expecting, but personally I find that aspect alluring. Highly recommend giving the demo a try first before taking the plunge.",1708740317,1708754190,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story is engaging and the voice acting is immaculate - AAA studios take note! I enjoy listening to the characters banter as they tell the story piece by piece. There's no repeating or anything annoying like that. The story is genuinely compelling, with a unique setting and a long history that the NPCs slowly unravel for you as your progress. The NPCs all feel like real, three dimensional people, with distinct personalities and motivations. There are only a few (at least so far), but they are all relatable.

The main game play loop consists of two phases: collecting resources in the world while trying to reach some goal in a limited amount of time, then repairing and upgrading everything in the safety of your shop. The shop phase is serene and satisfying. Repairing, replacing, and upgrading is all accompanied by graphics and sounds that pack a lot of punch. The world phase ebbs and flows between mysterious and haunting, cautiously dodging hazards, and full out racing for your life from some terrible monstrosity.

Some people have complained that the controls are finicky and the game play intentionally punishing and masochistic. I don't know where they are getting that from. There aren't that many controls. The ones that are there are thoughtfully placed to be easily accessible with left hand on keyboard, right hand on mouse. The keys used for actions aren't always the same, but there are only a few different ones and they all make sense as being for distinctly unique actions. Sure, there are a few places where you will make mistakes and hit the wrong thing while you're in a rush, but it perfectly mirrors the kind of mistakes you would make in the real world: bumping your head with the overhead door, forgetting to put the vehicle in park before you get out, forgetting to put it in drive as you try to peel away, not holding the ignition long enough to actually start it. I didn't do these things often and I quickly got used to them, but when I did forget for some reason, I blamed myself for being in too much of a rush, not the game for being unfair or finicky.

Perhaps most importantly: NO BUGS! Not a single one in 6 hours of play time, even in some sticky situations where the physics struggled a bit to deal with many objects colliding in a tight space. The game always figures it out and there are never any graphical glitches, clipping, lost items, being launched by the physics system, or anything of that type. I can't remember the last time I played an open world 3D game with physics that actually just worked.

My only real complaint is that sessions out in the world can be kind of long (1-2 hours) and you can't save during that time. I get why they did it - there's no way to save scum if you mess up, and failure has a serious penalty that encourages you to cut your losses rather than to push your luck. But I'm an adult with adult obligations - sometimes I have to get up and leave at a moment's notice. So far I've just left the game running while paused in the menu, but as my GPU continues to whirr and heat my office, I really would like to shut it down while I leave for the day or go to bed at night. Devs or modders, please find a way to enable saves mid-run, even just as an accessibility setting; I promise I won't ruin my own experience by save scumming.

All in all, I absolutely love this game. It really goes to show what a dedicated team of artists, designers, and developers can do when they have a passion for their work. It really puts the AAA studios to shame with their generic and repetitive game play, half-baked stories, and completely broken graphics and physics. It's just incredibly polished and enjoyable.",1708751172,1708751172,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

A few things: 

1. Please let us shut out the scary bad rain pellets by closing the garage door. (this is apparently highly requested)
2. The non save feature is there for a reason. If you can't make the drive, don't make the drive.
3. The music which we are all enjoying while dodging numerous road obstacles and road signs or splattering goo all over our car is made by REAL people. Real bands. If there's a song that particularly gets your attention, support them. Mine is ""Puzzle Pieces"" by LEMON BOY. They have 727 monthly listeners on Spotify. Let's change that. Not only should you appreciate the bands in the game, you should also appreciate the developers seeking out artists that deserve the attention rather than cheaply licensing what;'s popular or is a has been.

I adore the retro-Cascadia aesthetic, I am a sucker for the anomalous environments, and I love the idea being centered around the car. 

I only have two problems, it's a bit heavy on the generic survival gameplay traits (a slew of generic, base materials and a rather surface-deep crafting/research system) similar to Raft, and dislike the segmented route system. 

I only wish my drives into the foggy, warped peninsula were uninterrupted expanses of decay, where its me, the radio, and whatever the fuck is watching me from the mist on the other side of my four doors.

Requiring me to press and hold a button to open containers is probably my biggest complaint. It simply makes the game slower for no discernible reason. This is like baby's first video game type decision making from the developers. No one wants to wait to look in a container. No one wants exploration speed to be artificially hamstrung.

Three people yelling at me across the radio about things that have nothing to do with me does not a story make. Picking up audio recordings for exposition dumps is not fun. I thought we figured this out when Fallout 76 tried to get away with it. Opening my backpack to read about things I see in the game is not a good way to convey information to the player.

Inventory management (a huge part of the game) is tedious and boring.

Not being able to save in any meaningful places is also a bad choice. It's a big time sink to commit to a run and the runs get longer and longer the more you play, which compounds the problem further. Again I have to ask what the point of that decision is. It ends up feeling like an arbitrary restriction to make the game longer instead of improving the experience.

The game is way too dark. Turning up the brightness doesn't help in some places, and it blows out computer displays as a side effect.

Now for the elephant in the room, the politics. The game takes place in 1998. The modern political groups overwhelmingly featured in the detailing station did not exist in 1998. It makes zero sense at all that they're included and it breaks the immersion hard. The only purpose served is for the developers to virtue signal their preferred political leanings. This is made evident by only having one side of the leanings available, and that they're the ONLY detailing features available by default. This is not an exaggeration; you can spray Black Lives Matter and the LGBT+ Ally flag on your car before you can paint it red.

There is no indication on the store page that this game will be used as a platform to flout a political position. If it was made clear on the Store Page that modern politics would be included in a game set in 1998 for no reason, I wouldn't have purchased it. Instead, it's hidden behind a feature that can't be unlocked until AFTER I've played the 2 hours that would prevent a refund. It's comes off predatory.

I don't care what your political leanings are, or your sexual preferences are, or if you think men can be women or vice versa. That's why I don't want it crammed into a game where it makes no sense to have it included.",1708744025,1708744025,False,17,3,0.418189138174057007,0,True,False,False

This game is so much more than I originally imagined when they first started releasing drips of info on it. I was expecting something a little janky, a little underpolished, but with a fun concept. But not only is the concept a ton of fun, it's very polished. I'm only ten hours in but the content keeps coming and pulling me forward.

I could see the outings getting a little repetitive, depending on how things shake up deeper into the game, but so far most of my sessions have felt pretty exciting and dramatic in some fashion or another. Even if I'm just going out salvaging for parts in a place I've been before, things have a way of escalating in a big way. It often feels like you're on the edge of catastrophy, and the game is good at holding you there but giving you enough grip to hold on and tough it out.

Anyway, highly recommend.

Really fun gameplay loop, wonderful atmosphere, good music and an interesting zone to explore!
10 hours in and I barely saw them go by!

Performance can be a bit hit or miss but I found that by reducing shadows to medium my fps shot right up! 
Also I could see the save system being an issue as it seems to only save when you get back to your home base. Seeing as a longer 'run' can last 30 mins to an hour, if you can't commit the time or put your PC into sleep mode, you may lose your progress.
I assume this to avoid save scumming, maybe? But I do find it strange that you can't simply ""Save and Quit"" instead. 

All in all, a hearty recommend if you like 'being alone in a beautiful yet dangerous zone'.
I suppose if you like S.T.A.L.K.E.R, Death Stranding or Into the Radius, you will like this.
Although Pacific Drive has no guns/combat as far as I can tell.

Despite these issues, id still recommend the game except for one major issue i just encountered. when trying to figure out what i was supposed to do, i started a trip and realized it wasnt right immediately, well my previous save was automatically overwritten and i tried abandoning the trip, they say it will damage the car and i thought it wouldnt be so bad, got back and i had lost a door and single panel. not bad, i have a ton of stuff from my last trip ill just remake those. WELL  i was WRONG, it EMPTIED my cars storage of EVERY single item i have collected since i started playing. thats not punishing, thats game ruining punishment for the game not clearly explaining what i was supposed to be doing and me just wanting to figure it out with trial and error. i have to start over entirely now

gave it a couple more hours and it did end up being more forgiving than i had seen then. you can just got back to where you left and get a bunch of your stuff back. however you will have to recraft tools which is painful and unnecessary. also the shell of you car remains but you keep the car? i spawn on top of it and this created an issue that was very annoying and will have to be addressed by a fix i think. 

but the game is genuinely fun, it just needs a bunch of polish. if i were the devs id have said this is early access but at like 90-95% done, it feels pretty good and well thought out most of the time and i think i can recommend the game but players will just need some patience both with the game itself and the devs assuming they fix it.

Final note, this game is fun for sure but the random levels you end up can end up being impossible to succeed in forcing you to abandon and reattempt the ENTIRE run which can stretch for so far 5 locations. this CAN NOT be allowed to happen. it wastes the players time and you punish them for bad luck. this is game i want to have fun, let me have fun.",1708631271,1708738629,True,0,0,0.494587957859039307,0,True,False,False

Pros:
-Beautiful visual style
-Unusual setting (similar in some sense to Atomic Heart)
-Interesting lore
-Satisfying gameplay/visual progression
-Deeply immersive gameplay, one of the few games where I keep stopping just to take in my environment
-Lots of gameplay settings, you can play this as a grindy roguelite, or a smooth sailing story game
-Good voice acting
-Addictive gameplay loop

Cons:
-Bad optimisation, I most get 30-50fps on a pc that can handle most open world rpgs at the high/ultra settings
-Slow start, it took me 4 runs to get a good feel for the game, that was about 3-4 hours
-No mid-run save function, for seemingly no reason, you can only save at the garage
-Gameplay of looting CAN be tedious, but I've found that editing gameplay settings, to highlight objects more easily, to be a very simple fix. It's a shame looting isn't more engaging, but by making it more efficient, you can pay more attention to the good parts of this game, rather than trying to tell which items are lootable in a pitch black shack. Plus it reminds me of 2000s games like Bioshock, where all loot was extra shiny.

I'm disappointed by the optimisation & lack of save function mid-run, but what this game has to offer is wholly unique. Once in a while an Indie game comes along and tries a new unusual combo of gameplay mechanics, and on rare occasional it'll carve out it's own niche, I truly hope this game is successful enough to be one of those games. I just hope the devs lack of optimisation doesn't push too many would-be fans away

As with many of us time-poor gamers, I can play for 30min/1hr here and there during the week. This may not be enough time to get you from one save to the next, as you can seemingly only save when at the garage between missions.

Additionally, if you are 99% of they way though scavenging run and then die, you keep nothing...oh and now your car is totalled as well. So not only do you get nothing for the time you just invested, but you are actually worse off than you were before. C'mon man, even Dark Souls isn't *that* harsh.

These points aside, this game creates a really unique atmosphere. The scavenge/repair/improvement element is done really nicely here. This was an element I really enjoyed in Project Zomboid.

The voice acting is well done, and every little thing has extra details. You have to actually run up to weird and dangerous things and scan them to progress, which feels insane in a good way. Only taking risks will see you through.

I don't know why the headlights drain the battery though, it seems like the alternator just plain doesn't work, it doesn't recharge while the car is running. It does put a time limit on night missions, but it would be nice to be able to burn some gas to recharge the battery, maybe leave it running with accessories off or something. Quirky but acceptable, so long as you don't forget to turn the lights off, but especially early game with limited light sources leaving the car lights on is often the best way to not fumble around in the dark.",1708725720,1708725720,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game throws a lot of info in the first 15-20 minutes but it's ""non-gamer"" friendly, you don't feel rushed in anyway, dialogue doesn't push you to do things faster and usually everything you need to do is pointed out in some obvious sort of way.

A lengthy opening tutorial sequence with poor checkpointing (and which demands like 60 mins of your time uninterrupted, just syk) eventually opens up into a compelling lil looter-scooter where you swing between the twin compulsive processes of scavenging like cozy vermin and slapping your jalopy back into shape, all while making your way down the road in FTL-style branching routes, weighing diversions for resources against risk of anomalies, in service of vaguely narrative-oriented goals being Firewatched in to you via some sort of cranial radio that works in or out of the car (not complaining--I'd hate to be stuck in the car while they yap).

Vibes are great, too--the radio has some solid tracks, but the fact I most often prefer to leave it off and just absorb the environmental audio--of a night drive that periodically edges into danger--should tell you the compliment I mean to pay the devs in their own right.  When your car is being hassled by anomalies, with the steering going wild and the radio flanging in and out on various snatches of classic rock, it's a full-on thing to behold, right out of Close Encounters.

(This said--we should be able to listen to Art Bell-era Coast to Coast AM on this radio--anything less is a sin.  At least give us a custom radio station.)

Though, all things being equal, I *would* complain that the mouse + keyboard controls/shortcuts are somewhat counterintuitive and weird, and that, with all their long-presses and so forth, they feel like they were designed for gamepads and haptic feedback.  Don't get me wrong, I play with both, I get the virtues of either, especially for different games, and I can even see how stuff like turning the ignition would make sense with a long-press (and especially haptic feedback), but what I'm saying is: you use long-presses even when the prybar is making individual smash-smash-smashes against a stuck trunk, or etc--you use em too often.  I'm not against the long-press in principle (like some reviewers I've actually seen), but I mean, when you're using long-press on Tab to collapse objective goals, or long-press on C to toggle scanner details, it does seem gratuitous in a way that's just plain best explained by console/gamepad-centric control design.  It's not, like, an unforgivable sin, but since I'm giving feedback in early days when it might actually get seen, well, I'm saying.

And, fair warning: it's also not the biggest, broadest game--it is primarily a road, with the immediate surroundings, and its road segments are instanced, so anyone with ideas of this as a more traditional open world should swallow em immediately--it's a segmented world in which the finite area of each segment is randomized by ""the Zone""/procgen, and while I balked at that aspect somewhat before playing, now that I have, I'm really liking it this way, and actually think I prefer it to a more standard open world design, which would be easier to break re: resources.  I actually appreciate the way this design keeps a tighter hold on you.  

What I mean is, the instanced patches of road keep the random-item economy more balanced, and, somewhat paradoxically, permit the route to be more curated (by randomization that's adjusted to your particular standing each time it's rendered anew, on a new road).  The game's ""survival"" balance seems, at least apparently, easier to maintain when the world is not such a variable free-for-all.  You can pretty much always, at any time, go from having a stuffed inventory and feeling prepped for anything to rolling your car through a patch of bad luck and not even having enough chemicals left for sufficient repair putty, while being tracked by anomalies as you crab-squat through the tall grass toward your precious vehicular shelter, and it can happen in a frighteningly-quick string of events, which is kind of exactly what I want outta this kind of game... though YMMV.  If that's the balance they were shooting for, though--precarious, no matter how well-equipped--then they really nailed it.  And that's a hard one to nail.

Also, to be clear--you *can* change how the game saves in the options, but, speaking for myself, the default thing really still makes plenty of sense.  It's run-based.  ""Drive-based.""  It makes sense that, by default, you can save anytime in a safe zone, but not during a run.  I mean, that's what makes it a run.  Idk, this is just me talking.  I'd still say give it a try on the default setting before neutering yourself altogether, but again, YMMV.

All this said, I like this game a lot thus far.  It's a lot like if Overland was first-person, or if STALKER was crossbred with FTL... and Firewatch.  Which is all meant as praise.  In particular, the remote-NPC factor feels heavily like Firewatch to me, as does the indie-factor and the voice-actor-factor.  As with every experience I have, YMMV.

Heres 3 reasons why you should buy and also replay

1) The Story is well made and it has you coming back for more i can see myself and a lot of other players playing this game to be one with the road.

2) Gameplay  This has an unique style to driving whether it be dodging figures or parking to prevent being dragged by a abductor it always throws something at you so your forced to prepare

and for my final reason

3) Parts  The parts is if not one of the best things to come out of a game like this.

To the cry babies saying they can't save mid adventure... Yea, freaking duh you knob, go die. That's how looter extraction games work, its a feature not an oversight. You can't save mid raid in Tarkov, Warzone, Hunt: Showdown, ect.
It's a game genre, get over it and stop leaving bad reviews because you can't accept that fact.
The game already gives you a TON of options to make it un-challenging and an absolute cake walk, how many crutches do you need?!

Pacific Drive is an aesthetic game with brings some cool concepts to the survival genre, but falls short in some of the most important areas. The developers talked about how this game was ""being built for people who don't like survival games"" and yet it's core mechanics include some of my least favorite survival game tropes.

No matter how far I get, I'm always constantly needing to scavenge for a the same set of basic resources, with tools that break and then consume those resources to make more of... All while taking my car out to get those resources beats up the car and requires those resources to fix, all while it develops quirks or worse get's massive damage if I mess up, which... requires a bunch of those resources to fix... Oh, and sometimes it puts the exit gate for a collapsing zone in an area that just isn't going to be logically reachable in time for you, so you'll lose that hour or so of work you just put into the game.

My only real gripe is that external customizations (decals/paint) being consumable makes me want to be more precious with my car parts, but the key material for repair putty (chemicals) is less common than seemingly everything else, so it feels like the game is trying to normalize part churn at the cost of customizing the car's exterior.

Rogue-like? Check.

Battle-Royal circle shrinking? Check.

Looter to craft better gear for your car? Check.

The sound track is great and the atmosphere keeps you on the edge of your seat.  The anomalies and randomness is very interesting.

You're basically doing story missions and side missions to loot gear to upgrade your vehicle. Your vehicle is your progression.

Cons:

I had to do the tutorial mission 3 times because if you do not follow the instructions to the letter, you end up missing items you need to progress it.

Top problems:
- You cannot save unless you are no longer in a 'zone.' This means if you are out doing the thing trying to get through multiple zones and you have to quit that all of your progress for that run is gone unless you gate out. This would be fine if the game didn't require you to pass through multiple different 'zones' to get to the one you are trying to be in.
- Crashes are not constant but they happen enough to be annoying, especially with the save problem I already mentioned.
- The 'dangers' you face out while looting are basically just a nuisance after the first encounter. The tension goes from the unknown dangers you face in a zone to ""I hope I dont crash and lose my progress."" really quickly.
- The grind for parts is monotonous, but you have to do it constantly if you want to get anywhere. The game loop turns into 'Drive(warp) to location -  Loot everything - Go home - Purchase single thing - Repeat' 

I think most of these problems are just my expectations vs the games reality...aside from the crashes of course.

People with a lot of time on their hands who's gaming is scarcely interrupted. I do want to talk about the good, first, though, just so people know I'm not ripping into the game. I do recommend it.

 [h1] Gameplay [/h1] 

The driving feels rough, but responsive. It feels like you are driving a terrible old station wagon, which is exactly what you are doing in the game. Adding new pieces of armor, wheels, and engines to your car is also very fun and cathartic. Watching it go from a beat up old station wagon, to a beat up old station wagon with offroad tires, a new paintjob, and steel armor is really nice. It also makes the threat of losing all that much more scary.

 [h1] Story [/h1] 

The story is also great. It follows three scientists who are all still remaining in this anomaly-filled roadside-picnic esque 'zone' for their own reasons, trying to help you escape. I don't want to go too deep into it for spoiler reasons, but there are a lot of very exciting moments in the story. There are also a lot of interesting character moments, especially surrounding 'Oppy' or Ophilia Turner.

 [h1] Issues [/h1] 

With that all being said, as with a lot of other people in these reviews, I have to criticize the save system, as well as a lack of smaller more bite sized missions. If you don't have one or two hours of uninterrupted gaming time, the save system in this game can be a real pain in the ass. If you are deep in a mission, you have to abandon it to be able to save. The only other option is leaving the game paused until you can come back to it.

They also throw surprise extra legs in your journey at you sometimes, too, which exacerbates the problem even further. One time I was two junctions (what the map areas in the game are called) deep. Then suddenly ophelia goes ""okay, I'm adding this extra leg to your journey so you can stabilize the highway"". This last junction area ended up being the longest leg in the journey, with three objectives, and also a surprise destabilization of the entire zone with no warning. I can't imagine trying to do these missions and be thorough about looting when the save system is this antiquated. I'm pretty sure there is literally a better save system built into Unreal Engine 4, so I don't know why they couldn't have come up with something better than this. It really is the worst part of an otherwise very good game.

Also, I feel like you should be able to close the garage door while you are working on the car. It would give the game more 'cozy' vibes, and also, the storm is FUCKING LOUD. Jesus Christ, it's either dead silent, or like a category 5 hurricane. I don't want to listen to that the entire time I'm working on my car before a mission.",1708711846,1708711846,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game designers seem to be aware of the staggering number of issues inherent to the way they've made their jagged game design loop, because they have a magic dumpster that vomits stuff that you need in order to progress.

I don't fare well with durability mechanics. In my experience, they take away more from the game than they add, and this game is no exception. Repairing and managing the car, I understand, that's part of the draw of the game, but a crowbar? Really? What does a tin crowbar add to the game that a regular steel one wouldn't? Just let me play the game, please. I promise, I'll have plenty of fun without having to run to the trunk of the car every time I want to open a cabinet or deconstruct a computer. The tools are super cheap and materials are common, too, so it's not adding to the scarcity or forcing you to make tough decisions.

Light. Or lack thereof. There's an accessibility option to brighten up the nights indicating the devs know visibility is in fact a big issue in this game that they refuse to fix, so just turn it on and ditch the flares. They give you so many flares in the first few hours of the game, and the several seconds it takes to light up flares just drags the game's already slow pace down. I just run through pitch black rooms looking for Deus Ex: Human Revolution's piss cabinets anyways, it's not like I need the light.

Whose bright idea was it to spawn random electric fences mere feet in front of me when I have a car with no maneuverability or braking? If you just want to kill me, then just kill me, I'd have appreciated the honesty BEFORE the refund window expired. I'm of the firm belief that there's a difference between difficulty and unfairness and this game leans more towards the latter

The moment that prompted me to write this review is the part where you have to start all three link stations. By the time I reached the third station, my car was basically a wreck, my radiation protection is gone, and my gas is nearly empty because the devs DO NOT know how to handle the starting hours of a game. So, you'll be pleasantly surprised to learn that the game immediately spawns a destabilization event, tasking me to take my barely functioning vehicle through electric fences, those grabbers, and whatever nonsense they're intent on putting on the road. Naturally I don't make it, and then I'm not even afforded the courtesy of  rolling me back to a point where I had a functional car and a decent collection of supplies.

I GENUINELY want to like this game, and I want to try and beat it, but I just cannot recommend a game so shoddily designed from the outset. The demo actually did impress me, despite the durability system, but everything that happened after is such a poorly thought out dumpster fire that unless the remainder of the game is impeccable, (it's not, I've already seen the research tree), then this review is likely going to stay negative.

EDIT: Hey, I just dealt with the Quirk system for the first time. I see that the devs and I disagree on what words mean. Either that or it's just not working correctly. Bad sign that I can't tell the difference.",1708668221,1708705862,False,4,0,0.485849052667617798,0,True,False,False

I like that there's many customization options for what experience you want to have. you can change almost anything, from being able to die, to the whether the menu pauses the game or not. 

I have a laptop 3070, and the game always runs at ~40fps. turning DLSS on to highest performance only gives an extra 6 fps? turning settings down from max (default) didn't give ANY fps?? according to task manager, the game isn't maxing out my graphics card, nor my cpu, nor my ram.

It's a Roguelite. In it's simplest form. That's what it is, but there is a lot more to it. It has an overarching narrative. You choose places on the map (that are always randomized) and some of those places are narrative focused asking you to drive to a certain location or grab a certain thing. 

Here is what makes the gameplay very fun. It's a pseudo driving simulator/ exploration game. You have to turn the car key, put the car in drive, turn on the headlights, and the wipers which really add to the ambiance of the game, especially if you are in a rush to get out of a building and drive away in a hurry. Leaving the headlights on when you get out will drain battery. A very rudimentary driving simulator. You are also getting out of the car to explore shacks and houses and to scrap abandoned cars. All in an effort to collect resources which you then use to get upgrades at your garage. Things like sturdier doors, a bigger gas tank, more storage, and some more fun stuff like the ability to launch your car to jump over stuff. There is also some quality of life upgrades to get such as, automatically putting the car in park or turning the headlights off when you turn the car off. 

This game has a lot of customization options for difficulty and quality of life. One thing that really helped my enjoyment of it was making it so I didn't have to hold a button to turn the car on or shift gears, it is just a quick button press now. 

The game is overall very well thought out so far and has been an absolute blast. I really like being able to customize my experience to my liking.

+ I like the fact that if you spend too much time taking your time looting it can play against you (for genuine mistakes or game design/spoiler-free reasons)
+ Massive game progression features.

- Looting is not tedious, but can be repetitive (Use the T shortcut to take everything, and remaining stacks with space)
- The damaged features of your car will affect your driving so much you need to think of everything, including the kits to carry for your repairs
- The ratio time/exploration can be stressful in some levels
- The RNG before leaving an area can punish your whole run

+/- For the reasons above, Playing this game for several hours can be physically and mentally exhausting after 1 to 3 hours of playing. I haven't had this feeling since Fallout 4 in Survival mode. I don't know yet if I like this feeling or not.

The game  NAILS atmosphere, vibe and tone. The VA is pretty good, if not slightly grating, and some of the ambient radio chatter is incredible and very unnerving. Atmosphere is creepy but also cozy in the garage where you potter about fixing up your car and prepare for the journey ahead. There were some hair raising moments in the main world where I legitimately did not know if I would make it through but somehow I prevailed.

The one BIG blemish to the entire experience is absolutely the performance. And bafflingly, the major issues with performance all happen at the garage. I turned a lot of things down from the automatically detected Ultra to High and performance while driving about is a solid 60 with occasional dips and stutters as expected from an Unreal game. But the performance in the garage is simply pathetic and my PC (specs after this review) struggles to maintain a solid 40 even. While the game looks great, it's definitely due to the atmosphere and the aesthetics and not fidelity. I have played far more demanding, better looking games with ease so this is very disappointing to see in a static area which is supposed to be your resting stop.

I hope the devs manage to fix performance in upcoming updates. I will still recommend this game for how unique it is and how perfectly it has hit what it intends to do.

for the 3rd mission where you have to ""Link"" 3 sites, the objective term should DEFINITELY NOT BE NAMED LINK IF THE ESCAPE FUNCTIONALITY IS ALSO NAMED LINK. I saw 3 objective checkboxes to link 3 sites. I saw 3 Link keywords on my map. I linked one of them that I thought I was closest to. Turns out I was on the other side of the world because some random blue arrow lighting whatever was at the exact same spot of one of the entrances I thought I was in. Also it turns out Linking the Sites objective is not the same as Linking a Gateway. I accidentally initiated the escape process with no way to stop it or reach the escape because I was on the other side of the map. Goodbye to all my progress for the last hour (""boo hoo I'm a low attention span gamer"" I don't care, I have better things to do). Of all the possible ways to present the objectives and UI they chose ""Link"" TWICE. 

Otherwise, it definitely felt way too repetitive and dragged out IMO. The UI was diagetic but I would have preferred if the gameplay was even more diegetic. Make it a Strand-type game with more physics involved. Have more options with how to deal with threats and how to harvest materials rather than 1:1 tool => job. Make the descriptions for all the items actually give USEFUL INFO like where they can usually be found instead of endless vague flavor text (flavor text works for other cases to immerse the player, but it was literally thrown every where in the game it got old ultra fast IMO). Make the level design far smaller, denser, and more complicated so that emergent, dynamic situations happen a lot more rather than feeling like i'm playing on autopilot just for the vibes until something new comes up that still only requires one tool or approach and then that content is done. 

And also for the love of all that is holy can we come up with a new innovative idea for fail states for roguelike runs rather than ""You lose all the loot you gathered"". What if I kept all the loot but the environment permanently destabilizes and adds more negative modifiers in certain routes or everywhere? What if I kept all the loot but I get permanent injuries or debuffs or curses or other stuff? What if I kept all the loot but the recipes for some items get randomized? I don't want failure to disappear, I just want it to have actual consequences that leave permanent ugly marks on the world that I'll now have to deal with in interesting ways rather than erasing all the progress and any trace of evidence that I did ANYTHING WORTHWHILE with the hour I spent. Maybe I'm barking up the wrong genre. Maybe I just want this genre to be better.

After hearing about this game through PCGamer, and later trying the demo, I knew I was going to enjoy this one, so this review is going to be pretty biased. There's so much in here that I love, from the chill, atmospheric radio to the funky inventory management. I think it's incredibly clever and even amusing that various containers all have inventory shapes and sizes that closely resemble the shape of the object. Dressers have ""drawers"", lockers have ""shelves"", backpacks have ""pockets"", etc. Then having to cram as much salvaged materials, parts and tools playing inventory Tetris is just so satisfying!

The meat of the game, driving through the PNW, dodging anomalies (or intentionally driving at them), while vibing to the amazing music selection on the radio, looking for that next big score is all very well done. Especially as you start bonding with your beauty of a car. Just looking through the various tech-trees has me salivating over the possibilities of what my car is going to look like by the end of it! The not-quite-realistic-but-realistic-enough mechanic system really helps sell the experience. If you've ever worked on a project car and fell in love with it, this game does a great job emulating that experience. Just with more fancy sci-fi doodads and whatsits. Don't even get me started on the detailing!

Another aspect this game does really well is the full customization of difficulty options. It's not a simple easy/medium/nightmare choice, but instead granular control over various options to tailor the game to an experience you desire. It really impressive the control the developers give you, which leads me to the games weirdest decision: no saving mid-junction.

This is an issue that has come up, and where the game draws it's Tarkov-like inspiration. Each area you visit for salvage is a Junction. Your game checkpoints at the start of a Junction, but you cannot save in one. I understand the intention from the developers on why this is, but I feel like there's an easy solution to retain that intention while still giving gamers with families and real life responsibilities what they need: Save & Quit. If I need to shut the game down for whatever reason, just save when I quit. Let us resume exactly where we left off. Of course, you could still technically cheese this system using backup saves, and the intent of the game is to instill a sense of loss if you aren't successful on a run, but do we really need a Tarkov-like punishment in a game like this?

With all that said, you control how long you remain in a Junction. You can leave at any time assuming you've collected enough anchors. I've had salvage runs that last anywhere from 19 minutes to an hour. I don't think this system is as punishing as it could be, and with the variety of options to control difficulty it's almost a moot issue. I don't think it's a big enough issue to pass on the game, but I think prospective players should be aware of it in order to make an informed choice.

As for performance, I'm playing this game on an all-AMD system. Ryzen 7 5800X, an RX 7800XT 16GB, with 48GB of system RAM and an m.2 ""7gbps"" NVME. Display resolution is 2k Ultrawide. I've not run into any performance issues running on all Ultra. For whatever reason there's no FSR tech, so I'm at full resolution scale with TXAA. I've enabled AMD's image sharpening in the driver to offset TAA blurriness. I also have Fluid Motion Frames enabled, using the DX12 render pipeline. While performance can sometimes dip below 60, the majority of the game, with FMF enable is often well above 100fps. Where I'm noticing issues is the micro-stutter. The game does seem to hitch infrequently but it seems more related to texture/asset streaming than anything graphics related. Perhaps something to do with syncing between the CPU and GPU. I did notice that the only way I could get FMF enabled was running in fullscreen. For whatever reason, AMD doesn't like how this game implements borderless window. In fact, I also noticed that if windows is set to scale it's UI, that scaling applies to this game (I noticed this when using my 4k TV to play). I don't think I've ever played a game that cared about windows UI scaling, so it makes me question just how the devs setup their renderer.

All in all, this game is an easy thumbs up. I plan to spend all weekend in the PNW, and then some. If you're like me, you should too!",1708697980,1708697980,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So, the game is actually fun, as a kinda surviving-looting-mechanic focused game. You have to wander in a dangerous area, and collect all the ressources you can to improve your car and gear. So honestly, it's cool.
The story seems interesting too, and is given bit by bit by the npc on the radio.
Also, it seems your character is non genred, which is great in my opinion. 
The only problems I could say now:
Some visual glitches, and a few fps drops here and there. Seems better after the patch, tho,
The UI is a bit scary at first, but you get used to it quite fast,
You have to follow the game's pace, do not try to rush it. That's a bit unsettling, as the game sometime requires you to hurry up.

Im disappointed.

Lets best start it off with, when I play an atmospheric game, I want to immerse myself in the lore and I do want to read up on certain things, in this particularly, the Anomalies. Those are interessting enough and the scan system works well, if you look at stuff you can scan it and then you unlock a codex entry which you can read up on, in theory, like Subnautica. (For the sake of comparison)

What I do not expect, need or even want to read when I scan a cool new anomaly, is this, word for word found as an entry for an anomaly: 
""Heeeeeeeeeeeeeyyyy this is Annaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! I´m totally going so faaaaaaaaaaaaaast right now! Oh no! Oh noooooo!.."" -it goes on like this for quite some time and I hope you excuse me for the sake of you and myself, not writing all of that down. You should get the jist tho.

I do enjoy alot of different type of games and seemingly I have no standarts, if you judge by my library, but what I really dont enjoy is when I actively lose brain cells, trying to decipher information out of the dumpster fire codex entries of Pacific Drive, and I actually believe this game set the new lowest bar for codex entries for me. As a small example, I saw a flying robot thingy and thought: ""Imma scan that little clunker and find out what it is"" and thats what I did, what I expected was an entry that tells me about what it appears to be, maybe even some personal notes or theories of one of the 3 voice actors barraging your eardrums with badly written dialogue, that all have a scientific background, of which they tell you about but not behave like or talk like. But no, Im dead serious here, what you get is a huge text from random people in that universe having a random boring conversation where they, briefly, somewhere in the middle state ""it pushed our car away"". So you have to read all of that boring random garbage conversation to find out, if at all, what the thing you scanned is or what it does. I hate this. I actually literally despise it and I dont understand what kind of people look at this and go ""Yep, this is fine."".

What I also couldnt handle was the sometimes cringe but mostly just un-interessting and constant blabbering of the people through the radio. They are extremely annoying and extremely, painfully cringe. Theres nothing there that grips me or immerses me into the setting of the world. I tried turning off dialogue and subtitles but then you miss mission critical information as the mission HUD is sometimes not updating your current objective or simply not good enough, so the cringe talking had to continue, great.

So there I was, being stimulated by bad voice acting paired with bad writing, bad world building and dry gameplay mechanics, I finally decided that I would invest my money into something else. Oh and btw, this is a game where you loot about, lets say, 90% of the time. Would an option for looting the entire container be a good idea, practical even? Yes. Is that option in the game? No, it is not. At least not for people that use a controller. I feel like the people working on this title never played a video game before.

Also on a personal note, the songs on the radio seriously suck. But that might me my personal taste at fault here.",1708630985,1708687792,False,12,1,0.522417187690734863,0,True,False,False

It has been a long time that I've not only been excited for a new release, but played it on day one and loved it. It has the gameplay of Subnautica but you're driving instead of swimming. It has the lore and environment of the SCP foundation, and it has the best vibe, music and style anyone could hope for. 

This game has the incredible ability to make feel an immense sense of dread and then immediately fade it out with the thrill of the drive, music banging through the radio to create this truly awesome experience.

Only playing for a short period of time: Here are my favourite parts so far with a couple spoilers:
The first time I discovered that [spoiler] I could turn on the radio not only in the shop but also in the car absolutely changed the game for me.  [/spoiler] It seems obvious in hindsight but I didn't realise it until I discovered it for myself.

Another experience I would like to share is that [spoiler] I was seeing Tourists around everywhere (these mannequins) and I thought they were mostly just a set piece, but then I used a flare for the first time just to see what I was doing, turned around and there was an army of them staring at me. [/spoiler] Truly a horrifying experience but again, loved that I found that out naturally for myself. 

I also want to just point out the lore and story, right at the beginning of the game it's said that [spoiler] your car is a remnant and that people get attached to remnants, eventually pulling them into the instability like a siren. [/spoiler] And I loved that because it is the most immersive story it can possibly tell for such a sci-fi setting. You as the player will get more and more attached to your car as you play with it and upgrade it. You will always return to it and you won't leave it too far behind. You're constantly trying to keep it safe and when something happens to it, it's devastating.

Cons
unable to save while in the open world areas, can only do that back at the hub garage meaning you'll lose all progress if you need to leave the game to do real world tasks causing you to lose progress.

game has optimisation issues so some systems will suffer trying to run this title.

The car is definitely one of the main characters of this game, and slowly improving it by swapping and adding parts feels very rewarding.
The accessibility options are the most numerous and well-implemented I have seen in any game.

Overall, I only have two complaints: 
1. You can't save while you're out on a mission. You have to reach quest checkpoints (such as collecting some new gizmo or doodad, or reaching a specific location to perform a task) and rely on the autosave that happens at that time. Sometimes, quite a bit can happen between checkpoints.

I really like the game so far, but the progression-loss from crashes takes all the fun out of it for me.
please find a solution QUICKLY!


lets start with the positive:
I love the athmosphere. No horrorgame has yet been able to give me the creeps like this game does.
Things appearing out of nowhere... and especially the tourist... they're just f***ing terrifying <3
I love a lot of the ingame mechanics and its fun to craft and gather stuff.
upgrading your base and all feels good.
There are tons of things I like and pointing them out would be a spoiler and just be too much text for a review. ;)

the neutral:
I do like to take my time while exploring and scavanging, but on some maps the storm is cutting my time short and I'm basically allways stressed about that. I dont like that, but I can accept it (for now, even if I'd preferre to not have to run like that).
(I know there are a lot of options for gameplay, but since most of them deactivate achievements, thats not really what I want)

the bad and the reason for this review being negative:
We're not allowed to save the game, while in the field. Thats not my favorite, but I can work with that.
The game crashes. about once every 2-3 hours randomly. All progress, since entering the latest zone is gone.
This makes me angry and frustrated.
I can accept, that a game crashes. S*** happenes, not a biggy, but I've lost a lot of progress (and therefore the time I've spent) and I have no possible way to protect myself from that.
If there was some kind of backup or autosave, in addition to the autosave when entering a zone (because thats not enough imho), that would be great.

- Story/World is somewhat similar to Stalker/Roadside Picnic (maybe more so the 2nd one, then the first), with the exception of main character being a survivor rather than someone looking to profit;
- Overall gameplay loop is a mix of extraction with ""classic"" survival games - you outfit and prepare yourself and your car, embark on a expedition, you explore and loot the are (while surviving various hazards and keeping yourself and your car alive), and then escape with the loot, and repeat the loop;
- Moment to moment gameplay while driving the car is great, very tactile and immersive, and handling the car is a challenge in itself rather then being just a tool to get from point to point;
- Soundtrack and sound design are both great - 8 hours in and the tracks on the radio in the game still didn't get repetitive, car sounds and ambient noises when in the Zone are amazing;
- Graphically it's a mix of stylized materials, models, textures, with realistic lighting and atmospheric effects, in combination they look beautiful - very often wanted to just take in the views, or to make a photo of the view (unfortunately, doesn't seem like there's a photo mode in the game);
- Performance is fine, could be better, but not awful - on 6900XT in 2560x1440, 100% render res, with everything set to max, sometimes there are noticeable drops in FPS (to around 40-50), but on average it's around 80-90. There are some stutters related to shader compiling when first encountering some effects (like breaking stuff, scrapping or hitting something).

Overall, highly recommend the game, a great deal even at full price!",1708677233,1708677233,True,1,0,0.506329119205474854,0,True,False,False

Just scrolling through, I have seen several asinine comments trying to justify a poor review, and i will attempt to address most of them here so you can then go ahead and choose to buy the game based on its merits, and not based on the overly dramatic crying from a select couple neanderthals.

1) ""THE MISSIONS ARE TOO LONG AND NO SAVE MID GAME""
 -I guess you haven't played a Souls game before. Dumb reason to rip a game.

2) ""THIS GAME IS NOT FOR ANYONE WITH A LIFE""
 -If you cant justify sitting down to game for 1-2 hours when you want to game, then you should a] settle on one game to play per session, b] look at a lifestyle change if you're so unable to do what you want, or c] realize at that point maybe gaming isn't that important to you, move on to something else/game with less time demand, and take notice that's a YOU problem, not a problem with the game. A lot of people like a long session of unbroken immersion, which this game has in spades.

3) ""DON'T BUY IF YOU HAVE A JOB OR KIDS""
 -Probably the dumbest one on here. i work six days a week, 50 hours a week, and I just had myself a reasonable 90 minute session before bed. Got plenty done, advanced the story and upgraded my Wagon a good bit. Dumb, dumb, dumb- refer back to #2.

4) ""YOU LOSE EVERYTHING EVERY TIME YOU DIE NOT WORTH IT""
 -Nevermind, THIS is the dumbest one on here. This game, along with damn near every game of this genre nowadays, has a toggle for that. Actually, its THREE settings. Lose All, Lose Some, or Keep All. Which, by the way, its defaulted to Lose Some and not Lose All, so not only did these troglodytes not have the wherewithal or common sense to simply open the settings menu, but the entire basis of their gripe wasn't even fully enabled to begin with, and with the least effort possible could have been disabled completely. As can your car damage.

This is a wonderfully unique title that has so far lived up to my expectations. I've been waiting for quite a few months for this to drop, and it's a gorgeous title indeed. Working on an apocalyptic family hauler while listening to obscure Seattle sound 90's bands from a radio in the corner is oddly zen-like, and i imagine myself doing it for many hours in the coming months.

The road dips downward, and suddenly I am in a wasteland - the grass is scorched, the trees are dead, the earth has been salted by the hubris of those who came before me. To my left, the support pillars of an interstate highway stand eerily in a neat line. But the highway itself is jarringly absent - the pillars abruptly terminate into dandelions of corroded rebar, as if some leviathan force had torn the asphalt from its supports and thrown it into the sky. At the edge of the fog are dozens and dozens of shadowy figures, silent and motionless. Up the road, ribbons of vibrant energy chaotically dance in the night. The air is impossibly crisp and bears a slight scent of gasoline.

I slam on the brakes and launch myself out of my car, sprinting to a circle of darkened trailers left over from a hastily-abandoned government research project. I need to grab as much garbage and scientific crap from these trailers as I can and stuff it into the trunk of my station wagon.

There are so many different variations of Anomaly's (the enemies, and sometimes allies), that you are pretty much always finding something new each time you go out into the world.

The upgrade system has a lot of depth to it, and you can really customize your car to your liking. And not only that, but you are constantly upgrading your garage which also adds to the fun progression. 

Looting in the world itself is always interesting, and can be really tense. None of the anomalies you come across, (at least in the first 5 hours) seem to be really dangerous, and more so can cause some problems if you're not careful. Some drag your car, others make you car go haywire, losing all control of it. And some are just creepy weeping angel-like monsters who seem to move when you least expect it. 

All of that with the added pressure of region-wide events, and a storm that can appear putting the pressure on to leave, can result in some pretty fun rushes to get out of Dodge while trying to avoid everything going mental around you.

The story/lore around the world seems really fun too. While I haven't progressed too much into it, it has a fun mix of otherworldly invasion mixed with the Pacific Northwest 90s. A fun aesthetic.

I mean smooth enough that I was also streaming it without a single hitch. It turned my 85% into 100%, especially after a somewhat self-inflicted Tension Moment (see below).

I've done a few missions.  So far, much of it has been taking a rotary saw to derelict cars to hack them up into bits and shovel those bits into my pockets.  Some of the rest of that time has involved break-and-entries on abandoned buildings to take stuff.  The rest has been being amused by a trio of cranky old codgers who don't like each other trying to be ""helpful"" in their own weird ways.

There's a LOT of looting of garbage in this game.  A ridiculous amount.  There's a tool that helps to pick it all up, yeah, but I made fun of Wildlands: Breakpoint for having exactly this gameplay, so what the eff is wrong with me?  I mean really?

Atmosphere, really.  And okay, Breakpoint was broken for a whole lot more than becoming Tom Clancy's Environment Cleanup Service.  Forget I brought it up.

Where was I? Atmosphere.  Right.  It's going broadly for the same atmosphere as STALKER, in a way. (Really, more like ""Another Roadside Picnic"" amirite?  I AM RIGHT.)  There's a zone, it's got weird, unknowable things that defy the laws of physics as we understand them, and you're in the middle of it for whatever reason.  Except they've traded the Pripyat area for the Pacific Northwest and drunken Russian bandits with guns for a whole lot of cars, salvage, and upgrading your car.

Most of the time, the game has involved gently pootling down the countryside on long-neglected roads, looking for suitable salvage.  Every now and again there's a moment of stress trying to avoid a surprise storm or something.  And then there was the Tension Moment:  I elected to leave the map and charged up my exit point.  Now, the exit point was much of the way across the map--no big deal--but I had a flat tire.  And calling for an exit destablized the area.  Now I realize I have to drive like the wind on only three good tires, avoiding debris, obstacles, and anomalies that could wreck my car. (Seriously, there were dozens of ""Tourists"" in near-solid lines!)  Well, I got there closely, but that was more exciting than it needed to be.

So, anecdote aside, the game's a lot about the car.  It's not the most realistic simulator you'll ever see, that's true.  But there's a lot of car modelling in there, with the sort of fiddly attention to controls not unlike Jalopy.  It's a good lineage.  It's Jalopy-esque in that you need to source new parts for your car, but unlike Jalopy, the parts you need to keep fixing are fenders and doors, not engines and air filters.  The car's bodywork is what keeps the nasty stuff out.

But it's fiddly.  There's hotkeys you can use, sure.  Or oyu can just look at the windshield wiper stalk and use it, and there you go.  And you must look and click on the key to start the car, and the same for the gearshift to get out of park. Fail to do either and you go nowhere.  Fail to put your car in park when you're on a slope and it will coast away.  Fail to shut off your engine and it will casually sip your gas away.

There's decent car physics:  I've done a few power-oversteers.  Okay, more like ""I've spun the car out keeping the loud pedal matted while turning in slippery conditions"".  Suspension elements react to bumps.  I've managed to high-center the car once, taking a jumpramp without sufficient gusto.  I managed to rock it free with a lot of effort and some kicking.

Between this and the car maintenance, you're going to want to have some modest amount of interest in your car, or you're going to hate this game so hard.  I mean, it's fairly abstract, you don't have to manage a clutch, you've got a pump for siphoning gas, the car's transmission has only Park and Drive mode.  You're not doing iRacing, you're not gapping sparkplugs or rejetting your carburetor.  But a non-zero interest in things Car helps.

Anyway, it's been great fun and I expect I shall stream more.  I've just put my URL down here, because self-advertising is difficult.  I reckon if you read through all these inky words, you'd probably not mind watching me tear down random wreckage for a few hours while chatting.  So that's, uhh, https://twitch.tv/fdejeuner - pop in if you want, etc., etc, you know how it works.

I get out but only by using up my medkit and getting into the beacon with literally 0% health left.

Your standard day 1 issues:
Needs some performance tweaking, specifically just general optimization in the intro, and in the auto garage.

Need some improved Quality of Life:
The ability to save while out in a zone.
The ability to close the garage while inside.

Genuinely, the only major problem I have with the game is that it doesn't respect your time enough. I need the ability to suspend play at any time so I can do things besides play the game. It is unrealistic to expect me to keep the game on while I go to class or get groceries.

Once this stuff is fixed, I think the game is genuinely perfect and a must-buy. There's nothing else much like this out right now. Pacific Drive is unique, fun, the loop is entertaining, the story is engaging- I mean I guess it's a bit slow sometimes, but that just lets you take in the unique artstyle and aesthetics of this game.

It's an extraction game in a spooky zone and you have to upgrade your car, it's cool.

You cannot save mid run, this isn't Escape From Tarkov, if I didn't have a life I'd go play that - sort it out.

Such a cool concept ruined by something so simple.

I also did the tutorial completely out of alignment, I found the storm anchor really early and used it before getting to the radio antenna so it completely destroyed everything for me.

But you choose between predefined maps you want to travel along, deeper and deeper into the zone. Anomalies are randomised. With better upgrades and progressing through said maps, you will be able to take longer drives over more than one map.

Imagine if subnautica had a baby with my summer car and then an affair with SCP/stalker.

Gameplay is addictive, keeps you entertained with a good balance of highly tense missions, with beautiful atmosphere. Followed by the stress of escaping the anomalies to get back to your garage. And finally some relaxing down time, fixing your car up and modifying it.

Visuals are simple but honestly absolutely perfect for the game.

What I've found myself loving the most, is the immersion. All the little details, just make you smile. I found myself obsessing over the small detail of your cars radio sounding muffled when you stand outside with all the doors closed. But lose one of your doors, or leave it open and it blasts out the car at full volume. Having side mirrors that actually work. And all those little goodies they spent their time on very wisely.

This year has been packed with good releases already, especially within the survival genre. And this is honestly top contender for me. I intended to play for half an hour before bed, and ended up absorbed for over 3 hours.

Bonus is that the Devs seem very passionate and on the ball. Game released around 10pm my time, and since sleeping on it, they've already released two patches with an impressive amount of bug fixes/rebalances/refinements.

The mechanics of upgrading, modifying and maintaining your car are perfectly levelled and at most, all I'd like extra would be some tuning settings for the suspension. Mechanically it has just enough to be for everyone, both car people and normal people.

There are a lot of accessibility options to suit most players needs (like keeping inventory on death or removing car damage).  I haven't modified any myself but it was good to see.  More points to the devs for allowing players to customize their experience the way they want.

You have to finish the run you are on to save, and the are not 20 minute affairs but more along the lines of 1+ hours.

Other than that terrible design decision, in my opinion anyway, the rest of the game holds up nicely (so far).  The atmosphere is sufficiently oppressive to support the story, the music is great, the sound is awesome, and driving the car feels good - it connects with the environment really nicely.

There seems to be a fair amount of content and enough customisation and modification to the car that it feels like you can truly make it your own as you go along.

The tutorial and information overload at the start can be a bit offputting but if take your time on the first mission to read everythign and go through it then you will have no problems (I will say that the explanation of the car HUD/panels is pretty bad and needs to be made a lot clearer, even if that means installing each piece one after the other and having it be explained because I still dont know what some of the meters mean lol).

The performance is okay, DLSS helps a lot but there are still some annoying stutters etc that take place but its not terrible.

The sound is pretty great, the voice acting is too. Whoever did the radio sound design did a great job and the addition of optional music using the radio is great and despite some places saying this uses power, it does not. I have tested it and it uses ZERO power so BLAST THAT RADIO LOUD! :D

 TL;DR: Don't play if you can't play for more than an hour, do not play if you're scared, do not play if you feel you cannot take any risks at all, even I have to force myself to do things I do not want to, like, going into a scary risky area to enjoy the game.

EDIT: Yep, steam deck situation is grim, if you nuke the settings you can get it to 30fps, but by that point it's almost not even worth it. Shame, because this would be a great compliment for the Steam Deck.

The director said he wanted to do away with inventory management and other survival tropes but I feel like they continue in other forms, albeit to a lesser extent. This games asks you to track a lot of stuff and it's feeling a bit more difficult than I'd like. You can turn easy mode, but that means forgoing achievements, which always feels wrong to me. I don't think Amnesia games, for example, punish you in this way for playing passive mode.

My main issue with the game is the lack of a decent save system. You can only checkpoint upon entering a new region or returning to the garage, which means you'll have long stretches of 40+ minutes with no saving. I appreciate the idea is to add tension to each run, but that means you can't do a quick play. If you don't have an hour to spare this game doesn't care.

Game's pretty good for the most part, needs some extra work optimizing maps (they are rather small so i dont see why low graphics cant give more fps than they do) and the animations when a tool breaks and gets replaced, also not a huge fan of the items icons they are pretty lifeless compared to how thematic most of the game is.

As other people pointed out theres no way to save while in a mission which really sucks, i hope its a bug. The game allows you to tamper with difficulty from the get go without missing out on achievements which is huge but then theres no save function at all outside your base. You have to chose between no stakes god mode or losing all progress on death, its not even a loot issue (as theres an option to keep it) but its just time consuming. Saving is a nice middle ground, it could be free or with consumable items, special save locations in the map and/or adding checkpoints.

I do agree with everyone saying that it needs a save-and-exit feature during missions. I appreciate the devs dedication to making those outings feel genuinely risky by preventing the player from saving and loading every time they do something stupid, I think that's exactly the right way to build this game, but we need to be able to stop playing and resume where we left off. Most of us have fairly busy lives, and our schedule isn't always predictable. Check out survival mode in Fallout 4. You can save and stop wherever you like, but if you die you have to restart from last time you actually used a bed. It's perfect. This game could do the same.

You have a limited inventory but it has a nice balance of having enough space but you will also have moments where you will choose what to take with you if you have a long expedition. I was surprised to see this game isn't open world but more 'open segments' I grew to like it. I still have a lot to do and a lot to unlock it feels like I might be 15-25% through the main story. Talking about the story it is fine, it has this problem for me personally where I find it hard to focus on the conversations that play out on your radio (which is till now all dialogue and no face-to-face). I do think the voice acting is really good and who knows the story will come together for me in the end. I do think it is a game where the 'un-clearness' of the story could work for it instead of against it. The driving is not as 'your car is a total piece of ****' as I heard from other reviewers. I was thinking it would be a first person 'mudrunner' kinda game but it is way easier to control the car even from the beginning. I maybe would've liked it if the car was a bit more as if I am driving an actual 'car I found on the side of the road that has been there for years at the very least', but it isn't bad at all. I think the game might be a little easy, as an example if you just somewhat pay attention to your fuel or your battery you'll be just fine (at least in the first 6 hours), I have died once and it felt totally fair because I didn't bring equipment which was just not smart of me. I did have a moment where I survived with 2% health left and that felt very well balanced and that situation probably wouldn't have played out like that if it wasn't a set difficulty. I could easily see the devs adding a hard-mode in the game that would be maybe even better than the difficulty we have now. Again, I do feel like the game is a little easy at times (which also adds to the relaxation part of the game) and I think that the car being more 'wrecked' would add to the experience of actually beiong stuck in the middle of nowhere.

I played a good hour+ of the Demo and now 80-90 minutes of the full game, and I'm thoroughly impressed so far. The car handling is great but challenging enough at times to punish you a little for getting cocky. I love the attention to detail with the car, and how well thought-out the tutorial missions are to get you used to the very cluttered and complex inventory and crafting menus.

I found myself growing accustomed to the UI within an hour or two. It's a lot, but it's quick to grasp. Soon, you'll be scrapping everything you can lay your eyes on, scanning all sorts of contraptions and anomalies. On top of this, the subtitled dialogue from the three scientists over the radio is fantastic. It's easy to cringe at dialogue in games, especially if it feels rehearsed, but this comes across brilliantly.

Where I find this game excels - and surprised me - is the atmosphere. The low thrum of music in the background and the environmental noises of creaking metal, rustling leaves and otherworldly shrieks and groans keep you on edge the second it's been quiet for too long. You'll find yourself apprehensive and wanting to stick to your car.

Specs: Running on a 10th Gen i5 and a 1660 Super with 16gb RAM, this runs pretty good on mostly Ultra settings with a few moments of stutter here and there. Otherwise brilliant!

Pros: 
- Car looks sick inside,
- Lore Lore Lore Lore, gotta scan, gotta read, LOREEEEE. 
- Voice acting very good. 
- Only 1 bug so far. 
- Crafting, management, and repairing pretty good. RE4 style inventory.
- Don't like some difficult things such as time limit for instability and other stuff? You can turn it off. That was my major complaint from the demo which is now fixed.

Cons:
- Car driving is fake. The car acts like a cvt and there is no PRNDL or stepped gearing. Car has way too much grip on road, spins out easily on dirt. 
- TEDIUM, god acquiring resources is tedious. You have so many and burn through them fast. 
- UI is a mess. No QOL features and it doesn't pause the game. 
- No exit saves so if you are on a long drive/loot run, see it through or bye bye items. I get its hard but life doesnt care. As a volunteer fire fighter this is not good for me.

Five crashes with in the span of 1hr, all of which I had to restart the into/tutorial three times. Crashed on the first mission after about twenty minutes of game play. Eventually I got fed up after a hard crash that soft locked my computer.

The atmosphere is very thick, the art is just utterly terrific and I'm enjoying both the easy-to-understand gameplay loop and very subtle storytelling. But you should really manage your expectactions.

This game is not My Summer Car. Everything about upgrading and maintaining your steel horse is casual in a good way. Plus car handling is simple and as arcade as it gets.

This game is not a survival and crafting openworld either. While both elements are present, it's more about immediate gameplay moments than constant grind. World is not open, your exploring consists of chains of smaller locations.

If anything, Pacific Drive is a great rogelite (every run is unique) with heavy emphasis on how unpredictable the Zone truly is. You can (and will) hoard recpies and resources, but they won't save you thanks to tons of anomalies and truly dark nights. Also. I don't get the mid-save critique. Runs are usually quite manageable time-wise: 20 to 30 minues, the locations are not that big. If you can't spare half an hour on a run, I guess you have bigger problems than creative choices in videogames.

Car handling is surprisingly faithful too! Really love how a flat tire could botch an entire run. As IRL Volvo S90 Royal owner I adore how true-to-life the overall experience with long 1998 car is, especially the dreaded turning radius.

On the game loop, you explore areas to progress the story, gather crafting ingredients and before you leave each zone you need to gather a particular resource that allows you to warp back to your home base. This resource is also used for using the upgrade station (on top of the crafting ingredients) 

The world is scary and you do feel you and your car are fighting for your life some times if the right random anomalous conditions are rolled. 

The upgrade tree which includes upgrades to you (e.g. backpack size), your car (paneling, engines, new abilities), and your base (machines to make servicing your car easier or breaking down old parts) can be a little overwhelming at first but it's a lot of fun on the old style computers you find in the game.

There are lots of supporting features to keep the game interesting, my favorite thus far being the Quirk system, in which your car acquires certain behaviors (of varying impact on your experience) that need to be diagnosed (cause > effect) and then fixed if you deem it necessary. These can range from cute (closing your trunk causes horn to go off) to impairing (steering flickers the headlights) to full on dangerous (turning on your wipers makes the car steer violently to the right).

Has a quite lovely atmosphere, Rain, Fog and the occidental huge red ball of radiation, beautiful game.

Main problem, The game makes my GPU turn into a space heater, and run at 85c, I am running at NVIDIA RTX 2070
Which while neither Great nor Terrible, one might want to make sure to follow the recommendation from the devs, and get/have a 30xx Series or one of those RX 7000 AMDs, but I don't know much about GPUs, just that mine is rather outdated.

The game does also feel a bit small, as you a mainly travelling throguh gates into new zones, I would have loved for it to be bigger, or open world.

Else the game is pretty fun, the driving feels quite, do I wish I had a real steering wheel sometimes, but if you like driving around, dodging hazards and collecting many different things, or maybe you liked the STALKER series and wanted to play it, like i did, then this game might be for you.",1708636581,1708636714,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For starters I have about 3 hours into the game when I actually unlocked the Deluxe Edition Option. Which means I am now past the point to ask for a refund on Steam, as will most who buy the Deluxe Edition. The deluxe addition gives you a hand full of trinkets that are pictured. Which is kinda of fine. The problem I have is that the vast majority of the customization options, ""some of which are part of the Deluxe"" are 80% gender identification options. For example, there is a total of 25 different stickers you can have on the back of you car. Two of them are space themed, and one of them is a BLM flag. The other 22 options are ""input your gender Identity here"" flag stickers. Which on its own wouldn't upset me, if there were other options like say a country flag.....Like any flag from any country or any other sticker for that matter. Can you get more later in the game? Maybe, but why is every stock/starter option political/gender themed. Honestly If I would have known before 2 hours that 80%-90% of the customization options were gender/political focused. I would have probably either got the base game at some kind of sale. As don't care to support your political agenda, but the game is fun on its own. I just don't wan't others to be informed that If you get the deluxe its only for 8 cosmetic items, and if you don't want' politics down you throat while you play then you'll only use 7 of them or less.

The graphics are terrible and the lighting is about the worst I have ever experienced in a game. In the day time when you enter a building it is pitch black inside. You need to be using road flares to see anything, even after boosting the brightness in the game settings. There is no flashlight. At night, everything is pitch black, so you need to be making road flares all the time just so you can see 5 feet in front of you. There is no way to fast forward the night either, which seemed to last for about 2 hours or game play.

Since it is a driving game I started using my controller, but it is seriously bugged out. When you are in any of the options screens, the controller skips windows and options. For example, scrolling down the controls list in the option settings, it skips every second option or so, making it impossible to change any type of settings with the controller. Even in the car, the controller causes you to miss half of the options by skipping over them. You push once and it skips the next one and highlights the third instead.

The car is such a piece of garbage that I just stopped caring about it after a few hours of game play. Driving it about 2 miles or so deteriorates every part of the car including all body panels (even if you don't hit a single thing with the car). So, you need to be repairing it all the time which is tedious and annoying. Also, it drives like a WW1 tank.

The game is very linear, there is no replayability to it. You drive down these single roads that are point to point and every 50 meters there is a something blocking the road. Pointless road blocks like a barrel with blockades around it or a huge pile of rocks that looks like it just dropped from the sky. There are also these flying robots everywhere that stick suction cups to the car and then it drags the car into the roadblocks or just smashes you into trees.

In the beginning I was spending all my time trashing old abandoned cars (which all look exactly the same) to get materials, which in fact, I found out I didn't really need. There is no save function, unless you are back at the garage, so when I left the game after 1.5 hours to go get something to eat, I ended up losing all my progress and it started me back at the beginning of the game.

The buildings in the game are all just copy and pasted from about 5 different models or so. The world is empty of any life, other than yourself. The entire experience just felt bland, pointless and frustrating. Since I cannot get a refund, being past the 2 hour mark, I will just be uninstalling and hiding the game, as I won't be touching this dissapointment again.",1708634362,1708634362,False,4,0,0.385660290718078613,0,True,False,False

The atmosphere is great giving deep dark mystery kinda vibes.

There are currently some performance issues causes GPU to pretty much always be at 85-95% usage regardless of settings (I have a 3060Ti, run ultra settings and lowered all lighting based options such as reflections and shadows etc. get around 60-110 FPS depending on areas) and CPU usage I have yet to see go above 25% which is shocking.

Other than that the only con I have with this game is the damn storms man, they are so unbelievably atmospheric and real which is great, except for when your in your garage and you can't close the garage door, essentially meaning 24/7 all you hear is thunder and lightening mixed in with hard rain over everything else, other than that I'd say 9/10.

++ Atmospheric and immersive environment, especially the weather effect is 10/10
+ Enjoyable driving experience, radio available with good playlist
+ You can customize the difficulty / gameplay features of the game, with large variety of option. Achievement will only disable if you disable player damage, player death, or car damage

Firstly, the game exhibits a multitude of minor bugs, such as car clipping issues and malfunctioning volume controls on the Jukebox/Car Radio, alongside other various user interface bugs that arise during specific scenarios.

A persistent presence of typos and grammatical inconsistencies throughout the game's dialogue and text. For Example: ""Such as repeated words words within sentences. And misplaced punctuation."" These flaws detract significantly from the game's professionalism and disrupt the immersive experience.

Furthermore, an excessive number of LGBTQIASABCEDHI+ flags are plastered within the garage's cosmetic decals. Over 25+ different ones to be exact. It serves no purpose and has no relevance within the game's context and setting. These flags do not fit the game's established aesthetic at all.

First game I've pre-ordered a game since The Divison 2 and I'm blown away by how fantastic the game is so far. You're put into a world you don't belong in, with dangers just like in Roadside Picnic.
The game has an incredibly rich atmosphere and very good voice work between the characters. All combined with the fantastic driving model and raid based gameplay loop that makes the story progress at a good pace, making every run into the zone fresh with new dialogue.
I also greatly enjoyed upgrading my base and car with upgrades that physically show up. All the small details like the aforementioned upgrades and how you interact with every different part of your garage and car are very immersive.
The graphics look great, while being stylistic they somehow manage to look realistic in a lot of scenes. My pc also has an easy time running it at over 100 fps with dlss on.

You will have to interact with your car similar to how my summer car does it (only a lot less jank). So if you don't like having to stop/start your car and put it in drive every time you get out and collect items, this game might not be for you.

Devs: Please add an accessibility option to save whenever you want, since a lot of people are asking for it (Although it probably needs a bigger rework of the save system if that's the case).

It's a console game for kids and young adults - which is fine.  But f you're expecting something more serious and immersive (S.T.A.L.K.E.R. with cars) you'll also be disappointed. 

You ""repair"" the car by slapping putty on it, change tires in a few seconds without any tools, install a handbrake system in seconds, build a 3-story antenna using a magical box you can carry around in your hands, craft magical power tools in seconds using scrap, plastic and rubber, and many other totally immersion-breaking game mechanics. 

The attempt to make driving seem more realistic by forcing you to turn the ignition key and shift between Drive and Park every 4 minutes gets old REALLY quickly.

The gameplay loop of fast-traveling to yet another tiny sector to disassemble derelict cars with your magical buzzsaw, loot buildings for more of the same useless crap and activate a fast-travel portal taking you back to the garage gets old after your first few expeditions.

Everything about it is delightfully streamlined and smooth without being too simplistic, but at the same time nothing is too opaque or hard to grasp because the game seems to delight in telegraphing exactly what to expect of a thing when it appears.

The crafting system is beautifully intuitive, bridging the appropriate storage to the benches from the moment you begin so there's no stupid ""survival game inventory shuffle"" like is unbearably typical of that genre's fondness for ""realistic"" tedium. And having the wagon's stats (component integrity, fuel, battery) be your focus, rather than mandating you consume an ocean and the caloric density of a star with every solar cycle, makes for a pleasant experience, the maintenance becoming a relaxing and comfortable ""ritual"" prior to setting out on another run.

Now, if driving around in the Pacific Northwest version of STALKER's Zone doesn't sound like fun, I suspect this may not be the game for you. But for me, the juxtaposition of an eldritch nightmare technohorror world and a quirky little station wagon is an absolute win, as death is merely beyond your windscreen a lot of the time.

======================================

I will note, however, that there has seemingly been a pretty big shift from the demo: a lot of the difficulty settings no longer note that they disable achievements for enabling them, which (assuming it isn't a bug) is a big win for accessibility much like Hades' ""God Mode"" or Rogue Legacy 2's ""House Rules"" features, focusing on providing an enjoyable experience over a one-size-fits-all ""but thou must"" difficulty.

That gets old very quickly, because you exit and enter car all the time.

The inventory management is annoying. The tools degrade quickly with every use and you end up crafting the basic tools over and over again.

most negative reviews seem to be about the individual ""levels"" not having an active save option (meaning the game only saves at the end of a successful run, similar to games like stardew valley that save at the end of the day). the frustration is understandable, but personally im okay with this system. likely the saves only happening at the end of each successful run is a dev design decision, and rightfully so given things may not feel as fun if you can save and reload every 30 seconds when things turn south. a design decision i agree with, because gamers would min max the fun out of their game otherwise. the escape sequences at the end of each level may feel trivialised if you could just reload it over and over till you're home safe. 

Just my thoughts! still early in the game and this game feels like the best parts of Prey, The Long Dark, Deathloop (the loopy part, which was the only good part of the game), and bits and pieces of other survival games I cant recall for now.

[h3][b]✅THE PROS✅[/b][/h3]
[list]
[*]The feel of the game is great, I am still figuring out the story, characters, etc. But I like that the plot feels fresh to me.
[*]The art is beautiful. I love the colors, contrasts and scenery. They did a great job setting the ambiance of the game.
[*]I am a huge fan of survivals and simulators, the whole crafting/destroying thing scratches that Stardew Valley itch, especially the sounds, great ASMR feeling.
[/list]

[h3][b]❌THE CONS❌[/b][/h3]
[list]
[*]UI is a little crowded. Menu could use better boundaries to improve visibility, but I like the 80's interface look.
[*]The environment interaction mechanics are a bit confusing at first, somewhat un-intuitive, but you can edit control bindings in the settings (controller bindings are not as varied, so if you play with controller, you might find this a little frustrating). I'm still playing with my controller because I'm stubborn, but it would probably be best for keyboard/mouse.
[*]Very minor, but the style of the game as a whole (more specifically, the menus) aren't all the way cohesive. The pause menu feels like it's from a completely different game.
[*]Lastly, I am not into games that hand hold and spoon feed you info every step of the way, but I did spend like... a good 5 minutes frustrated with the fact that I couldn't focus past the ""Open Inventory"" overlay in the middle of the screen. Might be that I'm too anxious, or the fact that I had no idea when the message would disappear. I think this should be to the side, maybe highlighted in some way. Also, I had no idea why it was like that until I went in and clicked through all of the new highlighted items. Confusing.

Did the tutorial, and I'm already loving it, will update review accordingly.

The game runs wonderfully (3050 Laptop GPU, 16GB RAM). It's got amazing sounds, visuals, voice acting. The scrapping is fun very exciting to go into the scary outside to continue story and find more parts to make my car even better.
It has an awesome grid based inventory system too! (That's always a plus).

It's a but more expensive than most indie titles, but the devs seem to really care about their project and I feel it is worth the work I can see so far.

****BUYER BEWARE****

I want to love this game, and hopefully I will one day, but currently I am getting a consistent crash forcing a reboot upon reaching Oppy's garage, causing the game to be unplayable past that point.

I've played the opening section 4 times now, with a crash occurring at the same point each time, forcing a PC reboot. The autosave takes me back to an earlier point in the opening section, but I cannot progress as it crashes once I reach the same point. It seems 100% consistent, and I'm unwilling to try a 5th time until a patch.

I will likely amend this review if the issue is resolved before my refund window expires.

The car upgrading is the best part since it really connects you with the car and makes you rather obsessive over it (kinda the point of the story) from refitting the whole car to fixing a puncture you have full control over what you do with it. This is how I imagine ""Choo Choo Charles"" but that lacked a lot of the depth and fun that comes with tinkering with a vehicle which this absolutely nails.

The game essentially consists with you travelling around to procedurally generated areas collecting resources and figuring things out as the story progresses, to combat the repetitiveness there is A LOT of things that can happen from anomalies to genuinely interesting layouts and enemies. My favourite enemy (only one I've really encountered so far apart from anomalies) being one that will literally grab you (or your car) and pull/throw you about and then runs off if you go underneath it's spotlight. There are also a tonne of anomalies, some I've barely encountered but seen from a distance.

Only 2 hours in so far but I'm absolutely loving it (The demo portion + an hour), performance is hit and miss, sometimes it runs at solid 60 and other times it dips hard to around 40, it seems mirrors might be the biggest performance hit so lowering them might help. Hopefully they release some more patches to smooth the performance out.

Rain also STILL needs a buff, they said that the demo rain wasn't that intense on purpose but the next mission I had after the demo section had a full on storm and it still barely makes a difference whether you use wipers or not which is a shame but not a game breaking issue but if they can make it so the rain will smear or cause insane condensation or anything to give a reason to use them that'd be great.

TWO asks from the Devs though -
1. As many pointed out, not being able to save your game more frequently is not a great design choice - people have lives outside of gaming.

I spent two hours in the first mission and, because I didn't realize what was going on, almost died right at the end. I made it out with 14% health.

If I had died, and lost all that stuff, I'd be damn close to quitting. I *hate* doing things over again, its not fun and the anxiety that builds the longer I play with no anchor also isn't fun.

I get it. Its supposed to be a risk, going out on a mission. Sure. But when the game encourages exploration, and gives you tons of stuff to scavenge, not allowing the player to save is cruel. It doesn't make me want to stick around and absorb the atmosphere. It means, get in, get out, take zero risks, because you might lose a ton of that effort.

The fact that any small life event that you have to attend to could force you to quit without saving, or at least leave the game running paused, is just not practical.

The arbitrary lack of a save within the missions away from the home base is a major major deal breaker for anyone who has a family or busy life. Can't spend two to three hours playing? Well, you can't play.

TL;DR - There should be an option to enable saves anywhere, with a separate option to play ""Hardcore mode"" or, like, ""Pacific Mode"" whatever you want to call it, where saves are only allowed at base. Let the diehards play that way. The devs let you adjust a ton of other difficulty related settings, just add another one.

What to expect?
You drive around in an old station wagon to these different areas to collect loot and upgrade your car to reach your goal (No spoilers). If you want a somewhat Erie game that will keep you on your toes while driving an old station wagon, then this game is for you.
