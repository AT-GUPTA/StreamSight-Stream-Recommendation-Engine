Snake didn't give me any instructions, the text was skipped and the game is over. Thank you for wasting your life.

To be able to do something like that after the game has been out for so long...

Then a lot of things are not explained - hours of time are wasted trying to get the days over and try out new things.

Why not get the instructions at the church table when you're investigating something? Because that would be too simple and logical and it would be much more fun to force people to read through spoilers instead of integrating it into the game.

But after the gender thing and the riot, you died anyway.

Never another game from you!

PS.: Are you still integrating LGBTQ and why not get tested for your gender? Maybe you're in the wrong body and need a gender change to not only be politically correct with such nonsense, but also to make bug-free games that are self-explanatory!",1708961828,1708961828,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- In the progress tree that saving for a new expensive progress leads to nothing because the new recipe is hidden and needs some material that you cant acquire yet. 
- Different zones for crafting stations and different methods for crafting. The wiki was my friend otherwise I think I would dropped the game. A lot of running back and forth between many stations with a lot of materials just in the chain you forgot to bring right amount and no way to look up right material except for the wiki.

Pros:
- Pleasant pixel art
- Relaxing
- Pretty good sandbox
Cons:
- Almost impossible to play without googling
- Bad balancing
- Little difference between in-game activities

Pretty pleasant and relaxing pixel-art game, based on resource management and crafting. There are plenty of things to occupy yourself most of the time. The story seems a bit interesting but quest task are mostly about submitting items and their steps are too big, requiring several hours to get the needed items. The second thing is that there are no distractions between activities in the game. It is too monotonous, so you eventually may get bored.

Complex manufacturing and tech tree that can be rewarding but the game lacks any way to really keep track of recipes and blueprints outside of specific areas.  For a game that revolves heavily around building and creating, I find it frustrating that I have to use out of game and immersion breaking tools to keep track of the vast amount of manufacturing.  It really needs some way to pin a recipe or blueprint or keep a journal so that the player doesn't have to either memorize the ingredients needed, write it down outside of game, or keep the wiki up and tab out of game.  One other way that would be helpful is to at least have the blueprints available in the tech tree as you unlock tech.  

I really like the trial and error aspect of alchemy but [spoiler] it would be nice if when you studied an item to see if it can be decomposed and then after you decomposed it into either a powder or solution, that item then told you what type it decomposed into instead of staying grayed out as a general powder or solution.  Again, having to either memorize or look up what an item can decompose into is annoying and frustrating.

[b]Content Itself[/b]
There is a lot of content for a game that can finish under 40 hours. You probably don't even need to use them after dealing with the quests. If you're going for a completion, sure. You might use them one more time. But, this is not the worst thing. From what people say, some DLCs make the core game easier and that means it's P2W, weird to see something like that in a single-player game.

[b]Quests[/b]
Quests don't help too much either. You go to the x guy, he leads you to y. She says she wants you to go z. You go z, z wants some items and leads you to c. It is not the worst experience in the world but I didn't have too much fun running for one another. Sometimes NPCs don't spawn when they are supposed to. If that happens, you need to save, restart the game, and wait for a whole week. There were some more tilting bugs like this too, but especially towards mid-game, the game suffocates you with so many quests. You can easily divert your focus to other ones.

[b]Mid-Late Game[/b]
The Lore of the game is nothing spectacular, maybe it changes via DLC but I only played the game itself. And after the actual grind and hard quests started, I had to stop every 1-2 hours because every 30 mins I was facing a wall that would take me another 30 mins to actually go through. That goes like that the entire game but not in a good way. Especially towards the last hours, none of the things I do felt like an accomplishment. And I didn't want to call it quits too, since I was already close to finishing the game.

[b]Summary[/b]
If you like grinding by doing the same things over and over, you might like it. The way quests were implemented in the game was not fun to me, too. I'd not recommend this one.",1707045087,1707045087,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

On the plus side, I can say that I was captivated by the beautiful and polished pixel graphics. The complexity of the mechanics and the extensive tech tree. Quests and characters - especially in the DLC where I could discover new levels of character profiles. The sense of humor and subtle and clever references to culture, pop culture and history made me really enjoy playing. The time it took me to do all the achievements was about 90 hours (I would have had a lot less but I made a mistake and had to make a new save) so time-wise the game is worth its price. If you're not sure wait for sale. My recommendation is to buy it with all DLCs.

On the downside, the game is overkill. I spent most of my time on the Wiki (one of the best fan game wikis I've seen, by the way). Although developing new things and unlocking new technologies gave a lot of dopamine, to get to something you have to do a series of quests, unlock a dozen other technologies, grow X golden vegetables, to do 3 quests with 6 other NPCs to get one of them to give you a new technology to build a new machine you need to make 2 new items for 4 other quests and technologies.

Yes. Absolutely loved it.

PRO POINTS OF THE GAME :

What does it offers?

1 - Graveyard management for starters. You can spell Boobs with the graves so that's like 5 million points to Gryffindor.

2 - Funny and interesting stories, the Stranger Sin is a really great DLC for lore dump. Loved it.

3 - Fishing for those who like that...

4 - Medical students can perform autopsies here ALL the time for free without any issues,

5 - Very nice visual style and beautiful arts. The pixel art of the game is so detailed it shows the game was made with lot of love.

6 - Other than that Zombie automation.

7 - Probably other things I am missing right now.

CONS OF THE GAME :

1 - *SIGH* It's the Better save Soul DLC. The game is bugged and won't let you progress this DLC. So far I found no ingame way to help. I looked on Steam's discussion forum for previous player's saves, downloaded it and in their saves the DLC worked properly so I went and completed it.

2 - There is fishing in this game.

3 - There are areas mentioned in game like the ""TOWN"" that plays big into the game's story but it's not in game because the Devs didn't make it.

4 - 4-5 years on and the  game bug/ glitch people have cried over still exists so the Devs have moved on and there likely won't be any patches. Any bug you encounter? You're on your own.",1706388142,1706388142,True,33,1,0.794854342937469482,0,True,False,False

[h1] Summary [/h1]
Graveyard keeper is a ""cozy"" game with darker theming than you would conventionally get in a sandbox.
The story follows an isekai'd millennial who's reborn as the keeper of a medieval fantasy graveyard, and who has to find a way back to his loved one. 

[h1] Achievement hunting [/h1]
Though the achievements aren't particularly difficult, this game can be incredibly grindy regarding achievements, and thus I recommend putting aside at least 50 hours. (DLC required to complete)

[h1] Pros/cons [/h1]
[b] Pros [/b]
-Enjoyable writing and story
-A lot of stuff to do to keep you busy
-Alternate routes for the same quest can usually be applied

[b] Cons [/b]
-Incredibly grindy and slow at times
-Tends to stutter late game (tech points make this considerably worse)
-Can be very unclear on what it expects the player to do at times

[h1] Opinion [/h1]
I want to start this off by saying that I do personally enjoy this game a lot. It has a lot of content to bite your teeth into, it has a nice story to follow, great music... But I do want to mention that the DLC are what makes this game as good as it is. The Breaking Dead DLC is included in the base game (luckily), but I highly recommend getting the Stranger Sins and Game of Crone DLC if you want to actually get the full experience.

Better Call Soul was an incredibly weak and mostly useless DLC in my personal experience (yes you can make better corpses with it, but that's useless if you don't minmax the graveyard), and the only real upside of it for casual play is the wall crematorium  [i] which should be in the base game. [/i]

The game has generally pretty good flow as you'll always be doing something until you start rounding off the quests. That said, this game works on a 6 day system (1 per important npc) which can slow down the pace considerably if you need a specific npc. This can be quite painful as even with meditating, it can take like 10 minutes to loop back around to the same day. 

[h1] tldr; [/h1]
Grindy, but fun.

[h3]Things I liked[/h3]

The story itself wasn't super deep but I did enjoy the characters. Each one of them has a funny little voice that matches their personality. Building out the actual Graveyard was also pretty fun too. You get a good amount of options for decorations and by the end it looks pretty beautiful. 

I appreciate that the world isn't super massive. Sometimes games like this aren't sized accordingly and that can get frustrating. The art was also pretty delightful and very cohesive. Everything seemed to fit in the environment and most entities were easy to tell apart. 

There is a semi-global inventory which I wish other games had. If you have items in a chest in the vicinity of a workspace, it can pull directly from them. This saves a lot of time and trouble especially late game when you need to work with a lot of different items.

The weekly prayer mechanics were really nice and always gave you a reason to perform one because you get buffs when you do.

There were some funny little moments throughout the game and I found myself laughing a lot especially whenever the donkey says anything. 

[h3]Things I didn't like[/h3]

The crafting loop in this game can be a nightmare. For example, making wine requires at least 10 steps. First you have to go to a vine press and open an accordion panel then click multiple times to select the quality of grapes you want to work with. Then you have to press another key to actually create the juice. From there you can finally put it in a wine barrel but you have to select the quality again. This is most likely because you can mix qualities and get a percent chance of having a slightly better quality item created.

There are a lot of items that don't serve a purpose, or that you only use for a quest once but you can still make them. Often times I'd find myself not realizing this until it was too late and I'd waste a lot of time. The dungeon is a single play-through area and once you are done with it, that's it. Some of the areas in the game like the quarry you only visit to automate things in so it feels like a lot of wasted environment which is odd for a game that is so small map-wise. 

A few of the quest lines can bug out and cause you to miss out on certain recipes.

You can just sell anything to anyone. Which would be understandable if you could sell everything but even the vendors that can accept certain classes of items only accept very specific items. You end up with a lot of gear or items you just can't sell. Which means you make money really slow. But that doesn't matter since there isn't really much to buy in the game. 

I wish there were even more decorative items for the cemetery, even if it was just skins or things that don't influence anything other than aesthetics. 

The last few quest loops in the game take FOREVER. You sometimes find yourself waiting a week, only to turn an item in and then wait another week. There is a mechanic to time hop but its still really slow and I found myself watching YouTube videos or doing other things to occupy my time just so I could get to the final parts of the game. There really wasn't a reason for that and I'm not sure what prompted such a weird decision for that. 

It can also be really hard to tell what you are supposed to be doing at any point. There isn't a quest lot but rather a list of NPCs which sometimes lists a task you have for them. 

You HAVE to play this game with the wiki open at all times or someone in a voice call with you who has played it before. Otherwise you will get stuck constantly especially when it comes to alchemy and the mechanics around corpses. 

[h3]Final Thoughts[/h3]

Even though I found myself frustrated towards the end of the game, and there are a lot of things here that really annoyed me, I would still recommend this game. The theme is fairly original and its a nice addition to the slice of life, farm sim genre that goes about things in its own way. 

Just make sure you have the wiki open and you are prepared to spend 30 minutes to an hour time hopping for a few quests at the end game. 

The price of the game is fine for what it is though I think I'd probably recommend getting it on sale if you can.

Having now played all of it, I have to argue that this was not a good game. To make things simple I'll just go through the pros and cons, but first it has to be acknowledged that Graveyard Keeper is a complete rip off of Stardew Valley but much rougher around the edges.

Pros
- The dialogue is quite entertaining. I particularly like the communist donkey and the rogue Snake who dislikes you while also trusting you completely and relying on you for everything.
- The start of the game, when it's introducing you to the game's mechanics, is really fun. The quests in this part of the game feel like they have a point and learning about the grave-tending mechanic is fun, even if it is very poorly explained in the game and you will have to look up guides online.


Cons
- The actual grave-digging and grave-tending mechanics are barely worked into the story. When I bought the game I expected these mechanics to weave into the story, hearing about the actions of some of the corpses you're given and having to decide how they best should be buried or cremated, or if they're just thrown in the river. Or perhaps you face some difficult choices where certain townsfolk want you to bury them in the cemetary but others want him thrown in the river for their own reasons. This NEVER happens and I regard it as a huge missed opportunity.
- The quests are all fetch quests, which is fine at the start, but then at the end of the game they get so repetitive.
- WAITING becomes a major part of the game at the end of the game. I seriously think I spent an hour of game time just waiting for the time when quests would advance.
- THE GRIND! OH MY GOD! There's a point, which I got to around halfway into the game, where you need to grind for a lot of money. I was fine with this, until I then came to the above point where the late-game quests require you to wait for so long that there's nothing left for you to do because, in the main grind, you will have gathered absolutely everything you need.
- The dungeon is an awful part of the game which you just have to get through. For better or worse, there is no penalty for dying. If you can't be bothered to walk back to the entrance of the level you're currently on then it's actually a bonus as death teleports you back to your bed and you lose nothing from it. My main issue with it is that this game is clearly not based around combat, so why include it? And if you are going to include it, at least make it engaging. I think it's there because Stardew Valley had the mines, but the developers should be reminded that the mines are not the bit of Stardew Valley which people enjoyed. If people want to fight through dungeons, they will play something that specialises in that, not a farming sim!
- Speaking of things ripped straight from Stardew Valley, did they have to use the exact same fishing minigame? It's more forgiving that the one in Stardew Valley, but that doesn't mean it's not boring and repetitive. 
- Mentioned this briefly in my pros section, this game does not explain things well. Why, for the love of god, do you have to ""use"" the bucket of water to turn it into water that you can actually use? What is the point in this? There is nothing in the game that requires a whole bucket of water and it's not like this game is going for an especially realistic tone. This gets worse when you get to the alchemy tables where literally everything is a guess, along with the zombies you can use to work for you. The game doesn't explain any of these things and you will need to google it to get the recipes required to use them. Speaking of the game being pointlessly opaque...
- Alchemy and embalming are frustrating, and embalming itself is completely pointless unless you're going for maximum graveyard quality. I literally never used the embalming table.
- The Town. This isn't specifically a con but I feel like, had it been included, then it would have given some more variety to the quests, which is something the game desperately needs. Instead you get told about the town for most of the game, and even at one point get a pass to go there, which I was really excited about. I thought this game was already pretty big and was looking forward to meeting new NPCs. Unfortunately, the game just blocks you from going there and uses the opportunity to make you the subject of a kind of rubbish joke. Another missed opportunity.
- Finally, but by no means least importantly, is the inventory management. For some reason, on your little farm/graveyard/church, which feels like it's a separate cell on the map, you can only use the stuff you have in your inventory and in the immediate vicinity. Why can you not just take stuff straight from your main inventory? I can understand, if you're going further afield, that you need to bring building supplies and equipment with you, but in your own home it just feels like this game is wasting your time.


Honestly, it's a real shame, I think this game has potential. Some of the cons can be fixed really easily (here's a tip guys, start with the inventory one!) and if the grave-keeping/tending mechanic was actually woven into the story then it might have been a little bit more engaging to run your graveyard, but as it stands there is no point doing so after you've completed one of the early quests for the priest. The quests need variety, 99% of them are just ""bring me this thing,"" and then when you complete it the next quest is ""thanks for that, now bring me this other thing."" Moreover, the game wastes so much of your time with grinding and waiting that I just cannot recommend it for anyone who values their time.

1. 30% of the game comes with DLC. It, in the first place, includes achievements, where base game actually gives you only about half of achievements, but also completing game without DLC is quite long and grindish, since all DLCs supposed to be played alongside main story, not after it. With DLC it's quite easy and chill to complete game in, I guess, 80-100 hours, just like Stardew.
2. Lack of hints and bios for items. Quite decent amount of items that you need for quests are unknown to you and you can't learn how to make them right in the game, there's always need for wiki when doing story. When you unlock building in skill tree game does not tell you where you can build it, there's few spots where new building can be available and without wiki you would need few minutes to find it by yourself.
Game worth its cost and time you would spent on it, but to fully enjoy it I'd advice you to buy DLCs earlier than 20 hours of gameplay, at least.",1689145129,1706027382,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The game is bottle necked with so many different tools to build certain items, not to mention the sub assembly requirements for other items. I found it very difficult to remember what the workbenches were called after having them built, it became a trial and error adventure for certain items I wanted to craft.

I was so excited to see the amount of skill trees and technology that could be researched, although it quickly became overwhelming and overall too much information for such an early part of the game.

It doesn't teach you how to make the bodies better quality, which is vital to the progression of the game, or how I should be making any money besides bodies. It just leaves you entirely to your own devices with very little direction. This can be fun a lot of the time, like in SDV for instance, but in this game it just doesn't work. You need to teach players how to use certain aspects of the game. There's handful of 'tutorials' when you encounter new things, but it only explains what the icon for it is, and vaguely what it does, not how to use them. And this is still only for a select *few* things, not everything you'll be using. Please give me an option for a tutorial. 

The second issue I have with this game is minor for some people, but there is absolutely NO character customization. No gender, no hair, no clothes, nothing. I believe the dev at one point said this was because it is a story-driven game, and so we must play as a man with a beard as it is his story. I just really don't understand this point at all, the story in this game could so easily be applied to any little pixelated sprite the player wants to run around as, just like any other 'cozy' sim game. 

It also honestly makes me sad how few female characters there are at all, main character or not. There are witches, lots of whom are being burned at the stake every week, a wife who can only speak to you to teach you how to cook, and a singer who's entire personality is to be promiscuous. 
""Oh, but, but, strong women (or normal regular women, even) wouldn't be accurate in a medieval simulation game!""
It is literally supposed to be 'the most inaccurate medieval cemetery sim' and there is a talking donkey. A woman being normal is not going to break the atmosphere of the game. 

Another major con I have is that the NPC's in general are lacking any real depth, It feels like they really only exist to give you items and quests. Every conversation feels surface level, and there isn't a clear way to make friends or bond with people. They're just lacking the personality it takes to get attached to any of them. The only one I really want to be friends with or feel 'attached' to is Snake, and it's because I actually got to see a little glimpse of character development. 

Overall, this game has an unbelievable amount of potential, but until there's a clear understanding of basic game mechanics, any real *kind* female representation, character customization, and some genuine way to interact with the NPC's, I can't in good conscience recommend this to anyone. I truly hope the devs of this game consider adding at least a few of these things, I've seen countless threads of people who have been asking for years to play as a woman, and I can't wrap my head around why nobody wants to implement that possibility.",1705479911,1705479911,False,2,0,0.496551752090454102,0,True,False,False

My advise: watch a bit of a gameplay video if you're not sure if this is for you. There's a lot to craft, bring stuff back and forth and a crazy amount of dialog to wade through. It took me over 100 hours to get everything the game had to offer.

I've quit playing - might try and finish it later but I am burned out on grind. I'll keep the below mostly spoiler free in terms of story, but discussion of some items you can get or high-level tasks is necessary for detail.

Examples of wasting my time - Each important NPC is only available on their day of the week and they will give you quests to talk to the other NPCs. You will get a quest to talk to someone who was there yesterday, meaning you have to wait a whole week. They will give you a quest that asks you to talk to someone who was there two days ago. It's annoying and extremely frustrating. There is a stone garden you can build later to literally sit and ""sleep"" though the week but you still have to sit there and do nothing for like 4 minutes (game will pause if it loses focus).

POIs are spaced very far apart. You will get expansions to your homestead but walking between them is arduous. Just walking up to the apiary probably takes one minute for not much benefit. You can get a teleport stone which lets you teleport between your house and major locations and speed potions which increase your move speed. I would recommend you get both ASAP as they will save you hours of your life. 

There is a huge timegate for the aristocrat papers. The game wants you to farm 12g by selling crates of vegetables or steel or whatever, and it takes a long time to grow the vegetables. A vegetable plot takes something like 25 min real-life time to grow, you need probably 5 plots per crate, and it sells for 10-15 silver. I started working on this but it's not fun, used cheat engine to give myself the money (FYI money is stored as floating point with silver as base, e.g. 2g 15s 32c = 215.32), and was still unhappy about it.

The items and economy seem incomplete. After the start of the game you will have so much food that you can't really sell and just eat to power though everything. The game will inflict a debuff on you which drains your energy after several days of not sleeping, but you can just continue eating. There are also many items which are effectively useless and don't sell for much if anything at all. E.g. Booze/Alcohol is the top tier brewing tech which requires a significant investment. Booze's only use is to break down into alcohol, which sells for single digit copper and is used for like two unimportant alchemy recipes.

I liked the theme of this game. I liked discovering what manipulating bodies did and thought manually discovering alchemy recipes was fun although I wish there were clues in the world about the recipes (unless I missed them). Building and decorating the church was enjoyable. I just felt like every time I wanted to progress the story the game spat in my face and I'm not really ""discovering"" anything new anymore.

The dialogue and NPC's are funny and amusing! Some of story-lines are sweet and heartwarming and its interesting learning the backstories of the different characters. 

It is VERY important to note that the DLC's are meant to be played at the same time as the main story line. And watching through the credits does not provide any additional story but will put you back to the last save so make sure to save right before you finish if you want to do the DLC after the main story. Some choices that you make in the main story will block you from certain options in the DLC so just be prepared for that. There is alternatives though which is great that the devs provided that.

All the DLC was pretty fun and interesting to play through, although the one with Euric feels like it ended way sooner than it should have and there is alot of questions left over.

Main game wise there are some mechanics, like having to go home to save, the fact that Golden Apples are useless after the one mission, and that if you are even a smidge off in your timing that you can't interact with NPC's that can be a little annoying at times. Each day is about 9 minutes long so you really have to plan around that. Also the tracking is off on some of the achievements so you will have to over on them to get them.

Overall a pretty fun and chill game! Definitely recommend it if you want something with dark humour (its a grave keeping game), interesting NPC's, make your own zombies, Gerry, and both farming and fishing. Also, the autopsies aren't graphic (and the organs are mostly anatomically correct).

The game is slow, not like how Stardew or other games are slow where you can take your time but there's a deep world to explore and plenty of little things to do to busy yourself, this game is just a slow grind with a poor energy system.
The energy system is far too small for the amount of work you need to do in any given time-frame and but by mid-game it doesn't matter much because you have ready access to more food than you'll ever know what to do with. With that being said, the devs thought of this and because you technically never have to sleep in this game (Except to save or witness certain storyline events) they put in a debuff that makes your energy slowly go down to half after you've expended a certain amount of energy since your last rest. It's like the equivalent to three or five energy bars, which sounds like a lot, but I can empty that much before noon of a day starting at dawn. Combine this with the fact that the game heavily relies on its storytelling through characters that only appear once a week and you'll see the issue, but this brings me to my next point.

The storytelling is done through NPC interactions and the player as the player is given various tasks that gradually fill a bar that I believe is meant to demonstrate how much they like you but it's really a bar that tells you how close you are to being done interacting with that person. Now, all of this is fine and good and would work except for the fact that pretty much all of the characters (if not all) need you to do something with other characters via telling you to fetch something from them to continue their storyline. This forces you to do the story for everyone in a really janky and frustrating way because, again, most of these characters are only present for one day of the in-game week. This is fine until you get to a certain point with some stories that require you to do things for different people on opposite ends of the week. This leads to you meditating, which is the game's way of skipping time in a far too slow manner, which also doesn't save the game, even though it's acceptable as a form of resting. Want to know how I know it doesn't save the game? Because my game has crashed twice, and I lost about half an hour of progress each time. This brings me to my next point.

This game has bugs, which I honestly didn't expect because I didn't figure there was a lot under the hood to go wrong here. As I said though, it's crashed twice, I've had items that were magnetizing into me fly off into space, My UI has shrunk randomly on launch every now and again, and a some other things! Dialogue has also had issues where it continues but I'm no longer locked into place until I have to make a choice, thankfully I didn't walk off-screen when that happened though since I'm sure that would've soft-locked me.

Other than the previously mentioned, there are a lot of little things I have issues with. 

At the start of the game, you do a couple of quests and then all of the DLC activates, giving you and unreasonable amount of stuff to do, and also breaking the early-game economy if you progress in any of it a little. You then forget half of all of this because there's so many things to do and have to navigate through a gigantic list of people that you've met. Most of them are not quest-givers or at least have been involved in any quests I've done, and I'm pretty far in from what I can tell.

There's an automation system but it's painfully slow and needs to be micromanaged for anything other than gathering logs and stone.

Being a graveyard keeper is the least interesting part of this game and quickly becomes a chore. That's not to say any other part of this game is particularly interesting, because I spent my time playing assuring myself I'd be having fun the next hour. Progression is a crawl and you have a movement speed to match but that can be remedied through speed potions (Which last for 10 minutes and further dissuade you from sleeping).

You can't get rid of any of your tools, which forces you to store or figure out how to sell your old tools which you will upgrade twice, resulting in roughly 12 items you have to deal with. Add this along with quest items that persist after their use but can't be destroyed or sold and you've got a burden on your extremely limited storage as items either don't stack or don't stack to high enough numbers. You also only have 25 inventory slots, which needs to be doubled before it's acceptable.

There are three kinds of XP, red points come from labor, green points come from nature, and blue points come from very hyper-specific actions while also being required for all of the worthwhile skills. You get them from either studying, which is a one-time thing, or making high-tier items for your graveyard. It should be noted that things made through the automation system don't give XP.

Mild spoilers but the game does give you a sword and armor so it's not that big of a shock. There's a dungeon that I have several issues with. The first issue is that you have to clear the floor you're on before you can progress to the next floor, even if the way down is in the middle of the level or this requires you to navigate it's maze-like architecture to go to some distant tiny room you missed something in. My next issue is that the combat is stiff and unrewarding and the devs though ""difficulty"" meant ""more enemies"". This is fine though because there's no penalty for dying at any point, in fact the game rewards you for dying by bringing you to your bed, healing you, and even some steam achievements require you to die multiple times.

There's basically no customization, you can choose where furniture goes within constructed templates and one of the DLCs lets you put like a rug and some wallpaper in your house.

Other than this, the characters have stories, but none are particularly interesting, mostly because it's a series of gathering things for said characters and little else, meaning there's little connection to any of them.

I'll end off by saying that I'll likely finish the game, after all I've dumped a day and a half in it, and it doesn't seem I'm far off now. I also feel like I should say at least one nice thing about the game before ending the review. If you've exhausted stardew or otherwise want a relaxed game to turn your brain off to, it wouldn't be a terrible choice. Also I like Gerry.

Edit: I thought of one other thing I like. The music is quite nice except I wish the loop was a little longer.

5/10

Pros:
+The art and characters are solid
+The overall story (what little there is) is fine.  It's there, but you only get like a bite an hour at most.
+The ""Core"" of the game is fine.

Cons:
-Every step to progress your tech requires a lot of steps. I mean a LOT.  It's convoluted.
eg: I wanted to make notes so I could get ""Science Points"".  Ok, I need ink and paper. Sounds easy.
1) Make Glass (Can't even gather sand until you trigger an NPC on a specific day)
2) Make Upgraded Furnace (Did you have grind the points to unlock?)
3) Did you unlock glassblowing (Points!)
4) Did you unlock graphite (Points!)
5) Did you build a Mill-Workbench AND Alchemy Mixing Workbench (Points!)?
5a) This requires advanced stonecutting (POINTS!)
5b) Oh, also advanced Glassblowing (YEP!)

-Where and what is build in specific places is overly restrictive.
-NPCs are generally very shallow
-Despite the sandbox game nature of this genre, this is not a sandbox game.  It almost feels like a mobile game.
------------

When compared to other games of similar genre, like Stardew Valley, this game is good for it's depth.  Unfortunately, there just isn't a really intuitive way to play, or things to really do other than grind while waiting for things to be made.  In other games, you might decorate your farm/house/etc.  There should be many minor loops to fill downtime, or MUCH more direction, OR MUCH LESS WORKBENCHES scattered everywhere.

If you like a very slow, very plodding experience with a lot of ""What am I supposed to be doing...?"" this might be for you.  If you're more of a sandbox-type player, this ain't it.

For the base game, I really love the art style and mechanics of preparing the cadavers and maintaining the graveyard. The various characters you meet in order to accomplish your mission are interesting, and funny at many times. Many of the goals for each person does revolve around getting further into the skill tree and creating the more complex items.

Advice: Always extract Blood, Fat, and Bones from your cadavers (they will only improve the bodies). Extract at least 25 skulls (you'll thank me later)

Overall, I would actually buy all DLCs for the game, since they meld and assist with the base game needs pretty well. Better Save Soul's story does end very obruptly so you may find it less satisfying, but the new mechanics with the soul extractor still makes it a worthwhile purchase. The other two I see very little flaws in. Stranger Sin's story is a 10/10, and the new mechanic of running a tavern is also very well done. Game of Crones, the mechanics of having the refugee camp is a little unclear of its utility, but it does make up for with a decent story.",1704936399,1704936399,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I just finished the base game, and decided to start writing this review to give both sides credit where due.

[h1] POSITIVES [/h1]

[list]
    [*]Communist Donkey and a talking skull, I already like these two characters.
    [*]The game has great pixel art, and looks great as a result
    [*]A very calming soundtraack and nice adaptive music that changes subtly around certain NPCs
    [*]The farming/resource management is nice enough to keep me engaged with the need to constantly seek out needed materials
    [*]Good customizable workspaces. Your workspaces will normally allow you to place the many types of workbenches you need in whatever way you want, which allows a nice sense of space management.
    [*]No sprint required, if you can save up enough, you can get a teleportation stone which allows you to easily port to certain locations easily, coming with a cooldown though.
[/list]

Now unfortunately, this part has more than the positives, not for engagement, but generally stuff that I had major issues with.

[h1] NEGATIVES [/h1]
[list]
    [*]The game can be extremely sloggish at times, having to run from one area to another to make one specific item you need to craft at another workbench that you have to run back to.
    [*]NPC quests are annoyingly intertwined at times, in order to keep the story moving, you must complete another NPCs needs. If you can't meet said needs by the same day to move on to the next step with another NPC, you'll have to wait a week, and you can't skip days easily.
    [*]The energy system is nice, but can get annoying easily. You need to carry food with you constantly in order to get a lot done, as certain workbenches like the anvil will drain your energy bar fast.
    [*]There are so many workbenches, and some require a 2nd tier upgrade to make certain items. This is something I'm usually fine with, but when you upgrade said workbench, there are items you cannot craft anymore due to the workbench gaining a 3rd slot that needs to be used. Having so many workbenches just creates confusion and is slightly frustrating, especially since it requires you to run back and forth constantly in order to figure out if you're using the right workbench, or if you're in the wrong place at the wrong bench.
    [*]In the fighting portions of the game, there is little to no hit stun for your character after being attacked. Enemies in the dungeon can quickly pile on and kill your character quickly. I myself never died in the dungeon due to this, but I can see frustration with this. 
[/list]

Now lets get to my biggest issue with this game. [b] The numerous DLCs. [/b]

I get that every developer has to eat, pay rent, and the like, you have to make a profit somehow. But making a base game that costs $20, only to have future updates/content additions be locked behind $10 paywalls is ridiculous to me. To enjoy the full experience of all content from this game (excluding soundtrack and artbook purchases), you would have to pay $50 in total, for more resource gathering and more workbenches to tediously run around for. There's even a skill (Industriousness) you can only get from the DLCs that appears in the base game, but it doesn't tell you that it requires the DLCs to be obtained. 

This is where I get into spoilers slightly so I'll put a spoiler text for those who would rather avoid that.

As I said at the beginning of this review, I JUST FINISHED THIS GAME TODAY (1/7/2024). I have been playing this game on-and-off for 50 hours because of the tedious nature of this game. It made me constantly want to stop playing after I'd hit a roadblock as to what to do next, causing me to need to visit the fan wiki. I finally got all the resources I needed to finally push my way through to the end of the game, [spoiler] only to be met with a tease for ""no zombie apocalypse? No invasion from the north? No seeing The Town? No sailing with the Merchant? I'm disappointed"" and then what felt like a cheeky poke to buy DLCs for more content. From the Donkey no less! [/spoiler]. This... honestly didn't feel funny to me at all, and that might just be me, but this joke just didn't land. All my work, only to be told to buy future DLCs (which have been out for several years at this point). Really just rubbed me the wrong way, and idk if I'm going to recommend this game to my friends now.

TLDR; 

Fun at first, gets tedious fast. Too many workbenches for my liking. Ending was very lacking. All DLCs for more content cost half the base price of the normal game in order for more gameplay. 

Overall: 3/5 for base game, you either like it or you get tired of it quickly.

The game's unique premise of managing a medieval graveyard is surprisingly engaging and offers a refreshing change of pace from typical simulation games.

One of the standout features of Graveyard Keeper is its depth and complexity. The game offers a wide range of activities to keep players engaged, from tending to the graveyard and performing autopsies to farming, crafting, and trading. The game's progression system is well-balanced, providing a sense of accomplishment as players unlock new abilities and expand their graveyard.

The game's dark humor and quirky characters add to its charm, making it a joy to explore the game world and interact with its inhabitants. The pixel art style is visually appealing and adds to the game's overall atmosphere.

The game also offers a great deal of replay value, with multiple endings and a variety of side quests to complete. The developers have also released several updates and expansions, adding even more content to an already extensive game.

Overall, Graveyard Keeper is a must-play for fans of simulation and management games. Its engaging gameplay, depth, and humor make it a standout title in the genre.

No, I would not recommend this. 

I am not a fan of not being able to save when I want. The game can only save when you get out of bed, and you can't always enter the bed. 

There is also no quest log. Good luck knowing what to do, or where the yellow arrow is leading you! 

Nothing of value is explained to you. During my first 30 minutes of playing, the game severely info-dumps on you, yet I had to search how to do 14 different things. I wish I was kidding. 

Any task you are given at the start, REQUIRES mid-late game research. I did not get to complete a single task, all because every quest/job is basically this: 

1. Build this (x). 
2. You cannot build this (x), you need blueprint. 
3. You got blueprint, now you need hammer.
4. Hammer is near church and not explained to you. Good luck finding it! 
5. You found a hammer! Do you have license to hold the hammer handle? 
6. Get license to hold hammer handle at Mayor of ""Imake-Badgames"". 
7. Mayor will only give you license if you build this (x), leaving you confused until you google it.

The game gives you really bad instructions, honestly I dont know where it went wrong but I just got like two tutorial windows teaching me the basic stuff I'd already been doing for 5 hours. Like what, how did I miss this?? 

Oh, and the quest menu is wack, as there isn't one. You have to check out the list of NPC's and in there you can see quests related to them.

Will try out a DLC in hopes that the main focus - the church and graveyard - are a bit further expanded upon. I expected to have a full graveyard and a maxed out church before I got to the end credits. 

My personal take on pros and cons - pros:
The game is simplified in the right places and almost all 'grindy' things have their option of getting automated with zombies.
I very much like the decision to have the gardening sort of ""glossed over"" and simplified, because Stardew Valley already exists and does that aspect better. The Dungeon delving is also better than Stardew.

cons:
Alchemy, where you blindly end up mixing 3 ingredients (mostly without results) is just not fun. You can buy recipes from the witch, but they stop at a certain point.
Unlocking anything in the tech tree is too abrupt. The creators should had bound that as an activity to the study table.",1704198504,1704198504,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are many things in the game that are confusing like how to make money. The game encourages you to upgrade your crops and grapes and hops to gold star but, at some point i was making a ton of gold beer and no where to sell it?? You have to have the DLC to sell some of the things the game is asking you to do. The Bronze crops you start with are useless because you cannot sell them. They are also annoying to cook since you can only do one at a time. I couldnt progress through the mine and it kept asking me to talk to a NPC who never mentioned anything im guessing in need a DLC to access that as well.

I would not use this game as a means to torture my worst adversaries.  I would only force this jumbled pile of code on the devs for all eternity.  I want to acknowledge the good, but for each good point there are several varying points that erode away anything resembling a good thought or idea.  The amount of bugs from trivial and nuisance all the way to game breaking are at first unbelievable, but when I came to the realization of what kind of dev team made this it made more sense.  At first the base game comes across like an unfinished early access where the devs start to feel the burnout creeping in. And so they moved onto a few DLCs hoping to reignite the passion that was so clearly evident at the start to only run into the dreaded burnout again.  Getting worse with each DLC.  I feared that some of the issues were from laziness or not enough time, but when all is taken into consideration it does not seem to be correct and the only real explanation is that the devs are terrible people and that no one should give these people any money nor waste any of their time on this game.  I would only agree that someone should play this game if they received this for free.

TL;DR: Nice game but due to lack of content, far too grindy, but all in all, entertaining if you are OK with that]


It's a kinda nice game, borderline entertaining, and I'll likely keep playing it, but mind the following, for which I can't wholeheartedly recommend and I think one should think twice to purchase or not, especially anywhere under -75% promo:

[list]
    [*] You'll walk your leg off. Long, BORING, brainless walks left and right over and over again, all on a small area so even no variety
    [*] The whole game is a grind fest. Very few things to do but in large numbers (autopsy, collecting mats, crafting the same few stuff in huge numbers and only 1-1 of other things like a workbench, then forget it's even craftable, not needed anymore), as well as corpses come far too often and one has to deal with them...
    [*] I'm quite sure the grindfest nature is due to lack of content. There's a number of ?quests?, a story to progress with, but there are only a few of those ""key points"" and a long way (grind) to get there; means, you get a quest in the first minute, and grind for a good 10 hours to finally get to the point being able to progress with it (later on this changes: everything can be done spot-on, except the ones have to be googled as no other way to find out wtf to do, see below)
    [*] NOTHING is explained or hinted, so one either googles it, or keeps walking the legs off in hope finds solution to problems (where to find a particular item, how to grind stuff to unlock other stuff - especially blue points in early game, wtf is a btw good for nothing ""keeper's key"" at all, where to find salt (found out after 40-ish hours, of which 35-ish was grinding), etc.)
[/list]

Funny thing is, I unlocked almost everything in the tech. tree - guess what, it's all about grinding, but still couldn't get a ""meat stamp"" via the (googled) Snake quest chain as it's far, faaar away, or craft a key for him (as it had to be googled in the end) - both things I received as a task early in the game, not mentioning flyers, pen & ink, etc., all these received very early in the game, impossible to achieve before 10-20 hours of grinding.
So... I unlocked stuff by grinding my arse off, and now it seems finally I can craft everything, but corpses keep coming, my GY will get full soon so I guess the grinding will start over...
(45+ hours update here: just let the corpses rot... ignore them, when the morgue is full, they stop coming, and you'll have to grind your arse off and exhume every single corpse anyway to upgrade the graveyard, so even better not bothering with the dead, for at least 45 hours. Extract parts for mats and that's it)



To sum it up, what I'm saying is, this game could have been a nice, slow-pace, story driven & exploration something, but the studio went cheap and decided to make a small map, very few undoable quests, everything with zero help or explanation (quest log, journal, etc), so time is wasted on grinding and repeating the same thing over and over again.
See my opening sentence - if discounted, go for it but if you find it too grindy, refund before your 2 hrs window expired (I wish it had an at least 3-5 hours play time demo!).",1700596985,1703864701,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

What I like:
- graphics & artstyle
- story idea
- Bought it for ~3,90€ and its definitely worth its price

What I don't like:
- Minimum amount of tutorials is generally fine with me BUT I had to google a lot (e.g. how to put stuff into your quickslots, how/where can I build certain stuff that is not described in their discription etc.)
- Everything feels overwhelming at the beginning which can cause players to give up early. Would have been better if more stuff is introduced a bit more slowly like step by step
- Seemingly no character design options and WHY THE HELL DOES MY ARMOR NOT SHOW ON MY CHARACTER?!
- Feels like you have to take certain tech paths to progress even though you don't necessarily want to

My recommendations:
- Add more character design options, at least show the stuff that you wear
- It should be possible to put the teleport stone into quickslots
- Add rideable horses & a workhorse with a carriage

This game is not utterly terrible, but I can't call it good either. I wish there was neutral opinion, but there isn't so I'm going with negative. I've spent in GK over 70h to give it fair review. I wanted to finish it, but one day I just understood I can't play this anymore and I stopped. I watched the ending on Youtube, and it only showed that I didn't lose anything.

Pros:
- charming pixel graphics
- no time pressure
- a lot things to do 
- game doesn't treat you like a toddler
- interesting technology trees

Cons:

1. Grind, grind, grind.
For 6h you have great fun. After 7h you still feel some fun, but start to notice there is something wrong. After 20h game becomes a chore. I expected to be a Graveyard Keeper, but ended up as Grind Master instead. You want to tend your graveyard? Forget it. 

Note: [spoiler] Donkey will stop brining you bodies for free if you unlock the church. Afterwards he will demand carrots as payment. Already it's not enough graveyardkeeping, yet after this it's even less. [/spoiler] 

I don't mind grind if amount of it is reasonable. Look at Don't Starve. There is grind and gathering resources, but it's balanced well and in a meantime random things appear to kill  the monotony (and you). Another one - Rimworld. Same basics + more random things happen in the meantime. In GK it's way too much grind and not enough action. It lacks random events that could make the experience  more exciting and fun. All you do is work. This game was literally making me tired.

2. Town.
I had no idea Town was supposed to be in the game, so I'm not salty about it. There is something else, that I'm salty. There was an info, the Town is not aviable in the Alpha. Automatically you think: ""Oh ok, this means it's going to be in a full released version. Cool."" But Town is not there. Developers LIED. It's  LYING I'm salty about. They could just say: ""There will be Town DLC in the future."" And it would be really OK. To defend themselves they said it was a joke... WOW. HILARIOUS. They suck as comedians, but certainly know how to shoot themselves in the foot.

3. Alchemy.
Without Wiki don't even try it. 

4. No transporation.
Your character is slow and there is nothing to do about it except a potion, but... is it really worth it?

5. NPC's and plot.
When you remove whole grind, you can clearly see how short this game is in terms of story and lore. Many opportiunities were wasted, like [spoiler]cursed half of graveyard. When you unlock it, nothing happenes so it wasn't cursed at all.[/spoiler]. NPC's are uninteresting. Inquisitor is kinda funny. Donkey would do greatly as fertilizer for my crops.

6. Dungeons/ Combat system.
Fight is unpleasant and poorly executed. If you finish a dungeon, you don't have to do it again. Too bad you can't sell armors and swords (and tools).

7. No moral dilemmas.
Except removing body parts for personal benefit or dumping body into the river there is none. Although... I don't feel like I'm doing something wrong. Speaking in metaphor: Body parts are like ingredients in a  recipe. If I need ""flour""to ""bake a cake"", I'm getting it. If  I need a heart, I'm getting it. If the corpse gets ugly because of it, I'm throwing it away, because it's garbage. That's all. 

8. No conequences.
You throw a body into the river - no one knows, no one cares. You pick the most ridiculous answer for NPC's questions, they just think you are funny or weird. Selling human flesh as food has no repercussions. Dumping corpses at Inn's door or Inquisitor's feet does nothing. It just makes no sense.

9. No rewards nor sense of progress 
Finishing quests means reward. Every NPC has ""Bring me x somethings"". It's OK, but you gain NOTHING in return. [spoiler] There is a quest to fetch Gerry a bottle of wine. You give it to him and NOTHING happens. [/spoiler] What was the point? To waste my time or money even more? Thanks, you nailed it.

You work like a slave and even if you managed to finally create something significant, you still feel like you didn't make any progress at all. 

10. Ending.
Punch in the gut + the look on your face when you realize how much time you wasted = Priceless.

11. Bugs
There is some bugs, game stutters. I had annoying bug, where I was making Freshner for fertilizers. I had ingredients to make 10 flasks, but made 3, because it bugged, and I've lost tons of components... I was OVERJOYED.

12. Soundtracks
Music is nice, but you have to listen to ONE soundtrack. Yes, it is pretty, but over 30h it starts to annoy you. There should be more sounds. Like birds, insects, wind... You know... sounds of the wilderness, to make it more lively. Everything feels like barren wasteland. There is flora, but where is fauna? What happened to animals? They died too?

People compare this to Stardew Valley. Graveyard Keeper is NOTHING like Stardew Valley, and thank heavens  for that, because I never wanted it to be like it. Stardew Valley was made by ONE GUY, and it received all love from it's creator. GK is like a child raised without love and care. 

GK has big potential, but I can't recommend this in it's current state. It's not terrible, but it's unfinished and lacks pure fun. Some people may enjoy excess grind. It's OK, but I'm not. As an adult  with full time job, and other responsibilities I just can't leave positive review. Time is precious, and this game doesn't respect it at all.

- It's basically grinding simulator.
- doesn't do good job on the premise.
- Has only one ost for working around, so it gets annoying quickly.

The premise of farming simulator but with bodies sounds good at first before you realize that you have been playing grinding simulator. I have come to this when my save got corrupted and I attempted to try again. Most of the progress is through fetch quests. Bring blood buckets to this guy so he will give you this item, to which you need to bring it to this person. Its very streamlined that you don't have almost none choice on which quests to complete first + you don't even have a quest journal and the way how they note to whom you bring which they decided to put it onto npc list which is very unintuitive.

If the fetch quests wouldn't be enough they have introduced days system. Each day something else happend and if you are waiting for a certain person and you miss them well sucks to be you, wait another week to do it.

Not only are the npcs time limited but also resource that is KEY ELEMENT to very important things. Faith you collect every sunday, you get very little faith and upgrading your church is pain in the ass as you need to fix your graveyard, make enough church prestige AND make favors to the bishop.

Again that wouldn't be as much of a problem if studying items that needs faith, that you have limited ammount because you need to wait every week to make a ceremony, gives you blue points that there are almost none ways how to aquire other than very grinding way of making gravestones you don't need or slow process of making glass aparature that you have thousands of green points and red points but can't spend them at all because you are low on blue points.

Well then I will just fix the graveyard no?
Well sucks to be you, because lots of the technology for better gravestones and such is locked behind the blue points gate and even when you have the top tier decoration you need to have very high prestige body.

You get that by trial and error of removing parts that have the rng to have the bad skull or good skull. That sounds pretty great if they wouldn't implement another RNG being the surgeon mistake. I hate trying to prepare the bodies trying to get the high ammount of skulls just to find out there was surgeon mistake and all my efforts to make high value body is damaged by this annoying part. Yes there are skills to reduce the chance but it never is 0.

It is also very ridiculous how there is no crafting recipe. Not for alchemy not even for the resources needed across the maps. It sounds like no big deal, but imagine travelling half the map just to find out you forgot some resource that you need to fix the darn thing. Better have notebook ready when you play this game.

And when you have notebook ready what if you would pull up a wikipedia so you can actually figure out how to craft certain items and WHERE. There are so many working stations that I spend lots of time waltzing around and opening the crafting menu's just to find and figure out where the hell do I craft the thing I just researched only to find out I need another working station. If not that some working stations can be created only in certain places which makes it even more frustrating because your main character is already pretty sluggish.

If you like to suffer while you listen to one music on loop over and over again, that is the only time I would recommend you this game.

Otherwise just don't buy this game.",1703116014,1703674358,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Starting off I was VERY frustrated, because the game does no hand holding at all. It wasn't until I read one persons comment that I actually stopped being frustrated.
Your character knows nothing. They are dropped into a medieval like setting and have no clue what is going on. So your discovery of things is effectively the character having to figure things out themselves. I have a love/hate still for the concept, but it no longer impacts my enjoyment of the game.

1. One thing I do like is there is no rush to things. There's no time limit/period to complete a quest. Get to it when you get to it.
2. There's no seasons, so no needing to stress about only having X number of days left to grow whatever crops.
3. I actually like that there isn't a traditional system for befriending the NPC's. No talking. No daily gifting. The needed friend points will be earned from story quests (you may get a tad stumped if you haven't played previously before the DLC is implemented. I strongly encourage main story is played prior to fully embracing the vampire [refugees are fine and very helpful earlier on] and tavern quest lines from DLC due to spoilers).
4. You can technically beat this game rather quickly. I'm a completionist, so I really enjoy unlocking everything on the talent trees, discovering all the alchemy recipes, perfecting the graveyard, etc. If you like stardew valley or SoS games, you might enjoy this. If you like crafting games, you're more likely to enjoy the game.

There are some things that do bother me. 
1. I know for a number of people the lack of saving (outside of sleeping) can be frustrating. 
2. I hate fishing minigames, so it's one of the things I haven't completed yet (achievements).
3. For most things, you are able to make multiple items. Some things do not allow you to pre-program the crafting tables/maker to make multiples. I don't understand why that choice was made at times.
4. I wish the teleport stone had a few more options, or we had the choice of picking our own hot spots (giving a limit of 7 places and letting us pick what we prefer based on needs, etc. I would really like a port to the morgue or church).

The idea of managing a graveyard, after all, doesn't exactly scream ""fun."" But I'm so glad I decided to give it a try, because Graveyard Keeper turned out to be a surprisingly delightful surprise.

The game's darkly comedic tone immediately hooked me. The characters are quirky and endearing, the writing is witty and often hilarious, and the overall atmosphere is a delightful blend of the macabre and the lighthearted.

The gameplay is also surprisingly deep and engaging. You'll not only be managing your graveyard, but also running a farm, mining for resources, and even experimenting with alchemy. There's always something to do, and the game never feels repetitive or grindy.

And the graphics are simply adorable. The pixelated art style is reminiscent of classic 16-bit RPGs, and the bright, cheerful colors provide a stark contrast to the game's morbid subject matter.

Overall, Graveyard Keeper is a charming, funny, and surprisingly addictive farming sim. If you're looking for a game that's a bit different from the usual, then I highly recommend giving it a try.

Strongest strengths:
The writing - it is funny, witty, and every character is endearing (except you adam.)
The pacing - Although wavering near the endgame, the pacing is what I liked most about GK. Planning every day to be the most effective - be it time-wise or just for getting the necessary steps to progress any given quest. Every time you get out of bed you think 'ok, this is the plan', and dash for the door. The hours will fly irl and suddenly you've played 6hrs.

Strongest flaw:
The skilltrees economy.
Half - and I do mean half - of the skilltree will be trivial by the endgame. Most quests will require you to unlock certain part of the skilltrees to progress, and therefore, use some of your precious blue science. In doing so, hoarding the blue science without grinding is easier said than done. Sure you can grind church related tasks but how dull is that?..  The sad thing though, if you do NOT grind and just play normally, the blue science will be scarce for 95% of your playtime, but will come in droves in the endgame, FINALLY allowing you to purchase some really nifty perks and abilities... which have now become useless since your cemetery is most likely all filled up by that point, or, you've got more than enough money anyways and so QoL perks aren't so necessary anymore.",1703213043,1703213043,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Edit: Be cautious when investing in this as it starts to get REALLY grindy around mid-game. They've introduced items that help a little bit, but at the end of the day its a lot of ""You need 20 of this item"" but that item requires a new crafting bench, which itself requires a material that requires another crafting bench \ skill. You end up spending a ton of time not really engaging with the story or customizing your play style but just kind slowly unlocking everything on every tech tree and grinding raw materials so you can slowly refine up the crafting ladders to make late-game items.

So I decided to get it at 75% discount and give it a try. But boy, the amount of disappointment was immense. Other than the decent retro style graphic and the calming music, everything else sucks.

To summarize, everything is unnecessarily complicated, which is:
i) a form of illusion to trick players into thinking the game has depth because the learning curve is steep; 
ii) a cheap tactic to make the game bloated by artificially lengthen the game time. 

To elaborate, this game somehow manages to compile every feature I hate/ despise about RPG and farming sims, and turn them into core gameplay:
- Skill tree is incredibly overwhelming. I almost had a seizure the first time I open the skill menu. Then when I realized that I was merely looking at 1/8 of the skill menu, I almost had a stroke.
- It doesn't stop there. Skill points are further divided into red, green and blue! Combine this with my first point, I felt like I need a master degree to grasp WTF is going on.
- Tons of different workbenches/ crafting tables. No one can f-king know which table crafts what sh!t without referring to the wiki. 
- Ooh it gets worse. Some crafting recipes are locked behind skill trees. The only way to find them is to either read through the overwhelming skill trees, or - google it.
- One dimensional and repetitive fetch quests. Go from point A, do something, then return to point B. Yeah sounds fun.
- Lack of quest logs. Unless you have photographic memory, the only way to remember WTF you are suppose to do is to go through all the trouble of speaking to the quest giving NPCs. People should stop trying to copy FromSoft games quest mechanics. 
- Lots of time wasting features. eg. Do something by pressing A > then hold Y > then press A again. Even sleeping requires you to wait for energy to full replenish. WTF? You might as well add in a nighttime urination feature, or better, a wet dream mini-game, if you want to simulate sleeping so badly. 

Conclusion:
- Games should be played and enjoyed without wiki. By googling every few minutes, not only the immersion is broken, you risk reading spoilers. 
- Unless you find joy in playing games with a Wiki opened next to you, don't get this game.",1702220615,1702220615,False,7,2,0.563409984111785889,0,True,False,False

It's great for those who like to farm and grind a lot to get materials, I especially like the personality and narrative of each characters. A few of my problems and dislike with the game is the confusing and all-over-the-place connected quests and requirements for a certain craftable item or trigger for the NPCs (Or maybe it's me that's the problem XD). Although exploring and trying things out to figure out how to get them is somewhat part of the charm of the game, I still think there should be more of a detailed quest info to get materials we need, something we need to require first before continuing on the quest, and many more, including either making a note taking system (To do list) or we could just do that irl (Which I do since there's just too much to do ^^"" and it's hard to keep track of them all). But other than that, I still recommend this game! :))",1702204534,1702204534,True,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Ultimately after reflecting, I realized this game left me disappointed at best and frustrated at worst.

[h1]Crafting[/h1]
Nothing is really explained how to craft anywhere. Whats worse: is you have like 30 workbenches to navigate between. The tech tree might show you what workbench an item is crafted at for some things but then theres no indication of where you can build workbenches at all (so youre going to each area to see 'can I build it here'). Some items are only obtainable by using alchemy, where some recipes are never shown to you. I get that this game is meant to be a 'discover on your own' but this game is unnecessarily convoluted in many ways so discovering some things is statistically unlikely to accidentally discover. Whats worse: some items you do discover you can craft are never shown to you again (i.e. such as the mixing table) so you better have something next to your computer to write it down! To make matters even worse still: some items are not craftable at all. I go through all of this to tell you that you spend a lot of time walking between workbenches completely frustrated, trying to figure out how to craft something, only to end up at google and figure out you cant craft it at all and must be bought from vendor A, and can only be bought after doing X, Y, and Z.

On a semi-related point, there is absolutely no f'in reason for there to be as many crafting benches in a game like this. I get that a hammer and a sandwich arent crafted from the same place but why does there need to be a distinction between types of wood working benches? This isnt a 10/10 realistic living simulator. Put it all in the same workbench like the super-retro-arcade-RPG that this is.

[h1]Vendors UI[/h1]
Same is true for vendors. You cant really see what vendors sell until you unlock their final level. Since some quests are locked behind some vendors, this can get old fast. Again, google becomes the game; clearly not the thing youre supposed to do but its the only way to figure out some of this stuff (in a reasonable amount of time).

[h1]Quests[/h1]
Quests are more of the same. There is no quest panel like in a normal RPG. Instead, the quest panel is merged with the NPC panel list. At best its not intuitive and at worst it absolutely doesnt work at all. So to jump straight to the 'worst', some quests are not directly associated with an NPC. Meaning some quests are completely invisible after theyve been assigned to you. So if you talk to an NPC right before youre shutting off your computer for the night and you werent paying close attention to what they said; you might play the game again in 3 or 4 days and not remember what the hell youre supposed to do. Again, google, and again, clearly no game is meant to be played through google; least of all a single player game.

Despite my best effort to try to immerse myself and enjoy the game via the narrative and trying to learn game mechanics organically through the same narration, I just couldnt. Some things are so poorly explained, some things are not explained at all, and some things you just end up forgetting about because there is no proper quest or proper crafting panel.

[h1]Items[/h1]
The reason to craft anything is: N/A. I spent the entire first 1/3rd of this game thinking 'this is like Stardew Valley with a graveyard'. It wasnt until later that I realized that this isnt even 1/3rd of the game Stardew Valley is; its a lame knockoff with a grungy aesthetic. Trying to immerse myself into the game organically (without google) and thinking this was SV, I tried optimizing my graveyard and home area for output. You realize real quick that there is absolutely no reason to grow or craft most of the things in the game. WHY EVEN HAVE IT IN THE GAME IF YOU CANT USE IT?

I didnt understand how the economy worked early in the game (avoiding google) so I grew a bunch of hemp because I thought I could sell the hemp and use the seeds for oil. Only to find out that you cant sell it or use hemp for anything but candles (worthless; only used for sermons but those are also pointless). Not to mention the economy of this game is absolute trash anyway so you end up with more money than you know what to do with and you can buy all the oil you ever need.

This isnt an isolated incident either. Lots of items in the game are like that. In fact, the kitchen workbench I practically never used outside of quests that forced me to use it. You end up having to google 'what can I sell, where and at what vendor level' because the game is needlessly uninformative to this end. In a normal RPG you just sell anything to anyone. I get in real life that I cant walk up to my car mechanic and sell him a tomato, but this is a f'in arcade game isnt it? Lets treat it that way.

But its worse. Some things you would expect vendors to buy; they just wont. Gold Beer you would expect to be sold at the tavern. The barkeep takes bronze and silver beer but will not buy gold beer. Something like Gold Wine can be sold in the base game (once a week) but to really make gold you find out you need the Stranger Sins DLC. UGH. Boring. Just let me sell it at the tavern where people drink. FFS.

[h1]Story[/h1]
Really, theres no reason to do anything at all outside of the story. And I mean that in the literal sense. This is a strong difference to other RPGs where there are other things to do outside of the story that are just fun to do or otherwise aide your progression of the story. This game has almost zero of that (except creating zombies and micromanaging the small amount of goods you can sell to vendors).

Theres even a dungeon (just like SV) but I found myself bored with it about 16 levels in and realized there was nothing to keep me going down there. So I stopped. My gameplay didnt change at all, nor would it have if I would have continued. Youre really only required to go to level 3 or 4 to craft an item you need for a quest.

Even in the credits that roll after a lackluster story and ending, they f'in joke about ""but we didnt [spoiler]go to the town[/spoiler] or [spoiler]see the ship[/spoiler]"", ""Ah the developers will just make a DLC to make people find out that stuff! Ha Ha!"" Are you f'in kidding me? So you consciously knew your story and game was bad and now youre making fun of your customers for falling for it? F'in attrocious.

[h1]Game Pace[/h1]
Wow its bad. Sometimes youre rushing around trying to do 15 things at once and sometimes youre sitting there with nothing really to do at all, waiting for 3 or 4 days to pass. It became apparent fast that the culprit is the day-cycle. Unlike other RPG games that have seasons, this game has days. You might imagine that allows you a faster interval around things to do during different periods but its far worse. Instead, there is such a limited amount of time you have to do X, Y and Z, maybe you only have enough time to get X in.

Some quests need you to deliver X on a day, so you wait for them in front of their house as the sun comes up to give it to them. Then they hit you right back with a 'give me Y' and you have to rush to get the materials, craft and bring it back before the sun goes down. Half the time I was missing something or didnt make Y before sunset so you have to wait a whole extra week for that day to come back to finish the delivery.

This whole mechanic just felt unnecessary and just made the pacing of the game way too fast at some times and way too slow at others.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
At the end of the day, I played the game a bit. And I thought I enjoyed it; but after reflecting on what I did in the game and why, I enjoyed it because I thought I was working towards something. When the game ended and I realized, ""Oh, that was it!?!?"", that's when I ended up realizing this game wasn't good; it's just a busy-work simulator masquerading as an RPG.",1702006407,1702009149,False,233,6,0.853376805782318115,8,True,False,False

I genuinely enjoyed this game to where I was writing notes to write a good review alongside playing it

the developer put out a patch of nearly 80mb that ADDS advertisements to it.

how stupid can you be?



EDIT below, 12/7/2023 , 2 years after this review was made.

the developer has changed the main menu ads to only be their other games being worked on. Okay, sure - I guess. To me this still comes off as a customer viewing that this is for sure an abandoned game at end of life and inorganic way of advertising your other games; because you can simply find out by other means, and by being interested in their products by this game being good.

Since a considerable time has passed, my memory on this game might as well be a review.
I liked it, but having now played other games since - this game has degraded mentally. None of the grinds I did needed to actually happen, and I realize they were simply there for playtime engagement that don't respect your time. 
Everything that can be sneaky to slurp more minutes away from you - is. The crafting isn't instant, it takes time. The quests take time to be assigned to you. The dungeon takes time to respawn monsters in it for you to clear again. The -Paid- 5$+ DLC is to help you play the game less, of course; and is horribly balanced - it feels like you're buying cheats, instead of content. 

The houses have terrible routing between, with no upgrades; because the shortcut you purchase is an additional 3 loading screens. It's a facade; you get there faster without it, in all use cases except 2 of the shortcuts. This is bad. If you don't play this game with a Factorio planning mindset but it's your movement and gathering, you're in for a bad time, with a lot of backtracking, and wasted time on these routes. I feel like this simply isn't enjoyable anymore as something to think about, in something that's a parallel to Stardew Valley nowadays.


Most NPCs are mean to you, actively tell you to leave -- somewhat acceptable given the story, except one who is nice to you. Ignorable at first, but then it's.. Why? and you think larger picture about your time and what you've been doing while in the game being meaningless, reiterated by the NPCs you encountered directly. Were the developers intending this? No idea.

There's even a NPC in it I remember that makes fun of you and their entire schtick and jokes towards the player is that every task they assign is pointless - quite literally changing the number of whatever item they required, because they felt like it.
In the immediate moment, it's funny, after playing the game, and realizing the created tediums as a design choice - I feel it's intentional, and insulting the player directly for playing the game still, knowing that it's story locked and you're required to complete it, they can be whatever stupid task and you're forced to do it. What a weird mindset to create and have your player think about.

The movement is a static integer of speed at all stages of the game as your only transportation method. Which I thought was a balancing choice to make the world feel worth traversing in, but that wears off and now you have ""angle your character and wait"" while you alt tab second monitor until hit destination. This isn't desirable.
It would be if the world had activity in it, but it doesn't. They try to explain this away with ingame lore, but we both know that's cop out; and that they're aware of this and want to disregard it as ""gameplay""; slop that they know, that you're still playing, will accept and tolerate. I come to this conclusion with their deliberate design choices I iterated above. Every flaw because of this narrative feels like it's an angle that was intentional. 

Underneath all this though, I did like this game, when I was blissfully unaware. You just have to mentally block out the rest and deal with what don't enjoy, somehow, and I did - because I was playing games to not think about other aspects of what was going on in real life at the time. Nowadays? Maybe play this game inbetween youtube videos or something as an idle game if you're really going to play it. 
Play it without the DLC, then at the ""end""; do the DLC content (cheats). That's the experience of the game that was experienced by everyone. It's an entirely different game of course if you just rush the DLC, which is available right at the start of course. You can pay them more money to play their game - you're still losing. The winning move is to not play this game and watch someone else on youtube play it if you're VERY curious ; but there really isn't anything here ; only a tempting premise and idea of a game.

Okay no but really this game is chill and great.

The intro is grindy a little, I recall being a bit annoyed at how much stuff I had to manually do on repeat, but that was quickly alleviated and it became just mega fun to navigate all of the stories and NPCs whilst things were going on back home I could check in on and fix around.

The NPC storylines were great, truly some funny and imaginitive writing and the DLC further adds to this.

I will say if you intend on getting the DLC, don't sleep on starting them like I did. They ""scale"" from the start of the game so sleeping on them only delays the inevitable NPC interactions you need to do.

When I saw there were three content updates, I decided I would get them and play again, as I recalled enjoying the game. I'm glad I played again, this is a really fun game. The game scratches that itch for me to complete tasks that aren't as boring as real life. And it doesn't bust your balls the same way that SDV does with the day night cycle. You want to work all night because you have energy left, fine. You want to sleep for 3 seconds to get just a little energy back, that's cool too. And eventually you get resources to keep your stamina going and you really don't sleep at all except to pass time.

And while there are a lot of tasks in SDV, SDV is much more open ended, much more focused on the farm. Graveyard keeper's tasks, while there are a million of them, are much more linear and a lot of them are tied into NPC quest chains, opening up new shop keeper items, or building the plethora of equipment you need to progress through the game. And it's really quite satisfying to do all of this.

The game could do a better job of explaining to you, well, a lot of things. Where things are built, how to use specific stations like the hand mixer or alchemy mill. Or all the details you need to know for a quest, ones that were said in dialogue but not captured in the log. Where to make something from a quest. Why you are making mayo at a church workbench. Thankfully the wiki is really helpful.

The music in this game is really great. It's simple and short loops, but really a great match for the tone of every location. Love the title music, and the refugee camp music is great too. The pixel art is really top notch. Some of the best. The overall graphical vibe is so nice, the colors, water effects, fire looks great, wind in the trees is impressive and subtle. Really well done. While not a huge deal, the dialogue is full of translation errors, mostly words that are similar.

As I closed in on the end of the game, I was working on getting some achievements for the DLC, and I realized how tiresome it was becoming, so I bailed on that goal and just finished the game. It felt too cumbersome to set up all of the automation. A great game, it was just wearing out it's welcome.

Since I played the game twice, it's hard to tell how long it took me. Probably around 60 hours if I had to guess.

-It's much more forgiving with time limits
-It has a lot more stuff to do, but the mechanics are not as fleshed out
-While I never used it for anything other than gathering basic resources, you eventually unlock the ability to automate almost anything, which is a godsend for this type of game
-No matter how slow you progress, every single action you take, no matter how small it is, will always get you one step closer to the end, giving you a sense of constant progression that I liked a lot.

There are two main negative aspects that I personally disliked and I would like to see reworked in the future:
-The tutorials are not clear enough, they don't explain much and give you a hard time understanding what exactly you should do from the start, you will eventually get it as you keep playing but more clarity from the start would be appreciated
-Mechanics and craftings based on RNG such as [spoiler] the spawning of dark organs and book/food crafting with different qualities [/spoiler] are not very fun and make for an unstatisfying gameplay loop, you can circumvent the problem by soft resetting w/o saving but I think that's not intended and doesn't really feel good + load times are a thing, I'd rather have the option to spend extra resources to guarantee a succesful craft

First off i think this game is more ""chill"" than Stardew, especially if you're trying to loosely min/max. 
In Stardew if you miss something you have to wait four seasons to try again...In this game you just have to wait 6 days.
Energy management is way more relaxed in this game, specifically easier to get energy back. Unlike Stardew I don't feel like I have plan every step and action I take to be as efficient as possible.

This game does have one down side: Game breaking bugs.. 
Now, I've NEVER had a single bug personally, but I have two friends who've have game braking bugs where they've had to make a new saves and start over..
Again, I've personally NEVER encountered this, I've had about 3 playthroughs, all flawless. Do Not let this stop you from buying!

My favorite part about this game is that; at no point did I feel like a task was too daunting.
Some games when you get to the mid game and you look at the tasks ahead it feels as though you're at the bottom of a mountain looking up...  I never felt that in this game. Everything you need to get to the end game is easily at reach and you don't need to be some crazy min/max pro speed runner on youtube to reach the end game.

I 100% recommend ALL DLC!! They all add great new content and mechanics to the game. Honestly don't bother buying the game without the DLC.

It's close to fantastic. Play it if you like Stardew Valley and don't have ADHD. Play it if you like walking sims and have ADHD. Buy Teleport stones. 

At a glance, this could be spun as a macabre Stardew Valley. There's a large overlap of features in it, such as fishing, health, stamina, mining, a dungeon, farming, etc. However, this game differentiates itself in a few ways: 
- A tech tree. A fairly large one at that. 
- Purpose areas. Certain parts of your home are designed for specific groups of things, like Alchemy, Building, Construction, etc.
- Helpers. You can get helpful NPCs that help you automatically run the stations. As long as you have materials in the zone, your helpers will work on recipes at stations. 
- NPCs with story-driven tasks.

It's on the cusp of being a fantastic game and despite having a decent time with it, there's some things that really drove me crazy in it. I'm recommending it because I like its direction, but some of it really needs refinement.

# Crafting
There's no way to bookmark recipes and while there's a ton of items in the game, I found myself going back and forth from my construction zone to the church or to the morgue or to the quarry because I either forgot 1 item or forgot I needed 8 instead of 6 nails. 

Material conversions or requirements are either really cheap or really steep and the balance really throws me off. I'm overflowing with Peat and Plant scraps. I haven't found a justifiable use to dispose of it fast enough but I can't seem to get enough Faith to do anything significant besides research. Later levels of research are also extremely steep.

# Travel
The world is huge and I enjoy that. It really stokes the RPG nostalgia for me. There's a ""fast travel"" kind of hub under your home that can take you between the Church, Village, House, Morgue (and others), which is really nice, but... the layout of this area feels like it was designed to be annoying to walk through. It only saves me about 5-10 seconds going from my house to the Church through the underground. It's faster to go to the Morgue from the Church than using the underground. Same From the House to the Morgue. All because of a weird L-bend between the Morgue and the Church basement.

This brings me to the second thing: No running. There's a speed potion that helps but they're not easily accessible until later in the game. This makes going from your house to the village (if you haven't unlocked the underground path) like a 5 minute round trip. In game, that's nearly a whole day.

# Combat, Quests, & User Experience
Combat is incomplete. There's some feedback in the experience that's missing, like there isn't a sound for monsters dying, sword hits, or damage. There aren't ranged weapons, dungeon utilities, or anything. It makes combat extremely hollow and the dungeon abysmally boring. It's a maze of small rooms with 2 or 3 enemies connected by really long corridors.

You can't see item descriptions during the shop screen before you buy. I didn't buy Teleport Stones until midway through the game because I assumed they'd only take me home and they were expensive early on.

There's this weird thing that happens when crafting things where the progress is 100% but you're 1 stamina short to complete it. This is really really annoying. If you've played the game, you know what I mean.

The NPCs and their quests are okay. There's definitely really long plateaus between them, though. I enjoy that the quests are visible from the menu, though. 

# Overall
Between all of the issues I had with the game, I spent probably more than half of my time in-game walking and re-walking extremely long paths between zones while missing construction materials. This a walking sim for people with any amount of ADHD. 

My suggestion for improvements: 
- Running (with stamina drain) to traverse the world.
- Save or bookmark crafting recipes.
- Change the underground layout to have shorter routes. If it's meant to be a hub, let it be a hub that makes sense.
- Craftable Teleport Stones, more Teleport Stone locations, and remove the cooldown.
- Max Stamina Buffs or Max Stamina improvements through the tech tree.
- Backpack upgrades for more slots.
- Finish the combat. It's clearly incomplete.
- Make the dungeon floors less... hall-y.
- Add ambient sounds, like waves near the ocean, wind in the forest, water near the river, bubbles in the swamp, etc.
- Add a jobs board or random side quests.
- Add Workshop Mod support.",1701653181,1701653181,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I remember seeing some youtuber play it a long time ago and really liking the concept, so when i saw a 100 day video on it from another creator, I decided to watch it, to see if it really was as good as i remembered, and it was. So I wishlisted the game and bought it once I had the money. Turns out, the game really wasn't actually that good.
First off, the game really doesn't have that much going if you already know the story, now, granted, that was kinda my fault for watching a video of the entire game, but even then, that also means that there's really no reason to replay it.
""Well then if it doesn't have much replay value I'll just keep playing on a single save file"" yeah there's not much interesting stuff to do after the main story.
""Well, this is a management game, I'll just optimize my game as much as possible and stop playing, not all games have to go on infinitely"" Yeah, no, that's also incredibly annoying. There's a community-made spreadsheet with the most optimized layouts for everything from all places you can build things at to how to create the highest rated corpse possible, it really helped me out during my playthrough. I didn't know where to say this but i feel it's very important to mention.
I kinda ruined my segue to the next point by mentioning the spreadsheet so from here on im just gonna change the review's structure and list my problems without trying so hard to... do everything look I'm not good with writing and I just also lost my writing flow
[list]
[*] Here’s an example of just how bad optimization can get: the maximum rating for the graveyard with all DLCs is 2488. The maximum rating per grave is 26. not including any other decor you need 80 graves for that, that is 80 corpses which need 1 of each of the 7 upgradeable body part upgraded to +3 white skulls, assuming that all variative organs are +3 whites by default so you don’t need to upgrade them, you’ll need 2880 sin shards. The maximum of sin shards you can get from a corpse is 15 if you have the double shards buff + let the healed soul decay into a shard. That means that, if you ignore the shards you need to max out the soul healer itself and to create the double shards buff prayer itself, if you started with no maxed out bodies, the donkey already unionized (so you need to give him 5 carrots per corpse + doesn’t deliver on sundays), got perfect RNG (so all corpses came with all 7 sins, allowing you to get max shards per corpse) and didn’t miss a single day, you’d need 192 to max out all 80 corpses for the graveyard, which would take 219-220 in-game days. None of this can be automated except maybe crafting the injections which I didn't mention before but are also an important part -wait nvm the injections themselves are crafted in the church workbench which doesn’t have an automatic counterpart. I was also gonna calculate the resources required to create all max tier gravestones & fences for the graveyard but I hope that I could get the point I’m trying to make across without it.
[*] The quality of the writing kinda went down towards the end of the base game. Or maybe I just didn’t notice it before then.
[*] The game has some things that you can’t put in your inventory, so you have to pick them up and carry them around, like logs, corpses, or ore chunks. One of the more accessible ways of getting green research points is by cutting trees. When cutting trees for green points, you’ll probably leave the logs on the ground instead of picking them up. This means that there’ll be a lot of logs on the ground. That lags the game a lot. There’s no way to automatically put logs on the ground into storage. My game did indeed start lagging a lot so I decided to set up automated log production until I no longer had any logs on the ground. By the end of the game, I still had logs scattered around the map.
[*] The ending automatically plays once you build both parts of the portal machine, so you have to have one of two sets of three quest items permanently in your inventory or stored somewhere.
[*] Finishing the game rewards you by making it so that the black bars on the top/bottom of the screen that appear when you’re in a cutscene are always there. This makes the game basically unplayable.
[*] Even though all other flashback cutscenes from the Stranger Sins DLC are rewatchable, the final one isn’t for some reason.
[*] There’s some other things but I think that I’ve written enough already.

The best rating to this game would be 'neutral' (when are you going to add this option, Steam??), so I'm giving it a negative review to push it towards neutrality. 

[h2]Truth is this game feels like something to speedrun.[/h2]
You unlock skills to build things that gives you more skill points to unlock more skills (x500). It doesn't have that feeling of ""I want that specific machine or object to do something"", like Stardew Valley has. The machines/objects/graves you unlock are simply updates of old ones. It simply doesn't feel like you're doing something new. It's TOO repetitive.

[h2]There's a graveyard[/h2]
You need to take care of the graveyard. The bodies can be trown at the river or burned down. But for progressing the main storyline, you need to build nice looking graves and bury people. The graveyard has a rating based on that. 

[h2]The customization is almost nonexistent.[/h2]
You can't even change clothes, let alone the character's appearance. The space you have to place graves/machines is EXTREMELY LIMITED by small grids. 

[h2]The main storyline... exists.[/h2]
It's not good, it's not that bad. It's just there.

[h2]Loading bars everywhere.[/h2]
The game seems like a loading bar challenge. Not because it is actually loading something, but because for every action you take, there's an action bar filling up that you need to wait for. Also every action depletes your energy bar, and you need to go to bed to fill it up again. And theres that: WHY DO WE HAVE TO WATCH THE CHARACTER SLEEPING WHILE THE BAR FILLS UP? WHY NOT SIMPLY SKIP TO WHEN HE WAKES UP? 
So basically you run to workplace, wait for action bars, when your energy bar is empty you run home to sleep and fill it up, so you can run back to your workplace and wait for the action bars, and repeat that hundreds of times. 

[h2]Nothing like Stardew Valley[/h2]
I know this may seem a bit out of context, but I see a lot of reviews comparing both. They have nothing in common. In Graveyard Keeper the customization is close to nothing, there is no relationships (of any kind) with other villagers. You can grow some crops, but you don't even need to water them.

I've been hyping it up in my head for so many months, just waiting for the price to drop during a Steam sale to a low enough number that I would feel comfortable buying it at, and it happened. Autumn Sale 2023 swung by and I bought the game for 13 dollars.

Nearly two hours into the game was enough to disappoint me. The premise of the game is pretty solid, I love how unique the plot is. The concept of running your own graveyard in a medival town is great, too, but the execution of all these great ideas were lacking. First off, I was overwhelmed by the sheer number of things to do within the game. Normally, that wouldn't bother me but the game has such vague, unclear tutorials that I couldn't tell what exactly the game wanted me to do next.

That brings me to the quest log... or the lack of a quest log, in better words. It took me one hour and fifteen minutes to figure out that the quest log was underneath the ""NPC/Character"" tab in the game. And it wasn't even a quest log with guides like waypoints or a minimap directing you to them, it was just a list of characters with some quick bullet points beneath them telling you in simple words what they want you to do next. I was lost and became bored with the game pretty quickly.

My breaking point was when it took me 30-40 minutes just to figure out which river I needed to dump a body into (that sentence sounds so wrong without any context XD). The game has really pretty visuals, and an okay soundtrack, but I just couldn't get behind the gameplay. It's too vague, boring , and unclear.

tedious and confusing after a while
but the good is good

overall it's fun, but
-unlock cost of technology get's out of hand with blue; you can soft-lock yourself and will have to spend time on pointless grinding
-alchemy is not explained properly and very slow to unlock. Also lacks ""notebook"" tracking which materials give what.
-structures have no description of materials needed (in journal)
-npc daily/weekly schedule is pain
-npc sell items which are unlocked via reputation via selling them items, which doesn't explain what they're buying and you have limited time and inventory to test this out
-sandbox placement of structures is a lie; a lot of them need to be placed in exact locations due to limited building zones and moving them wastes half of your materials and lot of energy.

how to fix imo
-give easier source of blue points (autopsy blue points?)
-allow moving structures to another location
-allow purchase of multiple alchemy blueprints daily (3 absolute minimum, 5 recommended)
OR add teleport to npc, so you can buy them easly
-make a note on a wall that explains basics of alchemy
-show what items npc buys at all time
+add backpack that adds 10 inventory slots (mid game- armor slot)

The only thing I do recommend is playing with some sort of guide to follow in case you get confused with some of the tasks the villagers give you, sometimes its not super straight forward.

My primary criticism is the lack of explanation. Despite playing for 13 hours, I still don't know what I am supposed to be doing. NPCs request items, but how to get or craft most of them remains unclear. Meanwhile, I have trunks full of items with no clear purpose.

The skill tree is equally ambiguous. Unlocking something doesn't guarantee the ability to craft it, as necessary crafting skills may be located elsewhere in the tree. Discovering this only happens after unlocking, making the skill tree feel like a lottery.

The different points needed to unlock skills add another layer of confusion. The first two types are clear, but the third type - oh boy. You can create some with some items once and then that is it - you are essentially blocked from any progression. With no idea on how to obtain more or even ensuring the right skills are unlocked.

Some reviews mention the map being too big, especially considering the fast day/night cycle. Meeting specific characters at specific times or on certain days adds another layer of complexity.

Despite the title ""Graveyard Keeper,"" the game surprisingly has little to do with the graveyard or anything mysterious. Instead, it leans more towards a collect/craft/fulfill quests for NPCs gameplay. Remembering NPC requests becomes crucial because the summary is well - just a summary.

While I don't dislike the game, I am disappointed. The main mystery seems to be figuring out what I am supposed to do. Instead of a game with mysteries, I got a game that itself is a mystery.

    The story is prety simple *SPOILERS SPOILERS* : After a car accident you wake up in a medieval village and you obviously want to get back home *END OF SPOLERS*. Pretty straightforward and reasonable. Early in-game you meet Gerry, who, although suffers partial memory loss is willing to help you and the first issues start.
     While Gerry explains to you what a gravekeeper's job is he does so in a pretty brief manner. That itself would not be a problem BUT it is the way you treat/prepare the bodies is actually a big deal (even more so later in-game) and you can't just simply gloss over it. To make things worst if you somehow thought you understood, close the dialog box and realise you have no idea what you are doing you are not allowed to ask again. Gerry will sent you on some random quest to help him with his winelust (because, as you will come to realise, he is a drunktard) and you will be left alone to rake the internet for everything, which brings me to my second point.

      I aprecciate games that don't hold your hand, but what this game does is on exact opposite side of the spectrum. There aretings pretty simple to understand, (ex. talk to NPC, get quest) but there are also more complicated things that you won't be able to figure out yourself and you don't get a single pointer for them. I understand looking at forums every one in a very long while and it's perfect;y fine BUT doing it ALL THE TIME is not fun. 
       In a game that evolves several skills that are locked in their rerspective skill trees with sometimes no logical explaination to their unlock order, (ex. you learn to build gravestones then progress to carved gravestones and then to monuments and afterwards to marble gravestones which makes no sense), or even sometimes you only get a portion of a skill (I can gather common mushrooms but to gather other mushrooms I need to unlock the next skill), you will inevitably end up looking for hours at forums for tips on ""usefull skills"" or ""how to make the most out of your first week"" or ""how to get x points"" (because you need points yo unlock skills but more on that later). It's a lot to process so early in-game and if you don't do progress in a semi-optimal way it will create walls later that will have you wasting your time trying to speed this up only to realise the forced pacing.

        Which brings up the next issue : The game right from the get-go deceits you into thinking you can take things easy and do things at your own pace. DON'T YOU BELIEVE IT. In reality, the game has a seven-day week cycle with both day and night hours. Why this is a problem: because certain steps can only be taken on x day and if you miss it you will hit a wall until next week (rinse and repeat as nessesary). Specific NPC's appear ONLY on specific days and ONLY on pre-determined places, which means you have to travel sometimes the entire map to get the npc you want or simply camp in their spot and wait for them. This by itsel is fine, but not when combined with :

                            a) Super short days
                            b) Huge map
                            c) Snail walking pace
                            d) Artificial time checkers

        Now, lets analyse a bit. The days, while last around 5 minutes the majority of this time will be consumed by walking because of both points b and c. The map is VERY BIG and you have no sprint button on a seemingly fast character that you only realise is slow AF when you try to cross the map in a single day (NOT HAPPENING). For those of you who played Stardew Valley, imagine if the path leading to town took three hours to cross. By the time you reach your destination, the NPC you were looking for might have gone home, (the artificial time checker of 09:00 -17:00 NPC working hours) which creates anxiety because you know if you miss this your progress will halt for no reason. Now, there's an object that allows for fast travel, but it a) has a cooldown (perhaps too long) and b) it only allows traveling to certain locations, not every point of the map.

        Speaking of NPC's, this might be the first time that, with the exception of 3(?)(maybe) people, I want the rest of them to be hit by a meteorite and STOP EXISTING. Why ? BECAUSE THEY ARE A BUNCH OF DOUCHEBAGS ! In order to explain my beef with them I will jump in the time machine and recall a game from the past, Catleville. For those who have never played it I will say it was a fb game with the typical ""sprend five energy to do x task"", ""connect with your friend for extra energy and materials"" etc. The problem was, that at some point, the moment you opened up the game you were BOMBARDED with at least ten new quests on a DAILY BASIS, (even from NPC's you have not yet unlocked), and each one was about at least half a month's work to complete, which led to you easily having a thousand, (not exagerating there) active quests at the time. 
         Why this was important : The NPC's in this game do a less aggresive, (thank god), but similar type of thing. You can only talk to them about trading and completing quests. Now, that is fine BUT the quest themselves are rarely simple. In fact, the first quest you are assigned is to sell some ""approved meat"" at the local tavern. Sounds simple right ? IT'S NOT.  The meat itself is easy to come by (courtesy of Gerry) but to make it ""approved"" you are requred to find/craft certain things which where the issue lies. 
        Remember when earlier I complained about no-pointers?  This is case 1/1.000.000 why. It is never specified or even vaguely hinted at if you can craft the needed materials, purchase them or if there other ways to obtain them. You just ""stumble"" upon them only to realise that you need to do ANOTHER NPC's quests get them. And that's how the story goes about individual NPC's creating a tangled web of interlooping quests that take so much time and effort to complete that, by the time you are done you might as well have forgotten what you first set out to do (kinda like Skyrim but without the thrill or fun, only tediousness).
          Now you may think : ""Oh, this NPC is selling the x material I need. I don't have a lot of cash (#earlygameissues) but I have enough to buy waht I need"". WRONG ! And here's why I called them douchebags earlier : When you buy stuff from them the price increases ON AN ITEM BY ITEM SALE. What does that mean for you ? It means, that if you need ten cabbages and they initialy cost ten copper each when you buy them, (either together or individually in the same day), instead of paying one hundred copper (one silver) at the end, you may end up paying nearly two silver coins. Why? Because the price will keep increasing by a small margin after each item sold. Also for you, the same thing happens but with constantly decreasing values for your items.
            This where the game fails to teach you how economy works. I undrstand that if I need ten cabbages and that's all the stock the vendor has, it is very logical for him to increase the price...the next day. It makes no sense that such a mechanic exists and the only reason I can think for it to be there, is to artificialy extend gametime, (much like the other artificial walls). Cont. in comments because character limit.

First of all, you might have noticed that it looks like Stardew Valley. There are similarities in the gameplay, but overall the Graveyard Keeper stands out distinctly for its story and how intelligent the craft system is. Everything you'll be crafting you'll be crafting for a reason. People you'll meet you'll meet for a reason. Locations you'll discover... You get my point. In fact, many quests pertaining to the main story line can be solved in at least two different ways, e.g. a player who wants to pass it faster can just go and obtain the quest item in a certain faster way, and a player who is into crafting can take time and develop own capabilities to produce the quest item instead. The crafting tree accommodates choices, like a really well thought-through rpg tree.

The experience is marred by a tedious and mind-numbing loop that seems designed to test the patience of even the most dedicated players.

The game's grind is nothing short of soul-crushing. From the incessant farming to the repetitive crafting, it feels like you're stuck in a never-ending cycle of mindless tasks. The need to constantly gather resources, tend to crops, and perform mundane activities becomes more of a chore than an enjoyable gaming experience. It's as if the developers mistook monotony for immersion, leaving players drowning in a sea of uninspiring and repetitive actions.

One of the major issues is the constant onslaught of fetch quests. Graveyard Keeper seems to rely heavily on this tired and overused mechanic, making the game feel more like a glorified fetch quest simulator than an engaging simulation experience. Whether it's delivering items to the same NPCs over and over again or completing arbitrary tasks that add little to the overall narrative, the constant fetch quests quickly become a tiresome exercise in patience.

Moreover, the lack of meaningful progression and variety in tasks leaves players yearning for something more. The absence of compelling storylines or dynamic events makes the gameplay feel stagnant, and it's hard to shake off the feeling that you're simply going through the motions without any real purpose.

While Graveyard Keeper has its moments of charm and a unique premise, the overall experience is overshadowed by its insistence on a mind-numbing gameplay loop, excessive grinding, and an overreliance on fetch quests.

- The lack of instruction/direction. While I like a game that doesn’t hold your hand and lets you figure out the mechanics on your own (like SDV), I felt absolutely clueless playing this game. You get shown at the start how to dissect and bury bodies and after that you’re on your own. By the time you’ve figured out how to do anything, or where to get the items you need to complete quests, multiple days have passed and it just feels like so much wasted time. Maybe it’s just me but I found this game absolutely frustrating to get into. A lot of grind for not a lot of result.

- The length of days/speed of character. The time it takes your character to do anything is ridiculous. The game is set up with a 6 day week, and the days are really short (around 7 minutes sunrise to sunrise).  Each day has a specific person to meet to further you on with quests. But your character is SO SLOW. I’m not kidding, it takes almost an entire day to get across the map which resulted in me missing characters I needed to meet several times and having to wait an entire extra week. I’m all for time management games, but this game feels like it needs an extreme amount of organisation skills just to do basic things. This is made even worse by….

- Your character’s pathetic energy levels. I’m assuming these levels must go up through the game, and as you get more advanced you’ll have better access to food to up your energy levels. But honestly, I would wake up, spend a short amount of time chopping some trees, burying a body, etc. and my character would be ready for bed again. As mentioned, you don’t have a lot of time in the day, and it felt like I could get NOTHING done without my character needing a stupid little nap (that wastes even more time). Everything takes an insane amount of time or a ridiculous amount of energy.

Personally, I wouldn’t recommend this game. Maybe I didn’t give it as much as a chance as I should have, or maybe I just severely lack the organisational skills to have any level of success in it.

Some small aspects feel like a chore but generally it's really well balanced between crafting, automation, and manual work. There's even a lite-RPG-like character progression tree I liked to work on. There's a fandom wiki that helps figuring out some facts - I wasted some time figuring out stuff, which became more clear when reading up on the wiki. Definitely recommend you do the same!

Summarized, if you like crafting games with a nice, sometimes ironic and generally also wholesome story, then this is for you. I bought it in a sale and got my money's worth for sure. Got probably good 70 hours out of it (not rushing through). Edit: 85hours in so far - still great. I am actually considering buying the a few of the DLCs now.

EDIT: [strike]My previous review mentioning the no-audio issue somehow disappeared.[/strike] (Steam UI being stupid) Apparently this game uses FMOD that crashes on startup without crashing the game making the audio subsystem not work.
-I got that fixed by plugging the unused P2 socket in my computer case, opening the game and then unplugging, it allows the audio to initialize properly and then I can use my actual headphone playback device.

-I played for about 9 hours, this game is an absolute chore, never ending grind.
-It's a mocking joke attempt at being a Stardew copycat, everything is jank.
-The options menu is pathetic, barely any options and the keybinds are an afterthought, as they made with gamepad controls first. 
-The mouse buttons can't be bound or rebound and the click position is irrelevant as the actions happen in front of the character anyway.
-I spent 40% of my time walking, 30% holding Y, 20% shuffling through interfaces so I could hold Y again, and 10% checking on the internet about what the hell I should be doing since the ""Townspeople Relationships"" menu tab is made to be vague as possible and BASIC PROGRESSION is locked behind key NPC interactions THAT YOU HAVE TO WAIT A WHOLE WEEK IF YOU MISS THEM or get delayed in cutscenes long enough for the day to end. (I had to wait a whole extra week just to unlock mud).

EDIT 2: I've been told to add my extra rant as part of the review, so I'm pasting the segment below:
Basically ingame you make your cemetery to +5 reputation so the cleric priest dude doesn't hate it, then he opens the church for you and tells you you can preach, after doing the cutscene you can explore the church and the basement, but I got that near the end of the day and by the time I left he already left, [b][i]YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO LEAVE AND TALK TO HIM AT THE ENTRANCE.[/i][/b] talking to him gives ""Concept of Mud"" to the tech tree (a root node in the tech tree) and then he asks for 20 bowls...",1700712433,1700812600,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

and much more new mechanics which Graveyard Keeper brings such as graveyard rating, Building a church and graveyard so more people come to your prayers (money making and amassing prayers for technology research).

Technologies are bought using 3 different currencies, which you gain by examining objects at the research table which needs research points and prayers from the church. Such a great elaborate but simple enough system that keeps you on the grind that the story lines up with.

DLCs are pretty awesome, each of them adds a different mechanic to the game such as managing and building your tavern, some kind of a colony sim with a camp or zombies which you can use to automate many things. Also each of those DLCs have a nice long enough quest that comes with it, which completely branch out a fitting continuation to the story wether you have finished the main story or not.

A lot of people compare it to Stardew and I won't entirely disagree as I love that one as well and it has a bit of the vibe, however very different.
You're not building friendship, you're doing specific story line tasks to gain rep with the townsfolk. The combat isn't nearly as much as Stardew requires.

Still there are some downsides to this Game. In the beginning it is kinda hard to unterstand the mechanics and find out on how to progress smoothly in this Game. Throughout the Game you have to collect many Items and grind them over and over again until later in the Game. The Quests are okay-ish but could get kinda annoying after 10 quests only to realize you have to do another small thing for the same Person. The Week cycle is alright but sometimes you need one specific character for a quests, so you have to wait for his specific Day to come which can get unpleasant in the End.

Also the game overall doesn't deserve 86% positive review, it should be about 70 at most for the sake of the Donkey. 3-5 Hours playtime reviews are nonsense and shouldn't be valid to take count into overall ratings.

This game was on my wishlist for the past 5 years. I bought the complete pack on the last halloween sales and the game loaded all DLCs so I started as it is. It took me about 77-78 hours to complete all quests the game offers and I have spent another 5-6 hours to get rest of the achievements like fishing, burying bodies etc. which was boring instead of a relaxing experience. I was able to withstand boredom by the power of second monitor content.

There are not much of a pros but [b]THE STORY[/b] was the biggest part for me. I've enjoyed following the story of The Village and NPCs most of the time. And dialogues were usually good, except for lazy written shallow fetching quests. There were funny references I won't spoil. It was fine stories overall.

There are a lot of cons and lack of QoL features which are obvious and never got an update since the release despite getting 3 DLCs. Let me tell the ones I hated most because you will get bothered by it too.

1) There are queue system for some items in the crafting stations only if you can't change ""input"" items for example crafting 1x Flitch to 1x Wooden Plank or growing veggies from seeds. You can que these 10x or even set for ∞ which would keep crafting as long as you have input items in your storage. BUT most of complex items you cannot que and have to craft one by one and scroll down to select the input item every single time because the game doesn't remember which input item you want to use. For example a Burger: you can cook a burger with a ""Bronze, Silver or Gold"" quality onions which would affect your output as a bronze, silver or gold quality burgers AND the game asks you everytime which ingredients you like to use after you craft a single burger, SO you can't que this and every other item that have ""quality"" inputs and outputs (except auto-farming).

2) You spend your hours mostly running left and right, finding right people in the right day and right time and try to fetch their quest before end of day. There is a teleporter stone, it is the first thing you are gonna buy, but it has 30 seconds cooldown, also cooldown ticks only if you don't have any open UI like a inventory, chest, shop, map etc. And teleportstone doesn't even let you teleport to Morgue or Graveyard, you have to walk from home everytime. It is a short distance, maybe ten seconds walk without a ""Speed Potion"" but when you do that everyday and sometimes more than once, it becomes so much time wasted walking. Once you get your hands onto speed potions you want that effect up always. A speed potion doubles your movement speed for 10 in-game minutes; a day is 7 minutes 30 seconds which speeds up if you sleep or meditate, so you will need approx 5 speed potions for every game-week (6 days) if you want to keep the speed up always. You want to buy Speed Potions as much as you can from the shop because if you go for the ""craft yourself"" option, this means you have to ""draw blood"" from dead body everyday, use 5 of them on your speed potions and able to keep only 1 blood/week for other needs and alchemy products. There are many spots and people/shop you can't teleport and have to walk, thus speed potion is a life saver.

3) There are so many items that mostly comes from quests are trash and there is no way to get rid of these trash items. You cannot destroy them and you have to keep crafting trash storage chests and store them in there forever. And know that, the space you can put a chest or crafting station is LIMITED. And some of your first crafted items like Sword or Iron Armor is also trash and you cannot destroy them or sell them, you have to keep them forever!

4) Progression balance is off:
a) Technology progression; everything start so slow especially with the ""faith currency""; which is required for ""study table"" to gain research points; which is required to unlock new researches/technologies and perks in the tech tree. ""Faith"" is also required for some quests and grave quality items like better stones and marbles.

b) Graveyard quality progression; you want to jump to highest tier tombstones or one below before crafting anything between them because there isn't much difference in terms of inputs. Also there are some tombstones you can recycle back into a stone, some you can sell to special shop and some you CAN'T recycle nor sell, but at least you can ""destroy"" them instead of keeping forever in a trash chest. You are supposed to be a ""Graveyard Keeper"" but you will hate the graveyard and the morgue and mostly won't care about at all after the ""200 quality"" which is required for a quest. It seems you can push forward the quality of dead bodies and build a graveyard with over 1500 quality but it is just mindless grind. Devs also must be ralized the game loop wasn't fun, so they did not made quest or achievement for higher quality graveyard. I am giving plus point because of not forcing us to keep making better and better graves. Even catching 200 fish for an achievement was too much of a demand.

5) Inventory is small, managing it is shit. I don't know what would have I done without ""Game of Crones"" DLC which brings new ""bag"" mechanics. Don't get me wrong, bags are also mechanically shit but at least gives an extra inventory space. What do I mean by mechanically shit?

a) You have a ""Fishing bag"" which you can store your fish and fish baits in it. When you go to fishing, you can't select bait from your fishing bag, instead you have to carry those baits into your main inventory in order to use and select a bait from your different type of fish baits.

b) If you scroll down in your inventory, you can see all your bags and all the items inside of them. You can also use those items without opening those bags first. BUT you can't hold and carry those items between different bags without opening the bag first, move the item into your main inventory, open the next bag, and put it there from your main inventory. 

c) Also every bag takes a space in your main inventory, good luck managing your inventory when you have ten bags. It's just a mess. And since there isn't ""stack items"" button, you will go chest by chest and keep scrolling down in your bags to find if you have a matching item and then store it. If you keep unload your items to every chest you find, amount of chests at your home and garden won't be enough and you will have bigger storage management problems.

6) Alchemy Workbench notes: (Removed because of Steam review character limit. I recommend use Wiki for unknown recipes instead of random experimenting.) 

7) There are some MISSABLE ACHIEVEMENTS in quest dialogues. And since the game auto-saves only when you sleep, you can't load back later to different save file for different dialogue option to find out different outcomes. Which means, if you miss it, you have to start over a new game. For the completionists these achievements are;
a) [spoiler]He trusted you[/spoiler] b) [spoiler]Best seller[/spoiler] c) [spoiler]Apprentice[/spoiler] d) [spoiler]Alchemist[/spoiler] e) [spoiler]Master alchemist[/spoiler]

8) You will come across some cut content. For example, upon trying to enter some houses, the game tells you to have 80 reputation with the owners, but it is impossible; it just never made into the game. There are some more, you will see them.

[b]In the end, I watched Youtube contents on my second monitor all the time while playing the game and only gave my full attention for the story and dialogues which I enjoyed the most. Everyone is responsible for their own money and there are different regions and currencies too, so I won't say how much you should pay the most.[/b]",1699974637,1699975297,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Wanna be a own a chapel? Its there
Wanna explore a dungeon? Its there
Wanna just make graves? Interesting its there
Wanna make some undead Zombies to do stuff for you? its there
Wanna just play for story? ITS THERE alot....alot of it and i wanted to know more 

**DLCs****
Worth it also if you see the DLCs on sale get THEM!!!!! sooo goood add to the story and give you extra lil skill tree stuff 10/10
Heres hoping they add more to the story cause i want more!

****NOTES****
If they allowed more to do with the grave such as where i could put the plants/lights/stone prayers  instead of the lil squares that would be great.
If it showed what Items made what like to turn the brains what it does on them instead of trying over and over if you forget.

This game is very fun, but I wouldn't really recommend it if you hate grinding. Personally, I love it because of the simplicity while also feeling very complex. At first you will be confused by the mechanics but you'll catch on quickly. My 2.8 hours was in one sitting and was 100% enjoyable. My only complaint is that the game freezes up a little while saving but it's not too bad and my computer is by no means meant for gaming. Everything else runs smoothly considering that. Needless to say, if this sounds like a good time to you, I recommend it. And if you see it at a deal like I had? Don't bother hesitating. Don't know much about DLC but if you're on the unsure about it, I'd wait until a sale. Right now a 6 bundle is only 10.50 usd (including the base game).",1699440079,1699440079,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False

It's got all the good automation loops and stuff to make it seem like you're running an efficient zombie factory of goodness but it didn't ever feel that grind-y. If you don't find the zombies early enough or you don't capitalize on their aid that could change.

The story is great and the characters are funny. There's definitely a good amount to do (note - I am playing with the dlcs). Honestly I wouldn't focus on getting everything done all at once because that'll make it feel like you're grinding. Spread things out and enjoy the casual pacing - nothing has a time limit and adding one could make the game less fun.

The only thing that sucks is when you progress a quest and you need something from a day you just passed - ARGH! but honestly the week goes by so quickly that if you aren't worrying about how much time you're wasting or how you could've done that better, you'll distract yourself and in no time you'll have missed the day a second time!

Very enjoyable game, and I love the dlcs, they're definitely worth getting because I think they add a ton.

You only have the patience to tolerate so many of these time-gating farming sim games before you have to throw in the towel. With the plethora of time-gating mechanics and progression hurdles in these kind of games you already know that what could be 12-24hrs of actual content is going to be stretched into 100+hrs and even then you'll probably have even more to do. This game no joke cranks the tedium up to the absolute maximum.

I called it quits with this game when I realized how interconnected and dependent every resource and mechanic in the game is. Sitting there and blankly staring into space you can already imagine the the amount of time and in-game days it's going to take to get anything done.

Nothing I hate more in these types of games than you meeting a character and they give you a quest asking for an item before you can progress their story, but if you happen to leave it at home and you can't get back before the day ends which is the case 9/10 times, then you'd have to wait an entire in-game week before you can see them again. An in-game week is about one hour in real time. That'd be okay if all the important quest-related characters weren't locked behind a specific day of the week and you had enough time to make it back to your home and come back with the requested item.

This game is less about the sim compared to others in the genre and more about crafting and more crafting for the sake of more crafting while stretching out the playtime for as long as possible. I've already breached the 2hr cut-off, so I'm going to mod the grind out of the game making it actually worth playing and respecting of my time.

New:
The new playtime from 2hrs and on has been modded and boy the difference is night and day.  Vortex is the primary mod manager for this game and the Nexus version of BepInEx(hard requirement) ""pre-configured"" for Graveyard Keeper by the mod author ""p1xel8ted"". I downloaded most of p1xel8ted's mods that offer various QOL changes most of which are configurable with ""F1"" plugin menu like ""longer days"", ""SprintOn"", and ""thoughtful reminders"" about what day it is among other mods.

With the additional playtime it's become clear that the dialogue is the MVP, however fleeting it is for the ""story"", but the devs feel the need to interwove so many fetch quests and dependencies between all the quest characters that you just have to shake your head. Even with mods I could not be bothered to invest any more time into this game, as the crafting never ends.

I wish they gave main character some outfits to change his appearance.

Most of the negative reviews complain about the game being too grindy, lacking store space, and characters walking too slowly. Yes and no. I feel like the mixed reviews stem from one fundamental decision of the player, and that is whether to use the wiki.

You can craft speed potions, teleport to avoid walking, and craft store space in all working areas. However, the game lacks in explaining some core gameplay mechanics, and you are forced to use the wiki. If you are a pure gamer who feels that using the wiki is cheating, you are definitely going to hate this game.

I skipped some grindy elements like figuring out crafting potions and just searched the wiki for the recipe. I found myself just speedrunning the late gameplay just to finish the game.

It's not that I didn't like the game at all, I just think a lot of people would like it way less than I did. I have a pretty high tolerance for grinding (I mean, it's like meditation after a busy day), but this was too much, even for me. I've found myself frustrated while I was playing the game more often than I want to admit (seriously, I have been wondering so many times if there really wasn't an easier way to carry wood blocks one by one over a long distance before you had the resources to make a zombie - which you need the wood for - but no, sad long walks while carrying wood blocks it is...) Sometimes it's just a very frustrating experience. Like countless others have stated here as well, the game mechanics lack a proper rewarding system. You do a quest, simply to be rewarded by a new quest. And the fact that the crafting recipes aren't available outside your crafting station is just very annoying. You have to walk back and forth enough as it is! To deal with these kind of bad mechanics I just kept the wiki open on my second monitor, but if we're being honest here, I really shouldn't have had to.

So why did I stick with it so long anyway? Frankly, I absolutely loved the story, the theme, the humour and the atmosphere of the game. That is one of its kind. The story made me laugh many times and that's ultimately the thing that kept me longing for more. It almost made it worth it to put up with all of the game's flaws, but I wouldn't replay it. It's a game, not a book or a movie, so the fact that it lacks at what it's supposed to do at its core is a big miss. I think this game had a lot of potential and I'm disappointed it was often so frustrating to get through.

Then the thing that actually made me stop playing it: the lag. At some point late game, the game started having serious performance issues. Especially while walking through the woods, the frame rate would just drop constantly to a point where it became unplayable. I've tried everything to fix it, but the only thing I could find online is more people having the same issue. At some point I just gave up. It wasn't my PC, all my other games run fine without a problem, except this one. I find it disappointing, that instead of addressing these kind of technical problems and the game play issues, the team chose to add more DLCs instead, which just emphasize the problems the game already has. If these kind of issues would improve, I would definitely change this negative recommendation to a positive one.

Rating: ★★★★☆

Graveyard Keeper, the game where I started off as a simple graveyard caretaker and ended up as the go-to gravedigger for the entire afterlife, all while having deep conversations with judgmental talking skulls (after 50 hours of macabre merriment).

Pros:

- I've unlocked the secrets of corpse recycling. Who knew that you could turn a cadaver into a culinary masterpiece? Cooking is just one shovel away from becoming a cooking show on the dark web.
- The game's world is like a surreal parody of medieval life. You'll find yourself trading in skulls, debating philosophy with a donkey, and wondering if you've stumbled into the afterlife's version of a sitcom.
- I've learned that even skulls can have attitude. The snarky comments from talking skulls are like the highlight of my day, next to discovering new ways to make questionable pies.

Cons:

- My graveyard is a labyrinth of oddities. I've buried everything from humans to carrots, and I suspect that my cemetery is the final resting place for a missing sock or two.
- I've developed an irrational fear of mules. The donkey's judgmental eyes follow me wherever I go, as if it's keeping score of my questionable life choices.
- The game's humor is like a dark comedy routine. You'll find yourself chuckling at the absurdity of life, death, and making friends with the deceased.

Graveyard Keeper is a game that takes the macabre and adds a healthy dose of humor and absurdity. It's the kind of game where you'll start with dreams of maintaining a respectable cemetery and end up laughing at the peculiarities of the afterlife.

To those contemplating life, death, and questionable pies: Embrace the oddity, accept that your graveyard is a land of surprises, and remember that in Graveyard Keeper, it's not about the destination; it's about the hilariously morbid journey.

In conclusion, Graveyard Keeper is where I've learned that when life gives you corpses, talking skulls, and dark humor, you bury, you converse, and you laugh through the bizarre afterlife.

I strongly suggest getting all three DLCs to have an overall more satisfying game experience. The DLCs add extra content, more quests, and more ways to earn in-game currency. The gameplay loop is very satisfying and chill (except for 2 achievements you don't have to worry about missed opportunities and there are no time limits), enough so that I played it twice all the way through. The humor is excellent - just dark and satirical enough to be funny without becoming disturbing. I really did find myself laughing out loud at moments!

- Beautiful, consistent visuals.
- Memorable sound design. 
- Great characters/narrative.
- Satisfying controls.

Combine all that together and you get a truly immersive story.

Cons:
- Restrictive customization, especially with how you lay out your graveyard.
- No character customization, not even clothes/hats.
- There is nothing to do after you complete the base game. No ambient objectives, no big-ticket items to work toward.
- No specialization. You are expected to unlock everything, you only get to pick the order you do it.

Combine all that and you get a game that has zero replay value.

I can't recommend the DLC, and here's why:
- Customization is just as restrictive in the DLC areas.
- There is still very little to work toward. No new big-ticket items. No challenging areas.
- New money-making methods fall flat because of the lack of end-game goals.
- Specialization/decision making is still non-existent.

Graveyard Keeper is a beautiful game that I'm happy I experienced, but I probably won't pick it up again for years, if ever. There's not enough personal attachment because there's so little choice. There's nothing keeping me hooked because I already did everything. DLC just gives me more of the same. 

I'd love to see those issues addressed, but even if they never are I do still recommend this game.

Everything now costs too much currency, points, or whatever. I don't mind a grindy game, but right now I'm not prepared to grind this one out.

Compared to Starview Valley this game is more complex, most things depend on other things, more tangled ways to go forward. Using the wiki is essential, it would be crazy making to try and puzzle-solve it. I like the time cycles, and the energy bar, you just need food, regular sleep, and plan ahead. I don't like having to triple check I've got everything before I go and build something, so many times I've walked to a work table and something is wrong or I've forgotten something, yes my inaccuracy, but that's not fun, it's just annoying. I have to alt tab back and forth to the wiki, over and over, and that's even with me writing down notes. Take notes it makes it easier.

All up though if you're prepared to be organised it's fun, plenty of good things in the game.

Here's my issues with the game: 

-the lighting is dim as hell in the tunnels/the morgue. There's no option to fix this, you just have to increase your screen brightness. in my case, that gives me a headache. So i wish they had lighting options.

- You can't remap anything to the mouse buttons. 

- So many of the technologies require blue research points - which are a pain to obtain, even late game. 

- Faith is a valuable resource - And its only generated in small amounts once a week, until you have a confessional (in which case, you can get one additional faith)

 - The Alchemy table doesn't keep track of what combinations you've tried, so you IRL have to keep track of what you're experimenting. You also need to spend those ever valuable faith tokens on studying things. The alchemy recipes also aren't intuitive or logical, so you either need to cheat (by using the wiki) try every single combination (which amounts to a lot of resources wasted) or buy the recipes from the swamp witch, Clotho. Which is expensive, and money is in short supply early in the game. And the easiest ways to increase that money require substantial investment.

- Characters refuse to talk to you if they're on the move. Which means you sometimes have to wait an entire in-game week to continue a quest.

- There's a shoe-horned in fishing minigame that has some counter-intuitive logic, and is also just generally annoying to deal with, especially since inventory management is so important in this game. 

- There's just so much waiting. Sure, you can use the meditation in the stone garden to speed time up, but you're still waiting in real time for things to pass in the game. The days are short which gives you small time windows to interact with characters, but things only happen once a week - and there's very little to fill your time with otherwise, especially between quests.

- There can be quite a lot of material grinding, for very little reason. Add in the time problems, and inventory management, and there's a lot of running around shoving things in chests. 

Its a beautiful game, with a beautiful soundtrack, but i have a number of issues with the game mechanics and balancing. So make of that what you will.

Hauling logs is actual hell, since its so stressful to push them across distances with the game physics. Would love some kind of update in the tech-tree to upgrade your character to make it possible to carry multiple logs, or create a hauling cart to move stone deposits or logs yourself rather than relying on zombies (if you have the dlc).
There are sooo many small refining stations just to get the one item you actually need. Crafting menus are frustrating sometimes because you can't queue multiple of certain items and have to wait for the item to finish crafting before making more.
Faith is also quite frustrating sometimes, too, as you can only gather it on one day every in-game week. Alchemy also heavily relies on faith, as you are not able to craft anything unless you have ""researched"" each item, which costs faith points. There is another way to gain faith, which is requires certain gold-star foods to be sold at the inquisition food stand, but guess what? You need to know alchemy to upgrade fertilizers, which means you need a lot of faith to gain another method of gaining faith.

There's easily 100 hours of storyline in this game, especially if you're a completionist like me and would like to get all the achievements. The base storyline is really well executed and the DLC adds to the game in a way that makes sense. 

There's a limit to placing things down; you can put down a chest/furnace/anvil/etc. anywhere you'd like but in a secluded space picked out for you. This sometimes bothered me with space in certain areas, but it hasn't been that big of a problem.
I've read a few things online about lag spikes and the game being unplayable because of lag, but personally I've never experienced this. You will, however, notice lag spikes when you leave lots of stuff lying on the ground (like logs, pieces of stone, marble, etc.) So make sure to clean up after yourself :)

Overall, an amazing game with a lot of life and some awesome achievements to get. I could see myself starting up a new save just for fun even after completing the storyline and achievements in full.

""The Town"" and the town pass are bogus. Don't waste your money. Really insulting to the community what they pulled with this. Reddit has warned me that most of the DLC is garbage, so I am unlikely to come back later to check that out.

They could have had something special here and they screwed it up.

Edit: I saw someone playing this on YouTube and decided to give it another go and while I am probably going to finish the game, I still don't really recommend it. 

The resource grind doesn't seem too bad when you first start or even close to mid game, but that will change and it will feel like a slog fest. For starters, science is a painfully slow resource to collect, it's the most limited in where you can collect it and it's also one of the resources that pays the least when collecting it. Studying organs you collect can be helpful, but you'll start running out of those eventually as well since you can only study each organ once.

Then there's the wood. How I hate the wood. You'll be using it for a lot of different things, so it's a resource you need to be constantly collecting. Having to drag around those huge logs is such a pain in the ass it isn't funny and I personally believe may be one of the biggest time sinks in the game.

Sure, you can push a log on the ground, you can abuse the pick up and drop mechanic to try and juggle logs, but it doesn't  change the fact it is one of the worst aspects of the game. Even more frustrating is the fact that the Quarry has it's own little area where you can build stuff, so it allows you to just collect resources and break them down. It feels like almost all resources besides the wood has something like this.

You can spend HOURS just moving wood around, it's utterly ridiculous.

You know, the developers could have toned down on some of this crap a little bit and it probably would have been a better game for it. A game doesn't need to be sixty hours. As a matter of fact the older I get the less I appear to enjoy games that expect that much time from me.",1665055938,1697005580,False,1,0,0.492307692766189575,0,True,False,False

I didn't hate it and I had some fun with it, but those moments were too few and far between. Some people love it, but it fell far short of my expectations.

I was expecting a darker and more morbid Stardew Valley, and maybe that is what this game is trying to be, but it is missing what made Stardew fun and rewarding and ends up feeling like an unfinished chore simulator. Everything feels like an elaborate fetch quest, and a lot of the systems in the game feel like they were added just to stretch out the time you had to grind instead of creating an intuitive leveling process. There's no way to skip time/days, which becomes a real issue when the NPC you need to talk to only shows up on one day of a week and all your other quests are gated behind this interaction. The story started out fun and intriguing, but once you sink a few hours into it, it gets lost completely.

I was surprised to find the game so tedious, story-lacking, and bug ridden considering how highly it is rated on Steam. I hit several softlocks and bugs during gameplay, none of which have been fixed despite the game being out for 5 years, and the combat is atrocious. Not because it is hard, but because it is frustrating and unpolished. Spend some time in the dungeon and you will quickly see what I mean. I hate to keep comparing Graveyard Keeper to Stardew Valley, but I cannot find one thing this game does better or any reason to choose it over the latter. I expected better from something with a Very Positive review status.

Installing some mods makes the game a lot more tolerable and reduces some of the massive grind for materials and moving around the map, which is probably the only reason I am still playing it. The tutorial is very basic and unclear, and I spent a large amount of time using the wiki to figure out how to do things because it was so poorly explained in the game. Some people may enjoy the more ""figure it out yourself"" learn by trial and error approach, but I just found it tedious. 

All that being said, I didn't hate Graveyard Keeper. I enjoyed some of it, and there are some genuine moments of great humor and rewarding experiences. I think there's a fun game in here somewhere, but it is lost in the monotonous grind, frustrating leveling, and unfinished feel of the story and quests. I plan to play it until the end, and if the payoff was worth it, I will revise this review. Maybe the DLCs provide a better experience and ending, but I will not be buying them when the base game proved to be a disappointment and does not feel like a finished game.  With some QoL updates, storyline adjustments, and fine tuning, this could be a much better product, but as it stands I don't find it worth the cost.",1696894588,1696894588,False,61,2,0.760509967803955078,0,True,False,False

For me, the fact that there's multiple kinds of wood (filches, boards, planks, billets, wedges, firewood, poles) and you need different tools to make most of them, and different tools to make twelve different metals, and you have to walk for nearly 75% of a day time to reach something you need to repair only to find out that you brought frickin' BOARDS instead of PLANKS just - it was so unappealing for me.  

The artificial grind is real. Every single thing requires you to have ten other single things, which each requires you to have ten other things. It was as I was staring blankly at what was needed for a wood repair kit and trying to calculate how to get all of that while inwardly groaning about needing to upgrade my anvil that I realized -- no.

I have to agree with many of the other reviews in that this game definitely has an unfinished feel to it.  The crafting system is clunky at times and is compounded by the fact that the player is highly restricted as to where crafting stations maybe placed.  The result is a lot of unnecessary running back and forth.  For example, if you want to craft new benches for your church you have to build them from the crafting station in the church, as opposed to the carpenter's bench in front of your house.  These may seem nit picky but as you progress into mid to late game it becomes evident that this is done on purpose in order to pad out the remainder of the game.  This is especially obvious  when doing various quests for the NPCs.  They will request that you gather a selection of gold rank items required to complete their request.  You do so, only for them to add another extremely difficult item to procure.  You only have one in game day to run back to the house and grind out that item.  If you're unlucky, you will have to wait a whole in game week before progressing.  Then after giving them said item, they often will request a third item or worse will give you a task to interact with another NPC that won't appear until six days later.  If this happened once or twice, I would have simply ignored it.  I had to do this for six or seven different NPCs, back to back to the point that I started to get kind of bored with the game.  Graveyard Keeper really needs a number of quality of life upgrades to make this less of a slog.

So would I recommend this game?  Maybe.  But not at full price.  It's not a bad game, it just feels like the devs squeezed as much money as they could from it.  Slapped some DLC's on an unfinished product and abandoned it.  It's really a shame.  The game had potential to be a good Stardew Valley clone.",1696353475,1696353475,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Walking takes forever, especially in dense areas (despite limited fast travel option).

- Large items can only be picked up one at a time after which you have to drop it off, return and do it all over again until you've gone through the entire pile (wooden logs, big pieces of rock, etc),

- The tech tech takes forever to build up.

- Large amount of unclear goals and items. Practically impossible to play without the wiki, telling you how to create things, what the use of things is, etc.

This is a perfect example of a game that needed someone on the development team (with power) to tell them to rein it in and finish what they had before adding more shit. There's just too much shit in the game that serves no purpose other than create additional time wasting (the durability system on tools and weapons for instance). And then there's a scene in the late-game that can hard-lock your game if you don't catch it. It's the final quest chain with snake. If you don't have two item slots in your inventory free that you need for the two quest items you get in the cutscene, the extra one isn't dropped on the floor, it doesn't get anywhere and if you save, that's it for your game. There's lots of bullshit like this. Though my biggest gripe with it is just how much of the game requires things that you don't really have any way of knowing other than trying everything in existence, requiring for me an excessive use of the wiki which just isn't fun.

Is there fun to be had? Yes. When it works the basic gameplay loop can be very fun, but the game frequently makes it less so by inducing arbitrary grind. The worst of which is requiring the use of 12 GOLD pieces (in a game that deals with coppers and silvers in trade) for an items towards but not at the end. And it's not something you require at the end or know that ""ok, get this but after that you need this"" no you have to grind for weeks (game time) to get that money and during it you can't do ANYTHING for prep for what you need after. Then there's other arbitrary grinds after like asking one guy to attend an event and he says no and asks you to ask another guy that takes almost a week because of the distance between then (bear in mind that at this point there isn't much to do other than the few quest tasks).. Also the game doesn't tell you it has a system to pass time (because unlike Stardew Valley you can't just go to sleep and it's the next day, for no reason). There's another section that's similar where you can't make any progress on anything until you research 20-30 technologies.

There's also the dumbest system I've seen in ANY game. Instead of logs and big stones and iron blocks going into your inventory or a gathering place it gets added into the physical world and you have to either grab it one-by-one (often somewhat large distances) or form a line to move a larger section of them before moving one by one. That someone thought that system was a good idea baffles me. It adds so much unneeded time wasting. The fact that you can't check crafting recipes when not at a station (the distances are quite a ways from each other) is another absolutely baffling one.

At the end of the day, the game has fun in it, but there are so many bad systems and just unfinished systems, design, and bugs that just prevent the game from being as fun as it could be. If the game ended before the final end-game grind, I'd probably be more positive about this.

If after reading this you still decide to give it a go, you might end up having fun, I had fun for some of my time, but given all the problems with the game, I cannot recommend it.",1695970424,1695970424,False,76,2,0.710486471652984619,0,True,False,False

I agree to some of the reviews here where the grinding aspect is too much. I've basically wasted so much time trying to figure out what to do next.

It has a tech tree for unlocking new resources, buildings and perks to help you along. There is no time limit to quests so take your time to learn the system slowly and gain research points which is the main bottleneck.

The corpse mechanics are like a mini puzzle and I found it especially interesting to try and get a perfect corpse either for the graveyard or zombies. The alchemy system is important for this so as I said before, take your time. In fact, leave alchemy for last and focus on bookmaking/story writing to earn research points. Do not neglect food buffs as they stack with each other. Similar buffs add more time to a particular buff while different ones can exist alongside others. Potion buffs are separate and stack similar to the food buffs which I find incredibly helpful late-game when my time is the most limiting factor. Zombies help with basic resource collection so use them well to free up time for other things only you can do.

In conclusion, this game is a good addition to its genre with its own mechanics that make it stand out. It does get grindy but having stuff to do in a game like this is a good thing since the ""end game"" for these types of games usually end up with the player having too much wealth to spend and nothing to spend it on. Each tech upgrade feels important and logical although I dislike having certain branches of tech locked behind the story.

THE GOOD: I vastly enjoyed the puzzle solving in this game which occurs because the game gives almost no instructions on its mechanics.  I avoided looking up solutions on the internet and felt rewarded when progressing the game.  Critical thinking is crucial in the first half.  

THE UGLY: by late game, you realize most tasks and enterprises you invested in have little payoff and the game devolves into a slog.  The automation features ([spoiler]zombie[/spoiler]) seemed clever at first, but you can only automate a couple steps before your character's involvement is required.  I get this isn't a factory building game, but running around to address supply chain bottlenecks was exhausting and, by the 2nd half, this tedium became the game.

Also, it has been almost 2 years (10/22/21) since the last DLC, so I think the developers finally decided to abandon it for good.

[h1]TLDR:[/h1]
[h2]Pros:[/h2]
++++Beautiful Pixel Art graphics
+A story
++Some well-thought characters

[h2]Cons:[/h2]
------- Frustrating grind fest
---- Bad technology tree
------ Walking
-------- Horrible RNG system
--- Mechanisms lacking any kind of logic
-- Save system
--- Bad game mechanics

[h1]Eplained:[/h1]

[h2]Grindfest & Tech-Tree:[/h2]
Do you know the feeling when you finish some grinding in a game and the game rewards you and you suddenly feel accomplished and happy? You won't get that from this game. This game ""rewards"" your grinding with EVEN MORE GRINDING.

Example #1: [spoiler] Let's say you want to create some Acid Injection which is the SECOND tech that you can unlock in the alchemy tree. How hard can it be, right? Here are the steps to do so:
1) Unlock the tech
2) Build the Church workbench
3) You need Acid for it (shocker)
4) Whoops for Acid you need Alchemy workbench tier 2. 
4a) Unlock Alchemy storage
4b) Unlock Alchemy workbench tier 2.
5) Build the Alchemy workbench tier 2. to do so first unlock: 
Sawing, Woodworking, Assembly stand, Circular Saw, Iron, Glass, Glassblower, Glassblower 2, Primitive Forging, Advanced Forging, Advanced Smelting, Iron Castings.
6) To create Acid you will need to build a Hand mixer, a Distillation cube and an alchemy mill
7) NOW you can create Acid for the injection
But by the time you create your first Acid injection you already kinda forgot why you wanted it in the first place [/spoiler]

Example #2: [spoiler] Sell meat! The game tells you right at the beginning so it should be possible right? NOT ON MY WATCH!
You need a stamp to sell meat. The ways to get it:
A): Buy it with the Royal service
It costs you 50 silver so you have to grind for some money. Early game, you can only get money by buring corpses. A single burial certificate sells for 1s 50c that means you have to bury ~34 corpses. Since donkey only comes every couple of days that might as well take you 50 in game days.

B): Get it from Snake. To do so.......:
1) Unlock the lower part of the basement (gotta unlock a good couple of techs for it)
2) Meet Snake
3) Get 5 faith ~2 prayer days should be enough
4) Convince Snake to give you some stuff you need to take to the other part of the map
5) Unlock the gate
6) Battle your way through the dungeon to level 4+
7) Kill Iron Maidens to get bloody nails for Snake
8) Craft Bucket of Blood for Snake
9) Receive stamp

All this just to sell meat which is basically THE FIRST THING THE GAME TELLS YOU TO DO!! [/spoiler]

[h2]Walking:[/h2]

You pretty much have to walk everywhere. There is a teleport stone that can take you to any of the main locations, but other than that it's walking. Which doesn't sound bad, but if you have to walk between the house and the chuch/graveyard multiple times it will get on your nerves doesn't matter if you go in the tunnels or up on the surface.

Also the walking patchs are unnecessarily zig-zagged. (If you want to extend the time it requires to finish the game there are better ways for it.)

[h2]RNG:[/h2]

I've yet to meet a single person that enjoys RNG system in games. Especially if the RNG even takes long time. 
Example: You want to make silver star wine. You load 2 buckets of silver star grapes into the barrels, then after SIX MINUTES later you see that the gods of RNG hate you, so you get bronze star wine.

[h2]No logic[/h2]

Seed system makes no sense. Your crops will drop some seeds at haverst but -again... RNG- sometimes not enough to replant them so you have to keep going to the town for seeds. Unless you grind another quarter year to unlock quality fertilizer with which the plants will PROBABLY give you enough seeds to replant.

This hurts me on a personal level in case of Wheat.... it drops Wheat, and Wheat seeds...... In short, you cannot replant the Wheat grain that you harvested as you'd do IRL.... you gotta use the ""seeds""..... I worked in agriculture for years. This is a personal attack.

[h2]Save system [/h2]

There is no manual save or load. You go to bed, the game autosaves. You want to reload the start of the day because you missed an event? Too bad, you  have to manually exit to the main menu and reload your last sleep time.

[h2] Bad mechanics [/h2]

Let's say you study an ingredient at the study table. It will tell you what kind of stuff it can be decomposed into. But won't tell you exatly what you will get. Even if you do some decomposition, it will still only show the type. So you either must have an excellent memory, or have the wiki constantly open in the background and alt-tabbing like a maniac. By the way alt-tabbing..

The game autopauses the instant the screen loses ""focus"" on the game. So you cannot kill the time of waiting with browsing memes while your character SLEEPS or meditates... nooo... you have to watch them. 

[h1] Conclusion: [/h1]

In conclusion, Graveyard keeper is a frustrating grindfest of a game that offers wide variety of things to grind for without any reward or resultion.

599140,146180815,76561198065753606,88,5,4964,0,4964,1693375453,"For a game titled ""Graveyard Keeper"", there's actually very little graveyard keeping.

If it wasn't because the plot says so and the game demands you to improve the graveyard in order to progress, setting foot on the graveyard is very counter-productive.

Most quests and items required are outside the graveyard and church grounds, not to mention those NPCs and resources available only to the other side of the city, near the shore.
I've heard from a friend who played this game a while ago that there wasn't a warp stone before recent updates/DLC. I'd say the game is practically a walking simulator without them.

It sounds like I'm trash talking this game, but I'm not. I had fun with this game, but it had a redundant grind associated to it. For example, how badly the game communicates how are you supposed to progress. Initially, advancing through the game hoarding stuff looks promising and natural since most improvements are locked behind many requirements and buildings updates. But the tech tree is heavily dependant on quests and some quests are time based (why's there a week system where NPCs are only available at certain days? It adds nothing to the game).

IF you spoil the game (seriously, I had to look up the wiki in order to understand why some techs were locked) and manage to balance your production/quest completion, you'll still have to anticipate your daily planning really well.

I think the main character isn't supposed to sleep at all, considering you ought to be present and talk to several people, attend to many events, traverse considerable distances (even with shortcuts/warp stone) and STILL buy/sell useful stuff, cook and mind bodies incoming in order to at least prevent their unattended decay.

One of the DLCs (the Better Save Soul one) feels heavily out of place since it adds quests/requirements and a new area demanding your attention without unlocking much improvements to the main quest that are actually useful before late game.

What I feel that at least was worth the logistics nightmare is how well written and characterized the game is. Fulfilling quests not only gave me a well earned break from running around doing errands, but the cinematics and dialogues had meaning and impact. The game still works based on NPCs demanding crap from you, but to see the story unfolding once you progress is honestly really great.

If the Devs could only highlight stuff that you actually NEED to do on quest log (i.e. ""bring Ms. Charm 1 gold-star story and 1 Jewelry"" instead of ""convince Ms. Charm to help""), UNLOCK technologies based on what you discover rather than talking to NPC (why for the love of God would I need a technology in order to grab a shovel and get some sand/clay?), fix alchemy (WHY wouldn't I be able to simply buy the alchemy recipe I want, instead of buying random recipes? Cooking works like that, why Alchemy doesn't??).

And last but not least, make more items SELLABLE. I get that the game directs you to progress towards interesting and complex items in order to get money, but in my opinion, most of ""too much grinding"" complaints are based on the fact that most dishes, beverages, and equipment are 100% junk taking inventory space.

I might be wrong, but 99,99% of NPCs don't buy anything, not even their own stuff they offer to sell. Then why the game have tons of dishes and different fish and farming? You may use the trading license to sell some stuff, but it is way too slow and just ignores everything else you have (potions, dishes, any other non-rusty tool, not even the cherished marble statues the bishop like so much are sellable).

If you potential player can bypass this critical points I made, I'd say you can find the game funny and enjoyable. It does give a gothic Stardew Valley vibe if it weren't for these issues. I think it is still fine once the grind is overcome and you exercised your patience and gathered everything stress-free.",1694540941,1694540941,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As a compeletionist I also think this game is really a gem!

I have an overall positive view of the game, but I'm going to be honest. It definitely feels like parts of it were unfinished, phoned in or rushed. That particularly includes the DLC. May contain light spoilers! Most of this is going to be gripes, but as I said, I love this game, so if I don't mention a mechanic or part of the game that means it's at least serviceable if not fantastic! I will come and edit to add more to this review if I think of anything I missed!

The pixel art and camera angle is exactly my style, and is a major part of why I chose this game above others when looking for this style of game. It's very well done. 

The story/humor/mystery is well done for the most part, though some gets a bit lost in translation, and isn't well fleshed out or explained. The characters are fun and quirky, but not annoying. 

That having been said; I would have liked to see some sort of journal that saved conversations! It would help tremendously when doing quests!

Overall the gathering, building, crafting and such are engaging and fun (if you enjoy the grind like I do). I get that the mechanics are designed to be a time/resource sink, so you have to be okay with that if you want to enjoy the game. However, there are some bugbears. Let's get into them...

Firstly, not being able to stop/edit crafting machines that are on a timer is super annoying. 

Secondly, after studying something, it would be nice if the tool tip would actually show you clearly what it refines into. As it stands the tool tip shows tiny icons that are monochrome, so you can't really tell at a glance what the item is for. Get ready to take lots of notes.

Sometimes you can place things in such a way that you cannot get to them in order to work the resource/crafting station to build, or take out a zombie, etc. That's bad design. 

Not being able to see zombie building efficiency when they are in most crafting stations. It'd be nice to be able to see that at a glance. Overall I have no gripes about the zombie aspect of the game other than that. Everything else is able to be easily understood or worked around if you do a bit of studying.

Not being able to upgrade some crafting stations that are the same size without breaking down the original one and placing the new one is more than a little obnoxious. It's also weird that some crafting stations are automatically placed, and some you can only have one (I'm looking at you Zombie Winery).

To touch on something problematic that is both building and story; The way that furniture is placed in the church, particularly before and after upgrading the church is completely broken. I didn't spend a lot of time researching it, but it seems like after your first church upgrade you straight up cannot place certain furniture items, which keeps you from upgrading the quality of your church. For instance; I found that there is nowhere to place Confessionals after you upgrade past the first iteration of the church, and the ones I luckily placed early were still there even though the spot I had placed them wouldn't fit them any more. Also, not being able to place stained glass windows in... the windows? I feel like if you don't upgrade the church in a particular way you might really hamstring yourself in that regard and not be able to do anything about it. Very bad. 
 
Now on to the DLC. Let me first say that the DLC overall is not worth full price, period. However, if you find it on sale for 50%+ off it's worth it. It's not $10 DLC, sorry but it's just not. The content is fun (very fun in some instances), don't get me wrong, but it's not enough to justify $10 per. Some of it also seems unfinished or not fully realized. I would however recommend that if you're just starting this game it would be worth getting the DLC at the same time as the core game. 

Now my gripes about the Dungeon and combat aspects of the game. First off the combat is simple and easy, that is fine. I'm totally okay with simplistic combat and mechanics. I do wish that the dungeon would repopulate, and I also wish more levels would be unlocked by questing and the DLC. Very disappointed that this aspect of the game was neglected. I would like to see more monster options, more armor and weapon options. I'd also like to see more areas overland with monsters and maybe animals! 

That segues onto things I wish were in the game. I wish the RPG aspects were fleshed out more. The dungeon is woefully underused. I'd like to see a few key stats. Like Strength, Constitution and Wisdom that effect your damage, health and energy that can be raised through the tech tree and items (weapons and armor) and temporarily via potions and such. I'd also like to see more armor and weapon options with stats and effects (Lightning Hammer!). Nothing crazy, just simple would add SO much to the game. 

I feel like if those last things were added to the game in the DLC it would bring new life into the game! 

So overall I overwhelmingly love this game, but it has flaws. Even so, I'd recommend it for people that read the description and enjoy this type of game. Go ahead and buy it! 👍👍👍👍👍",1693877997,1693884526,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

the menus are some of the most sophisticated i've seen in a game such as this. they're automatically organized, most items stack, and you can move items in bulk to storage without having to select every inventory slot with that item in it. not to mention that crafting with the items in trunks in the area is a huge plus. 

speaking of crafting, WHAT A SYSTEM. it's so in-depth. not only do you have to craft your own tools (and maintain them by sharpening them when their durability runs out) and collect resources, you then must process the resources into different materials so that you can craft items. while this may be mindless busy work for some, it really adds to the game for me. i really feel like a guy stuck in another world trying to get by while i find my way back home.

there's so many mechanics from the standard mining, farming, fishing, combat, etc. to unique ones like performing autopsies, digging graves, creating decorations for the graves, cremation, preaching at the church, crafting prayers, etc. it's very expansive, and it always feels like there's something to do if you don't want to progress the main story line.

the theme of the Church is present throughout the game, and i feel like it's a very tongue-in-cheek criticism of the Church while also having you participate in it. it's very well executed, in my opinion.

  Throw that body in the river! Desecrate thousands of corpses. Manage an army of undead people. No matter any choice you make the story doesn't change. 

Tech tree
  This is the most complicated part of the game and is one of the only mechanics that wrong choices could make your game grindy. My advice if you make a poor choice and your frustrated either start over or ride it out. I recommend doing a little wiki surfing to see what goes into what so you don't miss techs.

Money 
  In Game
    Another point of grind. Just take all of the ""business opportunities"" there are and don't feel bad it might take a bit to raise the funds to do certain things but early base game there are alternatives to buying some items.

  Cost of the Game
    I bought this game on sale along with the DLC and I would say that its worth it even at full price. The story shown though Stranger Sins, the revolution of our comrade,  and the camp you help in Game of Crone, to the exploration of sins in Better save Souls. Great for low stress gaming with you deciding how to work though the story. The game doesn't hold your hand though all the mechanics but will lead you though quest and story alike. Again using the wiki as you play is a good idea if your stumped with quests or tech.

It still has farming and you're gonna have to do it, but it's more of a side hustle and quest advancer than the main attraction. It's also based on weekdays instead of seasons, which suits the game well. I feel like the game tries to be a lot funnier than it actually is, most characters are fun and quirky and weird in some way, but not really in a memorable or hilarious way. It's a lighthearted game about corpses, I guess. All the different resource requirements are annoying, there's several different tiers of wood and iron and stone, and you constantly need all of them. Inventory space is very limited so I constantly find myself writing down the exact stuff I need, barfing my inventory into a random chest, grabbing the 37 different things I need, and then running back over there to actually build it. At least the teleport stone makes traveling reasonable, having to walk to the quarry all the time would be awful. It's all just a little bit too tedious and cryptic, but it's still a fun and quirky game. I probably enjoyed at least 30 of the 52 hours I put into it.

Original review:
I really wanted to recommend this game, but not for that price.
The game is beautiful, and for the most part functional.  I've not encountered any bugs, but I can tell they exist judging from the forum posts.  There is a nice amount of things to research and build, so that is a plus.

Here is the bad..
The game lacks focus and basic slice of life functions.  Since you can sleep at any time it lacks the daily hook, making each day pass by sometimes unnoticed.   I once had 3 days pass without even realizing it.  it felt aimless because of that, and the quests barely help.   You would think the quests would mount up slowly, but it just lays it all at your feet and you are expected to figure it out.

Speaking of which a lot of tasks in the game are poorly explained from gaining science/faith, to construction.  You can go the entire game without find a construction post for a major part of the game.  Everything feels just so unimportant, and overly complex.

Take for example making a prayer book.  1 componant is a book.  How do I make that?
I need pages, well for pages I need to make chapters, and for that I need pen ink, and for that I need ink.  Ink takes black paint, which needs graphite,  but that I need to decompose which I don't know unless I unlock another function once I find it, which is made from coal on another workstation.  keep in mind I need to unlock the skills for each of these.  Don't even get me started on trying to get a leather potion for the book that needs 3 seperate things made for that.   So this might give Factorio a run for its money, the problem being it don't easily explain this.

My next issue is a bit more nitpicky I agree, but there are many small things that bug me which could easily be fixed.  Simple improvments in the options or UI.  for example if you press the M button for the map it defaults to where you last left it, not even moving to where you are.  if you press the M key again the map doesn't go away.  When you select a new skill in the tree it moves the camera all the way to the start of the tree.

Yes, it's somewhat of a SDV clone. But it comes with a twisted, wry sense of humor. And it's challenging to figure out how to deliver what various NPCs ask from you. It's very satisfying when you have things set up and automated like a well-oiled machine. It takes some doing, but when you figure it out, you feel good about it. No spoilers, but let's same the game gives you multiple options as to what to do with all the corpses that arrive at your cemetery. Heck, this is as much a time and resource management game as it is a farming sim. Not to mention the dry humor that comes along with it. 
 
The base game is top notch. Play through that first. Then, if you're enjoying it as much as I did, go for the DLC.

The art is wonderful and the theme of a lightly darker stardew scratched my itches in all the right ways. But I have 3 main issues with the game that are driving me to write my first ever steam review, I can't even recommend buying it in a steam sale.

First, the game very quickly becomes very grindy. That doesn't have to be a bad thing, Stardew is already all a big grind, and I love me some factory games. But this game doesn't hide its grind, every questline in the game immediately starts off with ""bring me 5 pots"" ""bring me 20 carrots"" ""bring me a beer"", whether its a side character or a main quest line. Add on top of that long travel times around town and the grind becomes very unfun very fast.

Second, the UI is not helpful. There is no centralized place where you can view recipes for items you have unlocked.What if you need to build, for example, an alchemists workbench, which can only be built in the church cellar? you need 6 planks, 3 complex iron parts, and 2 advanced conical flasks, which can only be crafted in the crafting area. So you leave to go to a different area (with the long travel time) and start gathering your resources, only to forget: do I need 4 planks or 6? do I need regular iron parts or complex parts? The only way to check is to walk all the way back to the cellar and go into the crafting menu there. In addition, when you research new technologies, there is no indication where the items you research can be built. If you just unlocked the alchemists workbench, you don't know what items you need to build it or where you need to be to build it. I'm fixating on this building here because it was what frustrated me with the game: I needed the alchemist workbench to advance, and when I finally researched it I found out that before I can build it I need a wholly different item built in a different building I haven't unlocked. Sometimes the UI is just wrong. As my last example, I was trying to get water to use in a recipe. Hovering over water tells you it is produced in a hand mixer. After building the hand mixer and taking a bucket of water over, I find the hand mixer cannot interact with the bucket of water. I look up the hand mixer and the wiki says ""you must study the material at the study table before the hand mixer can make it"", but I can't study the bucket of water at the study table so I look up bucket of water in the wiki and it says ""right click in your inventory and select ""use"" to produce 20 units of water"", so you don't need the hand mixer /at all/ to produce water, you just do it in your inventory which you don't do with any other resource in the game.

Which leads me to the last point, progression in this game is horribly gated. To advance your skill tree, you get 3 different experience points: green points are earned through farming tasks, red points are earned through industry tasks, and blue points are earned through spiritual or research tasks. Right away you notice that green and red points are plentiful, but blue points are nowhere to be found. So immediately your main goal in the game becomes to find some source of blue points. The only way I have found to get blue points is to study items at the study table. In order to study items, you need 2 resources: faith and science. You get ~3 faith once per week by delivering sermons, and there is no other way (I am assuming you can increase the amount of faith you get over the course of the game, just not the frequency). You get science by deconstructing certain items at the study table, but those items are either hard to find or hard to craft. So early game it is very hard to progress just due to the shortage of blue experience, so every blue experience point you gain is precious. Which makes it extra frustrating when you unlock a technology for an item you need, only to find that the item you just unlocked can't be made yet because you need a different technology, so you just wasted your blue points on something you can't use yet when you really need them somewhere else.

I'm sorry for rambling, but I haven't had a game frustrate me like this in a while. I wanted to like it, and it didn't need to do much to satisfy me, but despite having a solid hook the core mechanics of the game make it very hard to enjoy.

The art style and humor is amazing, and I think the premise is extremely creative, but the execution is just lackluster. The controls are annoying and hard to tweak, and the game is poorly designed. To be more specific, distances are vast but walking is slow. On top of that, sometimes it just feels like paths aren't intuitively designed and you needlessly need to circumvent something to arrive at your destination.

This game is one giant fetch and grin quest. Don't get me wrong, I'm a Monster Hunter fan so I LOVE grind, but this just isn't the ""fun"" kind. As for the fetch quest critique, it feels like there is one railroad-y track and you need to either get on board or your entire sense of progression comes to a screeching halt-- as opposed to a game like Stardew Valley, where you can always table one quest or part of the story/game in lieu of another. Basically, the entire game revolves around delivering items to different people that each come on a specific day of the week. If you miss that day-- tough. If the game had a bit more going for it in terms of things to do that feel like tangible progress and the layout was designed just a bit better, I would really love and be willing to sink a triple digit hour amount + DLC cash into it.

- I wish the map was better, like there are symbols for each thing but there is not a key for the symbols (so you have to guess what each symbol means and remember it)
- I originally did not see a reason to unlock paths to the quarry because I did not know it existed
- The way the grave system works (where corpses get unhappy via too much dissection) was not explained well, even with the tutorial section in the ESC menu
- I wish items at least stacked consistently in this game (ideally I'd prefer stacks of 100 for absolutely everything but at least they should be consistent between items)

The story is interesting with a good sense of humour and a variety of characters but this quickly turns into a series of monotonous fetch quests that test your patience more than they should. To make matters worse, certain key characters only appear on one specific day of the week, meaning you'll have to wait several days before you can hand in your quest item(s) to them.

Some of the quests will briefly mention important dialogue that is only mentioned once and never said again (such as when and where to find someone.) If you are lucky it will provide some information in the menus, but only a sentence at most.

The name of the game later on is googling everything constantly since the game doesn't provide enough information for you to even know what you are doing without prior knowledge. Want to unlock a new technology with limited points? You may not even know what the technology does or if you have the prior requirements to use it. Invested your points incorrectly? You will have to grind them out all over again to unlock the technologies you currently need.

I once got a quest from a lady at the Inn to get some perfume for her. The game suggested with dialogue I could either acquire this from the Innkeeper's wife or make it myself. Hilariously the game just straight up lied as it's impossible to make it yourself. I would not have known this unless I checked the wiki and could've wasted hours at the alchemy bench trying to make the perfume item.

If you do end up playing be sure to buy the teleport stone from the Inn as this item can be used infinitely and has a short cooldown. No mention whatsoever of it being infinite use in the game. Even with this item there is a LOT of walking around in this game. Lack of information/guidance is a reoccurring theme in this game.

The combat is pretty weak, worse than Stardews. It is largely non-existent until you unlock the dungeon as you'll typically only see enemies at night in certain areas.

Most enemies are passable but their hitboxes can be weird and the bats are incredibly obnoxious to fight while also making silly wooshing noises repeatedly. There is no audio/visual feedback as to when you take damage besides your health bar going down which is kind of bush.

This game does not like higher refresh rates. When running on my 280hz montior there are the occasional weird stuttering/graphical glitches that sometimes occur. Forums suggested that setting your monitor to 60hz fixes these but this shouldn't really be a problem in the first place.

After investing 18+ hours I feel I have unlocked a large majority of the base game's content and mostly just feel disappointed. The game could be much improved with a UI overhaul and more information readily available (even something as simple as an in game item wiki/guide). Despite being 5+ years since its release the game feels unpolished.

Save your sanity and consider passing on this one. If you are interested enough to buy I recommend only getting it on sale.",1693109861,1693109861,False,27,1,0.66210561990737915,0,True,False,False

When I got this game, I expected to be spending a lot of my time dealing with corpses and the graveyard. Instead, what I got was a game that actively tried to keep you as far away from the graveyard as possible, memorable examples being:
[list]
   [*]The fact that corpses are (as far as I've been able to tell) not delivered on a consistent schedule at the start of the game (even the wiki can't tell).
   [*]The quest that requires you to make and tend a garden through at least two harvests in order to continue receiving corpses.
   [*]The numerous quests that need you to travel across the map to talk to one person after 6 in-game days.
   [*]The tedious walking distance between locations (granted, a teleportation stone is available from the first vendor you meet in the game relatively early on, but this is never indicated and it has a very limited destination set).
   [*]The entire process of making grave decorations (which, by the way, seem to be limited to only fences and markers) being offsite.
   [*]Just the entire grind of gathering resources in the first place (see: other reviews), with the only resources that don't matter being the corpses'. Hell, the game encourages you to sell corpse meat, and then gates it off [i]immediately[/i].
[/list]

Furthermore, while saying that a graveyard is lifeless is like saying the ocean is salty, there's nothing to the graveyard's atmosphere that makes it feel like an actively-used cemetery. No flowers appearing on recently-placed graves, nobody wandering the tombstones looking for a deceased relative, not even some small randomly-generated blurb on each tombstone giving the barest details of the entombed.
Finally, on the often-mentioned grind: so few resources feed back into the graveyard that it honestly seems like more of an afterthought rather than the focus of the game. I never found myself doing anything for the sake of the graveyard, more frequently instead just gathering resources to remove some barricade that makes the world marginally easier to navigate.

The potential that this game had to be something really interesting was wasted on a game that completely lost sight of what it was supposed to be about, trying to be another Stardew Valley instead of its own unique world.",1692223236,1693095131,False,20,0,0.649491727352142334,0,True,False,False

It baits you into completing quests (many of which you have to go online to see what to do because it's not explained).
In one word : *Grindy*. 

You spend a lot of time early on getting stuff you need here and there, grinding those tech points (which take a lot of time to even understand how you get them). You're constantly starved of everything and bounce from one NPC to the other.
Midgame you get some economy, manage to advance, and again it's a repetitive grindfest.
Later on, you'd better hope you have advanced with every NPC, because they start relying on each other's progresssion and you really don't want to wait a whole week for a specific day to meet said NPC. Again and again. Was it really too hard to add a button to skip day, fast forward time or whatever ?

As in many farming sims, you can grow hops and craft beer. at first you'll be growing copper-star hops and crafting copper-star beer, and selling it for a minor profit. Later you can make some quality fertilizer and upgrade your hops to silver-star. Now you're making silver-star beer and selling it for a larger profit. Then, later, you get the last quality fertilizer and upgrade your beer to gold-star. Now you can sell for maximum profit, right? WRONG! no one buys gold-star beer! It's unsellable! hope you didn't upgrade all of your hops to gold-star at once (like any sane person would), or you're screwed!

Another example: Several of the crops have almost no use for the copper-star version. You can cook them into food one at a time if you want to navigate the cooking menu every time. (many things can be multi-crafted, but these foods? no way!) You can't sell them, or the food you can craft them into. You can only trash them.  Why do they even exist in copper-star form if they're so completely useless?

Strange balance issues. For example: Eventually you can start your own bee farm. But the farm requires so many bees, and the drop rate is so low.  By the time you have enough bees to start a bee farm, you have enough of the other ingredients that you don't even need the bee farm any more!

another balance issue: alchemy. You unlock 'basic alchemy' early on. But you need 2 workbenches that make alchemy ingredients from various items. A squeezer to get liquids, and a grinder to get powders. One was pretty easy to make, but the other one I still haven't been able to make. I've been stuck at this point in alchemy for over two-thirds of my playthrough so far, and I can't do much alchemy at all because this basic alchemy machine is locked behind a piece of tech that's late game. Why???

I hear some DLC fixes some of these problems in roundabout ways (example: in one DLC you have your own tavern, and you can sell your gold-star beer there), but paid DLC should be optional. The base game should be able to stand alone. If it has problems, fix the problems in the base game.

And some of these wouldn't be too bad, except the game is kinda grindy, and money and tech-skill-points are always in short supply. There's nothing like spending most of your money on a raw material, spending a while crafting/farming/whatever it up into a product, and then finding out it's almost useless because no one will buy it.

(In my case, I started on the Steam Deck and my Windows is blank)...

  actually torture.  
-UI/Inventory System is unnecessarily cramped and forced to take up 1/4th of the screen.
-Actually dog water ""tutorial"", be prepared to google everything.
-The fishing couldn't be less intuitive especially given the fact it doesn't tell you have to watch your 
  characters wrists not the bobber (not that it tells you anything)
-The calendar/day system using similar looking symbols is just confusing so that you never remember when

There is not proper game mechanic explanation in-game and this results in you being able to blow hours in frustrating ways as you try to accomplish all the tasks. I wrote a rage-quit review and then came back to the game. See below.

I bought this game on sale for $4 and I still wouldn't recommend this shit. I'm beyond furious after having wasted 11 hours on what started off as a pleasant experience. The game functions like most others in it's genre of crafting/sim/builder. You show up, you have to start doing menial tasks, gathering resources, and expanding your tech tree to access more things in the game. The system holds up strongly for the first few hours of gameplay before hard-cucking you with blue experience points. The tech tree is unlocked via these blue experience points along with green and red xp. Green is gained by doing things in nature, such as chopping trees, gardening, picking flowers, etc. The red is gained through manual labor and is very easy to gain along with the green xp. Blue xp, however, is ""spiritual"" xp and is gained initially by producing hemp rope. But only after unlocking the church and building the required table to do this at. There is also a 6-day week system in place where each day is roughly 10 minutes IRL.

The issue is that you gain 1 blue xp per batch of hemp rope and you need a minimum of 5 blue xp to unlock basic functions in the tech tree at first (with some needing 100+ later). Each rope batch requires 4 hemp which you can grow via gardening or purchase (but good luck ever having any money to use). You can eventually use paper to write notes (after unlocking the desk) and gain more blue xp but I gave up at this point. After going through the infuriating process of growing enough hemp (which takes a couple in-game days) and barely gaining enough to unlock the desk to craft paper, I was stonewalled by needing ink. Fine, I guess I'll get ink. Except that the guy who sells ink only shows up one day a week and just to walk from your home to the location he is at takes about half a day. Keep in mind you have to wait through the full 6-day week if you miss him, which is at minimum 30 IRL minutes. I missed him so I checked the tech tree and saw I could craft ink if I unlocked it. I just needed another 5 blue xp. Fine. I go through the process (via spending every coin I could) to buy hemp seeds and hemp itself to speed up my wait. I finally unlock the ability to craft ink only to find that all of the materials needed, save for 1, were unavailable to me. That's when I fucking rage quit. 

I wasted at least an hour or more trying to get some fucking blue xp to gain the necessary tech. After you unlock the first few items requiring blue xp, the cost goes up to like, 20-50 blue xp and more. I just don't see why the game devs decided to disrupt the pacing of the game and tech unlocks by hard-locking you with blue xp that is not easily gained at all. There's one option to start and it fucking sucks. Followed up by more hard-locks where you can't gain the shit needed to use the improved methods to unlock more blue xp. It's just fucking stupid. If I didn't have 11 hours in this game I'd return it for my $4.

** UPDATE **

Ok, so after calming down I came back to this game and allowed myself to submit to the grind for the blue xp. I have to say that this is still absolutely one of the weakest parts of the game. Though I would like to amend my prior statements regarding why this game is overall weak, though still enjoyable. It really is less about the blue xp and a lot more to do with the absolute lack of tutorials, conversation logs, speed of the character, and the tech tree being fully open from the start. 

LACK OF PROPER TUTORIALS
To elaborate, the worst part is the game has some initial mechanic introductions via a couple of characters as you would expect from most games. However, they stop giving you directions pretty early on. From there the game is entirely about you just running around, exploring, and talking to every character you can to figure out and piece together the story and what to do. This is honestly a great thing for most games like this. However, combined with the lack of conversation logs, the slow movement speed of your character versus the speed of the day, and the tech tree allowing you to blow points on anything, it makes for a terrible experience.

LACK OF CONVERSATION LOGS
What do I mean by conversation logs? I simply mean that when you talk to some characters they will say something to the effect of ""Oh, if you are looking for ___ you should talk to ___. They are near/by ____."" This is great information but there is no way to access it again later. Even talking to the character again doesn't yield this information back. So if you need to sleep, take a break, or just put the game down for a bit, there's no way to remember who is where or what they have and why you need to do it. Now, there is a list of NPCs available at any time with their current quest objectives. But these don't tell you how or where to get those items/objectives. They also don't include a conversation log for reference. This results in the player repeatedly losing track of who is where and what they have because you are juggling 30+ quests for multiple characters at any given time. Combine this with a short day-cycle and needing to make sure you are in the right place at the right time and it becomes very frustrating.

CHARACTER SPEED
Regarding your character speed, there's two things to say here. The first is that you are too damn slow compared to how quickly the day moves. To walk from just your home (middle of the map) to the lighthouse (on the far right) will take about 1/4 of the day (keep in mind characters are only out of their homes during the daylight, so half the day). Simply put, this means that if you are in the middle of a task and realize that the current day is the only day to speak to that one NPC you've been waiting for, you may be screwed if it's past noon. You can run and run but won't reach them in time before they head home. Even if you intercept them walking home, they refuse to talk. The second thing regarding your walking speed is that there is a teleportation stone available to you early on. However, there is no item description on what it actually does and it costs more money than a player would feel comfortable spending early on when you need money to buy food for energy. I kept not buying it, despite my curiosity, so I could instead save money for quest objectives and food for my energy levels. This goes back to my point about there not being a tutorial on all base mechanics. Had the game mentioned what the stone did (allow you to teleport at any time to any visited location), I would have bought it first thing.

TECH TREE
The last piece is the tech tree. This could honestly serve as a silent tutorial for the player had the dev just put a bit of foresight into it's design. The issue is that you can save your xp points for a specific skill, only to unlock it and find out you can't build the table/use the item without first unlocking 1 or even 3 other skills. An example would be unlocking a skill under your Smithing tree only to realize you cannot build the table you just unlocked without having first unlocked a skill under your Nature tree. Things are made worse if you unlock the second skill only to then find out you needed a third skill for that one. This is where I found myself rage quitting the game in my prior review. I shouldn't be able to buy a skill that is unusable. 

Overall I would like to say you can still have fun with this game. I love small indie games and this game has a lot of potential should the dev decide to update these items in the future. The game has charm, humor, and nice pixel art. Just be ready to google everything first.",1692231579,1692653467,False,17,2,0.583642542362213135,0,True,False,False

However, a fun premise and beautiful graphics were let down by a game that seems purposefully opaque - which I can live with as long as the gameplay loop is satisfying - and a gameplay loop that was increasingly frustrating.

I feel like I understand some of what they were trying to do with the gameplay loop. Prices aren't static so you can't just spam the crop that gives you the biggest reward and you can't just go to one merchant and offload a fortune's worth of product. Great. But who buys what and how the prices change makes little to no sense from my perspective as a player. Why does the farmer who sells me produce and seeds ONLY buy produce and seeds?! Would it not make more sense for them to buy things they don't produce themselves? The innkeeper will buy cooked food, but only certain kinds and only at certain qualities.

I am no stranger to playing games that benefit from a constant open Wiki tab, but those games at least usually are playable up to a point and give you enough information to get the basics. With Graveyard Keeper, it felt like the wiki is a replacement for any kind of system that makes information within the game accessible. What tasks do I currently have? I have no clue. I'll have to remember what obscurely icon'd day the character shows up and talk to them directly as there's no way (none that I could find) to check a journal or task list.

I'm also getting bored with the way these games always default into capitalism, but I'm trying not to let that shape this review as 1: I accept that this is just what the genre does at the moment and 2: It literally says in the game description that capital growth is a core part of the game, so it would be churlish to complain about that.

It's just frustrating and I constantly feel like the game puts roadblocks in my way as I'm trying to find a groove and just enjoy myself.",1692646282,1692646282,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

But the crafting is convoluted and not very intuitive. It's ridiculously easy to get resources and stack up points for the skill tree.

It was confusing for the first 10 hours, fun for about 5, and then I felt like I was grinding. You need so much coin to progress a certain quest. It takes forever to walk across the map. 
There is no skill required or leveling up for farming, fishing, etc. 

The fishing mini game is boring and seems like a shoddy version of Stardew. There are no seasons, it just rains sometimes and doesn't affect anything. Seven days repeat one after the other, endlessly.

You don't have to water your crops, they just grow and never rot or anything. Cooking requires no skill either, you just get the recipes from NPCs and you can make them with your endless stacks of supplies. If you die, nothing happens, you just wake up in your house. Your energy runs out but you just can't do anything, there's no passing out. You can stay up for several days in a row, eating your endless crops and meals with no penalty. 

There's a bunch of land but you're extremely limited in where you can place tools and items. You can't decorate very much inside your house or outside either. There are no farm animals to love, or even a cat or a dog. 

This is a me thing, but I didn't like using dead people to craft zombies and gather ingredients. It started to bother me that I was cutting them up. Same problem I had with Prison Architect, where ""it's a video game and not real, relax"" just doesn't work for me. The grisly aspect started to turn me off and I didn't want to do it anymore.

It's a good game with a very interested concept. Some of the issues people discussed have been fixed but not everything. The main issue is that you spend the majority of the game unlocking features and gathering materials and very little time enjoying the main gameplay. It would be more memorable if it focused on the graveyard, church, and morgue aspect. You can spend hours of gameplay trying to unlock one object to fulfill a task that it makes the game less replayable and less memorable. Your first day playing, you get a few tasks from everyone you meet that take most of the game to unlock.

Don't get me wrong, it is fun. It's especially worth it if you get it on sale. For a graveyard keeper, you spend more time working as a carpenter, stone cutter, and farmer than you do actually dealing with corpses. The sidekick you're introduced to in the start, the skull, is silent for 90% of the game. The NPCs are all there just to sell you things and buy things from you.

The only major flaws I see are with the UI and frame rate. It's been 5 years and they haven't implemented an active quest marker on the map, an arrow, or even simple window on screen that tells you what you're supposed to be doing. The other issue I have is with the skill tree and recipes being grouped together in a sliding left to right mess instead of being completely separate like in most games. Again after 5 years you'd think they'd fix this, but they haven't. I don't really know what's going with the frame rate stuttering a couple time or the music just repeating itself like it's going to crash. The specs say even a potato can play it so who knows. With all of that being said I'm still recommending it because the fun outweighs the weird issues that should've been fixed already.
Also, all of the hours so far have been on the Steam Deck running the latest stable build. Just a warning for Deck users, for some reason the game launched into 640x480 resolution instead of the the standard 1280x800.

Resource gathering is pretty buggy, where you have difficulty trying to acquire them due to F button option not registering at times.

Try to put in 50 or more carrots into crate, yet the donkey still doesn't give you the corpse even those he needs 5-10 carrots. And I had no corpses lying anywhere.
Then there is a couple of cutscenes that are bugged as well like the one with the guy who arrived while hiding in a corpse bag, which forced me to repeat the same day all over again.
Resource gathering of logs and those mineral slabs are also very awkward. I dunno who you can only carry one log or slab at a time all the way back home with no other way that isn't so completely awkward to do (like making some pretty weird train of logs and slabs and trying to push everything back home).

There are so many prerequisites to crafting anything, that by the time I get all the items I needed, I've totally forgotten what I needed them for.

This game is a soulless, half-baked attempt to ride the coattails of Stardew Valley. The game design is constantly frustrating - the game itself offers minimal information on how to progress, forcing you to constantly check the wiki for information on what to do. Progression is irregularly paced, forcing you to save up for weeks of ingame time to buy expensive upgrades before being able to progress with the story. There are some items that you can only initially get from quests before you are able to craft them yourself (of course the game doesn't tell you this).

The map is big and overly spacious. You spend a lot of time running back and forth looking at item requirements for crafting in different areas of the map. Many of the NPCs only show up on one day of the week, meaning that you have to wait long periods to complete quests. It can be frustrating to be close to completing a quest the day that they arrive and then have to wait another week because you didn't meet the deadline. This is compounded with the ingame sleep system not allowing you to wait/kill time. You can only sleep in order to recharge energy, meaning that your character doesn't have a regular diurnal sleep cycle. If you need to wait an ingame week to turn in quests, you have to do a week worth of work.

The writing is nonsense. I don't know how much of this is because of the poor English translations, but none of the characters are interesting or appealing. The English version is full of typos. The main character just keeps parroting ""How do I leave? I have to get back to my love!"" to every NPC you meet. There are some weird political stances shoehorned into the game, like the lazy donkey ""from a left wing farm"" who goes on strike and stops delivering corpses.

I sank 8 hours into this so far because, frankly, the gameplay loop and upgrade system is addictive, but not in a satisfying way. It is a shadow of a better game. I have constantly felt frustrated with the game and have been asking myself why I was still playing something I'm not really enjoying.",1692485774,1692485888,False,6,0,0.560000002384185791,0,True,False,False

Long version.
Is this a story RPG? A builder? Medi-eval business sim?  I don't know and I don't think the coders behind this wanted to decide either which unfortunately makes it a bit too messy for me to stick with.  

The game tries to force you into pursuing quest goals right out of the gate, which I have to say, I had zero interest in pursuing and as soon as I could stop following them I did, trying to treat this game as if it was the Stardew Valley of Graveyard Sims : build stuff, farm things, profit - with the option of questing as a side option. Except you can't really do that.  You are very limited in what you can sell and who you can sell it to, so while I was able to invest in the tech tree and open new crafting options, I was unable to pursue this very far because the tech tree is gate-kept by following quests. Unfortunately it took me like 20 hours of gameplay to find that out , a good chunk of that spent googling how to do things because the tutorial element doesn't really cover anything meaningful.

Short version, I built things, couldn't sell those things, and couldn't pursue the things I was interested in, unless I was willing to invest significant time in things I had no interest in.  So, this game isn't for me - but I suspect that someone with a different mindset and more patience will love the hell out of it.",1692368404,1692368404,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It felt like being thrown into something and you can't make the tools without researching something but then that takes resources you need to unlock by crafting but you can't craft it because you can't craft the previous materials needed.
I had to sell all my stuff early on and buy everything from the blacksmith (axe, pickaxe, hammer) which I think is not how it should go.
I don't like how it throws all these quests at you but with no real progression to get to those quests.

Overall it plays like Stardew Valley, even the soundtrack is playfully upbeat as you lug bodies around and carve out their innards.

If you cannot track about 7-10 different things in your head at once or have a pen and paper next to you, you might struggle a bit with this game. I have found myself in a loop of lists of what to do, where to do it, and crunching time to get it done so I don't have to wait ANOTHER week to be able to fulfil quests and goals. 

This game is good at making you feel overwhelmed quickly, which all good sims do. I was a bit very lost at the beginning and some things need to be searched up to understand where you are going, but it is an RPG and I do like the exploration to get to know your surroundings and what the hell is going on around you.

I haven't played any others like it, and I think my freshness to the RPG crafting genre contributed somewhat to that frustration. I think there's a lot this game could do to accommodate someone like me. 

When I started the game, it felt as though it was steering me to do anything but whats on the box (keeping graves). After the first burial, no new bodies showed up for me to bury. Trying to clear or repair the graveyard was locked behind several technologies. Attempting to unlock the technologies is locked behind actions, which are locked behind technologies, which are locked behind actions, which are locked behind tools, which require specific materials. The dependencies of materials, items, actions, and research do not inspire wonder or curiosity for me. It makes it sound like work and not fun. 

The final straw that made my frustration bubble over was an attempt at giving a talking skull some beer. It was the only quest I could identify. I went to the tavern in town and bought a beer item. When I tried to give it to the skull, it looked as if I didn't have the beer sitting right there in my inventory. Then I noticed that the beer in my inventory had a small (silver?) star in the top right, while the beer the skull wanted had a bronze star. Why are there two (or more?!) beer items? How does one get a bronze star beer if not at the tavern, where silver star beer is sold? Is there a way a new player could be informed of this distinction before spending all their money on the wrong beer?

I can't tell if this is frustration with the genre or with this game. In any case, game design generally comes with the assumption that someone who has never played a game before can pick up a game and be instructed to play it.",1692220554,1692220554,False,1,0,0.42921796441078186,0,True,False,False

Little is explained and you're thrown into the deep end to figure out the interconnected systems, which is fine to a degree, but I wouldn't advise playing the game without having the wiki on ready access - as the recipes used to craft anything in the game are only displayed while at the station that creates them, which ends up creating needless busy-work in running between stations and where you've stored resources for no real reason.

The DLCs add in even more systems, with continued limited explanations on how they work - again, the wiki is your best friend when you inevitably get stuck.

It's good as a ""head empty, no thoughts"" time sink, but unfortunately falls apart in terms of actual gameplay design, implementation, or enjoyment more rapidly than the corpses decay.

TLDR: Don't go in expecting Stardew Valley with corpses, or Dave the Diver systems progressions; this game is the equivalent of walking into an all you can eat buffet with food you aren't familiar with and nothing has labels - you're just gonna have to figure it out yourself or ask a friend (the wiki).",1692154094,1692154094,False,16,0,0.65173792839050293,0,True,False,False

the donkey is cute and relatable, bless his soul, the only upside to this game.

2/10, Stardew Valley did literally everything better, from pacing to grinding mechanics, to npc design and interactions and humor, to world building, to weather, to map and distances and walking speed, to music, to time-of-the-day mechanics, to energy bar and energy maintenance.
If you are interested in the grotesque atmosphere of graveyard keeper, just download the murder mod on Stardew Valley and play it instead. Same thing, except again, Stardew is better in every way possible.

Farm crops, mine rocks/metal, craft items, the works. 

Eventually, you get into semi-automation, with Zombie workers filling those roles, slowly at first, leaving the Keeper to do fine tuned work. 

However, around the mid point of the game is where you unlock 'quality' crafting with Bronze/Silver/Gold items... and then the manual process of making things really slows the game down. 

If you wanted to make, say, a basic carrot meal, you can just put in an order to craft 100 at once and come back to it later. 
However, if you wanted to make a Gold tier meal, you have to go into the menu, click on Gold, click Make Item, and you have to sit there and wait for one (1) item to be crafted... and lord knows you need way more then 1 Gold meal (or sword, or statue, or whatever else you are trying to craft)

This is a game with similar graphics to Stardew Valley and Terraria. Very easy on most gaming computers, easily can reach 60FPS, or in my case 144FPS with my GPU not even trying. So why on Earth are there so many micro-stutters. Every 3-5 seconds there is a split second stutter. This game has such simple graphics that I really can't believe this is a problem.

I asked in their Discord about this problem, because it was really becoming annoying. And I was basically told that this problem has occurred pretty much since launch, and there is no fix. I tried to adjust my FPS in the Nvidia control panel anyway, down to 100 FPS, and then down again to 60, but that did not affect the micro-stutters.

No, there isn't any hand-holding in this game. You are left to either figure it out and fail or go on the wiki or YouTube. Some people haven't wasted three days in Hugo's House of Horrors trying to figure out how to get in the house and it shows. Tell me you haven't been killed by cultists in Mad Dog Williams literally two hundred times without telling me. I feel like if that level of difficulty isn't for you it's less of a problem with the game and more of a conflict of gaming styles. You have to be of a generation where taking handwritten notes and drawing your own maps is just as much a part of the gameplay as what the developers put into it. 

That said, the base game is too short and feels underdeveloped plot wise. If you don't put a lot of time into resource gather and achievement hunting, if you race to the end of the plot, it's going to be short and unfulfilling. Even taking weeks to play this, reaching the end it was like ""that's all?"" You get out of it what you put into it. It's not about the destination so much as the journey and the journey was spectacular. 

There are DLC packs which I have yet to really get into, but the discrepencies and lack of overlap in mechanics and plot make me feel like I should have downloaded them all first, played the game that way, because playing a DLC after the main game just sort of broke immersion for me. I wish it picked up where the main game left off instead of retconning.

I’ve given this a thumbs up as I personally enjoyed the game. However before buying it, its not everyone's cup of tea. Think Stardew Valley/Harvest Moon but with a macabre vibe, funny quips, a commy donkey, and a biiiig time sink! 
[hr][/hr]
Firstly, it is VERY grindy. It took me 55 hours game time on steam and 334 in game days (55.6 weeks!) to complete. This included having an entire Opera section dedicated to Wiki tabs and planning my next week in game in a word document. This would be my main gripe with the game – you basically require the Wiki, or note taking, to be able to keep track of everything. Unless you have a really good memory over the course of the days of IRL time it’ll take you.

Whilst this is the case, I found it very fun. There is no pace you must play at, and even though my aim was to beat it (certain base game steam achievements are locked behind DLC it seems) I do like to 100% complete games. This will not be one. I’d easily double my game time doing so, and I think I’d be required to purchase the DLC. Which, on that note. Yes the title screen will have adverts for the DLCs & other games made by the company. I personally have no issue with this, as they’re a small studio so needs must. 

That being said, if you enjoy the thought of this game, but are hesitant with the grind, there are mods that you can use to make things more streamlined – teleport stone cool-down removal (and a bigger list), increased inventory size along with global access storage (inventory management across the different locations is a game in of itself!), and other QOL mods such as faster crafting or sprinting would allow for a much less grindy experience without “breaking” the game. 

Overall, I did enjoy the game, and I have heard that the Souls DLC makes the start a little bit easier overall for adding a little bit of complexity in an additional element to the game. I played through the whole thing without DLCs, but I imagine if they are of the same quality, it’d increase the game time to upward of 100 hours!

To be honest it's just one gigantic cope. Sure this game takes time and i just finished the game and wrote this review. I wasted a bunch of time doing quests etc... But one thing in those reviews are true : [b] [u] you will need to browse the wiki at least for the ingredients of potions/and other chemicals. [/u] [/b] It's not really because it's badly made, but it's because you need to combine ingredients until you find the right combination, or grind quests to find the recipes. So yeah if you want to get time, Wiki is the way.

Meanwhile, if you're familiar with that kind of point system (red/green/blue) like ""[url=store.steampowered.com/app/1139980/Travellers_Rest/] traveler's rest [/url] "" it will be obvious on what you have to do. There is also multiple ways to get points like studying items, but one simple thing is to just : craft and delete things ???? I am really amazed at the number of people that grants a negative review just for this. [u] MY DUDE YOU JUST NEED TO CRAFT STONE TOMB FENCES, YOU DONT EVEN NEED THE HIGH TIER ONE, ONLY THE MOST BASIC ! [/u]

As i said, this is one massive cope to just give up on the game and give a bad review. While i clearly enjoyed the game and found it amazing, there are some lacking points. First of all, i gotta agree with the devs name. Updates are really rare, so barely any, if no new content. SPOILER : [spoiler] Even in the Credits, they will litterally meme about not making the Town ingame (you will just get instantly killed if you try to cross and go there). While i understand it was never supposed to be in the game and it's a huge trolling from the team, it's still really disapointing since in the end i find the map rather dull to explore [/spoiler]. 

So yeah, it's a really good game, didn't encounter any bugs, but be prepared to spend time in it to progress, things take time, you got energy to manage, and a shit ton of stuff to craft. 

[u] [b] It's not for the Lazy Fortnite Zoomers that want to jump into concrete things all of a sudden, and that can't bother to craft 10 tombstones to unlock new technologies and blame it on the devs. [/b] [/u]

It is a bit of a grind but that is what im used to when it comes to these farm type games (this is more death farming, but same thing). In the early game you have very limited info on how to do things which is fun to discover the map and people. This is pretty enjoyable as you make mistakes, get lost and have fun talking to the people. Really enjoy the early game. Mid game you finally get money, which isn't as important as you think in this game. And you really start getting a feel for things. You know where everything is at and have a good zombie workforce. (if it werent for the zombies this game would get a thumbs down from me, because the amount of stuff they can handle for you is amazing). The mid game is okay, starting to get a little stale. And the end game is the bane of my existence. Grind grind grind grind. Tries to waste your time just to make the game last longer. The weird thing about this game is the week cycle. all important characters only shown on their day. So you are always waiting on characters to show back up. I officially gave up on completign the game because of just how many times the characters say thanks for helping me, okay come back next week for me to give you the next part of the mission. You can tell they did this just to draw the game out. I stopped playing at 67 Hours with probably 95% of the story completed. If the characters showed up daily then i probably would have finished this in 40 hours, they just really suck up that much time waiting around for them to pop back up again.

Graveyard Keeper has a lot going for it, but unfortunately it buries much of its potential under layers of unnecessary complexity and tedium. After an unfortunate accident, your character finds himself in a medieval village where he is recruited as the new overseer of the town graveyard. While the premise sounds simple enough, the gameplay is anything but as a lot of grinding needs to take place in order to progress.

At its core, Graveyard Keeper is a resource management game and for the first several hours of the game those resources need to be manually harvested. While this grind is common in resource management games, there is usually a payoff for completing tasks or at least some logic justifying their existence. More often than not, the rewards are just additional tasks to complete. The resource system itself manages to feel unnecessarily padded as there are several variations of the same resource that need to be researched and crafted. Trading your newly crafted items can be frustrating as well as the villagers and town feel pretty lifeless. It's often unclear which villager is willing to buy your resources or where you can even find them as several are only available one day a week.

It's frustrating because Graveyard Keeper looks and sounds excellent. Working your way up is satisfying and the game provides a decent sense of progression. Unfortunately, the ability to design and decorate your property is quite restrictive. Your left with a patchwork of zones that fit only specific structures and more often than not you’re layouts will look identical. The result is an experience that never really scratches that creative itch. It’s a title I really wish I could recommend, but its flaws overshadow its strengths.

Although many comparisons can be drawn from such games as Stardew Valley, Graveyard Keeper very much stands on its own two feet. This game will not be for everyone due to the play-style, however, if you are partial to the pixelated farming sim genre and have a curiosity for something a little darker, I fully recommend that you consider adding this game to your collection.

Graveyard Keeper, with its enchanting pixel art, quirky characters, and mysterious lore, offers players a unique and engaging experience. However, after achieving 100% completion, I must admit that my journey through this game was both rewarding and frustrating, leaving me with mixed feelings about recommending it to others.

Let's start with the positives. Graveyard Keeper's pixel art is undeniably stunning, drawing players into a beautifully crafted world. The characters are a highlight, with their fun and interesting personalities adding depth to the game's intriguing lore. Additionally, the pixel splash screens add a touch of visual delight that complements the overall aesthetic.

However, my enthusiasm dampened when I encountered various issues and flaws during gameplay. First and foremost, the game's screen resolution experience was riddled with bugs, causing unnecessary frustration. Moreover, losing quest items and needing to resort to a save state editor to locate them was an immersion-breaking inconvenience.

Graveyard Keeper lacks a comprehensive tutorial, leaving players to grapple with ambiguity and resort to guessing solutions. The slow walk speed also proved tedious, making it bearable only with the aid of consumables. Furthermore, cut scenes kept bugging out, disrupting the flow of the narrative.

Another disappointment came with the presence of items in the game that were purchasable but not usable, leaving me questioning their purpose. The cooking system's broken mechanics, where multiple items with variable quality were difficult to manage, became an annoying aspect of the gameplay.

Reflecting on my overall experience, I found myself replaying the game due to an ""incorrect"" dialogue choice that didn't affect the outcome. This consumed a significant amount of time and left me frustrated with the lack of clarity.

On a positive note, most achievements were achievable through a normal playthrough, adding a sense of accomplishment to the game. However, the potential of leveraging achievements to extend gameplay by setting goals for production, wealth, or alchemy setups was sadly missed.

The game's pricing strategy felt unbalanced, with the base game and its DLCs amounting to a steep cost. Comparing this to other popular titles like Stardew Valley, which offers significant free content updates and a lower overall price, I couldn't help but question the value proposition.

Another aspect that irked me was the in-game advertising for the developer's other game, which felt intrusive and detracted from the experience.

In conclusion, Graveyard Keeper possesses fantastic potential with its unique premise and charming art style. However, the plethora of bugs, missing features, and questionable pricing detract from the overall enjoyment. As much as I wanted to love this game, it missed the mark in several crucial areas. Unless deeply discounted, I find it challenging to wholeheartedly recommend Graveyard Keeper to others.",1690918606,1690918606,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Star Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)

Graveyard Keeper is an absolute gem of a game that takes players on a captivating journey into a delightfully macabre world. From the moment you step foot into the medieval graveyard, you are immersed in a unique and engaging experience that blends simulation, role-playing, and dark humor into a perfect concoction of gaming delight.

The first thing that struck me about Graveyard Keeper was its charming art style and attention to detail. The pixel art graphics are surprisingly beautiful, creating a nostalgic ambiance that harkens back to classic gaming days while infusing it with modern flair. The quirky character designs and atmospheric music enhance the overall experience, pulling players deeper into the intriguing world of the game.

As the keeper of the graveyard, I found myself pleasantly surprised by the depth and complexity of the gameplay. Managing a cemetery might sound mundane at first, but Graveyard Keeper transforms this seemingly simple task into a compelling challenge. From burying bodies and maintaining graves to conducting alchemical experiments, crafting items, and growing crops, there's an impressive variety of activities to keep players engaged and entertained for hours on end.

What truly sets Graveyard Keeper apart is its well-crafted narrative and character interactions. The NPCs you encounter are not mere cardboard cutouts; they are fleshed-out individuals with unique stories and quests that add depth to the game world. Building relationships with these quirky characters proved to be as rewarding as it was entertaining, and the decisions I made had tangible consequences that shaped the direction of the game.

Furthermore, the game's technology tree system adds a layer of progression and discovery. As I unlocked new technologies, buildings, and abilities, I felt a genuine sense of accomplishment, empowering me to explore the world further and tackle more significant challenges.

Graveyard Keeper strikes a perfect balance between dark themes and humor, resulting in a narrative that continually surprises and amuses players. The clever writing and witty dialogue often had me chuckling, making the experience all the more enjoyable.

Lazy Bear Games and tinyBuild have not rested on their laurels since the game's release, as they have consistently provided exciting DLCs and expansions that expand upon the already rich content. This dedication to supporting the game and the community is commendable and ensures that there's always something new to look forward to.

In conclusion, Graveyard Keeper is a captivating and charming game that exceeds expectations on every level. Its unique premise, captivating gameplay, beautiful art, and compelling narrative make it a standout title in the simulation and role-playing genres. Whether you're a fan of dark humor, resource management, or simply enjoy a well-crafted gaming experience, Graveyard Keeper is a must-play that will keep you enthralled and entertained throughout your time as the keeper of the graveyard.

-Very good game, you definitely should get it if you can, the game is kinda grindly but you can just chill and do everything in this game 
-dont care about the 'stamp quest' you can get it for free from npc called Snake 
-buy the teleport stone for the tavern, it's cheap but worthy
-the best starting food is carrot cullets so unlock the farm and buy carrot seed for the npc called Farmer
-there's much more tips but it's kinda spoiling so i will stop here

My play time is falsely high for this game as a lot of what's going on is time padding, did you just miss speaking to that person? You have to wait 6 days for another chance(!!). The layout of the map is just irritating and has been deliberately made to pad player time. Nothing is clear as to what you might actually want to do. For example the last thing I actually did as I kept missing the day over and over again was the quest for the dark organs and being able to see skulls on organs which after getting it would have made the game so much better. This would have been useful to get at say hour 15, as opposed to seeing it at hour 78 as the last thing I did. There's no replay-ability so getting one of the best features at the very end seems ridiculous. 

The automation... I mean what is even the point? The merchant system is next to useless as things just keep lowing in prices. Why would you keep on making any item when it's worth nothing? Just thousands of items sat being unusable. Usually automation is used as integral process or pivotal to the endgame, in Graveyard Keeper it's used to get to end game, but then that's it. There's no end game. Again getting the dark organs at the end meant I missed out on the 16 skull auto zombies, but again would it have even made any difference?

This SHOULD be a positive review, yet here I am not recommending due to the ridiculous design decisions that just hamper the player deliberately.",1690634011,1690634011,False,1,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

There are a lot of similarities between the two, but ultimately I found this game unrewarding and annoyingly paced. I quit after about 16 hours, decided to try a fresh start with what I'd learned, and then quit for good after 2-3 hours.

Review is based off of playing PC version with keyboard.

PROS:

-The map layout is cool, there's some interesting features and variety

-Shortened travel by going through the basement is very convenient

-NPC quests are logged in a tab for easy reference. That said, there's very little guidance about how / where to complete them. It would be nice if you could access the text and pictures of the original dialog / what you'd see if you talked to the NPC (such as the star quality of the fish fillets, for example)

-I like that you don't have to tool-switch; it just automatically uses the appropriate tool for the job

-There's no penalty for using up your entire energy bar, you can just go sleep with no consequences, or keep running around talking to people

-Chest contents are accessible from anywhere on their region, so no need to juggle items through your inventory. IE - if you're working in your front yard at any of the stations, they'll pull from your local chest.


CONS / ANNOYANCES:

-My biggest pet peeve: No way to increase energy bar, and it gets used up very quickly. It's improved by improving tools, but it takes a while to get later game tools - I never got to steel tools and IDK how much they would have improved it. Stripping one corpse uses up an entire day's energy. Want to make few planks? Your energy is gone for the day. I never got to the point of making zombies, which perhaps would have alleviated some of my irritation, but it was really tedious to do just a couple of things and then sleep again, over and over. Food doesn't add much energy and I never got to the point of making energy tonics either. As a related side-note, using items from inventory requires too much precision - you have to click on the exact word ""use"" or it just pops you back to your inventory.

-Inventory is not expandable and fills up quick

-Can't move crafting stations after they're built, and are very limited on where you can place things.

-All crafting stations use similar base ingredients (iron parts, planks, etc) - I would prefer not to have to keep all this crap in every chest, especially given the limited amount of space in any given crafting region, and the fact that chests fill up quickly. It would be nice to swap to an unlimited inventory system.

-Little in game guidance. I tried to play this game without the wiki and it proved impossible

-It took me an embarrassingly long time to figure out that to get water droplets, I needed to ""use"" a bucket of water. I tried to add the bucket to the crafting station listed in the tooltip for water drops, and that didn't work. I just played for hours trying to knuckle thru without any of the resources that require water droplets, which is on me for wanting to play a no-wiki run, but still - annoying.

-Church basement crafting and alchemy is completely obscure. I would have *never* figured out how to make ink without looking it up, especially granted that the order in which you add the components makes a difference. Who knows when I would have researched graphite - it was low on the list, especially granted how limited faith and blue experience points are, I had bigger fish to fry.

-Not obvious which crafting ingredients / components are perma-use. For example, the chisel, whetstone, or pen&ink. After *finally* giving up and looking up how to make ink, I crafted 10 ink, bought 10 feathers, and then just made 10 pen&inks before realizing I only needed the one.

-Faith is a huge bottleneck resource, considering you need to study everything before you can actually process it for alchemy.

-Blue experience is a bottleneck resource.

-It wasn't super obvious who I could sell things to. I eventually figured out (I think) that you can't sell just anything. It has to be something the vendor can sell to you. I made money off of wood products to the wood guy, but my normal MO would be to craft whatever food is easiest and sell that, but unfortunately no. And there's supply and demand and you can't just sell stuff to your heart's delight - their inventory fills up, and stuff gets more expensive as you buy more, and less expensive as you sell more. While this is realistic and I suppose interesting, it annoyed me how hard it was to get financially comfortable (I never did). I couldn't effectively min-max activities in the game, it forces you to generalize, which is fine, but not my play style.

-Fishing was completely un-intuitive / the cues were very subtle, and there was no in-game guidance.

-There's all kinds of other small unclear things. I dug up the zombie's brother. I can't figure out how to reanimate him - he won't go on the resurrection table, and his bro has nothing to say about it even if I drag his corpse over to him. He'll be lying on the floor of my morgue forever lol.

-G*psy is a slur - this needs to be changed in-game.

I'm sure there were other things too, this was just the stuff off the top of my head. 
TL;DR: Overall, it had a lot of potential but the constraints, lack of transparency, and apparent lack of opportunity to improve on those things made the game not fun to me. It's possible that if I had stuck with it, I would have unlocked more stuff that would have streamlined things, but I just didn't want to get there.

Last but not least... If you ever doubt how shit the UI is, go fish. You'll understand how terrible the game's implementation of the fishing minigame compared to stuff like Stardew Valley.

The DLCs that have been added over time though, I feel that they mostly detract from the game overall. Some of them add some nice features, but I think aside from the free expansion that added zombies to the game that allow you to automate various resource collection, the expansions are not exactly a must for the full experience. The stories they add are nice, though largely disconnected from the main story, and just add more and more side things to do that I don't feel really compliment the main game. Also, a lot of the DLCs give you rewards that just allow to flat out skip some parts of the game, making your progress feel hollow and handed to you rather than actually earned; not a fan. Honestly, I enjoyed the game the most by far the first time I played it, back when it only featured the Breaking Dead free expansion.

I really like this game though, it's very chill and unlike similar titles really just has no time restrictions, allowing you to tackle any variety of projects at whatever pace you feel like. It's just that, for a game called GRAVEYARD Keeper, you do very little work in your graveyard compared to everything else, especially when adding the DLCs. I think the devs should have considered expanding the mechanics of the graveyard more with the various DLCs. I think they're done with DLCs at this point, though can't say for certain, but I think if I ever get the urge to play this game once more I would actually just play it without the DLCs.",1573540268,1690344355,True,1,0,0.442028999328613281,0,True,False,False

I see a lot of people compare this game to Stardew Valley, which in itself is a fair comparison, but it falls flat on a few things. 
   First and foremost: this game has a lot more moving parts than Stardew. It's got a more complex crafting system which can be an initial deterrent for people looking for a more chill experience. You need to earn points by chopping trees, harvesting foliage, or doing research to even unlock recipes, which can result in quite a bit of grinding. And on top of that, even gathering the necessary materials to do said crafting is different, as (for example) you have to cut down trees and gradually refine them into wooden planks you can use for even basic crafting. If anything, purely based on the crafting aspect of the game, it should be compared more-so to something like Minecraft or Vintage Story instead of Stardew which has a sub-par crafting mechanics. That being said, the research aspect of it almost reminds me of a tycoon game, which is kinda fun coming from an rpg-esque game. 
   Also, this game's story has you in a headlock pretty much as soon as you boot it up. Not to spoil anything, but it gives just enough ambiguity to have you wondering about how and why you're here managing a graveyard. Having an alcoholic talking skull be essentially the game's version of a tutorial is a very nice touch and adds a lot of personality to playthroughs, as its banter feels more fleshed out than just ""press x to interact"", ""use wasd to move"" as most tutorial npcs are. Plus, although the towns people tend to be very standoff-ish, everything they do fits in very well with the over-arching story and adds a level of believability to the characters. 
   Plus, I mean. It's a game where you work as a mortician who essentially sells human meat. It's macabre. If you're not into that kinda dark-humor, then why are you here? Lol.

TLDR: More complex farming sim with corpses. Lots of grinding, but fun. Nicely written.",1690273492,1690273492,True,44,0,0.820148110389709473,0,True,False,False

The worst offender so far is the crafting of quality items that must be done one at a time. Regular items can be batched but quality items cannot be batched, which quickly becomes tedious.
The start of the game is a bit rough also. If you don't follow an optimal path of unlocking the right technologies in  the right order you'll become stuck for a while. In the sense that your progress will be very slow until you manage to make the required resources to advance.
The quest reminders are very uninformative. When only an item is required, that's easy, unless the way to get that item is not by crafting and you don't remember how or where to get it, then the quest reminder will not have the relevant information. 

if I compare it to Stardew Valley, I'd say they added a few interesting improvements with the contextual tool use and specific tools slot (for the ax, pick ax, etc.). Having access to the content of your chest when crafting is also a welcome improvement. Unfortunately these improvement are a bit undercut by the high quantity of crafting materials and the fact that all chests are not linked to your crafting tables, only the ones that are in the same area. You have to do a lot of moving things around do that you'll have nails in all appropriate areas, etc. 
The characters narrative and dialogs are not that interesting either, and having the various characters buy different stuff, just make selling your things more complicated. 

I think it is a bit sad that this game falls short in the end, because there is a lot to like, but the unpolished features do make this game tedious enough that I couldn't recommend it to someone else.",1690260822,1690260822,False,2,0,0.503370821475982666,0,True,False,False

Not a bad game, did 186 in-game days, mostly offline while travelling, that's why you don't see it on my hours. 

Game starts interestingly, here the Pros:
- nice atmosphere, different setup of all the other managing games
- complex and deep tech tree, many quests
- dedicated devs trying to give you a lot of game for your money, but which turns over time into a Con

However the games fades away over time, due to the following assorted Cons:
- little guidance. l usually don't do much tutorials and want to explore by myself, but here l got stuck several time, had to look solutions on the internet, no choice
- the over time you just get lost in tasks, with no chance to leave yourself a note what to do today. Especially frustrating when you come back after, say, 2 weeks and are lost in your own garden
- tedious gameplay. Loong distances. What starts out nicely and fun soon turns into a walking simulator, and l thought Days Gone was slow.... they give you a teleport stone at one point which saves the game from being unplayable, but this is pretty much it
- controls. or rather non-controls. l wont complain about the cheap C-64 style graphics & animations. But doing stuff is really awkward with these controls, and since the game makes you do a lot of stuff it is a permanent source of frustration. Combat is an even bigger mess. For all involved.
- story bug: spoiler alert, but after 186 days l had to find out (on the internet) that my version has a quest loop between Snake and the Astrologer, which left me stuck in the main story-line, unable to finish the game

So yeah, no hard feelings, l guess they tried to make a long game with a lot of content and they stretched a story out like dough with zillions of badly explained and non-intuitive details that make you read up the game in the corresponding wiki. For all you care, be my guest to give it a go. I started it cause my laptop doesn't support higher games and liked it at first.

I want to enjoy the game, and sometimes I genuinely do, but there is so much unnecessary padding of quest lines that it just gets in the way.

Let me give an example. Many of the critical NPCs only come around one day of the week. You're working on their quest and they get there, you're finally ready to advance the questline, only for them to say ""Great! Now before we can actually do anything, go get me something or other that takes longer than the in-game day that I'll be around for you to complete. See you next week when I ask for something else at the last minute. Maybe we can advance this story after another 3 or 4 hours of actual game time, if you just sit next to your bed wasting energy with your sword to sleep through the days until I come again"".

-The art style is truly beautiful.

-The gameplay is incredibly enjoyable, especially for the first 20 hours.

[h1]Bad points:[/h1]

-The game becomes overly extensive as you progress.

-Although the gameplay is good initially, it becomes increasingly repetitive and boring as the game goes on.
Quest NPCs only appear on specific days of the week, which can be frustrating if you miss them and have to wait a whole week for their return.

-You can't sleep unless your character has no energy left, so, no easy way to pass time.

-The DLCs are necessary as they contain crucial content, but they are quite expensive.

599140,142382803,76561197995730862,0,3,549,0,549,1688970934,"Honestly, I wanted to like this game. I'm very into pixel art aesthetics and anything that hits that Rune Factory / Stardew Valley / etc sort of niche. Unfortunately, the game has a lot of problems with it. 

Let's start with the obvious. The graveyard. You can't so much build your own graveyard so much as you can place down graves and move on. Your graveyard will look like the next graveyard will look like every other graveyard. You gain an upgrade in the kind of graveyard you can make? And you spend the time to switch over all your graves so you can get the bonus scores.

The bodies? Well, you don't so much as respect and preserve the dead so much as you take out various parts in hope what you remove takes away from the bad score and doesn't also take away from the good score. You don't learn how to do it better, you just upgrade your skill so you're less likely to get penalized. But there isn't really a learning process or an order of doing things. You can remove the skin off the corpse after the skull and the blood and the fat, and it makes little difference to the health of the body, so it's not like we're learning how to better respect the dead, more of encouraged to butcher as many bodies as possible. 

Now let's talk the actual plot. You're isekai'd and given no details and told you gotta run this graveyard now. Each character has a questline you can go through, but most of the time, progression is locked behind another character's quest line or your own research. The skull that gives you information? He likes alcohol. You can buy him a beer but then he wants wine. How do you make wine? Well you need to progress a whole tech tree for that, and to get the right points for it, you first need to improve the graveyard so your boss the church man is like "" yeah you can take care of a graveyard. Congrats, it's your church now give a sermon "". At some point, you're just expected to go with the logic, but its not like handwaving the logic makes individual sections more fun.

Anyway, your main sources of blue points are going to be Stone Gravestones or starting up the Paper Industry, and both take forever on the tech tree - after all, wooden graves come first, and you need stonemasonry to be at a certain standard to start making graves, and the paper industry is a legitimate mess. 

and resource gathering? It's very clunky. You cut down trees and get logs that you then need to manually carry over, or you manually carry stone to your stone pile. it doesn't seem bad, except that your walking speed is *so* slow. That's actually I think my main argument for this game. Your walking speed doesn't seem bad until you realize it takes so much of the day for you to walk in a straight line to get from your home to the other side of town. When you learn you can cut that distance down by unlocking a shortcut in your basement, you do it, right away, all other tasks can wait. Even then, I found myself annoyed at how few points were actually a shortcut. I could quickly get to the church, but the distance to my own morgue was annoyingly long even through the shortcut route. You could get to town, but it was a point right on the western edge of town, so when you want to go all the way to the lighthouse, you've only really cut out half the distance. And there's a guy you need to see for multiple missions out there, so you go often.

Now, maybe I wouldn't have much to say about the travel if characters were more available, but as it is, most of the main quests are locked behind characters who literally only appear once a (six day) week. Including that church. That means that you pretty much have to drop everything when a certain day comes if you have the one thing that NPC wants. 

Unlike harvest moon / stardew valley and similar games, there also really isn't much use talking to a character outside of their quests. They have a few things to say, and that's really sort of it, and needless to say, each one has limited screen time and limited depth to go with it.

Maybe the DLC has more to work with, but honestly, playing this just felt like working a second job.",1689738576,1689738576,False,2,0,0.50306624174118042,1,True,False,False

The good the game has going for it is the pixel artwork and unique spin on the farming simulator genre, as well as the ability to automate some tedious tasks. However, every other feature in the game is painfully mediocre, unintuitive, or just mostly useless.

For example, the market system in this game is interesting in the way in functions. Each vendor has a specific item preference they will purchase from you, but the gains for most of them are so pitifully minuscule that it'll only be good enough for pawning off items for small amounts of cash. That cash then goes towards buying important items like seeds or ingredients to progress the game, which sounds like regular progression, right?

Wrong. Because in the market system, most major vendors have 3 tiers to unlock by either constantly buying/selling things with them or accomplishing some tasks. Honestly, by the time you need to unlock some vendors like the blacksmith, you'll be already nearing mid/endgame status that you'll probably be able to produce everything he could possibly sell you. Same with niche vendors such as the woodworking/stone cutting vendors. I've never needed to use them or wanted to use them because just farming the resources they offer is far cheaper than if you'd just bought it, and by the time you get the coin you'd be making everything you need by hand anyways.

Crafting items is equally frustrating if it's your first run through since you have to unlock everything in the technology tree one by one and find out you need a DIFFERENT tech to even have the ability to craft or build the machines or items. It's worse when it comes to game pacing because the game will have you run these main quests and force you to craft specific items for specific people who ONLY appear at specific times. You have to memorize where they appear on what day, what time, when they stay or leave or you'll have just wasted a whole in-game week waiting for them.

General pacing is like this:

Get quest.
Go find a person.
Person only shows up on a specific day.
Person asks for an item far up in your tech tree or requires an annoying amount of grind.
You dont have the item so you farm more tech xp to progress before putting it off to grind some more to grind something else to progress.
Eventually complete main quest, progress again. Repeat step 4, make it more tedious.

Some features like the reputation system in the menu tab is useless for the most part other than to help you remember what person requested what for their quest, what day they appear at, what their status is with you. Reputation is useless for about at least 50% of the minor characters and does nothing for anyone who's not relevant to the main quest. Some people you do quests for, you don't even talk to again, or even need to.

By the time i was hitting endgame and automating all of my basic resources, i was just throwing money at all the ingredients i could possibly handle because i was tired of grinding. The main plot doesn't really keep me interested, and i could care less about most of the npcs in town, there's not much heart to it. 

Alchemy hasn't really been all that useful as you need to either look up guides to save the time and hassle of playing ingredient mixing simulator or just buy the majority of the potions from a witch NPC who sells you everything important enough to progress in the game anyways. Making your own potions just saves you some coins but you'll be making enough to not care about expenses once you reach mid-game anyways.

All in all, the game isn't the best to play if you're expecting a fun farming simulator or just playing for a story. It's just a mid-tier game I won't see myself playing again for a long time after completion due to it feeling like an overwhelming grindfest with nothing much happening.",1689399422,1689399422,False,4,1,0.536507129669189453,0,True,False,False

The alchemy system is great, but just doesn't end up feeling useful.  There's too many components, and most of them just aren't useful at all, or, at best, only for a single task.

Update 7/14/23
So I just finished the game. 

The main flaw of this game and my TLDR: Whenever I worked hard to accomplish something and looked for the reward I would quickly realize that the reward was garbage, a trap leading me to another work sequence, or not nearly as good as I thought it might be,

Is it unfair to thumbs down a game after playing as many hours as I did?  Probably.
Is it also unfair to constantly prank the player with stupid things like withholding church access because you don't have citizenship papers? Absolutely.  
Is it unfair that this game was released and absolutely needed DLC additions like zombies to play it? Absolutely.  

I think its fair to not recommend this game out of spite because after stepping back and looking at this game and the hours I spent on it.... I don't think my time was rewarded.  The game felt unfriendly to me.  The devs pulled the rug out from me a number of times and I'm still upset about it.  There are good elements to this game, but I think it was ultimately a time waste.  I don't even feel free from this game, just empty with a lingering scratching addicting feeling like i want to wring some barely interesting content from it even though I'm done.

Don't play this game.

Personally I do not enjoy sitting there puzzled on what to do every 3 minutes, then get confused on where to find/how to do the bare bones game mechanics like current quests, combat, crafting etc. The in-game hint popups weren't very helpful and I would have to sit on the wiki, google, or Youtube 95% of the time.
Like crafting a stone repair kit, that you need to fix graves which unlocks the church and according to google (cant find in-game where/how to get clay) you need clay, but to get clay you need to have the church already unlocked? I have almost 0 coins to spend buying clay as I have no way of getting money other than death certificates, and bodies come once in a blue moon. Its just beyond confusing and tedious for me and it seems I'm not the only person having this issue? I don't really want to spend hours and hours on a game just to figure out its basic mechanics.

Great pixel graphics, with a lot of detail. Lot of funny animations.

Sound effects are really nice and immersive, the voices are hilarious, and the music is great.

The gameplay is very addictive. In the beginning, you have a TON of things to do, and half of them you don't have a clue of what you need to do or where to find a lot of the things you are asked, so be prepared to read the wiki a lot. Once you get a hang of the tasks, you are immersed into this world, and you can spend hours and hours without realizing. Once you start automating things with zombies, things start to slow down, and the game gets a bit repetitive. Finally, when you have all your machines and stations automated, it gets really boring and repetitive. Still, getting to that point takes a lot of time and effort, so it's only natural that in the end there isn't much to do. In the very end, if you want to perfect the graveyard corpses and zombies, it is a bit of a grind and gets really tedious, but the end result is great.

The story is nice, hilarious in some parts, pretty bizarre in others, but overall fits the tone of the world. There are many Easter eggs to other games, and TV shows.

You might read reviews and think that people play this game because it's engaging and fun. Banish the thought. 99% of time of this game is spent
a) walking, as there is no run option
b) holding ""e"" button until it causes pain in your fingers to craft something
c) Watching sermon  cutscenes you can't skip, even though you have already seen them 50 times
d) Waiting for bodies to get delivered/zombies to do their job
No joke, this game caused me to hurt my fingers, as i was holding ""e"" button for too long.

There are so many small bugs that make the game feel unfinished. You expect so much more of the world but instead most of the world is blocked by either DLC content or unfinished content. Again the worst part is the freaking grind. The story is short but gets streched out by needless grinding for resourcess.
Another annoying thing about this game are the items. So many items can only be used once in the story and never in the actual gameplay. For example: The bucket of blood. It is used ONCE. You can find it in the dungeon and even craft it but you will only use it once. You can't get the blood out of the freaking bucket so it is utterly useless. 

Many of the quest are also annoying. Most of the time you need to craft or collect a very specific item. The item is almost always way ahead of your progression in the skill tree so you can't progress the story for a very long time. Another freaking shitty quest is when you need to collect 12 gold for some piece of irrelevant paper. You are basicly told to grind in the most unfun way possible. The only positive thing about this game is the potential it had at the start and some funny jokes and references.

1). Creative themes about graveyard keeping in a medieval fantasy world.
2). Fun and light humorous dialogues with many of the NPCs.
3). Great environmental design.
4). Crafting system being in-depth and complex.
5). The sense of no urgency and being able go at your own pace.
6). The DLCs opened a whole heaps of beefy content.

Overall, I would highly recommend this game. If you are wondering which platform to get, I would strongly suggest to get the Steam version because of the faster loading time that you will likely have (as opposed to the Switch version). 

The other important thing to note is that the DLC: Better Safe Soul, is not out on Switch yet (at least, not in my area Aus/Nz). So for the base game + all DLCs, it's definitely worth the price.

I write this review not out of malice, but to hopefully raise some eyes to what feels like some notable flaws to the game. It very well could be that I'm bad at farm-sims like this, but I feel my points may have some merit to them.

[b] Pros: [/b]
- Art: Very good visual design of the world and characters. No complaints in this department
- Music: Refer to art, just very well done across the board, sounds and looks are top notch.
- World: Mysterious and confusing at first, the game felt to be going at a smooth pace of explaining what was happening in this world, and how you could help the people of the Village recover.. but it was also this point that I started to see the flaws here.

[b] Cons [/b]
- Pacing: Easily my biggest complaint about Graveyard Keeper is the pacing, and this ties back to the world. Initially the game felt very manageable and fun, learning how things worked, how to keep up with each of the other Villagers to progress in the main story, but it felt to me just as I unlocked the church is when things felt to compound and collapse in on itself.

I found out that I was able to unlock 'zombies' in this game, undead servants to supposedly give me a hand across my properties.. but I was painfully informed by the game that I didn't unlock undead servants, but rather I had unlocked the ability to unlock undead servants. No big deal, I can just unlock that then work on getting this one free zombie situated somewhere to help me out.. as it turns out, I needed specialized equipment to allow the zombies to be able to work in the chosen field that I wanted them to. Instead, I attempted to take my zombie to the Big Tree north of the church, to which I had to build its own station there. Yet, the Undead servant at the tree only cut the tree, it did not move the logs.. I would need to either remind myself constantly to check back on the tree to pick up logs and bring them home, which would only add to my ever-increasing daily chore-list, or save up enough faith, and make a Resurrection table to make a second zombie.. of which at this point in the game, only -just- having unlocked the church,

Faith was the rarest and most valuable resource in my possession, and apparently Studying was a factor of the game I hadn't realized the sheer importance of; using Faith, the Blue Tokens (their name slips my mind) and a material (that thankfully wasn't consumed during studying), I could learn more about the material and subsequently apply it in recipes... I hadn't realized the necessity of this, however, as you cannot simply 'play the slots' by trying to combine different items into an alchemy table until something works, you were required to study an item before you could use it in a station.

All of this, unfortunately, isn't even brushing up against the pressure felt having to keep up with the storylines of NPCs and how they intertwined with one another, keep up with your food supply so that you could work for more than five seconds on some crafts, and keep up with the weekly sermon, which despite not giving very much money at first, seems to be your best (or most consistent) source of money in the early game. Sixty in-game days in, thirty in-game days after I unlocked zombies and still only had one chopping at a singular tree, my frustrations got the better of me and I'd decided to uninstall. I hung in for as long as I could to persevere through what I was experiencing as the difficult mid-game, but tedium finally broke me.",1689104908,1689104908,False,3,1,0.523622035980224609,0,True,False,False

* Ads for other games and DLC ALL across the main menu.
* Needless complexity right from the word go, with too much to understand and not enough time in the day to actually learn any of it, with only more complexity being added with every single step of progression.
* Game doesn't even have functioning resolution options which, for a game made as recently as 2018, is a complete joke.

Every in game day is just grinding. Grinding resources, grinding skillpoints (of which there are three different types, which all come from different sources) to unlock new skills to grind more resources, grinding food items because your energy runs out like it's late for the prom, which itself takes even more energy to create.

Quests cannot be finished without attaining certain items, which cannot be attained unless you're willing to spend money buying them (which you have barely any of anyway), as they're locked behind skill-gates that you cannot access until being a higher level... but you cannot reach that level without finishing the various quests first.

And as almost every other review states: playing the game with the wiki open is a necessity. Virtually nothing is explained, the game expects you to figure out everything through trial and error which, when it takes so much work just to grind up the necessary items in the first place, is an incredibly hostile attitude for the game to take towards the player.

Ultimately it feels as though the game just isn't valuing your work or time. I picked this up because it looked, in all honesty, like 'Stardew Valley' except with a graveyard instead of a farm. And yeah, there's obvious influence and inspiration everywhere you look in the game, but it bogged itself down with way too much grinding, too many different things to keep on track of, and pushing the player forwards way too quickly, adding layers and layers of extra work and complexity whether or not the player is actually ready for it.",1689087767,1689087767,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
Absolutely loved this game. I've already spend so many hours playing this, and I always catch myself playing more than I wanted. The art style is great, I love the whole idea behind the game, and it's completely up to you what you want to focus on or do in the game first. However; while I do recommend this game, I also have some things I would like to see improvements in: 

× When I bought the DLC's all together (because they were on sale), it instantly opened up all the new quest lines and areas in my already existing game, giving me WAY too many tasks/things to do all at once, making me feel a little bit overwhelmed. Mind you, I wasn't even halfway through out the original series yet. I personally would've liked to see the option to manually start the specific DLC's by e.g. chatting with a specific NPC where they ask you for you help. This way you can accept or decline their questline when you don't feel like starting this specific DLC yet. 

× Also, you get very little to no help through out the game. While I am not a big fan of having to google things because I want to explore games myself; I found myself completely stuck because I had no idea how certain things worked, which items to get, or who to talk to. I would've liked to see a little bit more effort when it comes to explaining certain skills, quests, where to get certain items, or how to craft them. 

But other than that: Great game, and I love it so far!",1683744904,1689023829,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Anyway this game is GREAT. It's like a morbid Stardew Valley game, is really the best way I'll describe it.
""Capitalism: The Game"", is what I heard it lovingly referred to as, and I think that it's such a good fit that I began to call it that myself. I have a couple of grunts about the game but none worth the mention just that I have them.

Lastly, I think that all of the jokes throughout the game are super cute if you understand them, and the DLC is just as good as the main game and adds a lot of value, in my opinion (of course).
If you are thinking about getting the DLC. Spring on it! It really makes the entire game feel that much better to play it from the start rather than playing through the game and getting those bits of the game added on. Whether you get it before or after a playthrough, I still say it is a good buy.

The quests are so freeform and don't update in the way you'd expect, plus there's no way to pick an ""active"" quest. The very beginning where they give you a quest arrow? That's the only one you're ever going to see. Your position isn't shown on the map. The game does not hold your hand, but so much so that it becomes detrimental. It would definitely benefit from some modern conventions of the genre, which puzzles me as to why they aren't included; we did away with vague directionless questing and obscure mechanics to make games more accessible and play smoother, but this game brings all those archaic hurdles back to life in force, and many people have had similar issues with vagueness and directionless wandering. 

Resource collection is a nightmare, as you can only carry a single log or rock at a time, and you'll quickly clear out all the nearby resources, and your character only has one speed (slow). The unlocking/tech tree is expansive but unnecessarily so; you have to unlock how to cut down a small tree, a big tree, a dead tree, etc. which serves no purpose but to pad out the already arduous grind for materials.


I want to keep playing to see if it gets better, but I'm spending as much time in the wiki as I am playing the game which is rarely a good sign. If you loved Oblivion and had no problem keeping track of where you are, where you were, and where you're going then you'll be fine.

- After playing for some time, you realize you need to use wiki regularly in order to understand what is going on in the end game, and the official wiki doesn't help that much. It's unnecessarily tedious.

- The stamina system and the day cycle aren't enough to compete with the high demand of the quests. Especially if you buy DLC's along with the game, they become harder to catch up with.

Let me start by stating some really important things about the game : 

YOU WILL NEED THE WIKI OPEN. 

I see tons of reviews of people who got stuck because they didn't know what to do next. This game contains very little direction in terms of what to do. You might need an item for a quest, and the only way to get said item is some hidden NPC selling it and the game will never tell you. We can argue wether or not this is a flaw of the game, but if you plan on playing it, don't make the same mistake other players did. I myself tried to do it on my own and fared pretty well for a while, but about 10 hours in had to give up and look up some things on the wiki.

THIS GAME IS SIMILAR TO STARDEW VALLEY, BUT NOT THE SAME

The basic concept is the same. You have a plot of land on which you can do quite a few things, there is a town with npcs you can interact with, the overall ambiance is relaxed and warm. You have ""chores"" to do to progress in a multitude of ways. There are some objectives, but at the end of the day you could just stay in your spot and do whatever you want. No pressure or stress to complete any kind of objective.

The difference with stardew is the progression. In this game, the primary means of progression is through a tech tree. Through certain actions of certain nature, you unlock specific science points that allow you to unlock technologies to unlock new items or crafting stations. These items you ear are usually needed for quests or quality of life improvements.

The npc system, in my eyes, is actually better than stardew's. In this game, most npcs have quests for you that are part of a bigger storyline, and when you complete a quest for an npc you earn reputation with them, allowing you acces to certain services or dialogue options. This feels far more interactive and fun than stardew's friendship system. This is , in my mind, probably one of the only thing this game does better than stardew.

If you liked stardew valley, there is a decent chance you will enjoy this game. They are similar, but have some fundamental differences.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now let's talk about the game itself. You start off as a regular guy who dies and goes into some strange other dimension and become a graveyard keeper. There is a graveyard, and a steady flow of bodies to the graveyard, your job is to embalm them and bury them, burn them, throw them in a river, whatever. That is the basic premise.

A part from this, the main underlying quest is our character wants to go back to the real world, and every npc you meet usually gives you quests when you ask them for help. Those quests usually require you bringing them items or accomplishing something.

The quest system is pretty fun. You meet npcs, they give you quests, and you try and work to complete them. What is nice is a lot of npcs tend to get intertwined with other npc's quest lines and I just find it overall fun and interactive.

This is where we get to the main feature of this game : the tech tree. Your actions in the world earn you tech points that allow you to learn new technologies. These technologies are usually to make you stronger, more efficient at certain tasks, or allow you to create new crafting stations or items that can be required for certain quests. The tech tree makes this game, ""complex"", for lack of a better word. Often you'll need a technology for a quest, but then you will need another technology to use that technology, and you need another technology for that one, and so on and so forth. You can find yourself in some pretty deep rabbit holes sometimes in terms of what you need to do. Personally, I love problem solving and therefore this part of the game, but it isn't for everyone.

The game includes things such as fishing, farming, mining, combat and so on. Later in the game there is the ability to automate certain tasks and make your life far easier.

The overall tone of the game is a curious one. Not in a bad way, just special. At it's core it's pretty macabre, you bury bodies that you often remove chunk from prior to burying them. You can take out from the body and make a burger with it, or sell it at the bar with an illegal royal stamp so it looks legit. Anyone analysing this kinda feels like this is messed up. However, it's all presented in a light hearted funny tone with nothing being graphically explicit. Personally, I love this tone, but some people might find it strange and unamusing.

The graphics are great. They are nice looking for 2d sprites with nothing groundbreaking.

The game has two big issues for me. First of all, the mandatory use of the wiki. Pretty much everyone who doesn't use the wiki will get stuck and uninstall the game. USE THE WIKI. I personally don't mind this, but some people might.

The biggest issue in my mind is the price tag. This game, at it's current default price, is in my eyes too expensive to justify buying. It's good, but not that good.

The game currently sits at 20 USD. To me this game is probably worth, at the most, 13-15 USD and 20 is kind of pushing it. I was able to get it at a 65% discount for a price of 6.7 USD and for that price it is a complete steal.

TL:DR : This game is pretty great but too pricey. I recommend getting it if the price falls below 15 USD

Lots of wandering around hoping you run into something useful, only to find out that you have 2, 3 or even 4 chained chores just to unlock something small

COMPLETELY stuck behind blue points for unlocking any technology for hours and no idea how to proceed.  Even when people online say how to get blue points you find you can't do it because you don't have the technology.  Seriously frustrating catch 22.

Almost nothing is explained.  The fact that I keep having to check reddit and the wiki means you failed to teach the players even the basics.

I've tried to like this game but I spend more than half my time walking or carrying logs etc.  Constantly running out of energy makes the game tedious as well.

One thing that can be a bit overwhelming is all the tech trees and NPCs that only come on certain days, but what I really love about it is that you can really focus on just whatever interests you in the moment and can always do everything else another day, especially when each day belongs to a six-day week cycle with no big concern for missing out on getting some stuff done in the current week.

Sound design is annoying at times, especially speech but luckily developers left an option to disable it. Story-wise and world building it's not bad, even good at times but all that is shadowed by tedious grind.

Not only there's a lot of grinding but game keeps adding complexity just for the sake of extending that grind. So you spend unhealthy amount of time just grinding for resources so game can enable you to grind some more. They added zombies as an idea to keep annoying grind away, but then they require more maintenance than you doing everything by hand. So many things are like this. Hundreds of ingredients and you need to grind for ALL of them. You have absolutely no ability to set up some sort of economy and focus for example only on blacksmitting and buy the rest of the ingredients. No you must research and grind each resource in the game. So you end up being a farmer, blacksmith, alchemist, priest, warrior, doctor, hero, lumberjack, fisherman, a witch... EVERYTHING. And let me tell you, it's not fun especially since it's painfully obvious they made the whole thing slow on purpose so you have longer play time.

Prepare for a lot of slow walking, grinding then walking multiple times to bring back those items. Yes, you have an ability to put 24 full sized human skulls in your pocket but unable to carry more than one rock or part of tree. And most annoying resources are the ones you need the most... so be ready for some serious walking.

There is sOOOO much content and stuff to do in this game it's nuts. Tons and tons of progression, things to work on and do, a titatnic load full of quets and story stuff to get into.

I highly suggest getting this game whether it is on sale or not, and getting all the content DLCs when you first get the game because they all actually add to the content when doing the main game so it just makes it more fun and absorbs you even more.

Now it doesn't give the best tutorials, which is totally fine - its a 'figure stuff out' kind of deal most of the time. Just make sure to always go through EVERY dialogue option that NPCs have. I struggled for a bit because I thought certain options where just 'repeat' dialogues of what they told me before because of what the title for it was saying - but eventually found out that isn't the case and you need to go through them all to unlock certain things. So make sure to talk to everyone if you ever get stuck and youll be fine.

10/10 - amazing game, and my gawd, there is still SOOO much they could do with this game.

The characters are good and fun (love the donkey).
The game is fun at the start but gets very grindy and boring very fast. I think the biggest issue is not having proper tutorials for all the crap and mechanics you have, so it can get very frustrating and hard to understand  but once you search the wiki/watch a video/ it gets better (all things i shouldnt be watching or making if im playing a fucking game), the problem is that you get flooded with mechanics very fast and is the core of the game loop, wich i found is flawed and not realy adictive like i dunno stardew or  travellers keep (wich is a EA game and already have better game loop/mechanics).
The movement is very sloww and it have some bug issues, in my 9 hs i got bugged like 2 times 1 of them i was sure i was locked and needed to restart the game (luckly i found a way to fix it). 
As far as i know by reading news and other comments/reviews, the devs promised another dlc, but some time ago, they say the game was finished and done, so no more dlc or bug fixes, wich sucks because the game need more bug fixes. 
Last but not less important they droped a ""new update"" so everyone was hoping for fixes but no, the new update was just an ingame add for the new game they are making, and that suck.

SO:
 is it bad? no is not.
is it good? meh..is fine
is going to get better? no is not.

get it on sale cheap you will get a decent amount of fun for that price.

I really want to love this game- I like the concept, I like the art, and for the most part, I like the game. That said, I've just barely delved into it, but already found things that made it hard to enjoy. My biggest issue would probably be the crafting system. It seems like this is a vital part to the gameplay and yet, at least for me, it is a nightmare to deal with. It's mildly infuriating to grind through different steps (gathering resources, unlocking tech, etc) only to unlock the blueprint I need and find it requires a new resource that leads to another cycle of grinding for the materials and tech. It just gets a little grueling when all I want to do is progress the game and move on. If you like the slow burn type of resource management game, then by all means, this game is for you. However, I find it a little tedious to keep backtracking and grinding for materials. Having multiple craft tables for different sections is also a little annoying. I get having the organization aspect to it, but if I want to craft multiple things, it's a hassle to be running from place to place if the things I need to craft can only be crafted at certain tables.

I don't wanna go on and on about the little things because I truly do love this concept for a game. i'm all for it hands down.

Graveyard Keeper has become a hidden gem in my eyes. The amount of freedom you are given in this game is astonishing. Being able to do what you want when you want makes this game one of the best ""indie"" titles on the marketplace. It has so much going for it and the DLC expands on the base game tremendously. 

[h1][b] Pros [/b][/h1]
⚫There is a lot of things to do, a lot of areas to explore and a bunch of NPC's to meet with ranging quest lines to complete for each of them.
⚫You have to build up and manage your graveyard by burying corpses. Digging the bad ones up and removing organs to remove RED skulls and replace them with white skulls. While you are doing that you also have to build up your church to gain faith.  
⚫There is a dungeon to explore in your basement which adds in the combat part of the game.
⚫You can fish, forage, mine, chop wood and much much more.
⚫The game has 4 DLCs that expand on the game tremendously. The base game is good but the DLC's make it so much better.
⚫The first DLC is ""BREAKING DEAD"" (FREE) which adds the ability to have autonomy with Zombies via a resurrection table. (You also figure out why you cannot enter the town with this DLC)
⚫The second DLC (paid) is ""STRANGER THINGS"" which came out in 2019. This DLC adds the ability to open and run your own TAVERN which adds so much more to the game. You produce food and alcohol and sell it here which makes you money. That is not all the DLC does, it delves further into the game's lore and the characters you have already met. It also gives personalities to many of the previously-silent villagers AND a new ending to the game.
⚫The third DLC (PAID) ""Game of Crone"" came out 2020 adds even more story content. You build up a camp of refugees that are hiding from the inquisition. While building up this camp you have to investigate a mysterious vampire terrorising the villagers plus some bonus content with the donkey - VIVA LA REVOLUTION!!!!
⚫The fourth DLC (PAID) ""Better Save Soul"" released 2021 is the final DLC for the game. In this DLC you get to explore the ""SINS"" of the corpses that you have been given the entire game. It adds in 2 new NPCs Euric and Smiler. This DLC also offers new ways to improve the quality of corpses and adds remote control to some of the crafting stations.

[h1][b] Cons [/b][/h1]
⚫The UI is sometimes clunky. No explanation to ""look back on quest logs"" e.t.c. So if you forget something... you forget something. 
⚫The combat is a bit lacking. No dodge mechanic or anything. Just hit spacebar to swing, swing, swing - consume potions of health and energy - Repeat till you win. 
⚫The Autonomy of some of the zombies broke for me. They did not deliver the items I told them to. Instead they just broke walking back and forward with nothing on them.
⚫The game without the DLC's is just a bit ""barebones"" for my liking. You can only work in your graveyard and church. Meet the original like what... 10 important NPCS and the rest can F off. Meh... 
⚫Working in my graveyard I encountered one very annoying issue - I could not work on the grave-sites as ""there wasn't enough room"" to work. 

[h1][b] My Verdict [/b][/h1]
Graveyard Keeper is an amazing game with ALL the DLC. If you do not buy the DLC I would not recommend the BASE game as it just feels so boring but with all the DLC its an amazing play. 8/10.

https://youtu.be/AgYqhd_ZS4I
Quick text review:

You were hit with a car and transported to a low tech, dark, medieval fantasy world and get to own and take of the local graveyard... using it and the surrounding area to produce what you need to get back to your beloved (Essentially a farm sim where you perform autopsies):
-Nice, detailed pixel art style (Can have an abundance of bright-ish grass)
-No character customisation
-In fact very little farm/ graveyard customisation as almost everything you build and place has a functional purpose
-It's very straight forward in terms of crafting and progress as craft trees are divided into smaller trees instead of big ones
-You don't really try and become with friends with the townspeople either... they have a relationship bar but that fills up when you complete specific one-time quests in a linear fashion
-It's system for automation (zombie labour) feels ultimately easier to use than other complex examples
-All this leads to a farm sim that, while beefy, is quite a bit shorter than others in the genre (Straight forward)
-The game actually has a discernible end too and pleasingly to get there you need to complete quests that require you dabble in pretty much all aspects of the genre (Crafting grave stones and church maintenance, earning money, combat, even cooking and [u]some [/u] fishing) so there is less that feels neglected 
-Combat is simple as tends to be the case for farm sims
-Nice, dark, sombre yet calming music

Practical Concerns:
-Great value for money (R0.91/ hour for me - $ and £ values in video)
-OK download size (1.5 Gb on the hard drive)
-Easy to run
-Not really kid friendly (autopsies)",1688064748,1688064748,True,0,0,0.296336203813552856,0,True,False,False

Usually I ended up googling ""How do I get RESOURCE"" and getting the answer from Reddit or an article because the fan Wiki is kind of bad. 

I like Graveyard keeper a lot. But this came very close to being a ""do not recommend"". 

I like the goal of the gameplay loop. I like the way the tech tree works. I absolutely love that you can sleep whenever you want during the day to get your energy back. 

I'm very use to playing games with a wiki open. I have thousands of hours in old school rune scape, a game where it is culturally considered mandatory to read about content on the wiki before trying it so you can get a good gist of what to expect. I use the stardew valley mod that basically puts the wiki in the game. 

Graveyard keeper feels like it knows that players will use wikis and went ""Neat, less work for me.""

It felt like every time I unlocked a new tool or ability I was frustrated to find out that I need a new surprise resource I've never even heard of to use it. [Looking at you science] And a often times it wasn't anything I had seen referenced or mentioned in game by anyone, meaning I might as well just google ""How do I get X"" or ""How do I make Y"" because the game hasn't even given me the smallest hint as to where to start with it. 

So many times I've unlocked an early game progression path only to find out ""Don't worry about this. You still have to go unlock 2 other things to use this. See you then."" Which just makes you want to hit your head against a wall. I would have just picked to progress those two other paths first if I had known!

I'm going to keep playing. I'm enjoying it, I'll just be defaulting to the wiki a lot sooner instead of trying to figure out anything in game myself to be honest, which does take a little of the magic out of it.",1687927641,1687935308,True,91,0,0.875916719436645508,1,True,False,False

There is a wide range of resources for crafting and processing across different categories, as well as a sizable world map to travel and explore. While the map may not cover an entire planet or continent, having a village and a few surrounding areas is sufficient for this game.

The game is considered simple in terms of character control, which doesn't differ much from old-school action games. However, it is quite complex in terms of game mechanics, making it challenging to learn and understand. There is also a lack of proper tutorial or introduction, requiring players to figure out many things on their own and even necessitating multiple game restarts during the early stages of play.

There are some plot holes in the storyline which contain irrationality and inconsistency, and they are not even solved in the DLCs.

There is no New Game Plus or post-ending save file available, which would allow players to perfect things in the final state of the story.

If you like chores and constant tasks, this game is perfect for you. It's like Stardew, but if you always had a quest telling you exactly what you needed to do to progress. 

The teleportation stone makes traveling -slightly- better, but you will find yourself walking around from task to task for 80% of the game. There is no run button. 

Faith is a desperately needed resource early game, but the only way to get it is once a week, forcing the player to languish, completing basic tasks and building up inventory until the next sermon. 

Faith is also needed for most crafting recipes that award blue skill points. Almost every skill tree ability requires blue points. I was extremely frustrated, always trying to find more blue points and googling how to get them, while drowning in red and green points. 

Remembering what every person in town buys and sells is realistic, but maddening. Some merchants are pointless, selling basic early game materials you can pick off the side of the road. Others are ESSENTIAL, selling highly specific items for very expensive prices. 

The game does not explain concepts, forcing the player to research how to unlock areas or crafting recipes. I did not discover the quarry (a hidden spot very far away from your house and an essential area to the game) until I was twenty hours in.  

The star system for item quality is obtuse. How higher star crops and materials are obtained is not explained, and the benefit of using higher star items is ludicrous, making low tier items meaningless.

It's not as easy as Stardew Valley and the interaction with NPCs isn't as present nor well written. It's not a game for everyone, but each time you acquire a new technology or unlock the next part of the main story, you feel rewarded for your hard work.

At first, it seemed like a cool idea, but the gameplay quickly becomes repetitive. It's basically like, 'collect 5 things, go here, grab 10 things, go there, make 7 things, go here.' And then you have to do a bunch of tedious fetch quests for the NPCs just to advance the story or get them to like you more. 

And there's so much walking. If you want to go between your little underground rooms, you have to spend a bunch of materials to clear the way. however, you can't even do that until you're halfway through the research tree. So, for the first 8 hours of playing, you're stuck walking at a snail's pace between your crafting benches. And if you forget to bring something with you, well, get ready for a long walk back.

it's not really like Stardew Valley despite what some people say. It's just plain tedious. You just gather and craft stuff, all of which drains your stamina for no good reason which just slows you down even more.

Overall an amazing game for a cozy play night!
though if u dont play the game continiusly you may forget the quest you are on and there is no way of checking dialogs again. So u may be stuck with: ""get 'bla-bla' from 'that guy'!"" but the dialog in between is missing that u have to do a certain thing first.

I finished the skill tree and now have only quests left, just waitin for the day, turns out i miss something and then you check the npc and they tell u nothing, only npc sheet with quest headliners.

If you dont mind using the wiki for recipe and quest deadends, you are good, otherwise you probs loose interest soon",1686744228,1686744228,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Once before any DLC was even announced let alone released and then years after when everything has now been released. If you're looking to know weather or not to by it then I will make this clear. Only buy this if you TRULY and PURELY enjoy chore work. This is not a game you buy to have fun, it is not a game you buy for interesting storytelling, and it does no one thing great or I would even say well enough to stand out or on it's own. Base game is kind of goofy and fun with it's dialogue and even quirky characters but really need to drive this through everyones head so that im not misunderstood here and that this game is 98% chore work, and 2% combat. Every action consumes energy and it is not uncommon to wake up use all your energy to cut some logs up and less than 20 seconds later you go back to bed because you cannot do anything else today because you are not able to. It doesn't help that all the main people you will do quests for you can only see and talk to once every week so if you complete there quest and you are 2 minutes late and they start leaving because it is too late in the day then you must wait a whole nother week to talk  to them again. The amount of things meant to absorb as much of your time and energy in this game is staggering and all 100% intentional. This is not a game designed for fun but instead made to keep you busy, busy, busy. Even with the Stardew Valley inspiration here with the fishing, relationship system (kind of), exploration, and even combat it is all designed to make you think that what your doing is fun but after awhile realize your not even properly compensated almost ever if at all for anything you do. It doesn't help that at the start of the game certain things you need to be able to use in order to get tasks done are locked and it is never properly said on how to get certain things going so that you might also get going and getting. The DLC does nothing to fix any of the issues in the game and even goes so far as to further slow down the player with more you need A to get B but without C you can't get A and D will actually come before G and ect. One DLC in particular ruins the fun and funny vibe altogether with a more dark and sinister overtone that I thought needlessly killed off any of the fun or innocence of the base game and feel that all the DLC actually takes away from the base game in every way. Will only recommend the game as something you buy when you need to keep yourself busy and distract yourself. And ignore anyone saying the devs bailed on the game and won't respond to anything that is completely untrue and they even helped me with something that I was having trouble with to so once again thank you devs. I appreciate it.",1686722224,1686722224,False,2,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False

I love this game; normally I don't like farming/crafting sims bc they're too cutesy for me, but this has just the right level of macabre. Also, there's a self-aware quality to the story that gives it that little twang of satire.  The fact that you start out as a normal, everyday human from a world that [as far as I can tell] is a lot like our own and end up transported to a world where magic exists and summarily saddled with the important and sacred job of graveyard keeper is just the beginning.  I've played with both keyboard + mouse and with controller, and the controls are easy to master and intuitive (also when you approach something you can interact with the game gives you the appropriate key/button to press). I have only one complaint: the way to accomplish a lot of things are just impenetrable (and I end up looking up a fair few things on the wiki). For example, when you first meet the fisherman he wants you to collect some moths for him, but no one tells you how to do so. I spent an hour or so walking around looking for them, until I finally went to the internet to even learn how to get them.  I don't want the devs to spell everything out for me, but perhaps they could make it a little easier to find the answers to some things that aren't intuitive.

I highly recommend this game! I have spent hours on keeping my little homestead, as well as the graveyard and church (I appreciate that there are some options to not make the church overtly xtian, and I'd like to see more of these) in working order! There's farming and fishing, gathering and cooking, building tools and workspaces, puzzles and mysteries, and some dungeon delving!

I am a huge Stardew Valley fan and like grinding in a game, as long as you feel rewarded later. That's one of the main things here: there is no reward. You can see I haven't played that much because this is how long it took for me to see that nothing was coming out of this.

I already have about 8 different characters that I have to take something to them and am very lost. I unlocked several technologies that I can't use for some reason and the game doesn't guide you along at all. For example: I've unlocked the technology necessary to plant grapes. I have enough grape seeds (which I got from the merchant: first time I bought the wrong amount of seeds, then realized too late and couldn't get back to him in time, then had to wait a week just to buy 1 more). I made the vine trellis, and still the game won't accept my grape seeds. No idea why, no explanation found. Another example: I need silver star fish filets and can only get normal fish filet. Do I need to practice more? Is silver just based off of the materials I used to craft something or is there a progression in abilities? I have no idea because the game gives no explanation on the basic mechanics of how quality works here.

Then I process a body. You take out organs and stuff and suddenly you have a low quality corpse, whatever that means. You put something back and that makes it worse, you put something else back and that makes it better, again, no explanation on what you're supposed to do and what exactly you need to think about when choosing what to remove or put back.

What annoys me the most is that I am accumulating so much stuff that I gather and plant and make, but nothing to do with this stuff. the NPCs sell you everything and buy almost nothing. The thing a villager just sold to you can't be sold back to them. I have so much produce and random foods that I've made and no way to make money off of it. The only things that are easy to sell are the wooden and metal materials, which I have no reason to sell because I need them. I also have meat from corpses which can only sell after I get a stamp. I remember the bartender explained there was an illegal but simpler way to get it, but I can't remember because at the time I was doing a bunch of other stuff simultaneously and I can't get him to repeat the information and who I was supposed to get that stamp with. The game is poorly written and not enough work was put into finding ways to make the grind worth it or making the game clear for first-time players.

I feel stupid playing this and maybe I am, I can't tell anymore. People can tell me to look up guides and the wiki, but I like exploring a game for myself first. Except that seems very difficult here and every time I start the game up I can't remember the 5 different fetch and deliver quests I was working on and what exactly was missing in each one.

There are few things to note:
- The story have some interesting surprise and expanded further with DLC stranger sins. Thought it's not fully utilize, as there are some hole remaining
- The gameplay loop have few optimization issue. Not game breaking and can be solved by mod but still something to note
- The end game... let's just say the endgame is complete dive compared to early and midgame. Especially once your 'helpers' get the wheel turning, you've got nothing to do
- No continuation after you reach the ending. Once you done, you done. no save game+ or anything like that which is understandable but untapped potential

Because for the first 3/4ths of the game, I would have given it a positive one. I enjoyed this game for the first three quarters, even despite it's many flaws. Hell, I was even considering picking up the DLC for the game. But then I reached the last 1/4th of the game, and the game itself... didn't. Everything I had been gradually building up since the beginning of the game, had suddenly become completely pointless. All the technologies and recipes and dark magics and whatnot I had been building up and improving more and more for most of the game- including the titular graveyard- most of it just immediately ceased being useful. For the last quarter of the game, the game just sort of abandons everything apart from a handful of dull fetch-quest chains needed to reach the ending. Even the remaining unresolved plot threads were unceremoniously dropped (and the game actually thought it would be funny to lampshade this during the ending); it felt like the game just stopped caring, and thus so did I. I pushed through the extra-grindy nature of the game, expecting everything to eventually pay off in the end, and it just... didn't. I felt like I had completely wasted my time. I still pushed on to reach the ending, but I just didn't feel any satisfaction from it. Ultimately the game just feels unfinished, which is made more awkward considering it has multiple DLC expansions.
But that pretty much sums it up. You spend 75% of the game grinding for resources and technologies and whatnot, expecting it all to eventually come to a head, only for most of it to be abruptly dropped like a sack of moldy potatoes by the time you reach the remaining 25%.",1686121352,1686121352,False,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

Brew potions, conduct questionable experiments, and even perform an autopsy or two. Who knew becoming a master of the macabre could be so much fun?

Oh, and let's not forget the wonderful characters you'll encounter along the way. From sarcastic talking skulls to slightly deranged villagers. They'll keep you entertained with their absurd requests and witty banter, ensuring that you're constantly chuckling in your crypt.

But beware, my friends, as even in the land of the undead, time waits for no one. You'll need to manage your time wisely to keep the graveyard running smoothly. Juggling corpse disposal, crafting, and exploring the eerie surroundings might seem daunting, but fear not! The game's comical charm will guide you through every step of the way.

So, if you're tired of the mundane and yearn for a game that makes you laugh at life's inevitable end, Graveyard Keeper is your ticket to comedic burial bliss. It's a delightful blend of management, humor, and questionable ethics, guaranteed to keep you grinning like a skull on Halloween night.

There's a lot of complaints about the game not having very clear directions but I think that is a feature. You figure out how to get items you need naturally as you progress long as you're patient. It feels very rewarding when you finally unlock something you need!

I think this is a great game with a pretty good story. I also think all of the DLCs go well together and are worth the buy. The art book is just an extra to show the rough drafts of the game but I think it's pretty interesting and worth a look as well.

Skip-able cut scenes 2. item collection collision when crafting or gathering. That really annoyed me when I would be pushed off a crafting station or gathering node while trying to interact with it. 3. No recipe book to track materials with outside of being at the stations for crafting. The alchemy stations would benefit from that change. We can make paper, notes, chapters, books, ect but somehow cant make a recipe list. 4. Spelling errors in the conversation text in game with Yorick. 5.Duplicate recipes being offered for sale after being purchased from Ms. Chain. 6. It would be very visually pleasing to have the UI element for our Character, Tech, NPCs, Map, ect be displayed in something like our own Keepers Journal.

Get's a little grindy at times but you're given tools to help reduce that, as well as plenty to do so you don't need to grind all at once.

Personally I prefer this over Stardew Valley with all the extra quests, humor, and no daily time limit. As long as you have energy you can keep going, no passing out. 6 day cycle that moves fast enough you're not tired of waiting for the right day for the right person, but also slow enough to get what you need done each day, and prep for the next.

But that's exactly the type of game that [i]Graveyard Keeper[/i] is. The pixel art is beautiful and highly detailed, there's a deep crafting and resource gathering system, an expansive tech tree, and some novel mechanics that make it stand out from other [i]Harvest Moon[/i]/[i]Stardew Valley[/i]-type games. But making progress is such a painful grindy slog that I always come away feeling like the game is wasting my time, and the plot and characters aren't nearly strong enough to save it from that.

Here are a list of some of the annoyances I've come across:

[list]
    [*] You basically need a wiki open when playing this game. The introductory tutorials teach you the basic systems, but there's no in-game reference for which materials are needed to craft which items, where to get certain quest items (e.g. oil for the donkey), how to generate certain important resources like science or blue tech points, etc.
    [*] The economy is very slow and grindy, not only in terms of money but also the other aforementioned resources. Some items, like seeds, need to be purchased from vendors, but it takes a painfully long time to eke out the money you need to get the seeds. If this is supposed to be a satire of capitalism, they've certainly done an effective job of capturing the quandary of needing to spend (and, therefore, [i]have[/i]) money to make money, but it's not fun.
    [*] The writing is not good. This is partly a translation issue, as there are various spelling and grammar errors and strange turns of phrase, but that's not the root cause. The characters are one-dimensional, the Isekai plot structure is clichéd, and the dialog all feels very unnatural. After a few moments of initial confusion, the protagonist just passively accepts the strange world he has been thrust into. This is sort of explained by one of the NPCs telling him not to draw too much attention to himself or he'll be considered mad, but his relative nonchalance still makes it hard to suspend disbelief. I feel like this plot element could have been used to greater effect, or otherwise just omitted.
    [*] On a similar note, it feels like the protagonist and by extension the player has no agency in this world. The Steam description for [i]Graveyard Keeper[/i] mentions ""facing ethical dilemmas and making questionable decisions,"" but after five hours the only actual choice I've been given was [spoiler]whether or not to befriend the inquisitor[/spoiler], and it's not clear what if any consequence that will have. In order to progress the innkeeper's quest, you [b]must[/b] [spoiler]sell him human meat using a forged quality seal[/spoiler], which is pretty unethical to say the least, but there's no choice in it. This might actually be required to complete the game; I'm not sure. At best, not doing it will handicap you.
    [*] The game takes a very long time to load when you launch it. What is it doing? Mining Bitcoin? Sending my data to the FSB? I'm being kind of facetious but I really can't understand why a game like this would take so long to load. I was playing on Steam Deck, but there are many AAA games that load faster than [i]Graveyard Keeper[/i] does.
[/list]

If you really like farming sims like [i]Stardew Valley[/i] then you might still enjoy [i]Graveyard Keeper[/i], but at the very least I'd recommend getting it on sale instead of paying full price.",1685668708,1685668708,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I REALLY want to recommend this game as a 'messed-up' dark humor version of Stardew Valley; especially since there is a farming element that becomes important later on. You will enjoy the many chill elements of resource gathering and developing your graveyard; while you also manage a morgue, a church, and a farm on the same plot of land. 

However this game does NOT hold your hand at all. I have spent more time puzzled and watching youtube guides to gather some of the most basic essential resources that the game doesn't explain to you how to find them other than you need them. For instance, blue spheres are required for certain research in the tech tree - and they don't explain one bit that you get those blue spheres by using the research bench located in the basement of the church you probably won't visit because nothing prompts or encourages you to. I've spent more time googling things about this game than successfully figuring these things out on my own. 

Crafting is the highlight of this game, it has a very intricate crafting system and can be very satisfying once you figure out what you want. But almost every single item requires a google search in order for you to figure out what the correct path is to obtain said item for a quest or personal goal. Many times you won't know the technologies you'll need to research to support you in crafting said resource. Again, not very user friendly.

I enjoyed my time playing this game when I'm actually playing it, but I know at least half of my time playing this was also stuck with my head in a guidebook on my phone trying to figure out what I was doing. Nearly 20 hours of gameplay later, and it's still the same.",1685620983,1685620983,False,5,0,0.495328307151794434,0,True,False,False

Also the fact that they didn't bother actually implementing The Town insults me.

I believe that they probably chose a bad game engine or had some similar problem so that they couldn't adapt easily. Because it looks and plays very similarly to Stardew Valley - just with much less content. 
It also has some visual glitches in the dungeon and the Snake and Astologer quests seem soft locked.

The story telling and game flow are also a bit strange and unpolished.

Step into the role of a graveyard keeper, and prepare yourself for a delightfully morbid adventure.

The game's dark and whimsical setting immediately grabs your attention. As you take charge of a dilapidated graveyard, you're tasked with managing its operations, including burying bodies, crafting headstones, and maintaining the overall aesthetics. The macabre theme is beautifully balanced with humor, creating an experience that is both quirky and enjoyable.

One of the game's strengths is its wide range of activities. Graveyard Keeper offers a plethora of tasks to complete, from farming and fishing to brewing potions and conducting autopsies. The variety keeps the gameplay fresh and engaging, allowing you to tailor your graveyard and character's progression to your playstyle.

The crafting system in Graveyard Keeper is deep and rewarding. With resources gathered from the surrounding areas, you can create a diverse array of items and structures, expanding your graveyard and unlocking new gameplay possibilities. The progression feels satisfying as you unlock new technologies and improve your skills, providing a sense of accomplishment and growth.

The game also features a vibrant cast of characters, each with their own unique personalities and storylines. Engaging with them not only adds depth to the narrative but also presents opportunities for quests and meaningful interactions. Discovering secrets and uncovering the mysteries of the game world is an exciting aspect of Graveyard Keeper.

Visually, Graveyard Keeper presents a charming pixel art style that suits its dark yet whimsical atmosphere. The attention to detail in the character designs, environments, and animations adds a layer of visual appeal. Combined with a fittingly atmospheric soundtrack, the audio-visual presentation enhances the immersion and creates an enjoyable gaming experience.

While Graveyard Keeper provides a rich and engaging experience, there are some areas that could benefit from further polish. Occasionally, certain mechanics may feel repetitive, and navigating menus and interfaces can be slightly cumbersome. However, these minor drawbacks don't significantly detract from the overall enjoyment of the game.",1684785885,1684785885,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Honestly, I had a feeling all along that not everything was finished, so they left out some improvements - Town as such, unstoppable productions, unskippable cutscenes, etc. but somehow everywhere there was the feeling that they wanted more but couldn't fit it in.
Obviously the Stardew Valley influence is there - but that's okay, the basic story was cool. The problem is that in the midst of all the grind, it was hard to ""connect"" with the NPCs - who, by the way, didn't really treat me differently once I had established my relationship with them. I didn't like the quest system, the goal was often unclear and I had to scroll through the wiki a lot to find out exactly what they wanted.
Many times I felt that certain upgrades and events had more smoke than flame - for example, I was well prepared for the cathedral upgrade, then so much changed that I was running around making candles every day... From about halfway through the game, the money loses meaning, there's not much to use it for, tech points too. In that respect, the game's economics are a bit thoughtless.
I ran into bugs and glitches in many places - tree never growing, tech point spawned in inaccessible places, product made going into completely pointless storage, etc. 
Despite the bugs I listed, I highly recommend it, because it really has fun mechanics, good ideas, and best of all, time is never short, if you miss someone, you can make up for it the next week.

There are trainers out there that allow you to walk way faster and speed up time for the obnoxious quests where you have to wait until next week... like three times... to finish the quest (which ends up feeling like every quest after a while), which at least makes it less annoying.

I bought this game recently after a friend recommended it to me. Little did I know then, I was about to find the newest member of the highly-coveted position of favorite in my steam library.

Only a few days after purchasing it, I've already racked up quite the game time, thanks to a throat infection. And considering I normally play more action-packed titles, this was a pleasant and refreshing surprise. 

The beautiful art style and calming soundtrack make it easy to forget about the world and immerse yourself in the game. The goal-oriented gameplay is supported by the careful balance of all the many systems present, so that every action you take is useful, and the ever-growing list of things you could be doing with your time never seems overwhelming, not least because every new goal you find is fun and exciting.

There is no wasted time in this game. Any work you do to progress a specific system will become a foundation that will allow you to reach a new goal further down the line. And any time spent doing literally nothing is time spent basking in a relaxing and pleasant world that you have contributed to.

The many mechanics are presented to you slowly, one at a time, such that you have enough time to familiarize yourself with them, so you don't get overwhelmed. This is something I've only recently come to appreciate, courtesy of the youtuber Josh Stryfe Rayes, who showed me the value of a carefully crafted tutorial (shoutout to his channel).

This game oozes quality that comes only from a work of passion. From the beautiful details of the water graphics, to the little jokes and references, it FEELS like you are enjoying something that someone loved to make. And this is, by far, the best part of this game.

In order to actually play the game to the fullest and to not be game-play locked and a bit confused you have to buy all the DLC's. I played the game in BETA and let me say the game has come a long way from that time. Half the mechanics were not done and the game couldn't be complete. And now It even has DLC's. I seriously think the DLC mechanics and missions in the game should have been removed for people who only have base game so we aren't left confused as to why something is grayed out or cant progress further because its DLC. Feels like the Sims. I do recommend this game because it actually ends up having a wholesome message despite being ""adult-Stardew Valley.

I spent quite a few hours of my initial gameplay without knowing the use of a very important item, because it wasn't described properly. When I came across a random post online I realised what I had missed, but it had already cost me a couple hours of gameplay.

It's probably one of the greatest games if you enjoy grinding that rewards you, but seamlessly transfers you to more grinding. It doesn't FEEL like grinding, because you feel instant gratification for achieving the exact thing you were aiming for. You upgraded your church- but now you have new slots to place new things, and you need to get the materials to make those things, but some of those materials require an upgrade in your tech tree, but also you need to get more points to unlock those tech tree items, so you'll move back a bit to find the next item on your list that you can feasibly accomplish and the cycle begins anew.

Super fun, although it tries to do too much in my opinion. The farming, cemetery, mining, combat, trading, dismembering bodies, potion craft, book making, fishing, cooking, cult meetings, witch burning, and other features are all present. It kind of tries at all of them without focusing enough on one element. I could do without the farming or specific potion making while doing more in depth cemetery and church work.

With the dlc it makes the core game much more enjoyable as it gives you various ways to achieve certain goals. It's a bit on the grindy side at times and often you're doing activities that aren't related to the church or the graveyard itself. 

There are a few things that I dislike about the game and the first one is that all npcs follow a schedule and you can talk to some of them only on a certain day every week. A quest usually goes like ""talk to X on <insert day>"", you go talk to the npc and they give you ""quest"" to gather something for them. You gather the object in question and now you *might* have to wait a whole week for that npc. Most if not all quests follow this pattern. It gets old after a while. 

The second thing I dislike about the game is the dungeon. It feels so unnecessary. It's not fun, it doesn't really add anything to the game in the form it currently is in. I think it might be possible to skip the dungeon completely if you have some dlc. The dungeon is just very lackluster and you can't die in the game. When you die you just respawn and you lose nothing. There are no bosses or anything like that. I think the developer wanted to have something along the lines of stardew valley. This was not how you do it.

Okay all the bad stuff is out of the way. I really, really like this game. I think it's amazing and it has a lot of content(especially with the dlc). It'll take you a while to play through.

To those who are thinking of playing this game, be warned. For one, it is nothing like Stardew Valley (if you're seeking a similar experience that is). Although it has a similar gameplay loop, it has none of the satisfaction. 

Each aspect of the game is a tedious grind and and endless wait. Walking? Slow. Crafting? Slow. Quests So... So... Slow. The quests ultimately drove me to drop the game at the very end. It's just such at terrible way to make a story system. Every quest is an idiotic fetch quest for some item, and more often than not you'll have to wait a week or more in-game to get it and return to the NPC, only for them to send you on ANOTHER fetch quest for another stupid item that requires you to wait another week... And the rewards? Nothing usually except to progress to the next quest, or in the worst case, allowing you to finally do some essential task in the game you've been waiting on forever (IE with the inquisitor and the stupid cultist perk).

In fact, if you were to compare this game to Stardew Valley (which it's impossible not to), it does nearly every thing worse in every conceivable way. In fact, lets do a little comparison:

CRAFTING - In stardew it's a simple click, or just place it in your crafting machine and leave it alone. GK? Sit there crafting it for every, single item. Even worse are the quality based items, which you can only craft ONE AT A TIME. Never have I been so upset at not having a simple arrow key to increment a crafting queue. Sure, zombies make this more or less trivial, but not all items can be crafted by zombies, and you'll have to do a ton of it before you can even afford them.

THE FARM - Stardew: Huge plot of land to do whatever you want in. GK: a rigid series of boxes with really only a few options, some of which you have to walk an absurd distance form to even monitor. Most crops are worthless, with only a few being able to be sold as crates. Otherwise more or less a waste of time despite the incredible cost of growing crops (fertilizer is so damn expensive in GK). Also, somehow no animals to take care of. Seriously, you have the sprites already done in the village, just give the players a flipping cow and chicken to take care of.

VILLAGERS: Stardew: They have daily activities, paths, places they visit etc. GK: Same place, every day, not moving, not doing anything. The only way you can make them happy is to go through their obnoxious questlines which requires progression in the game. They're more or less a quest board with a name. Multiples times you will be confused how to even do half of the quests, as they require doing some other persons quest that you have no idea about. Just awful...

DUNGEONS/COMBAT: Stardew: Simple but satisfying, with lots of neat weapons to progress through and fun dungeons to explore. But more importantly, the caves/dungeons are fun to explore and have the draw of getting minerals, gems, etc. GK: A bland, boring dungeon with repetitive enemies, worthless loot and only a few mineral veins. The dungeon is short and even gated 2/3 of the way through by another idiotic quest. It's mostly a waste.

PROGRESSION: Stardew is an easygoing progression where the economy makes sense, the required upgrades are obvious and make for decent goal setting. But for the most part, you can do whatever you like and have fun with it. GK: Gates galore, to the point of exasperation. The heavy-handed way the game more or less forces you to interact with the villagers is irritating beyond belief. And the economy... Oof... Graveyard keeper has one of the most nebulous and strange economy systems I've ever seen in a game. Almost nothing is explained about who you can sell to, what they buy or even how things are valued. You figure it out eventually, but it's a tiring and tedious task to do so.

Anyways, I could go on. TLDR, it's a boilerplate Stardew Valley wannabe that has remarkably good pixel-art, but otherwise does nothing new and in many ways only wrong things with it's game design choices. Only buy this game if you're bored, it's on sale and you've got nothing better in your library to try out.",1683692642,1683692642,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1) Needs more transport spots, like the church, witch hill & swamp (IMO)
2) Characters need to be available more than once a week... cannot tell you how many times I've just missed someone and have to wait an entire week to complete a quest. Really annoying in late game
3) Maybe this is a me thing, but I found a lot of baking/ cooking and some crafting to be useless because I couldn't sell them anywhere.

The visual aesthetics, music, and and general mechanics all feel great at first. But the proportion of grind to content gets progressively worse as the game goes on. Really, the game's fatal flaws can be broken down to 1)lazy writing and 2)grind bloat. 

You get reasonably interesting interactions with a handful of characters, but the writing stops after the first few times. It feels sort of like an author writing the first few thousand words of a novel, then copy-pasting those same words for the rest of it. There are moments where you can make a moral choice, sort of, but these are lost amidst a story that ultimately allows you only one morality. Some will argue that being forced into this one morality (capitalist consumption) is the whole point of the game, and I'm fine with that, in theory; however, I don't think the writing or satire is anywhere near developed enough to justify the lack of choice, or (cue next point) the grind bloat.

The initially smooth game-play mechanics are sabotaged by their own excess. Everything, absolutely everything, takes time. Either you stand there holding ""e"" to run up the progress bar, or you wait on a slow passive timer. Your upgrade trees all lead to more grind, rather than less--even after you gain the ability to automate some of your resource harvesting. And the rewards never feel large enough to justify the increasingly minute busy-work the game demands. Even core elements that should be the most fun, like leading prayers for your congregation in exchange for faith and money, become hollow once you realize your character will only ever say ""Our church is great!"" no matter what sermon you equip, and the projected faith/money rewards will always fall in a very narrow range determined by luck (and by wildly grindy upgrades to the sermon level which, again, do nothing to change the content of sermons.)  

For all that I'm sick of Stardew (600 hours) I know that another 37 hours with a new save would still give me some sense of purpose, progress, and connection to my little town. Graveyard Keeper fails to provide these qualities, and it's all the worse because I can see the sparks of potential there, I can see how great this game ALMOST was. I want to like it, I want to give the devs a thumbs up for effort, but in the end I just feel too cheated of my time to do so.

PROS
This game is pretty. I like the style, I like the music, I like the time setting. There is a LOT to do, so if you get the hang of it, you have the potential for a game that lasts you a really, really long time.

CONS
This game is HARD. It might be because I bought all the DLC, but holy crap you are not spoon fed at ALL. I find myself confused all the time about how to complete quests, where to go, how to obtain certain items I've never seen before... I mean, this game is seriously hard. And because I have all the DLC (This might be a problem for only base game as well!) I have TOO much to do. It stresses me out. I'm letting my crops sit for days, I have way too many organs and nowhere to store them so I spend half my day moving them to far away storage containers that also get filled up, I can't figure out how to get new equipment to properly prepare bodies, and therefore I can't get my graveyard score up, I don't know how to get new prayers, I ran out of iron again... The list goes on. It stressed me out. 
Additionally, I don't really like the characters. You can only talk to most of them for quests or else they have nothing to say to you. There were several times where I didn't do quests in order, and people started conversing about things that I hadn't learned yet.

Moral of the story: I mean, give it a shot if you want. I might come back to the game one day. But beware: IT IS HARD and if you get stressed out or anxious easily, this game will do you more harm than good. It needs a play mode where your hand is held a LOT more because it just dumps you off with barely any guidance  or tutorial and says ""Good luck..."" I would also wait till it's on sale- I got all the DLC in a $20 pack with the main game.",1683218672,1683218672,False,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

A lot of the late game slog was ignored with a little hindsight (or wiki hunting for first timers) and some cool tavern/anatomy features not included in the base game. less inventory problems from too much food, and since i wasn't looking to 100% everything i could avoid the bad mingames like fishing. if the collection is on sale for ~30CAN, it's a decent pick, but only play what you want to, and stop when you feel yourself drift off. if you're feeling like its' not worth hanging on for the end credits, it's not. 

Original post: Mixed feels. i want to recommend it, but i can't. High hookability rating, low return of payoff in terms of fun. there's variety there, but i can't say the minigames and such felt...complete? like i was waiting for the final gameplay element to sink in, and it never did. the core loop is strong enough i wanted to push through for 100%'s sake, but it felt empty at the end, and i was left wanting.

Tips if you plan to buy this: 
1. The first mistake i made was over focusing on food production, as i ended the midgame with enough food for several playthroughs over. Whoops.
2. 70$ for the complete game is too much. I didn't buy the DLC. I wager it would probably fix that feeling of something feeling missing, but I wasn't willing to sink another ~30$ for all the DLC into a game that cost me 8$ that felt incomplete without them. I think it'd be worth it if i bought it on sale, but too little, too late for me. don't make my mistake.
3. Games like this tend to have speedrun acheivements, or unlocks or secret endings. There isn't. I spent the first 10hrs of getting the hang of the controls trying to optimize my first week to have the church ready and minmax the tutorial but only realized too late there isn't such a thing. it sucks, the humour is so tongue in cheek i expected new dialog for blitzing the game and there wasn't, not to mention this is the Developer that has done this with their previous game, punch club. i think this is a lot more polished than punch club though.",1666766357,1683162047,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There's too much walking from one side of the map to the other in a day just to watch NPC that won't show up for another hour of game play walk out of there designated talking spot. If you don't know what you're doing, there's hardly any explanation for most of the core mechanics of the game so you'd be better off using a guide. Combat feels unresponsive; you kind of just take damage with no feedback so it's easy to die if you don't pay attention to your health on top of the 13 enemies clamoring down on you at once. The main premise of handling corpses can be largely ignored in favor of just improving the first 30 spaces in the graveyard to get enough clout to progress the story. Everything takes way to long and requires player interaction to complete making it much more tedious than pressing a button to start and stop an action.

Later EDIT (After I finished the game):
The game was fun for me. However, it's quite a bit grindy at times which wasn't really that fun. Most of the items you build just require you to keep a button pressed... So when trying to make 100 boards, or prepare 100 dough to make bread, your finger will start to hurt. Personally I just used a MACRO to do the work for me which made it more bareable.

Also, some of the stuff you get in game that would make your life easier, you get to late into the game at which point they don't even matter anymore.

From what i've heard, the DLC's make life a bit better.

Was considering buying the DLC's but noticed they are more expensive than the base game (i got mine on a sale, it was under 4$) so that's a no go for me considering I would have to start the game all over to take full use of them...

And, the most annoying part was the fact that after you take a quest from an NPC, when you view it in your tab the description is quite minimal. You need to read a bit of wiki to remember what exactly you have to do and to get for that NPC.

There's an unspeakable amount of crafting and resource stations, recipes, conversions and combinations, where you will definitely want to use a wiki to figure out what's what. But all the tedious legwork between the different areas with different crafting stations and different storage options ends up eating so much time while adding nothing to the game.

You want to craft the next tier of a crafting station and need to run around the base to collect the different parts and materials and return to the specific area to build the station in.

At the same time most of the unnecessarily intricate crafting can be completely skipped by just pumping up the church and fast forwarding to the sermon day, to collect donations that can go up pretty quickly, and then use other blessing items to unlock vendor levels and just get everything you need this way. Which is more streamlined but just as much a waiting game.

This game seems like a mix of Minecraft, Stardew Valley and an idle mobile game, that doesn't quite manage to be more than the sum of its parts.

The main issue is that it is very tedious. Tons of crafting but in the sense where you have to just keep holding down a button to make one item (and most things cannot be bulk crafted) so you repeat it over and over. Grinding for skill tree points is also a common challenge that makes the grind worse. You'd have to resort to farming craft items (which do not give many points) to progress.

The other big issue is just... waiting. Waiting for my keeper to sleep. Waiting for the NPC day to show up so I can actually talk to them. Waiting for my crafting to be done. Waiting for my keeper to walk everywhere because there is no way to get faster movement. (unless you use mods, which I did) Unlike other games, I can't fill that time with other activities because I would find myself bottlenecked at a certain point. Skipping days is also not possible, so you just have to wait or use up your energy so you can sleep. AKA, more holding down a button to craft. 

The dialogue is a bit funky at times and you realize even though it takes forever to walk across the map (the teleport stone does not go to nearly enough useful locations you have to frequent, like the swamp or Witch Hill), you actually don't have much to explore. It feels needlessly big. It feels like I'm always bottlenecked by one resource, which is fine and more than common in similar games, but Graveyard Keeper does not seem to flow as easily. For example, I unlock writing so I can craft a better prayer. But first I need to get paper to write a book. Then I need to unlock jewelry which is at the end of a completely different skill tree because it is required to make the book... somehow? Then I need to get gold-star stories to turn into notes for the book, but I can't get gold star stories because I'm not far enough in people's quest lines to get them, and in order to progress their questlines, I need to unlock the end of yet another skilltree for just one particular item. Once I finally get all the materials for the book, I'm already in late game and don't need the prayer as much anymore. This is in stark contrast to when I have to try to sleep/work through multiple weeks for the prayer day to come back so I can generate faith to, you guessed it, craft the one necessary item to progress the storyline.

The game is visually beautiful. There is one main song for the world which can get repetitive. I had a fun time, but I think it is dragged down by repetitive actions (and more importantly, unfun repetitive gameplay. There's a difference between grinding battles for xp vs holding down a key for 5 minutes while your keeper bulk crafts items.)",1682912697,1682912697,False,1,0,0.481946617364883423,0,True,False,False

The game has a lot going for it and I understand why so many people love and recommend it. It feels like a rabbit hole that keeps getting deeper as you progress. You get to gather resources, explore your surroundings, increase the quantity and quality of tools and village upgrades you can play with and you get to interact with several NPCs which give you tasks to complete. 

The music is serviceable and fits the tone. The art is wonderfully executed. 

As to why I can't recommend it, it's all about the pacing. The rabbit hole keeps getting deeper while recurrent tasks pile up. I got the feeling, very quickly, that I couldn't achieve what I wanted to in a day's time. I kept feeling that I was missing out on tasks. Instead of giving me a meaningful choice that felt empowering, it felt rather that I was making the wrong choice most of the time for how I would spend my day. I surprised myself after about 12 hours of playtime feeling stressed in a game that I was expecting to give me a feeling of wistful escapism like Animal Crossing, Dinkum or Stardew Valley. 

Arguably, Stardew Valley also gave me a bit of that feeling of not having enough time to achieve what I wanted, but it was so much more focussed, and gave me enough significant options that I felt I was making choices and enjoying my time after making these choices. Graveyard Keeper gave me too many options, didn't make it all that clear as to why I should prioritize one option rather than the other, leaving me dissatisfied with what I achieved most days. 

Not to mention the wasted time walking between spots and forgetting items, only to come back to your base's chests to get them and have nightfall hit you while a new body gets dropped requiring you to stop what you were doing to process it.

In this game, you play as a graveyard keeper tasked with maintaining a cemetery and ensuring that the dearly departed receive a proper burial. But, as you soon discover, there's much more to the job than just digging holes and placing bodies.

You'll need to gather resources, craft items, and even dabble in alchemy to create the perfect burial arrangements. And, if you're feeling a little macabre, you can even sell body parts to the local butcher for a bit of extra cash.

The game's quirky sense of humor is a real standout. From the sarcastic comments of your undead assistant to the absurd requests of the townsfolk, there's always a good chuckle to be had. Plus, the game's various quests and events add a sense of unpredictability that keeps things fresh and interesting.

The game's graphics and music are also a delight. The pixel art style is charming and detailed, with each character and location brimming with personality. The soundtrack is equally impressive, with haunting melodies and upbeat tunes that perfectly complement the game's tone.

The game's difficulty is just right, with a fair learning curve that rewards experimentation and exploration. And, if you do happen to mess up a burial or two, don't worry, the game's forgiveness system means that you'll never be stuck in a rut.

In conclusion, Graveyard Keeper is a hilarious and addictive game that will keep you entertained for hours on end. Whether you're a fan of simulation games, dark humor, or just want to try something new, this game is definitely worth digging up. So, put on your best gravedigger outfit and get ready to bury the competition.",1635802961,1682727731,True,0,0,0.478319436311721802,0,True,False,False

Apart from requiring a wiki to play, which I'm somewhat used to, it's just overwhelmingly tedious to play even if you aren't limited by time in-game—it instead makes you question if you want to deal with it IRL. From time specific NPCS and tasks, limited inventory space yet also separate work zones, grindy skill point management that could disrupt pacing of unlocks, and just the large empty map, it's just tasks that lead to more tasks that feels ironically lifeless and implemented just because other games have implemented them.

People say this game is like a goth Stardew, but it's more of a mix of Spiritfarer, My Time At Portia, and Punch Club, just minus the social aspects and being able to see the results. All you do is just pin point a quest/issue that needs to be done and then just trying to find out how to deal with it without wasting too much energy/time/money. It's just that instead it's 1 task with 47 steps that leads to another 7 tasks with their respective steps; however, if you already did these 2 tasks over here, you might shaved off 28 steps elsehwere.

As you manage your graveyard, you'll be tasked with burying bodies, gathering resources, and completing various tasks for the villagers in order to progress through the game.

At first glance, ""Graveyard Keeper"" might seem like a simple game, but as you delve deeper into its mechanics, you'll find a surprisingly deep and complex experience. The game has a steep learning curve, but once you get the hang of it, you'll find yourself completely immersed in the world of the game.

The graphics and sound design of ""Graveyard Keeper"" are impressive, with a dark and eerie aesthetic that perfectly suits the game's theme. The music is hauntingly beautiful, and the sound effects are crisp and satisfying.

One of the standout features of ""Graveyard Keeper"" is the sense of freedom it provides. You're free to explore the game world at your own pace and tackle tasks in any order you choose. This gives the game a sense of replayability, as you can experiment with different approaches to completing tasks and see how they play out.

That being said, ""Graveyard Keeper"" does have its flaws. The game can be repetitive at times, and some of the tasks can feel like busywork. Additionally, the game's humor and tone may not be to everyone's taste.

Overall, ""Graveyard Keeper"" is a unique and engaging simulation game that's well worth checking out if you're a fan of the genre. While it has its flaws, the game's depth, atmosphere, and sense of freedom make it a must-play for anyone who enjoys managing and building up a virtual world.",1682081806,1682481137,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

One good point, take your time, its not a timed game, so you can spend a lot of time getting crops up to gold star and generate limitless money if you have the patience.  

Cons are this:  Not enough content, considering how long this game been going thus far.  
Sticking point one: No way to sell even half of what is generated as items in the game.  So your ability to make money is limited, and until you can regularly generate at least silver star level stuff to sell to Horadric or a ton of the Gold Star Cakes once you get the recipe to the Merchant, its going to be slow going. a good idea is also, as soon as you have a desk, grind out the stories into notes, spend a day or two and ignore certain things, other than 2 days in particular, maybe 3.   Day of Greed, Holy Day and Day of Sloth. cause you can make some money from the various npc's that come around, and well Sermon day can net some money as you upgrade your church. 

Another issue, is the limited space, even once you get to end game and can automate most things, you are still very limited, and i feel there should be more there. Ability to upgrade the house is also something needed, as you are limited to two chests and that's it for storage in the house.

Edited 11/15/2019
Weak story line, half of the content will break the game, Developers do not respond to bug reports.  If you seem interested, wait for a while until they either fix a lot of the bugs, or it becomes dirt cheap, like 2 dollars cheap.

Update: 8/31/2020
They updated once in Dec 2019.  But very little else. Game still crashes during Stranger Things DLC when you reach a certain point, or if you try to do something out of order.  Developers are still not responding to anyone.  At this point, the game feels completely abandoned, as the projects they are working on now are worse than this.  I highly do not recommend buying this game, as what they provided for the price tag is not worth it.

4\2022 
Since the last update with the Better Souls DLC, game has become unstable. Crashes and corrupts save data.  the Latest DLC is also pretty bad. Provides little in the way of story line, and just allows you to quickly bypass the process of carefully finding the best corpses for putting in the ground or making into workers.  Certainly not worth 10 dollars. I would maybe give 2.5 dollars for so little content.  

4/2023
Game still needs some more content, as well as improvements.  There are a lot of things that should have been automated that are not. Case in point, once you reach a stable point to make worker zombies, being able to automate the Bee Hives would have been the first thing I would do if I found myself in that world. Also automating the Corpse pickup in the Morgue, because its not that complicated to do, especially if you can get zombies to make complex iron parts, picking up a corpse off the floor and putting it in a pallet would be childs play.

there is also a number of other areas that are sorely lacking.  One would be the main yard.  Late game upgrading would be where it starts to shine. 
1. Being able to further increase the size of the yard, this time to the north, and being able to break the block on the river, and channeling the water from that into a water wheel for further improvements, like a Furnace tier 4, that only gets a further speed boost and processing boost if the Water Wheel and yard improvements have been made. (think automated bellows) As well as being able to pave the yard with stone, stopping the generation of food prints and mud tracks (cause after a while, you have to save and quit, then reload or wait 7 in game days for them to fade) Additional boost to movement speed once paved. But make it cost a ton of stone, and have it in 3 upgrade points, first being the original yard, 2nd being the 1st expansion, 3rd being the last expansion. 
2.  Tier 3 Fertilizer and subsequent upgrades to all zombie farming, where tier 3 does not unlock a new tier of crops, so much as it increases the yield of seed and crop, as well as speed by 25%. 
3. Further late game improvements, like that ability to expand the Alchemy Lab, Morgue, and house size. 
Making it possible to increase the work area by 60% would change the way a lot of us do things.  There is also a need to make it possible to ROTATE all things that are applicable. Being able to place machines and such where and how we want allows for better optimization. 
4. This is a big one.  Need to get a repeatable mine option, that can be left for very late game, after completely clearing the 15 levels of the dungeon, so that you can go into the mine and it will randomly generate what you can find there, have 3 levels to the mine,
 1st level have Iron deposits, maybe stone and marble rocks, and a small chance for silver deposits. 
Mobs can be as they were in the Dungeon for 1 to 4
2nd Level less Iron and stone, but now has a much higher chance of silver, with a small chance of gold, and very small chance at diamonds.  Mobs being same as dungeon from 4 to 9
3rd Level has no iron, but has Marble, Silver, gold and decent chance at diamonds, as well as containers that can be broken to drop various random items, as well as other loots stuff. Pots, bowls, seeds, ingots, tools in varying degrees of damaged, swords but only to steel, not Damask tier. Mobs would be what you would have from 10 to 15 in the Dungeon.

I have had this game on my wishlist since it first came out on Steam. I have been holding off because some of the reviews have always made me think twice. So a few days ago, i was browsing looking for new games... and i seen this was on sale for under $5 -then i seen that there was a  Graveyard Keeper Last Journey Edition which was a little over $10! It includes: base game, game music, game Artbook,  DLC: Stranger Sins, DLC: Game of Crone, and DLC: Better Save Soul! So i decided to go to YT,  go to Splattercat's channel then search for Graveyard Keeper. After watching one of his videos I immediately bought it, and I am very, very glad I did!!! I have played a little over 3 hours and i am IN LOVE with game... i will tho agree with some of the comments on here... You will need to have a guide or the games' Wiki out along side the game... So if you are on the fence like i was, go watch Splattercat (make sure to like and subscribe ;p) see how the game looks, plays, etc... I mean this is an amazing deal right now! 

I totally recommend this game! 

PS i do like how they named their DLCs after certain shows, books, etc... and using the same fonts and stuff too, that clever!

There is no rush to do anything, you just basically dunno grow cabbage instead of following the quest. I really enjoyed it for couple of days until it started to get more and more frustrating and it feels extremely lazy.

- Most of things are not intuitive and there is no way to know how to do it unless you constantly google.
- Multiple trunks in crafting areas with tiny capacity (and your own inventory is tiny too), so you have to run around like an ass transferring stuff from one box to another, and there is no end to it. 
- Carrying logs, stone slabs and etc. 1 at a time. Across a big chunk of map. And you need A LOT of materials to do anything. Like, you just managed to create a plank, boom, flinch run out, logs run out. Yeah, I know about zombies. Almost got patience to start unlocking them, just got one. But my patience ended at another stone slab carrying session.
- Because crafting stuff is basically main game thing, all this little inconveniences that were okay at the very start, pile up in huge amount of stupid repetitive tasks. 
- You can't drop things, only destroy them. So, if you find cool stuff and your tiny inventory runs out, be prepared to run for half of the play day just to put something home and get back. Nope, teleporter stone does not save you much, because there are so many locations with no teleport point.
- Quests are borderline primitive, you can't talk to most of NPCs, they just feel as not connected to the world or each other. ""Buy stuff from this guy. Give this guy apples, now you can bake pies. You won't talk to them again. Hooray"". 

So basically the main concept of the game is to run around for hours to complete simplest tasks like creating some parts, wood, research some scheme to create more stuff. I feel like the developers took it extremely easy - yay, there is zero gameplay convenience, we don't have to think through stuff, let's call it a unique indie game. It started as calm and cute and ended up feeling extremely tedious and frustrating. I've been to many locations and actually done a number of quests but don't see any interesting story here. 

And as a bonus, I get so many reference to the Town location, NPCs telling me I need to go there to get a number of stuff done. get permission, etc. and I accidentally learned it literally doesn't exist. Like, what????

A lot of tedious work which results in more work. There isn't a point to progressing in this game since the only reward is amplifying the amount you have to do with nothing in return. The keeping the graveyard was the most appealing aspect to me, but that quest line just left me with a feeling of emptiness as did the rest of the many tasks given by the game. This game also has a visual bug of walk cycle being very jittery which i don't know how made it in the release version.
It's just not worth the time in playing since this game ultimately feels like there is no point towards all the tasks you are given. Keeping the graveyard and maintaining it can be fun however the only reward from this is both the self satisfaction of maintaining the graveyard and advancing a specific quest line. Just feels like constant blue balls of actual satisfying progression with no one giving a shit about your graveyard. The npcs in this game are very flat with only some 'witty' banter with the main character. NPCs usually are trade posts with dispensing objectives that as i mentioned before comes with usually zero reward. The grind can be chill however the grind is simply for the sake of grinding with the only real reward being the tools to stop playing the game.

1. Sprint Reloaded (weeeeee!)
2. Wheres Ma Storage (universal storage)
3. Beam Me Up Gerry (easier teleport)

I'll explain why. The basic walking speed is [i]agonizingly[/i] slow! Yes, you do get a teleport stone but its destination options are limited. And yes, you do eventually get speed potions but these are gated behind alchemy and require using up some vital ingredients. Large parts of the map are either completely empty (beach area) or intentionally circuitous (swamp) and a slow walking speed just magnifies the boredom.

Now, this is bad enough on its own, but the devs — [i]on multiple occasions[/i] — went out of their way to make this as punishing, as agonizing, and as frustrating as possible. For example, you can build a bridge shortcut in the swamp, so the maze [i]theoretically[/i] only needs to be traversed once. However this is only possible if you knew in advance to bring building materials with you. What's that? You brought 6 flitch, 3 planks, but only 9 nails? Well I guess you have to teleport yourself back home to get that extra nail, then walk aaaaall the way back here again next time. If you can remember.

Some parts seem like intentional trolling. A lot of characters you need to interact with for quests appear literally only once a week, and so many of the quests have you ping-ponging from person to person, across space and time, to fulfill very basic quest objectives. Oh so X asked you to do something? Well first go talk to Y on B day. B day arrives and you remember to talk to Y, who tells you that you need to bring Z number of items. Ideally you have the items on you, but realistically you'll need to walk/teleport back to craft them, or wait for C day when W person is available so that you can buy them. Even if you manage to craft them, you have to hurry up back to Y before the sun goes down. If it's too late, you have to wait an entire week to try again! And that's just one step in the quest!!

This is bad. It's awful. It's purely a waste of the player's time and appears to be a cynical ploy to artificially inflate the number of hours of ""gameplay"" the devs can advertise. It's a damn shame too, because the underlying gameplay is solid! When I first tried playing the game, I melted of boredom and uninstalled it. It was purely on a whim that I decided to see if anyone modded the annoyances that I tried it again and got hooked.

Once you mod away all the inane design decisions, this is a beautifully drawn game, with a fascinating and unique history, and a really satisfying and compelling gameplay loop. If only the devs knew.",1682126362,1682126362,False,73,3,0.711821496486663818,0,True,False,False

The tutorials don't really explain anything adequately, and I feel that some things are far more complex than they need to be simply for the sake of being complex. Complexity doesn't always equal depth, something these developers clearly don't seem to understand. 

I don't mind needing to use a game's wiki once in a while to gain insight on a certain system or mechanic, but when a game requires you to do so multiple times within the first few hours of playing because it doesn't explain how things work adequately (if at all), that's not good design. I can and do enjoy games which don't 'hold your hand', but explaining basic game function isn't hand holding. 

Honestly, just go play Stardew Valley or Harvest Moon or something instead. They're far better designed. Yes, you might need to look some things up on their respective wikis, but not until you're well into the end game.

Edit: Uninstalled. I tried to give it another go, but the grind is just so boring and tedious. There's just no fun here, no real feeling of progress. The game forces you to grind things for quests. For example, the donkey that brings you corpses suddenly demands to be paid in carrots. This forces you to start gardening, which forces you to do a quest to use the garden, which forces you to grow several different kinds of vegetables, which takes seeds, which cost money, which forces you to grind things to sell, which takes energy AND forces you to stop fixing things JUST SO YOU CAN DO THE BASIC JOB OF BURYING FLIPPING CORPSES WHICH IS THE WHOLE REASON YOU EXIST IN THE GAME WORLD IN THE FIRST FREAKING PLACE!!! Basic activities you should be able to do require entire quest chains to access. It's ridiculous. Even getting paid for your primary function is locked behind a quest which can't even be completed until (I'm guessing) mid-game.  

If all that crap were optional, it'd be fine. If you could tackle it at your own pace, it'd be fine. But it's not.

- extract their organs so you can study them in a dungeon
- tear off some skin to use as leather for some armour
- mess with a corpse for the fun of it

before dumping it in a river that leads to the town where people probably drink the water and wonder why it tastes weird lately. If you are not into that, you could just put high quality corpses in graves so the church cemetery has a higher rating and you get bonuses for your hard work. 

Do you hate being able to know how to craft things in the beginning of a game? Well this game does not properly explain things and you will wonder how the fuck you are supposed to make a wooden anvil (its some catch 22 bullshit) before eventually gaining the materials from quests or in some barrels.

Hours of fun are to be had trying to figure out how to gain blue tech points. You will search for ways to get them online, but all the websites won't help you, because they only tell you ways you can get those points after constructing a research table or other methods which require those blue points to do in the first place. Truly an amazing experience. Then you find an astronomer dude and waste all your precious money on books so you can actually have blue points. 

Some guy will tell you he wants you to grow vegetables, but you will not be able to find where the fuck this farmer is that sells these seeds even though there are like 3 farms in the town, none of which seem to have an NPC that will actually sell you seeds.

Maybe the game is a little bit frustrating but desecrating corpses and decorating graves for the end goal of getting back home and seeing your wife or girlfriend or whatever relationship that female had with the main character - maybe his stepsister, I dunno (I forgot) - is all worth it. This is a good game in the 'Main character finds himself in some strange town and has to do a whole lot of hard work just to get back home, also they are probably dead or in a coma' genre. The main character telling everyone that everyone is calling him the graveyard keeper and he doesn't know why reminds me of the main character in Harvester - everyone in town would say ""You always were a kidder Steve"". 

Also I love the art style and if you don't then... I hope you step on some Lego and die from a yeast infection. Are you blind? Have you seen how about 99.99% of pixel graphics games on Steam look?

From the hand-drawn graphics to the complex crafting system, everything in Graveyard Keeper feels meticulously crafted and thought out. The game also offers a great sense of progression, as you unlock new technologies, improve your graveyard, and explore new areas.

However, the one negative point about the game is its occasionally slow pacing. While the game is immersive and offers a lot to do, there are times when it feels like progress is slow or when you're stuck waiting for certain resources to become available. This can be frustrating at times, especially if you're eager to progress further into the game.

Despite this minor issue, Graveyard Keeper is an excellent game that is definitely worth checking out. The world-building, crafting mechanics, and sense of exploration are all top-notch, and the game offers a lot of value for its price. If you're a fan of simulation or RPG games, Graveyard Keeper is definitely a title you should consider adding to your library.",1682010518,1682010518,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Graveyard Keeper offers you a nearly endless checklist of stuff to do, which will keep you busy practically 99% of the time. At the same time, though, it's also very laid back, as the pace of the progression is completely up to the player, and the various quests can be completed without worrying of missing a deadline.
It's a great game in which you can easily sink dozens of hours without noticing.

Having played with and without DLCs, though, I'd suggest getting at least Stranger Sins for your first playthrough: the added mechanics and stuff to manage might seem overwhelming at first, but the DLC adds a lot of depth to the story and the characters, which are both kind of bare-bones in the base game and not nearly as compelling.

The biggest flaw the game has, in my opinion, is how clumsily it teaches you new  mechanics; the tutorials are fine for explaining the basics in the early game, but when it comes to more advanced stuff, they leave out a lot of very important information. Pair this with the fact that some mechanics are very, very counterintuitive, and figuring stuff out on your own can become a frustrating experience.
So, I'd suggest you to feel free to check out outside sources, like the wiki, when you feel you haven't fully grasped something. It'll save you a lot of headaches.",1681942468,1681942468,True,1,1,0.513888895511627197,0,True,False,False

1. there's no way to check the building requirements without going to the specific blueprint station that the building is tied to so if you want to build something and you don't have either the recipe memorized from previous play troughs or have the games wiki page open you basically have to make two trips from where you keep your mats or just carry everything on you at all times
2. the tasks your given throughout the game do not have a set page instead its under the npc page where it just gives brief descriptions of what the task is instead of actually explaining what you need to do because certain npcs only show up on certain days but it doesn't explain it just briefly mentioned in the initial dialog for getting the tasks and there's no way to track them either
3. it doesn't do very well at teaching new players how to do certain things like I do not recall seeing anything even after looking through each tutorial that explained how to use the sword I had to look in the control to learn that but I mightve missed where they explained that one but even for a few other things its kinda just ""here's this go figure it out"" for many different things
4. even after playing for a while it still hasn't fully explained the whole process of extracting the parts from bodies maybe that'll be explained later but for now it doesn't seem to make any sense as to what affects the corpses rating
5. when unlocking things it doesn't tell you what blueprint table it gets sent to so you have to go to each table you have and try to figure out where the thing you just unlocked went to and some of them like the cremation one doesn't even go to one you had it just unlocks a whole new table but doesn't tell you at all
6. this is just a personal one but the map doesn't show any kind of icon as to where you are so you have to figure out based on what your around and then figure out where to go form there",1681897689,1681897689,True,2,1,0.540069699287414551,0,True,False,False

Would I recommend this game? Yes. If you're familiar with Star Dew Valley, and its farming mechanics then you're already aware of what you will be signing up for.
The game doens't hold your hand and there is no shame in looking up things on the Wikipedia, or YouTube. It helped me immensely and it also helped me steer my development in a more efficient way.

I would strongly encourage everyone to buy the game with all its DLCs. It helps greatly expand on the story, elaborate on information, and give some AWESOME additions to the game, such as zombie farms, a tavern, and a side missions where you hunt for vampires and rescue refugees.

The ending felt satisfying, after so many hours invested to the game, seeing the ending for the hero was such a blast. The DLC also helped better explain some odd comments that you are given through the game, and it all starts to come together.

There were moments when I had to grind a lot to make progress and at the end the money you acquire has little to no real impact or meaning though for games such as these, that's standard.

In the end. I had fun with this. I enjoyed it, and while I don't see myself replaying the game anytime soon, it was a solid game that helped me put some hundred hours behind me.",1681509488,1681509488,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

This game does not have a proper tutorial, and to figure out how you're supposed to do things you either need to spend an inordinate amount of time working it out for yourself or using the Wiki (which I did). That does not make the game any easier-tasks quickly become tedious and repetitive, the difficulty increases over time, and one of the key missions of the game turns out to be a fluke.

Problems:
Though good game and i had quite a lot of fun with it.
Mainly stating there are a lot of bugs that you don't have to be a game tester to just bump into and replicate very easily, this is not a finished game and shouldn't be sold as such.
I have also quite a few problems with the gameplay itself. character is slow and once you get to speed potions (which are fairly expansive, you cannot get enough of them and they don't last quite long enough). 
getting money is extremely grindy.
**spoiler** like if you're playing the base game. good luck trying to get the aristocrat papers. 12 gold coins is huge amount of money and it will take you hours to get there. something that stranger sins DLC will help you with dramatically.
other parts of the game are not so grindy. mainly the only problem is mining of rare resources. silver can be found fairly often however gold cannot and you need to do fishing. also stone will loose it's value very quickly once you get to marble.",1680939670,1680939670,False,0,0,0.415690183639526367,0,True,False,False

You can't talk to the vast majority of NPCs, or interact much with the land and buildings outside your estate. Raising corpses, which sounds exciting, is ineffective at best until the late game. Arbitrarily high research costs for technology leave you churning out glass flasks. The story is tongue-in-cheek, but often borders on plain laziness.

Things to do: Take care of your graveyard and upgrade it, gather materials through the map, advance in the tech tree that gives you access to new actions like: Learning how to grow bee's, new recipe's, smithing, woodwork, spirituality and anatomy.

Missions: What might feel a bit tedious is accepting a quest and having to wait a whole week to meet the NPC again to complete it. If you take your time exploring the map, you'll have plenty of missions to complete.

Da Feel of the game: It's got a anti-capitalist donkey, a semi-aware talking skull, it's got wit and just enough comedy for this type of game. Can feel a bit slow at times. Stacking up on food is the answer to most problems in the game.

The positives first: the pixel art is unrivalled genius and second to none. The animations are great and very smooth and a sight to see. The village, its buildings, as well as the nature look great and are bursting with details that make it easy to get completely lost in this world. 
And that immediately brings me to a very big negative point for me: the game is extremely confusing, mechanics are not explained and are hidden behind extremely vague quest texts or extremely obstructive mechanics. For this reason, you have to constantly tab out of the game and read up - for example, on the sheer amount of alchemical ingredients that you later simply have to guess with combinations of two or three. But permanently tabbing out of the game destroys any immersion for me.

The OST is a dream and is unmistakably good, but unfortunately becomes massively repetitive after several hours - SDV solved this a little better with the seasons. The story surrounding the mysterious village is incredibly interesting and invites you to explore, but is extremely watered down by extreme time-gating (sometimes up to several ingame weeks), you tend to forget what the earlier dialogues were about. 

The battle system is very clunky and would not have been necessary for me. In general, the developers seem to have tried to pack as much as they can into the game. A tavern, a fishing game, a massive grind that can be made easier by grinding zombies, housing, a refugee camp, a garden with a vineyard, and so on. Suddenly there is a strange workshop where you can heal sins, and of course there is the eponymous church and graveyard. Everything is available in minute 1, and can completely slay first-time players like me and force them back to reading outside the game. 

Two things are a huge problem for me: Right at the beginning, the town pass is made palatable - but this is a really bad joke by the developers. With a sum of money that is insanely high at the beginning of the game, you can buy a pass that supposedly allows you to see the big city. Instead, however, the character is killed by lightning. I don't mind a joke, but this is just really unfair when you consider that because of the great pixel art, players naturally want to see the city, do nothing wrong and spend the almost prohibitively expensive 12 silver at the beginning. This joke is just arrogant and unfair.

The second is the recurring bugs. For example, an important message from a bard does not appear and has to be cheated into existence via the console. Moreover, because nothing is ever explained, you often think you are dealing with a bug, only to realise by chance that your progress is linked to a completely different task or how far you have progressed. A typical example is a carrot that has to be enchanted, but is not listed in the long list of options at the witch.
After solving complete different quests said carrot is suddenly shown and can be enchanted, that's so confusing and frustrating.
The devs love to make fun of their players and this is something I consider as a bad move. 
Could have been a great game and in the end it is more an unfair grindfest with bad mechanics with a beautiful artstyle.

Pros:
- Great story, characters, & humor
- Interesting premise
- Great pixel art
- I like that objectives are day-based but can be completed at your own pace
- A diverse range of systems keeps things interesting
- The religious overtones make the game interesting
- The brewery was a cool idea
- The tech trees are a good idea  (could use some improvements though)
- Geralt of Rivia
- There is a vendor that only sells DIRT

Cons:
- All of the crafting systems are in different areas with separate inventory (run back and forth)
- Crafting stations aren't always direct upgrades, knowing which stations to use gets confusing sometimes
- Areas you can build are very limited (awkward layouts)
- Stations cannot be moved without being broken
- Fast travel needs to be better
- Alchemy is pretty badly designed (i.e. multiple stations for breaking down ingredients, multiple stations for mixing ingredients, multiple other stations for books, paper, studying, and misc crafting items)
- Unlocking alchemy combinations is guess work. Nobody has time for that devs... the best route is to either just buy alchemy scrolls or look up recipes on the game Wiki.
- 99% of quests are just fetch quests & cutscenes
- Combat sucks & the dungeon is mostly pointless filler (the end reward of the dungeon end can be purchased in a shop at any point & also isn't used for anything either? huh?)
- Automation with zombies is not fully automated which defeats the purpose. I like the idea, but at some point I want to stop micro-managing my brewery water level and do other things
- Most crafted items don't need to be crafted. Most are can be purchased or received as a reward. This negates the need for end-game crafting systems. Example: I played the entire game 100% without crafting marble items which are end game tier. Also, I crafted the highest tier sword and in the next mission received it as a reward.
- The graveyard is not very important in the grand scheme of the game (besides completing a few objectives for one person). You can also boost your graveyard score to insane levels by just planting grass paths and not burying corpses
- Fishing is 100% pointless the entire game
- Sleep/wait is VERY frustrating at endgame for the last few missions (wait multiple weeks??? come on devs)
- You cannot pin craft ingredients
- In the DLC, I feel like the saving souls mechanics are mostly useless besides completing the questline. I also don't see much point in the ""remote build"" option, I didn't use it once. Seems like wasted potential
- What can sell to vendors is very arbitrary (example, innkeeper will buy bad beer but will not buy good beer???? blacksmith will buy cheap tools/weapons but not others of better quality)
- Building up to a mega graveyard is basically pointless and a missed opportunity

Honest opinion, it's not a bad game but suffers from tedious fetch quests, lots of grind, and an insane number of crafting systems (with DLC). I have also played Stardew Valley and similar titles and just feel like GK is more tedious and less rewarding. I wouldn't mind if there were a lot of crafting systems if they weren't so cumbersome & separated.  I did play the whole game but see very little reason to continue playing after beating it.

I've played this on the Switch as well, which takes me up to 60h. This game is massively fun, you get to manage a graveyard (duh), you do farming, mining, alchemy, cooking, and raising a zombie army to do all of those aforementioned tasks. The setting is macabre, but there is humour to offset it. Even without dlc, there is so much to do, you are going to be jumping task onto another, and suddenly 6h have gone by. 

That being said: the game is very flawed. There is basically little to no hand holding, you are left by yourself to figure out what to do. You will need a wiki. You might need videos. Watch ""I played 100 days of Graveyard Keeper"" by Floydson whilst playing, it helps a ton.
I have nearly every mod on Nexus installed to combat certain flaws, so I highly recommend installing some.

- game is extremely unfunny. this is subjective i know, but the game tries really hard to be funny and falls flat every single time for me. everyone is cringe.

some things they need to change before this game is even close to being good and recommending it. 

1) Pin what missions are active(because the only way to know is to go up to the NPC that gave you that mission) and that's just lazy dev work.

2) have a way to pin recipes you are trying to fulfill. again lazy dev work. it's like they are trying to make the game realistic but they don't have paper, pencils, or books to write on in the game??? lol laziness.

3) have better tutorials for everything you do. There's no direction or information on what or how to do things in the game. you have to look it up and even then it's hard to find exactly what you are trying to look for. it ruins the whole concept of what kind of game this is supposed to be, crafting/survival. this must be the first game where I'm so confused and have to look every single thing up that it destroys what fun I was having.
 
these three simple things are what made me decide this is a bad game. They are easy fixes but again it might just be laziness on the devs to try and fix them. maybe they just don't have the ability to fix it?

For me, it's highly addictive. Lots of styles of play possible without negative consequences.

I also really enjoy the theme and the dialogue with the NPCs is really funny. 

My biggest complaint though is that there's barely a tutorial. You're just kind of thrown into it with little guidance on how anything works. I saw someone say online that it might be intentional because it fits well with the narrative of the game, but I don't think it's worth the cost of literally not understanding any of the game mechanics. Like, you'll be told you've 'unlocked' certain blueprints but it doesn't tell you that you still have to manually 'unlock' them in your tech tree using their points system.

One other thing that bothers me is related to the NPC quests. While you can see the exact requirements in a banner while you're talking to them, it doesn't always show those details in the dedicated quest menu.

You cannot place a cutter TWO, nor can you place any wood cutting stations which will allow you to make an item you NEED TO MINE STONE AND MARBLE. You deal with all these frustrating designs all the while the game mocks you with its characters.

pros
beats my £1 per hour test (i got the £15 bundle offer)
you dont have to graveyard keep to progress you can halt the bodys coming in (stop a mission progressing and no more bodies)
can take your time and enjoy the game
lots of things to do farming, combat, construction and resourse gathering

cons
when you make something in alchemy it dosnt record it so you have a list unless its a potion you make
you lose seeds when you grow veg at the start
no note pad for you to jot down mats you want to lookfor/bring to a location

overall thoughts
its a very good game at a good price a few minor things that annoy me but nothing that holds the game back. i would suggest giving it a go if you want to play something that dosnt require you to go ""ill be there in 5 min!"" and you show up 2 hours later.

1. Quests need their own separate info page away from character bios. A task list perhaps, to keep people on track.

2. There needs to be a way to grow your energy bar throughout the game (or reduce energy costs)

3. We need a way to increase the size of our item bag

4. A mailbox would be nice to receive payments from the merchant and your tavern, and updates on quests

5. Dungeon maps

6. Some form of alchemy/resurrection guideline... a book of recipes? a character that teaches you the basics?

7. Make it so if you accidentally put an item in your tavern's display case, you can take it back out again

8. Make it so you can't accidentally delete a quest item

9. Make it so you can rotate all items upon placement

10. Reduce teleport cooldown time

11. Be able to craft more than one upgradable item at once (ex. gold star pumpkin soup)

You don't lose items if you die. If you stay awake too long, you just get a gentle DoT on your energy to reinforce you to go to sleep. (Sleep is how you save, so this is very smart.)

Yeah, it's like Stardew Valley alright - if you removed every part of what made Stardew Valley fun and relaxing and replaced it with boring insufferable grind and dumb fucking mechanics.

- The energy bar does not get any better ever. You have to make food in order for it to be anywhere decent if you want to continue the boring grind the game forces you to do - and making food also costs stamina, for some fucking reason, so a chunk of what you'd get from making it will be spent anyway in the process. Making items will always cost the same amount of stamina no matter what point of the game you're in, so you'll catch yourself carrying a shitton of food everywhere from beginning to end or sleeping ALL. THE. TIME.
- Most relevant NPCs are only available ONCE A WEEK. Stardew fans, know all the times you really needed Pierre only to remember it's Wednesday and he has fucked off into oblivion? Well, now imagine if Pierre ONLY showed up on Wednesdays and never again in the entire game! Fun, right? NOT. Also, I've lost count of how many times one of those weekly NPC's quests have asked me to talk to ANOTHER weekly NPC that is already gone, making me wait another whole week in order to progress (the ""Fast Forward"" mechanic available to you - Meditation - is very fucking slow and you might as well just spend all that time browsing social media or something)
- So many quests at the same time and absolutely no efficient way to view them all (the ""Characters"" screen that shows their missions is pretty poorly designed). I regret buying all the DLCs and installing them for my first playthrough because all it did was give me more quests to be confused by - and some of those you can't even complete until MUCH later on in the game, the biggest offender being literally the first quest you get (the one about the meat stamp).
- Building spaces, like the outside of the house and the wine cellar, are EXTREMELY BADLY designed. All the items have different sizes and there's no efficient way to accomodate them in the space the game gives you, so there's a LOT of unused SQM in those building spaces because nothing fits properly and your work area just ends up looking wonky.
- Everything takes SO. LONG. Between NPCs that only show up once a week, items that need dozens of other stuff made in order to be created, the actual walking you have to do almost everywhere (ESPECIALLY before you get a teleport stone, which is something the game doesn't actually tell you exists, making you stress yourself out unless you use the incomplete-in-some-parts wiki) and the amount of collecting you have to do (it's BEYOND ridiculous that sticks can only be gathered from cutting trees), it gets super boring super fast. Great insomnia medicine right there.
- The dungeon is awful. I don't know who had that idea of making it so that you need to kill all enemies in order to progress further down even after you find the stairs, but they need fired immediately. Luckily, it also serves little to no purpose to the actual story, so you can skip it a lot of the time - seriously, why is this thing in the game?

Yeah, it has some funny quips here and there in dialogue and the artwork is fantastic, but to say it compares to Stardew Valley is a HUGE offense to the latter.

The last *30* hours vastly overstay their welcome. The game actively fights the player's time, with lots of frustrating mechanics and interactions.

On sale, this game is worth $7 for the first 10 hours. If you decide to pick it up, when the grind starts to kick in, just stop playing. This game does not respect your time. It vastly overstays its welcome.

Positive:
* The pixel art, sounds, and animations are all incredible. The visual fidelity is beautiful and fantastic and well thought out.
* The initial run of the game is INCREDIBLY fun. They have the bones for some good gameplay here!
* Tech trees and ""teching up"" in the early game is fun and enjoyable. The pacing feels really good.
* There is a communist donkey which is actually hilarious!

Neutral:
* Managing the main base in the end-game is a chore
* Donkey did not have enough interaction with the player

Negative:
* The in-game clock, a ""Day"" is too short and a ""Week"" is too long. I'm always stressed during the day while also impatient for the week!
* Grinding faith is terrible in the early game. You require it to advance several bottlenecks at once. This is not a compelling choice situation.
* Destructing buildings do not return their full resources, and you can't move them. This means when you realize you messed up or misclicked a build... you're SOL and the resources are wasted
* Doing the final tech-ups requires grinding making resources, which take up too much space
* Automating anything still requires too much player work.
* The entire graveyard interaction is minimal.
* The core menu interactions require 2-3 more clicks than they should.
* The middle of the game has an intense grind, where you are struggling to automate and advance several tech trees at the same time. This isn't a fun automation... its only a grind.
* The crafting mechanics means bulk-producing things when you do automate them is impossible. You have to babysit something that takes 15-20 seconds to craft.
* The game's economy is rough. The early game, you don't have enough money to do anything. By the end, you have enough money to do everything... except for advancing the final plot line. It requires 12 Gold, which is a lot for the game. This requires a fully automated base or lots of time sunk doing menial farming work.
* Starting to end the game requires you to automate everything... so the last 2-3 hours are spent just sitting around waiting for time to advance
* The final quest lines requires going back and forth waiting for the in-game ""days"" clock to advance... because the game wasn't padded enough already?",1678858224,1678858224,False,5,0,0.518811881542205811,0,True,False,False

Pros:
-Great pixel art
-A ton of different systems to engage with, many of them are well fleshed out
-Fairly likable cast of characters
-Refreshing theme
-Great gamepad support
-Overall, a solid Life-Sim type game

Cons:
-Game is surprisingly buggy
-Pacing on certain resources is really bad. I recommend using some mods.
-Even though there are many systems, once you go ""all out"" on one system you can make enough money to buy any item you need for the rest of the game. It makes engaging with most of the systems irrelevant fairly quickly.
-Dialog presentation is not my favorite. Its just speech bubbles above the sprite, I much prefer traditional dialog boxes at the bottom of the screen. Easier to read long text and often I'd find the speech bubbles would clip or overlap in ways that made them impossible to read. Also for some reason you can't pause dialog, it will always auto play. If you have to step away in the middle of a long dialog scene you're going to miss chunks of story.

-

It's profoundly underwhelming, not delivering to the expectations it builds during gameplay, remaining a waste of time until the very end of it. There's no reward whatsoever, just the same over and over again. You need excesive amounts of grinding (while enduring an unresponsive gameplay full of bugs) just to remain the same, No final goals, no final boss, no rewarding narrative, nothing.

The dlcs are not mandatory, but they do add depth to the history and mix of OP powers/money making and also grind.
It can become confusing when/where you are dealing with main story vs dlc story.
You don't need the nicest heavily optimized graveyard to finish the game, but you do need to tend to it and get it to a fair level.

A lot like Stardew Valley but with a dark sense of humor and a light hearted approach to everything, I found myself really having fun within the first few interactions and first few objectives. Then, for some reason, I kept running into roadblocks and had a hard time completing objectives. And it was mostly due to my perfectionism and complete lack of focus. I would run around trying to empty my chests and optimise my gains by running to every single thing the game offers... And that is too much. You end up not being able to progress. See, I like making everything perfect before progressing in the campaign. I'm a side quest kinda guy. The kinda guy that keeps their 99 potions until the end boss and then realises he didn't need them. I hoard potatoes in Skyrim. And well, this game doesn't really care about that kinda person. Getting ''just'' what you need and moving onto the next objectives was the way to go and may have shrunk the time I spent on this game to about... Oh I dunno... 20-30 hours, I imagine, tops. 

On one side you have multiple enterprises to manage that are very intelligently woven together, tradesmen that have tiers to buy/sell from (though very limited), a day/night and week cycle with a weather system (weather system is just for prettiness), an environment that is very interactable with and quirky characters (I swear one of the NPC (Mrs Charm) says ''croissantperlecroissantperle'' over and over again...). 

But on the other side; Some of the enterprises are just a bore and you'll be forced to deal with them to progress the story. Tradesmen, though useful, don't necessarily want all your junk, and it feels like a bit of a trial and error at times. Many NPCs will only show up one day a week, having you run all over the place and sometimes just plain not make it in time (to hand in a quest) and you'll just have to do whatever for the days to pass. I would have enjoyed more story, but the game is mostly about micromanagement, which it does a good job at.

All in all, I liked it. But it's not for everyone. It's very repetitive, but it itched a spot for me. But itching the same spot for over 70 hours hurts. Which is why I don't think I'm going to try the DLCs. Also, if you get this game, buy the Teleport Stone at the Inn. Like... You just have to.

Everyone you interact with is either a moron, a sleazebag, or sarcastic jerk, though they're not(all) cartoonishly evil and keep some lovable traits. The game will see you commit some absolutely abhorrent acts of immorality, but brushes them off without judgement or re-examining. It's interesting and makes moral choices something really done in-character.

The humor is good. I actually audibly laughed out loud about the circumstances that lead me to getting my first set of food recipes, and when Donkey donated carrot seeds.

My only gripe is that the grind severally misses the mark in many places. Unless you play with a guide from the first minute or are a returning vet, you will be gated by more than resources and game-stage. This complaint is difficult to write in short but -- you receive things to do in shotgun blasts as opposed to a trickle of new complexity and activities. I'd find myself just trying to pass the day because i'd completed everything I could do that day, unrelated to energy, resources, or game-stage. 

That is the crux of my issue with Graveyard Keeper. I am not new to grind games and I enjoy them, but I want to grind, not wait. If I were the devs still looking to balance the game I would double every resource cost at every stage of complexity(besides cooking), and halve the amount of energy necessary to craft. That way the 'eureka' moment feels like a gain of function as opposed to a temporary relief from frustration.
But it's good, problems aside it's still in my top 5. For as slowly and as casually as I play it's silly that I need a guide, but I do.

If I hadn't been forced to put in extra hours thanks to softlocking and a very sneaky ""correct"" progression path, I would have refunded this game. I like to call it a ""carry big objects back to your house"" simulator, or perhaps carpenter simulator with far less graveyard care than there should be with a title like that.
Bought the game and all dlc on sale for less than the base game costs normally and still don't find it worth the price. It's too bad because there was some great potential here. But starting the dlc content is where the story maybe got a tiny bit interesting. For that to be the case it shouldn't be dlc at all. When the game spoils how it ends long before you get there, what's the point in even continuing? 
The overworld is massive, and it doesn't need to be so you spend too much time trying to wander from one corner of the land to the other in unused space, which makes having to lug those big trees and stones back even more annoying from long distances that gets used up in 2 seconds. The majority of my playtime was doing this, and also looking up one object after another online to find out how to progress because there is frustratingly little tutorials and explanations for everything.
For a game called Graveyard Keeper, you spend little time actually taking care of the graveyard and get little reward for it. The concept of eventually having to buy bodies to bury is silly, and you'd think there would be more attention to this side of the game. You'd expect to at least be able to decorate, or have more than a couple fences or headstones to use to make a grave. 

This is a great example of a game you wish was good. Missing the mark and leaving so much untapped potential. Feeling little reward for grindy work in any game is a tried and true way to lose players.",1678470291,1678471752,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You need Item A to craft Item B, but you need Item B to craft Item A. 
So what? You introduce a quest you complete later down the line and can't do anything with and does nothing but confuse the early game? 
There's so much of that. If you can't access it right now, why even suggest you could if you wanted to? Like you have 4 annoying little squares that are for inventory or something on your screen at all times but I haven't even gotten to the point where I use them so why are they on my screen?
It's like not intuitive. 
You have to scroll up and down a list of every single character and it's not even alphabetical or anything and not all of them have quests so it's like retarded that there's no separate list of ""current objectives"" And the one sentence of what to do just backfires because I have no clue who I'm supposed to go to, to retrieve the materials needed. 
Same goes for construction. Not alphabetical. Pain in the ass to navigate menus.


Edit: 
I shouldn't have to use the wiki to figure out how to get a bronze star book that doesn't have a red hard cover to build a lectern. Why would the lectern display an item that I cannot retrieve. Why would the crafting desk not show the option to craft a soft cover book? The wiki doesn't even get everything right. This game has so much crap in it, the one resource designed to keep track of it gets confused in certain places.

The money grind sucks. The only profitable things are harvesting bodies and burning them or fishing. The fishing in this game is boring and hard to see. The body harvesting is also waiting for a bell to ding'a'ling. 

The way stamina works is also tedious, because even if you have items that refill it, if you use a certain amount without sleeping you are forced to sleep which slows you down, forcing you to return home or the nearest rest spot.

I can only down 6 jars of honey before my character befalls to fatigue. Speaking of honey, there's nowhere to sell it. The only purpose it yields is cheap and affordable healing and stamina for dungeons. 

The dungeons are also tedious with how much wasted space there is. Same goes for the underground network of hallways. So much wasted space. A good opportunity for decoration options. A good opportunity of opening up a wall for easy accessibility. 

Why can you unlock zombie workstations before zombie workers? 
Why are there multiple cut scenes where you just straight up die? 
Why does it take forever for the blacksmith to financially recover from buying over 600 pieces of coal from me, but the fisherman restocks the next day with more coin than he had the day before after I sell him an inventory of gold and silver salmon? 
Why can't this game keep consistent?

Like seriously. If the quests given to you at any point in the game are accessible to you for early game rewards and tutorial like direction of what to do next, the game would be fine. The problem with this game is that regardless of how close you are to the next bit of progression, being tasked to do something impossible at the current stage in the game.
As well as quests sending you ever which direction, diverging you from the main quest you were going down. Your resources get stretched thin, which you can sure grind for, but the grind isn't fun.
the grind should be fun. 

I don't enjoy being pushed around by item drops as I farm them requiring me to move to go back to idling. seriously, harvesting river sand is a pain in the ass because even if I can harvest 10 in two scoops, I keep getting bumped and I have to walk away and go back and the first dig is always three scoops which takes away 1 durability and my mother f*cking time.
Same goes for mining. I can understand that more, but it's RNG where the stone slabs drop so sometimes you can go uninterrupted for 12 slabs or get shoved after 2. 
Sand should not displace where I am standing. Neither should clay. 

It's also annoying there's not a very good way of shoving logs laterally. Vertically moving slabs and logs is a piece of cake. There's no way of making a train of shoving these items to their depots. 

Idk. I like playing these kinds of games, but these kinds of games have everything that people that don't like playing these games have. This is mainly a review for my friends that hate survival games with mining and crafting elements.",1677965953,1678208623,False,43,5,0.588832557201385498,9,True,False,False

The dungeon exploration and combat also doesn't feel great, and it also seems to be included for game completion and weren't really polished or iterated on. But its an INDY GAME

There's potential for speed running the game, it took me a full ingame year to beat it. The ending is anticlimactic though. I don't usually like games where most of the achievements are paywalled behind DLC, and may revisit this game when the DLC goes on sale. 

The game play loop is based around limited inventory space, and resources to unlock the tech tree. The game is unusually open ended in that you can specialize in some play strategies, ignore others and still progress towards the endgame. That said, there isn't really an endgame. Do the astrologer quest line earlier, to avoid a 3-4 hour waiting game at the end. Kind of grindy at points.

Lots of fun mechanics and so many different parts of the world to explore. I love taking care of my graveyard and trying to make it as nice as possible while running around and doing a million other things.

I recently bought all three of the DLCs and am having fun with the pieces of the world that those added.

My only critique is that development of skills can feel a bit too linear and there are several tasks that I feel come about before you can reasonably access technology required to accomplish them and that the ending of the game fell a bit flat for me.

Turns out it does not! Turns out this game is tedious from beginning to whatever point you finally give up on it!

The problem I used to keep giving up on is that you generate more resources than you can use with very little effort, only to discover that most of these resources can't even be sold--nor can many of the products you make with those resources, except [i]maybe[/i] to an NPC who's only in town one day a week. And once you get to dungeon-delving, there's exactly one shortcut allowed, and that's picking which floor you start on once you've cleared more than one. If you're mid-floor and have to leave, you've gotta hike alllllll the way back to the stairs, and if anything ever changes that, it doesn't come soon enough.

On top of the tediousness and wastefulness, the game just feels half-finished in too many places. The base game contains various references to things that it turns out can only be found in DLC, which is frustrating, distracting, and confusing at best. There are numerous incredibly basic grammatical errors that should have been patched out before they released even a single DLC, let alone three. There are characters who only exist to do one thing, and then hang around uselessly for the entire rest of the game. There are characters whose early dialogues promise literally anything you might follow up on, only for them to never bring it up again. I finally just looked up the ending of the game when I decided I was done trying to reach it myself, and that's as big a fucking cop-out as everything else.

Anyway, long story short is I bought this game with high hopes, but it turns out the only thing that doesn't suck is the aesthetic. If you love yourself, save your money for another game.",1677217125,1677217125,False,2,0,0.497925341129302979,0,True,False,False

[b]That I love?[/b] Graphics, musical accompaniment, humor, a bunch of different activities (even if they are similar, even if it is a minus and a plus).

[b]What I do not like?[/b] An artificial plot.

I understand that this game is not about the story, as it is terribly miserable, but it is, as a ""rear scene"" is quite good, but if you want to end the game for some reason ... The whole problem here is that in order to pass it, even with everything you need, you are delayed in a special way - 15 levels of the dungeon (although 8 would be enough at most), ""come back in a week"", build a bunch of things, build a bunch of things, etc.
Spoiler: [spoiler]thank God there is a teleportation stone, zombie helpers and a place for meditation (and once there were none).[/spoiler]

The whole game can be described as follows: you need to get *THIS*, and to get *THIS* you need to make an elixir from the blood of a virgin and goulash from a unicorn, but first you need to learn this elixir in the technology tree, and to learn it - score enough points, and in order to score enough points - complete a routine (but not all routines fit because you don't need all the points), also don't forget that you need a *special table* to make this elixir, and another *special table* is needed to grind these ingredients , and for this you need ... etc.
You may object: you can buy it there!
And I will answer: But what about the certificate of an aristocrat?

How can this be resolved? Add two modes: one for fast progression of the game, the other for slow progression (or all sandboxes with required tasks).

It's a pity (the number of achievements received by the end of the game falls, apparently many people quit the game, is it worth it?)

In its current state it is a bloated grindfest with no sense of meaningful progression or rewarding pay-off. The core gameplay loop is almost non-existent other than: 
1) attempt to acquire skill/upgrade/gear
2) realise you need to grind to acquire it 
3) realise you can't even grind efficiently because what you need to grind that grind is locked behind another upgrade wall 
4) pivot and try to grind something else to forget about the grind that you can't even actually grind.
5) repeat forever

It's hugely frustrating and really unrewarding. The game is bloated with a lot of (admittedly cool) features that are underdeveloped or far too drawn out. It borrows a lot of tropes from Stardew Valley without any of the polish or satisfaction to achieve. 

The game focusses on the grind - and that's okay. A lot of games rely on the grind. However most other games make the grind focussed, finite, and at least a bit rewarding. Graveyard Keeper has none of this. 

It is a cute game, with fun art style and nice music that subtly enhances the experience. That's... about all that's good about it.",1534473227,1676939181,False,4,0,0.485829770565032959,0,True,False,False

It is a relaxing game that you can play at your own pace, with no pressure or stress. From the minute you start playing, you'll be captivated by the beautiful art style and sound design, which creates a unique atmosphere that draws you in and immerses you in the world.

The gameplay is simple and intuitive, which makes it easy for anyone to pick up and play. The mechanics are well-balanced, which creates a satisfying experience as you progress through the game. You can take on a variety of tasks, from farming to crafting, and the game is designed to encourage you to explore and experiment with different strategies to achieve your objectives.

The art style is exceptional, with detailed character models, gorgeous landscapes, and vibrant colors. The sound design is equally impressive, with a soundtrack that perfectly captures the game's mood and tone. The combination of these two elements makes GK a visually stunning game that's a pleasure to play.

Regarding the DLC, they are not „required” and you can choose when to start them at any point you like. But, for the sake of it. 

Stranger Sins adds some depth to the story, I would advise to get it BEFORE you finish your first pt
Game Of Crones should be started near the end of the game, that s cuz you have a lot of things to do there and it can become frustrating to handle everything 
Better Save Souls ads some depth to the story and utility with the ... you ll see, I think it should be get with the Stranger Sins 

I also think that you should get all 3 of them if you enjoy the first 30 mins of the game and just start their content whenever you feel ready

At first glance it might look similar to Stardew Valley and such, which is false. It has a story to progress through and gathering, crafting and building is more the focus that farming. Once you arrive at automation of your farm, you barely give it any second thought unless you need something from it for a recipe.
I’d recommend getting the game together with the DLCs. Not only will you get more story context from them, but they also provide alternative solutions to some things in the main story as well as giving you more to-do variety. Last but not least it is generally better to play them while going through the main game and not at the end, you get more out of them and it won’t be tedious from waiting.
Do look up beginner’s tips if not a beginner’s guide as you might easily be lost at the start otherwise. You can’t really soft lock yourself, but there are mistakes that would be very tedious to correct like spending blue points in the wrong place while you don’t have a good source for them yet.
The graphics are lovely and the character and environmental design is really pleasant to look at. Likewise the music is very fitting for the atmosphere and almost meditative most of the time.
I really enjoyed the story and how it connects different people. It really tugs on your heartstrings here and there, but is still quite humorous! It’s a bit of a grey humour, but not particularly dark in my opinion.
Not to spoil the ending, all I will say is that there is great sequel potential here!
To sum it up, I highly recommend this game for any enjoyers of somewhat grindy casual game with a great story.

Has a lot of grinding, which could be ok if you didn't get lost all the time because all objectives have long term rewards instead of short term.
And by that I mean the game lacks ingame tracking of recipes, like having to memorize the amount of materials for stuff (other building games do this better by having a ""blueprint"" first, and all planned blueprint materials are tracked on screen wherever you may go), or having to remember which NPC you have to progress (and why) so it can unlock a chain of other NPC unlocks.

Still fun, the story is fun and the characters have personality.

One of the standout features of Graveyard Keeper is the deep crafting system that allows you to create a variety of items and upgrades to help you run your graveyard. Whether you're digging graves, making funerary arrangements, or crafting tools, the game's mechanics are well-designed and engaging.

The game's graphics and soundtrack are also top-notch, creating a fully-realized world that is both eerie and charming. The world of Graveyard Keeper is filled with interesting characters, each with their own motivations and personalities, making it a joy to explore and interact with.

The only downside to this game is that some skills are locked behind a DLC paywall. While the base game offers a lot of content, some players may feel that they need to purchase additional content to fully experience everything that the game has to offer.

Overall, Graveyard Keeper is a must-play for fans of simulation games and RPGs. The combination of dark humor, engaging gameplay, and deep crafting system make it a standout in the genre.

Within the first 10 minutes you are hit with a ton of information, there is no quick checklist/journal for quests; so you have to go into the menu and scroll down to each NPC to see what it is they need and even then, those items or quests aren't expanded upon. One NPC needs an item but you aren't told how to find or require it, so I had to do a lot of googling and even some of that information wasn't 100% clear. I don't know whether these issues are things that are fixed in some of the DLC packs but it really needs addressing the base game. Also if you need to craft or fix something but don't have the ingredients in your inventory or a nearby chest, you aren't able to do it and have to walk all the way back to where you've stored them.

Excellent sense of humor in the game. Graphics are really cute, story is fun, side quests we'rent too overwhelming, and easy to pick up and get playing. 

Honestly, I was surprised, I figured this would be alot more like other titles, but I found this game to be unique in alot of ways with the story and tasks in game. Of course there is farming, and fishing, but there is alot of expanded areas with the church, graveyard, dungeons and other side quests. Which was a nice surprise I've really liked so far. - I don't really want to put out spoilers, but this title is not your average farming game, it has some very dark twists, and unique game play.

I think my only criticisms is the day cycle is a little short, which results in things feeling a bit rushed at times. Plus, the tutorials were a little difficult to understand ( but maybe it's just me). It took some looking things up to get an understanding of the game beyond the basics.

I didn't encounter any game-breaking bugs, though there are at least two achievements that are miss-able if you don't know about them ahead of time. Overall still enjoyed it despite the criticisms below, and would recommend it to fans of the genre, especially on sale. Though as soon as possible in game learn how to craft speed potions (coupled with sauerkraut for buff duration), I don't know if I would have finished the game without them.

The main criticism of the game is that it's designed to make you grind, and often I felt like it was intentionally wasting my time, as many of the quests (especially the DLC) have you running all over the map back and forth doing fetch quests, or grinding up the materials to be able to complete them.

The intent of the grinding I'm assuming is that it makes the various upgrades and automation feel satisfying. This is true for the most part. However, they didn't go far enough. Many crafting recipes needed for full completion of the game cannot be automated, and on top of that, for certain important recipes you have to manually open the crafting menu, select the recipe, select the ingredients you want, and start the crafting for each individual item, which is painfully tedious, especially when the crafting is time based (cooking recipes).

For the automation, it's missing some key features you might expect from an automation mechanic. Such as; you can queue up crafting jobs, even make them repeat infinitely, but you can't set conditions for the jobs like ""Craft X planks when planks in storage are less than X"", so unless you want to fill your entire storage with planks, you still have to queue them up yourself each time you need more.

I played about 90% of the base game before buying the DLC, and I'm not sure if I would recommend that. The DLC integrates fine at any point of the story, but the core mechanic of a couple of the features of the DLC requires game time to pass and a certain amount of grinding to complete, so doing that alongside the base game's grinding would help make it not so grind-heavy at the end.",1676154591,1676154591,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

It's a decently put together game. No show stopping bugs.

However ... quality of life really needs to be improved. Maybe I'm just impatience / ""lazy"" but this game needs a quest tracker that shows quest objectives. I can't be bother to keep in my head all the various active quests and their requirements, not after 9-5, and it's really sucking the joy out of playing for me.

It's also possible to get semi-stuck, where progress slows to a crawl and it's quite difficult to recover, if you screw up and make bad decisions with regards to resource use. Normally this is fine if all the cards are on the table and clearly displayed, but with quest tracking being in the state it's in, it's difficult to keep track of the quest objectives thus it's difficult to devise a plan as to how to spend your resources to accomplish them.

Wish I didn't ignore the fact that the game was 60-70% off for months, and instead ask why. I bought mainly as a comfy game to play on the Steam Deck and it's been mediocre.

The game is pretty tedious. Lots of collecting resources over and over. Character walks slowly and there's obstructions everywhere for no reason. For example, you often go back and forth between graveyard and morgue, but annoyingly there is a long fence with no convenient doorway. You have to always go around it which almost doubles your trip. Same for vineyard, the cliff blocking it and your gardening area.

Hardly any QoL. Click click click. Some recipes let you pick ingredient quality, which means you have to make them one by one. Even more clicking. The crafting UI is not good btw.

There is lots of production chain spam. For example, there's like 10-15 types of wood like wood planks, rough planks, stumps, wedges, etc... It doesn't really matter, it's all just fodder for recipes. But the problem is that each one is made specifically at one of the ~5 woodworking stations. So you have to keep running between the stations trying to find which one has the recipe you want.

The building system is very restrictive. Forces you to just make a messy jumble of craft stations. Always gives you a few tiny islands of buildable areas, and what you can build is highly location specific. The vineyard for example doesn't let you build a box so you can keep fertilizer and seeds in it. So you have to keep running back and forth to the garden area which does. Can't move buildings either and deconstructing wastes a lot of resources. The cellar, which apparently is basically only good for wine barrels, gives you 9x4 buildable areas when wine barrels are 4x4. UGH. Trolling people's OCD in this type of game, it's like, a cardinal sin of the genre.

No recipe book, no proper quest log, no useful tooltips on items, no explanation on the tech tree. There are HUNDREDS of crafting recipes and you have to look each one up on the wiki. How do you make a crafting game without a builtin recipe index? Come on.

Overall, the game is extremely grindy and slow. You always have to work on multiple things because everything is locked behind artificial waits. It's easy to lose track of what you're doing.

Performance is crap. I don't know how you manage that with a pixel game, but there it is. On the Deck with SteamOS, you get max 1280p resolution. You can barely see the whole UI with that. For the bottom of the tech tree, the tooltips get cut off. Lol! It's also a huge pain to even change the resolution, it glitches out a lot and you have to find a very specific way to do it by trial and error. If you switch to desktop mode you can use whatever resolution you want, but now there's weird stutters and tearing issues, and you start getting 30-40 fps. Yes, in a 2D game! I get better performance in Elden Ring FFS.

Basically, the vanilla game is bad and even at $10 it will feel like a letdown. With all the DLCs (I hear), you actually have like 80% of a real game, although still with flaws (DLC isn't going to fix the crappy graphics code). But now you've paid like $60 for a $15 experience. And still there will be stuff left in the game that's incomplete. Sounds like 1/3 of the issues the game had in 2018 are still not fixed 5 years later. Don't bother buying this, it's an exercise in frustration.

I like concept of the game, There are some jokes we all knew but funny to see. Each DLC stories nice, but some of the endings not makes me happy, I prefer some deeper knowledge or little bit better ending, or reward.

Every DLC come with different positive game play it is really nice but there are no growing or end game. I wish dungeon reset itself to early play and player can get more items they need. I prefer DLC's open themselves  after important points of the main game. Because when you start those at the nearly same time all stories cross themselves in some manner and create some kind of confusion.

There are minor bugs, like you can not see the what NPC wants in their quests, you need to be carefully listen and take a not, its not bother me but in long time gab it might be bothersome.

I wish I can change or fix some other things more freely like farm or my crafting area. I wish to fix stone walls or quarry house or some other fixing crafting etc. 

I'm a big hoarder and I couldn't sell most of the items, its little bit bothering but I guess it is good for the game economic, be careful what you craft and collect don't be like me.

Game asking grinding if you don't like grinding  you might not like some of the achievement, but you can finish the game with  little grinding too of course with planing :)

TL:DR I'll give 7/10 fun to play, concept is nice sound is nice some of the ghouls are weird, but every day I'm shoveling (yeah bad joke I know)

The achievements are well made to not be painful or miles off the beaten path (with the exception of 200 fish), and pretty much nothing in the game relies on chance.

- scales to absurd complexity
- necessary external notes or VERY good memory
- constant internet searching necessary
- ""impossible"" to pick up again
- bad performance on Steam Deck 

I don't hate it there we're some good things, just there are far better games on this genre out there so I don't feel like recommending this one too anyone.
If you asked me the first few days after I started playing I would eagerly recommend the game to you. I was addicted, it started small and simple with frequent rewards and fast progress. But after a while everything slows down and gets extremely complex to the point that you're not sure if it's fun or a chore anymore.
The world is enormous, everything is far apart, you need different recourses and tools from facilities at different places in the world. So you ping from one place to another, God forbid you forget to bring something because you actually need to remember like 100 things at the same time. The small inventory and limited unorganized storage system of scattered chests and shelves doesn't help either.
Frequent searching on wiki about where to find or how to craft stuff or what to do with some new item is practically necessary.

About the performance, first of all the loading is ultra long, both starting the game and loading the save takes forever.
After start you'll get smooth 60 fps no problem. But then the performance gradually slows down a halt. 50, 40, 30, 25... fps with dips and lags. Basically you'll need to save a restart every few hours or so.
I find unacceptable from a 2D game with pixel graphics. Most AAA titles runs better even with the Proton layer.

I'll end it on this. After a few days of active playing with everything fresh in mind I got to a point. Then I couldn't play for while, not long just a weekend or so. But when I picked it up again I was completely lost, and also ever bit of fun remaining was gone. I still wanted to finish the game as it felt like I was close but I genuinely didn't feel like diving into that chaos again ... so I just turned it off.

I was avoiding this graveyard ""manager"" for a while due to its morbid theme but was very pleasantly surprised when I finally jumped in and saw how lighthearted and stress-free it actually is. An amazing game!

(+) Focused story with straight-to-the-point dialogues and fun, minimalist cutscenes.
(++) Very well designed progression - new mechanics reveal every time you're about to start to feel the grind.
(++) No time limits (only maybe corpses rot but there are many ways to deal with it or ... in the end, you can just throw them away or cremate them without any punishment whatsoever). You get to your crops when you want, you'll do your quests when you feel like it.
(++) The game doesn't force you to do many things that ""one specific way"". There are alternate solutions to many problems and quests. You can get by however you feel like, and even for the progression's sake, you can obtain almost anything just by buying it if you, e.g. don't enjoy farming and don't want to spend your progression points or time on growing that perfect pumpkin.
(++) This is a stress-free game you play on your own terms, a game where you go fishing in the afternoon, write books in your cellar until the morning sun, and then sleep past the golden hour. Or maybe you try-hard and farm from morning to lunch and drag around logs of wood before dinner. You do you.
(+) Higher resolution pixel art, easy to read, also very well done stylistically. Very nicely implemented atmosphere effects (lighting, fog,...)

(--) Performance issues (yes, this pixel art game has performance issues on high-end PCs). Mostly in dungeons however, where you're not required to spend all that much time.
(--) Still some bad habits of the genre. Walking to some locations (you need to visit often) eats too much of your day and is very dull in general. Some fetch quest are too fetch-questy, especially when combined with the aforementioned issue (let's say you finally get to that dude on the other side of the map to give him the thing he wanted just so that he can tell you he wants one more thing you actually do have in your box at home, so now the whole quest is basically ""now go all the way home again and come all the way back again."")
(-) The end-game save state is the classical save-before-your-last-cutscene. All your potential end-game activities (incl. the DLCs) are thus before-the-end-game activities which might deprive many players of the motivation to actually participate in them.",1675638528,1675638528,True,6,0,0.509814321994781494,0,True,False,False

is it the perfect game? of course not. perfect games don't exist. but i still had a lot of enjoyment out of the game, which is honestly a huge reason why i would recommend this to people who enjoy management-style games.

the game has some interesting commentary on religion (specifically through Christian methods of worship) and morality in its presentation, and i don't hate it. the game allows you to have your own opinions on the themes and presentation, even if the main character has their own specific perspective and opinions. while not a huge part of the gameplay, the atmosphere and the vibes of the game use this for the setting of the story and that actually enhances the environment the game is trying to provide.

i would recommend going into this game with the expectation that you'll probably have to look stuff up once in a while, and that's okay! that's why wikis for games exist; to have players help other players find their own type of enjoyment.

all in all, while i know this game won't be appealing to everyone, give it a chance and see for yourself whether or not it's a game you'd enjoy.",1675496421,1675496421,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Missings FOR ME:
blueprints(learning/crafting) and building are a little bit boring. Almost every time i need using wikipage or SS.
Energy system is annoying. 
Inventory size, maybe backpack or increase size with tech.
You can't carry more than 1 item with your hand, maybe possible to use rope to carry?
Pluses:
Zombie workers :)
Tech tree.
DLCs.
Quests esp. church(bishop) ones.
Dungeon levels.

There's just no noticeable progress for the effort you put in.
You can never relax and enjoy your creations, it just stresses you out from one end of the map to the other.

This whole over complicated system just leads to a lot of GAMEBREAKING BUGS so you can't continue:
- Main quest NPCs are suddenly unavailable
- Quest items are not registered to complete quests.
- etc.

And that's the most annoying point in this game, it pretends a world with 1000 possibilities but in the end you're forced to follow a certain pre-made path to reach the end goals.

You can't even check quest text with NPC again to get deeper information. You either have a mastermind or work with pen and paper...

You will get no help in-game for what you need to do. There is no journal or quest log; the closest thing you have is the Known NPCs page, and half the time those don't tell you specifically what to do or how to do them, and the other half of the time they're just straight up not written down, or even useless (Yorick and the beer, Alaric and his needs). A great example: a character asks you to make ""roof tiles"" and ""curtains"". Neither of these are things you learn in your normal skill trees and you will have never, ever come across them before. The game tells you NOTHING. You have to figure out where to craft them yourself.

You WILL need the wiki, and the wiki itself is awful, too.

The Known NPCs page also constantly shuffles the characters around in no particular order, so you have to carefully scroll through the list to find who it is you need to talk to or do things for. This compounds the more DLC you add, too. 

There is no in-game ""blueprint"" section, so in order to figure out what you need to build something, you need to go to THAT crafting area and read the recipe there. This means many, many trips between faraway crafting sites and your home where you make your crafting material and tools. Alchemy crafting is a shot in the dark. The game gives you no hints as to what reagent to put in what spot in your alchemy table, so you're going to make useless goo a lot. Only a SUCCESSFUL recipe is written down--but again, only at the alchemy table, you can't reference it anywhere else.

If you do get through all that, the story is... incomplete. And bewildering. You'll have many questions, and the answers you are given either contradict each other (Clotho and her backstory seem to conflict between Stranger Sins and Game of Crone, for example) or lead nowhere meaningful (sorry, Gerry--which actually is ALSO contradicted between Stranger Sins and just the normal game ending!). It's pointless. Don't even try to make sense of it. This game relies on its mechanics as the hook, not its narrative.

This game will not allow achievements if you use mods, and boy, you will want to use mods (at the very minimum a sprint mod, jesus does Keeper walk at a leisurely pace), so weigh your options carefully.

Lastly for the HUGE negatives, the game has a nasty habit of padding its runtime with making you wait days or the full week to continue questlines, or using extremely tedious busywork. This is especially prevalent in Stranger Sins (you need to get the maguffin from this guy, but he wants a pony, so go talk to this guy, and HE'S pitching a fit because someone vandalized his shop, so you have to go fix it, and to fix it you need stuff you need to wait for some other guy for... yawn (not a literal example from the game)) and Game of Crone (wait for your refugee camp to become happy before you can build them a kitchen! Doesn't make sense? Too bad!).

The mechanics are fun, if you like grinding games--which I do, which is why I enjoyed it. The timewasting can be mitigated somewhat with your meditation spot, but that does not feel good whatsoever.

The best things about this game are the art and the music. It is also, in my opinion, far more relaxing than Stardew Valley. I know, I'm a heathen, but with GK at least you have no penalty whatsoever to missing someone or something on a given day, and the time cycle is only 6 days long. In SDV, I have to wait an entire year to get the chance again, and sometimes not even then, sometimes it's gone forever! It's stressful! Also, it has better music than Stardew Valley. LOOK I KNOW I AM A TERRIBLE PERSON, SDV is my favorite PC sim game but I hate the music. It's so cloyingly sweet. GK is far more grounded and darkly calm. And the art is absolutely amazing, easily the best part.

Anyway, do I recommend this? I like it, but no, I do not recommend it. Not unless you REALLY like grinding games, love googling for answers, and don't care about narrative payoff.

Get it at a steep discount, and same for the DLC (and I do recommend the DLC).",1675280723,1675280723,False,2,0,0.47999998927116394,0,True,False,False

as almost every review says it is very grindy in a way that if you want thing A you need to unlock B first and for that you need C and D which you can only get by doing E. after you unlocked a couple of things on the skilll tree this gets a bit better since you don't need that many technologies anymore. but the game play cycle stays the same. and this is the part i needed to learn before i was able to enjoy the game. the grind is just like that. the game won't get better or different. you will grind different things but you will never stop. but there is no rush in completing any quests or accessing anything. every in game week is the same, there are no seasons and if you spend the whole week chopping down trees and don't do any quests that that is fine and the game does not punish you for that. 

you will walk around a lot so i recooemd waiting for your second corpse before you go to the tavern and sell both certificates at once to get the teleport stone right away. it will make your life easier. and once you are far enough into the game to unlock alchemy just do yourself a favor and build a couple of storage units in the cellar and open the wiki. you won't remember all the ingredients you need and you will need to write them down or look them up all the time. you will need to write down a lot of crafting recipes from in game because the game has no way of pinning or marking them and you don't want to walk somewhere multiple times because you forgot to bring two nails or something.

so just relax, enjoy the vibes and walk around. the quests you get are not made so you can complete them just one after the other. for somethings you will need to wait and unlock quite a lot of things before you can do them but as i said you don't need to feel rushed. just do what you want and play the game at your own pace.

i got the game on sale and after a couple of weeks and playing about 30 hours i bought all dlc on sale too. the base game might be worth 20€ but i can't see 10€ being justified for every DLC. i spent hundreds of hours in stardew and that game is only 15€.  with all DLC Graveyard Keeper would be 50€ and while it is a solid game (i haven't found any bugs) this is too much in my opinion. on sale i got everything for under 20€ and i think this is fine especially if you aren't sure you would like it. the dlc are all good and fit very nicely into the story of the base game. since i was neither finished with the main story nor just starting a new game it went well with my routine and helped immensely with ressources, money and managing everything.

- Stranger SIns -
you build your own tavern in this one and it's the money making that makes this worth buying. just make wine and put it on the shelves and you won't have to worry about money again. don't bother with beer it's more difficult to make and sells for less. the story is okay but since i haven't finished it i won't say much to it.

- Game of Crone -
manage a refugee camp and help them. i had the most fun with this dlc and it is worth buying for getting the backpacks which will help you manage your inventory and once you build the garden and cooking place the camp won't need you to add any food but you can take food from the warehouse if you like. in mine they have hundreds of pieces of dough i can turn into bread if i need to. i enjoyed the party of the story i have seen so far the most.

- Better Save Soul -
great story, i really like the ability to manage work stations remotely for example i can tell zombies in the quarry what to break down or choose what to cook in the oven while i am in the church. at first the soul extracting was confusing to me, you have to but the corpse here first because the soul will wither very quickly and then you won't be able to get anything from it

For newer players I would say the only DLC really helpful is Stranger Sins for the Tavern that can help build up passive income by selling Wine (beer is too cheap and needs way more resources.) 

Goal? To simply play through the game seeing what interests you and go from there. The DLCs help add goals and things to do while your main objective is to complete the six main quests: Character interactions to get items needed to finish a ritual to have the Graveyard Keeper go home.

if you happen to have a working mod app, quality of life improvement mods will make things a lot easier for you! Not being able to stack bronze, silver, or gold star recipes is very annoying and kills a lot of motivation to even bother with it. Also fishing is pointless. not needed at all when Wine is pretty much 'thanks for playing the game, now for easy mode!'

Money wise; you only need maybe a total of maybe 15 gold to finish the game? I can't recall for sure, but once you have wine making and the Tavern selling said wine you'll be rolling in cash before you even finish the six major story lines.

All DLCs:
~Breaking Dead: I believe this is free on Steam but may cost extra on the consoles. I recall paying for it on Switch. Adds Zombie Helpers making gathering easier to help stream line long processes.
~Stranger Sins: Adds the Talking Skull Tavern to sell Wine and other products when you host events. Easy passive income.
~Game of Crones: Adds the Refugee Camp. Help them build a new village, get recipes for extra storage bags (HUGE HELP) unique and higher quality gravestones for the Graveyard.
~Better Save Soul: Adds the Soul Room. Cleansing the Souls of the Dead gives you shards to increase the white and red skulls on organs, while souls passed onto the afterlife will give you gratitude that can be spent to make tasks from other locations. Requires you to Cleanse Pride from you new NPC friend.",1675206094,1675206094,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Similar to stardew valley visually although with a unique concept and story. In the beginning I was having fun with the game exploring the mechanics and map but my gameplay slowly started to evolve, especially towards the end, into more of grinding game in an unfun way. Also honestly there wasn't much content as I expected, and the content that was in the game got repetitive. After I completed the ways of getting and crafting the advanced resources and materials then it was just crafting those resources for quests and there wasnt alot of creativity possible. The addition of no real tutorial/crafting book made alchemy and most things really difficult without the use of the wiki. Finally, I found the ending of the game underwhelming the whole game and purpose of the story is finally achieved the you feel no excitement or anything for completing it.

I've been waiting a long time for it to go on sale and it finally did so I grabbed it. There is so much to do and learn with this game. So much so I find my second monitor open strictly to Graveyard Keeper guides because there is little instruction in the game on how to do things and what to unlock to get what. Luckily there are many MANY guides to help you through the game. I still haven't figured out everything about it and I'm sure it'll take a very long time to do so, but I have enjoyed what I have played so far. 

However, I feel that the game days are WAY too short. I barely get anything done in a day because of how short they are; I do however, like that you can only get to certain people on certain days. That makes working on certain things an interesting concept because it slows down getting certain things done in the game because of the ability to only see certain NPCs on certain days. 

My two big cons:
One, I just wish for more instruction in the gameplay. I don't fully like having to rely on google so much for how to do or get things in the game.
Two, the length of the days to be longer.

I purchased all the DLC and had a good time with the game, though I definitely stopped myself from having an easier time by trying to hold off on certain activities. Pretty grindy and the ending wasn't particularly satisfying, but a good experience overall.

My advice for you going into this:
- Just use Zombies when you get them, don't wait until you can make the perfect zombies
- Don't throw corpses in the river, burn them so you can get early money from the burial certificates
- Don't wait until you can make perfect corpses to start burying them. Just do it from the start with OK corpses and it'll be just as worthwhile.",1675156511,1675156511,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The talking skull that is supposed to act as a tutorial character who walks you through the steps of the game does absolutely nothing. He shows you some places and you get a couple tutorial boxes and then he never talks to you again. I felt that Gerry was promised to be a companion character and teacher but actually is mainly just decoration. Gerry will ask for beer to help his memory in exchange for more help. When you bring him the item requested he doesn't like it and you can't talk to him at any point afterwards. This one of the many instances that you will work for an item to give someone with the promise that you will get help, access to a new location, or progression of story only to find that they won't help you, the location could never be accessed, and the story won't progress in any meaningful way.

You will find that most of the things you have to do will require you to consult the wiki and other guides because there is no tutorial for how most things work, and you will never receive any explanation or information to help you understand what to do and what it happening. I frequently thought that my game had to be bugged due to issues but no, that's just how the game is.

Your energy never improves so throughout the whole game you have to constantly be stopping to eat food or run inside to your bed for more energy. It's very tedious.

The game promises two other locations that you actually never get to see.  The town gate will require a town pass and that can be bought near the church but when you go to the gate you will be struck by lightning and your town pass destroyed. The town is not a location you ever see or get to visit. You will waste time and money purchasing the required item to go nowhere. Same with the Mountain Fort. 

NPC's are promised to be characters you can get to know and eventually enter there houses. You will see a relationship bar in the top left. You can not improve the relationship nor get to know the vast majority of characters. I don't know why they are there if they aren't for any good, but that is also a recurring issue with the game. 

I think the biggest reason you shouldn't waste your money on this is that even if you get through the entire the game and the screen fades to black Gerry will pop up and complain about the lack of content. He mentions that you don't even get to see the town and says ""Is that it?"". Another character repsonds and the Gerry laughs about how I guess that means more room for DLC. Which gave me the distinct impression that the developer(s) know about the shortcomings of there game and instead of addressing the issues with the base game are instead going to create DLC, presumably for more money.",1675100810,1675100810,False,3,0,0.541984736919403076,0,True,False,False

O jogo vale apena ao torno de 20 reais, acima sai muito caro, e abaixo é uma pechinxa

Vamos la tem varios pontos positivos e negativos.

Positivos:
Você pode jogar o jogo no seu tempo, sem se preocupar com estações como no stardew valley
Um burro comunista te vende corpos em troca de cenouras.
Você cuida de um cemitério e pode remover a carne dos mortos e fazer hambúrguer e vender na cidade.
Você pode ter zumbis e esses zumbis fazem as coisas para você
Arte do jogo é boa, mas não é melhor do que isso

neutros:
O jogo pode aparentar ser grind, então há pessoas e pessoas, no começo você tem muita coisa para fazer, no midgame, voce chega a perder o controle e perde-se nas tarefas de tanta coisa para fazer, e perto do fim fica meio monótono porque não sobra quase mais nada a se fazer

A parte em que voce precisa juntar 12 moedas de ouro para de tornar um aristocata é extremamente grind, mas depois disso, não há mais nada para fazer, provavelmente você já teria feito tudo.

Negativo:
Perto do final do jogo, você vai ter que meditar pra caramba pra não se sentir sufocado de tanto esperar os dias passarem.
A Musica é boa, mas depois de um tempo se torna extremamente repetitiva.
O final do jogo e sua conclusão é bonitinho, mas acaba abruptamente, não tendo como continuar apartir do final, voce perde o progresso e continua desde o ultimo save se tentar jogar novamente. Poderia simplesmente ter um encerramento ou continuar de onde parou.

1. This game has a serious pacing issue. I can't tell how many times I found myself just waiting for the right day to roll over so I could continue with the story line. And I think it's inevitable that anyone who plays this game reaches that point. Yes, I could choose to do other things while I wait for time to pass, but this brings up another point...

2. There's too many steps from wanting/needing something to getting it. By the time you get something you need, you have completely forgotten why you needed it in the first place. No worries, you can just take a look in the ""quests""/""tasks"" tab, right? Well...

3. On one hand, the tasks system is severely lacking in information. Most of the time, you have no clue where to even begin looking for the thing you need, so you have to look it up in the wiki. On the other hand, sometimes the game decides to spell out exactly where to go or which person to talk to. Every time I needed to do some investigating, I would get excited that I figured out who to talk to next just by the dialog! And then, my character would tell me anyways, just in case I didn't get it.

4. There is SO much walking. And the graveyard keeper is SO slow. It wouldn't matter as much if there wasn't so much going back and forth from one place to another in order to achieve anything. There are means to get to places faster, but...

5. The game doesn't try to improve your QOL at all. In fact, it seems like it tries its best to hide the things which will make you enjoy it more.

I have a lot of other gripes with this game, but these are the main ones. It's a shame, too, since the story is actually very enjoyable, it's just surrounded by bad game mechanics.",1675039575,1675039575,False,7,0,0.560209393501281738,0,True,False,False

The pixel artwork is popular at the moment, and it's easy to start ignoring these as 'just another pixel game', however, this one is detailed and rich enough to exude the nostalgic, retro, vibes many other wannabes fail to achieve. It could do with the option to pin any of the many crafting recipes to the HUD, so you remember what the hell you're doing, and a few more teleport options (maybe more become available later in the game). Sometimes there is a lack in direction and it can become tiresome to try and figure it out without any pointers or clues.

The game itself besides what you see from the screenshots and gameplay has a main issue of item bloat. And also recipe bloat. The progression path primarily consists of you going ""I want this thing!"" And then realizing you cannot do that for another 50 hours because you have to farm up gold tier onions and gold tier hops to get special organs needed for blue points. But you also have to farm up the special materials necessary for gold tier fertilizer and crops. But you also have to grind reputation to get the seeds. But you also have to craft and unlock all major alchemy crafting tables and stations. But you also have to unlock special crafting items needed to build those alchemy crafting tables you unlocked. 

Its this huge chasing your tail and falling into another wall because the game doesnt really give you the best advice. 

Despite this i still really enjoyed the game. The wild goose chase and nonstop farming and manual labor always felt pleasing because the art-style is pretty and the music is calming. 

Thats the game at its core i believe. I would have 30 wiki pages open and notepads writing down step by steps of what is necessary in the moment to progress. And I enjoyed that, not something everyone will like in fact id say this is why people often dump the game 2-10 hours in. 


I mentioned item bloat didnt I? Yeah that 
90% of all the foods, potions, alchemist ingredients, plants, forage-able food, farmables plants, and church prayers are completely meaningless. This game has 10-15 buffs for combat in the form of potions, prayers and food buffs. All of them were mostly meaningless in the long run. There is no point to having so much combat buffs when you only need the final tier of weapon and armor and a ton of fish stew to blow through the entire dungeon in one run then NEVER fight anything else ever again because the dungeon ends. Its strange. 

Fishing had more content than the dungeon and it only had 2 food buffs and thats it. So strange. Buy some rods and baits from the fisher lighthouse man buy the two foods from the tavern and boom you max rank fisherman. 

If I ever do a second play-through i think i would have far more fun actually knowing how the game works.

It would benefit from a better mission view that you could toggle on/off the screen.

Way points would be great for fast travelling as walking around really burns daylight although the teleport stone is great - the cool down is really a bummer - but still good to have. 

Overall a great game that would definitely benefit with a few tweaks here and there.

Zombies are amazing and try to get a zombie at the quarry for stone, a porter at the quarry and then a zombie (and a porter) at the big tree to produce infinite stone and logs.

Other than that, have fun, design your graveyard and figure out everything you can. It gets better as time goes on and you figure out more of the systems.",1674712561,1674712561,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've played for a few months but it's recently become laggy. I had to look up a walk through because so many things you need to do aren't in the NPC description and aren't 'common sense', like recipes for different elixirs. Fortunately walk throughs are easy to find. I wish there were an extra tab for errands you need to do and things you need to make / get for NPCs. Would make grave digger life a lot easier.

- Translations are sometimes really bad or missing
- No official mod support
- Sometimes tedious
- Some game breaking bugs

The main drawback in my opinion was that some parts were quite tedious, though it did add to the total duration of content so it depends a bit on what you like.  For example,[spoiler] if you don't start collecting skulls before Snake tells you what they are for, or you don't sell beer and burgers with the Inquisitor during witch burnings[/spoiler], it will set you back on progress on those quests and they will feel quite tedious if you have no other quests to work on.  There is a surprising amount of side stuff you can do and even after 57 hours of gameplay and finishing the game, there were some parts of the game I didn't get a chance to fully explore.  Another thing that was significantly annoying was the inability to queue or make multiples of tiered goods, which I would strongly encourage devs to be possible to do as it just made certain goods not really worth making as it was too tedious.

If you let the time pass in the game, you won't lose any event (I guess only the witch burnings where you put up a shop that you lose);

 *contains spoilers*

It was riveting being a graveyard keeper. Game got me hooked from the start. Not only because I really wanted to know why you had to be one after dying (isekai? lmao), but because there's so much more than just burying bodies and eventually raising zombies to work for you. 

Before I knew it, I was already a 100 days in -- roughly maybe 21 hours of playtime and I've barely scratched the surface! Well, mostly because I didn't know what I was doing haha. This is especially true when crafting and building stuff early on. And yes, I have to warn you, you need to have lots of patience and dedication cos you'll have to grind your way to make some progress in the story. And by grind, I mean constantly farming, foraging, grave keeping, maintenance, crafting, researching etc. You name it.. even dungeon runs (more on that later)! You do get help after a while after unlocking the zombies which is really something to look forward to haha

some excerpt I had with myself during my early days ig: 
""Oh I need to build a wooden anvil so I can craft simple iron parts?""
""Wait, it also requires simple iron parts? wtf?!""
""But I need to build this first so I can craft it!"" 
""Where else can I get simple iron parts?""

The blacksmith. Apparently. You dummy. duh,

I regularly faced this dilemma which was a bit frustrating ngl whether it was building or crafting. Not to mention, I only knew about the teleportation stone after a 100+ games! I wasn't able to do quests in time and had to wait another week in game just to progress each npc's story. Man I could have saved so much time @!#$. 

But yeah that's on me for not exploring haha cos by design, the game really doesn't spoon feed and guide you on everything. It gives a few notes here and there, but you are on your own to learn how to do most of  things so you gotta explore. *ehem* alchemy *ehem* . Unless, you're a lazy uncultured swine who googles and wikis everything. I won't judge tho! 

And ofc it's debatable whether this ""design"" is fun or not. The tech tree was straightforward. Nothing to add here. I think it was pretty solid, but like the crafting and building and such, it might be a little too overwhelming for some. 

Dialogue was pretty funny. Sometimes dark, sometimes deserved an eye roll but overall, it made the game more quirky and fun. It doesn't take itself too seriously. Some chuckles to look forward to.  

I do wish there was more dialogue especially for other npcs in the base game. The village would feel so much more alive especially since the map felt empty and barren in a lot of parts. So much potential there unused, but maybe it was intentional cos devs wanted them as DLCs. CAPITALISM as donkey would say!

Trade tier system was meh. It's not as rewarding as I'd hoped it'd be. Cos yeah no dialog, you just unlock new things to trade.

Ah and yes, there's a dungeon you eventually have to clear. I have to be frank tho, I'm not really a fan. Levels felt repetitive and there's really not much going on. No boss levels, maybe a few notable monsters but that's it really. You clear the level by killing everything there. It's kinda rewarding, but not at the same time. 

What can I say? Gameplay is not perfect, but it's better than your average rpg simulation game I suppose. There's so much to do, so much to unravel, you won't notice time fleeting by unless you're stuck and you don't know what to do next haha.

Soundtrack and sound bits, pretty swell. Love the donkey bell and the satisfying sound of earning tech points.

Oh and btw on rare occasions, bugs happen, like npcs seemingly not appearing to items just following you around and not going to your inventory even tho you're not full. Only happened to me twice in my 300+ day run. Just had to restart the game to fix. Not game breaking so not a big deal tbh.

Get zombies early. Go through the effort of unlocking zombie vineyard and zombie winery.

Grind planks at the circular saw for red dots.
Grind polished stone (use chisels) and grave headstones/fences for blue points. Conical flasks is also a good passive source.

notable features:
- [Interweaving NPC Stories] npc has relationship system where some other npc's cannot be advanced when a related questline from another pertinent npc has not been accomplished
- [Tech Tree] involves three currencies of red (crafting), green (nature), and blue (knowledge) and multiple tech trees which give either crafting recipes or passive perks
- [NPC Vendor Upgrade System] more used NPCs have higher tier stuff to sell
- [Automation System] production and moneymaking can be automated to some extent. zombies can be hired from corpses and perform according to the quality of the corpse.
- [Idler Customization] as mentioned earlier, the corpse quality can be edited by putting in and taking out stuff in order to increase the performance of the zombie. this results in them being able to work more efficiently i.e. they farm faster, cut logs faster, mine faster, allowing you to more easily automate the game.
- [Customizable Layout with Responsive Sprites] when building stuff, you are allowed to decide where to build most workbenches and other stuff. the shelves also respond to having more stuff where it displays a fuller shelf for fuller slots. 
- [Alternative Ways to Complete Quests] some quests ask you for items such as a cauldron or golden apple, which have usually 3 ways to obtain: through crafting, grinding the dungeon, or buying from an npc and can be completed with any of them
- [Purely Aesthetic Customizability Options] i can change the colors of my bed and my kitchen, and i can also add lanterns along the roads and stuff. not really useful stuff, but they add flavor to the game.
- [Fast Travel System] a teleport stone can be bought from the barkeep npc for 2 silver to help you get around easier.

iffies:
- [Unmoveable Layout] part of the point of having a customizable layout would be for aesthetic reasons. the game decided if i want to move stuff around, i have to take apart the stuff that is currently there such as a church bench having to be removed first to be replaced with a soft pillowed church bench. although this is iffy, since it may be for realism sake.
- [Money is Difficult to Make] this is intentional, most likely. the 1:100 translation of bronze, silver, and gold serve as a good obstacle and metric for money sinks found within the game. also, items can only be sold only to specific npcs, and each npc has a fixed amount of money in their wallets so as not to allow exploits. some other specified features must truly be unlocked to allow moneymaking, and even so it doesn't feel overpowered. just that the time you pour in increases in price.
- [Fast Travel System Limited Locations] the morgue adjacent to the house is a 15 second walk away, and there are also some areas that aren't reachable by fast travel. <can be solved with travel scrolls adding more places towards travel stone maybe?>

flaws:
- [NPC has increasing prices per marginal item bought] serves as a good money sink, but impractical if you think about it.
- [Some Buggy Interactions] some quest items can be obtained repeatedly BUT are undestroyable and has to be thrown in a specific dungeon exploit in order to be gotten rid of. some interactions with npcs are repetitive and dont make sense, such as the merchant giving his quest item a mission before then one of the options once again allow you to ask where it is even if you already got it. <translates to more playtesting should have been done>
- [Carriable Items Garbage] when you cut down trees or pick on large rocks, they release items that cannot be put in the backpack and instead must be carried one by one, usually to an ore/log deposit area. i wish there were zombies that cleaned them up or something. or alternatively, items that allow you to bag them right away/break them down so you can. i sometimes cut down trees for the sticks which are backpackable but logs also come out (in twos, even, because of the Logger perk!) they are an eyesore",1672628997,1674235971,True,1,0,0.519319236278533936,0,True,False,False

It has bugs. Zombie farms aren't supposed to lose seeds but gold-star-lentil farms do. You're given some items back after quests that you have no use for and cannot destroy. You have to sleep in a bed in order to trigger some events with no clue that is true. There's a lot that works, but you will definitely notice the bugs.

It has poorly thought out mechanics. The zombies become meaningless after 5-10 of them get made. You can only sell some high-level items to certain vendors. And some high tier items you just can't sell at all to anyone according to the wiki. If you unlock a building, to know what supplies are needed to build it, you have to go to the place to build it, then look it up, then go get resources. Instead of just having recipes appear in the book on mouse-over.

It is a chore to finish. The pacing of the quests is abysmal. There's a giant money hurdle to clear and multiple quests are locked behind it. By the time you accomplish it you have basically every research. Then there are ""do 1 thing and wait 1 game week"" quests. And advancing a week takes 5 minutes of sitting around. Tedious.

It is incomplete without DLC. Some of these issues are apparently resolved in the DLC. So they released a game with all these issues, took time to fix some of them. I don't mind DLC. I do mind THIS DLC.

And I paid them money. I was bored and read the reviews and made my choice. It was the wrong choice. Parts of this are alright, and there's some decent jokes along the way. But its a mediocre game that will definitely frustrate you with bad design choices and half-boiled features. If you're like me, you'll wish you had never bothered.

The game has a big tech tree . Keeps the player occupied

Depth of game and character development is a shallow pond. I'm thinking it was intentional as the 6 characters are supposed to be one dimensional.

This game cannot be played without following a wiki or a guide. 

No manual saves. This is an issue as there are scripted points in the game. If you time them poorly you could easily lose a lot of game time progress.

Progress breaking bugs. There was a glitch at the Sanctum where you had to place enough decorations. I wasn't able to place the necessary amount and had to download a mod to allow me to place anywhere. Another common glitch is not being recognized for having completed objectives and not receiving credit.  Such as decorating the church sufficiently and just not getting an option to upgrade it.

This is not a new game, something I didn't know at the time I purchased. Doesn't look like developer is concerned with patching these bugs but has instead released another $30 worth of DLC instead.

I came to this game with low expectations seeing that these are the same devs that made the clusterf*** that is Punch Club. To be honest, i was wrong thinking this would be a bad game... kind of. I see this game often being compared to Stardew Valley and that is an unfair comparison, because Stardew Valley is a good game and Graveyard Keeper is... well... It is fun, in the sense that instant noodles are filling, it does the job.

The positives: (They are actually ""semi-positives"" and they come with a downside, more about each in the negatives.)
1.- You don't have any pressure and there are no time sensitive quests, there's also no seasons or calendar.
2.- There are a BUNCH of stuff you can do, skills you can unlock and materials to collect.
3.- The story is kind of interesting, though, coming back to the Stardew Valley comparison, this story here is 99% linear. The 1% goes to that one singular choice that affects a DLC ending, that's the degree of freedom you get out of the plot.
4.- Customizing your working areas is kind of fun and making an effective production chain is somewhat rewarding.

Negatives:
1.- While there are no time sensitive quests, you will get overloaded with a lot of stuff to do at any given time and while nothing is dated and there are no seasons, important NPCs only appear one day of the week and this can sometimes gate you hard on quests that randomly require the assistance of a certain NPC.
2.- Graveyard Keeper is proof that ""more is less"" with it's itemization. Lots of plot items that are just there for no reason, lots of materials that get outclassed later in the game and a lack of clarity on what some stuff is for, for this, i want you to take a peek at what the Silver Ingot does, a seemingly valuable item that you would think it's for jewelry or decorating, instead it can be used on nothing except being sold. LAME!
3.- Because the story is linear and there is little to no variety in it's progression, you really only need to play the game one time and you won't have a reason to play it again.
4.- When starting out. your Graveyard Keeper will feel slow, gets tired quickly and the day passes fast, this on top of having the pressure to do lots of things at once will weight down on you, unless you make a conscious effort to let it not get to you. This issue lessens as you discover more aspects of the game, but it never truly goes away.
5.- A lot of the quests are very inorganic and are just there to add artificial length to the game things like ""i should speak to X NPC"" for no reason when said NPC appears once a week or ""bring me X number of materials"" like it's an MMO quest or my favorite ""you'll have to wait for a week to see what has changed"".

I could bring other stuff like, bad spelling on a few sentences or how there is a bit of jank in some places, but that would be nitpicking, Also how this game is one of those ""you gotta look everything up in a wiki"" kind of game, but, to be fair, Stardew Valley is like that.

Despite all the flaws, i had fun and while i would get frustrated with the game at times, i would later pick it up again and come back to it to see what's going on, i was curious to see where the story would go, but a story on a game can only get you so far and the at some point i was just trying to get done with it just to satisfy my curiosity.

TL;DR: It's not a bad game, but it's also not a good game. It's just a game. I had fun with it, but there are a lot of issues that will probably turn you off.",1673933467,1673933467,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Grindy as hell, but it's part of the charm. But you get helpers sometime in the mid-game to help with resource collecting and material crafting, which is a bit better than Stardew Valley.

Money is hard to come by, but the moment you set everything up, you'll have so much you'll be using money to solve all the problems you'll be encountering in the late game.

I was able to get the Base game and the 3 DLCs during a sale, so I only paid about 1/3 their total price, so if you are put off by the game's price plus DLCs, just wait for another sale to come by.

As for Achievements, almost all of them can be achieved in due time, with two exceptions that are missable (one is through dialog options, while the other is if you progressed a story quest too far) so do research on them.

Base Game: You find your self in another world where you are suddenly the keeper of the graveyard. You must keep this graveyard, take care of it's church, and fulfill quest for the villagers in your quest to get home.

Breaking Dead: Included in base game. Adds Zombies to do some of your manual labor for you  100% improvement over doing everything manually.

Stranger Sins: Paid DLC. Add more lore to the world and allows you to open a tavern which generates some good money once you get alcohol production up. A worthwhile expansion.

Game of Crones: Paid DLC. You must help a refugee camp survive against the inquisition. You also get to support the donkey's cause and hunt for a vampire. You don't really get much outside of some side quest and some free food once you develop the camp. The camp development mechanics are inherently flawed and artifically time gate progression.

Better Save Soul: Paid DLC. You get to help a new NPC clean his soul of sins. Put Body in soul blender, move soul to meat machine, put the ""healed"" soul into the portal to see a little scene.

It is easy to effectively break your game by using material on the wrong thing.

If you use the the item you are given for free to craft something else your progress is basically impossible.

I gave the game a 2nd chance and did things the way the game wants you do them, but didn't tell you.  I just found my self still getting bored with all the walking.  To make the situation worse some things can only be done on specific days and you can't just sleep through days.  

After wasting a ton of time walking around to find out I would have to go home and walk back another time, I just can't with this game.  There are far better farm/crafting games to play.

The days are super short, which I can't help but see as an attempt to make the lack of things to do less obvious. All there is to do is tend to corpses (which don't get delivered very often and have a ""get maximum quality!"" puzzle wich is not really explained at all and gets old pretty fast), collect resources and fish and farm, if you feel like it. Bear in mind that the fishing and farming mechanics are very very superficial and limited, so there's that. You can't enter any buildings beside the tavern and the ones on your land. You also  can't interact with any NPCs unless they're shopkeepers or part of a quest, not even the skull is memorable or present during everyday gameplay.

Would not recommend getting this game unless it's hugely discounted, as is (to me) just one of the many hollow survival/farming games that have been churned out in the last years. I got bored well before the 10hrs, with my playtime atm being the absolute maximum I could bear playing this.

Started playing 3 days ago, I already have 27h on it, I havent seen the sun in 3 days, grinding going hard fr.

On similar games like Stardew Valley, I always struggle to play more than 30 days but the fact that Graveyard Keeper gets rid of the seasons and strict ""go back to bed before midnight or else"" day mechanic makes it pretty fluid and addictive to me. So what happens is I grind ; I run out of stamina ; I sleep ; and before you know it, it's already 6AM irl. Right now, I'm on day 183.

Also love it how every NPC quest leads to another NPC leading you to another one again etc. It keeps the storyline fresh and you never run out of things to do. If you're stuck with say the Bishop or are just bored of taking care of the graveyard (yknow, not like that was the whole title), you can instead go burn corpses to collect skulls. Or if you're bored of doing anything involving corpses, just go harvest some crops. And whatever you do, it still benefits the many quests you have.

The creators did a great job making the tasks and resources chain together, sort of like Civilization, where you're constantly engaged, and thinking of what you're going to do next, and planning things out. The sound effects are also quite satisfying, and there is a limited automation system, so you can stop doing some of the basic tasks.

However, a few bad mistakes completely ruin the pacing of the game.

Firstly, every new resource you can produce is locked behind multiple barriers, and you don't know about them until you've spent resources unlocking some of the barriers. This means the game is MUCH better if you're looking at the wiki, and know about all of the barriers up front.

An example is, you spend precious resources to unlock the ""Steel Sword"", but when you actual go craft it, it says you needed the ""steel part"", so you've basically wasted your points, until you also unlock the ""steel part""

Secondly, the resources and pacing for the main plot/questline is pretty bad. The game has several parallel questlines that intersect, and each questline requires certain times in a week to progress, or require progress in other questlines. So you're either waiting, or suddenly scrambling to produce a difficult item before a deadline. If you're constantly producing stuff, at the end of the game, you'll have loads of unused junk in the pipeline, that is essentially wasted effort.

Finally, to end the game, you need a rare variation of an item that is spawned and at a rather slow fixed rate. You cannot craft the item, or speed up the rate, or buy the item. If you're unlucky, you can be waiting weeks just for that one item to finish the game.

I can see this game being an interesting speedrun game, or some people playing the game again and again, but I cannot recommend this game to most people over other similar games.

FULL DISCLOSURE: I have modified the game to my liking by using a few mods available on Nexus. I have a mod that allows me to save at any point in the game rather than have to go to bed or lose progress just because I have IRL interruptions. The other mod extends the length of the day. I like to take my time and explore the world and do activities, the base day length just goes by too quickly for how I like to play.

While it works as a clone of Stardew Valley, just with a dark-comedy overlay, there are definite issues that you'll have to plod through. The missions feel like chores, with never-ending fetch quests beyond which are locked parts of the tech tree or other advancements, not to mention a really minimal journal to keep track of what you're supposed to do for each of the many overlapping quests. 

The energy system is particularly limiting, so you'll have to either get really into food or walk back to the cabin to sleep as little as every few seconds (for the more strenuous activities). Speaking of, walking back and forth to town or to your outposts or to anywhere is quite annoyingly long. Since you're sleeping all the time, get used to a regular and lengthy commute. 

There's the other issue that the game doesn't say how to do things like craft ink or even split a log, so for each and every activity you just have to hope that you'll stumble upon the answer eventually, or just learn through trial and error what you're meant to do. Be prepared to get really familiar with the wiki, especially when the alchemy bench opens up.

How at time I get distracted cause my scatterbrain thinking cause I get focus on building lots of things, or going threw the Dungeon that I forget that I have to see someone or do something on specific day and now have to wait for a full week just gets on to continue that quest line gets on my nerves, not helping how slow you move without speed potion or the teleport stone and needing to do so much with days that feels that they go by so fast, only way I got threw most of it is using a shit ton of zombies to get me all the resources I need it . I have recently gotten the DLC and I did like what they added on paper (like the souls of the bodies I bury or burn doing my work for me at first but it became a chore that wasn't worth it and the ending of that dlc was so anticlimactic that i feel I'll give them finish  or having my on Tavern that made lots of cash but how slow wine and beer took me to make it was just a waiting game that was anticlimactic that i feel I'll give them finish . I can 100% see why the reviews for the DLC are mix to being just more things for me to stress out to very bad and anti-climatic result like helping the refugee camp and getting stuff that I already had or don't need or getting all those dam items for the for the history of the lands was cool at first but became just a pain to get those items that I didn't get them all. I really wish I can enjoy the game but I Just can't anymore it was fun from the start but after all I did it was just a sloge and not worth continuing. 

Is it a bad game I say stay clear of even on sale? no, it was fun for a good amout and I say worth going threw pasts of it
Is it a good game I say to 100% it and get all the dlc? No, it's turns into a grinding fest and it just not worth it.
is it a type of game that you take a break for a good while and come back with a new run? yea, just take a long break if you put the hours that I did cause was so burnt out I looked up the ending. the first ending without DLC was not good if you ask me but it was much better the one with DLC, so much that it made me lose more enjoyment to the game that I had (I will not say more to that, you'll just got to look it up yourself or go threw it.
It was fun for a good while but I don't think I'll be playing it anytime soon, maybe never again. It's not the worst game I play, it's was just too much for some one like me.",1673504315,1673504315,False,3,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False

STEAM DECK REVIEW, IF YOU ARE NOT USING STEAM DECK THIS REVIEW IS USELESS
 --- 
Performance 5/10

The game goes behind 50fps in both linux version and proton version, tried to change a few things but nothing seems to work, because the game animations are sync with the fps, when the game lags it looks really bad.

Cons 

Its one of the few games that for the graphics it has, the game is not as smooth as it could be if the devs would give it some love, and i would like it to improve in the future since its a lot of fun to play in handheld!

Pros

Controls and battery life are good, im missing a lot of good points that the game has only to try to improve its flaws (if either devs or valve can improve the game for SD), so dont expect it to be a unplayable game with the worst gameplay, just performance and save files are the things that are bad.

1.) My biggest complaint is with the game's technology progression wasting the player's time; for example, 'Cultist' is pretty much one of the very last perks you unlock and it's arguably the most useful for knowing which bodies and body parts are good or bad.  This perk allows you to construct higher quality graves and more efficient zombies....but it takes you all the way until the end of the game to capitalize on this...by which point it's the least helpful to your progression.  The game wastes a ton of your time needlessly.  You bury a bunch of bodies only to learn later that 12+ bodies are possible, and if you have the right DLC, even higher quality bodies are possible.  This wouldn't be such a problem if exhuming graves wasn't tedious, forcing you to remove all the grave work before you can switch bodies.  The order of the perks could have been arranged better.  

2.) I also wish the construction aspect wasn't so restrictive.  The game limits where you can build and what you can build there.  It would have been nice to have more creative freedom to place things where you want (such as storage chests).  Most of the map is under utilized and leaves much to be desired in the way of base building.

The game starts off great and fresh. The pixel art is great and the concept is fun. The writing is top notch and there are quite a few great quips in there. It is fun to make zombies and develop the graveyard, but it feels like its trying to do too many things at once.

Now to the bad bits and ultimately why I can't recommend this game. 

You will walk. A lot. A lot a lot. Even with the teleport stone, the problem remains. Everything is just too far away and it feels like the game should be played with a speed potion on the entire time. It takes the better part of a day to walk from one end of the map to the other, and if you are timebound on a task you can forget getting it done that week.

Echoing a lot of other reviews, many of the quests are locked behind other quests, and the npc page doesn't do a good enough job consolidating what you need to know. Speaking of, the lack of a recipe book to keep track of what you need for things feels dated. I had to go with pen and paper to remember all the quests and ingredients I needed to get things done.

Finally, the most negative thing about this game is the amount of waiting you have to do. You can't quickly sleep like in other games, or just set a wait timer like in others. You have to build a specific place and then go there every time you want to wait. Meeting someone at night? Don't have anything meaningful to do in the time between? Are they on the other side of the map from your house (you bet!). There should be an item like the teleport stone to move you through time faster. By the time I had everything automated, there wasn't much to do but wait. 

If you have plenty of time and are patient, I would recommend this game. Otherwise, I would say there are other games that give you that 'feeling of full' for your time better than this one.",1673318151,1673318151,False,127,9,0.795971035957336426,2,True,False,False

The game main issue is how it doesn't explain very well how to obtain certain items, recipes and all that stuff, you have to do a research or have the wiki open if you want to advance fast in this game, but that defeats the point of the game since there is 0 penalty for taking your time, just that your progress will slow down, over the years the game got a few dlc and updates that made the game more enjoyable to play.

The only advise I will give is this, unlock alchemist, help the witch in the swamp and learn how to craft ACCELARATION POTION!! you will go 2 or 3 times faster, which does improve the whole experience by a lot and they aren't hard to make.

If you tired of managing everything you can make Zombies to work for you but you have to check a guide on how to make the best zombies or if you don't care about waiting a bit longer just make a perfect corpse with 18% efficency (Max I seen is 65%) and put it to work, the transportation zombies are great because you can use any zombie efficiency doesn't improve the travel speed so don't get rid of trash zombies instead use them to deliver materials.

At first, I could see the similarities: you have your own land where you do some regular tasks (farming vs gravedigging) and then you have various side quests from the ""townies"" or in this case, villagers. I went and watched some early gameplay and read some in depth reviews since I knew some people hated how there were sparse tutorials and how grindy it became. Eventually I caved and got it during the New Year's sale where the base game, all DLCs, and soundtrack were on sale. Been playing for a week and I am thoroughly obsessed at the moment.

What I love about the tasks/quests in this game is that there are no time limits. If I want, I can be as slow as I want and only focus on my church and graveyard, upgrading my tools, and gardening without ever really worrying about the quests unless I absolutely have to. Or I could do the bare minimum and try to complete all the tasks as fast as possible either by buying items and making them myself. The DLCs at first kind of bombarded me since they're all available at once, so it may have been better to start vanilla, but I think this is for the better as it gave me more tasks to bounce around if I got bored. 

The grind of this game is something I can agree as being the dealbreaker for some people. There appears to simply be no efficient way to collect wood other than bringing it yourself unlike the smithing supplies (or as far as I have researched). Not a big deal since I enjoy the grind so far but I can see how that can become tedious.

This game and all its DLCs was definitely worth the ~$20 price tag from the bundle; I probably would have bought it full price if I had known about it earlier. I appreciate the game has an ending (haven't gotten there quite yet) so I know I'll consider it a good challenge to make a new save and optimize my gameplay later. 

The fact that there are so many tasks open at any time because many quests are dependent on each other is a great challenge for me. I would enjoy some sort of list function but I've been going pen and paper and it makes me feel like I'm being extra productive  after a repetitive day at work. I usually play after I get home from work and I'd definitely say this game helps me recenter and focus.

Not the game play, but the feel, environments and sounds/music.  Nice charm to this.  At times, I do feel overwhelmed with tasks as my OCD behaviour keeps bouncing from one thing to the next and then I forget what I really wanted to do after doing 4-5 other tasks.  You're on a 6 days/week calendar and you can only visit certain characters on particular days, so if you wanted to see someone for a particular task and you missed the day, you'll have to wait for that day to come back.  It's not a terrible thing, because there is plenty to do in the meantime, but can be annoying.
I do find the walking a bit slow and annoying at times.  Maybe this is something I'll get later in the game, but a horse/cart travelling would be a nice addition.  Luckily, the map is not huge.  It's a bit difficult at times understanding what items do or where to get them.  A lot of trial and error.

Pros:
-Good graphics
-Nice music
-Fun gameplay
-Interesting plot
-Interesting concept
-Good atmosphere
Con (Please notice that I didn't write cons, I wrote con, single con): The only con is the grind. I liks grind but this is designed badly. 
Example A: You need item A. To craft it you need the technologu B. To learn it you need the blue experience points. To learn them you need to craft stuff that gives blue exp. To craft you need faith points. You can earn them once a week and it you earn 3 at a time at the start. You need like at least 100. You need to wait a week which takes at least 30 minutes irl.
Example B: There are 6 days a week and 6 important NPCs. You can talk with each of them 1 day a week. You have to wait a lot irl time and it is not fun or interactive. You just have to wait. No time skip.
Example C: You have to wait while sleeping but at least time moves faster.
Example D: Donkey who brings corpses goes on a strike and demands carrot and oil. I had both of them but for some reason I had to wait few days for his return. Also he decided to not work for one day a week. Why do I have to wait? It is funny but gets boring.
Exampls E: You have to do stuff at the top left of the map and bring it to bottom right. If you forget, go back again. Repeat all the time. Half the gameplay is spent on waiting or walking, not even grinding. There is a teleport stone but it has a cooldown. Why? This is not a multiplayer game?

At first, the sheer breadth of technology to pursue clashed with the conspicuous lack of hand-holding, but it wasn't long before I found the trial-and-error discovery to be its own form of entertainment. Graveyard Keeper's greatest achievement is in the relative laxity of its tempo. You are mostly free to explore and expand in a manner and at a pace most befitting to you. The six-day work cycle moves swiftly, but the lack of seasons and errand timers means you can float through your tasks without stressing over a missed character meeting or temperature-specific crop yield. 

In short, I appreciate the hyper-focused goal of PROGRESSION in a sandbox without too many limitations. Indeed, even the ample fetch quests are put in place to keep progression progressing and story beats beating.

To this end, I hold M&M duels. Taking two candies between my thumb and forefinger, I apply pressure, squeezing them together until one of them cracks and splinters. That is the “loser,” and I eat the inferior one immediately. The winner gets to go another round. I have found that, in general, the brown and red M&Ms are tougher, and the newer blue ones are genetically inferior. I have hypothesized that the blue M&Ms as a race cannot survive long in the intense theater of competition that is the modern candy and snack-food world. Occasionally I will get a mutation, a candy that is misshapen, or pointier, or flatter than the rest. Almost invariably this proves to be a weakness, but on very rare occasions it gives the candy extra strength. In this way, the species continues to adapt to its environment. When I reach the end of the pack, I am left with one M&M, the strongest of the herd. Since it would make no sense to eat this one as well, I pack it neatly in an envelope and send it to M&M Mars, “Please use this M&M for breeding purposes.” This week they wrote back to thank me, and sent me a coupon for a free 1/2 pound bag of plain M&Ms. I consider this “grant money.” I have set aside the weekend for a grand tournament.

The problem I have is that this game, on surface level, tries to make itself seem like a Stardew Valley clone with dark elements, but it is far, far from that.

I do have a couple of pros..
+ unique gameplay
+ art and music are good

but the cons outweigh the pros very greatly at this point in time..
- lack of freedom
- no character customization
- spend most of the game walking from point A to point B but takes forever to do so which wouldnt be an issue if the days weren't so short
- leveling stuff feels like a chore rather than a reward
- ""wild goose chase"" type game play
- takes forever to unlock seemingly basic things
- no quest log that is easy to refer to despite there being so many quests at all times
- no map to refer to
- days are very short so you often find yourself completely forgoing sleep just to get a few things done
- have to go thru piles of story at the beginning that will be completely irrelevant to you until much later in the game

This game is nothing like Stardew Valley so you should definitely consider that if you were thinking about buying this, hoping that it would be a macabre game similar to Stardew Valley. It has almost nothing in common with that game whatsoever.

I might edit this opinion later but I doubt that's going to happen as the problems I have seem to be core parts of the gameplay.",1672862978,1672862978,False,2,1,0.497942358255386353,0,True,False,False

The game mechanic are simular to Stardew Valley in which you have day & night cycles & you have energy which goes down when doing tasks & gathering. Your energy can be gained back by eating/drinking and sleeping. Also each day has a set time e.g. certain NPC will only come on certain days so you do need to plan around that when doing quests for certain NPCS.
The dialog is funny & the characters all seem to have there own personality.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

I picked up the game again in 2022 after seeing a image of zombies in the game that does the woodcutting/farming/mining, you know the manual labor that I started to resent in the mid game from before. This CHANGED everything for playing. It was just a consent moment forward in progression. I completely forgot about the whole 12 gold needed and when I got that quest I was already at 9 gold and due to my zombie farm up and running I new I'd have it in no time. Decided while waiting to finish up the main story line and with the wiki having all the info now it made creating 12 white skull corpses more fun and I decided, while waiting for the gold, to only have those in my graveyard this time.

Firstly i dislike the majority of the characters to be honest, almost everyone in this game immediately takes advantage of you or just seemingly gets in your way on purpose to get things from you. and you cant say no because you need them to progress and to my knowledge you cant get around it. its irritating because the dialog is pretty funny too but i just end up skipping past it because i just dislike the characters or find them annoying.

And secondly the days are really short. which in and of itself isn't a big of a deal but interacting with things is finicky in this game i often press the button to craft on a bench, gather plants, or store or mine resources and it my guy will just stand there or throw the thing im holding. i'm in range but it wont work all the time. i can interact with something the same way a few times and it doesnt always work. this waste of time adds up noticeably on these very short days. i cant count the number of days I've missed the chance to talk to a npc that is only there on that day by 30 seconds or a minute or two. its frustrating to have to wait a whole fucking week to interact with the npc's because i juuuust missed them because the finicky interaction delayed the work i need to do for them that day.

Meanwhile all I wanted was for me to expand upon my farm and grow vegetables, until the donkey spoke to me that he was protesting until I get him more carrots and I oil his cart and that he would stop delivering those dumb dead bodies until his demands are met, my pupils widened and to this day I didnt give him the oil. I literally got a pause from an incessant and annoying system that delivered me constant corpses that I would toss the most of in the river and all because a donkey decided to unionize and demand more power to the proletariat.

THE GOOD:
This is a great chill game with so much to offer, so many things to do; to find, to craft, to understand.

The world and everything in it has an eerie, dream-like quality in how it is presented. The art style is beautifully maintained and the music sets the calm yet ever-so-slightly deranged mood perfectly.

The gameplay is simple on the surface, but the tech trees and quest lines add just enough complexity to incentivize planning out your actions without penalising you for just mucking about picking flowers when you find them.

I don't want to spoil anything, but just exploring and trying things out when they present themselves before directly following the quest lines definitely helps with finding your ""Keeper Legs"".

THE MIDDLING:
To be fair, there is a learning curve. But the payoff for figuring things out without resorting to having a wiki open as you play is infinitely satisfying.

Also, this game is missing some modern quality of life features present in just about every other similar game. BUT! In a video game era polarised between ""instant gratification"" or ""get gud or die"" games, Graveyard Keeper sits nicely between the two. 

THE BAD?:
If you're squeamish, be aware this game is full of: desecration of the dead, cannibalism, persecution based on religion, classism, lack of female characters, and whatever the heck Dig is.

TLDR; Anyone who complains about the grind in this game has no patience or ability to to appreciate working towards a goal. Yes it's grindy, but in the good way where you feel how each accomplishment adds to your progress.",1672507805,1672507805,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Update after playing through the game and all DLC's currently available: so, here goes.  I still really enjoyed this game and I do recommend it, however it has some issues.  The characters are never really fully developed, neither is the plot, and at the end of everything currently available, I still have no idea ""why"" (in internal game plot language) any of this happened.  Now, that is actually part of the fun of this game.  You can just laugh at it, it's not too serious, and I found myself chuckling a lot at ""plot points"" that other games might have taken seriously - but in this game you just can't.  It made me laugh.

However, I do think there's a structural error here in the overall game play: it made you take a *few* things seriously in order to advance the game plot, and you have no indication ahead of time what those are or why, all of a sudden, you have to pay attention to the choices you are making.  The brilliance of this game was that you didn't have to really take anything seriously, the plot just marched on - until it didn't and then you are like ""wait, I just played all this time in casual mode and now I find out that something I did shuts out some whole part of the game?  oh, not cool...""  The game would have been better if it never made you care about your choices for real, and just kept letting you generally slack off.

That said, its weird, its fun...  it's just also unfinished and a bit schizophrenic. 

I would love to play more of this, and hope that the developers will continue to produce new content.  There's a *lot* of room for new content here, and there's a *lot* of room to correct some of the issues with the game.  I hope that happens.",1665431009,1672461494,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1 - The grind is absolutely, horrifyingly punishing. Most reviews mention ""grindy"", so I went in expecting big-numbers grind (mine 400 whatever to levelup, etc). I could be fine with that. What I am *not* accepting of is having to spend 30s to go anywhere, 20s of any activity draining my entire energy bar, having to spend 30s to go back to bed .. And another 10s watching my character sleep. 
This is not a ""sometimes"", this what happens during most of the playtime. Further compounded by

2 - The game's design is actively, pettily, disrespecting the value of your time. Movement is slow, back-and-forth are ludicrously omnipresent (low inventory, spread out storage options, spread out crafting areas, ...). 
To put things in perspective, I ended up modding the game more and more, up to :
* constant double movespeed (at  no cost)
* energy draining at half the normal rate
* increased inventory sizes, both chests and character
I still got fed up enough to then write this review.

Last (and least) offense, the accessibility is ROUGH, especially for a game that begs to be compared to Stardew Valley. It has much more depth, and arguably better writing (albeit nowhere near the same relationship-thingy, we're only talking about short quips here), but it's closer to Terraria in terms of needing a wiki to understand wtf is going on.

The real shame is that it's not a bad game. It's a pretty, deep, humorous, no-fail sandbox with a ton of progression to be made. It feels like a very good game was handed to someone in charge of final balancing, and he somehow decided to take his revenge on the world for the kid that bullied him 20 years ago. The fundations are solid, but it's all behind a thin yet omnipresent layer of insufferable grind. 

As shipped, i'd rate it 4/10, and strongly advise against buying it.

It somewhat delivers on that. It's got interesting characters and I was definitely interested in the story hooks that I had encountered, but it's particularly frustrating to play for one big reason.

You've got to walk everywhere, you don't walk particularly fast, and you either need to pretty deftly manage your inventory full of lots of intermediary products or you'll be backtracking multiple times to collect the resources you need to unlock a shortcut or build a building away from your house. I found myself multiple times rolling my eyes and sighing when I saw another shortcut I needed to unlock because it meant another 2 minutes of walking back to the base, which carried with it the chance to be distracted by one of many other tasks I was mentally juggling. 

This is compounded by the in-game calendar - certain tasks can only be done on certain days of the week, and the same goes for NPC quest-givers who only visit on certain days. If you were planning to complete a quest from an NPC but you missed your window, too bad, you've got to wait for another ~30 minutes for them to be back this time next week.

My issues with the game mostly have to do with the mental load that the game seems to require of you in order to do things ""efficiently"" - at a certain point, I had enough with the stack of things that I wanted to get done and the backtracking and walking it required to get there. It's possible that these issues lessen the further you progress - and if that's the case, it didn't quite hook me quickly enough. 

If you've got more patience than me or if you don't get so caught up trying to do everything all at once, then this one would probably be a good game for you.

TL;DR: Mid game with some Major bugs, Stardew Valley this ain't.

Well is not bad if you wanted to know that, is entraining enough, but not fun, and there are some really major and prevalent glitches that will and do ruin the experience, there will be no more developer support and any modder side patches are not likely, is a smallish game. The most annoying one is the shops being frozen in the state they where left in before you get the church, so you better make your money and stock in important items such as whetstones and blue point books before that, because they restock items only before that, after that they do not, also, don't wait to much before doing so, there is what appears to be a memory leak if you wait more than 6 weeks, if you are ok with all of the above and are in the mood for making a million fetch quests you may enjoy this.

If you are curious about the main system, the whole graveyard + corpse thing, is complex and requires a lot of steps, it becomes somewhat interesting by the end of the game, the worst part: it is shallow with clear ""correct answers""and a lack of customization potential, in the end you'll want a full marble graveyard with perfect corpses buried in it, a perfect zombie army a maxed refugee camp and a maxed tavern, I was starting to have faith that the game would be better with the next DLC, but it never came, the game is dead and the modders seem like they have other objectives at the moment, all and all i would not recommend it and only make an exception if you are really bored and spending 100+ hours being frustrated sounds like fun to you.

The game in its base state can be tedious, little to do but follow the story and finish the game, and without a lot of side grinding you won't have a ton of resources or cash by the end.  Its playable, kind of a grind, but fun.

With all its current expacs, its almost too easy.  Participating in the expansions rapidly fills your coffers with cash and prizes, many of which can be used to advance the game without utilizing the whole of your own crafting toolset.  

On yet another hand the game's true ""winning"" ending requires at least Stranger Sins and Game of Crones, kind of a dick move.  

Better Save Soul is a huge grind, without a payoff beyond being able to harvest and upgrade autopsy parts, and a certain amount of additional automation.  The storyline fizzled  out so suddenly, I went online to find out where to go, only to find out that was it, no closure, expac done.

I find myself with mixed feelings.  I love what this game is at its base, but some of the things it does to get there, and the incomplete state without the first two expansions make it VERY difficult to not see this as a cash grab, selling parts of the game that feel like they should have been in the base game.

I still love this game, and don't regret any of my 180 hours playtime in it, but I hesitated a long time over the ""do you recommend this game"" buttons.


Oh, one tip for the beginner, don't throw any corpses in the river, make a pile somewhere out of the way until you have the tech to burn them, you need all the ash you can get.",1672064937,1672064937,True,86,0,0.88326561450958252,0,True,False,False

The premise is simple: You are isekai-d to another world, told you're the new gravekeeper, and told to figure out how to survive. You have a 7-day week where different events and people do different things. The art style is 8-bit, almost Final Fantasy Tactics-esque, and the gameplay in the beginning is very enjoyable, BUT after 20 hours over two different gameplay attempts, I can safely put this one in the bin. 

First, the characters in this game felt relatively unremarkable and unnecessary (looking at you particularly, communist comic-relief donkey). They were a help only minimally, and more often than not were just day-specific quest givers and money/item/mcguffin dumps. There was no need or incentive to interact with them outside of that and their personalities felt very shallow beyond their job titles: bishop to gain followers, merchant to make money, helpful tavern owner. Obviously, all games have this but I actually felt that I was obligated to doing them to advance instead of freely interacting and being rewarded for learning about them since there was nothing to learn outside of their quest requirements.

Second, the crafting. It was okay, but as somebody else pointed out, you have to memorize every recipe, and that kinda sucks. The crafting automatically uses nearby materials from trunks, which is a nice QoL touch, but at one point I went to 3 different machines to make 1 thing to make moving between different sections of the mortuary/basement more bearable. 

Thirdly, this game gives very little guidance, which can be fun for some. I love a good MetroidVania, don't get me wrong. But a MetroidVania this is not. It does have a dungeon you can unlock further on (never got that far), but your donkey going on strike until you give him carrots and seed oil when you have no idea how to get either is very frustrating. Tbh I quit when I had to look for how to find stone deposits because I'd been knee deep in the fan wiki for this game for half of my playthrough.

Lastly, and my biggest gripe, the movement on foot (which is all I accessed) feels really slow. It's the 8 direction akin to other games of the genre, but I felt like my feet were dragging through mud. The most important item in my playthrough was the item that let me skip walking and what little walking I did before and after felt like a chore. Stardew has interesting things to do or look at on the way to any given destination, and this one is holding a button until you arrived at your destination. You're not really rewarded with exploring, because what you often found was a new npc in a (sometimes literal) forest.

While this game is tagged as having frequent violence and gore, I personally didn't find the game to be all that gorey. The most you get in that front is corpses, skeletons, and the occasional blood splatter, and the graphics aren't realistic enough for those to bother me.

went into this game being told it's a medieval version of stardew valley, and i was not let down! the gameplay is fun, music is relaxing, NPC's are all unique. the game definitely doesn't hold your hand in the aspect of telling you *exactly* what to do, giving you the freedom to make discoveries at your own pace and based on how you'd like to play the game.

there are things i probably should have figured out in the first few hours, but based on how i chose to approach the game, i discovered them much later. making the discovery and realization of, ""ah! that's what i've been missing!"" keeps the game fresh. 

if you're someone that's not the biggest fan of pixel art, compared to Stardew Valley, the pixel graphics are much smoother in my opinion and less clunky in aesthetic. (thought i do love SV's pixel art)

Graveyard Keeper is not ""Stardew Valley in a cemetary"". Yes, you can grow a garden but that's where the similarities end. In Stardew, your goal is to farm and everything you do in this game, from growing crops, to crafting items, to talking to villagers and more, is done so that the game can reward you with more ways to farm. There are multiple ""end goals"" (fixing the community center, reaching a grandpa score within three years, etc) but they're all there as sort of ""tutorials"" in how to play. The real fun is designing and growing things.

In Keeper, the end goal is getting the NPCs to fully appreciate you so that you can obtain items to leave the game's world. Every action committed only serves to further NPC ""like"" meters so that new quests trigger. Those quests are interconnected (levelling up your likes with the Village Dancer might trigger a quest that has you interact with the Astrologer and so on) and they always require a ""currency"" of sorts. That currency might be crops farmed, cemetery maintenance, food created, etc. Each NPC can also only be met on certain days and the calendar rotates between said NPC/days. So the game is more about time management than it is a farm sim.

You quickly realize that outside of possibly Alchemy, everything you commit to only has one use, and that use is only for one, maybe two NPC interactions. Once those interactions are accomplished, it becomes obvious that the only reason to continue with these actions is to increase your wealth, which is needed to unlock a form of ""civilian status"" gating, which when unlocked offers more opportunities to access NPC quests and new mechanics. It means that you'll grow wine once for one person, then it's up to you if you want to continue or not but there's no in-game reason to do so other than accelerate how fast the game will end.

The economy is quite bizarre: most people selling you items won't buy the same items back. If people sell a particular quality tier of an item, it's likely they won't buy other quality tiers of the same item. Most vendors will not buy anything you have to sell except for 1-2 specific items. Repeated purchases raise the price of the items they sell, and repeated selling of an item will lower its base cost for days (maybe weeks). This bottlenecks how fast you can sell items you create, slowing down progression. In a game where storage is something you have limited access to (there are designated spaces for you to build on, and you have to choose where you build additional storage or the next new crafting station), it can mean that even though you want to continue growing grapes or harvesting honey, you'll reach a point where you end up with a ridiculous amount of items you can't do anything with.

Days go by extremely fast, and energy depletes even faster, so every action counts, at least until you unlock potent energy replenishers but even then the game has a mechanic that punishes you for staying up too long by draining your energy constantly after two days. The game also doesn't tell you that there's a fast travel feature you can purchase in-game, so your first days are likely going to be spent mostly walking around. Be warned.

Finally, there's a tone here that may not appeal to everyone. The game, from the very start, makes it very clear that it's not for the squeamish. You get to extract and manipulate body organs in twisted ways, which involves pretty much everything you've read from Ed Gein and others like him. It's meant to be dark, with dark humour and it certainly is that. Cooking ""mystery meat"" ""burgers"" to feed priests watching a witch burning is certainly something.

Why then, am I recommending this game? Well, the core loop of cemetery management is quite entertaining. From obtaining bodies to preparing them, to organising the cemetery and its decorations... it's quite unique. It's also a game that is teaching me not to be a min-max player. I used to play Stardew Valley with a spreadsheet and a calculator. I was running it like I was an accountant. Keeper lets you know right away that you will not have the time or energy to do everything you can at the same time. It also further discourages you from attempting to do everything by making sure all its mechanics aren't game-breaking and they actually serve distinct, unique functions. It's forcing me to adapt the way I play these sims and I appreciate that. If I want to do cemetery management, I have to stop worrying about everything else and just focus on that. If I want to grow the best crops, I have to forget about everything else and just focus on gardening.

The game further pushes this mindset by introducing no real deadlines to anything, and by including an automatic maintenance system for most of its mechanics through the creation of zombies. Graveyard Keeper tells you that it's okay to not multi-task, it's ok to do the thing you want to do right now and forget about the rest; you'll meet whatever NPC again when you want to focus on THAT.

I couldn't resist at the sale price so I started it back up again from scratch and this time, I found it to be more interesting and for whatever reason (I don't know if they added more in the way of a tutorial or if I just had more patience and was a bit more open to it) I found it a lot easier to get going.

Let me get straight to the point. [i]Graveyard Keeper[/i] is not a farming simulation game. Of course, it has farming, but farming is not the central focus of the title. The story begins with a bit of an existential conundrum: our beautifully-bearded main character finds himself alone in the dark. An equally dark figure informs him that he is now a graveyard keeper. He now needs to figure out on his own how to get home. 

The focus of the game is of course, taking care of a graveyard and managing the adjacent church. Daily tasks in [i]Graveyard Keeper[/i] range from the familiar cutting trees and mining ores, to writing new sermons to perform in the church, to disemboweling and studying corpses. [b]Yes, you are expected to be jack-of-too-many-trades.[/b] Each task requires energy, which can be regained by sleeping, though running out of energy has no consequences and you’re free to stay awake for days if you want. Progression is driven by unlocking crafting recipes in several technology trees for each of the main vocational skills in the game, allowing you to build crafting stations like a carpenter’s workbench and anvil, but also embalming tables and alchemy racks.

Unlike [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley/]Stardew Valley[/url] in which any profession can potentially carry you through the game, but [i]Graveyard Keeper[/i] demands that you give equal attention to each of the many disciplines as failing to progress one will likely block you from pursuing others effectively. 

Visual graphic wise, the sprites details are very bewitching. Each of them gives a unique vibe as well. For example: The town is not just a bunch of same-looking houses, but it feels alive, reflecting the activities of its inhabitants. Although it may not be very noticeable, several NPCs do have some small animations that depict the current situation they are facing. That little animation details, personally blow me away as it is very considerate of the animation designers to make them feel even more alive. 

In the aspect of storytelling, well I would suggest you not to compare it with [i]Stardew Valley[/i] but I personally do enjoy the dark humors and the story plots from the DLCs especially [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1430990/Graveyard_Keeper__Game_Of_Crone/]Game of Crone[/url].

Overall, there is a lot to enjoy about [i]Graveyard Keeper[/i] despite it can be quite grindy. If you are not a fan of crafting or grinding games, I personally would not recommend this title. However, if you are looking for a complicated yet still somehow easy-going game that allow you to spend countless of hours without realizing, then [i]Graveyard Keeper[/i] is a fantastic choice. It consumed my soul, the same way as I forced my keeper to consume the flesh he harvested from the dead 💀",1651429636,1671077590,True,24,0,0.75761646032333374,0,True,False,False

It has some funny characters and a lot of sarcasm. Nevertheless, I'll elaborate below why I'm not giving it a positive review.

The first thing I noticed is that  tasks become repetitive and mechanical pretty much quickly. This is a normal part of this game, due to its completion's nature. Maybe, I got used to more talkative or interactive NPCs, since in this case you need to complete X task to continue talking to characters, to get more from the storyline. 

I also found myself frustrated somehow, due to the vast amount of objects that needed repair, since some areas are locked, and you need to wait a good amount of time to get more research technologies, to proceed to other areas, or obtain new materials. While I'm patient with this kind of game, normally, I found myself desperate for some ""routine change "" at some point. Exploration is kind of limited at first, and it takes you a fair amount of time to get out of town.

This game comes with a tutorial stage, which helps give your first baby steps on this graveyard universe, but some mechanics could be better explained, such as the ones for research inside the church. Also, the calendar system is a bit confusing sometimes, and you're left on your own to figure out farming, fishing and most of the crafting items you'll need to fix the wrecked place.

There's a lack of fun side quests. There are actually quests for many NPCs, but they aren't so rewarding or rewarding at all. They feel more like an obligation, instead of having fun. Usually, energy drains pretty much quickly, and days are ridiculously short, even if you don't die or faint, at night. This is due to the amount of energy you consume crafting and the time it takes you to commute from your graveyard to town, or to other areas. 

Overall, the game makes you feel like a zombie slave, with occasional sarcastical interactions with the gloomy town populace, and that's it.  
I can't recommend it thoroughly, since I didn't feel I was playing something relaxing, and to make it worse I expected much more action from this title, so that added negatively to my disappointment. Get it on a sale, but not the full price. Not worth it.",1670692829,1670766276,False,3,0,0.547325074672698975,0,True,False,False

Management RPG with a spooky theme and an expansive crafting tree. it is amazing that I was as determined as I was to finish this game, but in my defense I was having a great time for the first hundred hours, while the game still felt like it had things to discover. 

Pros: uuuh... i guess i was engaged enough to play.... this long. but for all the hours i have in this game so far, i feel like i didn't actually get much done.

*SPOILERS AHEAD*
Cons: 
-Bad pacing. Really, really bad pacing.  Within the first hour of gameplay, you get the quest to obtain the royal stamp, among other quests. It takes *so* much effort to get that stamp, for absolutely no payoff. this is just one of many examples of how this game has weird gating requirements, where you don't really accomplish much besides... waste your time.

-Slow. - speaking of wasting time, aside from the bad pacing, animation speed, work speed, Hell, even *WALK* speed is unbearably slow. there's a potion you can buy from clotho that makes your walking speed less agonizing, which is... something.  by the end of my playtime i was actively on my phone because i had everything i needed for the quests, but every step of the tasks needed to happen in a separate week, so i was just passing time by meditating... which was not fun.

-Grind. separate from the slow content, and bad pacing - everything is a grind. even if the quests could be accomplished in a reasonable timeframe, and even if the animations were faster, the actual gameplay is just so grindy. it's like they coded a limited amount of things, so in order to artificially pad your gameplay time, they decided to multiply all of the numbers by a magnitude of 5. you need more crops than you should. more money than you should. research takes a numbing amount of points. 

-Everything is glitchy. If there's a way to equip things to those 4 squares at the bottom of the screen, i didn't manage to make that happen in 200 hours of gamplay, and i really really looked for it. all of the menus are not standard, and crafting is absolutely painful- why can't i queue more than one grape pie at the furnace, when i can do more than one process in the stone crafter? why is that feature just not repeated on literally every single interface? 


nothing in this game feels worth it after all is said and done. This is a bit of a dramatic statement to make about a *video game* of all things, but if you compare this game to similar games experiences, they leave you either feeling some sense of accomplishment or maybe even an emotional message. what is the graveyard even for besides the priest's quests? nothing. it doesn't even look good. research, zombies, crops, crafting... all it does is help advance the quests, and once you are done with the quests, do you want to go back and do anything? personally, not even a little bit. 

as a final note,  i find it *hilarious* that the donkey at the end of the game quips about greedy DLC when the talking skull talks about content that didn't make it to the game. i'm normally a pretty big supporter of DLC, but after finishing the base game, i don't want anything to do with the dlc. i might even not buy anything from this developer going forward.",1670138333,1670138333,False,1,0,0.496240615844726563,0,True,False,False

The satire is also a nice touch. The game runs smooth after a few hours of learning the ropes. The story is interesting enough. 

It can get tiring and never ending at times but that's where zero time limits really help. You have to really think how to make it through certain scenarios since the game doesn't hand you all the answers. If you have enough patience and are willing to run around and look for things this can be a really fun and relaxing game. 

If mindless back and forth chores bother you then stay far away from this game. It can become mind numbing after a while and you may have to leave many duties unfulfilled. As stated before, the nonexistent time limit really helps you figure out how to accomplish things, all you need is patience.

But thats not to say the plot is forgettable; its great fun and can get pretty deep quickly if you pay attention to the interlocking details.
Get the DLCs for sure though. They really do the game a great service and vastly improve and expand upon the lore.

Plus; who doesn't want hoards of zombies growing cabbages for you?

I really hope more DLC is incoming, as I'd love to see the zombie mechanics expanded. Maybe a plotline for the one guy you don't res yourself? Eager to pay £5 for that guy's deep lore.

I got the game because I saw that it was frequently recommended for people who enjoyed Stardew Valley, so upon first impression, I thought that Graveyard Keeper would be in a similar vein of ""You inherited this plot of land, the goal is to try and restore it to its former glory."" 

And at the most basic level, the game IS about that: you play the titular graveyard keeper, whose progress towards the long-term goal of the game starts with needing to take care of the graveyard and its corresponding church, thus restoring the area. However, there's also a larger, overarching storyline that uses a lot of elements from other parts of the game. For example, a quest might have you bring some food to an NPC, but you also have to buy the recipe for that food, then grow/gather the ingredients, and then actually make the food, but then you might also have to cook that food and wait even longer to get the final product.

Graveyard Keeper definitely isn't a super casual game, since storyline progression is extremely reliant on completing quests. Certain characters are only available on certain days once a week, so if you happen to miss a specific character one week, you have to wait until the next week to find them again, which can get a bit annoying and can make it feel like you're on a time-crunch. The game is, again, quite grindy and I'd say it definitely needs a bit more thinking and strategizing than a more casual game like Stardew Valley might need.

It doesn't even have indicators for which NPCs you can visit each day, which sucks because they only become accessible once a week and you lose a lot of time on quest progression if you miss them. The tech tree is pretty confusing and if you don't take a specific path in accessing technologies, your progression becomes incredibly slow (although to be fair, its slow anyways). You can't put logs or big stone pieces into your inventory and have to carry them one at a time, which gets annoying really quickly and also doesn't make any sense like why would you put that restriction on just those two resources.

Pros: There is PLENTY to do. There are plenty of recipes and tedious things for people that like structured resource based gameplay. There are plenty of characters to interact with and a lot to explore.

Cons: The main con for me is that there is no quest log or journal. The characters menu shows current quests but there is little indication of what to do or where to go. No arrows or anything like that pops up to guide me so I spent too much time walking around trying to find where they were talking about.
There is no ability to run. Perhaps you can unlock something later on but at the beginning the map is far too big to be walking about so slowly.
The level of tedious work, as many have pointed out, is a bit on the extreme. You are a graveyard keeper so a basic task would be to put a cross up on a grave site. Make a cross at a carpenter's bench...but first you need to unlock and build the carpenter's bench which requires another thing...which in turn requires another thing plus all the resources which are manually carried and placed individually somewhere.

The only problem I have for this game is that you play just for the sake of the story and progression.

building has this weird jank where its pretty clear the developers ONLY want you to build certain things in certain places. rather then make your own layout, they put very specific restrictions on where you can build next to your house, garden, and church. id rather just have one big space and let me do things my own way. its something you see in every zone you can build in the game

all the research originally had notes such as ""crafted at distillery"" those were removed in favour of ""crafted at zombi-distillery"". not only does this reveal your going to be making zombies later, but it just adds needless confusion. and this is widespread across the entire game.

Graveyard Keeper has the bones of a solid management game, something to scratch the itch of several different games (.e.g Stardew Valley), but there's some baffling design choices that give it an extremely stilted pacing. Small design choices that would gently guide the player in a certain direction simply aren't made. Heck, even the fan wiki is so simply-stated there's a couple of early-game truths that simply are there for you to find. 

For instance: iron is the first resource the game gatekeeps expecting you to repair a bridge to access a swamp you're told about. I forgot how cheap it was to fix the bridge and farmed experience to level up my construction abilities, because the game doesn't keep a journal of to-do projects you can check at any time. Eventually I build the bridge, harvest iron from the swamp, and then find out what I assumed was a solid ridge line north of my house was in fact a gulch full of iron, clearly put there by the devs to tide over brand new players. I had nothing to push me north, and walking around the puddles of water was a pain, so I simply didn't.

The writing is similarly stilted. The overall plot of the main character being from our world and waking up in a fantasy world as a graveyard keeper feels forced. An isekai for isekai's sake tends to be boring, as I'm playing both a moron and a man with zero moral compass. He runs around a magical fantasy world asking childish ""how do I get home"" questions in situations that signal with every fiber of their being ""You could get in bad situations pissing these people off."" Then you go back to your cottage and cook up human flesh with zero negative consequences. Not even a snarky achievement or implication someone in town would frown upon such behavior. The first real quest the game gives you is to obtain a seal so you can stamp the corpse meat as legit and sell it to the barkeep as not-human. Which is odd given I can gnaw on Old Pap-Pap's thigh meat right in the middle of his pub and nobody bats an eye.

I don't ask for every player character to be logical and intelligent but it's baffling the writers thought it necessary to over-explain the fake you're playing an isekai game but not structure early-game conversations to explain little things, like where an abundance of rock might be or the iron deposit near your house.

It sucks because it's clear the devs know *something* about design. The game makes a huge deal about intentionally throwing roadblocks, literal in lots of cases, and teasing you that the game will become *so much easier* once you clear them. The art for the freaking game teases the fact you get a mount that cuts down on all the freaking time you waste walking early-game, even.

tl;dr Graveyard Keeper is gorgeous, but it stutters to the point it's difficult to find a fun flow-state like most other games of this ilk with day/night cycles and persistent work-weeks. If you know that going in you might have more initial fun than I did.",1667570566,1667570720,False,1,0,0.482014387845993042,0,True,False,False

Also, once you figure out how the economy works in the game it becomes a lot easier. But again no real pressure. And you cant fail! So remember that! One thing to note, some of the quests are connected. So if you get stuck on one, continue another one that you can. It may open up something that helps you with the one you are stuck on. My only thing is that you produce a lot in the game. And there are many items you cant really sell or do anything with. I think the DLC solves for this, but I think they should definitely have a way to sell some of the other stuff you produce or at least increase the selling price for them. *Looking at you wine and beer*",1666933570,1666933570,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Because of the unfortunately complex commerce system, you can craft so many things that have virtually no value. Once you get enough of something to complete a quest you can usually stop producing it since you can't sell extras. I would have appreciated being able to sell all or most of the items (see Stardew valley) so that I can clear out chests and get benefits for all of the grinding. 

Also, this game is a linear story- you MUST do all of the quests for all of the characters in a rather specific order. Some character quests are dependent on others so if you are stuck just do quests for other characters. However, if you are less interested in one facet of the sim (like combat), too bad. 

Honestly, fun to play with but not sure that the end game is worth the grind. I even resorted to save scumming to get higher level books because it was so tedious to grind. Also, there are attributes in the crafting that you cannot get without the DLC. It was strange that the DLC showed up at all in the base game.

If I could sum this game up, I would be to say that the game throws a bunch of quests and a deluge of small tasks your way and you are constantly going off the path of your main task to complete a different task (because you are there). This takes time and inevitably another task that is even more important pops up, which you now have to do and you will have to come back to your main task later. Of course, then you will need to sleep, or will need food, or will need other supplies....and on and on and on. Due to this core game mechanic, I couldn't stop playing and was sucked in!

I did get all of the DLC's and in my opinion they are all worth getting. I would say that the game is done in such a way that you would want to get the DLC's along with the main game so you can enjoy all of their story lines and features, while you play the core game. Adding them in after the core game being completed would be a lot more boring due to the core game loop throwing so many tasks at you at once being a main draw (for me). I found that once I got to the end game and a lot of the ""goals"" were solved that I got a little bored waiting on timed events to progress the game to completion. That said, Stranger SIns was the best, followed by Game of Crone (both great). While Better Save Soul, while decent, is skippable as it adds almost no additional lore and its features are just nice.

If I had any minor complaints it would be that after you have the gold to buy the aristocrat papers, gold no longer is something difficult to come by. Also, after you upgrade the cathedral the 2nd time, the graveyard also larger no longer needs to grow/improve (especially if you have the aristocrat papers). Additionally, some items, once you have them and use them for their one time purpose or in the case of notes, read them....they don't go away and take up space in chests. While there is a way to take them to the dungeon and place them in a book case where they will dissappear, this is wonky and there should be a better way to handle items like this and every constructed/purchased item should also be sellable for the same reason. Minor complaints and they didn't take away from my pure enjoyment of the game but would have loved to be part of a beta to point these things out.

A complete game in a sense, but lacks compelling gameplay, dragging out most tasks into the waiting time. An example is holding a sermon, a once-weekly task to generate the faith resource. The week takes a total of about 45 minutes to rotate, leaving you waiting literally days worth of real time to acquire it. Progress is dragged out over extended wait periods with little to do in certain windows of that time.

Furthermore, looking at the achievements should highlight that the game dev considers DLC as part of the core experience, despite not being necessary, the DLC solves issues that shouldn't be in the base game. The grand total of all DLC and core game content costs $50.

The game doesn't bring much original content either for that pricetag. A juggle of tasks without much reward, grinding out repetitive tasks for points, and a skilltree that constantly stagnates progress further than even the faith you need from that 45 minute week. Fishing is literally a poor copy-paste of what you'd see in other games (like Stardew). Dialogue is flat, narrative is driven by forced acceptance and about as shallow as a puddle.

Six quest lines are actually important as they are the ones that get you to the end and six merge to three which then give you two rewards each all of which are your rube-goldberg machine finales for an arduous painful series of never ending tasks. Honestly I haven’t played the DLCs and at this point I don’t want to if its more of the same. I was going to go on and on about its similarities and differences to other games but I can say for certain that a list of things that upset me would be easier.
-	The donkey comes just before sundown to give you a body only if you have carrots in the box before noon. The donkey brings one body a day. The body is on an rng scale of its conditions and no matter what you do your percentages of messing the body up early game are good. I never did it early game but it would have been easier for me to just throw the bodies down by the cremation area until I had the ability to burn bodies rather than bury a -6 body because I didn’t understand that I wasn’t supposed to continue to harvest or that there was a way to do stuff and then having early game to exhume for over a silver only after getting the ability to use royal services was crazy. But don’t stop harvesting meat, blood, skin, fat, or bone because they are useful. Items like intestines, brains, and hearts are useless as far as I could tell almost 60 hours in. Honestly the body stuff was the main point of this game and it was also the most tedious irritating part and if you just said screw it I wont give them carrots for a bit until I get things going you will find early that you wont get money.
-	Sewing seeds takes no energy but pulling them out of the ground does and just starting farming is expensive especially carrots as the diminishing returns are there. My advice is to get six composting piles immediately and keep adding the crop waste and eat the maggots for energy increases. Best way to make money I found was trade with the merchant for gold star grape seeds and make wine and sell it exclusively next to the meat and burial certificates. You could also burn witches while selling human hamburgers and beer at the witch hill place as it gives you around 33 silver. The merchant trading company isn’t worth it late game and with all the effort only gives a gold and a half for a full week. You will need full in game weeks just to get a very necessary piece of paper. The grind was the worst part about this.
-	The game tends to give you better mechanics than some games, such as you can regen health and move quicker and get better items that increase your productivity and also zombies that do the work for you provided you know how to make their bodies work well. That being said the game was one of the biggest slogs I have ever had to endure and I wish I never started it.

I cant stress enough, this is a unique take on the genre. i like playing it.

that being said theres a long long list of little quality of life issues that eventually make you realize what an obstacle they are. for starters, you cant get rid of certain items like old tools. eventually they will degrade and you cant use them but you will never be able to get rid of them in any way. there are a lot of ""upgraded"" structures and items but once you start getting more complex recipes and tasks, you run out of storage very quickly. and since you have to build in specific spots, you really have to keep track of everything everywhere at all times. 
theres no way to improve how you move around the world, you walk at the same frustrating speed. this especially gives me a headache in the ""dungeon"" section of the game.
the ""tier"" system of items prolongs crafting. i dont exactly know how to explain how its an issue, but if you play, youll see how the bronze silver and gold versions of items is obnoxious as fuck.

I particularly liked the whole graveyard dynamic, it feels different from the traditional crafting experience. They could have made it a simple ""craft and build"", but instead created this complex corpse/body parts/grave dynamic which makes the whole thing a lot more interesting.

Something I absolutely love and hope more of these type of games implement, is that even even though there is a day/night cycle and a week cycle, there is no urgency to do anything. All tasks will wait indefinitely for you, which alleviates a lot of the stress that comes with the a timer countdown. And even though npcs do have a schedule, it's usually always just a few minutes away and you have more than a few ways to just make time pass to whatever timeframe you want.

I play these games to unwind and relax. The first thing I do on these games is implement a mod to remove timer reestrictions, so it was refreshing to see this game already had this covered from the get go.

The world itself is simple and has a dark humor to it, but more importantly is a lot of fun to explore.

Crafting is well balanced and all dependencies are well structured, even if it takes a while to get the hang of it for the first few hours (leading to the proverbial ""where the hell do I find that?"")

On the downsides, the first few hours can be very confusing as you learn all these intrinsic mechanics. Quests are not very clear on what you need to do IF you leave a task unattended for a long time. It's easy to come back to a quest and wonder how are you supposed to finish it since the npc conversation is long gone and it's hard to remember everything you are told.

A more tight interface for the branching trees would be better as well as a conversation log or even an encyclopedia of items in game that retains what you have discovered so far.

Still, overall, I've had a ton of fun and it's a game that is easy to recommend. I ended up purchasing it on Steam AND switch because I was enjoying myself so much.

However, the switch version is laggy and performs poorly for a game that apparently doesn't take that many resoruces. PC plays great, switch version... not so much, but it's still enjoyable.",1666018982,1666018982,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A flawed gem. There's a good deal wrong with this game but no game breaking bugs so before I get into why I loved this game here's a list of the bad things you need to be aware of in the base game. I haven't played any DLC.

[b]-Spelling and grammar are bad fairly often[/b]
Not a huge deal and the story is still easy to follow but the quality could be vastly improved by having a native English speaker fix the dialogue.

[b]-There's a lot of things in this game that make no sense from a design standpoint.[/b]
You can recycle every tier of wood and stone grave fixtures to help with their upgrades or to reclaim some resources but you can't do that with marble.

Selling items in this game is a mess and renders so many crops and items useless to make.

You can grow a wide variety of fruits, vegetables and grains but you can only sell the basic produce that don't have a quality tier. Only through working with a certain NPC can you sell silver and gold quality crops but even then that's somewhat limited.

You cannot stack cooking orders for items that have quality tiers meaning you have to keep coming back or stand and wait to mass produce.

[b]The dungeon is boring[/b]
This game was't built for combat but you do unlock a 15 level dungeon teeming with enemies that do have attack patterns but it never mattered that they did. Just bring enough potions and food then basically tank the hits with good gear. It was the most tedious part of this crafting and grind heavy game.

[h1]The good bits[/h1]

Despite all these minor bugs and baffling design decisions I loved this game. When I first started playing it felt like the game was just parodying other games like Harvest Moon or Rune Factory but it actually has a lot of heart.

[b]Backstory[/b]
You're basically a guy from our world who is brought over to this dark fantasy land after being hit by a car. It basically opens like a bad anime. The backstory is that a place called 'The Town' (You live in 'The Village' by the way. I know, so creative) is suffering through a drought and famine. Because of this a 'Ship of the Dead' has been unable to leave port due to the river drying up in The Town. This is why you have so many bodies to bury. You have one mission, get back home to your Love.

[b]What did I like about Graveyard Keeper?[/b]

I enjoyed pretty much every aspect. Between tending to your graveyard, holding sermons every 7 days, crafting, gathering, farming, merchanting slogging through that boring dungeon you don't really run out of things to do. It's a grind for sure but not a bad one. Just throw on something to listen too while you play.

There's a lot of NPC's that you can't interact with in this game which is fine since you're not Mr. Important and they got stuff to do. To finish the game however you need to do the quests of around 6 main NPC's but I won't tell you who. The story was quite good. Funny but surprising is an apt description.

My favourite part of the game is the skill tree. It allows you to advance at your own pace, only unlocking new crafts when you feel ready to tackle them.

Do be aware if you make the 26 point zombies and complete your farm with them you will fill all available chests with food very quickly.  Also eventually the farmer pays you nothing after you've sold him enough vegetables - seriously got to 1 copper quickly which I was fine with since I had so much but then it hit zero and what was the point then!  Switch to wheat since even when that gets to zero you can grind it (quickly after the mill quest) and sell flour although I got that to 1 copper also I never sold enough to get to zero at least.  Zombie farms save on fertilizer which saves time but do tend to eventually run out of seeds so keep a stockpile.  I ended up with a ridiculous stockpile of resources by game end (which was very satisfying in and of itself) but probably didn't have to collect everything all the time.

+ Good concept. 

- Terrible execution of its theme almost 99% of the way through. Every little task is coupled with even more redundant, minute tasks to achieve a small goal. This is mainly a major complaint about the ridiculous crafting system. 
- The crafting system is inane, messy, and over-encumbered with useless items. There are a SLEW (probably more than 90% of the whole game's catalog) of items that become entirely useless after one use, or there's simply no incentive to grind the resources over and over again for the slight benefit of ""higher quality"" items. Potions? Literally only used healing potions and never found that I had a want or need to craft the other potions. The 15 level dungeon is not hard enough to require the use of stat-boosting items. 
- The dungeon's idea of ""difficulty"" is just swarming you with more monsters. You can retreat into a corridor or the prior room to take out any monsters that followed you, easily. If you decide to save up all the knowledge points necessary to craft the additional armor/weapons, chances are you've already progressed the story/dungeon past the need for them. 
- You can employ zombies to do grinding tasks for you; this is only worth it for grinding logs and mined materials. Everything else? You're better off just doing it yourself to pad out all the time that you have to wait in between daily NPCs. 
- The task list is extremely vague so you have to keep notes open for the small hope of remembering what your fucking objectives are. God forbid you take a week off from this game because of how much of a slog it is to complete. Talking to the NPCs again doesn't even remind you of what you're supposed to be doing for them. 
- Which is another thing. WHY are the NPCs only present once a week? Sure, difficulty to achieve your goal on time is one thing, but I'm convinced this literally only exists for the sake of punishing the player and padding out time! The game does not need to be 90% waiting for the right day to proceed a quest--which isn't to mention the fact that sometimes those quests will make you wait another week, and another week after that. I'd have less gripe about this if it were executed effectively, but frankly, you reach a point in the plot where you literally just have to wait. 
- The ending is so fucking facetious. (Slight spoiler ahead, not that it even begins to fully encapsulate the extreme nothingness you get out of this ending. It's about as satisfying as a ruined orgasm, so if you're a masochist, that's probably right up your alley.) You spend the entire game raising relationships with NPCs to get items for the sole purpose of returning home, but once that goal is completed, it fades to fucking black where a goddamn Donkey complains about greedy capitalists to try to peddle the game's DLCs. The entire fucking game is just a setup for DLCs. Controversial opinion, a game doesn't need DLCs if it already has the plot and utilities necessary to add it in to begin with. You're purposely mincing the damn game so you can convince people to spend more money on your dog shit game.  
- I really don't care to bicker about quality control in dialogue with typos. But this game is riddled with typos and missing words that butcher sentences, and ultimately ruin what the characters are actually trying to tell you. 
- Discover-ability in this game is minimum. There are minor instances where you can learn what an item is good for, but otherwise, you have to brute-force and guess what said item can be used to make (this mostly refers to shit like potions and injections). 
- Overall, this game is chock full of ideas that would be great in theory, but its execution falls extremely short with the majority of its mechanics; it feels half-baked. 
- Oh, and if you create a game where the user has to consult the wiki and forums to complete its tasks, then it's not a well designed game. Period.",1665237374,1665237374,False,17,1,0.602915108203887939,0,True,False,False

I can also confidently say i'll never play it again, the game just becomes increasingly annoying to deal with the longer you play.

Spoilers-
Now i'll take a moment to list various problems I have with the game, this will be a bit specific so this where you should stop reading if you want a experience without spoils.

Too many crafting stations: some get upgraded or replaced but there is just too much running between them all, this is most egregious with the potion crafting where one is used to make potions with 2 ingredients and the other with 3?! obviously should be a upgrade so you can do both on the first station.

Potion Crafting: you're better off looking up the recipes or buying them from the witch, the game should all honestly record failed recipe attempts, there are so many combinations you need a pen and paper to try them all, thankfully are are a few ways to craft some potions.

Too many unsellable items: Many items have no vendors to sell them to, mainly referring to various food and crafting ingredients that you get loads of, a extra bit of annoyance is some vendors are only available once a week (6 day week)

Aristocrat Papers: Over needed in quests, should really be needed one, the amount of money you need to grind to get them is a problem

Late Game Money: Speaking of money, once you've purchased the Aristocrat Papers you'll practically never need money again...

Building: Most builds are freely placed for some reason? this game really didn't need this freedom. There are various builds that have little choice or even no choice in their placement so giving us the freedom just slows the game down for no reason (Mainly where burning bodies are concerned), not to mention some structures immediately build in their designated spot so its a question why at least the ones with no choice aren't the same. The designated build areas are annoying to work around either being just too small or too big to make use of the space efficiently which yes is more of a personal problem (OCD)  

Questionable Dialogue: Some dialogue can trigger out of order, perhaps I should've documented the exact instances since the 2 cases I ran into may be bugs? or simplify a oversight.

Quest Waiting: Some quests ask you to return in a week, TONS of waiting if you're focusing on a particular quest.

Unobtainable perk: there's a perk bonus listed in various crafting interfaces that is actually unobtainable unless you have the DLC ;D lovely

walking anywhere is painfully slow - which is also a mechanic for progress balance in a sense - remembering to do the thing (and walking around in the dark cause you took too long deciding what you'd bring) is part of the experience a sense. 

The game isn't timed. If you forget to see a character the one day a week they're visible you can ""just do it next week"" but if it unlocks stuff that means progress is limited for that time - and there's no ingame cost for that. In fact you'll be mildy richer by then probably. Though you could have been more richer if you had planned your route better...

It's an easy (though grindy) game in that you can't really fail (other than giving up) - but it has complexity and planning well can make you progress a lot faster - but it doesn't provide much info up front to make planning possible (unless you read the wiki or are replaying) - though the discovery can be fun too. And the grind itself is somewhat fun.

I love the way different quests are connected and how progress is locked in this elaborate way that makes ingame sense (i.e. it's not ""you can't do this until you're level 7"" - it's ""You haven't established a close enough relationship with the Astrologer to just bring up this evil book you want him to steal for you..."" Yeah makes sense - but that means you have to do all the quests that involve him up to that point to do it but you don't even think about it that way! It's a genious way to have some control over what order folks do quests in and gives a great sense of goose chase (which is somewhat enjoyable gameplay, if it's meaningful, which here it is, since it's not completely unrelated fetch quests; or it sort of is, but they all tie together nicely!)

There are lots of fun things scattered around outside managing your Graveyard from the Main Quest to the side quests and basically finding ways to make everything easier. Everything is a mystery when it come's to Graveyard Keeper and there's no better way to uncover these mysteries by exploring everything.

It's a fun game for sure specially for those who are really into Management type game. But of course it's not a perfect game for everybody. So here are some of the cons that i find while playing Graveyard Keeper.

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
- Overwhelming to casual players at the start
Stuff to do will come one after another with very little room to take a breather at the start
this makes new players feel stressed and usually stop playing from there. But this should be
a problem for those familiar with these types of games as it contributes to more stuff to do
it's just that it really gets confusing at the start.

- You don't really feel connected with the character you're playing as
sure you know why you're there and what the main goal is but at the same time the guy who
you're playing as isn't relatable. You cant personalize the character. plus his goal is to leave
this place. Meanwhile you as a player have already invested way too much on the stuff in this
world, helping and upgrading so it's a bit of a conflict between interest i guess but that's just 
me.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
- Lots of things to do 
- Skills you can specialize or Master Everything
- Friendship progression with characters
- Big map filled with mysteries and deeper lore to theorize
- Tedious but satisfying grind
- Characters are filled with personality
- Weird af

Pros: 
+ Early game was enjoyable while new characters and game systems were being revealed
+ Pleasant soundtrack and artistic style
+ Novel theme that seamlessly blends cute and macabre tones

Cons:
- Core gameplay loop is too grindy. After you open up the map, meet all the characters, and unlock the base systems of the game, the novelty fades and the grindy core gameplay loop starts to show
- Quest lines are extremely shallow. Most quests are just fetch quests that either net you a small amount of mid-level crafting resources or enough favor with the character to start another pointless fetch quest. 
- Late game feels pointless. After about 5 hours, it felt like I was grinding through the crafting system for no reason other than to marginally increase the rating of my graveyard, which didn't feel rewarding at all

I only played the base version of the game, so some of these complaints may be addressed in the DLCs.

conclusion below for people who don't care to read my walls of text :)

[h1]Theme[/h1]
As the name suggests, Graveyard Keeper puts you in the shoes of a jack-of-all-trades caretaker. Just the thought of a game with this premise likely conjures up all kinds of imagery for potential morbid mechanics. In fact, you likely came up with more interesting mechanics in letting your mind wonder the possibilities than the devs did while developing the game. The game completely wastes its premise. All aspects of maintaining and expanding the graveyard are overly simplistic and come down to a binary choice; Can I improve the quality of this corpse enough? If no, harvest all organs and cremate it. If yes, either bury the corpse to improve the graveyard, or turn it into a zombie for automation. There is an amount of depth in the preparation of corpses, but this depth comes solely from the obfuscation of relevant information. There's no real planning to the lay-out of your graveyard, its all simply linear progression to meet pre-set narrative goals. Harvesting organs in a game like Rimworld feels morbid because its not a requirement for you to meet your goals. You choose to harvest those organs, likely out of a morbid curiosity to see how bad things can get. Graveyard keeper isn't like that. The darkest the game gets is selling human meat as if it were from an animal, but this is practically a requirement to finish the game. When the game forces you to do messed up things, its not nearly as fun. Especially when the game doesn't even acknowledge the fact that yes, you did indeed just sell human-meat hamburgers to a bunch of peasants at a witch burning. Being evil is only fun when you let the little devil on your shoulder take control, not when 'the game' tells you to do it. Apart from a few jokes early on the dark comedy aspect is completely absent from the game. Its nothing more than a way to get people in the door, when in reality the game is a bog standard progression-based farming game.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Bog standard might be a little too generous. This game is about one thing and one thing only; grinding. You grind resources to get to higher tiers of resources to make better things, eventually being able to automate parts of it through the use of zombies. All that is relatively normal for this type of game. However, a ton of your progression is locked behind narrative events, which are in turn locked behind certain resource quotas. You don't have much a choice in what you want to do because you have to do EVERYTHING. If you neglect one aspect of the game for too long, it will bite you in the behind and lock you out of progression until you get it up to standard. All these separate resource production elements (mining, farming, fishing, fighting) lack any kind of depth. They are not fun to engage with because they require no strategy and little planning. All of this could have been passable, if not for the one final nail in the digital coffin (which are ironically absent from this game); there's no creativity to it. Almost every single thing is predetermined by the game. You get to choose where to place things within their designated zones, but most of those zones are so small that there's really only one place you can put it. Everything goes in its own pre-designated area, you gotta play by the rules of the game. You're not building up your own farm/graveyard, you're simply going through the progression steps set by the developers. Everybody mentions how this game is similar to Stardew Valley, and they are right in the sense that they are both progression/farming games. However, despite my own reservations in regards to the design behind Stardew Valley, that game is astronomically better for the simple fact that you have complete free reign in how to develop your farm and the level of customization it offers. Stardew Valley gives me a feeling of ownership. I did that, I planned it, I made the choices, I did the work. Graveyard Keeper makes me feel like I just finished a lego set. Its nice to look at but ultimately it was all just guided busywork.

[h1]Narrative[/h1]
Now while the gameplay and theming were undercooked, they don't compare to the freshly slaughtered corpse that is the game's story. You are a modern man who gets sent off to a medieval world after he's killed in a car accident in the real world.  the Keeper's goal is to get back to 'his love' in the real world. We haven't met his love, we don't know what their relationship is like, all we know is that he wants to get back to her. Of course, this leaves the player with no investment in the protagonist's paper thin motivation. Its nothing more than an excuse for the game to have an ending and for the writers to sprinkle in a small handful of lukewarm jokes. The actual narrative revolves around six main characters that you have to help, which serve as the previously mentioned resource gates. You get far too little time to interact with these characters for their stories to create any form of emotional attachment. Worst of all, each character arbitrarily only shows up one specific day of the week. This means if you just missed them because your crops weren't done growing you gotta wait a full week to make your delivery and progress their story, which is likely preventing you from progressing other stories. There's a very high likelihood that the game will completely slow down to a crawl at the end because while you have all the resources you need, you will have to wait several weeks for the final character quest line to complete. The game constantly mentions these seemingly interesting locations and characters, but never actually allows you to go there or meet them. At one point the game even pulls a bait and switch where you think you're going to finally go to the place you've been hearing about for so long that seems much more interesting than the lifeless countryside you've been stuck in up until that point, only to kill you at the gate and go ""lmao no"". To top it all off if you do manage to finish the game the devs added a 'funny' little segment at the end where they essentially say ""Oh yeah you wanted to see the interesting stuff? Nah, we don't have the budget. But hey, maaaaybe if you buy the DLC?"". What a way to treat your audience.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Graveyard Keeper is an undercooked progression game that fails to deliver any form of meaningful gameplay or depth. It barely interacts with the core thematic elements beyond the most basic level and lacks the dark comedy that one would expect from this type of game. The player has very little agency in the development of their graveyard and farm as they are pushed along a predetermined linear path. The story is an excuse at best and a frustrating progression gate at worst, and like the gameplay has no depth. Instead it opts for the comedic route, but even that is barely present. Progression-based games are naturally engaging, but this one will leave you feeling empty and unaccomplished.

Music and art are pretty decent though.

What it does right:

- Zombies are a fun game-within-a-game and automating the most tedious Harvest Moon style tasks is a godsend.
- Story has a mysterious, allegorical vibe for most of the game.
- Good balance of humor and gravitas. Doesn't try to be silly, but has some funny lines.
- Offers alternative methods for completing quests. Almost everything for quests is purchasable or earnable in another way than the quest giver suggests. I think truly everything is obtainable without actually doing the suggested objective with the DLCs.

What it does wrong:

- Lots (and lots and lots) of waiting around another week because you barely missed an NPC, or for story reasons, or because the quest objective is RNG and you didn't get the Dark Heart this week, or because the quest has a short follow-up objective you didn't know about and you waited too late in the day to do what you thought was a simple turn-in. There are far better ways to handle quest objectives.
- Small inventory size and slow movespeed means you'll spend a ton of your time juggling inventory between the many crafting areas and a dozen or more boxes.
- Generally bad decisions about what to show the player and when to show it (e.g. Cultist).
- Last quarter of the story is terrible. The ending is crushingly anti-climactic. There are tons and tons of loose ends. Many bold-text locations the NPCs mention simply do not exist in the game. Many concepts and storylines just poof. After the final scene (if you can even call it that) NPCs pop up on a black backdrop to mention all these problems and then say something like ""well we had to leave room for DLC!"" That's a tacky excuse for lazy writing.
- No postgame goals other than getting even more currency you can't spend. Even a some achievements to encourage post-game continuation of play so you could really enjoy the economic engine you created would have been nice.

It took me ~60 hours to beat it and most of its DLC, as well as get most achievements, but I feel a solid 10-20 of those hours were sheer tedium, either spent waiting on someone to show up or something to happen or slowly walking from point A to B or just moving inventory around. Early on I would have recommended this game, but by the end the tedium has snowballed and the total disappointment of an ending really made me ask ""why did I bother?""

[b]Addendum - DLC Guide[/b]

Many QoL features are hidden in DLC, making some simply better than others. I encourage you to rush to finish those first, especially before the main quest, as they'll save you plenty of time.

[b]Stranger Sins[/b] - You build and run a bar. Good source of money if you can automate it with Zombies, but by the time I was raking in money, I didn't need it anymore. Good additions to the background story. Not needed for QoL.

[b]Game of Crone[/b] - You build up a refugee camp, which eventually becomes self-sustaining and can provide you another source of multiple resources, especially foodstuffs. Story is OK, but the main draw is [b]BAGS[/b]. Yes, you can finally expand your tiny inventory, and even get bags that self-organize by category eventually! Must-have, but only if you make it a top priority - the bags don't come til over halfway through.

[b]Better Save Soul[/b] - You restore a soul-healing facility, which is basically another corpse system. Grants some powerful customization tools and another path to obnoxious products like books and fertilizer, but most notably it allows you to control stations remotely, through the power of ghosts. Ghost power cost is 1:1 with energy cost, so not only can they do anything for cost, they can run anything that doesn't actually require energy (like zombie farms, random text generators, etc) for free! Good to have and unlocks quickly, so it doesn't need to be your priority.",1636345540,1663985296,False,20,0,0.706399977207183838,0,True,False,False

Story tasks, technology unlocks, pretty much all progression in the game is like this. This robes the player of a sense of achievement; where normally you'd be like ""Hey, I unlocked [New Thing], that's a milestone!"" in this game it's ""I've finally unlocked [objective I've been working toward for 10 hours], now I'm only two steps away from [new objective that cropped up halfway through working towards what I just completed].""
- Crafting as an integral component of them game but with a lack of recipes. I could tolerate the forced trial-by-error (it makes sense from a narrative standpoint) if the UI was more cooperative. But there's no way to know in-game what you've already tried, you need to use an external source to keep track of your failures. And there will be a lot of failures; need to force the player to grind for extra ingredients after all.
- Things in general are poorly explained. I had to look up how to fish. To fish. One of the simplest minigames in modern build-em-ups. And I don't mean ""how to get gud at fishing"" I mean mechanically how to do it. It was like two lines of text, there's no good reason that couldn't've been placed on the screen when I pulled out the fishing rod the first time.
- You're constantly doing things for other people. The character's motivation is to get home, and he needs to do *all this rigmarole* to achieve it. Games like these are normally about building a nifty operation for yourself, but you're constantly reminded that you're ultimately doing all this stuff for other, often unsympathetic, characters.
- NPCs are little more than questgivers. Sure, they have personalities, but there's no reason to talk to them outside of quest stuff - and if you do, they don't have much to say. While this feels like a lived-in world, it's one you're excluded from.
- Forced grinding for resources. One of the most egregious examples is how X-quality ingredients don't always make X-quality products. If a quest requires you to get a certain number of gold-quality items, but with your base ingredients you have only a 60% chance of getting gold, congrats, you're wasting resources!

Having said that, I think there are some gravely under-utilized mechanics and others that are too heavily relied upon. The weather: there is a variety of interesting weather patterns including wind, rain, and fog, but as far as I could tell, they don't impact the gameplay much, if at all. It's a missed opportunity. I checked the riverbed behind the house plenty of times in rain to see if they had a higher chance to spawn slimes, for instance. Farmed plants don't need to be watered, and impaired vision isn't a mechanic. I kept wondering if NPCs walking past zombies (or equally suspicious things) would trigger Inquisition hunts that would utilize the alternate routes and footprints. Turns out you don't have to be remotely secretive about your activities, and attempting a no-zombie run, for instance, seems not worth the effort. I'm upset that the aristocratic papers are so heavily relied upon for everyone's questlines. Especially because the Charm/Astrologer line locks at like 70% until you get them. Thereby creating a over-reliance on meditation late-game. The last two hours of gameplay were just spent meditating, waiting for entire weeks to loop just to speak with the same NPC. And you never get to enter the Town even though it's all that the NPCs talked about. Horatio also mentions possibly fixing up the Dead Horse Tavern, but that's not implemented either. There's so many things that I realize are disappointing only now that the game is over because I held out some hope that they would matter in some way.

There are a LOT of bugs. I've run to quite a few that will literally block you from progressing a DLC. I haven't encountered a bug where it stops you from progressing through the base game, which is good, but it feels like a waste of money if I can't even finish a DLC I paid for. And yes, I did report this bug, 2 years ago, and it hasn't been fixed as far as I know.

If there's a lot of bugs, then why continue playing it, you may ask. This game, is addicting. Very much so. Very micro manage-y, which is some people like me love. There's just so much to do and it gets really chaotic, and that's where the fun is. The lore is interesting and humorous. There's a ton of references to different media.

I recommend this game for those who like grinding for stuff like a mindless zombie and those who like micro managing tasks. The graphics are cute and sometimes morbid with a bit of humor, and really adds charm to the game.

Though this is a warning to those who will buy all the DLCs:
Progress the storyline as intended, do no deviate too much from the main one or else the progression of one DLC will literally break. This won't bar you from getting the ""main"" ending but it will suck that you won't be able to do one ending.",1661872782,1661872782,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This gameplay is has you trying to do twenty things each day, but not enough time to do them all. That's all good, because creating a graveyard, a church, and farming business is all really fun. The crafting interplay is excellent, and I enjoyed the very interesting technology progression.

There are many downsides which all require referencing the unofficial out-of-game wiki: Nearly every quest chain is hard to understand, starting right from the tutorial. The quests often depend on other, unknown quests to be resolved. And, while new technology provides new buildings, the game offers no description of their usage. Lastly, there are several gameplay components that are simply non-functional and many more that do not match their description.

And then, there is the technical micro-stuttering often mentioned in the community forums. That is going to be a problem for a lot of people, and it doesn't show up until a dozen hours of playing and keeps getting worse and worse. This is where the screen pauses for a split-second while moving, over and over, and it causes me a slight feeling of seasickness.

Lastly, the game is long. Really long. That might be a good thing or bad thing, depending on how much you want to just chill into being in this game world. But I can see from the Steam Achievements that only 29% of owners got the story-based one for the Necronomicon. That's only half-way through the game story, so those 98% of owners who got the tutorial-based achievement did not stick around even that long. That's too bad, because the end-game Alchemy Technology is excellent multi-stage crafting. I can understand how someone would bail-out of this game, after a dozen hours of annoying questlines, neglected descriptions, and increasing micro-stuttering and leave a Not Recommended review.

All that said, I am recommending this game because they nailed the theme of dark-fantasy, that I enjoy, combined with the open-direction, stardew-valley style gameplay that makes me feel I am engaged in that world. And another really, really big reason is the ""recently departed"" technology tree that is super interesting.

So in the end, I got to take part in this very weird world, on an Ubuntu Linux desktop computer. I used both a keyboard and mouse and then a gamepad controller.

The learning curve is forced on you, you need to talk to certain NPCs to unlock certain things, even though you can have all the items required for said things way beforehand. This devalues the NPCs, making them just a progression check.. an annoying couple of clicks you have to do, but they are across the map.. only on certain days and among all the stuff that gets thrown at you, you've probably forgotten all about the quest to begin with. There's a lot of progression gating, it makes the game feel more like a resource collecting simulator instead of being a graveyard keeper..

Even in the first moments, you're fetching wine for a talking skull (blocks progression), talking with about 12 other NPCs that all throw quests at you immediately (which, block progression), and then finally, when you unlock something, it falls flat because it doesn't feel worth all the effort.

It takes a lot of inspiration from Stardew Valley and you can perform here some similar activities such as sowing, harvesting, fishing, and dungeon crawling. But this game cuts down on the silly romance options (which I didn't like in Stardew Valley at all) in favour of deeper mechanics, more crafting, and a healthy dose of dark humour on top. You will be all a parish priest, a grave digger, a mortician, the Inquisitor's errand boy, and the practitioner of the dark arts at the same time. What's not to like? 

In all seriousness, though, the game is very much about resource management and crafting. My goodness, there is a metric tonne of crafting in here! I'm usually not a fan of survival games with lots of crafting, but this one does it really well and I don't mind it here, I actually enjoy it. One thing I'm especially glad about is that there is no one running after you, no running out of time, no tax collector coming every Friday. You progress from one activity to another at your own pace. You never have to ""make it on time"" and plan your crops a month ahead to harvest just before some silly summer festival, you instead grow crops when you feel you need to. The same goes for digging for resources and crafting. For that reason alone I consider this game quite a meditative experience. What's more, if you don't like fishing and don't want to spend hours hunting for that one species of fish which can be only found at a specific time of day at a specific spot in a specific season which you need to complete some quest (something that I found VERY annoying in Stardew Valley), in Graveyard Keeper in 9 cases out of 10 you will be able to find someone who will sell you that fish. For a price, of course, but still. 

What I found most satisfying in Graveyard Keeper were the actual graveyard maintenance and slow renovation and expansion of your parish church. It gives some deeper meaning to all the resource gathering and crafting which are, in all honesty, quite repetitive activities. It provides you with a sense of direction, aside of the specific goals that are set before you to progress the main quest. After some 50+ hours I still haven't finished the game, I simply find it too relaxing to rush it to the end. I'll finish it one day, I'm sure, but for now...

There are no seasons, day and night don't matter as you work however long or short you want and often only rest when you run out of stamina-restoring items or get the ""sleepy"" debuff (that is basically just a reminder to save your game, because you can wake up again immediately if you want and still remove it). Food is extremely plentiful, and most items are worth very little to sell, so you might as well just eat the food for more stamina to keep working until you get a good opportunity to rest again.

There is farming, but you're best off not overdoing it, because you can't really profitably sell crops so you'll end up overflowing with cabbages and nothing to do with all of them if you farm too much. You'll be chopping a lot of trees and harvesting a lot of stone, making a lot of metal parts and grave decorations, experimenting with alchemy, cooking, brewing alcohol, and writing books, and then right before you feel like you're done with all the things you needed to do immediately, you'll suddenly be interrupted by the ding ding ding of a new corpse showing up at the morgue for you to process before it spoils. And then you'll realize your bag is full of stuff you picked up that you have to travel to various boxes to file away in their proper places, remember that you needed more wood to build more cremation piles, remember that you wanted to get more honey to bake more muffins, and then you'll notice your farm crops are ripe, and you'll have a dozen new things to capture your attention. And then you'll realize it's sunday and you've got to run down to the church to get the Faith points necessary to build something else you needed.

I rarely found the time to go exploring the dungeon to do some combat, because I swear every time I went down there, the corpse bell rang or I got sleepy pretty much immediately. Good thing it doesn't respawn enemies when I leave, so I can chip away at a floor a little bit at a time when I have a spare moment, like that ever happens. You can automate certain tasks, which helps a little bit. Once you're at the very end of the game with plenty of automation running, there are certainly fewer things to do yourself, and it gets more relaxing.

The story is very nonlinear. The different NPCs give you quests, but there's a good chance you won't be in a position to complete them immediately, or even know HOW to complete them immediately. I played through the main story the first time without looking up how to do things at all, and many things were a complete mystery to me at first. The UI is not kind about helping you understand how things work and what kinds of technology will get you what you need, but if you enjoy figuring things like that out as I do, it's a definite plus. I only had to look up one thing at the very end to finish the game -- I couldn't for the life of me figure out how to get hops seeds, but they ended up being sold in the second tier of a merchant I only rarely spoke to and would not have guessed would sell hops.

One annoyance is that each core NPC only shows up once on each of the six weekdays, so if they ask you to do something, you likely won't be able to run off and get it for them on the same day, so you'll be waiting through a whole week of random chores before you have another chance to continue their quest line. On a number of occasions, that next quest was just ""talk to me next week"" throwing another week of delay into the quest, assuming you didn't lose track of what day it is by then and forget to visit them at the proper time entirely. It's more likely that their next quest gets filed away in your ""to be completed eventually"" mental list than to get any kind of priority over anything else you're doing.

Overall it took me almost a month to finish the game, playing probably about 2-3 hours per day on average, which ended up being almost 400 in-game days. Despite this, I've only unlocked half of the available achievements, because there are three DLC available to continue the game! I pretty much immediately bought the Stranger Sins DLC (if there was a bundle of just the DLC for a discount, I would have just gotten them all, but as it is, no reason not to just buy them as I play them) and started a new game to build a tavern, and have already sunk over a hundred game days into that one.

[/spoiler] 
all these locations where you can [i] just barely [/i] see things to interact with but that are blocked off, i thought there'd eventually be a way to get there - rocks you can mine, a vein of coal, those dead shrubs you can dig up for sticks. as you head further west in the swamp, you can see mushrooms and trees at the very edges of your field of view. even the appearance of witch hill on the map - the two sides you can climb up but the middle [i] still [/i] being shrouded in clouds - seems to suggest that it's something you'll uncover later. there's also that wall of rocks to the north of your house that says there's no way it can be cleared [spoiler] and i guess there really isn't. [/spoiler] 
i was [i] so [/i] excited to [spoiler] save vagner from the mountain fort bc i thought you'd be able to go explore a new location - a sprawling castle, maybe! like the dungeon! they even mention an old archaeological site and i was really getting my hopes up to unlock more of the map. and then those hopes were quickly dashed by a cutscene. [/spoiler] likewise with [spoiler] the town. you get struck by lightning and there's this cryptic message about dark forces preventing you from entering the town and i really thought that that would factor into the story somewhere, but it never does. [/spoiler] when i discovered electric powder, i got excited again and thought oh! [spoiler] maybe you craft some sort of lightning resistance that allows you in! but that never happened. so i kept playing and thought well, maybe it'll open up after the ending - you can explore all those just-out-of-reach areas and maybe have another little house in the town and surely [i] this [/i] will be the thing to open up a whole new section of the map! nope. just the cutscene of being struck by lightning. it remains inaccessible. 
it really makes the whole post-ending of ""that's it?"" and the donkey talking about them putting a whole bunch of new things into DLC to sell later [/spoiler] feel a lot less like a cute joke and more just kinda bleak. it's a shame bc i actually love the grind of the game - it's such a satisfying roster of little tasks to do and at times can even feel sort of meditative. you really fall into the groove of this being your daily life and start to put in the work to maintain your graveyard, church, garden, etc. and there's a kind of sense of accomplishment in it. 
i suppose if i'm [i] really [/i] itching for more, i can [spoiler] do the exact thing the post-ending bit seems to encourage and buy the other DLCs, start up a new game with them, enjoy the journey for what it is. [/spoiler] but there'll always be this nagging sense of [i] knowing [/i] that i'll reach this same point of having nothing new to do and nowhere new to go. even now, i know that [spoiler] none of the DLC open up anywhere new on the map.

Overall, I definitely recommend this game. I have about fifty hours sunk into it so far, and I'm significantly through the main quests. Pros/cons outlined below. The game is definitely addictive, as I've only been playing about a week and already have so many hours into it. Much like other reviews have said, the game is a lot like Stardew Valley, but I enjoy this much more than Stardew. 

Cons:
The game is NOT intuitive, and you can easily softlock yourself into a corner by making easy mistakes or doing things out  of order.
Crafting is insanely time intensive and you can easily have four to five tiers of activities you need to do to make one item (ie. you want a potion. that  potion requires 2 - 3 items. Each of those items needs 2 - 3 items to craft. You need to find or make those items. But they each require different tools/equipment to make, so if  they aren't unlocked or built yet you have to go to that. the equipment takes anywhere from 3 - 5 items to make. Those items have to be made and each require 2 - 3 ingredients or steps. It takes hours and by the time you get the equipment made you can't always recall that this all started cause you wanted a healing potion.
There are some hard breaks coded into the game that still need bugged out. (ie. if your mortuary is full of corpses and you go open the church, it bugs out and even after burying the bodies the donkey will never return to proceed with his quests so you will never get another body. Ever)
THERE IS NO TOWN. The town is a lie. I don't know why the plot and characters talk about it so much, because it doesn't exist in this version of the game.
Fishing sucks. Just like Stardew lol.

Pros: Fun, dark humor. I like the humor of this game, and the way the different characters are written.
Addicting to play. Even with the annoying crafting difficulties, once you grind through it you can get to a point where you can make zombies to work for you.
Lots of fun achievements. I am a sucker for achievements and this one has TONS to get, so if you're a completionist like me, you'll enjoy it.

Over all, I would consider this game a mixed review, but I'm definitely having fun grinding through it and plan on completing it and probably getting the DLCs to see what they add!",1660580011,1660580011,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

After about 3 attempts to get into this game it just blows me away how constantly the game gives zero F's about your time and just how cringe annoying this game really is.

At first glace the game seems sandboxy in the sense that you need X and to do or get that you could do A, B or C... But the B and C routes take hours and hours of grinding, where as A is almost no time at all... But to do route A you also need to get Y.  No problem, I like grinding things out I'll ju---NOPE. Plot twist: you can't actually grind it out anymore because now you need to do something else, let's call it Z, to un-road block your ability to grinding... okay well I'll just...

Do you see it yet? No? Let's keep going.

Now to get Z you'll just need to do D, E or F... easy peasy, but E and F again are mindless grinds for hours on end (that again are roadblocked by something else), and again you could just do D and not grind at all but D is actually locked behind T, U and V, which are locked behind Y... oh that's not so bad because we wanted to do Y anyway... so we'll just do T, U and V to get to Y but NOPE another plot twist... to do any of that you need to do something entirely different that totally doesn't (sarcasm, it does) go down the exact pattern again but from the beginning.

The amount of times that the game makes it seem like you have your choice only to then blindside and railroad you into the choice it seems to think you should go down is staggering.

On top of the above the game also has at least 5 more layers of progress slowing mechanics like real time spent forging, reputation systems, wealth systems, tool decay, a lot of inventory management and on and on and on.

I don't know if it's meant to pad out the games length or if its trying to be the worlds most annoying tutorial or something else, but I really dislike a lot of the design choices  made here.

Maybe at some point you overcome all of the blockers and get to at least make more of your own choices.. but I cannot seem to make it that far into the game even using guides or looking up exactly how to do something it seems to take hours and hours to get to a point where you aren't being forced down this tunnel of illusionary choices.

TLDR: I love the idea and look of the game and even the gameplay itself but constant roadblocks and unexplained arbitrary walls and dead ends to the player's progress make the whole package into something I utterly loathe.

Is there a dedicated wiki? Yes, but you WILL have certain aspects of the game spoiled for you if you use it, so. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Initially, the game is best described as ""walk around and fix things simulator"" but it's also not a game that hands you all of the things you need to be more efficient immediately. I personally find walking around with a ton of stone, fitch, nails, simple iron parts, and complex iron parts in my inventory the best thing to do early game because there're a ton of things to assemble or repair that require some or multiple of those ingredients. Is it slow? It can be, but there are items you can make or buy that make you move faster or allow you to teleport, so... yes and no? If you're not paying attention or checking out the vendors you can miss the little things that make the game easier for you. Gerry is an excellent tutorial skull, but even he isn't going to give you a solid outline of what to do.

The currency curve is brutal in the early game, and the days seem too short... but then you start getting the tools needed to make the game easier and then the days seem too long, expensive things are suddenly within reach, and the game seems to be almost too easy.... almost. Until there's something new added and the complexity increases and you're back to working hard on something. Is it for everyone? Oh, absolutely not. If you aren't learning how to make adequate use of your time or good at harvesting in excess, it's probably not the game for you, but if you're into that sort of thing and enjoy the way a difficult grind becomes easier with time, it might be.

Please be mindful that this is a review that focuses entirely on the gameplay of the base game itself; I do not include DLC or the story in my statements because I feel that there are certain aspects of either that could be better and a full dissection of the DLC I do have is a bit much for a general review.

The theme is medieval comedy, sort of Monty Python's the Holy Grail but more psychological and less funny.  Yes, there are morbid things in Graveyard Keeper like witch burning and corpse autopsy, but it's extremely tame, nothing as bad as a game like Diablo or most dungeon rogue-likes. GK has a much better story than Stardew V, the characters are more vivid, the writing is sharp.  There is a mystery to this world and your place in it, and the game doesn't ruin that mystery as it reveals secrets.  The NPCs all tend to be self-centered but they all have a chance for redemption towards the end of their stories.  My favorite thing about GK is how well the quests are written - they are all fetch-this/gather-10-of-that quests, but you forget completely because of the crazy yet human reasons the NPCs give you. It's all one big soup opera but with huge consequences for everyone.  Graveyard Keeper is almost perfect on the story/plot front.  

As a crafting game, it is a mixed bag with some improvements to Stardew Valley and some problems.  Similar systems include farming, fishing, brewing, crafting, dungeon crawling.  Farming doesn't require watering, so like most timed crafting, you simply start the thing and go do something else until finished.  The cycle is only 6 days long, not 4 seasons, so it's easy to come back to something you missed and the entire game is extremely forgiving.  

Crafting has a huge tech tree with tons of stations to build, including 4 farms to build, a mining quarry, alchemy lab, book writing, brewing house, kitchen etc. The game's title refers to a church that you manage, planting corpses in its grounds to grow into a super fancy cemetery. You perform autopsies on corpses (think opening an inventory screen and moving icons around) in order to make the corpses more holy and raise the value of the church.  This is also the most grinding, unsatisfying part of the game.  At least you can turn corpses into zombie helpers! DLC adds a tavern, refugee camp that acts as a long term pet to care for, and a steampunk lab for sending souls onto the after life.  Feel free to skip Better Save Soul, it's the worst written DLC and it's addition game systems are a bit of a drag. 

You will craft most items hundreds of times (or get zombie helpers to do it for you) so it rarely feels like your effort and hoarding addiction is punished.   

The world lacks a big open space for your farm/church, which means almost zero creativity in how you build your farm/church.  Every crafting station has a general area for you to build it in, and while you have some freedom to place stations in those areas, you will pretty much build the exact same station in the same place every time.  You will also do a lot of walking, so make sure to buy the teleportation stone from the village bar keep ASAP.  Inventory management is annoying, and I probably spend 1/3rd of my time just emptying my items into the right chests so inventory doesn't overwhelm me. There are some PC mods which fix this.  

These problems aside, Graveyard Keeper is a good game to follow up Stardew Valley is you are looking for more of the same but not the same super-sweet Disney feel to it.

There are a lot of resources to gather but huge chunks of the game are gated behind Faith, a resource that (as far as I could tell) you get once per week and in tiny doses. I found a lot of ways to maximize resource and money generation but if those levers exist from Faith I couldn't find them; even with the bonus Faith prayer, I could only get 9-10 per week. My entire economy ground to a halt as I sat around waiting for Faith to trickle in.

On top of that, the game does a very poor job at teaching its systems. I frequently gave up and just went to a wiki to figure out how to find certain things. The game has a tech tree that unlocks new things to build, but it doesn't tell you what those things do or what's required to make them until after you've unlocked them.

I desperately want to like this game. It has a great set of interlocking systems. But all of these systems just lead nowhere. One example: you spend a bunch of time and energy learning to create wine and distill booze to complete one quest, but after that the whole system is completely useless.

I feel that if you could create booze that granted boosts to your productivity or some meaningful addition to your base as a whole, it could really become integrated within your workflow, but after completing that one quest, it's just wasted space you gotta walk around.

Maybe the DLC fixes this issue by expanding on NPCs, quests, and crafting opportunities, but I just can't justify spending the money and time to find out.


--- Original review ---

TL;DR; The first 5 hours are incredible. The next 30 hours are a slog.

This game has a lot of care and the devs are super quick with updates so I have high hopes for this game in the future. As it stands in September of 2018, the end game feels VERY incomplete. There is a LOT of busy work in this game. If you've ever played Factorio and loathed the first few hours of running back and forth feeding materials into your various contraptions, that's the entirety of the end game. Lots of running out of material and then spending an entire day running around making things happen.

I kept hoping that the middle of the game was slow and it'd pick up toward the end, but unfortunately I'm near the end of the game and I just need to talk to one guy to advance the story and he just says ""OK come back next week"" and I have to spend a week twiddling my thumbs before talking to him again. This has happened 3 weeks in a row now.

I don't feel like this is some sinister plot to increase the play time of the game, but rather a misunderstanding of how some people play the game. I hope in the future there is more content in the game to wile away your time. There is definitely a LOT of opportunities for more content, but there is no promise of anything coming in the future.

If you like task-based games like Stardew, this might be the meditative game for you. But if you rather enjoy games where you advance a story by completing tasks you will find this one incredibly frustrating.",1537660352,1659713854,False,6,0,0.560193359851837158,0,True,False,False

At first I wasn't too keen on the NPCs at first..but after awhile their stories and characters grow on you. 

Ultimately though all of this is overshadowed by a poorly optimized and almost infuriating implementation of the games' core mechanics. For instance:

1. The day cycle. It's really unique and fun, but having characters only show up on certain days of the week? So if you happen to be busy with something else and miss them, guess what? You're screwed and have to wait another week-in game to for them appear again. Given how the main NPCs characters are ultimately paired and tied together, missing one NPC can actively block you on another NPCs quest. Thus more waiting and wasting your time.
2. Teleport Stone having limited points. The teleport stone has a great featuring of warping you to specific places. But often times, there were places I went to more often that I couldnt warp to. The Witches hut, the morgue, my vineyard, Witch Hill, etc. Thus the game just forces you to walk to those places...and once again wastes your time.
3. There's no explanation of core functions of the game. Having to look something up isn't a new thing in these life-sim farming based games...but like having to watch a tutorial video on the game prior to purchasing it just to understand what the heck is going on....a bit much imo. And even then I still made mistakes which ultimately punished me in not having certain items for crafting...making my journey that much more difficult and longer.

4. Finally there's the price on this game. Main game is 20 bucks plus the 3 separate DLCs being 10 bucks each. A total of 50 bucks for a game that is designed to waste my time? Effff that. 

My vote? Wait for the base game and DLC so go on a steam sale, you can pick everything up for 15 dollars. A much better deal. And look into getting mods on the base game before you play. They fix a lot of the quality of life issues that this game suffers from (running fast, auto fishing, thoughtful reminders, gerry's jumk truck, whereas my storage, all great mods!)

While the walk from your home in stardew valley to the town is 2 panels long, this game has more like 6 panels distance (of almost nothing), everything is stretched out, you'll be walking ..and walking ..and walking back and forth over n over.

There has to be SO FAR at least 20 different work stations? you build most of the parts at home and then take them cross country to another work station.. fingers crossed you remember recipes, there is no tracker, how many of one or more  of the 4 types of wood do you need? how many of the ..3 types of metal do you need..?, do you have the energy?

Reseached fruit trees, aw nope, ya can't plant fruit trees yet, you have to research something else first, to research something else so you can make another work bench so you can make something else, so you can buy a fruit tree, (literally)  research IS A MESS. not to mention i researched large tree cutting so i could clear my fruit tree area first...
and then the game only allows you to place objects where they tell you you can.

oh and to research those things require 3 different 'points' gained by ..research and 2 different actions...
The game is the opposite of intuitive.
From what i've read there is no ability to fast travel.
ive requested a refund, going to play stardew to get my fix i think, i might get this game when it goes to the bargain bin (not getting a refund, it took to long to see how much of a shit show the game is, save your money)

Most common negativity of this game is the walking, well there's a teleport stone that uses to be a one time use back when the game was new, there's also the underground tunnel that will greatly decrease travel time. The DLC's are kinda pricy and they even tell you in the description how much more will be added to the game even how much more hours to put into it. It's a relaxing game full of references. With the amount of time I put into this game I still haven't beaten it. Now the grind of the game is a lot at the start, but once you get zombies and if you have the Better Save Soul DLC it honestly becomes pretty straight forward. You don't need the DLC's but if you want to get all the achievements and special upgrades then you will probably need to consider it, also this game works way better with controller. Now the base price of the game is honestly fair, if you want to get the DLC's wait for a sale to come up it will be worth it. Honestly this is one of many games I own that I can always get into playing without a thought of hesitation. It has amazing graphics that doesn't require a super computer to run even the screenshots don't show the full aspect of how good looking it is, a nice story that isn't all over the place, and overall a relaxing game.

The DLC for this game is super overpriced... I was looking forward to completing more achievements, but I'm not willing to spend the $10 per DLC pack for 6-12 hours of extra game play. It's a shame because, the game would have felt more put together with their DLC packs.

But, for me at least, the trouble's worth it because the setting and idea behind it are darn fun. It's really relaxing when I'm not trying to keep track of everything so much that I'd be at top efficiency and just roll with it instead.

Edit: The DLCs aren't, however, worth the full price in my eyes. Make sure to grab them on sale if you enjoy the game because they generally add a decent amount of playtime with new quests and mechanics.

[b]Mild con - WRITING [/b] Yeah, this too. The main story? It, uh, exists? Barely. Any character besides the annoying donkey has the depth and interest of a log. And they're annoying.

Graveyard Keeper is a fun game in essence. It took a formula that worked, and made a cute game with a morbid, fun story with it.

Pros:
-Lots of things you can do from Farming to Combat to Fishing
-NPC story lines seem interesting and some of the NPCs are really funny and witty.

Cons:
-Quest lines are weirdly paced
-Weekly cycle while interesting is making the progression of questlines not hard but straight up annoying
-Crafting is tedious and gets boring quick
-Lack of any sort of inventory management system, even bigger chests would be nice. I cant even build an additional chest in my house to store food items!
-Walking... Its about 70% of what you do in this game, and without any sort of mount/sprint function, its long, tedious and boring.
-A lot of the systems in the game feel.. ""low-effort"", like the fishing system that is not only ripped straight from Stardew Valley, but the fish act 1:1 the same every time. There's not even slight variance in their movements, its always exactly the same.
-Progression without any real.. progress? I made improved tools and it didnt feel any different afterwards, everything still took a lot of Stamina to make, and a lot of time on top of that.


All in all, the game feels like its trying to waste your time at any moment. Trying to get to the Witch's Hut in the Swamp to the West? You better walk a long way that loops aaaaaaall around the swamp. You can then find a way to make a bridge, but you didnt know that! So you better walk aaaaaaall the way back to grab the material. Hmmmm.. Was it flitches or planks I needed... There's no way for me to look it up, unless I literally wrote it down on a note IRL. I'm sure it was Planks! Nope, flitches, gotta go back again...

Then the quest progression just feels weird.. Literally the first thing you're told to do is: Get some Meat and sell it at the tavern. Whats that? He cant buy it from you without a stamp. Sure thing, how do I get a Stamp? Well there's this one guy that might give you one, Miss xyz might be able to tell you where to find him. You talk to her, it opens up another questline, where you need to bring the bard paper and it goes on and on.. Your second quest is bringing someone Wine, and how to get Wine? Its a decently late technology. The pacing just feels off, and it feels extremely drawn out. After 12 hours of playtime I have the theoretical means to finally get the stamp, but I either need to fight my way through the dungeon, which is honestly extremely unfun, or save up a lot of money to buy one. It just feels drawn out for the sake of it.

I'm usually a fan of grindy games, but this one is just grindy in all the wrong ways. It's actively trying to waste your time and draw out the progression, or atleast feels that way.",1657355081,1657355081,False,85,1,0.815075516700744629,0,True,False,False

You play as a regular guy who somehow gets teleported to the historically inaccurate medieval age where you are tasked with the job as a graveyard keeper. Your job description includes (but is not limited to):

* Managing the graveyard
* Holding sermons for the town's people
* Prepare corpses before burial
* Realizing you can profit of dead people
* Suddenly you sell meat as a side business
* F*ck morals all together, it is time for some questionable alchemy

PROS: The game-play is very much like Stardew Valley, but has sort of a learning curve due to it having a bit more going on in the mechanics. The setting is a nice change of pace compared to other games in it's genre and the self aware humor of the characters is refreshing, the dialogue is snappy and well written!

CONS: I'm about half way through the game and have put 40 hours into it, so it's very grindy. As much as I hate to say it, the base game leaves a lot to be desired especially when it comes to the story line. I think the one major cons of the game is that part of the MAIN story is behind a paywall and is being marketed as a DLC; which is pretty crazy due to this being a $20 game when it's not on sale and the """"DLCs"""" being $6-10. On top of that, the base game is definitely built around the DLCs, so if there's a gap in the story or game mechanics it's because you didn't buy them. Also, a tiny complaint is that you have to play as the keeper as a dude, which I know is a deal breaker for some who are more inclined to play feminine characters or want customization options. 

Bottom line: Buy this game and the stranger sins DLC when it's on sale because then you'll get the full story line and it will be completely worth it",1656829427,1657134688,True,1,0,0.507874011993408203,0,True,False,False

Great artwork, catchy music, good writing in an interesting setting, and neat little personalized speech samples for every NPC. Excellent controller support. The base-building stuff is pretty simple, and doesn't give you much room for customization.

Workshop would be nice, but probably not happening. I say it would be nice, because mods easily fix the biggest problem I had with this game, and many other games like it: a tedious and unnecessary inventory system. So much of the game was spent running from one end of my yard to the other, hunting for the chest with the stuff I need. When I'm doing this, I'm not engaged. I'm not interacting with anything new. I'm just scrolling through an inventory window or holding the stick down for 20 seconds while my guy runs across the same area for the 100th time, to fetch some boards or nails or whatever. That's not the fun part of the game.

So I eventually installed a mod that expanded inventory size, eliminated stack limitations and pulled resources from any of my containers for crafting or building. This solved some major hiccups in the flow of the game. I still had to pick the item up and take it with me if an NPC needed it for a quest, which is fine, but I spent less time doing needless busywork. If you get this game, I highly recommend looking into modding it right away, so you don't waste your time like I did.

I got all the DLCs. Stranger Sins was good. If you're interested in the lore of this setting, definitely pick it up. But I can not recommend the other two: Better Save Soul and Game of Crones. They add some interesting features, but they also use time and resource-gating mechanics that just seem to get in the way of any storytelling they're trying to do.

I enjoyed the relaxed pace of this game, there's no deadlines you have to meet, you don't have a bedtime and you won't suddenly pass out because it's 2 AM, you could go hard and finish the story ASAP or you can chill and do whatever you please.

The NPC characters are funny and interesting, their stories cross paths in surprising ways. This game is not like Stardew in which you are meant to socialise with these characters outside of the story or romance them. And also, the main character is not a blank slate for you to self-insert with or make your own. MC is his own person, with a full personality and his own backstory.

Some draw backs this game has is that it can be a bit grindy, there was definitely a point in my play through where I felt like I was in a slog but once I unlocked the automated system my progress picked right back up again.

this was also before any dlc was released.


all i wanted from this world was to be friends with zombies, the undead.
i knew that it would become a painfully tedious process to overcome with so many spirits merged at my feet.

if you've ever seen those people in media that are corpse grinders, they live with the dead people...
a mortician, the coroner, a graveyard digger or keeper or anything related to handling bodies of the dead after life
this is you.  your only real friends are dead or illusionary dreams.

a mortuary of lost souls passing through your fastidious hands, i explored all opportunity to make my new nightmare
so we pass through our daily routines: get corpse, bury corpse, improve life, rush to the industry, sleep.
finally we achieve embalmed friends that are little more than brainless muscle which lumber through our mind...
having more time to spend lazily fishing while the green-ones are pouring their eyes out on a repetitive and dull task.

the involvement of any kind of narrative story is mostly a moot digression from our true goals: wealth from death.

I bought this game during covid and planned to play casually, in parallel with my gf... but the game is too slow and time consuming. My gf gave up due to lack of tips in the game (nor internet) but i tried to move on. 

Heres what i appreciate about the game
- Nice concept. Dark humour.
- Variety of stuff to do from butchering corpse to get ingredients to farming to alchemy and etc.
- Nice Characters Developemtns
- Variety of items

and heres the cons...
- Character development is too slow. You need to spend points to level up your skill trees. You spent your points wrongly and you are f*cked. You have no ideas how to get the items/where is the work bench for it, you are f*cked.
- Characters is too f*cking slow. You need to walk from your house to the lighthouse (a place in the game) and ITS FRICKING FAR. I only know that there is a teleport stone that is reusuable later. and EVEN WITH THAT, you still need to walk alot in the game. The only idea i know how to solve this is by crafting the spped potion. I looked it up on internet, found all the ingredient, spent my last blue points to learn how to craft the work bench, ONLY TO KNOW LATER THAT YOU NEED ANOTHER TECH TO CRAFT THIS WORK BENCH. And this alr 30 hrs of playing, i only got to the mid tier.
- the routes to get solve the quest is complex. You need to get that items, you need to find that person. AND YOU DONT EVEN KNOW WHERE AND THAT PERSON IS. You would only know what to do if you done the other quests to know who this person is.

The internet has been a big help... but im done with this sh*t. im done with all the quests im done with finding all the limited resources and slownees in this game.",1656500606,1656500606,False,2,0,0.454016298055648804,0,True,False,False

Every aspect of it is complete tedium and a major grind, with constant stutter and an unstable framerate that gets worse as you progress further into the game.  Even with a 2080 SUPER and 9900k in my system, after over 30 hours into the game, just forcing myself to try and complete it, the framerate eventually managed to even drop down to 58fps in an area.  However, when I first started the game, it originally maintained a steady, albeit stuttery, locked framerate of 170fps, matching the refresh rate of my monitor.

Turning v-sync on even made the stutter issue far worse while reducing the framerate even further, but this is made all the worse when just moving around causes your character to bounce between 2 positions by approximately the width of an in-game pixel, wherein an in-game pixel is the equivalent of the game's art's pixel size while displayed at whatever resolution you're running.  That motion occurs at a pace which seems to be tied to the framerate, thus it's less frequent with a lower framerate than with a higher framerate.

Just to properly scale the thing so I could monitor the frame latency and my system information with MSI Afterburner's overlay at the correct size, I had to switch the game to fullscreen mode so I could set the game to a 2560x1440 resolution, which is my system's native resolution, then back to borderless window mode to deal with its scaling issue.  The game has NO function to scale anything, so the higher the resolution you go, the smaller everything will appear as more of the game is then displayed on the screen.  I find it necessary to switch the game's resolution to 1600x900, after the aforementioned fullscreen mode adjustment, in borderless window mode to rescale the game to a size that's actually playable on my 27-inch monitor.  Despite the adjustments to the resolution, the skill trees will display information which is just cut off when below a 2560x1440 resolution, so much so that half of the text of a skill will be off screen with no way to read it without changing the game's resolution.

For whatever reason, the game barely does anything with my GPU for processing, but pegs my CPU in such a way that it'll go to around 25% utilization, leaving my GPU at 5% utilization.  I suspect the issue with the stuttering and abysmal framerate in areas with multiple objects you can interact with, such as plants you will be required to grow, is directly tied to their utter failure to program the game in such a way that it actually uses what a game should be using for its visuals: the GPU.

All of this, and I haven't even started on the gameplay!

Even just 20 minutes into the game, I was already regretting the purchase, due to the tedium and overcomplicated nature of the systems involved just to finish certain tasks and unlock hidden skills and recipes.  This game is a CHORE to play.  I meant it when I said I was forcing myself to play it, but here at 38.6 hours of play time, according to Steam at the time of this review, I haven't yet finished it because there's just so much padding.  Certain NPCs in the game require interaction and tasks to be completed in order to progress through the game, but those NPCs are only available during a single day in a 6-day week the game has to offer.  It can easily take an hour just to get the time back around to those NPCs so you can further your tasks with them, if you're attempting to make the best use of your time by grinding away your skills.

That grind is absolutely required, too, for the skills you unlock require a tremendous amount of meaningless tasks to be repeated for absolutely no reason, just so you can obtain an abysmal amount of points to allocate to said skills in order to progress them.  For example, collecting blue points: let's say you're unlocking a skill which has a 100 blue point requirement, ignoring the red and green points it may also require to unlock.  The best option I found to gain blue points, being the most accessible that wasn't wasteful because of the ease of collecting materials to do so, was to create several ""Stone Grave Fence II"" at the stone cutter.  How many, exactly?  Well, each one gave 5 blue points, so that's a total of 20, which doesn't seem so bad.

Unfortunately, to get that 20, you first have to collect a large amount of stone, then polish some.  After which, you can then only make about 7 before your character is out of energy, so you then sleep, and wait... and wait... and wait... while you watch your character sleep... every... single... time.  I don't know why it makes you watch your character sleep, but it's a good 30 seconds or so every single time you make your character sleep, and they will require sleep every 2-3 days, otherwise your energy will constantly drain.  If your energy is at 0, you can't do any tasks.  You could raise your energy with food items, but that's incredibly wasteful and ultimately would take far more time to do than just sleeping, especially given how close the bed in your house is to where you can place the stone cutter.

So, to get those 20 grave fences made, you have to create about 7, sleep, then repeat until 20.  Or, what I ended up doing because it meant creating fewer polished stones, break down those fences you make to get back just the polished stones, not the other stones required to make it.  With that, you then create 7 fences, sleep, break down 5, sleep, break down 2, create a few fences, sleep, then repeat with however many fences you can before running out of energy, only to then sleep so you can break them down.

That's tedium, and though it may only take 20 of those fences for 100 points, THAT'S IN A SINGLE SKILL.  In my time playing, I've used something around or over 2,000 blue points.  Sure, there's some single-use things you can do to obtain a large amount of points, but that's single-use.  Almost all the items you can use on the study give red or green points, so grinding for blue is effectively required.  Creating notes or books is more inefficient than the fences I was making, given that they give approximately the same number of blue points, but require materials which are less common to obtain and thus take far longer to obtain.

Away from the points on the skills and the issues with scaling and resolution, since there's far more which can be said about those, but this review is already exceedingly long.  The hit detection of your sword is also abysmal, and upgrading it or adding new skills to your combat ability does absolutely nothing to help fix the issue.  The way enemies attack is completely broken for such basic means of combat, with bats that'll charge at you so fast you have to dodge when you see them charging up for their attack, or you'll just get hit.  If you do get hit, those bats will repeat their attacks, without a single pause.  If you dodge, those bats will have a short pause, giving you just enough time to land a single blow on them before they then continue their attack.

Other enemies have similar issues of charging in for an attack, leaving very little window for you to return attack, and one I came across will even cause massive frame latency spikes every single time it attacks while attacking 3 times in a row before a short pause.  Your only way to attack is a basic, horizontal slash, even after you max out your combat tree, as I did.  The skill which says you'll look cool and have increased damage at the end of that skill tree?  Yeah, it's completely misleading, as all you get is a boost to your damage, with nothing special being added to it.

It seems I've now also hit the limit of Steam's character count on reviews, so I can't continue explaining the game's issues.  Trust me, though, there's A LOT more wrong with it than what I've mentioned.  Don't waste your money on this.

I want to like this game, but it's work, pure and simple. Soon as I got off of vacation I couldn't play this anymore. If you're the sort of person that enjoys the feeling of nose to the grindstone, by all means, I recommend it! But I personally don't like to come home from work to go to work on a game.

As a whole it feels unbalanced. At times I felt like this was meant to be a mobile game with the amount of extra button presses just to do one task!

Graveyard Keeper is not a very unique game or premise; you die, you resurrect in a new mysterious medieval world with magic, and you have to find your way home to your love. This is the main characters story, and you are just helping him get there. The game is not easy to get into, with many tasks being impossible in the beginning if you use them wrong. I had to start a new save file and consult a game guide to even begin properly. There is basically no tutorial, and I've relied on the wiki my entire playthrough, which isn't a big deal if you play other games like Stardew Valley, where it's common, but can be annoying to a lot of players. I don't have any of the DLC, but it annoyingly takes up space on the main loading screen. The EXP system can also be very obnoxious because of how much you need to grind to unlock something. It's difficult to keep track of quests, I didn't even know they were pinned to characters' profiles in the menu, but the pins are very vague. It takes 20 steps to complete a quest that was presented as no big deal, with minimal reward. I have no idea how fishing works. A lot of materials are very grindy, and even when you get further in with zombie slaves, it takes forever for them to transport the materials. You also can't enter ""The Town"", which is a huge set piece in the story line, but was never implemented and most likely never will be. The unlockable dungeon, which is a huge part for most games, can practically go completely ignored, and as there are no repercussions for dying, I find myself just dying multiple times in a level due to powerful mobs and just kinda.. walking back in. That's it.

Now, the reason why I recommend Graveyard Keeper. For a pixelized art style, it is very easy on the eyes. I find pixel art to be difficult to do well in a game, with a game being too bright or just too busy to be very common with the style. Graveyard Keeper is very visually appealing, and objects are easily identifiable. The storyline kinda takes the backseat in my playthrough, while I do work to finish the game, there's really no big rush for it. Taking the time I need to upgrade my tools and graveyard are pretty therapeutic. The overall ridiculousness of the game is nice to play in as well, where the village is named The Village and the world is canonically flat, the simple minded NPC's are basically useless aside from quests, so you hardly have to grind reputation, and you can even just sell items to level up the merchants. Day and night cycles don't matter, so you can always move at your own pace. Crafting can be interesting, although you have to consult the wiki, making multiple things that will eventually turn into your goal is nice sometimes. My favorite part about this game is the soundtrack, although I've been listening to it through speakers for 24 hours, putting headphones on made it feel like a whole new soundtrack. Very nice and fitting for the game.

Overall, the game has plenty of play time, is pleasing to look at, listen too, and progress through, but has the drawback of a boring story, minimal world building, and is confusing for beginners. I'd recommend the purchase if it's on sale.

POST ENDING EDIT:
Damn,, I spent all that time grinding out materials for an ending like that? It was nice how everyone's story intertwined but I am sorely dissapointed in the ending. Would not reccommend unless you have 50 hours to spend just grinding out materials slowly or if you have some sort of interest in the DLC, which I will not be purchasing.",1647212707,1653716536,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There is so much to do in this game, even more if you have all DLCs (which you absolutely should). You have constant pressure to do something, so many different quests and projects that you want to work on, it's hard to turn off the game sometimes. Good thing is, the more you do, the more you can automate (with a DLC) So things get easier and you can turn your attention to other projects. The stories, humor and the references to other Games/ Movies/ TV Shows are really great. It took me around 50h to complete the game and all DLCs, but not all achievements, though.

The only ""negatives"" are that many different stories are not really completed and are more open ended. Maybe they will be ended by another DLC. Also a lot of stuff you have to do is bound to specific days in the week. Which means that if you ignore certain story elements in the beginning, you have a lot waiting to do in the end. There are ways to speed up time and there is always something else you could do, but sometimes it's annoying when you speak with an NPC, do something for him and have to return to him, but you have to wait a whole week until you can continue the quest.

Firstly, the good: it has a fun gameplay loop at first. The artstyle is cute and the music is nice, but that's it really. The gameplay loop REALLY starts losing goals a few hours in. It's frustrating how this game is designed to purposefully overwhelm you. Before you can do a seemingly simple task to accomplish a quest you don't even know why you want to finish, there's like 7 steps you need to take, none of which the game hints at. The quests start becoming very numerous and you always have no idea what to do first because you don't know how close you are to accomplishing anything. You're completely lost without a guide. 

The map is also HUGE for absolutely no reason and you have no way of moving faster, even though the first thing you see in the promotional art is YOUR CHARACTER RIDING A DONKEY! The donkey's only purpose is to bring you corpses, and eventually, you lose sight of why you're even paying him to do it since you have no major reason to ""Graveyard Keep"" at first (other than money, but there are tons more better ways to make it).

Don't even get me started on the energy meter, my GOD! It is without a doubt the thing I hate most about the game. You walk out into your work area and craft like, 4 iron parts, and your guy has to go to sleep again. You keep going back and forth and it gets old really quickly. You can cook food to restore energy, but at first all you can cook restores a very small amount of energy that you might as well just go to sleep.

Those are my main major gripes with the game, but I have a couple more personal ones, like the characters and the ""humor"" for example. The characters in this game are extremely bland and boring and they all basically are tired and annoyed all the time. The game isn't light hearted at all either and takes on pretty dark themes, seemingly for humor purposes? I really don't get it, it always felt really strange to me. Also, for some reason, you cannot customize your character whatsoever even though he has as little ties to the story as possible. Not a big deal, but definitely worth mentioning.

I honestly really really want to love this game, and I've really tried, but playing it just gives me a headache.
I *love* grinding, but this game just makes it feel awful due to a massively overly complicated crafting and upgrade system and extremely punishing early game. So little is explained and if you make a mistake in the beginning, you will pay for it for many many hours.
It comes down to a feeling of the game being wildly unbalanced and almost unfinished. It really lacks in quality of life mechanics (it feels similar to some of the first Harvest Moon games, for reference) and it is just so frustrating to play as a culmination of all the problems I list below.  

- The crafting system is massively over complicated and clunky. There are just way too many ingredients associated with the main resources. Also the queuing system is great in theory, but you can't change the order of anything in your queue, which leaves you with a loooot of clicking to do any time you want to change the order.

- The story is somewhat minimal, or at least you have to grind for so long before you unlock any more of it that development feels few and far between. The characters you do meet are unlikeable and lack depth for the most part. I think it lacks a lot of free will in the sense that you are working towards a set goal (returning to the living) with a set character.

- Buying/selling is just.... ugh. You end up with so much stuff that you have to destroy because you can't sell it (destroying it takes fucking forever as well as you have to do it item by item), so you end up resenting most of the creation processes such as farming because there's very little point to them.

- The movement speed. Sweet jesus it takes all day to go to the lighthouse and back. It takes so long to get to places, you find yourself avoiding certain quest lines because you know you're just going to spend all your time walking to the NPC. This combined with the extremely short day length is just brutal.

- The combat is awful, movement is slow and clunky and it makes it almost impossible not to take damage.

- Honestly the game is still pretty buggy and doesn't run very well, I get a lot of animations that don't trigger properly and the screen often jitters when I walk. Usually I don't really care about this stuff but when I paid £30, I expected it to be at least somewhat polished.",1651274404,1651274404,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

it feels like they initially made this into a mobile game with microtransactions, but forgot to remove the ridiculous timers. everything also seems built to not only waste your time, but the characters time. everything has a timer when it should be nearly instant: crafting things, skipping days, research. these are not passive most of the time as well, you have to personally spend 5 seconds chopping a log, then splitting it, and then adding the fixtures with nails that also took 5 seconds to craft. it is needlessly mind numbing.

 one of the worst parts of the game has to be research especially, where in order to gain research points you need to host an event on a specific day of the week. most other games you could simply skip the day 6 times in a row in order to grind it out. this game? no way! you have to do something every day, as you only sleep until your energy is depleted, so you have to find stupid stuff to do until either: 1. you waste 6 days worth of energy or 2. you build a structure that lets you just timeskip after researching enough. 

but oh, surely mods might help? no. a lot of the mods for this game are either no longer supported for the current update, or are unavailable, especially the QoL ones. 

like i said before, if your favorite part of mobile games is watching the timers tick down, this is the game for you. if you like a grind, possibility like OSRS, this game also might be for you. if you want something to actively engage you while being a grind, I would strongly not recommend it.",1651110185,1651110185,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I loved the premise of a dark humor sort of body harvester/grave keeping business, but that is basically only 2% of the game play.

Others have already stated much more eloquently, but this game is an extremely obnoxious grind. You receive a task from NPC A who makes you talk to NPC B, who asks for Item A, but to get item A, you need to talk to NPC C, but to talk to NPC C, you need to craft Item B, but that needs ingredients that make you have to craft a machine for EACH AND EVERY COMPONENT, and even when you finish that, the NPC C then tells you you need to talk to a different NPC bc they don't have what you need.

It's overall just an extremely frustrating experience. The slow walking speed, lack of mounts or charming NPCs, lack of character customization, lack of FARM customization, and overall lack of just... basic, streamlined tasks, it's irritating. I am confused as to how this game was so highly recommended.

I tried, I really tried to enjoy this game but I can't, not anymore. Initially I was captivated by the atmosphere and the premise. The crafting system and technology tree seemed overwhelming initially but as I began I started to understand how it worked and I was having fun exploring the progression.

That fun died pretty quickly. The issue is how the entire thing feels like one big grind that has no respect for your time. There are dozens of crafting tables to research and build and it often ends up that in order to build the one thing you need to get the component you need you will need to research and build several other items.

This is especially irritating when you need something for a quest.

An example. Very early on I got a quest that requires me to make and deliver 10 flyers. The flyers are made an a particular crafting table that you need to research and build. However to make the flyers I need and ink and quill, which are made at a different crafting table. In order to make an ink and quill I need ink, which is made at a different crafting table which needs to be researched and built. In order to make that ink I needed to get components made at a different crafting table which i needed to research and build. 

So this example was the straw that broke the camels back for me however there were other issues;
1. The inventory space cannot be upgraded (as far as I can tell), this gives you 20 slots at the start and these can very quickly fill up unless you are completely commiting yourself to one task at a time. I tried to be efficient, thinking of what tasks I needed to do and taking what i needed so I could kill two birds with one stone. But the small inventory space often made this difficult.

2. The character moves too slow. So the character's walking speed wouldnt be so bad on its own however everything feels so far away. Some of the materials you collect include stone, iron and coal. You can collect these from small deposits or eventually unlock the mountains where you can collect large blocks that can be broken down into several smaller ones back at you house. The issue is the mountains are a fair trek away causing you to lose most of the day getting back and on top of that you can only bring one block back at a time. You can unlock short cuts but these honestly didnt help much. 

3. The energy bar drains quickly. From what Ive read it doesnt seem like the energy bar can be increased which means youll find it empties right in the middle of some project. Later in the game winemaking apparantly mitigates this and food can help earlier on but it can be a grind to get there and thats just one less inventory space.

4. The zombies felt useless. OK so minor spoilers eventually you unlock a means to create zombie workers to carry out tasks. After doing this I honestly felt I wasted my time. They didnt seem that helpful and with the mining ones in particular I honestly felt mining one block at a time and trudging it back home myself was quicker. 

Ultimately the game felt like I was just doing one big chore. The grave yard keeping became such a minor point to it I honestly forgot half the time when new corpses were delivered because I was too busy spending half the day and my energy getting resources. The fact that I felt like I was wasting time wasnt an issue in game as there really isnt a time limit to anything, the days only really define which NPCs are around and when you need to perform a sermon. But I felt like I was wasting my own time. The game just became such a tedious amount of busy work of trying to make one item but having to grind research points to make two new crafting tables just to find out I needed another table to make the components for those tables. 

It very well may be the case that once you have all the crafting tables built and your own zombie workforce going it all becomes smooth sailing. But the two questions it raises for me is; 1. What will be left after that? and 2.Will it be fun getting there. For me the first one made me feel that the entire game was just about crafting one thing to get to the next thing, padding to fill out what would otherwise be a relatively short game. And for question two that had already been answered, I wasn't having fun and I wasn't prepared to sit through hours of tedious grinding I the hope I would later.

Often times when games attempt this direction they come off as horribly edgy and hard to sit through, or push it too far and just feel uncomfortable. And while this game does have uncomfortable aspects, they manage to balance this dark tone with humor and charm that make it a great time to get absorbed into. Like the many greats of the genre, this is a game that can suck away your time without you even realising it, farming crops is a simple but effective gameplay loop that many games have done before, and its done well here, but the focus is on the graveyard and the many services around it. Maintaining the graveyard and managing corpses is a morbid but strangely enjoyable mechanic, and while the combat is very barebones, dungeon crawling is always a good time. The one big complaint I have is simply that the game isn't quite done yet. A lot of NPCs feel useless or at very incomplete, and there were a couple times where things I were working on kinda stopped half way since I had no means to continue.

Listed below are some likes/dislikes.  The ending was just OK.  This game is more about the journey of learning and unlocking everything.  There are DLC but I'm not planning on playing any of them.

Things I liked:
-  The three color experience points system where you use those to unlock technologies in the various tech trees.  Working to unlock these kept me invested in the game.  I also liked the study desk where you could study most items to get some of the color points.
- The systems for managing bodies and also increasing your graveyard/church score.  I liked that you could eventually control whether more bodies would show up.
- Zombie workers was a cool idea and I definitely used some but not as many as the game might have encouraged.
- The six day week where you can rest whenever you are ready.
- Game length.  It took me 55 hours to reach the credits of the base game and this felt about right to me.  I had finished most of the tech trees by then and there was less to do.

Things I disliked:
- Fishing.  Thankfully I was able to buy most of the fish related things I needed for quests.
- I would have preferred that the game be more open about alchemy recipes and the effects of removing body parts so you don't have to check a Wiki.
- If you don't balance completing quests for people then at the end of the game you may be waiting week after week for one quest line to progress.  I was waiting on the astrologer at the end.
- I was losing interest in the game by around 50 hours and wished there had been more goals to keep me invested.  For example, I would have liked trying to reach another tier for the graveyard.",1649629989,1649629989,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My previous review was no, but I got invested so swapped to yes.

-Energy depletes after doing relatively little

-Re the above point, they give you a teleportation item that lets you fast travel to and from the town/other important landmarks but which feels like they knew the walking distance was a problem? and didn't really even fix it? 
-Progression is painstakingly slow, hindered by the fact certain essential NPCs will only show up once a week for some reason? 
-No actual variation in how you approach the gravekeeping, there's a whole intricate set of skill trees but your actual graveyard is always going to look about the same regardless

The artwork is good enough to paint the picture of being a graveyard keeper and there is plently of stuff to do in this game and there is many areas to explore. The problem is that the game lacks a sense of direction and how very frustrating this game is. It has not many tutorials to teach you how to stuff. Npcs give very little details on how you get certain items in the game such as maggots. Who would know that shit comes from a random chance of harvesting plants. Here i was looking for it on the map when all i had to do was farm which had 0 tutorial on how to do it. 

When you do manage to finish the enourmous grind some quests have, the rewards and dialogues from quests feel very underwhelming and are an insignificant task amongst the many you have to complete. The first dlc with positive reviews can help make the dialogue more rewarding but it shouldnt have to cost more money for content that should already be in there to make the game fun. The friendship points with Npcs are never at max and they do not need to be to finish the game, makes the game feel unfinished and empty with the depth of characters and the players connection with them.

The amount of time i spent trying to figure how to get research points and realizing what each thing needs could have helped speed up my actions and that zombies would be such a big help and something that would make life so much easier could have easily saved me 10 hours that I spent because I did not want to use the wiki as a good game should not have the need for the player to rely on that to progress.

The underwhelming rewards for your actions, the fact that this game is only enjoyable using the wiki and with friendship points that you never need to fully max out to get the ending, clearly shows this game is unfinished and is not something I can recommend unless you enjoy the tedious grind of quests that makes each action feel so miniscule in regards of progressing or if you have no problems jumping through loops wiking every 5 minutes to understand what to do.

edit: After a year and a half of contemplation, I can now articulate what I found so specifically dissatisfying about this game: If to live is to suffer, then to some extent we must find meaning within that misery. What this game lacks, after 156 hours of gameplay, is something beyond misery. Instead, it's a long process of toil, which would be satisfying if there was any sort of emotional pay off or ways to create enjoyment out of that process. Instead, it's a tedious process with none of the ways a real person in this situation would find to alleviate that misery.

Considering I almost eclipsed 170 hours into this game I  will say it was extremely enjoyable well spent time.
The game has a fairly straight forward story with your goal is to make it back home to your real world after you died in a fatal car accident,
If you enjoy Stardew Valley type building games then this game is pretty much on the exact same level where you will be doing tasks and quests for many of the townsfolk to accomplish your next steps toward getting closer to getting back home.
Along with farming for food,cooking,crafting and making alchemy potions you will also be in charge of a graveyard which you will need to build up a few levels and that task will take some time but you will also be the undertaker and you will be performimg autopsies on dead bodies removing parts which you will need later in the game and you will also be responsible for burying the bodies in the graveyard which will give you points depending on quality of the autopsied body and the quality headstones and fencing you surround the grave with,
There are tons of craftings and building you will be doing as well as selling foods and veggies along with wines,beers and other alcahol you are able to craft in your basement.
The game can become very grindy at times and you WILL find yourself backtracking many many times but that adds to the enjoyment and mystery of the game which also builds the desire to accomplish most tasks.
There are mines you can explore that like Stardew Valley has monsters and creatures guarding the treasures in which case you will need to kill in order to advance further into the mines,
Like Stardew Valley there are plenty of fishing areas as well with plenty of different fish types to catch and the fishing is much easier in Graveyard Keeper then Stardew,
Overall the game is very enjoyable with no time limits on tasks which allow the player to simply play at their own pace and accomplish everything at their own pace,
I was a little disheartened when I finally reached the end of the game and I went back to my wife and my life as there were still plenty of things to do in the game had I chose to but I simply felt no reason to as I already completed the main quest of the game which is to successfully be the graveyard keeper and complete all requests until the portal back home was able to be used,
There are DLCs which would allow the player to play longer and build tavern and resturant and it offers many more quests and tasks offered by townsfolk and much more money to be made as well as building the graveyard and church up but like mentioned I felt no reason to continue once I made it back home to my real life.
Also I should add that if the DLCs are not used at the beginning of the game it really makes not much sense to play them after the end of the game as you already accomplished much of what is needed for some of the early DLC requirements and your not really going to get the benefit of the complete DLC if you use them after endgame!!!

Overall Graveyard Keeper is a fantastic game that you can easily lose yourself with and play for hours on end and enjoy the satisfaction of completing quests and opening new areas of the map.
The crafting and building aspect of the game will keep you quite occupied as your trying to figure out how to create many items as the game really leaves you out by yourself to figure everything out which really adds to the game,
I need to mention that there are probably over 75 different alchemy potions that you can figure out how to make and use as well as embalming solutions and through the game from start to finish I only crafted about 6 different potions and zero embalming solutions as I never needed any of them to make it to the endgame but they are there to help aid the player get things done faster and easier,
In addition to potions and embalming solutions you can craft lots of different fertilizers for your farming to help you grow better quality crops but I NEVER needed any of those either as I simply chose to buy the highest grade crop seeds and simply grew the best crops,
As for the mines?
There is no real need to go into them and not any quests that need to have you in the mines and if you do go into the mines you will find many potions,crop seeds and precious metals that are needed to make tools and other items needed and though they will help you in the form of you not needing to craft these items theres no real reason to have to go into the mines outside of just wanting to enjoy the fun of battling monsters and searching around.

I have nearly 170 hours into the game and I took my time and figured about 85% of everything out myself which took extra time naturally but there are WIKIs and walkthroughs that can help players get  through rough times if they choose to use them but half the fun of games like these are figuring everything out for yourself as the feeling is much more greater once you do!!!

If you enjoy a nice peaceful adventure game that includes crafting,building,cooking and farming with some fighting and hunting then Graveyard Keeper will keep you occupied for many many hours and you will ABSOLUTELY enjoy 99% of your time invested with that lonely 1% of time making you a little poed because you need to backtrack a few times.

If you purchase Graveyard Keeper and you have the DLCs too then by all means play the full game with all DLCs from the beginning for the best results as like mentioned I seen not much reason to play any further once I made it to the endgame.",1647645648,1647645648,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are a few things that keep it from being a great (or possible even good) game, IMO.

-Initial machine setup is very difficult, you will often find yourself stuck in a loop of tasks that you can't complete because every part depends on each other. Definitely doable with help from the wiki and a few online guides, but it is frustrating.

-The game was clearly released unfinished, there are tons of characters that are labeled with friendship points as though you're supposed to level them up, but you end up never needing to speak to them at all and their friendship points remain at 0.

-Middle of the game is a straight repetitive grind, there's a point where you have to get something like 12gold and it takes a few in-game weeks of repetitive and boring tasks to achieve. I nearly uninstalled in the middle of this quest.

-It's most major flaw, though, is the endgame. I was not actually able to finish the game, I don't know if it glitched out or what, but there was a point where I had completed all but 1 of the quests, but none of the NPCs who were supposed to have dialogue to trigger the last quest had the appropriate dialogue. I spent about 2 in-game weeks visiting every location in the game and talking to every single NPC (many of which you can only talk to on certain days) to see if there was something I missed, and nope. I finally uninstalled it at this point and immediately went to YouTube to watch a video of the ending cutscene and wow. The last cutscene totally solidified my decision to uninstall it.

I won't spoil the ending of the game, but I'll just say that ultimately I suppose I do recommend playing this game, but uninstalling the moment it starts feeling like a chore, because the ending is not worth it. Also, I wouldn't waste money on any of the DLCs because they feel like an obvious cash grab when many components of the DLCs honestly should have just been included in the first full release of the game, but weren't.",1646746471,1646746471,True,15,1,0.70089346170425415,0,True,False,False

The Ugly: Beating the game rewards the player with the most underwhelming ending I've ever seen.  It even makes fun of itself and then urges you to buy the DLC.  Way to sour the end of a long journey devs.  I won't be buying your DLC out of spite.

Notes:
You die, go to another world, and discover that you are tending to a graveyard.  Tend the graves, amke the church better, make the graveyard better, and do a lot of pretty tedious things for tedious people.  For instance, you need to make 5 gold star burgers for one quest, and 10 gold beers.  Gold star burgers require gold star onions.  Seeds for this are rare and very expensive, so growing them is a good idea.  To do THAT, you need a farm, peat (received from growing things and using a mulch pile), and fertilizer 2.  Fertilizer 2 recipe comes from doing a LOT of things to get the points to unlock it, delving deep into the dungeon, discovering the base ingredient recipes through trial and error, and researching and building the right equipment to do all this.  Plant the bronze seeds with peat and fertilizer 1 until you have enough silver star, then plant the silver with peat and fertilizer two.  EVENTUALLY you get enough.  Same thing with the hops seeds…start out with bronze, and slowly get silver, then slowly get gold.  It takes a lot of time and effort.

Another problem is timing.  Often times, I would complete a quest, then have to wait a week to turn it in.  One quest had me make a book, wait a week, get told to make a much harder book (which you have a chance to fail at unless you have the best of everything), wait a week, you get the idea.  There are a lot of time walls and a lot of wasted effort.

There were also some graphical issues, some linguistic issues, the ending wasn’t all that good, and there was a LOT of guide-dang-it.  If you don’t have the wiki, you’ll have trouble…especially since some of the resources are not renewable.

As a way to pass the time, it’s not a bad game.  It’s ok.  Not great…I’d question if it was even good…but it’ll do.

This game is a lot of fun. Starting off it's very rewarding to see your guy gather and build. I really enjoyed the gather and make money aspect (as I do with many of these sim games). The people you meet are strange and kind of entertaining. There are a lot of things that catch your interest and its fun to see what the hell you can find/do. With that being said, I feel as though the early-mid game is where the game is best.

One of the biggest problems with the game is that there seems like there is too much to do and not enough time. You learn pretty early on that you can automate certain things and it seems like it'll take a load off of your to-do list. It frees up some time from gathering but then you have to put more time into other advanced things. Not to mention that you kind of have to waddle every where. So if you're not packing speed potions then be prepared to basically have a 9-5 in the game. Not to mention the DLC adds even more stuff to the to-do list. The dungeoneering is interesting but obviously isn't supposed to be a main feature of the game.

IN SHORT:
Fun game for the first bit then it becomes ""So much to do, so little time."" Dumping bodies into the river is kind of funny though!",1646302191,1646302191,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Many things are not explained, like I played for about 20 hours and I overlooked a couple simple things at the start which woulda made things smoother.  Like totally not seeing how to get the science points which are pretty important, I thought it was from some elaborate quest chain, come to find out you just craft them with paper at a desk I made literally a hour or 2 into the game.  And because I had no science points I couldn't identify an item which unlocked so much more including zombies which make things so much easier and more efficient.  

There is A LOT to do in the game and time can fly when playing.  And you don't need to worry about missing out on things, there is not seasons like stardew valley, it's just a repeating week cycle, the only day you don't wanna miss is the sun/church day cuz that's the only way to get faith points which you need but other than that you are free to do what you want... KINDA.  It's hard to explain but people say you can play how you want and that is true but at the same time you kinda have to do all the different activities because there is usually an item or craftable from one job that is needed for a totally separate job or you won't be able to progress.

My score for this game is 8/10. All of this is my opinion. I usually don't like these kinds of games, but I took a chance with this one and oh boy I am glad I took it.
It's a kind of game where you start playing it for an hour and then look at the time and it's 5 am. Yes, it has its fair share of problems.
For example one of the biggest problems is the games name, it's called graveyard keeper but the majority of the time is spent outside of your graveyard and that's a shame. 
But at the end of the day, I think it comes down to your taste it's a hit or miss. 
And DO NOT buy DLC for this game if you haven't played the game, Because if you think the DLC will fix the problems of the game then you might be disappointed.",1645320190,1645320190,True,0,0,0.477707028388977051,0,True,False,False

This game has some problems that I personally don't like. But I do like aspects about this game. For me the game feels tedious the days last only 5 minutes which I don't think is bad but since some npc only show up on specific days if you don't make it priority them then you will have to wait for another week to talk that npc. The game doesn't have a good quest log so its possible to completely forget about quests. Last thing I dont know how to obtain specific resources. Paint is a good example the only way to get it is by crafting. Problem is there's no tech tree option to unlock it can only be unlock after talking to a npc. Overall I do like this game. I recommend looking online if you get stuck looking for something.,1645317358,1645317358,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I loved the atmostphere of this game, nice medieval Halloween vibes.
The gameplay is quite nice, but a bit too technical in my opinion, it could've been a bit more intuitive.
The music is nice. The pixelated art-style is also nice.

Overall. great game, I enjoyed it.

On the surface, it looks like a standard farming sim: you gather resources, like logs, stones, and seeds, build things, and grow plants. But there the similarity ends. You've been dropped into a bizarre world where everybody considers you to be the next in a line of graveyard keepers... and you CAN'T LEAVE. You want nothing more than to return home to your wife, but you're forced to learn how to remove organs from corpses in order to balance the good and evil in them, so you can improve the quality of the cemetery. 

And what do you do with all those body parts you've removed? You can use the skin to make paper, render the fat to make candles (because you're ALSO required to give weekly services in the church attached to the cemetery), and... bundle up those chunks of flesh to sell to the innkeeper, so he can make roast it up and serve it. 

Oh, and you also have to befriend the High Inquisitor and serve a buffet at his weekly witch burnings. Of course.

I was a bit put off by all this, at first, but the dark humor is infectious. While I can't say I grew to love the characters in this bizarre community, I certainly found them all amusing and sympathetic. The gameplay can be a challenge, at first, and you'll probably have to dig through the forums and the wiki pages, in order to figure out what you're doing, at times, but it's a lot of fun. 

One thing to note: the game as it's presented doesn't have much of an ending. However, the DLCs add one, along with a lot of additional content that makes the game significantly better. Unfortunately, they aren't free.",1645256917,1645256917,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

SPOILERS FROM HERE FORWARD

-SPOILERS-

Storyline threads - The game has a rather complicated weave of stories that tangle and bring characters to each other and is great. But a lot of them are left hanging at the end. The main storyline gets an ending, kinda. But still leaves many questions after

Exploration - The game has plenty of places you get to explore and find and utilize. But once you do...it just stops. Once you know the map, nothing new comes up.. Can't go to the Town™, can't cross the broken bridge that used to ferry souls to the afterlife, can't even clear the rubble down the narrow swamp pathway that is above your house(where the green slime spawn). You end up feeling very boxed in, including once you have cleared all the floors of the dungeon(which doesn't even respawn enemies to fight which really surprised me)

User Interface/Experience(UI/UX) - For the most part, the game does what it needs to for you to play it. Menus work, able to select things, etc. But once you really get into the game where you have 20 chests/shelves/etc. and you want to find one thing? Good luck. And that's not even if you have zombies filling them up with menial tasks assigned to them that autofill those trunks with their completed work. You're unable to keep things organized because the zombies don't seem to care where they put the things they make and you can't designate certain trunks to be certain items, or even a certain type of item. They just go and go and go until they have no space to fill and stop. If we could change the color of the chests or make it so certain chests are for food, certain ones are for metal, etc. it would make managing the resources much more user friendly.

Crafting/Demolishing - The amount of things you can craft in this game is fantastic. I enjoyed it a lot and have no complaints about the amount of stuff to discover and make and use. But the problem with having so many things you can make and use it ends up becoming a lot to deal with if you don't have a means to handle it in game at a higher scale volume. Bookshelves, scrollshelves, trunks, and such are great but placed it in a spot you later see will be in the way for a new thing you need to progress in the game?

Well you have to destroy the thing, get 50%/75% of your resources back, everything spilled onto the floor for you to pick up, make the new thing, and then remake the container for those things (if you have the space) and put it all back in there. I understand and get that the Keeper can't just pick up the bookshelves and move them himself, but we are also talking about a game with zombies that do nearly everything for you. I don't think rearranging furniture is a far stretch compared to the other things you can do. 

Also - In Build Mode you can label something to be torn down which you can approach afterward and do so. Straightforward, that's fine. But the marker you use to highlight those objects? If not much is around, it can be annoying to keep track of. A lot of things there? You need to know the grid of spots it can be for you to have an idea of where it is so you don't highlight the wrong thing. It's a small red marker that disappears under objects. You have no indication of where it is at all until it isn't on the grid where any item is. It also does not highlight the object it is under that would at least tell you where it is and know what you are trying to demolish. It took me a few hours of trying to understand what I had to do with the marker before I understood how the demo feature worked because nothing explains it to you at all.

How-To - Continuing that thought, there isn't much of an explanation on how to do things in the game. It takes a lot of trial and error to understand how things work, who sells/buys what, etc. I didn't even know how to use zombies after they were made until I put one in front of a tool by accident. They lay on the ground and do nothing, so I thought there was more to be done for them to do the work. 

Overall the game IS a lot of fun to play, but only if you're patient enough to understand it's inner-workings and deal with the minor clunky issues. Definitely not a game for people who don't have a deconstructive mindset to figure it all out that could be resolved very easily in a patch. Love the game, but those parts definitely make it feel unfinished. Hoping a new DLC will come out and fix it all.",1645245016,1645245016,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Don't be fooled by the ""hours played"" you see on reviews for this game.  They're double or even triple digits because of massive amounts of waiting and padding, not because of content.  If you really have to have it, wait for that 75% off sale that occasionally rolls around.

The game tries really hard to be a macabre Stardew Valley clone.  Unfortunately, it lacks the infrastructure for this.  While it's true that you have the church, the graveyard, a tavern, a small farm, a vineyard, a refugee camp, an alchemy lab, a small business, crafting on top of of all this, and even a generic dungeon, the game gives you piss-poor integration of these features with each other.  Since money is really only used to shortcut certain items in the game, there's no reason to upscale production on any front, even if they were well-developed in the first place (which they aren't).

You play some dude who gets transported to another world in order to become its new Graveyard Keeper.  There's no explanation for this, and you'd better get used to that because this is a wiki game with bad storytelling and grammatical errors.  You're told that you're not only the new Keeper, but also that you run the church.  Because reasons.  It's perfectly natural to everyone you speak to that you're the new Keeper, nobody questions it, and your character won't either.  A couple of them don't even bat an eye when you say that you're from another world.  Your objective is to ""get home to your love"". 

The story is a train wreck and is ultimately why I gave it a thumbs-down.  There are some great ideas, and APPARENT lore.  Against a medieval setting where you're really more of an alchemist than a graveyard keeper or a priest, you're told about things like ""a ship of the dead"" and ""witches"" and ""The Great Blast (an apocalypse)"".  There's even apparently a whole town you'll never visit.  Most of the ACTUAL story is playing through character questlines that are typically shallow, and you'll be required to do fifteen favors for each of a  half-dozen characters before the game is over.  

ALMOST EVERY TURN in a questline will require an item from you, and it's not going to tell you how to get it, or what skills you need in the obnoxious skill trees to make it yourself.  Have fun Googling.  Every favor requires ten things you have to do before you can just get on with it, and the game's terrible UI and almost non-existent quest log makes certain that keeping track of all these things surpasses all limits of human short-term memory.  This was by far the most irritating part of the game, and I resented it long before it was over.

There's some good tongue-in-cheek humor, and unfortunately that includes the ending, where you are cheerfully told that the resolution to the game's various mysteries and plotlines might happen in expensive DLC.  No, I'm not kidding.  For a game that's a slog for at least 50 hours from beginning to end, this is a slap in the face.  

The game delights in creating problems and then selling the solutions.  Too much to do?  Get some zombies (which were originally a DLC, by the way).  Oh, you want them to work at above a snail's pace? They need better parts, but for that you'll need a DLC.  What's that?  The tasks they can't do?  You'll need a DLC to do that remotely.  You want some things cleared up about the story or characters in the original game?  We've got DLC for you!  

As far as actual gameplay goes, when you're not trying to keep track of a horrific number of things to do, the game is separated into different days of the week, and each major character that's important to the story can only be found on ONE of these.  There's technically no time limit on 95% of things that happen, but if you don't have what a character needs to progress, or you get it the very next day, you'll be waiting another week regardless.  The flow of corpses into the graveyard is thankfully controlled by carrots (don't ask), so that's not a problem either.

At the end of the day, it's a great time-waster, and I liked the setting and general tone.  But the overall lack of polish, the grind, the bugs, the crashes, no manual saving, and that kick to the groin I got instead of a proper wrap-up of loose ends was too much for me.",1645060329,1645060329,False,29,0,0.704322099685668945,0,True,False,False

Graveyard Keeper allows you to play several different roles within the community and is written with a sense of humour. You'll strip flesh from the dead and then go and plant some carrots for your Communist donkey friend all while trying to spruce up the graveyard that you've found yourself keeper of. Overall the game is fun to play, although there is a relatively steep learning curve (more than Stardew Valley) with the crafting and which devices do what that sometimes is not intuitive (e.g. there are about four or five woodworking machines - which while reflective of real life, is quite frustrating until you figure out where to go for what and have the resources/energy to build them all). 

If you don't like inventory management, this game is not for you. While your inventory is not small, the stacking quantities vary per item (anywhere from not stacking whatsoever, which is incredibly irritating as you have to source the resources and build the chests you use, in a limited area, to stacking 100 items. Most average around 20-30 items per stack). I hope there is a future update where everything can be stacked as some of the items that do not stack don't make sense - you can stack 10 skulls but not stack hearts whatsoever, as an example.

The game can be challenging to keep track of all of the quests and duties you have as they are arranged per NPC rather than having a list of quests you can quickly look up. Similarly, the game lacks a 'recipe vault' for all of the recipes you've learned, which results in a lot of backtracking when you want to, say, build a beehive and discover you've brought the wrong type of wood as you can only see the recipe for the beehive AT the apiary. Considering the main character has access to ink and paper, I would hope he would be clever enough to form a book of all of his recipes, even if the book had to be crafted out of chapters or something. 

Despite those minor issues, the game is still very fun to play. So far, I haven't come across any time-sensitive quests, which is good because it is easy to get engrossed with a quest or goal you have and to allow other quests to fall by the wayside, particularly as many of the characters are only available on certain days of the week (though this is helpfully indicated within the NPC list).

Unfortunately, the main storyline holds it back nearing the end.

You've got your lovely visuals, atmospheric mists and rains and all that neat stuff. Some stunning lighting effects if you ever get as far as putting some lantern posts in your graveyard, they must have 3D-mapped the 2D grave monuments and such, somehow? A very nice detail, it must be said.

The game itself is... sort of Stardew Valley-ish, with a variety of weird crafting and questionable ways to make money. You manage a graveyard, a church and its sermons, the workyard where you craft stuff, and pretty soon a crop garden and orchard too. Oh, and an underground study/laboratory. Aaand a vineyard. There's a [i]lot[/i] of stuff to build, so if you're into building stuff, that might be pretty fun. Also there's various barricades you can clear to unlock what may in some cases be shortcuts to important places like the heart of the stupid swirly swamp - or the aforementioned vineyard, from a convenient workyard-side entrance. Like Stardew, there's energy management - you eat and sleep to restore energy, while building, crafting, working on stuff and the like will spend energy.

Be warned: there's an awful lot of busywork and a lot of running back and forth. You'll want to buy the reusable teleport stone from the tavern guy as early as you can, though the destination list is sadly limited. The base game focuses on the stories of six particular people who each appear on a different day of the game's six-day week. They're interwoven and it's usually the wrong day to talk to whoever you were meaning to, which gets annoying. Still, you can meditate through entire days at the stone garden (once you build it near your home) if you like.

The first DLC , Stranger Sins, features a ridiculous amount of running back and forth, coming back the next day, and the like. Focused on digging up memories of the past. It has some pretty imagery of the pre-game era, but this gradually gives way to depressing ""Ah, so this is all the stuff that went wrong"" type stuff. It will help you earn money, which can be hard in the base game and necessary to finish the main story, but eh. Barely worth your own time and money.

The second DLC, Game of Crone, is in my opinion... better. We've got some interesting stuff happening, some people you can help, I found myself getting kind of invested in how it would turn out. Would probably recommend that one.

The game's story is kind of okay. Interesting, for the most part. At the same time, many of the characters are kind of just there and don't have much personality or identity beyond ""guy who sells sticks and other wood products"". The DLCs kind of take a poke at fixing this, but you shouldn't really need DLC to have characters who are characters, yeah? There are actually some pretty nice moments with the main cast of the base game toward the end of their story arcs, but whether you'll play long enough to find out... that's the question.

Sort of recommended. A game with nice music and atmosphere, but all the long walks back and forth and busywork tasks and cash-grinding do make one kind of tense up, at least in my experience. Grates with the atmosphere a bit. Probably better played with more of a chill attitude than I can manage.",1644790008,1644790008,True,2,0,0.519841313362121582,0,True,False,False

The idea of running a graveyard and church while keeping up appearances in a stardew valley style is wonderful. However, the game throws that out in the first hour. It goes from telling you how to deal with corpses and the church to grinding quests for an eternity. In stardew valley, you did quests and helped people just like this, but you didn't completely abandon your farm as your source of income. In this, you can't progress with just the graveyard. The donkey requires carrots or i cant get corpses. okay ill just get the farm next to me. Cant get the farm plot without one gold. Okay i'll focus on the skull quests. need to unlock trade which requires money. No money from graveyard cause donkey. What about the church? oh its one day a week and it doesn't even give a silver. FINE i'll just go do some quests that don't require money. Wrong Day, okay ill wait. with nothing to do except grind. Finally get there and realize i took to long getting there cause unless you go immediatly the walk takes forever. A few hours in i get my first zombie. Great, its useless cause i cant progress without researching the blue techs. To research you need to study items. The items that give blue research are from corpses. Cant get corpses.

Tldr: Wait ages for certain days needed to complete quests. Super slow with massive distances.

So I've obviously been putting off the main quest, because the management gameplay is what I enjoy.  I'm not gonna spoil anything for you here, but you do need to know: THE GAME DOES NOT AUTO-SAVE AT ANY POINT BEFORE OR DURING THE ENDING.  You start up the portal, you will be kicked back to your last savegame.  I was kicked back over three hours of play... including progress on several other quests and a huge amount of miscellaneous contented basement-rearranging.  And as they were pouring my time down the drain in this manner, they gave me a cutscene during which two of our friends bemoan the lack of resolution to many storylines and the lack of features, and assert that they intend to make more money with these things as DLC.

It's one thing to kick me in the teeth.  It's quite another to kick me in the teeth and then merrily say, ""Wasn't that fun, friend?  I'll be back tomorrow to ask you for more money, ain't I a cute rascal?  Tee-hee!""

After years of the same ridiculous interface nonsense, years of underwhelming DLC releases for rather exorbitant prices, years of virtually no progress on most of the story, I was fine.

The first few hours were slow but enjoyable and the story pointed me in the right direction. A few hours in the game picked up pace and I was enjoying myself while working on corpses, tending my garden and generally having a good time.

Little did I know that what awaited me was a story of loss, tragedy, hope, forgiveness and twists, quite a few twists. If I came here for the Stardew Valley-ish gameplay, then I stayed purely because of the story. I enjoyed every single hour of this game as everything just fits so perfectly together in my opinion and spoiling any details would be simply unfair.

[b] Do be warned though [/b]
Every quest in this game is, essentially, just a fetch quest. Go speak to this person, bring them this item, wait until this day, advance this plot point first. I did not mind this because the gameplay itself is very solid and I did not mind it too much if that was the cost of seeing the payoff of the story, but I can definitely see how this could turn some people away.

There also isn't much to do after the main story ends as all that is left is essentially ""make a lot of good corpse"" or ""make big money"". Which is fine, just not my thing.

I'd say it's quite different though, it's less farming and more quest-driven, the pace is quicker - although you CAN take it slow and chill, I already have more than 100 hours in-game and still haven't finished it (I kind of don't want it to end tbh).
Obviously the dark, tongue-in-cheek theme and humor are also pretty unique, somewhat giving Monty Python vibes which is always a good thing if you ask me. I don't want to spoil it too much but if managing a medieval graveyard, conducting weird experiments on corpses and frolicking with the inquisition are themes that speak to your soul, do not think twice and get this game ! 
I also really enjoyed the graphics and overall look of the game and map, they are perfectly executed and suited to the game - they really manage to set the mood, in a retro kind-of-way of course. But that's all very subjective ! 
 
It's easy to get a bit lost in the beginning as NPCs and quests keep popping up. There's a lot of things to do in this game, you'll need to focus and prioritize your goals, but hold on to it - it's really worth it !

Graveyard Keeper is truly one of the best games I've played in the past few years.

For a few critiques, as others have pointed out, the game does not hold the players hand very well with learning new mechanics, and the game has a serious problem with pacing and timing. For most of the main quest, the main NPCs you'll need to work with are only available and appear one day out of the week, and the way the game sets up the quests typically requires you to daisy chain constantly between multiple main quest NPCs who (seemingly) were always available just the previous day. Meaning, you'd have to wait almost an entire week to go talk to that other person; and then THAT person needs a special thing from a another main NPC who was available only yesterday as well, then rinse and repeat. All these main quest NPC's also live in a place called ""The Town"" which is impossible to get to.

2. Grindy, you have get one item for something simple, but to get that item you grind to unlock the recipes for another items which also require the unlocking of more recipes, after unlocking everything you have get the materials which are in opposite corners of the map, then you have to wait and wait and when you finish with that, you can unlock a little thing that doesn't do much at all and should have been unlocked earlier.
3. The energy system, it's so trivial that it's just annoying, the lack energy can be mitigated by making tons of cheap food and that's it, it's no longer a problem and it doesn't matter anymore.
4.Small little things that accumulate, there's so much stuff that you will ignore at first but at one point you will no longer be able, the worse part is that they could easily fix most of it but haven't

As many reviews have stated, the core game play loop is to buy corpses from a talking donkey with carrots that a talking skull teaches you how to carve up for meat which you sell to the local tavern so he can make sandwiches out of it that the locals will take to a witch burning ceremony. Those are real things that happen in this game.

But before two hours have even passed, you will get pulled into the game's super-interconnected, grindy mechanics. The donkey wants carrots. Okay, that means farming which means continuously buying seeds and researching farming, for which you will need money. That means burying your first few corpses which will mean learning how to make gravestones and little grave fences which means gathering resources, more research, and building crafting stations. The donkey wants oil now so you'll have to talk to the local crazy person who wants honey so go buy some bees to make honey to bring to the crazy person who gives you oil to the donkey who wants carrots from which you can get corpses to cut meat which you can sell to the tavern owner after you profess enough faith at the church that the local thief will get you a fake USDA stamp so you can brand your corpse meat as hamburger to get the money you need to buy the bees. It rapidly becomes *exhausting*.

There isn't enough time in the game day to get all of this stuff done even if there was time in your real life day to try to figure it out. And there's no possible way you can figure all this stuff out organically. You will have a wiki open 15 minutes into starting this game which you will never get to close.

If that sounds appealing, go for it. There's certainly many, many hours of game play here.

Also did I mention that the corpse came via a donkey, wait let me rephrase, a communist talking donkey that cites Animal Farm who also brings corpses from the same town that your thrown corpse is floating towards. Yeah this pretty much sums it up.

Besides the jokes, this is a very grindy game. In order to do X, you need to do K, L and M and in order to do K you need to J but while you're doing J, you require human skulls(which you can remove from corpses that you got from the same donkey, no biggie) but then donkey decides that he is not going to play by the capitalist rules(?) and decides that in order for him to bring corpses to you, he requires 5 carrots(still a communist). So you start growing carrots and in order to grow carrots.... 

The game has a very balanced humor which I really enjoyed. It's a similar game to Stardew Valley so if you liked that one, you MIGHT like this one. This game is a little bit darker, I mean you're burying bodies and retrieving flesh from corpses to make hamburgers.

Graveyard Keeper is a game of three parts.  The early game (up to becoming a Rightful Citizen, about 5~10 hours in) is okay. It does a decent job of introducing major mechanics, but you'll probably still want to look up a few ""getting started"" videos to really wrap your head around it.  Your primary goal is to complete quests for the six main villagers (each of whom appears for one day out of the six-day week), which will involve scaling up your crafting capabilities and skill tree to be able to make more complex stuff, and improving your graveyard and church to accumulate money and faith (two crucial resources.)  ""Scaling up"" in this case requires attending to a LOT of different ways to interact with the world, so as others have said, it's more grindy and complicated that a game like Stardew.  You'll pretty much always have five things on your to-do list for a given day, and only ever have enough time to do two or three of them.

The second part is the mid-game (up to becoming an Aristocrat, about 40 hours in), and this is where the game [b] really [/b] gets good.  You've become more familiar with the world and can plan your days more effectively.  You've got a handle on how to modify bodies and can start really optimizing your graveyard.  Your crafting engine starts building and you gain the ability to start automating gathering and most crafting, allowing you to spend more time on activities that matter.  You start getting access to fun buffs and interesting skills.  The DLC content starts to kick in, which is some of the most fun content in the game.  By the time you reach the end of the mid-game, you truly feel a sense of progress as you've gone from barely keeping your head above water to mastering the game's many systems and having an engine propelling you full throttle to the very expensive Aristocrat license you need to progress the story.

Aaaaand then the game grinds to a halt as the endgame starts.  After buying the Aristocrat License, there's nothing meaningful to spend money on, so that engine you've spent 40 hours building is suddenly without purpose.  You're swimming in faith and money generation now, so there's no reason to improve your graveyard or church.  You've completed most quests (including DLC) and your skill tree is almost maxed out.  All that's left to do but wrap up a few final quests to get to credits.  Unfortunately, those final quests are exceedingly drawn out, being focused on one specific character who only shows up once a week, and requiring several weeks to complete.  This means that, if you want to see the credits, you're going to sit around twiddling your thumbs for a couple of hours waiting for this character to come around.  I got too frustrated and decided to just watch a video of the ending, and I'm glad I stopped when I did.

So, I recommend this game for the many hours of fun I had during the midgame, and I absolutely think it was worth the cost.  I just wish the endgame were more balanced to make the work done during the midgame feel more valuable.",1643325417,1643325753,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This persons review sums up my experiences with the game, however I will write my own opinion below.  https://steamcommunity.com/id/GoldenHopper1983/recommended/599140/

This game is a battle between the fun game mechanics and the terrible/tedious/tiring game mechanics.  After playing 10 hours, I downloaded some mods to remove some of the annoying game mechanics - this made the game a lot more enjoyable for me and is the reason why I would ""maybe recommend"" it if you as a player are ok with modding your game, but without modding, this game feels like a slow chore with no clear goal.

The fun game mechanics are the graveyard sim game loop.  Lots of different ways to progress and it is a lot of fun trying to maximize your graveyard rating / church rating.  There are different ways to build/craft/customize your game experience.  Later on you get ""helpers"" (don't want to spoil it) and these units help reduce some of the tedious resource grinding.  The game looks good with solid animations and the sound/music is nice too.

First, the game severely lacks helpful information for the player.  The tutorial covers the basics and never goes into the more advanced parts of the game.  The UI is horrible, especially for certain crafting/tasks and managing your inventory/storage is a special experience.  The tool tips on items isn't helpful for anything besides research/alchemy, and it sucks for alchemy too.  There are tons of items in this game and sometimes you won't know what to do with them due to the limited information.

The quest log ui deserves its own paragraph.  Some quests are tracked while others are not.  Some NPCs will repeat their quest dialog if you talk to them, while others will not.  One quest, a ghost visits you early on and tells you to dig up a body.  This quest isn't shown on the quest screen, so if you forget what body you need to dig up, you won't complete the quest... and the ghost disappears, preventing you for asking them for help or repeating the quest dialog.  If this wasn't bad enough, there is an extremely important tutorial screen/info as a reward for completing this quest, so if you don't complete the quest, you never see the tutorial screen and won't find out what the skulls mean on corpses and how they affect your graveyard rating. (Why hide tutorial screens in quests??  The tutorial screens can be viewed again via the menu, but only the ones you've unlocked???)

Second, while the game is an open world, play at your own pace, do what you want, experience.  Much of the game progress is locked behind quests.  This is made worst by the fact that quest NPCs only show up on a single day of a six day ""game week"", so if you miss them, you have to wait six days for them to appear again.  One quest you get early on takes three weeks to complete because it requires you to interact with 2 different NPCs four times and since they don't appear on the same day of the week, it becomes a chore to remember to talk to each NPC on the correct day (or you'll have to wait another week for them to show up!)

If you are going to buy this game, read a player guide or the wiki first.  Read about the quest order (initially) so you aren't wasting time.  A lot of unlocks are locked behind quests and not being aware of this can waste a ton of your time.  (Hint: Find the witch to unlock alchemy early, complete Ms. Charms' initial quest early, complete Snake's initial quest early, every other quest can be progressed at your own pace)

Third, the energy/taskbar system is extremely tedious after a certain point.  Everything except 2 crafts have a taskbar and some crafts take 30 seconds to complete (ie. you hold a key for 30 seconds watching an animation).  You will run out of energy early in the game and will need to sleep, which is basically you watching a 10 second sleep animation while your energy regenerates.  You can cook food to help with energy, but the cooking ui is awful and you are limited to a single fireplace for cooking food which cannot be cancelled once started.  (Note: after 10 hours, I couldn't take the energy management and constant sleeping, so I modded the game to give me a lot of energy regen per second, thus I never need to sleep.  I've probably saved myself at least an hour of irl time by not having to watch the sleep animations again.)

Fourth, building/storage/crafting is one of the worst experiences I've had in a farming sim.  It is a huge chore to organize your storage.  It is a huge chore to find items in your storage when using the crafting ui (ie. it doesn't hide items you can't use, instead you need to scroll through all your items/storage containers looking for the items that the recipe needs).  There are recipes that use tiered items (ie. different rarities) and I cannot even describe how frustrating those crafting recipes are to navigate (note: you can't queue these recipes, so you have to use the bad ui every time you craft a tiered item).  Some of the tiered items aren't even used!  (40 hours in and I still don't know what silver bars are used for, or what to do with the 10 gold star statues I crafted)

With building, you cannot move benches/chests/whatever.  You need to deconstruct it first and rebuild it.  You are restricted to only building in pre-defined spots.  These spots have a limited number of tiles to build in and you'll soon discover how limited you are in customizing your work/industry area.

There is no way to search for items in your storage.  There is no way to filter or sort the items.  There is no indication if a container is full besides interacting with it.  Some areas have specific storage container art/size and you can only build those, while other areas limit the amount of storage space you have (ie. the church exterior starts with one container and you can build a second one, but no more).  You cannot move a single stack of items with a single click, either you have to select the quantity, or move all stacks at once.  You cannot drop items on the ground, only destroy them.

Fifth, logs/stone/iron blocks will be the end of you.  You cut down a tree.  It drops two wood logs, but you can only pick up one to carry to the stockpile.  Repeat everytime you need wood/stone (until you get helpers unlocked).  These blocks are the only things in this game that don't go in your inventory...  yet you can hold a billion tons of stone slabs and carry around 20 marble statues without issue.  Also these blocks cannot be destryoyed like other items, so they just sit on the ground and get in your way. (ie. late game when you cut down a tree for the sticks and leave the wood blocks on the ground.

Sixth, you only save when you sleep.  No autosaving.  The game is pretty stable, but I feel bad for those who have crashed after two hours of gameplay and haven't used a bed to save.

To conclude this rant, if you are thinking of buying this game, I highly suggest you read the wiki and player guides to figure out how to play the game before you play.  This isn't a ""steep learning curve"" thing, this is a ""I guess I'll restart the game due to how poorly the game teaches you about the mechanics and then punishes you for all the mistakes you have made"" thing.

If you take 5 minutes, read about skull rating (autopsies); getting blue tech points; how to unlock your helpers; and how to preach / make money quickly.  If you have another 5 minutes, read about what quests to do early; what items are worth keeping (ie. autopsy); what recipes are good for energy/regen; alchemy (it is a chore without a guide); and getting 12 skull ratings on corpses.  If you have another 5 minutes, download UMF / GKMultiMod and PrayEveryday (super easy to install / setup) or look on nexus for mods.",1604303401,1643231408,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

And if you're even one second too late the character starts walking away and won't let you speak with them about what you need for another week. It gets particularly heinous once you gear near the late game because as you whittle down your to-do list, you have less and less stuff to do in between so you just try to waste your energy so you can sleep until the day you need it to be.

Its a grind-fest to do anything and many aspects are confusing. Ultimately all the grinding for the first series of quests is all unnecessary because the town you need the pass for doesn't exist you just die at the gate. There is also no penalty for dying. You can literally use it as a way to get back home because you can't really do much in the Dungeon anyway. Your stamina is way to low to get anything done anywhere.

The height of your enjoyment lies in the mid-game, as your understanding of and access to the crafts and technologies begins the broaden. What follows is a positively dreadful, dead snail paced, outright mean spirited grindfest. The reward for said grind is a flippant reference to the DLCs available for purchase so you can have a more complete experience. NPCs actually remark that the experience - the videogame - feels incomplete. ""We didn't finish"" doesn't strike me as a strong selling point for additional content. Though, even if it were an agreeable tactic, you'll surely be so drained and repelled by the end-game experience that tacking even more hours onto that is the last thought on your mind.

Despite the graphical charm and the intriguing titular gravekeeper mechanic, there's both not enough and entirely too much here to warrant your time, never mind pricing. A laundry list of odd design choices and jarring quality-of-life issues actively impede an already frustrating experience (whoever signed off on the player character's movement speed should be spanked). Customizing your workshops is nigh impossible due to placement constraints, the dungeon and combat are plainly an afterthought, and as I write I cannot recall a note of the music.

Additionally, the late game can become very stale. It happend several times that I had to wait for one person to show up in town, while nothing else needed to be done.
I only played the core game without any DLCs, so this might change with them. But the last few hours I sunk into the game made me not want to spend any more time with it or buy the DLCs (and go through it all again).

-I want to get some wine for this early quest
1. figure out that you need a lot of blue research to get that
2. get a method of getting blue research
3. set up the zombies
4. spend another 10 hours setting up the shit and doing it
5. upgrade the smelter
6. make glass
7. make a shit workbench
8. look up a guide on how to use the shit workbench because otherwise it is literally impossible to use because it does not give you any hint as to what you need to use to make the things you want
9. try to remember for the 50th time what you were actually trying to do
10. make the things you need to do the wine
11. get the skills you need to do the wine
13. make wine

note that all of the above steps SUCK if you really don't want to do them at the time and there are around 4 other things you don't want to do at every moment that you need to do and so every thing that you might be interested in is blocked by around 10 hours of shit gameplay and from what I understand they never actually finished the story and just made a joke about how they can't be bothered to finish the story, Everything about this game on the surface draws you in but it is just not worth it.",1642205506,1642205506,False,1,0,0.508196711540222168,0,True,False,False

I don't want to be guided through the whole game, but some critical points of progression are just unknown. For a game like Stardew, the wiki helps you better manage your time and resources, but for this game, the wiki feels like a necessity. Someone with hundreds of hours who knows the ins-and-outs of how this game work will probably disagree with me, but it is very hard for new players to know what to do. 

 And as for it being too grindy, the amount of essence you need to unlock necessary crafting recipes is ridiculous. Also, you'll spend your time unlocking one recipe just to find out you can't craft it until you go 3 steps down a different skill tree. The best and seemingly intended way to get essence for recipes is to study materials which requires faith, but faith is so hard to come by. They make you wait a whole week to only get 5 faith.
Also, everything, and I mean everything requires energy. This isn't too much of a problem causes there's really no drawback to sleeping. There's really no need for time management, so you can just sleep whenever. But that being said, the limits of the energy bar feel more annoying than anything.

I really love this game's concept, art design, and music, but I just can't get through playing it. I few improvements to make this game more user friendly would make it a 10/10. Like a small change they could make that would greatly improve the game would be to allow you to view crafting recipes from your inventory.

I really enjoy being able to play the game and just cut off my brain.  Much like with games like Stardew Valley, Oxygen Not Included, and Going Medevil; I use these games to dull the mind.  But I digress.  Graveyard keeper is pretty grind worthy, it has a nice story, and the DLCs are pretty good.  I would say buy them on sale though.  I realized a lot of work went into developing them and all but, some of the DLC content for games these days are kind of pricey for not a lot of content.  The biggest grind you are probably going to have is the graveyard itself.  Finding the right bodies is going to take you forever.  The UI is worked pretty well and you can play just as well with a control as you can with a keyboard.  The story line is well written and is pretty humorous as well.  I have beaten and restarted the game multiple times, but I am a weirdo who uses games like this for something to do when I watch TV, am bored, or utilize the steam app on multiple devices to play when I am waiting somewhere or lunch breaks, whatnot.  It is safe to say that, to me, it is very repayable.  Advice on money.  money can be hard to come by at the beginning, but make shovels and pickaxes to sell.  They seem the easiest and quickest to make more money with.  With energy needs, muffins are probably your best bet at the beginning.  As soon as you can buy the recipes do so.  I personally like the zombie dlc the best.  Oh, and you will need faith something awful, so start with making that prayer first.  Fishing is okay, but I really have no use for it when playing the game and think if you could get special stuff from it or something, I do not know.  It is just an after thought for me.

I saw this during the winter sale and decided to trey it, and I'm glad I did because now I'm completely addicted. It's completely taken Stardew Valley's place for the time being lmao

Aside from the several shading glitches I've seen, the graphics are so pretty and detailed(I especially like how the water looks). The NPCs are also pretty fun and expressive in their animations. While most of the characters don't have much to do with the main story, the ones you do interact with can be charming and entertaining. I enjoy the dark humor a lot, and the music is nice and catchy. I like being able to stay awake a full 24 hrs instead of being forced to sleep at a certain time like other farming sim games. Tasks also don't have time limits, so it allows you to go more at your own pace. The voice acting is also really cute. I love this game a lot and will probably put in close to the same amount of time I put into SV lol

One thing that's kind of annoying, though, is that this game is really hard because it gives you almost no information on what to do, but I kinda like it that way because stumbling onto certain things can be fun. Plus this game has a pretty extensive Wiki to help you through. I also experience a lot of visual glitches as well as twitching and lag, especially around my farm and workyard. I also find the whole time and quest systems kind of annoying because the whole game is basically this huge fetch quest where you have to get an item from someone and bring it to someone else over and over again, but you can only see a lot of these people on specific days of the week. So, in cases where you 1. just miss someone right as they're leaving their spot or 2. get an item from someone who wants you to give it to the person you just saw the day before, you'll be waiting a full ingame week to finish a task. Skipping through the week doesn't take too long, though, and there's plenty of other stuff to do, but it's still really fucking annoying lol and it makes grinding for cash even harder. Another really annoying thing about this game is that you can't stack some items while crafting for some reason. Like why can't I queue several of the same items for the hand mixer? Why are you making me grind up one flower at a time? And why does blood/fat/bones stack but each of my hearts/intestines/brains take up individual slots and take up space? It's so stupid. Also the fishing minigame fuckin sucks ngl and the English/grammar is god awful half the time.

The main reason why I decided to leave a review, however, is this shit that happened to me today. I was playing GK with about 55 hrs clocked in when my PC completely froze after locking up for a second. I reset it and get back into the game when I notice that my save data is completely wiped. I was eventually able to get it back after I was done shitting myself, but that was after looking through several forums and trying different methods. Even the developer advise didn't work. All the top results I found left out a crucial step in my case(I had to delete and replace the INFO file in my GK folder with one you have to download from the dev's site). During my research, I noticed that this has been an issue since the game's been out. I saw a person complaining about this shit happening to them 4 days ago. I've never had this happen to me in a game before, and it's insane that it's still an issue here. Can this not be patched out or something? 

I know most of this has been mostly pretty negative, but this game's really fun and addicting. This is just me warning you of some of the downsides of playing this game. These shortcomings are wayyyyy overshadowed by all the good things, though. It can be rough in the beginning when you're still figuring out all the complex stuff, but once you have it figured out you'll feel like a master. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys Stardew Valley/Harvest Moon type games.  It's well worth the money as you'll definitely get several hours' worth from the gameplay.

I felt like I had to search the discussion feed and wiki more often than not due to a lack of explanation. One of the mechanics of the game is alchemy and when researching items and understanding which to use to make what was a total wiki only moment for me. When researching items it just states if it can become a powder or something and doesn't really expand on what powder it becomes. Getting recipes is basically just a trial and error thing and doesn't save anything you make unless it is a potion. Another thing is that in the main game you can learn to make many potions but don't have really a use for them. Another mechanic that fell through is the embalming table. I wished that when you made the table that they would have expanded on how to make embalming liquids and such but no it is another wiki moment. The other mechanics of the game are fine such as farming, crafting, and burying corpses. I thought the fishing mechanic was weak since you could just mess around until you caught the fish. 
The game visuals was cool. I like the design of the environment and characters. The characters' voices were funny and matched the game. The soundtrack was also okay. The map design was fine as well. I felt like the graveyard was a bit larger than needed due to beating the game and using only half of it. 
The game was cool but there were some annoying grinding parts. The grinding parts include digging up clay & river sand. Of course later on you make an extreme amount of money so you can just buy necessary items. I hated getting was the blue points which was hard.

One piece of advice is to hoard your stones at first, they don't regenerate like the trees do. Only build things as you need them so you don't run out of yard space. Some quests can only be completed after learning/ unlocking technology, so don't worry about getting everything done all at once. Lastly try to bury bodies as fast as you can, and don't over harvest them. They'll bring down the cemetery average (boost it by decorating graves and any leftover yard space).",1641833201,1641833201,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story line is unique and keeps you guessing. the DLC's are very fun and help explain a lot of the holes in the main story line.
I do advise:
1) look online at the fandom wikki, it will come in handy when you get confused. 
2) If you were to focus on a DLC to do while doing the main story line, I advise prioritizing Game of Crone. The rewards you get while completing that story lines tasks will help out greatly and reduce a lot of the grind that you would otherwise have to do to complete the main story line.
3) It adds a lot to the games story value if you complete the DLC's before completing the main story line so far. With the exception of Better Save Soul, that one really didn't in my opinion affect the games overall story line, but was still very fun to play and it also introduces a  new talent tree that comes in handy during the game play.

I had to play the ending twice to get whats going on and it explains a lot (i am doing my best to review it without giving spoilers) I as of this writing have completed the main story, and all DLC as well, so I am caught up and now am only playing to complete my talent trees and church / graveyard upgrades.

Sadly, I leave most play sessions feeling frustrated. The exact opposite of what these sims should leave you feeling.
There's never enough time, inventory space, supplies, or money to feel in any way productive or, heck, creative with what productivity you do manage. The game makes me feel so limited and offers no help in figuring out its many mechanics that might help manage the constant shortcomings. I spent so much time on guides for this game to try and figure out what I was doing wrong and still couldn't find a good flow.
It's so easy to completely miss certain branches of progress, too. Still haven't figured out how to unlock Alchemy, so I'll be looking it up in the wiki if I play again... That's really just the game experience. 
Cute dialogue and characters, though. Pleasant music. A nice amount of space that I wish I could ride a donkey through.
I will come back once I find a mod that connects chests or something. The slogging supplies back and forth (and then forgetting what you needed in the first place and running back to check the recipe with whatever ingredients you guessed wrong and then 'porting back to correct the guess and then running back again if the placement is right oh look the day is over time to wait another week before I can advance a quest) makes me sad.

599140,107660709,76561197980601708,0,12,9557,0,8674,1641903956,"Graveyard Keeper is a great entry into the rural-sim genre, with enough macabre and unexpected features to hook you in. It falls short of greatness, however, due to its lack of respect for player time, an opaque technology system and the frustration of managing large inventory stores.  If you're looking for a game to scratch that Stardew Valley itch, GK will do that - but I suspect it won't quite be your favourite fantasy farm.

There's a lot to like about GK. A sprawling town and wilderness that unlocks progressively as you gain skills and materials, mysterious goings-on in the graveyard, and an interesting plot that weaves its way through everyone you meet. There's a great degree of freedom in how you choose to play day-by-day - if you want to spend days at a time mining or lumberjacking, so be it. There's no penalty for being late for any appointment, so don't feel pressured to catch that fish by 2am or whatever. That said, certain characters are only available once per week - so sometimes missing the right day can put your story progress on the backburner. It's possible to sleep or meditate to push the clock forward, so this isn't really the hassle it might sound like.

It won't surprise you to learn there's also a dungeon system, though it's surprisingly difficult to get started with it. You won't be trawling the pits in your first hour of play. It's relatively fun, though I often found myself needing to head in with mostly empty bags, lest the (questionable!?) treasures looted overwhelm the fairly small bag space. It's fine romping through there, though there's very little variety or interactivity in the depths.  Maybe I was just unlucky, but outside of one or two loot pieces, I didn't find anything much in the dungeons that I couldn't get elsewhere.  It's also frustrating to run out of energy when dungeoning - swinging your sword takes energy like chopping trees or mining rocks - so you literally can't attack when you hit empty. This can lead to running from enemies while trying to eat a carrot, which feels pretty ridiculous. 

This is where some of the game's failings begin to become clear. Like the bag space issues in dungeons, managing inventory and storage boxes becomes a chore in Graveyard Keeper. While you can certainly make storage boxes like in SDV, critically, in GK you can only place them in designated areas. Further, crafting only takes place at specific crafting tables, so you're forever ferrying items from one location to another. It's not all bad - if the boxes in the immediate area hold the crafting items you need, they'll automatically get used (in combination with anything in your backpack) to meet requirements- but you'll still find yourself traipsing across the yard to the church basement or morgue over and over to bring something you didn't think you'd need until a new tech was unlocked. To some degree this is a puzzle of inventory management - but it gets old after a lot of repeated trips. This burden is made all the worse when the game puts incredibly onerous crafting requirements on you - things like refined items several tiers deep that require waiting minutes at a time to forge or cook, or with chance-of-quality crafting that is can mean resources effectively lost.  Oftentimes those materials might be needed in multiple areas at once, or are timegated - so it becomes a sacrifice in your other progression to tunnel vision a specific thing. More than once, I was turned off continuing to play GK, or even loading it up, because I knew that vast crafting requirements awaited me in order to get to The Next Bit. 

One caveat: there is a VERY useful feature in the Teleport Stone - which is unlimited use and very affordable early in the game. It allows you to teleport home and to other key locations with almost no cooldown, and is a boon when crafting , planning or cleaning up loose ends. Still, I can't help but think that the whole crafting thing could've been streamlined or freed up to give more control over the experience. 

The plot is also surprisingly linear once you realise it. Yes, you're free to do as you please - but once you do want to follow the story - it isn't at your own choice of method. At one point I was required to bring an NPC something to progress, except that that required me to give someone else something first, and to do that, you need to help another NPC ...You can see how this gets frustrating. While all NPCs have a rep level, these aren't really progressed by doing them favours or showering them with gifts like you might in SDV. You basically do the story steps and hey presto, your rep increases to just the required level, whaddyaknow? This makes the relationships feel pretty artificial and forced. Similarly, getting bottlenecked from progression because you haven't got the right farming skills is pretty deflating, though it is possible to tunnel vision certain progression when these roadblocks pop up.


While it's fun to explore and learn by doing, certain critical features are left unexplained, and it's easy to progress a long way in some areas while others are entirely left out because you've not stumbled on the right area. The tech and crafting tree are particularly guilty of this - while it does allow you to try and mix and match alchemical reagants at random, you can only do so if you've researched them first . Researching requires Faith from your local church - a currency sorely lacking in the early stages of the game. This discourages research and by extension and experimenting. Successful alchemical experiments do get added to a known recipe list, which is great - but the opportunity cost of doing research is prohibitively expensive and is more likely to send you straight to the game's wiki page instead.

Overall, GK is a fun and new take on the rural life sim. But if you want to do everything it has to offer, be prepared to grind out for significant hours, and to not always be rewarded substantially for your effort.

Several times per character. Sometimes you do a very tedious thing, grind for a while and finally get that item/-s the NPC was asking for. You deliver it and they say maybe one line of dialogue and sometimes you don't even get relationship points for that. I mean, seriously? Maybe it is the dark humour of the game.
It kinda feels like a pay-to-win mobile game without the microtransactions.

Pros:
‣ a nice visual style
‣ I find myself humming along to the in-game music
‣ graveyard upkeeping mechanics
‣ the NPCs will keep your interest, however, there is a BUT. More on that in the cons section.

Cons:
‣ [spoiler]a location that is alluded to all troughout the game and makes you believe that you will visit it DOES NOT EXIST IN GAME.[/spoiler] This makes you feel like an idiot. The game wants you to believe it is larger than it is. Such a scumbaggy thing to do...
‣ the interest I was talking about regarding NPCs... it gets old. After a while you just don't care because they will say a few sentences after you deliver an item and then ask you for more things to help with.
‣ no way to efficiently carry more than one large item (logs, large pieces of stone, iron). Yeah, there are zombies. But to set that up it will take a lot of time.
‣ walking speed is too slow and days/nights are too short.
‣ merchants. Do not sell things in batches, you will lose money that you could otherwise get. Maybe 2-3 items per day. Earning money is really slow in the beginning. Which brings me to the next point...
‣ lots and lots and lots of grinding. Which is why I stopped playing the game because that's all it is. You grind, run around with the Wiki page open all the time. It got old and now feels tiring.
‣ as others have said, there are insufficient instructions about how to make items. You have to use the Wiki page all the time or even Reddit since the Wiki does not even explain everything.
‣ other things, but these are the major ones.

I cannot recommend the game for a full gameplay. It is very interesting in the beginning, but gets frustrating after a while. I truly wanted to like this game – it has so much potential and it's a bit different from Stardew Valley.

» Comment  PROS-CONS «
✅PROS: 
- You always have something to do
- You can do a lot of things, such as building, fishing, building a farm, cooking, and so on.
- You can transport the remaining logs by pushing them to the storage.
- You get dmg when you pick honey, this little detail is not found in some games which makes the game more fascinating.
- Both the sounds in nature and the rest are wonderful except for the stuttering NPC when they talk to you, those are awful.
- Leave traces of what is useful in some cases.
- There is a certain type of unique construction specific to each crafting component that makes the game a little closer to the real world.
- The effects of wind and fog add a certain beauty to the game
- You have personalized warehouses in each work area which is very useful due to the great variety of items.

❌CONS:
- It confuses you and nothing clear is explained to you at first
- When you fish, you pick flowers or dig up the remains of trees ... etc. you do not gain knowledge points.
- There is no upgrade system for the buildings that will have to be advanced, you have to demolish the old ones and then rebuild
- It's a bit strange and confusing because there is no list of recipes for some items, you have to lose a little through the game to discover them for the most part.",1641400714,1641463945,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Graveyard Keeper is a homestead crafting RPG wherein you are a graveyard keeper, sermon giver, farmer, etc. It has a big focus on crafting and the crafting gets progessively more complex as you go through the game. I think the crafting is extremely well done and I love how the upgrades work. I absolutely love crafting games, but I find that a lot of them get boring or say they're a crafting game but then don't actually focus on crafting. This is the best crafting and resource management game I've ever played.

The automation is really fun too, because you don't just upgrade things to automate them, but rather you craft items to turn bodies into zombies and upgrade the zombies and they automate certain tasks for you. It's a neat twist on a classic resource-gathering feature.

The dungeon is great, except the levels don't seem to respawn enemies after you've gone through them, which is unfortunate. I wish I could keep going down there for more items and just for the sake of dungeoning, but I've beat all 15 levels already and there's no respawn so the dungeon is no use anymore.

Overall, I highly recommend Graveyard Keeper, especially if you're looking for a game to sink into and forget everything else exists. I also recommend the DLC. I have 2/3 DLC currently and I will buy the third soon. They add fun extra side quests to the game, but you probably want to play the main game for a bit before adding the DLC so it doesn't get too complicated too quickly.",1641399439,1641399439,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
1) Huge Tech tree to unlock, some are passive, buildings, and more buildings
2) A fairly large map and array of NPC that gave task
3) A 6 day only in-game life cycle ( So you won't be rushing and try to be perfect just to meet every other NPC's request at a specific day of the year (etc. Marry likes christmas, you don't have to wait till 25.12 just to increase her happiness towards you )
4) A lot of things to gather, plant, cut down, mine.. although they are tedious
5) I liked that every now and then, a little progression made give you some rewards upon your effort
6) The tech tree is way better than Everdale, in that game is like Clash of Clans...cuz same devs, so it can take like 5 days just to unlock 1 tech , but here? you can do it , just that you need to know what you're doing

Cons:
1) Map can be more helpful... imagine if there's a player icon, task to do, NPC highlight when you're lost ( the map is not helpful at all)
2) I wished there's a ""Task bar"" like upon discovering a broken bridge, you can keep track at what you need to rebuild it...but that's just for new player
3) I wished the Energy system can be ""Permanently increased"" with something like a ""exp bar"" 
4) Somehow the game feels a little...unfinished?

Here's some tips btw...
1) I don't really care or feel the need to rush to meet NPC's task in the early stage ( i.e Inquisitor's quest, old man at the lighthouse) 
2) Examine the garden table asap, before talking to the Tarvern dude
3) Get them Carrots growwing, eating berries, cooked mushroon, cooked carrot are so good for energy
4) Other than the sword, do not repair any rusty tools with the wheatstone, just trade them in to the blacksmith
5) Get the Teleportation stone from the traven guy asap ( then reach quarry, lighthouse )
6) In order to make use of my money....I prefered to play the game without any DLC, perhaps a whole new playthrough upon getting another DLC

The Early-Mid to Mid-Late game is the meat and potatoes of this game. Early on, it's rough as it's open ended and can be hard to find out where everything is. The late game is more of a grind and I found to be annoying having to pass day after day waiting for one person. 

However, the mechanics of this game more than make up for the UI and early/late game. Nearly everything interconnects and can/will be used to progress through the story. 

The game continues to evolve in ways that feel meaningful and rewarding. Between running the church/graveyard, your own brewery, the vineyard/winery among many other things, you feel like every improvement and research is impactful. Near the end of the game you'll look back and be amazed at all the little shortcuts or improvements that you've made over your playthrough.

There are parts where you must make multiple items that use special ingredients. These are by far the most annoying part of the game. It's not like it's the end of the world, but it's definitely an inconvenience that you cannot fix until you’re able to automate things later on.

The biggest annoyance by far is having to interupt whatever I'm doing to deal with the bodys being dropped off, at least make it so they auto drop to the fridge pallet. As I approached the end of the game, I found it very tedious to try and get through to the correct days for certain events. I found it very annoying when an NPC would tell you to come back in a week when you have nothing else to really do. The quest/npc log should have more detail about what's needed (instead of just Help Ms. Charmy). Could use more character interactions that don't require you to craft items. Some of the crafting can be a bit tedious (craft this to craft that, then you can craft this, then wait a week to give to NPC). More open floor plans would be nice when building crafting stations. It's a bit strange that a level ii crafting station doesn't fully replace level i, in some cases- also that you can't in-place upgrade some is kinda annoying. I'd often forget what resources are required to craft something after leaving to gather the materials, since many of the materials are easy to mix up- various types of wood cuts and metal pieces. The distance of things from your home could be improved, definitely felt like a walking simulator at times. The zombie automations were nice but seem incomplete, they stop short of being automated end to end- you still have to do some work to keep things running smoothly. There's also some bottlenecks with the zombies like the wine/beer making ones that end up with way too many grapes and hops to process if you've maxed out your vineyard and the limit of pallets you can sell per week. I'd would be nice if you could complete the final objective and still be able to play, I know that goes against the story line but something could be figured out. Multiplayer would be nice to add, but not sure how that'd be worked into the game. The framerate issue still should really be looked at. The game has very nice art/lighting effects. I feel that if the devs put in another year or 2 into the game it could go from good to amazing, on the level of Stardew or Terraria. 

Original Review: Only played a little bit but seems fun so far. Framerate issues need to be worked by devs, there's a discussion in the community hub about it. Very close to a recommend but sub 60fps drops on a 2D game is unacceptable on a modern GPU.",1640562462,1641316894,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- ОЧЕНЬ мало сюжета, 90% игры это тупорылый гринд. Да, ты постоянно занят, но лишь тем, что пилишь доски, рубишь деревья, чистишь подземелье, крафтишь гвозди, плавишь железо. Будто всю игру просто после какого-то момента вырезали.
- Подземелья скучные, не динамичные совершенно.
- Детали задания посмотреть по какой-то причине нельзя. Есть размытое ""помочь кому-то там с чем-то там"", а ты уже и забыл, что делать. Подходишь к квестовому персонажу - видишь иконку предмета, которую не можешь идентифицировать.
- Очень много приходится по причине выше гуглить.
- Почему-то лагает порой, не понимаю, в чем дело. В начале игры был неприятный баг: главный герой застрял на месте и не мог двинуться, пришлось перезапускать. Вообще с застреваниями отдельная история.
- Дебильная и дефолтная при этом система услуги за услугу. Ничего в этой игре нет просто так, обязательно тебе нужно нагриндить какого-то говна.
- СЛИШКОМ много крафт-столов всяческих, ну бля, это уже перебор, когда у тебя стоит 20 разных хyевин и ты должен бегать между ними как больной, чтобы сделать какой-то не очень сложный предмет.

There is a well developed tech tree, the are interconnected aspects that kind of force progress, but at the same time you can also buy components from the locals to skirt some of the need to specialize and that's all very well and good. It is an addicting experience and the simple, pleasing tune and the cognitive reinforcement from succeeding through manufacture is a low-key hit of pleasure.

 What the game lacks lay in its depth. In the intro to the game, you're told to speak to someone for help. You find that person and through the entire game there are basically four interactions with that character in a 30-hour play and they just take up space for that entire time. A lot of the NPCs in the game are like that, where they serve as a trading node and whatever backstory they might have is shallow at best.

 Finally, for a game that plays with the macabre, there really is not any impending doom or conflict to worry about. The game is sunshine and rainbows with the occasional corpse sprinkled throughout. There are only two real villains in the game and your character is one of them for all the horrific things they do.

 The game has gotten a few DLC, which is a good thing, but I can't help but feel like the world of the Graveyard Keeper feels kind of empty.",1641236900,1641251287,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Let me start with the positives. I love how the game looks. I also like its dark humor and quirkiness. Thats it.
I dont even know where to start with the negatives...
This is one of the most grindy and convoluted games I have ever seen. In the first few hours I was bombarded with so much quests and things I have to do that it was tough to get going. To get this thing I must first build that thing but in order to build that thing I must build that other thing that requires those materials that I can only get from those other materials which I have no idea how to get.
Well, first I'll walk to town for 5 minutes to check on that npc.. And he's not there cause its wrong day of the week.. Walking back to your place for 5 minutes. Dont let me start on a ridiculusly small inventory space. You can store your stuff in chests, but good luck remembering if you even have those because there is simply too much stuff and its incredibly difficult to keep track of all that.
And then I hear it gets better once everything is in place and game gets going. So, how long until it gets good? Around 20 hours? Nope.
And there are zero hints for any of this in the game. I dont want to read about how to play something, I want to actually play it. If I need to follow a guide for the most basic things in your game, then thats a bad game design. 
So, first hour was kinda new and fun, the rest pure torture and boredom. Sorry, if I'm having zero fun for the first 5 hours I'm not sticking with it.",1641250087,1641250087,False,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

To say something nice, the story is pretty decent and puttering around, as I mentioned, is pretty fun, but eventually you realize it's largely pointless. Many skills, like distilling alcohol, become useless almost the moment you've learned them since they only exist to satisfy one quest. In the base game you can't even sell the stuff! This is true of a number of skills, which ties in with the lack of replayability. Your crafting, farming, etc. are all very much in service of quests to advance the story, and as such once you've done the story there's not much point in doing them again for their own sake. This is in contrast to more open-ended farming/crafting games which allow for more approaches, designs, etc.

There's also a big outstanding bug with zombie porters that'll have you running a long distance many times to try to sort it out. In fact you'll be running a long distance no matter what you do, so get used to spending a good quarter of your time in transit to someplace.

Again, if the grind appeals to you, and to some degree it appeals to me, by all means go ahead. You'll find some rewards here. But for everyone else, I'd say give it a miss.",1641247067,1641247067,False,1,0,0.502946972846984863,0,True,False,False

First this is not a properly working game, to see that there's 3 DLC's avalible without the core mechanics I'm not too happy. 

The major issues that continue to hurt the game: 

I was stuck prepping food for almost an hour because I decided to que up 1000 dough's (there's no way to remove a que) and you can't do anything until your que is completed. 

The UI is non intuitive, meaning good luck knowing how much things cost your characters skills in blueprints. This effects everything in the game, want to know how much resources you need for a quarry? Spend 5 min running to the bp to see what components it needs, spend another 5 running back to get those components, then spend another 5 (15 min total) trying to build a quarry if you don't know the recipe. 

The base game is a grind, the first 4 hours of the game are good, but after that it gets boring. 

Nothing is really explained to you, what are skulls for when prepping a body? How do you make water  (the game says you need a hand station, what the fuck is a hand station?) but you actually need to right click and use on a water pail!? Huh, how does that make sense? There's zero descriptions on any of the tech tree, so you just guess if you need something. It took me 9 hours to find out (after finally looking it up) where to get carbon to make iron ore. 

The inventory is completely broken, have a full inventory and a full chest? Well fuck you, you need to destroy an item to get a slot so you can move shit around. Even consuming food it tedious, right click, move over 10 pixels and ""Use"", try doing that every 3 min for the entirety of the game.
