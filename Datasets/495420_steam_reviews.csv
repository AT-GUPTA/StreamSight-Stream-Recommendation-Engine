The good :
I do enjoy the base building aspects but only in certain spots you can do so and changes can only be done in a specific manner (i.e. your starter base in the bottom of the home has a bedroom, beds in another room, and an even larger room that appears to be the bathroom, but you cannot make any use of it)
Large variety of weapons you can use
Stealth is fun but can't be used on humans, Ferals, or Juggernauts, they can always see you for some reason.
Large maps to explore.

The Bad
Lighting in the game is poor, and the flashlight is subpar at best
While the maps are somewhat large, they can also be very repetitive since there is little variety in each one and it can be tedious to travel around. (for example, another survivor group can be in a house on one playthrough, but they are in a different one on the next time, but the buildings are still the same)
You'll get radio calls from other survivors for help, and they love to be on the opposite side of the map. Often, you can't make it there in time and they take it rather personally.
You can't really affect the environment since it's stationary (for example, you can't board up windows, you can't remove things off the road that are in the way, etc.)

The Ugly
Your companions are dumb as shit. There's no way to sugar coat it. And oddly they have always been that way since I first started playing after it was launched. More often than not they are more of a burden than an asset. Let me give an example that has happened to me more than once. ~After travelling to the other side of the map to assist a group, I run over a toxic bloater that appears out of freaking nowhere (more on that later), car is trashed, I am injured and need plague cure, base isn't too far, I start running for my life back. Running in a zig zag pattern since if you try and run in a straight line while being pursued they will superman launch themselves on your back (picture when Leia Mary Poppins her way back to the starship in The Last Jedi) and proceed to nom nom nom you to death since even with full stamina they can still catch you. Which in itself is annoying because they can be facing me, I'm swinging a weapon at them, and they teleport in back of me and proceed to nom away. Anyway, I make it back to base, I run through the door and pass 4 of my companions then make a b-line for the stash to get the cure I had made ahead of time. While scrolling to the appropriate tab, I'm jumped by the same Zeds that were chasing me and they proceed to nom me to death while the companions I just passed stood there watching it all happen. Not to mention the companions that were posted for defence on the walls. (this was the Red Talon base that was fully upgraded)~
Zeds appearing out of nowhere and in places they cannot get to. I used stealth to clear a house looking for stuff, I go to the livingroom, Check the things that are highlighted, room empty, off of the room is a bathroom, I go there, clear that, on the way back I hear something coming from outside (sounded like a zombie moving), i go back in the livingroom to look out one of the windows and I'm jumped by a plague zombie that was somehow laying on the floor who then proceeds to enjoy me for lunch. There is one entrance to the room, none of the windows are broken, how the hell did you get in there after I cleared it!!?
Another instance of really dumb companions. I go to a radio call, they want me to clear a location and unfortunately want to go. I get close to the spot, I'm using max stealth (I use that skill for all my companions in Nightmare+ diffculty) They are behind me, as I near the door to the medical clinic. The companion with me gets close to a Zed that appears out of nowhere again, they turn to the newest member of the zombie paratrooper brigade and then bang! bang! bang! with their shotgun. For the love of.... I run like hell since waves and waves of zombies are coming. They on the other hand, have other plans. I stop, look back, and return to where we were since they are nowhere to be seen. They are surrounded by zombies and have smartly put the shotgun away and are in the process of trying to fend off hordes of zombies in what could best be explained as a Post Apocalyptic Leeroy Jenkins moment using only a combat knife. I decide to take the L for completing the quest and wait for the failed mission to inevitably appear. Silver lining though, I got to loot their shotgun from their body because some of us know how to be stealthy Becca!!
Game appears to have a hidden video feature called ""crash to desktop frequency"" with the following options :
1 Every 30 min
2 Every hour
3 When I least expect it
4 When you know it will make me absolutely livid

I don't really have any experience with the Multiplayer feature since I live with 2 cats and their game playing skills could best be summed up as lacking. They are there in spirit but not in mind, and are probably marginally better than the in game companion AI.

This is a pretty cool game. It has multiple characters that you can and must switch between that also have management in terms of maintaining their health after damage they take and which type, where also through switching you can go and do different tasks with each one where if a character gets damaged or sustains an injury you can go to the field hospital and until they recover play with an other character which not just is convenient but adds to the suspense and management aspect of the experience.

It has other managerial aspects like ones pertaining to base building and maintenance through gathering ... resources by which you upgrade your settlement and I think gear too. There are outposts that you can reclaim and the game also has some RPG elements relevant to the individual characters like for instance Cardio / Wits / Fighting / Shooting (and specialization in those fields) and a in game radio which you can use actively in game.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3163600872

Gameplay itself is decent like aspects of action that relate to shooting and melee are okay and there are finishers, just as there is a day and night cycle for that extra immersion and scares. Game feels initially a bit clunky and IMHO could use some polish to make the characters feel a bit heavier or just to polish up the gameplay because today we have been spoiled when it comes to some games and how their gameplay plays and feels like, but the responsiveness of movement is good enough. It is obviously a survival game which with management aspects is really cool because I like tinkering like that in my games. Gathering resources, surviving, building a base and expanding it and exploring.

Now as I periodically continue playing I might come back to complement my review like suggestion with other details that I think are somewhat important to mention but I came here to mostly say that the perception of the game for whatever reason to me didn't seem all that great at first since I've known about this game for already a long time but didn't think much of it until now I have tried and I must say that I like it because of the aspects mentioned above. 

Of the more action oriented zombie survival or action games that I've played recently this one takes my fancy and I very like the idea behind it and to a great extent the execution (heh, [i]''execution""[/i]) of this one which again gameplay wise feels a bit basic or ""unpolished"" but the ideas behind it are good as is the gameplay in general kind of sufficient to keep you at it for a bit I would reckon.

It's basically like the Sims only for adults played through the 3rd person and set in a post apocalypse like the Wasteland.",1708282950,1708303733,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you like killing zombies and having a community of survivors working together to survive in the apocalypse, this is the game for you. 

On Xbox I have played this game for years pouring hundreds of hours into it, I was ecstatic to find out it was available on steam as well. I remember when the game released and it did not have nearly as much as it does today (as of Feb. 2024). The team is constantly updating and adding things to keep the game fresh, along with added difficulties to make you really plan and think before you act. 
Instead of having a specific ""character"" you play as, the characters are randomized and their stats are all different. Any given survivor has skills that you improve by doing the particular action, which eventually will evolve into an advanced skill upon growing in proficiency. This is randomized as well, to an extent. The survivors all start with Running, Fighting, Shooting, etc to improve. Then there is a final slot which will either have an interest, such as Driving, or a survival skill, such as Mechanics or Gardening. The randomization of the stats and evolution of what they are proficient in truly make each survivor as different of an individual as any one person in the world. Probably one of the most stand-out parts of this game is the reality of you not knowing who your fellow survivors would be or what they'll be good at. Maybe one of them will be good with bladed weapons and a professional architect. Another might be into Movie-Trivia and Heavy Weapons. Furthermore, every survivor has a ""Hero"" affiliation, so the more that you use this particular survivor, they eventually become the state of ""Hero"". When they reach Hero, they get an added bonus to their traits, and gain the option to become the Leader of the the group, which opens their respective Hero missions. This goes from being a Warlord, to being a Trader or Builder, and more. Additionally, whomever your Leader is will unlock unique base-building options. The versatility is essentially endless. The only thing I would change about this personally, is the addition to make your original starter survivors fully custom to give you the thought of ""this is my family, friends, and/or myself"" instead of being random strangers. 

The first thing you do upon gathering your firsts 3 survivors is finding your first (generic) base. For the most part, all first bases are generally the same. Each map has different layouts and base options (my favorite is the center of Trumbull Valley) each with their own pro's and con's. You gain influence (currency of the game) by doing things from killing hordes of zombies, taking out infestations, completing missions, and much more. To get into bigger and better bases, buy things from traveling traders, and recruit other surviving allies to accompany you on your journey, you need Influence. On top of having your personal base that you choose to build up in your own unique way, you can also claim outposts anywhere on the map (that doesn't have a Plague Heart) that offer your community different bonuses like site-wide power, water, a place to swap survivors while you're out exploring, lots of options as with everything else in this game. 

When it comes down to it, I could go on and on about how much I adore this game, even with all of the bugs and glitches it has had in the past. This series deserves a 10/10, and I am hopeful for a State of Decay 3 in the future. I will absolutely be on the pre-ordering train.

State of Decay 2 immerses players into a post-apocalyptic world overrun by zombies, challenging them to survive, thrive, and build a community amidst the chaos. Developed by Undead Labs and published by Microsoft Studios, this sequel to the popular State of Decay franchise builds upon its predecessor's foundation while introducing new features and improvements.
Gameplay:
The core gameplay revolves around scavenging for resources, managing a group of survivors, and defending against hordes of zombies. Players must make tough decisions regarding resource allocation, base building, and community management, as every choice affects the group's survival. The addition of multiplayer co-op adds an extra layer of depth, allowing players to collaborate with friends or strangers to tackle the challenges of the apocalypse together.
World and Atmosphere:
The game's open-world environment feels dynamic and dangerous, with each area teeming with threats and opportunities. From abandoned towns to rural farmlands, every location offers unique challenges and rewards. The atmosphere is appropriately grim and foreboding, with eerie ambient sounds and detailed environments that enhance the feeling of isolation and vulnerability.
Survivors and Progression:
State of Decay 2 boasts a diverse cast of survivors, each with their own skills, traits, and personalities. Managing these survivors and fostering relationships within the community is key to long-term success. As players progress, they can develop their base, unlock new facilities, and upgrade their survivors' abilities, providing a satisfying sense of progression and customization.
Combat and Action:
Combat in State of Decay 2 is visceral and satisfying, with a variety of weapons and tactics to dispatch the undead threat. Whether stealthily sneaking past zombies or engaging in intense firefights, the game offers a range of playstyles to suit different preferences. The addition of vehicular combat adds an exciting dimension to the action, allowing players to mow down hordes of zombies or make a daring escape when overwhelmed.
Technical Aspects:
While State of Decay 2 delivers an engaging and immersive experience, it's not without its flaws. Some players may encounter technical issues such as frame rate drops, bugs, and occasional glitches. However, frequent updates and patches from the developers have addressed many of these issues over time, improving the overall stability and performance of the game.
Conclusion:
State of Decay 2 successfully captures the essence of survival in a zombie-infested world, offering deep gameplay mechanics, a richly detailed world, and hours of addictive exploration and action. Despite its technical shortcomings, the game remains a compelling choice for fans of the genre, providing countless opportunities for emergent storytelling and cooperative play. Whether braving the apocalypse alone or with friends, State of Decay 2 offers an unforgettable journey through the end of the world.

Really scratched the zombie survival itch I had after watching TWD. Can highly recommend for single player enjoyment! Btw, death is permanent, so play smart and try not to get too attached to your community! No save/reload here!

Pros: 
5 large, unique map/environments.
Easily intuitive gameplay loop * base building mini game.
Diverse bases and 'survivors'.
4 types of community leader to chose from to diversify gameplay.
Difficulty scaling is very good; ease yourself in on lower difficulties, and play harder to have a real challenge!
Tons of unique loot, cosmetics etc that can all be earned in game.
No aggressive MTX loot store.
GTA style driving.
Basic survivor/base/vehicle/weapon maintenance.
Easy to learn, hard to masters. 
Potential for some really memorable gaming moments!
Interesting 'community pool' mechanic where you can essentially level and equip survivors on other maps, send them to your pool and recruit them/use them to get a boost in another higher difficulty map.
Even with decent gear and guns etc, you still have to play smart and not get overwhelmed.

Cons:
Not as complex as other survival games.
Friendly AI kind of sucks (avoid taking them with you on hard missions).
Easy cheese mechanics (drive car, park, stand on top, shoot).
Gameplay loop is quite simple and can get tedious.
Maps are large and tedious to traverse without a car (which are rare/break loads in highest difficulty).
Repetitive missions and minigames. 
Curve isn't too bad, but once you get your biggest base and loads of guns things get much easier.
Will take hours of your life from you!

The game play is solid as ever, but there still are some minor things that tick you off. Like there is no way of unlearning skills, so you can't just forget things and learn new ones. Also the characters still can't climb rocks of any kind.

The thing I like about this game is the how you need survivors with different backgrounds and educations to build your base. Also the weapon handling is in this game is solid. I mean firing a gun and blowing a Z's head is so satisfying. I also both love and hate the inventory system. It is very simple, but it also means that your inventory gets full very fast. Which means you have to empty your bag between every house. Which is realistic if you find a lot of stuff. So take it as you will. The crafting system is also very simple and I can't really complain about it. One hint I can give is that- don't safe your guns and ammo in this game. You'll have plenty of both. Use your weapons. All of them. Same with resources and currency. I haven't had a problem that I'm out of something. Just remember to invest in resource storage in your base.


One main problem is that when you play the main campaign and really start doing quests... As soon as you promote a Leader for your group and start doing those quests, the game just suddenly ends. This game really needs a friend to play with so you two can help each other to clear out the Plague Hearts from the map ( not that they are too hard to clear, just get some distraction, use few explosives and your gold ), establish a base that you want and gather survivors. Playing alone in this game gets old pretty quick. At least after you finish the main campaign ( which happens way too quickly ).

SHORT STORY: How it all went down.
I did the mistake of playing the Sheriff story line and didn't even realize that this final quest would just end my game. I lost one of my vehicles lost my base and had to select if I wanted to continue my Colony, which I did. The map reset, so I basically was forced to start a +Game after completing the main story line. But I wanted to just continue playing the same map.


CONCLUSION!
If you like the zombie genre, SoD2 is a must buy as it's a very entertaining game with maps to explore, lots of zombies to kill, survivors to find and recruit and stories to tell. It's more fun to play with a friend as these games usually are, but I still find myself playing it alone and doing just basic things in it as I do love the game play.",1707463157,1707463157,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I  had great fun in my first playthrough, breaking the plaguehearts and helping my fellow neighbours and survivors. Moving into more expansive base locations and investing in upgrades to help us keep going.
Then I destroyed them all. All that was really left was to move on to the next map. 
I did that, and... I picked a new map. Kept my supplies, survivors, and it was literally just the same task over again.

This game is grossly repetitive with a story that has no conclusion. Maybe it's a statement, but it's unsatisfying. There's nothing to supplement it, if that is what's happening.
There's limited time equipment earned through challenges, 'unique' randomized events, and a multiplayer mode.
This is the wrong format for a roguelike, but it seems to be what they're trying for anyway. 
I would refund this game, if I hadn't gone over the 2hr limit of gameplay. It took me 17 hours to realize that the story was a facade, nothing behind it to follow.

Alas, I cannot, so as a die hard lover of the original State of Decay - I am disappointed with their sequel. Original State of Decay was begging for open world multi-player when it came out. So we have it now - and its okay.  Is good enough??..no, they really did not go as big as they should have with it, considering how badly it was begged for. They made us multiplayer where you are just a host slave.  What we wanted was a big ol' open world map we could ALL play together on. They have added rewards for assisting other players in their game but nothing special. State of Decay One is a little more offensive graphically, but its identical game. The multiplayer is nice but if you dont like being tethered to a host - youll not be missing out if you just get the first game, which is a classic at this point. 

The game play is still very repetitive - it is painstakingly repetitive. i advise to custom set difficulty to LETHAL action, DREAD community, STANDARD resources and turn on aim assist so you have an actual challenge at all. There is not much to break up the soon mundane activity that consists of you searching a home, taking stuff out of draws with a search functions, and taking the supplies you find back to your camp.

No interest in fiddling with how many sticks I have and where this one section of wall should go. Upgrade facilities and designate roles, but no tedium. The open world system is very interesting. High risk, medium reward. Your excursions outward are tough and you have to do a little light planning for them. The sense of danger and discovery out there is real. I can't recall a single other ""zombie"" game where there are actual roaming packs of them that actually roam. I don't like the timed missions that pop up for specific settlers - they are rarely available to take them on (like I've been driving one person for a while, they are tired and injured so I literally have to put them in the infirmary - thus abandoning the mission. Yes, it comes back they say, but this system just adds stress where there need not be any extra). You get constant random radio prompts, sometimes they pop up on the opposite side of the map past TWO plague hearts. I get that its random, but those missions should stay available for at least a couple of in-game days and MUST stay available if you switch out the character to let them rest. That's reasonable and makes sense for the story. Change it now! The curve balls, however, are cool so far.

Fun with a friend. Some mechanics and clunky moments in gameplay can be irritating but overall was a fun time. Maybe I'd play the main game alone, but no way would I play Heartland alone. Since 2.4% of players have the achievement for finishing it (at time of posting this), I don't expect many people to stick with the brutal difficulty in which that DLC offers. The Plague Wall certainly needs to be nerfed in how much of a damage soak they are. Every explosive I could possibly muster and endless amounts of ammo spent to push through, all while fighting off hordes and endless specials. All to get a bland nothing ending was super disappointing. 

Overall I'd give this game a whopping 6/10 for base game. 4/10 for Heartland (mostly due to the end).

There reviews would be better if it just didnt have it.  What drives me crazy, is that there is obviously a much better game here than what we have. I cannot think of a single game more deserving of a triple A treatment than State of Decay.  This isn't to say the game isn't fun, because it absolutely is fun, it just feels like it could be better with a little more money behind it. Its unbelievable that there hasn't been a clone yet.    Its basically, GTA with base building and zombies.  It doesn't waste time with building every little details, like Valheim, or 7 Days, but instead just allows you to furnish and upgrade your base.  This is much more satisfying but after a few play thrus, it does feel a bit limited.  Combat is intense, and exploring is loads of fun.

This is one of those games.

The game mainly revolves around you making your own story. Build up your own community of survivors as you form a base camp. Gather vehicles, guns, munitions, building materials, meds and food.  Don't forget to create outposts and make upgrades as you explore and do quests. Zombies mutate and grow if you don't have a plan to stop them.

Addicting and great fun. Difficulty can be adjusted to your liking so it's not too easy or hard. Has seen lots of improvements especially on the performance side, I remember this game being very empty, buggy and unoptimized at launch. Shame about the way they set up progression for coop play but its still a super solid singleplayer game.

All fluff and filler.
To me it seems like a trick that the opening act will take you roughly 30 minutes for you to experience putting you over the line for a refund, and those 30 minutes are THE ONLY ones with some dialogue and story.


Funny also how there are NO physics objects inside the game besides the car you drive and ragdolling. Wow. 
You can hit a burned out car with a van at utmost speed and it will just not move an inch.
This should put everything into perspective for you.

This is a mediocre, middle of the road, leftover pizza of zombie survival games.
A glorified smartphone game not worthy of any desktop pc.


This is an empty game. 

This is a silent game.

Seriously. 
You pay more than 10 bucks for this consider yourself duped or a moron. 
If you are into this sort of shafting or have always been kinda stupid you will not notice anyways, so go ahead
""Enjoy""

Once you've mastered this game( and its oh so mediocre base building, nearly zero iq npc's) you are not going to experience anything, in it, ever again. 

It is rinse and repeat orgy of ultra low value proportions and the only thing that poses any kind of challenge is the, already mentioned, dementia suffering npc's and nearly ZERO(!) ease of use functions within the INCREDIBLY convoluted and annoying user interface. 

ALL the dialogue has a VERY ""phoned in"" quality. 
It is almost like they wanted this aspect to feel disconnected and shallow.
Quips and jokes that are, obviously, not funny and personal drama exposition told in that forced wholehearted way that makes you cringe and cringe and cringe some more.

i recommend it more to ppl who want challenge sins to them its more fun with higher difficulty, on easy and normal the fun runs out fast cause of lack of freedom and not so good main plot, there should be option where u secure area near ur base and allies start building homes there (take the houses, u move them there, u go and say there is spot for u, even if its not ally yet, after that they become ally for that offer, it gives just 1rank with NPC's) and on each hose they build a sniper tower on top of the roof, so u have small town, imagine the all the fire station are is ur town/area/turf that ends where the bridges are, and when u end there and go ur base remains behind with allies taking it over, u give the base over to allies and u can travel back to old map to trade with this community, and also more enemy bases not just one 


i like freedom like u mark ur turf and then in that border (ofc that has some limitation to, but its more like fallout4 if fallout 4 had option for u to set borders urself, bu u do set down a building workbench that allows u to set the borders) u can build what u want like going in to large city like New York and a area with ferry tall buildings is urs and u build bridges between the buildings from windows and cur off first floor so Z's cant get up and make elevator sys in certain places for 1 floor to get to ground lvl and farms on the roof, in that type of a game there would be endless options what fun builds u could do

The game excels in delivering a true-to-life portrayal of the challenges one faces in a post-apocalyptic world.

What sets State of Decay 2 apart is its commitment to making every choice matter. From resource management to selecting community members, the impact resonates, shaping the fate of your enclave. The constant pressure of scarcity and the looming threat of the undead elevate the strategic depth, keeping players on their toes.

The pinnacle of the game's excellence lies in its settlement management system. The intricate balance of fortifying your base, ensuring resources are sufficient, and maintaining morale creates a dynamic ecosystem. It's a true test of strategic acumen, and the stakes are always high.

While the solo experience is gripping, the cooperative gameplay adds another layer of enjoyment. The synergy required to survive and the shared responsibility of managing the settlement deepen the immersion.

However, a slight downside surfaces in the form of the grind associated with the Daybreak mode. For some players, this aspect might feel repetitive and time-consuming. Nonetheless, it's a minor hiccup in an otherwise stellar game.

In conclusion, State of Decay 2 emerges as the epitome of zombie survival and settlement management. Its immersive gameplay, strategic depth, and the weight of consequential decisions make it a standout title in the genre, offering a gripping solo or cooperative experience.",1705909021,1705909021,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

only down side i see is one zombies just zerg you , you clear one area and leave it for a few sec and they are back .was wonder where they came from and i caught them spawn out of the ground (that what it look like) which was a let down. would think they move from one area to another but guess that was to much to program into the game. another is death is permit if you get a good stats/trait/skills character (you get up to 12 random one for your base which you half to switch out with in game play) they are gone .no do over or reviving.
only other problem i see is it can get repetitive but this is board like game ,you beat the map move on to the next one. also  online play not there unless you have a community of people to play with. the game is friends list or private set but im guessing this is to stop trolls from messing with people. but in all it an ok game.",1655579617,1705811720,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I love survival build based games, so zombie games are naturally within my category of games to enjoy. I was immediately convinced to buy the game the moment my friends were talking about collecting hoodies as well as limited edition hoodies in the game. I exclaimed ""I WANT THEM HOODIES."" I love supporting games and developers so naturally I bought the game as well as the DLC SOUNDTRACK for the game. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I got sucked into the game immediately. There are 3 Game Modes within the game: Campaign, Heartland, and Daybreak. Before playing CO-OP with friends and hop into other friends worlds and them into yours game you do have to play the Campaign mode (which is the main story mode) and build your own community FIRST. Also its Cross-play with XBOX players as long as you have an XBOX ACCOUNT AND THE XBOX APP downloaded on your PC, that way, XBOX friends (Same with Steam Friends) can easily hop into your world and you into theirs. I STREAMED us playing together on TWITCH yesterday. The game is fantastic going solo but even more chaotic fun with Friends! The story, dialogue, and voice acting was amazing, which allowed me to feel more attached to the survivors within my community, especially the first set of duo, that you first pick that has unique duo dynamic story with each other. I love that you can play any and all survivors within your community including the ones that you recruit. After you beat the story for the first time, or even if you don't beat a story mode the first time but still want to make another new campaign you get limited options of characters to choose from, it will become completely random from now on. The soundtrack is awesome. I honestly never heard of ""State of Decay"" until yesterday. Makes me want to buy the first ""State of Decay"" so I can play it.

tldr: the game is a lot of fun with some glaring problems.

Starting the game prompts the player to log in to an Xbox Live account. This alone almost prompted me to return the game. The player must log in, but the box that appears for the log-in freezes all controls on the main menu. Force quitting the game after logging in and then opening the game forces the prompt again. I had to alt-tab into another application to get my cursor back to start the game, then quit, then reopen to solve this issue. After the Initial log in it isnt needed again. (at least not to my experience so far.)

Game Play.
The game itself is amazing and fun. The UI is easy to use on keyboard and controller. Getting headshots on zombies is one of the most satisfying things I have done in any video game and the weapons and weapon-breaking system is a massive improvement over the first game. They added enough new content to keep the game interesting while also bringing back the zombie types of the previous game. That said there are a few issues with the gameplay that don't seem like features but instead make getting places in the game feel infuriating and slow. The zombie spawns seem both localized and like a larger system.

 A player could stealth kill zombies all the way down a street only to find all of those zombies have respawned almost immediately behind them making any level of trying to prepare by clearing an area pointless and also leading to zombie ambushes from areas once thought to house at least a little safety. However one could also see a special infected and that special infected will stay in that area until they are killed yet still have the chance of spawning behind the player in that previously cleared area (mostly just screamers and on occasion hordes, with at least 2 instances of this happening with juggernauts). This can also happen while driving and taking a look at the map with a few occasions driving on the open road to slow down and open the map to hit a bloater that wasnt their previously or ram through a horde.

 Plague hearts and juggernauts seem to have varying healthpoints some plague hearts take up to 10 direct explosives and multiple magazines while some just take a few magazines from a mid-damage weapon. The same goes for the juggernauts taking either a few shotgun reloads or needing to refill ammo after it tanked hundreds of rounds to the face. That isn't to say that defeating either of these isn't extremely rewarding, finally taking them down is a huge shot of dopamine however is frustrating to have to retreat mid-fight because that 200 rounds of ammo and case of explosives you brought for it weren't enough.

 I'd like to talk about mission prompts and quest markers. These are essential in an open-world game where pissing off a group of people can make them hostile and completely change the course of gameplay sometimes don't appear While completeing missions there were times where I was told a mission was failed but before that there was no prompt, marker, or indication it even started. A mission that asked to investigate a cleo drop only to not indicate where that was in the whole map and disappearing, a timed mission prompt to take out a hostile gang only for there to be no map marker. Timed missions without timers so that players cant really prioritize what to do first. one of the most egregious missions being a mutated plague heart that had a 1000 meter perimeter around it that harmed characters while inside it with no real indication of why it was happening with characters continuously saying ""There must be some way to weaken that plague heart."" Only after losing two characters did i get the mission prompt to bring mutated plague samples to one of my allies to find a weakness (RIP Romero, who after he and Josiah nearly died to the plague heart fight went back in alone with explosives and a pistol heroically finished the job losing his life in the process.)

Problems.
While I haven't seen much in terms of glitches I can say that this game crashes a lot. there have been about 10ish crashes and total freezes in my 38 hours of playing the game. most of them being as I left base. a few of them happened as I approached mission objectives and a few were while I had the game paused and was using the bathroom. The crashes are usually at low-intensity moments so it hasn't gotten my characters killed or harmed progress just a frustrating thing to use the bathroom and come back to a frozen game. There are some moments where while driving (both slow and fast) sound will cut and the screen goes black and everything stutters for a moment as if the game wants to crash or it is loading.

All around this is a great game but still has a lot of flaws. I had a lot of fun playing this game as well as its predecessor. I do highly recommend picking up this game next time it is on sale. with that said I do want to talk about the last aspect of the game and tie it in with the previous one.

The endgame.
The game allows the player to pick a leader and this leader has an end goal. That goal is achieved via doing that character's missions and of course ends with a final fight. (I chose the sheriff so the final fight was against a gang wanting to take over the town) That final mission is permanent. However, that is the only part of the prompt that I could read as I freaked out trying to close it as zombies attacked my car that crashed after the pop-up explaining the final mission took away my controls. Essentially, on the way to the final mission, they have a marker that once reached triggers an end game ""point of no return"" screen that comes up without real warning, and doesn't pause the game so if your driving the car will keep moving, and any zombies will still be chasing you. The whole thing is about a paragraph and the options to cancel or continue are press and hold prompts. Why they thought this was a good idea to have on the way to the mission in unsafe areas instead it pausing the game or it being somewhere at your base where someone could read the whole thing is beyond me.  
Now tying it back to the first game, after completing the story the player is given free roam again. the new objective to survive as long as possible, kill zombos, have fun. In this game, The player is given the opportunity to go back into the game with the whole community and the gear and stuff from the previous run but can also choose a new map and starter base. This is so cool and amazing and gives the game so much more content.. If you're ready for it. If you aren't and you can't afford the base size you need then you kinda get stuck with too little room. It isn't much of a problem but it would be nice to be able to go back and prep first.",1704830876,1704830876,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The new update changes that a lot by making it so the moment you are spotted by a heart, a timer looms over you, i also really enjoyed just thrashing about it my dlc car, squashing Zeds and it was ok to do, now having a car is kind of a death sentence unless you want to alert every single plague heart on the map.

As i said it's ok but i really enjoyed the other version way more and now i don't play it at all, so i think new players to it will like it, i just hope with the third game they take into account the overall population of their community's voice and not ignore them and not only listen to those who played on the harder difficulties. 

Even making the infestation update something that only affected the harder difficulties would of been better than losing a lot of players lol.

if you're really into a game that will rush you and make you do things it wants, like managing outposts etc and always having to time manage every moment to get the most from the game without dying constantly then you'll probably like this.

1. Fun and easy to understand survival game.
2. Progression isn't all about farming. Exploring and combat is a big part.
3. This game has sound and sneak mechanics.

CONS

1. You need xbox live or microsoft account to log in and start playing
2. Single player is fun however coop is terrible because you can't do anything alone. You can't explore by your self and have to always follow the host like bunch of ducks. Also you have marked loot for each player that others can't open.
3. Game feels like controler game. Simple storage and inventory systems, ""muddy"" movement with mouse and keyboard.

     The gameplay itself is OK, but leaves a lot to be desired, especially when it comes to limited base/community building. The combat is pretty good though. It gets pretty difficult, even on the lower difficulties. The gameplay does get boring after a while, though, that's a big turn off for most people. Not much of an endgame, and the loop just gets boring.

There isn't really a proper co-op as well; Yeah you can get in a game with someone, but if you're not the host you can't do much other than kill zombies.

The game also forces you to do some Microsoft log in. I don't have a big problem with this because I'm a big Xbox guy but I can see where this can be annoying,

     One thing that warrants my respect is the fact that the game came out in 2018 and still gets updates, even during the confirmed development of state of decay 3. That's awesome.",1704541686,1704541686,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This new Juggernaut Edition adds tons of new content and improvements that make the overall gameplay experience even better.

In terms of visuals, the graphics have been enhanced with better lighting effects, sharper textures, and improved animations. The world feels more vibrant and detailed, from the dense forests to the abandoned towns you'll be scavenging through. Audio wise, the sounds of zombies groaning and ambience noises like wind blowing through the trees further immerse you into the post-apocalyptic setting.

Gameplay is still focused on resource management, base building, recruiting community members, and exploring the open world, but it's deeper than ever. There are more options for base locations now, each with their own benefits. Combat puts an emphasis on stealth and strategy to avoid deadly zombie hordes. There's also a bigger variety of missions that unfold procedurally, keeping things interesting across multiple playthroughs.

The further you progress, the tougher choices you'll have to make to ensure your community survives against the relentless waves of zombies, hostile human enclaves, and dwindling resources. The new difficulty modes offer brand new challenges for veterans of the series looking for a stiffer test of their survival skills. All of this contributes to an addictive, tense and rewarding gameplay loop.

Overall, State of Decay 2: Juggernaut Edition takes what was great about the first game and expands on it tremendously. Both newcomers to the series and returning fans will find plenty to sink their teeth into with its compelling survival sandbox gameplay.

Game crashes and freezes AI/dialog for no apparent reason.   Characters decide to jump off cliffs and injure themselves.  Melee attacks just don't hit sometimes and there doesn't seem to be a way to prep a melee attack, waiting for a zombie to come into range.  Guns are much better in that heads have a large hitbox and zombies are pretty deaf to gunshots.  Not to car horns or the clinking of objects as you rummage around too quickly.

Honestly, I wouldn't have given this a thumbs down except that Steam insists on nagging me, constantly, for reviews.

EDIT 1: I just started a new settlement after the game crashed on my last one.  I went up a billboard tower to scout out the surroundings.  Upon going down the ladder, my character decided to then drop off the edge.  This was a slow process that wouldn't seem to allow me to cancel.  So she dropped, broke her legs, and we don't even have a settlement yet to heal her up.  Great.  The followers with me, they surely wouldn't walk off the cliff after they just saw what happened to her, right?  Yeah, no, time to delete this settlement.  FFS.  Almost a 4 year old game and the jank is this powerful.

EDIT 2: OH FFS!  So I went into manage communities; a nifty way to keep track of the different runs you have going.  I clicked on the one I want to delete, believing this would select the community so that I could click on a button to delete it.  NOPE!  Instantly loaded that community without any warning or confirmation.  Also, why does right click work like the escape button on the keyboard?

EDIT 3: Multiple warnings about deleting a community.  Telling us if we delete the save, then things inside the save will be deleted.  Then forcing us, after we've already told it to be deleted twice, to HOLD the delete key while it yells at us in red text about how stupid we are for deleting this 5 minute old community.

I pretty sure I can get a mod for it, but the only problem I have is storage in vehicles is very tiny even in a pickup truck full of space on the interior with only 1 other person. The largest I saw for trucks was 9 slots and I mostly used the 8 slots truck. I also left a jerry can and repair kit always just in case. definitly a perfect zombie horde looter shooter but the storage just does not make sense. 

Zombie/Infestation Hordes build up a little to fast I've had at least 3 or 4 hordes all just a bunch of screamers and bloaters in 1 hour. They like to take the same property that I have already cleared in just 5 mins. I think its just the heartland story but I find that quite annoying but at the same time right after I get back from a massive raid I do that I just take the time to kill both infestations sites. I also found that they are more likely to go to places that you have discovered (Infestation Hordes).

I got pretty ticked off when I saw that my truck had disappeared when it was in my four vehicles spots wasted an hour to find another 1 just this time red. got lucky with a toolkit near id say about 3 or 4 infestation hordes. As i headed back I fixed up the truck and noticed that my vehicles that were missing were to my left the exact same trucks and items in the back. I was shocked ngl. At least I got the 2 trucks I wanted and made the red truck my main vehicle for transportation.

State of Decay 2 hits the sweet spot for a PvE + Multiplayer Cooperative zombie apocalypse survival game. The game play loop is relatively simple but manages to stay entertaining. There are several different maps to play on, each with their own variety of bases your community can occupy. These bases have a multitude of different building options based on slots available, and most bases have some kind of built-in slots. Each community you play will be different, although you can bring back a few of your favorite past survivors to start a new game if you like. Four different leader archetypes provide options for specific community directions as well. Traders and Sheriffs focus on the broader community of survivors outside your own base, trying to help everybody. Builders and Warlords focus on your own community and being independent. 

The campaign is where I have spent over 40 hours now, which does have a narrative tutorial but after that it's up to you how to proceed with your community. The game generates missions for some of your community survivors which do have a coherent narrative, and the various other groups all have some story behind them. It's enough to make it feel not completely random and pointless without dragging you along in a pre-defined narrative. That said, there is a story-based mode I haven't played yet but it's there if that's your thing. 

There have been a few bugs but they have been very few and far between for me. The only game breaking bug was getting stuck in an open container I couldn't close, had to alt+f4 out. No other incident has forced me to close the game in 40+ hours.

Quests to help neighbours feel like chores, and the nature of the quests does it absolutely no favours (bring us X resource, help us kill a zombie, help us kill a dude). It's not uncommon that a neighbour would ask for a resource, then you loot the very 1st building on their own property, and find that resource they were looking for. WTF are they doing in there all day? Thinking up busy-work to keep you occupied with, and then cry when you don't wait on their every beck and call? 
+ I'll admit, bumping the difficulty up to Dread was fun for a while, I am not even mad that I got stomped (ammo ran out and 1000 infestations set up around my base, R.I.P.). I found it challenging to change how I approach the game to account for the difficulty spike, and this was a relatively rewarding experience, however the monotonous nature of the game inevitably rears its ugly head. 
- The campaign is terribly disappointing. The characters are 1 dimensional, and the campaign is just the base (boring) gameplay with a couple of extra steps. Quincy and Helena shows a glimmer of personality, but the rest are just ""stock personality packs"". There's literally no point in spurning any of the neighbours/characters since they are so 1 dimensional, you don't need to worry whether or not a character might betray or slight you. You just help them, and then they might as well start calling you Jesus from now on lmao.
-- Follower AI is really dumb. I usually just take a follower with to haul extra loot, or to tank zombozos for me, that's it. I also don't understand why you're limited to employing 1 follower at a time, like what's the point of any vehicle with more than 3 seats? Also, though the pick-ups are cool and all, I cannot for the life of me understand why followers always insist on sitting on the back where the wettest of noodles can cling to the car and launch them off with a nanogram of effort.... Why can't I take the entire squad out to deal with a plague heart/wall, or just cruise around and wreck some zombozos? The followers at base are also just utterly useless. All they do is make noise and consume resources, and offer a paltry loot haul every now and then. Also: when I'm looting, they just stand around and look at me. WHY DON'T THEY HELP LOOT? You can't even say they're on point/lookout, since on numerous occasions I would loot while follower just stands around, and a ninja zomb would come up to me and bite me in the dick, just to have them look on in an apathetic stupor exclaiming: ""Watch out, there might be zeds around"", like really? Zombies? In the zombie apocalyptic wasteland? 
-- Inventory management is HELL. 40 bullets take up a slot the same as a god damn GENERATOR? Nah, I'm not buying it. Ammo and equipment could have had different inventory slots. Limiting us to 8 slots (save for loadout and pockets) is HELL. I do not enjoy blowing every single item in my inventory to scratch at a fraction of the plague wall's health, just to tuck my tail between my legs to drive back to base and restock, just to go chip away at another slither of its health-pool again. (Sure, set up an outpost nearby, ye ye, but tell me in all honesty: is this fun and rewarding gameplay? Blow your load, run 10m, restock, come back, and do it again for 20 times? or GOD FORBID you need to drive 2 km back to base because you ran out of this or that?)
-- Don't even get me started on the plague heart/wall triggering mechanic. I could spend 10 minutes clearing out the entire lot around the plague heart/wall, but as soon as I breath on the heart/wall, a million zombies just materialise out of NOWHERE. The plague wall triggering mechanic is AIDS AF: same logic as before, but now Scotty beams a fkn juggernaut and GOD FORBID a feral right on top your face along with 50 of their best friends. Where tf were they like a minute ago? Do zombies in this game tunnel? Nah, this mechanic is stupid at worst - implemented VERY poorly at best, and crafty gameplay is not rewarded.

One could say my expectation of the game experience is too high, but to that I say my disappointment is proportionally high. HARD pass for anybody looking for a rewarding and enriching gameplay experience.",1703974842,1703974842,False,1,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

State of Decay 2 is an open-world zombie survival game from Undead Labs. As a sequel to their 2013 game, SoD2 (released 2018, Juggernaut edition on 2020) takes a lot from its predecessor - sometimes to a fault. However, this also means that everything that made the first one great is here too!

The best: First and foremost, the soundtrack is absolutely gorgeous. State of Decay 2 is a blast to play, which is all you can ask from a game. The graphics make the world look endearing and the FIVE (!!) different maps, together with the progressively more challenging difficulty settings, are enough to keep you coming back. The two DLCs that come with the Juggernaut edition are a fantastic addition to the game, both Heartland adding a deeper story and Daybreak featuring a base defense game mode. Being able to play all of those, as well as the base game, online - with friends or strangers - is a nice feature for those interested.

The bad: Being so similar to the first State of Decay, to the point of having its original map and it being the best one, makes the game feel unoriginal at times. SoD2 is narratively very weak, with basically no plot in the main game whatsoever, and having to go to the DLC to experience some sort of actual storyline feels... weird.

Conclusion: State of Decay 2 is a fun but flawed game. I'd highly recommend its purchase, more so during sale season, while keeping its pros and cons in mind. Its numerous features (base building, community management, world exploration, survival elements...) are guaranteed to keep the player entertained for dozens of hours - and get them ready for the upcoming third State of Decay!",1703865876,1703936996,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There's a good deal about this game that I do like, so credit where it's due.  It does give an interesting spin on the zombie apocalypse as well as some decent base building options.  Combat is interesting, but nothing to write home about.  The graphics are overall pretty good and it does give you a sense of dread, especially when you're scavenging at night.

Now for the bad.

Throw in a generous portion of bugs and half handled AI programming and you get State of Decay 2.

If you're going to get the game, do it when it's discounted as this isn't worth the sticker price.

The game gives each player individual storages to loot, however, player 2 consistently gets much less of them to loot. Leading to them not having as much/as good of gear as the host.
The loot grabbed from the world is individual and is separate between players with the exception of the big bag loot items needed for the communities, with any you deposit as player 2 being donated to the host. This leads player 2 to not be able to craft anything in the community and the host has to do it for them.
This is the massive issue with the multiplayer where is wants you to work together to progress but one player just gets left behind.
Another issue is that (I don't know if this was my game bugging or an intended feature) but I am not able to heal myself over time in the hosts game where I play another character to let the other one heal. I left one character at the base for about 3 in game days and they were still injured.

Multiplayer is annoying as fuck. teathering....its 2024!!!!!!!!!! Host gets 80% loot you get basically nothing. You cant build together, you cant upgrade, some of the features you NEED (treating blood plague) are NOT AVAILABLE for some reason etc...

Its significantly better than the launch state it was in. Its fun, surprisingly deep, and has mechanics that work so well together. Problem is, its still quite glitchy. Talking to characters doesn't always work, models freaking out, physics freaking out, weird stuff happens that feels like the game is seriously broken in some spots, or its a charming jank (sometimes). It happens just often enough that it needs serious addressing from the Devs. I keep running into glitchs that end a session, and due to the way quests work, that quest is now gone until it randomly pops up again next session. At that point I want to move on to something else than deal with this frustration after an hour session. The curveball system is so brilliant, adds such emergent gameplay variation to the overall gameplay loop it keeps it pretty fresh. That feels like something all zombie games should have. Inventory managemant is a pain in the ass. Im a loot goblin and I cant help myself grabbing everything I can. I seriously wish a small vial of plague cure doesnt take up the same amount of room as a portable generator - there needs to be more variation in loot size, weight isnt enough for this style of system.  I run into inventory management issues enough that if I dont have an extra survivor with me its a serious drag. Maybe higher difficulties use this to its fullest, but my example is still valid for loot size differences. SoD3 needs to seriously overhaul inventory management in a game thats like 80% looting. Even a truck, it should be able to store an intense amount of stuff but its only 4 extra slots, which is huge but feels like its not right.

It's a great game aside from that issue.

One of the possibilities is to transfer your community to another map, but there the main thing is clearing hearts and then it’s not clear what to do. There are two modes - Heartland (plot) and Daysbreak (holding positions from zombies), which you can also play for a couple of hours and that’s it.

Bunch of new additions are game play factors that are just annoying.

Great game to play with friends !

I suggest installing mods to enhance gameplay experience. There, MODDERS have added fog, ability to have a group of 4 OR MORE PEOPLE, no special infected mode, realism, enhanced graphics, A SNOW MAP, more car inventory space, proper working outposts with better benefits- the list goes on!

Genre: Survival, Horror, Storage Management
Platform: PC Windows

[TL;DR] Must-Knows:

Visually stunning/unique:
It definitely has good visuals, but there is always room for improvement

Immersive audio and soundtrack:
Yes, when the music pops off - it definitely immerses you into the environment right away.

Engaging story/narrative:
The premise is to build a community, loot and discover new places that would benefit you and your community. You will encounter others who need help and would become allies or enemies. It is up to you to decide. There isn't a huge story line behind people just trying to survive. 

Gameplay mechanics:
The fighting mechanics can be clunky but not too noticeable. Walking, running, looting, entering cars and home through doors or windows have been smooth. Driving is super fun in this game. I typically go for off road trucks to get to places faster and run over a ton more zombies.

Responsive and intuitive controls:
Very responsive to keyboard commands. I believe you should be able to use a controller with this so that makes it good for those users as well.

Challenging but fair difficulty:
It can be quite challenging depending on your difficulty due to storage management demand, community demand, etc. However, playing it on the easiest mode is not tedious and does allow you to get accustom to building and other things so when you are ready for more, just go to your settings page while in the current map and community, then boost up that difficulty and good luck! 

Plenty of content to keep you playing:
Loads of things to do, but it can get slightly redundant after a while but the character switch does help shift that perspective. It is one of those things where you are the music maker and the dreamer of dreams. DO WHAT YOU WANT :) 

Runs well/optimized for your system:
Yes, it doesn't take much to run this game.

Few/no game-breaking bugs:
No bugs or anything encountered so far.",1604294471,1702665181,True,4,0,0.541666686534881592,0,True,False,False

It also can be very frustrating when you lose a character due to derp AI. I am a huge fan of permadeath strategic games that punish you for wrong moves. I am not a fan of going into a room, getting a camera full of wall and having my character nearly die before I can get vision on what is actually there. Controls can be a bit wonky as well. Hitting the button to climb on top of a van to get a momentary break from fighting a horde and watching your character jump up and down instead can be infuriating. There is much to love about this game, but the lack of polish this long after release is a big downside.

The beginning of the game can be great., Scavenge, kill zombies, recruit people and start to meet the neighbors. The problem is, there is little else. Zombies respawn infinitely around you, so clearing an area is pretty much useless. Plague Hearts, in my opinion, are just not fun at all to deal with. It does not matter if you spent hours killing every zombie within 69 miles of the plague heart, the second you injure it, a pack spawns right outside the building and come rushing in. Strategy has no place here, unless you consider leaving a vehicle right outside a window so you can climb on top of it strategy. Really just bring explosives, blow up the heart, and gtfo before the horde spawns on your head is the only logical way of dealing with these. The end game is boring and offers little beyond your leaders story and killing plague hearts. 

 If they added some sort of depth to the endgame, tightened the controls, and had persistent zombies who roamed around the map chasing noise and activity this would be such a good game. As it is, it can be fun, but as is it is mediocre at best.

The good side is that the devs continue to update and add to this game. The bad, the things they add are not always fun. I recently gave this game another go to see what all had changed. Unfortunately, its just more of the same. Honestly the best strategy to this game, on hard difficulty settings at least,  is to rush all the plague hearts in the first week of game time and end it before it can scale up. I love difficult games, but I like fun difficult, not spawn super plague heart infused, black plague heart buffed hordes on my head over and over again difficult.

A big step up from the previous title, it's decent for what its trying to accomplish, but State of Decay 2 doesn't quite nail the [b]multiplayer[/b] component and it's systems, while alright, not customizable or deep enough for someone really wanting to bite in. I understand the devs' vision but I think a player-first approach would've been more fun.

And by that I mean allowing full player customization, character creation, free base building and not limited to ""squares open in a homebase"", ability to choose any spot/house as home base, and a fully customizable custom difficulty (instead of 3 sliders for zombies, supplies, survivors). There might be more complaints but this is all I can currently think of writing.

Multiplayer works with host-only progress and all joining the host can only kill zombies, and help grab [b]some[/b] loot. After sessions, returning to your main-host base you receive small rewards based on your multiplayer sessions. This causes extreme boredom for anyone not the host, my brother who plays with me, does essentially one-note gameplay of slaying zombies and looting the 2/7 chests color coded for him. He can't recruit new survivors for his base/save, rest up his survivors in my infirmary, or use any of my survivors. I understand trolls may be a reason for these restrictions, but they could've allowed for host options that deny-allowed certain aspects.

The gameplay itself, is mostly good, the thirdperson gameplay (and this is my complete personal bias) would've been more exciting had the gunplay been incorporated in a more Resident Evil way; but the melee combat would probably suffer from doing it that way because the melee combat is ok, just being a bit janky with swings sometimes missing zeds despite clearly hitting. It's fine, mostly.

Music is good, the game is ugly (especially so if you focus in), the writing is a bit hit and miss, the sandbox is also a bit shallow (ESPECIALLY SO on lower difficulties), Microsoft sign-in is a complete plague, and [b]I haven't played the other gamemodes other than the first one but I can't imagine the quality changes too much[/b] apart from some surprises in the storymode.

Not a bad game, maybe for someone starved for an OK zombie survival sim, but I wish it was better. Here's hoping for State of Decay 3.",1701784056,1701784056,False,1,0,0.502583980560302734,0,True,False,False

- Addicting and fun gameplay loop
- Extremely fun and challenging lethal difficulty
- Extremely fun with you and 1-3 friends in a multiplayer session
- Survivor skills and traits 
- Permadeath increases stakes especially on higher difficulty making many situations intense
- Fun progression system, nothing special but gets the job done
- Frequent innovative updates since 2018
- Xbox crossplay

| What I Don't Like |
- Can be repetitive after long hours
- At times too much going on at once
- Grind to keep grinding
- Voice acting can be mixed

While I recommend the game, it is a [b] very weak recommendation [/b]. Only buy on sale when you're craving some mindless zombie genre fun.

Pros:
- Maps are relatively decent, pretty nice variety between them for the most part
- Difficulty actually matters, the higher difficulties are punishing but if you can survive it makes it much more rewarding
- Looting actually matters, don't have food? People will get very unhappy at the base and quickly. No ammo? Better hope that crowbar is durable to last while you scrounge for more ammo
- Graphics are okay at best

Cons:
- ""Story"" elements aren't really fleshed out that well. While you're probably not buying the game for the story, don't expect anything more than C level zombie flick writing.
- Characters say the same 10 or so lines with the same 4-5 voice actors
- Zombie variety is nice at first, but quickly wears on you after your first play-through
- The AI isn't very intelligent in the game, pretty easy to have a follower get themselves killed by doing asinine tasks

You can replay maps forever and everytime you can aproach things differently. The game let's you decide what to do, and what missions to prioritize. Combat malee/weapons feels great, i really enjoyed killing zombies :D 

After 4 maps. 2 standard and 2 dread, i'm playing the 5th now on nightmare and i can say it's a bit of a challenge but in a very good way. You need to plan more, and play more serious and tactical or the triple plague feral will make you cry :)))) I think dread its perfect for casual players and nightmare/lethal if you want to feel the real game. But first you need to play 1-2 maps in standard to learn the mechanics :P

I have only one complain and that is zombie types. But it's not the end of the world because when you get surrounded by 2 hordes, 3 screamers, 2 bloaters and 3 ferals you are fked anyway and you don't feel like there should be another type of zombie :))) so i guess it's ok.

Waiting multiple IRL weeks to get certain skill books, constantly spawning hordes and infestations right after you've cleared them,  RNG traits, RNG skills, no consistency on character builds.

The combat is fun at lower difficulties but apocalypse or lethal its a chore, any noise = horde.

I don't know why they decided to make traders locked behind REAL LIFE TIME when the game has no real life economy. They are trying to artificially extend playtime with annoying mechanics.

They clearly don't listen to the community because this has been asked for OVER AND OVER, to the point where they have actually created programs to artificially edit your survivors in game traits.

waiting an entire weekend for only ONE trader to spawn with ONE item is just plain stupid game development for anything other than a game chalk full of micro transactions.

The game builds on the foundation of its predecessor, introducing new features and cooperative multiplayer while grappling with some persistent issues.

One of State of Decay 2's strengths lies in its emphasis on community building and resource management. Players are tasked with establishing and maintaining a group of survivors, each with their unique skills, as they navigate a world teeming with the undead. The procedural generation of characters and the complexity of base management add a layer of depth to the survival mechanics.

The cooperative multiplayer, allowing players to join forces in the struggle for survival, is a welcome addition. Collaborative efforts to scavenge resources, defend against zombie hordes, and explore the expansive map enhance the social dynamics of the game. The sense of shared responsibility fosters a unique multiplayer experience within the survival genre.

However, State of Decay 2 is not without its flaws. The graphics, while serviceable, can feel dated, and the animations occasionally lack polish. The game also suffers from technical issues, including occasional frame rate drops and glitches, which can detract from the overall immersion.

Combat, a crucial aspect of the game, can be both satisfying and frustrating. While the variety of weapons and the visceral nature of zombie encounters provide moments of intensity, the melee combat mechanics can feel clunky at times, impacting the overall fluidity of the experience.

Despite these drawbacks, State of Decay 2 succeeds in creating a tense and atmospheric survival setting. The ever-present threat of zombie hordes and the need to make difficult decisions for the survival of the community contribute to a sense of urgency and immersion. The developers' commitment to post-launch support and updates also demonstrates an ongoing effort to refine and expand the game.

In conclusion, State of Decay 2 offers a satisfying survival experience with a focus on community dynamics and cooperative play. While technical issues and some rough edges persist, the game manages to capture the essence of surviving in a zombie-infested world, making it a notable choice for fans of the survival genre.",1701107018,1701107018,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

They're still updating and releasing new free content for this game. On one hand, that is great. But, on the other hand, most of the new content is making the game more busy and more difficult.

You can still adjust sliders to tune the difficulty and how busy you want your experience, to a degree. But, I get the feeling the game is being pushed more towards a ""better with friends experience"" as opposed to just playing solo.

That might not sound like a bad idea.. But, the games implementation is not a ""fully fledged co-op experience"", more it is only a ""friend can drop in and out"" to help you for a while.


[h1]Updated: Dec 2021[/h1]
All the updates, fixes, additions over the years have truly made this game something special. Even after all my hours and with my current survivor community passing day 50 I still find the game interesting. Coming across new weapons, vehicles, and finding out of the way locations.

Collecting the bounties that get swapped around on a per monthly basis is a game in of itself.  So, the longevity is almost limitless.

In a few ways, it reminds me of Fallout, especially the base maintenance mechanic where you have to keep the base stocked up on resources that either can deplete or be passively earned by acquiring outposts. Combat is really good, however you can easily get swarmed, especially if you're trying to tackle Plague Hearts (which are your main objective in the story-line). You're able to recruit people to your community, take control of any member in your community, and locate friendly survivors, as well as kill them. Survivors located usually will have some side quests for you to do from time to time to keep you busy, and ""Curveballs"" keep things interesting by either lowering the difficulty as a benefit, or increasing the difficulty to pose a challenge.

TL;DR: would totally recommend this game, the Campaign is definitely worth the $29.99 asking price and your time in single-player, just be careful of host-guest tethers if you play co-op, this game doesn't allow much in the way of free-roam: performance reasons...",1701075435,1701075435,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I must say it was overall a pleasant surprise. It lost some of the ancestors' legacy, but it ended up as a decent game after all anyway.

I'm not a big fan of ""live gaming"" where you are required to log in through another service (Microsoft live account in this case) or you are denied access completely, no matter if you paid for the game already. This is not right and should stop already, however, this is a good survival game, decently dynamic to keep you entertained for hours, until you finally get bored by repetitive scenarios, yet they still might play a bit differently from your previous experience.

There is no plot, you just survive with your mates and mates sometimes die, so don't focus on developing just one character in your group of survivors. Play as you feel like it, there really are not many restrictions to force you to do something you don't like.
The quests are mostly not very interesting, nor rewarding but you gotta do them to unlock more of the content. It's a stealth/survival semi-strategy combat-focused game as the main genre, so until you stop having fun killing stuff and collecting sh*t you will be having a blast. Stealth is overall working, but even without specialization the Z's basically will not see you unless you go stealth in front of them directly, you can pass through the middle of the herd just by being crouched which is pretty disappointing.

Gameplay loop is stupidly simple. You start with a few guys and you control them one at a time, scavenge for stuff, do some randomly assigned missions, bring stuff/people home to grow your community, and then switch out for a different guy when your current character gets tired.. also there's zombies and co-op.

The lack of story compared to SOD1 makes it seem more like a story generator ala Rimworld if anything.. which i guess is 2 steps forward, 1 step back for most people. Eventually your people get overpowered, clear out the current map, run out of stuff to do, and then you reroll some new guys to maybe start out on a different map.. again, like Rimworld.

Some people can find that it gets repetitive pretty quickly, but if you're not one those people, you'll absolutely love this game.

Technically the gameplay itself is geared towards singleplayer most of the time, however with the addition of multiplayer coop implemented, the game get slightly boosted in the fun factor, maybe, perhaps, not sure....

Other reviews already stated the mechanic gameplay of this game so I'm just gonna sum up my total encounter of quirks and bugs I've found so far in game:

COOP
1. Currently have encountered at least once sudden disappearance of zombies, both on screen and map, though the bug consistency between host and client differ: Sometimes he sees it in his map but not in my map, other time it's vice versa.
2. Server latency can suddenly lag for a bit, sometimes resulting in the client getting kicked out from the host world leaving them to fend of hordes and getting massacred if they didn't manage to get away in time. I can verify that the host experienced that sudden lag the same time as I did in-game so it was most likely not a connection issue.
*EDIT*
3. Well look at that, you can find invisible zombies lurking around where ONLY the host can see it, imagine that when encountering the next invisible plague juggernaut (none so far, too bad).
4. Some achievement are broken as it doesn't register even after doing the said task like Human Contact (play Daybreak coop games with other living person). This is most stressful as this part of the game is the most important (for me) thing!
5. Game have frequently disconnect me when playing on others' world nowadays, that was after the recent 60MB update me think.


SOLO *EDIT*
1. .... eh, it's fun I guess.
2. Trying to win Lethal mode is more down to having enough firepower and luck when it comes to dealing with the Plague Heart (I'm still trying to win at least 1 time, or maybe 4 times just for that damn achievement).


Overall I just hope I won't encounter any game breaking bugs or just literally get screwed by XBOX Live issue like those others that encountered it, that could really change one review to another form somehow *cautious stares to the unknown*

*EDIT*
At this review time the game had been consistently updated to keep the game somewhat fresh, with the introduction of new bounties in each cycles and new difficulty scale setting to tailor to your own taste. Not much can be commented for co-op/multiplayer side of thing since haven't tried to play it with others after my last review update, but overall the game is stable enough to enjoy while it last....

*LATEST EDIT*
So this game has new thing added in every game session called Curveball now, which added additional buff or debuff kind of thing for certain duration that you either can take advantage of or try to avoid as much as possible....",1584502282,1700982143,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The huge draw for this game, for me, is the plague heart system or siege system. The map is covered in plague hearts, and if you alert them from killing zombies in their territory or making a lot of noise, they will awaken. Once awoken, they send out infesting hordes to capture sites surrounding them. Their goal is to locate your base, and when found they will start setting up siege infestations at sites surrounding your base. If these particular siege infestations get too severe, (from hordes reaching it and adding to its zombie population) they begin sending siege hordes to attack your base. Watching hordes act this way gives a sense of urgency to act and stop their spread. Destroying the plague hearts stops them spreading altogether in that area. It's a great mechanic, and sets this apart from other games.

Only one major complaint. The base building isn't as in depth as I wish it was, it's a little too simple. But it does force you to make tough decisions on how to allocate the space you have. You can't really personalize your base, you just pick what facilities it has. Which is fine, but I feel if you could personalize the little details and actually build whole sections or even expand your base, it would make the game a lot more enjoyable.

The main game mode doesn't focus on a narrative campaign, just many little side missions to do along the way. But there is a 10 hour long separate campaign mode you can play. I haven't tried it out yet though. There's also a siege defense mode where you just defend against waves of hordes.

a solid  9 / 10  - this is what cocaine addiction must feel like.

only thing that can compare to this is Days Gone, but only in the graphics and technical department. Days Gone is mainly story driven, while this is more sandbox open world.
SoD2 has great replay-ability, tons of survivor variations and customisation.
Since the recent updates you can hop on to another map with your entire group of survivors and / or retire a single veteran survivor and call them into a new save game. 

CONS :
bullets are scan-line except the crossbow bolts which drops to gravity. 
This is the major factor that makes this game feel more arcade than sim. 
( Hope the devs take real bullet physics into State of Decay 3 still in development. )
Guns are not really customise-able besides attach muzzle brakes and suppressors.
( unless you mod the game with Community Editor )
Only some UI menu glitches ...also zombies can spawn inside rocks and roof tops.
With new updates comes new bugs, but nothing major or game-breaking.

Update:
the Devs have updated this game continuously since launch, adding new functionality and gameplay mechanics. For their continued effort I'd give this game a final score of 9.4 / 10",1625735245,1700863196,True,3,0,0.542990922927856445,0,True,False,False

The Juggernaut Edition breathes new life into the State of Decay 2, offering improved graphics, diverse game modes, and a never-ending zombie survival experience. The absence of a traditional ending makes it hard to pinpoint the time to beat. Estimating playtime is subjective, but a realistic range could be anywhere from 80 to 150 hours for a more casual engagement, 300 to 500 hours for a moderate level of interest, and potentially up to 800 or more hours for those deeply engaged in the game. The duration will vary based on individual preferences and how compelling players find the overall experience.

[h1][b]Gameplay[/b][/h1]
[b]Rating: 15/20[/b]

One of the standout features is its focus on community building and resource management. Players establish and maintain a base, recruit survivors, and ensure the survival of their community in the face of the relentless zombie hordes. The game seamlessly blends action, strategy, and simulation, creating an immersive and engaging experience. The heart of the game lies in its dynamic and interconnected systems. Unique skills, traits, and personalities of survivors influence how they contribute to the community. Balancing the needs of the survivors, managing resources such as food, medicine, and ammunition, and making tough decisions when faced with moral dilemmas add complexity to the gameplay. This strategic depth keeps players invested in the fate of their virtual community.

One of the most significant challenges for newcomers is the various types of ""super-zombies,"" including Screamers, Juggernauts, Ferals, and many other massive and challenging zombie adversaries that the players discover and learn about as they get to know the game. Dealing with these hulking monstrosities requires careful planning and a well-equipped group of survivors at higher difficulty levels, adding an extra layer of challenge to the already intense gameplay for those who like a challenge. However, lower difficulty levels and the specific difficulty sliders let the players tailor their experience. The game offers both cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes, allowing players to team up with friends to tackle the challenges of the apocalypse. Cooperative play enhances the game's community-building aspect, while the competitive portion introduces a new dynamic to the survival experience.

[b]Rating: 15/20[/b]

Visually, State of Decay 2: Juggernaut Edition sees a notable upgrade over the original. Unreal Engine 4 powered enhanced graphics, this modern engine contributes to a more immersive and detailed world. From the run-down buildings to the gruesome zombies, the game's aesthetics capture the grim atmosphere of a world devastated by the undead. The improved lighting and environmental effects also add to the overall visual appeal. Accompanying the improved visuals is an admirable sound design. The groans of zombies, the creaking of abandoned structures, and the occasional distant gunfire create a tense and ominous ambiance. The soundtrack complements the game's mood, punctuating moments of action and providing a fitting backdrop to the desolate landscapes.

However, the engine-specific limitations become apparent while traversing the world. The zombie types are not vast, and the characters you play with and meet look very similar. There's still much variation in what you see in the world and is nothing to worry about. There's a good variety of maps to pick from, with each map boasting unique landscapes and vistas to make things fresh when transferring a community from one map to another or when a specific map becomes monotone. One of these engine limitations is that you can only acquire a single follower to help you with your tasks. Other examples include only a limited number of survivors rendered in the community, with the rest loading in accordingly as you switch between them, the render distance limitations, lengthy loading times, performance stability issues, etc.

[h1][b]Story[/b][/h1]
[b]Rating: 15/20[/b]

The heart of State of Decay 2 lies in the so-called Standard Zone, providing the ideal community-based gameplay experience. Here, players must navigate the challenges of a zombie-infested open world, managing a group of survivors, establishing a base, and securing resources for the community's survival. In Daybreak mode, players join forces as Red Talon soldiers to defend a facility against waves of increasingly challenging zombies. Daybreak introduces a separate currency, prestige, which players earn and use to unlock valuable items for use in the main game. It's a thrilling departure from the standard community gameplay, offering a focused and intense cooperative challenge that only lasts for a single session without lasting consequences.

Heartland introduces a compelling narrative-driven experience to the State of Decay 2 universe. This mode unfolds in a unique map with distinct characters, providing a more structured storyline. Players embark on a journey to discover the secrets of Trumbull Valley, encountering new challenges and characters along the way. Heartland injects fresh life into the game, offering a different perspective and a more guided narrative for those who crave a story-centric experience. The characters in Heartland have their fundamental backstories and feel like real people compared to less important community members, who are just a number in the community simulation portion of the game. Still, I wouldn't consider this as a proper story mode but it does keep the interest.

[h1][b]Technicalities[/b][/h1]
[b]Rating: 10/20[/b]

There are quite a few technical quirks with the game. Based on the Unreal Engine 4, performance issues found among other games built with this engine are present here. Whether you installed the game on HDD or SSD, traversal stutter and frame-time hiccups persist. Some maps are more stable than others, and strategically picking a map can significantly improve the stability and fluidity of the game. While UE4 boasts many strengths, the consistent stuttering isn't merely a minor inconvenience but a persistent presence. Fortunately, technologies like G-Sync prove helpful in relieving smaller stutters, but significant ones remain glaringly obvious. With each and every zombie and NPC constantly simulated, and due to the engine's single-threaded nature, the strain on the CPU is super high, making this game one of the most CPU-limited games you'll ever play, as the CPU must keep up with various complex simulations. Expect a lot of FPS fluctuations.

The online gameplay experience is far from seamless and often falls into the realm of frustration. Connectivity issues are evident in the Daybreak mode especially, which becomes a challenging endeavor when played online unless you're the host or in close proximity to the host, as the game's matchmaking doesn't consider the distance between the players, often matchmaking people from various locations on the planet with each other, creating a cluster of super high ping where everyone's flying around, and player inputs get delayed by seconds. Thankfully, this occurrence is rare, but depending on the region, one might have a better or worse experience.

I loved the 1st State of Decay because I got drawn into its apocalyptic atmosphere and its relatively straightforward gameplay that was very well-balanced.

SoD2 is bigger, more varied, with better visuals, but it lost a bit of its ancestor appeal. It's still a good adventure, and it's hard to pinpoint exactly what's missing. Maybe it's a bit less oppressive and dark. Maybe it's a bit more mechanical and less organic in the progression and missions. Maybe it pushed too much on the irrealism and it broke my suspension of disbelief.

Thus said, I still had quite a good time with it during my 70 hours.

I did 2 runs and the ""Story"" addon.

For my 1st run, I picked the difficulty 2 out of 5 ( = ""Standard"") as recommended by the game for newcomers. I was a bit overwhelmed by the learning curve at 1st, but after ~10 hours, everything became way too easy and I was impatient to beat the map. For example, the ""hordes"" of zombies often had... 3 zombies in them ! >_<

For my 2nd run, I picked difficulty 3 out 5 ( = ""Dread"") and despite being still a bit too easy 90% of the time, it puts decent pressure on me, without being too stressful or annoying.

From their description, the levels of difficulty 4 & 5 just looked like horrible chores by making the gameplay very slow and unfun by making the combat too dangerous (and thus you have to avoid it). I've seen some people enjoying it, though, so your mileage may vary. :-)

The main beef I had gameplay-wise was the main goal : you have to destroy all plague hearts on the map to beat it ( = the source of the plague). In difficulty 2, there are already 10 of them, and in 3, there are 13. That made the game feel too repetitive. It'd have been better to have way fewer of them, but made them a bit more difficult & interesting to attack & destroy.

The story mode, called ""Heartland"", doesn't actually have much of a story, so I was disappointed. However, it offers a few new things and some slightly different gameplay tuning and the ride wasn't bad.

A quick tip : take the cop & the ex-convict for the story mode, as the ex-convict can craft a badass machinegun that will greatly help you to beat the map without being too much of a hassle.

I saved scummed (by copying the files on my HD) to avoid losing my team members. I think this is mandatory because it requires a bit of practice to handle the most dangerous zombies and without reloading it'd mean losing hours of game time for 20 seconds of violent unexpected riping... ;-)

[h1]💖 Pros 💖[/h1]
- Decent variety of small missions (more than in SoD1)
- The special zombies are interesting
- The base construction is straightforward enough but still requires a bit of planning & management
- Each character has a unique ability and you have to plan how to use it, and how to build your team to get the best abilities for your goals
- Quite a decent arsenal, bringing interesting gameplay variations & management
- The game is still actively worked on
- Curveballs : they added that in the last couple of months, and I'd have been quickly bored to death without them ; they are random events, temporarily making the zombies stronger or more dangerous, or even giving you some beneficial effects ; they bring variety in a game that direly needed it

[h1]💀 Cons 💀[/h1]
- Most of the management rules are totally unrealistic and an immersion breaker
- The zombie respawn rate is insane : you can literally looks in a direction, see no one, then look back, then look front again, and get a couple of new zombies ; in most situations, this makes cleaning up a zone totally pointless (except in buildings where the respawn is disabled once you have visited everything -- unrealistic again)
- Your companions are often useless, especially when a zombie is chowing you hard
- Barely any story, even in the story-mode addon
- No difficulty option in the story mode ; overall, it's very close to 3 out of 5, with a few things set on 2 and a few other ones set on 4
- The SOD1 beeping grenade from SoD1 that could blow up 10+ zombies at once is only available at a high cost ; this was likely the most fun thing from SoD1 : you could do great zombie fireworks, while requiring a bit of skill to achieve


[h1]🤔 Technical Notes 🤔[/h1]
I got a lot of framerate issues with the game (it was unstable, or low without the GPU being at 100%), but maybe it was because of the drivers of my Radeon 6800 XT that don't like the Unreal Engine 4.

Hours Clocked: 524.2 (Original Review at 164.0 Hours)

I enjoy open world zombie survival games but many feel so similar that having one stand out becomes harder and harder to find. SoD2:JE is one that stands out.

Familiar mechanics like base building, food, water and skill trees make the usual appearance. Unlike similar games, rather than focus on micromanaging such things, you have a daily count of materials you expend. For quick bursts of stamina you can eat snacks, but otherwise food is more of a strategic resource.

This also ties into base building and another mechanic, outposts. Want to up your daily food production? Claim a restaurant and it provides a boost daily. Building your base in predefined slots might make the more creative builder types unhappy, but there is still plenty of customization to tailor your community to your liking and play style.

This ties into another mechanic, leadership. Electing a leader not only provides perks and drives the story forward, but certain leaders have unique improvements to suit the roles of Builder, Sheriff, Warlord and Trader.

As for the members of your community, you can dismiss them, recruit them and most importantly, switch between them. Why would you need to do this? Rather than make you lose time sleeping, or have down time because of injury or infection, you can swap between members of your community. This means not only do you skip downtime, but each member can be built to meet needs.

Some problems with this can be members that are flat out bad (stat wise), trouble makers, and other liabilities. What kind of liabilities? For starters, death is permanent so if one get infected and turns? Yeah, you're going to have to shoot them (mercy kill), exile them, find a cure, or just hope they don't turn. 

As for the main game play, you will find yourself scavenging for loot, completing missions both for yourself and community members, as well as missions from other settlements. Tasks like supply runs, maybe some backstory/lore missions, infestation clearing, etc.

There are lots of ways to go about killing zeds too. From swords to machine guns, there is a weapon to fit every play style. Of course the zeds won't go easy on you, but with several difficulty levels, you can have a cozy Shaun of the Dead game, or a World War Z game where every encounter can get out of hand.

Overall recommendation is that I recommend State of Decay 2:Juggernaut Edition.

Update Comments: Still one of the best Zombie Games out there.

This is one of the games that I most enjoy playing nowadays. I have about 400 hours of gameplay at the moment of this review.
I initially bought it on Microsoft Store but bought again on Steam on a sale. :D
I am still playing it at the time of this review to get 100% achievements as I do enjoy chasing them.

The game is a unique Community Survival game. You can play on very easy mode or VERY HARD, and it can be really hard, even with mods. Some freaks are really challenging.

Even though there is no Steam Workshop (which is a bummer), there are plenty of mods on State of Decay 2 Modding Discord server or through Nexus Mods.

The multiplayer could be better. There is no server hosting, so you join the ongoing community of another player. You can help him to complete missions and by doing so you earn rewards that you receive them when you join back your ""world"".

Then you'll easily fit in here. The whole random open world setting which pushes your survivors to the limit with the unrelentless dead clawing at your gates with challenging gameplay is very well done. With 5 large maps to explore and conquer, you could easily spend days or weeks in each map building up your community and maxing out your bases before moving on to the next. I really like how you can save your survivors and communities to use them in future playthroughs.

With the latest Curveball update it throws even more random events at you to enjoy with new challenges. Solid melee and gunplay mechanics and mowing down hordes of freaks is always a good time. Alongside the chunky campaign mode (lots of unlocks, achievements, progression etc), you also have 2 other well made gamemodes called Heartland and Daybreak (earn prestige so you can unlock special things in the campaign mode) to spend countless hours on. Also has a great soundtrack and nice modding support!

I wish there were more games like this. Looking forward to State of Decay 3!

Sound effects and music are awesome, like the first one. The character's voice acting is nice.

Graphics are a great improvement over the first game. The characters, the zombies, the world, everything looks awesome. They added a lot of detail to the buildings, bases, etc. However, the UI was a bit of a letdown. Don't get me wrong, it looks great, but the note book-like UI of the first one was great for immersion.

Gameplay continues to be really fun and engaging as the first one. They improved a lot of the mechanics (like the outposts, survivor skills, bases, etc.), removed some that were annoying (like the influence, limited community inventory, etc.), but also some that were nice (like the special missions to cheer up/calm down the survivors, the world evolving when you weren't playing, etc.). Overall great improvement, a lot of new mechanics, weapons, skills, cars, etc. The new maps, the new bases, the new types of outposts, the plague hearths, the survivor quest lines and leadership, etc. a lot of new and great additions to the game. And the devs keep adding new features (like the curveballs), cosmetics and content with every update, for free!!😁

The main game is similar to the Breakdown (in the first game), sandbox mode where you start with a community and survive, without story but your own, and after that you continue to another map. The campaign is the Heartland mode, where you visit the map from the first game and face a new threat. And the ""siege mode"" from Lifeline (in the first game), now has its own mode, Daybreak, where you defend a position from many waves of zombies to earn points which you can use to buy equipment and recruit special survivors from this mode in the main game.

The main game is great, with all the different maps and bases, and all the new mechanics, it doesn't feel repetitive like the first one.
The heartland story is great, visiting the map of the first game, learning the fate of some of the old characters was a nice touch. 
The daybreak mode is very challenging and fun. However, once you completed it a bunch of times, it becomes really boring and repetitive. Grinding this mode, for unlocking all the achievements, the equipment and to get points to use it in the main game, gets really tedious.

There are some bugs, nothing game-breaking, some of them are hilarious to experience.

In short, awesome zombie game, I completed it several times, and still keep coming back to play and have fun with every update. 100% recommended.",1690223662,1700672398,True,6,0,0.577464818954467773,0,True,False,False

What can I truly say about the game in the current state that it's in? I got it on sale but the bugs can make for some frustrating experiences. Multiplayer is buggy and you have to jump through quite a lot of hoops in order to get it actually working.

The gameplay loop is pretty much what you expect from the game, kill plague hearts, gather resources, help survivors and repeat. Once you've done it all there really isn't much left.

Start the game up and found one community save, play as community. Lethal community:

> Local crack head chasing me (blood feral)
> After pulling off my years of souls experience of dodging, I beat the crack head to death
> Thicc boy notices me beating up his crazy cousin
> Thicc boy chasing after me while my souls experience has left me with an empty stamina bar
> insert ""why are we here.."" meme
> Joseph comes up short under a thicc boys fist
> Community is now very sad that Joseph couldn't make it
> Make new community because clearly I don't know what I'm doing
> 64 Hours later I've beaten the local crack heads, killed the meaty bois, tried to run over a thicc boy and blew up my passenger. Played with friends, accidentally set friends on fire with a moli and installed a working toilet.

Juggernaut Edition. was hoping the game just not improve only in graphic, but also fix most of it problem, but [b]NO,[/b] it was not [i] (new problem came along with the new edition). [/i] They enhance the game graphic just to make it more appealing to PC player (steam user). here are what I encounter/experience during my gameplay. 85% of my gameplay hours is in coop. 

[b] 1. constant disconnection from host (100% player who join the host game will experience this, even you have super duper fast internet - both you or the host) [/b]
[b] 2. invisible zombie (common problem). only the host can see it. but there was 1 time that it was the other way around. [/b]
[b] 3. Headless zombie still screaming and attacking player. zombie that have been decapitated or head blown off, still moving and attacking. same thing happen in daybreak gameplay [/b]
[b] 4. invisible wall around all building. 98% you can never shot a zombie through a fence with a big see through. a juggernaut will always hit an invisible wall when pounding/charging especially in base area.  [/b]
[b] 5. horde zombie spawning inside big rock and below the floor (depending on where map and base site you a playing) there is one time, in Meagher Valley map, there is a mission where an enclave needed help clearing an infestation. the screamer spawn inside a trailer house. the screamer is idling, stay inside because it cannot see or hear us, and we were not able to complete the quest. tried an artillery strike, but it still useless, an artillery strike, can't even penetrate a trailer house. [/b]
[b] 6. Game crash/freeze - usually happen when entering half of the game map, this will follow with an auto saving (icon on top left) game sometimes will freeze or crash (not a common problem). [/b]
[b] 7. Trader depot - from official SOD2 wiki [i]""The Trader you called for will always go to your Base regardless of your current location on the map.""[/i] . when calling a trader, the trader will always encounter zombie or horde zombie along the way, if the player don't go escort and save the the trader, 100% of the time the trader will die,  especially when playing in nightmare mode. the problem is, not because of the encounter, but after you save the trader and clear all surrounding area, the trader WILL NOT MOVE and go to your base, the trader will just stop moving and stand in the middle of the road.[/b]
[b] 8. player join. - when other player join your game, the other player will not spawn near you. totally different to player tether, where the player will tether near you, even the other player car will tether together. there was one instant where, my friend join, I was on the roof avoiding 2 horde zombie and 3 feral (nightmare zone), my friend spawn and go instant dead because he spawn near the ferals and the horde.[/b]
[b] 9. Talk about tethering - this just stupid. other player is force to follow you around like a chain dog.[/b]
[b] 10. zombie finisher - most of the time your finisher will be canceled, when a zombie fall or knock down, and half of the body/the zombie head fall and pass through a wall, cannot perform finisher, zombie finisher is totally useless when this happen, (common problem)[/b]
[b] 11. technically this game do not support wide screen resolution, no option on the graphic menu. you need to use windows mode, the game will auto follow your monitor resolution. no FOV slider either, you need to manual edit the game file to adjust the FOV. [/b]
[b] 12. military truck never failed to dubstep glitching[/b]

as much as I had fun playing coop in nightmare zone, the one thing that frustrate me the most is, every zombie in nightmare zone is basically a Screamer. an actual screamer (in nightmare zone) is a beacon to the entire map. I would not recommend this game to anyone, this game should be 60% cheaper than its current price, because one playthrough is enough (when using legacy perk, the loot RNG became terrible), starting a new game in different map, the playthrough are totally the same, only with different mission name, different NPC name with the same character face.

SoD2 is a sequel to SoD, you don´t have to play the first game, but with the release of DLCs dealing with the zone of the first game (Trumbull County) the experience gets even better if you are a franchise veteran. 

In SoD2, you can control any members of your community of a zombie apocalipse survivors, try to stay alive and, making the world ""livable"" again. This is represented by the four types of leadership and the Plague Hearts you destroy to make the area less lethal.The leaderships also imply goals, like Trader, Builder, Sherif and Warlord, and they all, in a more or less involved way, deal with other survivor communities that spawn out on the map.

You spend your time collecting resources, improving your base and doing missions/quests, both for your objective (leadership), community members and other communities. Those missions range from collecting items and destroying zombies, to check on state of other communities. THere is plenty to make you busy all the time on this game, even if is a great game to chill. 

Yeah, to chill. While sorrounded by flesh eating (your flesh, mostly) zombies. The pace of the game is great, the music is amazing, the controls are responsible and really fun (and funny) to drive cars. And the game can be frantic as well. The zombies are nothing to laugh at. The special zombies can be extra deadly, and the hostile human communities can be a pain to deal with (but at least on this case, you have to get close for them to start shooting). 

The game is fun and relaxing, and I can´t get enough of it. Can´t wait for SoD3, specially if they go with the same aproach: improving an already good idea, making it more organic, fun and also relaxing, while adding complexity and lore.

This is all the better, smoother graphics more responsive. The cars need repairs and fuel which really makes you think when you're pasting zombies.

The Curveballs are mostly penalties for playing the game, making it more grindy and less enjoyable. The few positive Curveballs you might randomly get are so marginal that they are just not worth it. More so, the update changed the spawning rate and frequency of zombies... they now spawn directly behind you, even if you cleared the room or area a few seconds before. This sometimes makes zombies undodgeable and unavoidable. Freak zombies also just randomly teleport behind your character.

So, if they fixed that, and added a couple of features of QOL in the game it would be perfect imo.

Pros:
Price.
Stable.
Can be challenging.
Extra in-game challenges.
Basic base building.
Plenty of weapons.

Plenty of replay value.
An homage to SOD1.
Basic coop.
Mods.

Meh:

Cons:
Probably the worst coded vehicles in any game ever.
Janky multi enemy combat.
Some longstanding bugs & some buggy missions.
Menu's & UI can be unfriendly.
Day/Night cycle is right but wrong.
An incessant barrage of inane missions from people who should not have survived this long.
More missions from the previous mission givers and their friends, relatives & ancestors.

The 'Help I'm Stuck' button has a cool-down timer.

EDIT 1: Curveball update ... like this game needed more missions, oh and they are buggy to the point of destroying saves, however you can turn them off.

EDIT 2: Turn Curveballs off button still broken and somehow you get Curveballs even if you turn it off ... genius. Game a lot buggier than before so minus a point as they seem to have lost themselves and the game that worked fine before this tosh.

EDIT 3: Curveball off button now works ... until you start another community and it borks itself again, getting crashes now when before I got none & some of the leader endgame quests are broken especially Warlord ... YAY ... FUN ... SMH.

A very easy game to get lost in especially if you can rise above the 'Rescue My Teddy' missions.

Firstly, I must say that there are a lot of negative aspects about this game, but there are also many positive aspects that make this game very unique.

The reason I give this a positive review is solely because I want Micro$oft to think that this game is a success, so they put more effort into State of Decay 3, which, for the love of god, I really need to have a better SoD2!

[h1]Regarding the positives..[/h1]
I really enjoy the perma-death feature of the game, losing a character is always an emotional event of frustration mixed with desparation. Because if you are like me, and play on nightmare or lethal difficutly only, then every charater is sorely needed.

I really enjoy the fact that you can build your characters up, by leveling them and by obtaining different types of skills, if the character doesn't already have a full skill-set, and then specialize each skill, to yet again, be presented 2 - 3 specializations to each base skill that will improve it further, which give bonuses to either the character itself, or abilities to build better infrastructure at your base, or to craft better items.

I really enjoy the looting aspect of the game as well. I'm about 300 hours in, and I still keep finding guns that I've never seen before. The variety of guns is a real treat in this game! On top of that, the game always makes you fight for more resources, you are almost always at the point of needing more of everything. A lot of survival games get very boring after the beginning, because once you have enough meds and ammo, the whole survival suspense just dies off, whereas in this game (at least on higher difficulty), you are always short on ammo. I love the situations where I tell myself ""fuck, I only have 15 rounds of ammo, or only 1 painkiller left, I need to make due with what I have"".

Building up your base and obtaining outposts is also fun. Playing on higher difficulties especially, there is always a certain balance of each mechanic of the game that has to be maintained (Food, Ammo, Meds, Materials, Fuel, Morale of your group, relations with other groups, gaining Influence (which is your currency), and much more), as well as many types of strategies that you can try to follow to find your own optimal way. And the better you understand how all these mechanics tie into each other, to more you will understand the game itself in order to succeed. Because all it takes, is to neglect one of these aspects, and your group can quickly be doomed and get to the point of no-return.

For example, you awaken too many plague hearts too early, the game sends out too many infesting hoards, which will then attack your base, in an almost tower defense/wave defense type style, without you having enough resources to fight it off, and thus risking it to spiral down into not being able to gather enough recources & maintaining the balance of the mechanics of the game I mentioned above, because you don't have enough resources to begin with.

On top of that, the devs have been supporting the game with free updates that contain more content for years, which is commendable.

All of this honestly makes for great replayability.

[h1]Regarding the negatives..[/h1]
Probably the worst coop you will ever experience in any game out there. Because the person who joins the host, isn't even part of the survivor group itself, no, they have their own ""hidden"" group of people that doesn't actually exist in the game and is basically safe from any effect of the world.

On top of that, you don't even share the same loot-locker, host and coop partner both have their own private locker, only accessible to them.

And neither do you share the same loot objects, which means, one person may not have anything to loot in a house, and has to stand around watching the other person loot, without being able to help. Which means you have a ""host"" and you have a person that acts as a ""pack-mule"", and nothing else.

And if all of that isn't already bad enough, the game also features theatering.. something you might would expect from an early 2000's game. This means that if you get too far away from the host, the game will teleport you to them.. Just unbelievable that they even considered implementing this.

It just ruins every kind of immersion you could possibly have, and simply kills the actual cooperative play.

Sadly, the issues don't end in coop, and there are plenty more in the core game itself.

Meele combat can get very clunky, with your character not reacting properly to your inputs of trying to dodge, or to change direction to swing at another zombie. Often times your character won't even attack the zombie your are facing, or even try to attack one that is behind other zombies that are in front of you, and that your character can't even reach.

Hit detection is an absolute nightmare, the amounts of times I have swung at a zombie without my attack connecting with them, despite my weapon visibly going through their body, is just unreal. It happens VERY frequently, especially when fighting in doorways or other corner- situations.

Something else that happens very frequently is that zombies will just straight up warp onto your back, dealing large amounts of damage. I have had zombies that were on my side or even facing me, who started doing their ""grab"" animation and suddenly warped on my back.

When driving cars, hoards of zombies will sometimes also spawn right in front of you, literally, just pop-in, with no time to evade them, destroying your car in a way that wasn't your fault whatsoever.

I've even had several occasions where zombies were inside of rocks, with no way to attack them, so they would just yell, and call in endless amounts of zombies from everywhere.

Ladders are broken. Your character will sometimes just walk straight off without even attempting to climb it, and simply injure or straight up die falling. And so many times I have simply been trying to get closer to the edge of a building to get a better shot at the 3 blood-ferals that were about to end my life, when my character just does their stupid animation to jump off the edge when I never even intended to jump off. Just remove the damn ""vaulting down"" animation from the game and let me freely walk on a roof or raised structure without the fear of the game screwing me over.

The way how zombie spawning works is also lame. They don't naturally re-populate an area that you just cleared by walking in from somewhere, they will straight up spawn back in, so they can absolutely spawn behind you in areas that should be inaccessible.

Being in a car is also quite annoying, it's like you're in this spawning orb that will just spawn zombies within a circle as you go. And you can never just stop to check your map.

Some quests are also bugged. I had a quest where I was supposed to drive a character back to my base, and he just wouldn't get in. He'd rather kill himself in the hoards of zombies that were swarming in, than to get into my car.

Also, don't ever enlist followers. The game won't let you know when they have blood plague, and they will just die without you knowing. Characters are also hell-bent on fighting anything while they follow you, so they will stay and fight and get swallowed by a hoard of 20 zombies rather than to run as you do.

Your NPC group is just braindead as well. I have been mauled to death by a feral right outside my base, while my group was letting me die. I had zombies inside my base that would chase me down and just run past my group members who were doing nothing. Even had to fight off a mission-type zombie attack on my base, while my group members where just inside the buildings doing nothing.

I really, really want to like it there is a lot about this game that is very fun, satisfying, and rewarding.  But at same time there are a lot of little things that just barely miss the mark and as a result I always find myself walking away from the game after a few sessions and not coming back to the same campaign.  I primarily play this game solo and I have a feeling a lot of the things that bug me work a lot better when you run this as a duo or a small group.

I think the biggest thing that irks me is the rate zombies spawn and respawn on the map.  They infest the map rapidly, and respawn way too quickly.  It's great to create a feeling the zombies are always advancing on you and closing in around you, but in terms of the core gameplay loop it makes the game unnecessarily grindy and somewhat limits the playstyles you can run with.  For instance I want to send out a character that's good in combat to sweep out an area, then send in a mule character to haul everything back.  Problem is unless you claim the area as a base or outpost everything repops almost instantly, not only when you try to return with the second character but also when returning with the first character, the roads are all clogged with zombies and plenty of enemies that will wreck your vehicle.  Getting around quickly becomes a real and constant hassle.  Yes, I know there is a difficulty slider that affects the rate zombies spawn but this is a problem on all but the lowest difficulty levels (even on normal they repop too fast).

Likewise missions pop up and expire way too fast given the chore travel in the game is.  And for some reason you lose rep and npcs get mad at you if you don't complete their request that you never agreed to do in the first place.

There's just a lot of little things like this that make the game... well I mean the game is meant to be grindy but these little things make the grind less pleasant than it should be.  Outpost and morale management, hauling things to and from outposts, maintaining vehicles, it's a lot of things that combined keep me from really enjoying the game.

Because honestly the rest of the game is fantastic, there are so many positives to various game mechanics but somehow it just doesn't keep me going for very long.  It just feels like the game's pacing is always a bit off, maybe it's really meant more for coop play than singleplayer.

Not going to tell anyone not to play this game because the hours I've spent have been enjoyable.  At the end of the day though this is a game I'm probably never going to get that deep into (to be clear it's not a difficulty issue it's primarily a pacing issue).",1626296209,1699745300,True,2,0,0.52147907018661499,0,True,False,False

I've put many hours of time into this game (Most from first playing on Xbox) and it keeps me coming back. I love almost every aspect of this game with only having three main gripes with the game. 

THE CONS -

The first being an almost total lack of a cohesive story line. There are many missions (lengthy and short) the game gives you, especially with with the leader missions you do later on in the game being most unique. But these just aren't nearly good enough to pass as good story telling. I will give props to the radio chatter you hear every once in while in game. That at least feels like Undead Labs are building some Lore to their games.

The second being the repetitive missions. It's easy after a while of playing to notice how every mission asks the same tasks of you. Deliver supplies to this enclave. Help find a missing person. Defend a person or an enclave. These missions often lack substance and can be sometimes be quick to complete. This problem stems from my previous complaint of this games lack of story and role thereof being filled with mostly forgettable side (sometimes fetch) missions.

And the third (It's kinda not really a complaint) being my over obsessive pondering on how this game could be improved or expanded upon (Which could also be defined as a positive and I will just touch on it later on as a positive).

Now onto the what I think this game does well.

THE PROS -

The Difficulty. Hear me out when I say this game is very unforgiving. Much like an actual apocalypse should be. 
Perma-death characters, out of control hordes of zombies, scary unique zombie types, blood plague infection, community & base upkeep, Timed missions, and deadly hostile enclaves all contribute to make this game as realistic (I guess with the exception of the unique zombie types) as possible. Plus a nice scaling range of five difficulties with a toggle-able slider allows you to experience your perfect zombie apocalypse.

The Zombies & Combat. While not being perfect, the combat is free flowing and feels great and rewarding. Undead Labs did a great job making zombie encounters realistic with their sight and sound mechanics. Fighting either melee or ranged keeps you on your toes and is probably the most important mechanic you want to master if you want to survive. Every encounter encourages you to play differently and be smart about it. Whether it be killing a hoard of zombies, taking down a juggernaut, or dealing with a hostile enclave; You'll find the combat never bores and always keeps the tension high.

The Cars. By far the most OP asset in the game, cars are the things that have saved my butt more times than I can count while playing. While essentially taking the role of this games quasi fast travel. It is an absolute blast just mowing down zombie hordes with your ungraded apocalypse vehicle. While being a little bit buggy at times, they definitely made driving fairly easy to navigate and appropriately integrated to playing the game.

The Community & Bases. Probably the most unique aspect of this game, managing your community and bases and improving them little by little adds some needed flavor of strategy to State of Decay 2 that just feels right in a zombie apocalypse situation. While being limited in its mechanics, it never the less plays an massive part in surviving, thriving and of course provides a much needed sense of home/relief when you're up against a wasteland of undead.

The Customization. State of Decay 2 allows for a myriad of customization options for your characters, your base, and even having plenty of weapons to play with. For characters it's their traits, skills, and clothing (yes, I know Traits and skill can and will be randomly generated). Although I do admit it would be pretty sick if they added a character creation menu where you could create your own perfect OP character (Name, Traits, Skills, etc.) as an separate experimental option before starting a game. (or even buying the option of it from any given game from your radio for an appropriately expensive influence cost to create). Tangent over. For bases, each map has many unique bases to play on and choose what to build to suit your strategy (I do wish every map had at least two 8+ survivor end game bases however). And having variety of cool unique weapons in a game should go without saying. Gotta show off your swagger. Am I right?

The Free Updates. I am completely baffled that Undead Labs has given State of Decay 2 many updates and still continues to this day. They could have released this game, done some bug patches, added some DLC's, and just reaped the profits from there on out without ever coming back to this game. It is truly a testament of how much Undead Labs cares for this new series they have created as well as the community that continues to support them.

Finally, The Potential. This is where I kind of had a gripe about but understand it takes time to expand everything fundamentally in this game. Undead Labs wants to do this game justice and In a way the State of Decay games are pioneering a new type of sub-genre of survival games that I hope only gets more and more intuitive in every way. I could type out almost endless ideas of how Undead Labs could improve upon the type of zombie apocalypse formula they have created but this review is already pretty long.
 
Before concluding, I wanted to give a quick shout out to the music in this game. It's truly amazing how awesome its sounds. It really fits the the rustic, dreary, and intrepid feeling It adds to the game. 

Overall, I highly enjoy playing State of Decay 2 and give it a strong 8/10. This game won't be for everybody and that's okay. Undead Labs have made something really special with their State of Decay Games and I'm optimistically excited for their third installment of this series.

Zombies constantly spawn, so even if you clear an area and kill all of the special ones, more will always just appear from thin air
We got rid of the diverse cast of interesting characters from the first game for a randomly generated list of people incredibly similar. If you could fully customise these people it wouldn't feel so bad, but eh..
Multiplayer is terrible. You are only a guest in someone else's game. You can't build for them, you can't share loot, and worst of all, each storage container in the game is separated and colour coded so only the correct player can loot them. You can't even explore the map individually (like one of you stays at home to defend and one goes out to loot) because you're rubber banded together.
Disappointing over all

2023 Update: After many years I decided to try this game again, and quite frankly it's not any better. You can now customise the clothing of your characters, but nothing else. You cannot design your own character, but you can randomly generate one over and over infinitely, which is basically the same thing but takes longer and is more frustrating.

The reason I quit however was the plague hearts. Dear lord the plague hearts.

I got into a new campaign to see 90% of the map covered in red plague heart goo. I had three radio calls back to back, but didn't pay attention to them as the three (I kid you not) plague hoards that descended on us infected two of my people. We were maybe 8 minutes in? None of us had guns yet.

So how do you cure this? Well you need plague goo dropped from plague zombies. 5 plague goo to be exact, which has a drop rate of about 1 from every 10 - 20 Zombies you kill. I had to kill about 75 zombies to get enough of the cure for my people. Tedious doesn't even begin to cover it

Of course, in that time I'm not helping the neighbours, so they're sending snarky messages about how selfish we are for not dropping everything to sort out whatever issue they're facing is. They left the map due to this apparently. And I've not been searching for food, medical supplies, building materials, fuel or ammo for my own community.

I finally managed to get everybody cured, I even found a vehicle (which was surprisingly difficult for some reason) and then set out to get supplies. The moment I F4ed was after I had literally just dropped off my first bag of medical supplies. I then immediately got a radio message saying we'd just been robbed of our medical supplies.

I was so infuriated by this I instinctively closed my eyes and had to take a breath. I opened them again to see my man getting attacked and infected by a plague zombie which seems to have spawned out of nowhere. Rather than kill another 50 zombies to cure him I decided I'd rather just not play anymore.

There are some very simple fixes that could make this game great. I really don't know who the target demographic is. It's a miserable experience, if they make a third game in the series I won't buy it",1611859818,1699379450,False,149,3,0.831915915012359619,3,True,False,False

I also liked the red talon units since that allowed one to get some really really overpowered characters going :) Heartland is pretty bugged. You might end up having to completely restart the progress as the main-quest wont continue.
edit: so i decided that the first review was a bit short and there are a couple of things I'd like to point out: 
- gameplay wise the sod2 is Much better. especially combat is absolutely amazing compared to the first one. dont know how to describe it better than to say that the combat is much more fluid. very enjoyable and what makes out some of the additcting part.
- story-wise it's much worse in my opinion. The main ""story"" doesnt even really have a story, it's pretty much a sandbox in which you get some things to do but basically it's move to a zone, destroy 18 plague hearts, move on. so that's a huge downgrade. It's not much better in heartland, you do get a story but it just feels worse than sod1. 
- The feeling of urgency is gone. I understand that a lot of people hated that in sod1 but I kinda liked it. In sod2 there is no urgency to do anything. Base defense is ultra easy. You rarely get attacked at all. I think in my 170+ hours and all the playthroughs it happened maybe twice, when i gave granade launcher to the people.

- Your companions should NEVER be allowed to initiate fight against anything; they are far too dumb for that. They should just fight what is attacking them and what you are already fighting. They are very good at awaking plague hearts, btw.
- In Heartland, when I finally recruited captain Logan, I was happy but this did not last. Indeed, as soon as he was recruited, Logan started running across the country to go to my base. I could not stop him. I eventually went to my base, expecting to find him there. Nobody. I eventually got this laconic message ""Captain Logan did not make it"". Very frustrating.
- I just abandoned a difficult game, where I was finally starting to control things, thinking that the worst was behind me. Then, playing my leader, I went to a friendly community to sell some stuff. Alas, I clicked on ""threaten"" instead of trade"". Here, there is no confirmation and no way to undo this misclick (in a menu), nor anything visual thing (like red color) to remind you that this option can be devastating.

I was honestly tempted to thumbs-down the game over this, mainly for political reasons just cuz MS-owned AAA studios shouldn't be shoveling broke garbage at us and leaving it broke for years on end -- even tho MS themselves have of course done this with their core products forever -- but.....

After actually writing out the criticism (rant :P), and thinking the whole thing through, I realized that because the ""best"" workaround for the bug basically involves just playing the game more, and getting more prime loot, which is all you are really trying to do anyway, it's relatively forgivable. Still annoying but ... anyway ...

Original review follows.

=--------------=

The most TWD-like of the zombie-survival games I've played. (Though I have not played DayZ.)

You have to maintain your colony in terms of several different kinds of key resources, which, at first will mean scavenging but eventually you can secure some outposts etc. to get daily income of certain resources. You come back from excursions sometimes with fun new toys or new friends, and sometimes with broken toys or dead friends. Until you are well-established, there is no ""take"" without a decent amount of ""give"" in terms of effort. You will be on the move constantly, switching between different characters on your team to have adventures, while the ones you just brought back, almost dead, recover.

The driving is very GTA: fairly cartoony and your passengers only have to start the ""i'm getting in the car"" anim and you are good to haul ass out of there. There's a pretty cool implementation for ORV/ATVs as well. If you try driving your basic hatchback on those ""you can't drive here""-style rocks -- you know the kind, that have zero physics ""give"" -- you will not have good results, but if you use a vehicle more appropriate for that terrain you can cross them better.

Combat is decently fleshed-out, melee, ranged, stealth, traps, throwables, etc. Enemies are the typical zombie-game mix of commons and specials.

Once you complete the relatively sandboxy campaign -- it's ultimately just about killing a number of well-defended targets, so, if you have the equipment and knowhow to do that quickly, you can -- you get to move your survs to Legacy Pool so you can use them to start a new game, or bring them into other games with their existing skills, cool equip, and a powerful new-game buff you get for winning. Note they exist as a real ""entity"", not just a copied save; i.e. if you move them out of the pool and they die, they're gone for good.

Heartland is an SP expansion and Daybreak is a MP, co-op siege mode where you hold off waves and get cool rewards and unlocks including for the main game.

Great fun overall but there are some gripes... Not showstoppers for me personally -- #1 almost was -- but ymmv.

1) you need xbox for windows login. this almost stopped me, because MS memberships are just this burdensome thing they keep changing ever 2 years and I never use. Finally they go ""ok we'll just have windows login to the Net and all your stuff is under that"", but I'm old school, and even though of course windows constantly ""calls home"" while your PC is on, I feel it's invasive to have to [i]personally[/i] log in to MS net every time I use my PC. Again YMMV. But I think the PC Game Pass thing kinda convinced me. Didn't know it existed. Why? Because MS messaging is terrible.

2) SoD1 people don't seem to like that certain missions can only be done by certain survs. It can be aggravating at times but it can also motivate the narrative ... when you send someone back out who has been beaten up and awake for 3 days already just because the mission just popped up and you are a greedy opportunist.

By the way chars do level relatively fast compared to other games. Like, you spend about an hour playing, doing a nice stealth scav run with one of your survs, they will come back with most basic skills maxed and advanced skills well-leveled. This is all good because ... well ... sometimes they die even faster. :P

3) Others have mentioned they don't like that when you play co-op campaign, you are basically playing on the other person's save. Your community doesn't benefit. I'm not even sure if you keep the items your holding. I would presume you do. TBH tho I'm not even sure if you play as ""yourself"" or one of their survs. In any case I have had plenty of fun in SP and it doesn't concern me.

4) Vehs get stuck a lot. The off-road thing I mentioned earlier is one aspect, but also, if you crash into certain things, you can get pinned and sometimes need another veh to get the first one unstuck. Again, it just motivates the narrative. :) It's frustrating at first but you will probably quickly figure out how to unstick them, out of necessity. :P

5) I'm finding Nightmare kinda overtuned and Lethal can only be worse. I'm new and of course there are still L2P issues but my tactics are decent and it's just not as fun. It would be different if your follower AI scaled up with the difficulty. It does not. They cannot keep themselves alive unless it's just against a few zeds. Roughly how one Redditor put it: ""count on them to do the most suicidal thing at any given moment, and you will be OK"". Frustrating because, on paper they have the skills and firepower. Just really bad AI coding afa how to engage zeds. If only the NPCs were 1/4 as good as the zeds are, at simply chasing down a target and killing it....

At a point in NM, the game throws 3x freaks at you. Three simultaneous ferals is basically a kill squad, and if you care to stay alive the gameplay loop now changes from fun and accomplishment to a lot of raiding and fleeing. Wipe a horde, do 15s of inventory management -- i.e. healing, rearming, picking all your goodies off the corpses of your former 'mates, fixing/refueling your busted vehs -- and voila another horde will be closing in on you when you look up. There is no sense of really making an incursion and securing an area, even after you have ostensibly done so by killing a bunch of hearts. :|

There's a delicate balance between difficulty/realism/tedium and I'm finding these choices not to my taste. By the way, at this point, the ""kill squads"" have eaten like 10 of my dudes, and the difficulty did [i]not[/i] ramp back down because I am now ""doing not so well"". :| 

End-game loop:

1. try to do stuff, but your most competent survivors keep dying cuz the game keeps putting them in OTT situations. (That's right: the game, not you, the player. LMAO.)

2. keep making the remaining [i]survivor[/i]-survivors clean the latrine at the base, to up morale, so they're not sad about the other ppl dying.

10/10 would have maxxed-out Red Talon operators clean latrines again. I mean, out in the field they just die anyway.

I did play on Dread difficulty. And I tend to be a little bitch about losing party members in games like this, where they just die forever. I like to save scum and just watch things grow. 

But every time I started a new game I would get about 5 hours in or so and I would have a survivor die. The circumstances in which they would die were very chaotic. Mostly it felt like I could have dealt with the situation better. But it was not fun and very quickly things get out of control.
After about the 5th new game, I just decided I need to roll with the punches better.  I finally continued after a survivor died and I realized Its not that bad losing a single survivor. But a few more days of playing I lose another two survivors in another extremely frustrating situation and I am done playing. 

It was the fucking exploding plague zombie curveballs that did me in. I HATED playing with that modifier. Some of the other ones I played against were annoying as well. But the explosions destroyed my vehicles, would ruin melee combat and quick takedowns, and drain me of my health resources. I would be ambused by ONE plague zombie and everything turned to shit and I somehow lose two survivors and my vehicle.
I did not take the time to see if I could turn them off because I was unable to keep up with the pace of the game. Between missions popping up and expiring, fighting off infestations, making your base feel useful, trading off survivors in the infirmary, constantly navigating inventories and menus, I never felt like I could get organized. Maybe thats just me.
Also, it feels almost impossible to stop anywhere while driving. Even to just look at the map. I know its a zombie game but it feels suffocating. Maybe I should re-think what I want to play, lol.
And FORGET about doing anything during night time. The night is pitch black and with your map being hindered by plague hearts, you can get lost in a second. Flashlights and headlights are also not great.
In combat situations when you are at a disadvantage and on the run, you can also get overwhelmed very quickly. I absolutely suck at this game. But one zombie can fuck your whole plan up. If you lost your vehicle and you need to run back home you had better hope you brought meds and snacks. You will never not run into a zombie which will always bring more. When you turn around to shoot a zombie, there will be another one attacking from the side or rear forcing you to keep running. Attacking and running drains stamina, and once its drained zombies are programmed to ruin you. 

There is a bug that I constantly ran into when searching and interacting at the base where my character would be stuck in a falling animation. It sometimes put my character into the dying animation. 
I accidentally clicked on the, ""threaten enclave"" button, because I am a dumb ass. But I was instantly swarmed by 3 or 4 people and murdered without a chance. I wish there was more of a buffer between that taking place so I could have felt prepared. Or a, ""Are you Sure?"" 
From the little I payed attention to about the curve balls, I like the idea. But I feel like It shouldn't be default mechanic, or at least not so early on. Or the option to turn it off, if its no there. But totally and completely FUCK the exploding plagues. 

I was not satisfied with how much progress It felt like I was able to make compared to how much I would lose due to my mistakes or unfair mechanics. The micromanagement felt shallow and inventory management can be a pain. Most of the times I would leave to scavenge or do a mission, I would make very slim progress before something went awry and I would have to return. The Immersion was not great and customization isnt really here. You can kinda immerse yourself if you really try. I really like the ability to enter almost any house. the variety of loot actually felt pretty decent at least early on. And I appreciate the different trade able goods. Even without any pictures. 
Melee Combat was good enough. It felt good, but neglected. And i bet with more love it could be the best thing about this game and that isnt a knock on any other part of this game. I just wanted more from it, and I was doing it more than anything else. 


This game is still really cool but I am just unable to enjoy it the way I want to, is all. I respect the developers for making this real and still working on it. These mechanics and ideas are pretty solid and I think with more time It would make for the ultimate game. I feel sad to uninstall this game and am mixed on whether or not I would recommend.
I will say this.. I think it would be much more fun playing with friends. And I would be more willing to play through these frustrations if I were. But unfortunately I have no friends to speak on this.
I basically want the State of Decay that my mind has created, Thanks to you guys.

⦁ This game is on sale often. If you get lucky you can buy it for $7
⦁ Great graphics
⦁ Good game play mechanics and resource management
⦁ Zomboid (zombie) variety 
⦁ Decent driving system

⦁ Special Zomboid's 


Cons
⦁ Sometimes the voices are so loud. The character voices become annoying after a while. It sounds artificial sometimes.  
⦁ The ai is a little jank sometimes. 
⦁ Very dark. Needed to raise gamma a little bit. 
⦁ Inventory management is fun, but once you have too many items it just sits there in your inventory. 
⦁The game sometimes feels like chore simulator after you finish your first play through. How many lands can you colonize from the Zomboids until the game becomes boring?

There is some fun to have with it for a while, however the game makes all it can to stop the fun all the time, making you go back and forth around the map wasting time most of the time. 

* Sometimes the game keeps throwing missions at you while in the middle of a mission and another one will come up, sometimes an urgent one, and then another...
* When in the middle of driving or fighting dialog/radio messages will come up and if you miss it there is no log to read it again.
* Finding survivors with the skills you need is a pain in the proverbial and gets tiring fast.
* Killing zombies in a game full of them is a waste of time once a character has had its progression completed, there is no point to killing zombies other than the freaks who give you a bit of influence. One would think that in a zombie game the devs would make killing zombies fun...
* Driving around can be fun at times, however cars break easily both by hitting zombies and the excessive amount of road obstacles which seem placed to stop you from having fun and to force you off-road, which can be fun except that the poor physics in the game can lead to the car breaking for hit-box nonsense reasons. To have more resistant cars you need a survivor with knowledge of Mechanics, and an auto shop workshop... things that after completing two maps I haven't been able to find/produce.
* The game gets very repetitive after a while and there is no real purpose after finishing a map other than being a completionist.

The worst: The game is too dark for long periods of time to the point where it is annoying, the night and day cycle is annoyingly uneven because the night lasts 3 times the day. Going out at night is just an annoying chore.",1698436840,1698436840,True,26,2,0.577193081378936768,2,True,False,False

There's a good amount of content (it'll probably take you around 30-40 hours to finish your first playthrough) and, for those who like to be challenged, there is good replay value via increasing the difficulty and starting again. It still has some bugs (mostly minor and I haven't personally encountered any game-breaking ones) but has fixed a lot of the issues that were present in the first State of Decay.

I'll be blunt. This is not some epic RPG that will enthrall you in its story. It's not purely about surviving hordes and you generally won't have enough resources to make it purely an action game. However, this is one of the most fun games in its genre and offers plenty of stuff to do so that you'll get your money's worth. Honestly, the only glaring flaw to this game is that the multiplayer sucks (there are plenty of threads discussing it so I won't elaborate here - but it's safe to say that State of Decay 2 is intended to be a single player game).

SoD2 is one of the best zombie survival games I've played and by the looks of things, the Juggernaut edition is even better.

The multiplayer experience is also better than some reviews, especially the very short ones, make it sound like. You can still develop character skills, get loot and deposit them to your own supply locker, use basic base facilities like crafting and repairs and trade with enclaves. Your entire community is essentially an off-screen guest in your host's campaign, but you need to return to your own campaign to fully manage recovery of survivors and you can only gain influence, not standing, for guesting. In short, you can do almost everything you'd do in your own campaign and all players get a bit more out of the world with easier takedowns and more loot per location. I can't really see it as anything other than win-win, but if you're expecting to form a joint community with another player, that's not really possible, although you could still share valuable resources like blood samples by hopping between campaigns.

The only actual obstacle we experienced in multiplayer so far was having to spend some time to investigate and disable VPN to make multiplayer sessions possible. No other errors here.

I only got it when I found out that the developers, despite working on a sequel, are still making updates and constantly adding to the game.  Just that convinced me to give it a try, and just 1 hour in I was hooked.  It's challenging, but no overly much, and it's the near perfect blend of GTA Zombies and Survival Adventuring that I was looking for.  

The survival aspect is not nearly as punishing as other survival games I've played, and I'd classify it as ""having survival elements"" to it rather than a full on survival game.  The base building is pretty simple, and the UI is very convenient and some would say rigid, but it's great if you don't want constructing a homestead to be the main time sink in your game.  

I love the foraging aspect, and while the combat takes a little getting used to, there's always something to do and always a need to venture out into the apocalypse to gather needed materials.  

I was warned that DIE is present in the game, and it is.  Most of the Str8 YT Mayals are zombified, apparently.  All that's left are Stronk Whamen o' Colour and their DIE Nu-Mayal Purse Puppies, and everyone is Alphabet.  Seems every 3rd storyline is either uniting or avenging an Alphabet couple.  But as far as affecting the actual gameplay, it doesn't very much.  Sure, given that the Type B's outnumber the Type A's almost 5 to 1, it'd be nice if there was some advantage or disadvantage to playing either, but that would be ACTUAL Diversity, and of course we can't have that.  

But in the day to day actual playing, IMO it's tolerable, and doesn't detract too much from the relaxing experience that is the rest of the game.  

I recommend picking this up on sale if you can, and I'm now looking forward to the sequel.  However, if you're one of those people who simply has had enough of the ESG virus infecting your escapism, well, I'm sorry to say that this game is just as infected as the world in the game.

Gameplay consists of busywork for OTHER survivor groups who apparently seem to fail miserably at the most basic tasks to keep themselves alive, and god forbid you don't play good samaritan, as they'll pack their shit up and leave, only to be replaced by another group who'll immediately start radio-spamming you for handouts as well.

The control-scheme for keyboard and mouse is jank at best, default binding your dodge (C) next to V, that'll open your map for some reason, preferably mid-combat.
Aiming is also fiddly with X (or was it Z???) being your Zoom for guns with scopes but the crosshair is so chunky and phat, that you'll be relying on ""Gunslinger"" letting you aim-lock with SPACE.

It's an absolute mess.

""Curveballs"" added in the newest update doesnt add much other than letterboxes constantly popping up on your screen while you're playing, informing you that some random person is stealing your stuff, or that some zombies now explode on death.

Why don't I recommend? Easy, woke garbage. 

Make the hillbillies gay in the first game? Hysterical
Make the hillbillies also have an obviously not mixed daughter? Now you're just making stuff up lol.

Mexicans everywhere!? Realistic. Especially when I use to live in places like these areas.
African Americans everywhere? In this part of the country? Not so realistic. You'd be hard pressed to find more than 1-5 families in these areas IRL.

""Blah, blah, blah socialism is good"" from random companions? Disgusting
BLM crap? No thanks. I don't support terrorist thieves. 
""Punched Nazis"" trait? rofl
Of all the hundreds of traits they put into the game, not one single trait that has anything to do with faith or spirituality. No Bibles to find. No perks or facilitates related to worship or prayer. 

And a lot more than I care to mention of other nonsense and woke PC garbage. But seriously, if you're going for equality, how is this so obviously skewed towards leftist ideology? You'll fill the game with political current day nonsense but you won't add in things that damage your fragile world perspectives? 

Aside from that there are a lot more they could have and should have been done with this game. But here are some more issues...

Brought back Trumbull Valley in a whole new version of the game? Heartland was great! Then you guys retcon Heartland events by blowing everyone up off screen? You guys should work for Disney! The end of Heartland and the events after it was made to feel so pointless, even before you retconed the whole thing. 

Started the game out in the tutorial of being able to have relationships with your fellow survivors but it's nothing more than RP in your head after the tutorial. Went with the boyfriend and girlfriend starters and it never goes further than that. Aside from a few remarks around base like ""hey sexy!"" that's it. Missed opportunity to setup RP related events and traits. 

Daybreak. Oh, Daybreak. Dubbed one of the worst DLC's of all time by many for good reason. 1 map you'll have to play a lot more than you would like to, to unlock things you're not quite sure are worth the trouble. Between people sabotaging your match, dropping out, being generally incompetent, possibly mentally challenged, and the overwhelming amount of zombs the game throws at you... you'll be grinding those points a long time. 

Game itself is great. They have come out with a lot of free updates and that's one of the best things. But they want to keep pushing ""the message"" in with the game and it makes the game lesser for it. The 90%-95% of us that play the game and don't have anything to do with that stuff, don't want it in our game. Thankfully mods exists to remedy this problem. Just hope this doesn't continue on to the next chapter of this franchise.

In that time they've finally sorted out a great many problems, improved the core gameplay loop, and produced an enjoyable game.

The game has a very strong gameplay loop: Start by managing a small cadre of survivors in finding shelter, collecting small amounts of supplies, and building better facilities. Recruit additional survivors, move to a new location, expand your loop with better resources.

To deal with the fatigue of ""Everywhere you go is just killing zombies,"" SoD2 introduces the notion of Plague Hearts—epicenters of zombie activity that make zombies infectious and cause them to congregate in hordes. You must go into infected buildings to defeat Plague Hearts, and without destroying them, parts of the map remain unsafe, so you are forced to leave your base and collect the weapons necessary for these dangerous encounters. Fighting a plague heart also agitates zombies in the area, so you must be ready to finish the job. This prevents the ""bunker"" mentality of just hunkering down in your safe base, and makes you go interact with the rest of the world.

The use of leader roles gives you avenues for pursuing specific kinds of play, depending on whether you want to prosper through trade, reconstruction, collaboration, or domination. Finishing a game and making a successful survival community lets you start with benefits in your next game, so you're encouraged to keep playing new games. Since you can now keep a stable of survivors and call them to join your community, you now have ways to get your best survivors back into play and fill specific gaps in your skill set, though you can always recruit outsiders too.

There are still a few lingering bugs. Infected characters sometimes suddenly die long before their infection timer elapses. Geometry holes provide places where vehicles become stuck and then, due to a physics error, become destroyed, forcing you out on foot or possibly even injuring or killing your characters. Even so, multiplayer is stable, whether you're doing wave defense against zombies or dropping in on a friend's encampment to lend a hand (or steal their stuff).

Built on the UE4 engine, SoD2 has decent graphics, and the voice work is fun and sometimes charming. Replayability is high, especially as you pursue special weapons and items through the game's special Bounty Broker system, which challenges you to complete certain tasks for rewards.

Of specific note, level design on the maps for this game is extremely good. The levels generate a sense of flow, giving you a clear idea of the directions that you want to explore and go, but also reward going off the beaten path. Environmental messaging creates choke points or trains you to use roads and to go around obstacles in an intuitive way that never requires pop-ups or intrusive UI; it's all tutorialized through the gameplay. The game rewards taking prominent landmarks and discovering important sites, but also challenges you to carefully choose where to set down roots as you'll slowly exhaust resources in your area. This creates a constant pressure for you to be on the move and to upgrade to new places, which keeps you active instead of waiting for the next day to start at your home base.

Overall, the game experience has become a net positive, and I enjoy this game even years after its initial release.",1655483124,1697682970,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Economy has bottlenecks with ammo, as it should. But not too much so yet is fun to gunplay.
Zombie variety makes a lot of gameplay bcs they should be dealt with in different ways each of them. Bloaters are a joke...until you crash the car on them or they are behind you. Which is great.
There is a ton of strategycal aspects in this game which makes it very nice. Scouting and stealth are actual assets.
Random events spice up the adventure, specially the ""black heart curveball"".

One thing that irks me is the mobilie-like wait times where you have to wait said time while an item is crafted or a building contructed.

The game story-wise is very lacking and drops off almost instantly. This game is mostly to be taken as a survival sandbox rather than an adventure story.

I like the graphics, the survival aspect (which has a ton of depth to it, especially the base and community building).  The action is pretty good too.  The variety of undead is pretty good and challenging.  It's fun to just roam around and explore.  The game can be a hair buggy...but in it's current state...I think it's pretty rare.  Overall a very enjoyable game.

That being said, I'd definitely like to see some changes on State of Decay 3 though.  Number one is no more curveballs that DON'T GO AWAY.  The Black Heart curveball sucks.  For a casual gamer, it's overly difficult, even on the lowest settings.  I'm kinda torn on the perma death things.  It ads a ton of tension to the game....but if you make just one stupid mistake, it could cost you a character that you really love.  The next thing I'd change is making it easier to upgrade your base.  After 35 hours of playing, I still have yet to get a survivor that can do construction.  Construction is super important to base building.  I would also love to see actual scopes on the weapons that work.  Some weapons come with scopes, but you can't actually see the scope view.  Very annoying.

This being the only XBoxLive game I own, I obviously forgot my login password, and I don't use a cell phone, cause I don't need it 99.9999% of the time.

When I first played SoD2 a little over a year ago, I was [b]not[/b] impressed. The game was buggy and unstable, I was plagued with XBox login errors, and the overall game just wasn't that great. Essentially, it was a step down from SoD1 but with better graphics.

Fast forward to 2023, and I decided to dust it off and try it again (I'm a sucker for Zombie killing). I'm glad I decided to give it another try, because it feels so much better. The game didn't crash on loading, my screen wasn't spammed with XBox login errors, and it feels like it is running much smoother. While the game itself does get repetitive, there is now enough content to keep me busy while usually having fun. The ""Curveball"" update was a nice touch and the expanded areas are fun to experience.

It's taken 34 Patches, but I'd say it's a 7 or 8 out of 10 and I'm glad to change my review to ""recommend.""",1653355020,1696904416,True,0,0,0.572171866893768311,1,True,True,False

The experience is enjoyable, and with the feature updates they've done since release, there's really quite a bit to do and it's quite enjoyable. I have hundreds of hours into this game, and will likely put in hundreds more.

So why the Do Not Recommend? Simple. My 12 hour Dread community that will no longer load. This is a known issue that has been happening since release, you can find various forum posts about it since the game was brand new. I've tried all the troubleshooting, using the community as a client in a multiplayer game, verifying Steam files, even downloading the Community Editor and removing each of my survivors in turn. It still won't load. This is an AAA game by an AAA developer which is still listed for an AAA price, and a lost save game represents potentially hundreds of hours of work lost, so this is completely unacceptable and utterly poisons my ability to recommend the game. Yes, you'll have a good time, but that can be taken away at any time, leaving you with nothing. The developers are aware but haven't fixed it because they don't respect the consumer or their time and I cannot in good faith recommend giving them money.

I know I'm screaming against the void, I know that the game has incredibly positive reviews, but if even one person sees this and doesn't buy it will have been worth it.

The first few hours were entertaining gathering the materials, but after a while the game mechanic felt bland. In short, some may find this game very fun while some may get bored after a few hours.

The [b]gameplay and controls[/b] are similar to the first. The movement of the characters seem a little more fluid than the first, but there isn't much added in regards to content after that. The premise allows the player to choose between two partners. They start in a mini-intro mission that introduces the player slowly to the game. Eventually, the player establishes a base and the fun increases. The menus, options, and potential to build a community can be a little overwhelming at first, but over the time the player familiarises themselves with the necessities to keep things going. There are a decent amount of variation to the missions which include contacting new neighbours, helping them, doing bounties, taking out zombie hot spots (sort of to clear areas to claim them), and random missions that will come and go. Again, all are fun for a short time, then everything sort of feels repetitive after the fact. The fighting and shooting portion is fun, and the player can do some ""finisher"" sort of actions. This area does feel limited as only one zombie at a time can be attacked.

Players are allowed to grow their communities by adding almost any NPC into their fold. Some NPCs will come with a set of skills. In order to acquire new skills the player has to set out in the world to explore and find books in order to gain new skills or knowledge. This part is cool which allows for greater base upgrade. It comes to a point though where a decent amount of variation is needed for the player to achieve any sort of progress or upgrades within the base. The open world exploration is fun and feels like there is always something to check out. The difficulty (even on easy) can get tricky and will provide players with a challenge. The multiplayer is certainly a cool feature, but feels quite limited. Depending on who is hosting will determine who gets progress for their community. Some players on the reviews didn't seem to like this.

The [b]visuals and graphics[/b] are a slight upgrade from the previous game. Everything that needs to be there is there, but not much more has been added. The variation in the enemies is certainly cool and their FXs are quite decent (especially the juggernaut). I felt like this area of the game is mediocre at best. The [b]sounds and music[/b] are also okay. Again, not much to go on about here either than everything that is required to be included is there.

Overall, not a bad game, not a great game. In my personal opinion I don't feel like I could recommend this game. I got bored of it pretty quickly, even with the multiplayer feature and ability to travel to different maps. The driving mechanism hasn't improved at all since the first - which is sort of key to getting around the map. Don't think you'll be climbing any hills. The game seems limited in its attempt to keep players engaged, and once the fun of exploring, gathering, and base building is done - doesn't seem like there is much purpose to keep playing. If this appeals to you, especially on sale, I'd say go for it. Otherwise, I'd say save your money.

I bought it during a sale and I sugest you to do the same if and only if you have played the first game and want to check this one out.

Depite the hicups, thie game is a welcome evolution of the first game. The developers have dropped the boring side missions you had to complete in order to gain bonus with your community and they have improved how the ""currency"" of the game works - it makes more sense now. 

The only real problem is the lack of story. In comparisson with its predecessor it's safe to say it's practicallly non existent in this continuation.

There  really needs to be a fast travel as it is very repetitive having to go from one side of the map to the other every time when doing leader quests and having to switch players to do it. You should be able to do all quests on one character if you do not allow for fast travel!!!! Honestly I just prefer creating one player and using it instead of having to switch over and that is just me and there is a reason why 99% of games are like that and do not allow more than one character and switching between them to do quests, yes allow camp members and to switch but please allow all quests to be done on one character.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

The game is definitely built to be primarily a single-player focused game with the ability to have multiplayer assistance. 

Basically if you plan to play with a friend, it works like this; You have your own world with your own populated community of survivors. If you wish to join a friend you join their world with their community as one of your survivors from your community. Meaning you bring everything with you on that survivor you choose to play as in their world. You are then tethered to the host player Via a large AoE vicinity. The purpose of multiplayer seems to be there to help the hosts community, not to be there to build one with them. Once your character is hurt or needs rest you have to go back to your world and switch character to then rejoin them. 

It's not all bad as you still have full access to the game with your host, it's just an unnecessary hindrance to the player having to play that way, the games multiplayer would be much better if you could build a community with your friend, starting the world together, but it's still worth giving it a shot as long as you are aware of these things. It's still a very fun game to chill and play with a friend.

Now firstly I want to say that despite this games many flaws, I do still find it enjoyable and if you like the idea of a zombie open world sandbox then this game is probably worth picking up when its on sale.

Now as to why this review is negative.

BUGS! So many bugs, game froze me out of controls when I tried to access vehicle storage, I have encountered countless minor bugs from the controls locking up in certain situations to my set way-point deciding to move itself, certain weapons seem to bug out when equipped with mods, there are countless others.
I spent a little time looking around the forums and it seems that a lot of these bugs have been there for a long time, and the developer just doesn't bother to address them, instead opting to focus on minor content updates.

Requires you to login through an Xbox live account in order to play in single player. 

Is slightly WOKE. Is a small and subtle thing but in a country where something like 60% of the population is white people the majority of survivors seem to be Black, Asian or Hispanic. Makes me wonder if the zombies in this game prefer to eat white people, does that make them racist zombies for excluding minorities from their dinner menu? Or were they eating the ""junk food"" first and saving the good stuff for last?
Aside from that, out of all the tutorial characters, there is only one white male, who just so happens to be written in as the good for nothing friend that always needs bailing out and will probably be the guy to get you all killed. He is also the only character written in a negative way, Kinda feels a little discriminating against the white men with that one. Thankfully other than that i have not noticed anything else.

Lastly, there are a lot of things in this game that will make you question the general competence of your community of survivors as well as the development team, The majority of unique outposts (landmarks) are totally garbage and offer only negligible benefits, one of them (provides power) is actually rendered obsolete by the builder legacy boon (free power and water) which makes every other legacy boon kinda look like garbage by comparison, for some reason adding one additional bed to your bedrooms causes your bedroom to have a daily materials upkeep cost, some of the bases that have built in defence towers have them set up facing the least useful direction, most bases have buildings that the survivors simply can't utilise in any way such as the farm on one of the maps which has a building half full of junk and a few beds set up, beds which your survivors simply can't use for whatever reason, and instead of clearing out this building to make more sleeping space (or anything really) you have to cram more beds into the other identical building that is being used as a sleep-space which makes everyone unhappy because of the cramped sleeping conditions.
Most, if not all bases also have a whole bunch of unused outdoor space that is either empty or home to useless garbage that takes up valuable space that your survivors can't clear or make use of because reasons?. Cannot prepare feasts or make coffee without having a survivor that has a perquisite skill.
Yeah, there are a lot of things that will make you scratch your head in bewilderment while playing this game.

- Strong sense of DÉJÀ VU 
Almost nothing had changed from the way it played, looked and sounded in the first game. Same fighting mechanic, same shooting mechanic, same looting mechanic etc. Better looking graphics though. The curve ball event has something too nasty to be liked.

-the lonely driver
Driving in this game is still as lonely as the first game. Even Old games such as GTA v can at least create the illusion of other living people but not this game, even after so many years from the first game you the player are still the only entity that will go and drive around the map or repair the cars etc even when there are many cars in this game. Nobody walk around the map for any reason whatsoever. They will not come to find you for anything. Everything related to NPC interaction is exactly the same as the first game.

-reskin enemies with no new enemy at all
The one new enemy in this whole sequel, after so many years, believe it or not, is a lump of meat that cannot move called the Plague Heart. Man this sequel is so lazily made I cannot believe the audacity of the company.

-a bit of woke culture
Man, I simply cannot create a random blonde character regardless of gender in this game for the life of me. I tried re-rolling the random recruit for 20mins, nobody has blonde hair . The devs made sure of it imo.

I just now put the game down for good (I think), because I did a mission not knowing what to expect and my newest follower, whom I recruited in the last mission, was killed by a plague juggernaut. I know plague versions are more powerful than their normal iterations, but with 2 followers in tow, I must have gone through 60 rounds of shotgun shells and .357 magnum all in the dome, and he still didn't go down. He grabbed one of my followers and since I was exhausted, I couldn't save her. The follower that I JUST recruited. And since the game does the Dark Souls thing, you can't savescum.

Now I get the design philosophy of constant saving, but when some really unfortunate shit like this happens, maybe I want to savescum. But I can't, so I just lost a follower who really rejuvenated my interest in continuing the run. And so I think I'm just kinda done. That's unfortunate, but I guess I can always do another run in a different location. It is a fun gameplay loop. And I should mention that without plague versions of special zombies, you're very unlikely to ever lose a follower, especially to the blood plague.

That actually brings me to the next point: destroying plague hearts is actually quite easy. It's fun, too - which is good, but the challenge really isn't there unless you royally screw up. I lost a follower because when I was attacking a plague heart, I stopped to attack the zombies that began to swarm us. This is a critical mistake. All you have to do is bring 2-3 explosives to the plague heart and throw them in sequence, and that brings it down 80% or so. A few more rounds from a shotgun or whatever, and it's destroyed. But the important thing is, it destroys all zombies in the immediate area.

You might think this creates some tense situations where the swarming zombies are a major obstacle in your way, making it difficult to destroy the plague heart. But no, not really. It takes less than 10 seconds to destroy a plague heart with explosive. And you can do it this way every time. There's not, like, different versions of plague hearts or anything.

So the game is in the weird space where it's sort of hardcore, in the sense that you can lose followers permanently, but the overwhelming majority of the time it's a distant threat. Which is fine, really. Like I said, I would prefer if they gave you the option to savescum. Like maybe you can savescum but you have to make some kind of sacrifice of resources or something like that. I don't know, but losing my follower immediately after recruiting them because of a canon event where I had to battle a plague juggernaut was extremely frustrating.

But frustrations aside, the game is a good timekiller. You'll typically be doing the same kind of missions over and over and unless you increase the difficulty on the slider, you won't have too difficult of a time amassing resources and whatnot. Vehicles are also pretty easy to continually maintain once you get your base running.

Another potential flaw: I personally don't see the difference in effectiveness between melee weapons. It's easy enough to get your melee combat skill up, and the superheavy weapons don't seem much more effective than the normal or even light ones.

The variety of guns and detail put into their descriptions is really good.

Overall, this is a good game. I would say it's worth 10 bucks or less. If it's more than that, just wait for the sequel.",1696212557,1696212557,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I say low stress mainly for the lack of hunger and dehydration elements. I don't even think I saw a different weather pattern other than sunshine and darkness. (Go play DayZ if you want to die from the cold weather in the first ten minutes. I play that too) This game allows players to focus on community crafting, leader building, and zombie smashing. And it's fun. If you crank up the difficulty though this game gets tough!

[b] GRAPHICALLY [/b] the visuals are top-notch. The distant scenery is well put together. The lighting effects as the sun rises and sets will sometimes give me pause. I don't have a high end tower anymore (i5-6600, NVIDIA 1660 Ti) but I can run all the graphics on ultra with no performance issues.

Actual [b] GAMEPLAY [/b] is seamless. You'll be driving through the entire map using various vehicles left on the road usually in need of fuel or repair. Not one loading screen or any wait times no matter how fast you go. A zed horde in your way is no match for an up-armored vehicle barreling down the road. A satisfying squish awaits the zombie in your way. Be careful as each zombie that paints your car red will damage it slightly. 

[b] CHARACTER [/b] development is worth the effort. Each settler has four core stats that upgrade with the respected performance. Don't want to FIGHT, then your fighting skill stays low. CARDIO is the easiest to build as you'll want to run everywhere anyway. With each settler you recruit, there are hidden traits that you discover. Some good, some disruptive. Populating the community you like is [i] VERY [/i] possible. Don't like how this guy turns out? Exile him! Finally guided that leader to greatness? Take them to the next map to start a new community with the benefits they offer.

[b] MISSIONS [/b] will pop up as you play. Some are rescuing a trapped survivor that may join your community. Some are related to your community leader's leadership focus. Do, or do not the missions. They will expire if neglected. The missions won't just pile up like a long to do list. There is a core mission and that's [spoiler] to rid the map of the plague cores that cause the zombies to remain. [/spoiler] 

[b] COMBAT [/b] will vary based on your playstyle. Wild gunplay will suffer due to a lack of ammo or the durability of firearms. Ammo is craftable and with the right settler in your community you can make what you need. Weapons are repairable at a cost. Melee weapons suffer the same durability issues but are much more quiet with their use. Stealth is effective at any stage of the game and the stealth kill weapons do not degrade. Animations are fun to watch but a lengthy tackle and smash can be interrupted by a nearby attacker. So many ways to kill zombies with so many weapons to choose from make it well worth the scavenger hunting.

[i] At the time of this review I only have been playing one map. I started over a few times once I got a hang of how the game plays. [/i]",1624534548,1696131129,True,3,0,0.532037436962127686,0,True,False,False

Ol' Gramps has got a tale to spin for ya.

I remember the time when games were just a few pixels on the screen, but let me tell ya 'bout this ""State of Decay 2"" thingamajig.

Back in my day, we didn't have none of them fancy-schmancy graphics, but lemme tell ya, this game sure looks purdy.

The world's gone to the dogs, with them zombies runnin' around.
Now, I've seen my fair share of critters in my time, but these brain-eaters are somethin' else!

Here's a funny story: One day, I sent young Billy out to scavenge some supplies.
The boy's quicker than a rabbit in heat, but he ain't the sharpest tool in the shed, if ya catch my drift.

He comes back, all excited-like, saying he found some ""gourmet food"".
Imagine my surprise when he pulls out a can of cat food!
Called it ""zombie apocalypse delicacy""!

I told him, ""Billy, that ain't for humans!""

But ya know what? With a sprinkle of salt, it ain't half bad!

Anyhow, back to this game.

If ya like bossin' folks around, buildin' bases and fendin' off them zombies, this here is the game for you.

But lemme warn ya – don’t get too attached to your survivors.
It's heartbreakin' when one of 'em becomes zombie chow.

And for Pete's sake, don't send 'em out to get food alone.
You might just end up with a pantry full of cat chow!

In conclusion, ""State of Decay 2"" gets two thumbs up out of three from ol' Gramps here.

Woulda been three, but I lost a thumb in a, uh, ""scavenging accident"".

bugs that have been in the game since launch have not been adressed at all and instead they add even more bugs  with each new update, which most of them will get fixed at some point but not the ones that ruin this game.

bugs that have never been fixed in the game for years:

-molotov or any fire explosives will explode in mid air and burn you instead of the zombies. this happen because is like you are hitting a invisible wall.  

-barely touching objects with your car will make  your car get stuck and explode.  this ruin your experience in the hardest difficulty 

-if you run while looting in buildings your character will get stuck in a jumping animation. this again ruin your experience when you are in the middle of running from a horde and get you killed in the hardest difficulty.

-checking your inventory will sometimes make your character spin in circles. you can quickly fix this by jumping, however in the middle of fighting a horde and you are trying to switch between weapons can get you killed because of this bug in lethal mode.

-the latest update (curveball update ) broke the  story missions in trumbull valley.   you load the game and the missions will not happen or they are broken, with the npc spawning in their base or in your base instead of the place that the mission take place. which will count as a instant mission failed because the game think you are running away from the mission area.

-not being able to call traders  or assist from your enclaves.  all this can be fixed with closing the game and reload your save though.

-game constantly crashing. this one i dont know what is the trigger, it can be anything between driving around,  fighting too many zombies or just destroying a plague heart make the game crash.

in the current state of the game i cant recommend this game, is a huge mess  and again, i love that the game is still getting  support, but come on guys... fix the bugs please.",1610160266,1696097479,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

you dont fit through gaps you obviously should be able to.
stealth is (really not) an option.
very many forced interactions (that you will fail if you ignore) so you cant really play the way you want. 
dont try and use controller.
the curveball events turn themselves back on.
you get locked into animations, which is awesome in a zombie game.
you'll spend hours leveling up a character just for the TERRIBLE AI follower system to get them killed. (this happening over and over made the game unplayable)

I love how you can customize the difficulty of your community, of the map, and of the zombies all separately. You can't carry much stuff at once and ammo is pretty scarce. Like, you can find plenty of ammo but if you wanna use guns, you run through it fairly quickly. My only issue is the carrying capacity is pretty small, but its understandable as its trying to be somewhat realistic which is totally reasonable. You can't sleep through the night though, that kinda sucks. You can't sleep away any time at all actually. For some reason the night time feels way longer than daytime. All the random missions feel kind of the same though. Honestly I'd rate this game a solid 8/10. The only issues I have with it are mainly due to my own play style and preferences, nothing to do with bugs or crappy game mechanics. You can't heal or cure infection while in a vehicle which is kinda dumb, your carrying capacity is very limited, like items that stack in your storage do not stack in your backpack. Ammo of course stacks on you but most items do not. And the few items that do stack in your backpack have a very small stack size. Like for ammo, a stack is 40 rounds, and it can be increased to a max of 60 I believe with character skill upgrades. That's not much considering you only have a max of 12 inventory slots on your character, and not all have 12 slots, it depends which backpack you have and your characters skills. the backpacks range from 6-8 inventory slots, and pockets range from 2-4 slots. But you can always have a primary weapon, secondary, a melee and a close combat melee which I believe you cannot un-equip the close combat melee weapon but you can swap it out for other ones. You don't need to eat or drink for your own character, you have no hydration or hunger stats, just health, stamina and infection. The only use for food and water is to keep the morale up in the community which is essential. On a harder difficulty for the zombies, the hordes are everywhere bruh, you can't escape them, its wild. They're also increased in health, damage, size and more freaks or mutated ones. I don't know what the hard difficulty for the community is like as I haven't done that. And harder difficulty for the world just means more plague hearts which are the sources of the zombies that can infect you, you gotta take those out to secure outposts if they're in range of the plague heart. Overall its a pretty solid game, definitely not an easy one. I would highly recommend this.",1696018515,1696018515,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's embarrassing to admit but after all the hours put in, I am still bad enough at it that I have to watch others play to get any idea of how to survive. The work the developers put into the game is obvious and they have continued to add new features the community wanted even years after development. There is always something to do when you are trying to survive the apocalypse so even with a lack of a strong story line after the intro I am constantly finding ways to entertain (read: stress) myself. 

SOD 3 is likely a couple years away still but with all the love that's been put into the game post production I am still highly entertained.

I enjoy taking high level characters out to murder hordes, loot everything, get idiot factions killed and running everything over in the cars; also playing Daybreak.

Inventory management can be rough but it's not too difficult to just hot-swap a crap outpost and dump off your small stuff there, if you don't already have an outpost per active section. It also helps keep you stocked up and healthy which you'll need on harder difficulties. Eventually you'll have to go back to base for missions, dropping off rucksacks and switching to another horde murderer. I dunno I like the idea of returning to base instead of just swapping a character wherever, I live and die by my cars and wont see them abandoned in the field.

Daybreak can be kind of good for aim training, just jump over the wall and do constant 180's shotgunning everything that moves and stabbing anything dumb enough to come close.",1695877222,1695877222,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My feelings on this game are NEUTRAL. Decent amount of fun, but a lot to be frustrated about.

[h2]Pros[/h2]
- Diversity in weapon types
- Flexibility in play style
- It's fun to mow through hordes of zombies
- Base building is pretty fun

[h2]Cons[/h2]
- Clunky controls. You really have to get used to the dodge mechanic at first (not hard. just not super responsive, but iframe window is pretty large)
- Melee can be frustrating at times
- Certain ""better"" cars have awful controls
- Coop is badly set up. You are a ""helper"" and not actually playing the game together. You are stuck to the main player.
- You will constantly get ""stuck"" (thank god for the unstuck command on the radio)
- Lots of bugs that can be frustrating in combat situations
- Many achievement bugs (achievements that have clearly been done do not get counted)",1695849325,1695862632,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1]This game has a really bad problem with zombies spawning behind you[/h1]

Zombies will constantly spawn behind you, around corners, and anywhere out of sight in your immediate vicinity, anytime you or an object or zombie around you makes ""noise"". No difficulty setting stops this from happening. The only thing that the difficulty settings change is the frequency and number of zombies that the game will spawn behind you.

This artificial difficulty means that you need to constantly spin your head around in order to not be caught unawares by a zombie spawning behind you. You can't tactically go room to room to clear out buildings or open areas because the moment you generate any noise the game will spawn zombies behind you.

Even on medium to high difficulty, you can very easily get into an endless loop of zombie spawning behind you, you turn around to deal with the zombie, but the noise of you dealing with the zombie causes more zombies to spawn behind you again.

And if you're thinking about getting to a car to escape the endless ""zombie spawns behind you"" loop, SURPRISE! A bloater spawned on the road in the path of the car while you were going through the animation to get into the car.

Checking the road before getting into the car is useless. Tactically clearing out a building is useless.

Start new game on standard to get my bearing, get hit by 2 of the new cUrvEbALL events in 2 days stright. Tooltip talks about them being positive or negative but one is a thief stealing ALL resources from my meager initial outposts and somehow chilling on the other side of the map, right next to a plague heart (he easily travels ~3km to steal MY resources tho). Manage to get there to stop it, thought it would be an initial event resolved via diplo, the guy starts shooting as soon as I approach, since I'm literally next to a plague heart I cannot fight zombies or it will awake. I cannot use firearms. The thief does tho. A screamer casually appears. Mfw this moth4fucka just awoke the heart. 

Restart with a new community because well, it's literally my first day.

Day 3 (removed gurveballs but SURPRISE, somehow they get enabled again if I reload my game) I reload my game and 17 sec later ""Curveball, fuel drain, must kill the plague heart else the ENTIRE MID PORTION of your map will drain a car completely empty in 4-5 secs"" 

wot? 

I must get there on foot, crossing the whole country... I'm literally trying to learn my game here. Got no materials. Got 3 ammos. Cannot place ANY outposts near my base because the INITIAL plague heart is still there and it takes EVERY resource producing building nearby. 


Who the hell is balancing those effects? A drunk walrus on steroid? Is this balanced around kids watching their daddy streamer for 9000 hours before starting their first game? How the hell am I supposed to learn organically if bugged systems literally forces me to take impossible (for my skill level) challenges on the other side of the map? I pretty much understood you can ignore early infestations, hordes and even missions, unless threatening your base but an heavily armed guy with X-Ray vision that steals all my supplies? A huge chunk of the map I must walk eggshells around or abandon my vehicle? Skill issues dude, just kill the plague heart man.

This game seriously affected my life by how addicting it was. It wasn't a fun addiction, more like a drug addiction, where you're just kinda holding off the side effects. 
Truth is, the game has lots of potential. Gameplay is very good, zombies are fun to kill and feel dangerous in the lethal zone and it's extremely addictive. 
However, the glitches, the lack of any personality or story, or interesting characters or anything memorable to discover is lacking. It's a big open empty sandbox with zombies and some characters that look different but feel pretty much the same. 
With future updates, I truly hope they release more content in the form of some more interesting quests that don't feel like chores, maybe hire a writer that could truly fill this sandbox with some interesting lore and story. 

""Lethal Zone update""
My expectations were low but damn.. this game is completely broken on Lethal zone. Bugs that were already pretty bad on nightmare are even worse in Lethal. I just don't get how every player is talking about this and has been talking about it since launch but the devs still don't fix it. It's always the same shit:
-Zombies spawning in front of you and behind you out of nowhere. Completely kills immersion and planning/scouting ahead. 
-You go in to search a house and a blood feral spawns in the next room or just 20 zombies out of nowhere, even though you scope the house from the outside and there's nothing in there. 
-Hordes spawn in front of you when driving and bust your car up.
-The morale counter is broken, the math never adds up. Why put stats as a feature if they can't even do simple math?? 
-Don't even get me started on the NPCs. Any fight with a human is dogshit. They're basically immortal and you're down in two shots. One time they occupied one of the settlements i wanted and then i came to kill them and I couldn't even touch them. Headshot.. with a sniper.. 10 times.. nothing..

In general there are lots of small bugs that just add up and make this game unplayable in this mode. Feels like playing the original dark souls with permadeath. I hope they fix it and i'll give it another try in the future but right now it's broken.


(Old review)
At one point you're barely scrapping by, fighting two hordes with one badass survivor not knowing if the next time you get hit it's over. Mowing through zombies with a heavy hammer and scoring headshots. The finger bitting tension and thrill of perma-death and nightmare zone are crazy good. 

And at another point, your car blows up from driving through a horde that spawned a meter in front of you, a juggernaut hits you from 20m away and kills your survivor, zombies visibly spawn out of thin air, enclave enemies that headshot you from behind walls... 
Getting attached to the characters you invest your time into developing that have no personality besides the one you imagine they have, most survivors are just ugly af, feels like 5 voice actors for all of them - common to have three survivors that sound the same in your community. 

Basically speaking, if the game works, it's a great game but very often it doesn't. It goes from tough but fair to fuck you, you died, you suck, have fun dipshit.",1606061161,1695801947,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Melee combat sucks. It's almost like a turn based system. You swing and if you are in the correct distance it connects, otherwise you just miss.  Sometimes you may swing a little early, but the animation takes a while to load up, and in that time the enemy could be right in your face but your swing still misses. It's pretty awful if you ask me. You cannot fight two at a time, it will only hit the one zombie...I've only been able to hit multiple zombies maybe once or twice total. 

I wish the game was just shooting. The shooting is better, but the ammo is scarce so the game tries to push you to stealth and melee. Both areas of games I generally loathe. 

Switching between characters seemed like a neat idea, but I don't like it after about 15 minutes. I just want to build up one character and not have to micromanage every single person in the settlement. 

Also, the game seems to just take to long because the characters you are given just have the worst skills and you can't change them or give them new, useful, ones.  

I just gets kinda boring when every time you see a horde the best thing you can do is run.  Then when you see human enemies, if they hit you, you get stuck in a animation where you can never escape. Their hits stun you, then before you can regain control, they hit you again. I had one enemy do this until my character was completely downed. Got up, and had 3 of em doing it to me. The stupid AI that was with me was no where to be found, probably shooting at some zombies a plot over, doing their best to attract everything in the area. 

It's just very mid. If the focus was more on action and shooting, I would probably like the game way more. It's like if Dying Light (the first one, the second is absolute trash) had a terrible combat system. That game would suck too. Luckily the melee combat is one of the best in any game.  I just don't get why people make a game and make it melee focus, then put very little into the melee combat. It's literal button mashing and waiting for an animation to do the work for you. 

haven't had many bugs though, no crashes yet, but UI isn't very friendly. 

Just know that this is going to be a slog if you pick it up, and not the enjoyable kind. I really hope there is something on the horizon in this game that makes it all worthwhile, because right now I feel pretty let down.",1695654504,1695654504,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Linking accounts didn't carry save progress or legacy pool for me, only achievements. SoD2 is one of the best zombie survival games I've played and by the looks of things, the Juggernaut edition is even better.

The multiplayer experience is also better than some reviews, especially the very short ones, make it sound like. You can still develop character skills, get loot and deposit them to your own supply locker, use basic base facilities like crafting and repairs and trade with enclaves. Your entire community is essentially an off-screen guest in your host's campaign, but you need to return to your own campaign to fully manage recovery of survivors and you can only gain influence, not standing, for guesting. In short, you can do almost everything you'd do in your own campaign and all players get a bit more out of the world with easier takedowns and more loot per location. I can't really see it as anything other than win-win, but if you're expecting to form a joint community with another player, that's not really possible, although you could still share valuable resources like blood samples by hopping between campaigns.

The only actual obstacle we experienced in multiplayer so far was having to spend some time to investigate and disable VPN to make multiplayer sessions possible. No other errors here.

Especially compared to SoD1, which I loved, this is a very action focused-game where zombies around the base always respawn so the world loses all sense of progression. Characters are in a strategic sense mainly just tokens for your base to be able to build certain improvements, so you will be nitpicky about them only for their 5th special ability. Also they look often the same as others (there are a few recurring phenotypes) and when they are in the base they just pretend to work something but it feels fake, since it has no effect at all. I don't get a sense of a simulated world this way. They also don't properly use the towers like they did in SoD1 where tower positioning meant a lot for defending the base and the surrounding.

Small and big boss enemies are bullet sponges and ferals are not even nearly scary anymore. The game feels like it is on easy mode compared to SoD1 with the exception that sometimes you or your ally will just suddenly die and you won't know why exactly. For example once i drove into a boomer and my ally then just died seconds later after i ran out of the gas immediately. I had just cured them beforehand, this was my last straw to uninstall because it felt extremely punishing but at the same time totally unpredictable. The juggernaut enemies are bullet sponges and you clunkily fight them in melee or use a lot of ammo and explosives on them, but they will also respawn anyway, so what's the point of even killing them? Let them stay around your base and graze the grass like cows. Apparently that's what the game designers wanted.

Fighting felt much better in SoD1- now it is just about hitting left mouse and dodge a lot. We are also missing cool moves in this game like kick jumps. In fact the finishing moves cost a lot of stamina and slow you down, melee just feels like a chore now. The companion Ai got  better and they shoot now! But the characters in your community won't go out to scavenge or anything anymore and need your help to get back, so overall the game and the side-mission and the world feel kind of dead, since all there is to it is to kill plague hearts and pimp your base or do main story missions to progress. The main campaign has no real story anyway, which is sad. Heartlands has a linear progression and story but all characters for the base are ""unique"" and you can't get new ones if they die, so you have to pick the ones that exist and there is no random encounters or random recruitment at all, unlike in SoD1.

I particularly hate the plague hearts in SoD2 and what they represent: I hate how they block the buildings around them from being claimable as outposts, i hate how they require me to get close to them to destroy them (bullet sponge), i hate the aoe effects on me when i m close and trying to kill them, forcing me to use explosives and bullets or cheese them from afar with long range, i hate how it just consistently throws 200 zombies at me while the heart is dying, which means I need to be super fast or I have no chance. Basically you just need to craft very strong explosives and nuke it at once, if you try to play stealth or tactical or smart, you will just lose. SoD has become a pure action game in that sense. Plague hearts on their own already kind of ruin the experience for me, it feels totally out of place and just like some grind-and-destroy crap. SoD1 was much cooler with a world that you slowly cleared out and expanded over instead of nuking some ridiculously overpowered spawn-point represented by a heart (if not insta-nuked, then they re ridiculously weak). SoD1 felt more like a simulation and more free and open.

SoD1 required you to sneak. In this game i never sneaked, it is irrelevant. Also boarding up windows is not possible anymore, but this was a cool feature! It felt like the survivors are actually smart out there for doing things like this instead of just idling. The friendly groups on the map now feel boring and annoying and if you recruit one of them the rest just.... runs off screen away and disappears (wtf??? are they afraid of my friendship? is this real life?) even though they may be ""allied"" by now with you.

The whole game is built around systems and crafting and honestly if you enjoy that go for it, but the whole survival-simulation feeling is gone with a world that just respawns bosses and zombies all over constantly and your outposts dont give any help with that at all. SoD 1 was a survival simulation, it was tactical, it was cool, it was fun. In SoD1 you could place outposts intelligently to burn all hordes approaching your base, that was so cool! And I often didn't just take the ""biggest"" base but one that is located well for this purpose.

SoD2 on the other hand feels like an action game with a coop feature, but it feels somewhat bland to me. Sad. A lot of features are great, improvements are great, but the stuff they ruined makes those improved and new features kind of worthless to me.",1669416652,1695471476,False,88,13,0.624059617519378662,0,True,False,False

I am a big fan of Walking Dead that's why I was looking for a game which is open world zombie survival and has base building and this is it. The game has a great community with a developer team who cares about feedback. There are dev and community streams. Still getting updates in 2023 after 5 YEARS! Before you think this game can do more than what is currently available, let me just say that it can, but the development team has limited resources because most of them have already left SoD2 behind to work on State of Decay 3 with the developers of Gears of War. They use this game to get feedback on things to create a better new game (SoD3) with these new features. Unfortunately because of the limit of the engine and the capacity of the team will lower the chances of big changes or updates I just say it to keep this in mind. You can play this game however you want. There are multiple maps, bases and customizable difficulty options. You can build your base however you want there are slots and in that slots you can build different stations. There is a 4 player online coop with limitations but at least we have and there is a chance that this will get a revamp because of a multiplayer survey. I don't wanna tell you more, there is much more to discover just get it and try it out! Definitely worth 30€, but if you can't buy it for that much, then wait for the sale and buy it then.

Update on September 21 - The developers confirmed this in a developer stream, I heard it and I am happy to hear this message. -> Wushu Studios will continue to support State of Decay 2 with new content moving forward, as most of Undead Labs is now working on State of Decay 3.

Undead Labs keep up this great work!

It's actually a fun zombie survival game, with lots and lots of unique mechanics of your Ai communities and safehouse mechanics, but oh my god, the minor annoyance and bugs that exists in this game was too many, it piles up and makes you frustrated. You'll know what i mean if you atleast played about 3-5 playthrough already.

There weren't that many major bugs to say, but when it exists, it hits you HARD. You can lose hours of progress and lose some cool stuff just by playing normally, at any random time. Car's missing, bad PVE (npc) gameplay, unreliable basic movement that either makes small accident, or poff, your character's dead. Even though the game's bug that makes your characters dead and eaten by piles of zombies. These moments that make the game just doesnt worth playing anymore imo. 

(UPDATED) DONT BUY THIS GAME, FULL OF BUGS, THOUSANDS OF MAJOR GLITCHES AND ANNOYING MECHANICS THAT'LL JUST FUCKED YOUR PROGRESS. FUCK THIS GAME, FUCK YOU

You spend times and times learning the advanced gameplay, just for the game to shit on you. This ofc can be frustating on harder difficulty, making me question things like ""why bother challenging myself for an harder difficulty playthrough, when the game is not even POLISHED to give you the satisfaction of fighting through that challenge itself?"" it sucks.

I love this game, i really do. But it doesnt worth playing anymore, especially after doing almost everything that can happen in the game, and what's left is the harder difficulty, but again, dont bother playing the harder difficulty when in easier diff, you can just get shitted on by RNG bugs that this game has.

The consistent updates doesnt even fix these issues, i just with they give this game more time to be cooked in the oven, for it to be more polished.",1687619988,1694930235,False,1,0,0.502074718475341797,0,True,False,False

It's not perfect, but it does keep drawing you back in to try different maps, and different difficulties.

On Standard and Dread difficulty, it's actually quite easy when you know what you're doing. You could stockpile pipe bombs and clear the maps even without a full team. Or sit back and explore the game without worrying too much about sieges, etc.

On Nightmare difficulty it becomes more challenging and you really need to plan.

Also the infections seem to be a challenge but nothing you can't fight.  

But there's so much I miss, too: The characters felt like empty vessels to me, they don't really engage with each other like people do, they don't really talk, they felt like puppets. There's no real story or plot in the game, other than surviving (which wouldn't be bad if the people I play felt real to me). 

I also got bored pretty soon. I upgraded my base and had to start talking with other survivors, maybe recruiting them: But really, I couldn't care less about more lifeless puppets in my base! And all of them wanted food! Food I carefully collected!

I'm a long time player of this game (since launch), but only recently started playing again after update 33 (i stopped updating game at v29 because i didnt like the way things were going and no way to reverse any updates)

So players like me who had to turn off internet and all things to avoid updating SOD2 can rest easy as Update 33 clears most annoying problem- the infestations

i always play at Nightmare difficulty  (sometimes standard to farm things) and currently on 4th playthrough after the update, what's amazing about this update is you can completely clear a map, without having a single infestation (barring mission ones) there will be missions in plague territory to make you go there and cause ruckus like - builder and pillage (for materials) or a survivor who shows up to destroy a plague heart..

in short avoid any mission in which you have to disturb a heart unless you are ready to kill it and the adjacent hearts (in NM and lethal hearts are clustered so killing one wakes the nearby hearts, avoid screamers as their screams can wake a heart as well.

also killing the screamers now clears infestations which clears a lot of trouble, as you can you a arrow or bullet from a distance and infestation cleared!

all in all the game now gives you breathing room, as long as you dont screw around hearts no sieges or infestations will bother you.  

stealth has become a major skill for all survivors, without it you will barely survive now, you can even stealth kill as many zoms as you want in plague territory and the heart will not wake (not applicable for freaks).

by Aidanator (with help)

State of Decay 2 is an awesome game, offering a captivating experience that immerses players into the heart of a zombie apocalypse. While it has its shortcomings, the game's overall fun factor (based almost entirely on the unique community-building aspect), and replay-ability, make it a worthwhile investment.

[b]Fun Factor (4/5): [/b]
State of Decay 2 delivers an incredibly enjoyable gaming experience. The constant struggle for survival against hordes of zombies keeps the adrenaline pumping, making every decision a matter of life and death. Whether you're scavenging for supplies, fortifying your base, or exploring the post-apocalyptic world, the game offers an engaging and addictive gameplay loop.

[b]Community Building (4.5/5): [/b]
One of the game's standout features is its community-building aspect. Building and managing a group of survivors adds a layer of depth and immersion that sets State of Decay 2 apart. It truly captures the essence of surviving in a zombie-infested world, where every member's skills and traits matter. Forming bonds and facing moral dilemmas as you lead your community is a unique and satisfying experience.

[b]Customizable Difficulty (4/5): [/b]
The game caters to both new and experienced players with its extensive difficulty customization options. Whether you're seeking a more relaxed, story-driven experience or a hardcore survival challenge, State of Decay 2 allows you to fine-tune the gameplay to your preferences, ensuring that everyone can find their ideal level of challenge.

[b]Map Variety (3.5/5): [/b]
While I appreciate the diversity of maps, Trumbull Valley stands out as the most memorable due to its unique missions and distinctive character. Unfortunately, the other maps tend to lose their novelty after a couple of playthroughs. I hope the developers introduce new maps before the release of the third game to keep the experience fresh.

[b]Voice Actor Diversity (3/5): [/b]
One of the game's [u]glaring issues[/u]is the lack of voice actor diversity. Multiple community members often share the same voice, and the absence of regional accents feels odd. Adding more variety in voice acting would significantly enhance immersion and make each survivor feel like a unique character.

[b]Clothing Options (3/5): [/b]
While the clothing options in the game are decent, I wish there were more choices. Creating distinct outfits for all community members becomes a challenge when you desire both uniqueness and personal style. Expanding the wardrobe options would improve the customization aspect of the game.

[b]Supply Collection and Automation (4/5): [/b]
The mechanics of collecting supplies and the impact on your home site's functionality are well-executed. The gradual automation of supply collection is a satisfying progression element, making resource management a crucial part of the game's strategy.

[b]Leader Types (3.5/5): [/b]
The option to choose from leader types like builder, sheriff, warlord, or trader adds replay-ability. However, it does become repetitive once you've experienced each leader's missions multiple times. Adding more leader types or varied mission outcomes would enhance the game's longevity.

[b]Conclusion: [/b]
State of Decay 2 is [u]undeniably[/u] one of my favourite games, offering a unique and captivating zombie apocalypse experience. While it has its flaws, including limited voice actor diversity and a lack of map variety, the game's fun factor, community-building mechanics, and customizable difficulty options more than compensate for these shortcomings. It's easy to get into and definitely worth the price. I can't wait for the third game in the series, but I'm frustrated by the lack of information about it. State of Decay 2 is a [u]must-play[/u] for anyone looking for an immersive survival experience in a post-apocalyptic world.

Currently my favorite zombie game. Legitimately open world, nothing holding you back. Very relaxing and fun to scavenge for supplies while driving around a large area.
[list]
[*]Story content is limited. You can play Heartland for a good story, and then the Trumbull Valley map afterwards to continue it somewhat, but then other than the tutorial missions there isn't a coherent story revolving around your base.
[*]Spawns are annoying. Zombies are created spontaneously by noise, so there isn't a good way to clear an area and then loot it carelessly. Any blind spot is an open spawn location for new zombies.
[*]There are only 4 types of 'freaks'. Feels like I'm in the first Left 4 Dead again. Hopefully they'll make more in the next game.
[*]State of Decay 3 was announced awhile ago but apparently it's in development hell. May never see it.
[*]State of Decay 2 still has infrequent content updates. The most recent one was 'Heart Attack' which overhauled the way plague hearts, infestations, and sieges work.
[*]Some aspects of the game are too game-y and immersion breaking, like the Bounty Broker and most radio calls. I'd avoid them if you're looking for an immersive zombie survival experience.
[*]Multiplayer is good and bad. It's host based, so be prepared for lag. And when you want to play with friends (not in Daybreak) you only have the option to join their world on one of your characters and help them out - only one player can really progress in the game in one multiplayer session. Hopefully we get real multiplayer in State of Decay 3.

I remember it being a blast on my Xbox the very first time I played it. Having a survivor catch the plague, his vehicle explodes back when night time was *night time.* Breaking my melee weapon and exhausting all of my ammo as dozens of blood plague zombies hunted me down. *Finally* escaping and running to the other side of the road hiding inside bushes while turning off my flashlight, seeing literally nothing but their deathly glowing red eyes as they charged ahead trying to hunt Jontraye down.

Basically no health, no stamina, completely alone, completely helpless. Yet after 10 minutes of desperate survival, quietly hoping above all else that they wouldn't spot me, I found a car for Jontraye, barely getting him back.

This was back before the difficulty modes, when you had 3 entire hours to fix the plague. Jontraye had 50 minutes left, a dead man in today's meta.

But it didn't matter, it was exhilirating, almost as great as my experience with STALKER.

Annd then I kept playing and figured out all the mechanics, making it braindead easy.

I eventually got this on PC, setting it to nightmare as I realised dread and normal just didn't cut it. And found it to be the most ridiculously challenging, annoying thing I've played in a *minute.*

My mistakes don't feel like mistakes. Anywhere you go, anything you do, zombies will literally spawn out of thin air at random to surround you. You helped a survivor literally 50 meters from your home base? Here's 3 f*cking juggernauts out of nowhere because f*ck you!

Doesn't matter that I destroyed every single plague heart around there (the siege system is one of the few new things I can say is actually great). The game treats me like I just wandered dead center into the most infected area of the map.

There is no planning. Because planning would imply that you could somehow circumvent and outsmart the hordes. Tailoring your playstyle to your survivor. You arm yourself to the teeth *every* single time because no matter where you go, the game treats you the same.

I go to clear an infestation barely 200 meters from my base and I'm getting hordes of Ferals and 3 screamers to attract an incomprehensible amount of zombies.

*How the hell* are we still alive if *that* many zombies are wandering around our home turf? Why is there no such thing as actual *territory* where we and our enclaves clear out chunks of land to hold and maintain to give us breathing room to scavenge and explore?

There is difficulty, and then there is bullsh*t difficulty. This is the latter. There isn't a way to utilize the game mechanics in a clever way to avoid these threats and keep missions simple/quiet. Legimately you know the best way to get around these annoying mechanics?

Cheese the hell out of the game and quit so they despawn! I am not joking. The game actively incentivizes this, because what the hell am I supposed to do if I have 3 juggs wandering right outside my base at all times? On *nightmare* difficulty I would like to add once again. I didn't make a mistake that the game punished me for, like making way too much noise or allowing the infestations to grow out of control, the game just decided that's what needed to happen.

The game does not punish you for mistakes, it punishes you for *existing.* It'll no doubt be fun for some, but for me this is ridiculous. Punish me because I screwed up and didn't respect and pay attention to the mechanics. If I die in Doom Eternal or Turbo Overkill it's because I overextended and failed to pay attention to the enemies attack patterns.

If I lose in XCOM 2 it's because I screwed around with my technology and didn't research enough or gather the resources needed and fell behind.

I cleared every plague heart, and root out every infestation that pops up near my base as *soon* as it arrives. What did I do wrong to draw such extreme reactions?

Also, Juggernauts and Ferals suck. Ferals I you can at least headshot, but Juggs are literally just swing and shoot a massive healthbar until they slowly die... When they can kill you in like 3 hits.",1692250987,1692251124,False,1,0,0.510309278964996338,1,True,False,False

There also is very few, if any games like State of Decay on the market at this current time. The game is centered around you and your community and the different personally unique events and stories that unfold, similar to a ""Walking Dead"" experience. There is very little in the way of a main story (unlike it's predecessor), other than idle chatter about the lore through radio messages. You can ""beat"" the game by completing a final set of objectives on each map (of which there are five) after destroying all the ""plague hearts"", which is the main driving force and threat for building up your community. After completing a map, you can choose to continue to another map with your current community, or just start fresh with new survivors. The game is pretty much endless.

 The core gameplay loop of looting for supplies, killing zombies, and base building is satisfying, if a little bit repetitive, but is good enough to keep the player entertained for 10-15 hours minimum on a first playthrough, and potentially hundreds more if the loop clicks with said player. Combat is simple, but effective, with a satisfying blood and dismember system and punchy gunplay. There are special ""freak"" zombies such as screamers and ferals to help break up the monotony of the basic zombies. Combat difficulty is also freely adjustable along with a slew of other aspects of the game's systems, such as resource scarceness and community management difficulty, far more customizable  than some other games.

The game is currently, and has been on a live service dev cycle for the past 3-4 years, with regular content updates that improve on and deepen the already unique gameplay systems. Undead Labs has stated they don't plan on stopping support anytime soon, with several ""new"" features already in development at this time. It is unknown if support will cease once State of Decay 3 is released.

Overall, if you like sandbox survival games, State of Decay 2 brings a unique take on the genre that has certainly fostered a small but dedicated playerbase that will only grow larger once State of Decay 3 comes out. Despite how unique State of Decay 2 is, it certainly doesn't get everything right and has a handful of flaws that can be fixed with updates, or iterated upon in a sequel. It is not a 9/10 game, but it doesn't have to be. it is a perfectly entertaining and serviceable 7/10 game, which is why i draw the comparison with Dragon's Dogma, as that game is a very similar unique 7/10 RPG that earned it's fanbase for it's innovation to the genre.

Pros:

- Challenging Gameplay: The game provides a unique challenge. Encounter with 3-5 zombies can be fatal.

- RPG Element with Permadeath: The inclusion of permadeath adds depth to the RPG aspect, making each character's survival vital, as losing a character means losing all the progress made.

- Expansive Open-World Environment: The game boasts a vast open-world map, providing players with ample exploration opportunities.

- Base Building Mechanics: Players can engage in base building activities, adding strategic elements to the gameplay.

- Engaging Quests: Some of the quests in the game are well-crafted and offer an engaging experience.


Cons:

- Limited Inventory Capacity: The inventory, particularly backpacks and cars, has a maximum capacity of 8 slots, and certain items cannot be stacked. However, it's noteworthy that 8 guns can be carried in a backpack/car, which raises concerns.

- Lack of a Substantial Storyline: The game lacks a comprehensive storyline, which may diminish the overall narrative experience.

- Repetitive Gameplay: The gameplay can become somewhat repetitive, with a cycle of looting and returning to the base frequently.

- Limited Interactivity with Enclaves: Interactions with enclaves (neighbors) tend to be one-sided, with requests for assistance or assistance turning hostile if not met.

- Weapon Durability Issues: The durability of weapons seems to be a concern, as they tend to break easily.


Overall Impression:

Despite its shortcomings, I find myself still enjoying the game. I anticipate dedicating approximately 50-100 hours to the gameplay, after which I may take a break.

During these supply runs, you navigate around hordes of zombies, trying to pick them apart or just sneak past them.

You're also expected to liberate zones of the map by destroying plague hearts, pillars of flesh which draw zombies and create harder zones. Usually it's a head on charge where you unload explosives on the heart and roll over zombies with your SUV. 10/10, would recommend.

If you are new to the game, it is pretty tough from the start and all characters are perma-death. If they die - they die. Do not let that sway you though - it adds a solid amount of tension to the game and forces you to make good choices. Running in blasting may not always be wise. Pay attention! You can become overwhelmed in seconds.

I have had this game for a while now, and recently returned to check out the Update 33 goodness! They keep on adding more and more to this game. Love the changes personally, after you have 'end gamed' it a couple times, it can tend to get a bit easy, but Update 33 added a lot of challenge. 

While end game can be a bit easy sometimes though, even on higher difficulty; I was just watching a video with a streamer and some devs who were discussing Update 34 and the extra 'curveballs'/challenges they are planning that should spice up the end game quite a bit.  

The game runs well, no issues with crashing. Don't think it's ever crashed on me at all. Although sometimes in multiplayer, people who join up will get occasional frame rate slowdowns. They are kinda bad (but usually very short), and they don't persist long for me. Just a few 'here and there'. 

Honestly with any Steam game, one doesn't need to look any further in the reviews than 'Time Played' - I'm at 330 hours, and can't wait to get playing again today.

Summary - it's a really fun Survival Shooter/Strategy game, with good company/development support. Very few bugs and the small ones I have found don't impact gameplay enough to be concerned about it.",1691158093,1691158093,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is the best zombie game I think I've ever played. There is so much freedom to do what you want. I enjoy the fact you can take over any place and make it into a base/outpost. Making you feel like you can really make do with what you can in the zombie apocalypse. Furthermore I enjoy the atmosphere. The random ambiance/sounds I hear in the distance during the day and night definitely gives it a huge immersive feel. The level design/maps are done very well. They look like something out of a zombie movie or comic you can actually explore!

My only complaint about this game is the fact whenever I join a friend's game. For some reason I lag or hitch even on a high end PC which shouldn't happen. My friends even on console say they have the same issue as well joining games. For some reason it seems laggish and I'm not sure if it's because of the huge world or something else?

Last but not least for complaints. I'm going to tell you now... I'm refunding every game that forces automatic controls from now on. Anything from climbing, opening doors, reloading guns, anything related I will refund the game instantly if I even see it. If there isn't a way to disable it. Because I've lost multiple survivors because of the auto climbing system. IT IS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE and a lazy way to do something for games. I'm so tired of seeing auto climbing in games because it's just a frustrating thing that shouldn't be in the game. 

Besides that... If you're the type of person who wants a free roam zombie game with a ton of immersion and a lot of places to explore. This is by far the best zombie game I've found. About time a company did it right for once!",1652999467,1691036390,True,0,0,0.582933664321899414,4,True,False,False

(RELEASE DATE) #the dark ages

When this game came out day one let me tell you it was ROUGH AND SCARY it was full of bugs that were game braking like cars going crazy after crashing or just driving normally, zombies spawning mid air and invisible zombies… that was fun

Now all those bugs have been fixed so thank god :)

(CONTENT)

So if you’re familiar with the first game, state of decay 2
isn’t so different which is not a bad thing at all. sod 2 is pretty much a more improved version of the first game with better mechanics, visuals and graphics 

• Survivors 

Survivors have different skills, traits and special skills like mechanics or electronic and more

Survivors sadly don’t feel like important characters they feel more like resources that you gotta keep around

If a survivor dies and they had a special skill you liked you can just find a new one later and hopefully they have the same skill or you can read a skill book

• Leader types 

Sod 2 has different leader types is something that sod 1 didn’t have

Each leader type provides different facilities you can build and my personal favorite is the trader, trading can come in handy once you looted the whole map or at least half of it 

NOTE: You can only have one leader at a time 

(Sheriff) allows you to make field hospital facility 

(Builder) allows you to make sniper big pp tower facility 

(Warlord) allows you to make a armory facility 

(Trader) allows you to make a trading center facility 

• Base building 

The building in here is not like let’s say fallout 4 where you can place things anywhere it’s more like building in certain spots the base has to offer

You can build anything in said spot as long as you meet the requirements and have the required materials

• different building spot sizes 

Sod 2 offers two different building spots size, small and large 

• Base supply Locker 

The locker is where you put all the things you find while looting, you can put weapons, health items, misc and maybe even a zombie if u want 

• Clothing 

Sod 2 offers different types of outfits they aren’t nothing special but it’s nice to be able to change your survivors clothes 

• Bounty challenges 

These are mostly to keep the player entertained, you unlock certain things like weapons, cars, weapon mods, clothing and certain facility mods 

These things you unlock are exclusive to the bounty 
challenges only 

• Morale 

your survivors will have a morale system this is a pretty big thing when it comes to survivors 

Morale is important to keep up cause if you don’t your survivors will start arguing with each other and it can lower everyone’s morale this can lead to survivors wanting to leave the community

How do i raise morale?

You can raise it by having certain facilities

(Kitchen)

This will allow you to cook a meal for all survivors in the base 

(lounge facility)

With this your survivors can play board games, watch movies, have a few drinks and maybe some sweet butt sex afterwards 

(Having enough beds)

Survivors don’t like to cuddle with each other :( 

(Having power and water)

Important for certain facilities to work 

Or just kill everyone and problem solved 💀

• Outpost

These are little checkpoints that carry over your home supply locker and can also provide small benefits such as raising morale

• Different types of Outpost and benefits 

(House outpost) gives you two extra beds in the community 

(Food outpost) will give food daily 

(Power outpost) will give your base power plus morale 

(Water outpost) will provide water plus morale 

(Ammo outpost) will give ammo daily 

(Medicine outpost) will give everyone hardcore drugs to get wasted

(Gas station outpost) will give gas daily

You can upgrade outposts to increase the benefits but it will require materials 

(ENCLAVES) 

These are survivors that will appear in the game after some time, they are really needy which it can get annoying and they’ll request for help almost every day

• Enclave missions 

When they request for help they mostly want something like food or materials sometimes even a power generator cause apparently the game made u their lord and savior and they need u 24\7

• What do they offer? 

They offer benefits for your community they aren’t all that great but some can be good

• How do i friend them?

To friend an enclave you just gotta help them when they request for you, after a couple of missions you’ll become allies 

• Can I trade with them?

Yes you can trade with enclaves as long as you’re in good terms with them

• Enclave status 

Enclaves will have like a relationship with you, if you keep helping the relationship goes up but if u don’t help them it will go down and if u keep avoiding them they will become hostile 

• Hostile survivors

This wasn’t a thing in sod 1 it was kinda unexpected that we got to see that in sod 2 

Sadly they only appear as enclaves or from a mission so you won’t find them in the open just looting or walking around 

(MULTIPLE MAPS)

Sod 1 only had a single map but sod 2 offers 6 maps

(GAME DIFFICULTY)

At release there wasn’t any difficulty choice which at first it didn’t felt like a big deal but later on it started getting easy and kinda boring that you could just play the game with zero consequences 

So they added 5 difficulties 

(Green zone) The easiest 

(Standard zone) the normal mode

(Dread zone) pretty much the standard zone but a little harder 

(Nightmare zone) hard mode

(Lethal zone) for crazy people like me

• What’s the difference between each difficulty?

Each difficulty increases zombies, less enclaves, increases the human enemies damage and the zombies, your community uses more supplies like food cause they wanna be fat B I T C H E S, certain buildings have already been looted and less cars

(SPECIAL ZOMBIES) 

the special zeds aren’t something we haven’t seen before we have the Screamer, Juggernaut, Bloaters and Ferals

(ONLINE MULTIPLAYER)

Online was a massive deal for sod and a lot of people wanted the first sod to have it but they couldn’t sadly but sod 2 offers online. At lunch it was buggy but now it’s probably smooth and i say probably cause I haven’t played it with another player in some time 

(MAIN OBJECTIVE)

The main objective is to survive but also to destroy something called plague hearts, special zombies that can infect you with their blood if they scratch you or bite you, keep getting bitten and your character will get infected 

What happens if your character is infected? You’ll receive a meter that shows you how long you have until you make a cure cause if u don’t you’ll die and turn into a plague zombie 

• How do i make a cure

You need a infirmary facility there u can make a cure but u need to collect plague samples you get it after killing plague zombies, they don’t always drop it when u kill them, best way to get samples is by destroying a plague heart

• How do i destroy plague hearts? 

Simple just go up to one and then say hi to it then you BEAT THE S H I T OUT OF IT UNTIL IT SCREAMS AND DIES FROM SO MUCH PAIN!!!!

Just be aware that hitting the plague heart too much will call plague zombies to its location, I recommend that you hit it like 5 times and wait until zombies come, kill them and then continue on with your BDSM play with Mr. Plague heart or Mrs plague heart or whatever 

(Do i recommend this?) 

Yes absolutely the gameplay will get repetitive over time but it’s not so bad if you play with higher difficulty making u play the game a bit more tactical

(Rating) 8/10

Props to Undead labs for listening to the community and adding countless updates since day one.

I had much more fun with SOD 1 and the Breakdown DLC which gradually ramped up the difficulty over time and gave you a reason to play with a team for a longer time.   

Pros:    Prettier than SOD 1

Cons:  Lifeless  NPC enclaves.     A tiny indie game like Survivalist: Invisible Strain did this so much better
           No scaling difficulty as you clear levels which limits your play time with any group.
           Repetitive,  not much changed from SOD 1.
           Quick levelling means you max survivors quickly,  like SOD 1,   which adds to the short term feel of the game.
           
Verdict:   Buy on a deep sale if you really need a short term zombie fix,

Combat and base building are ok, not amazing, but ok. Once more, simple, like some one fresh out of school put them together and were following a template from class. 
Graphics are pretty decent. The story is ok - with heart land - with the normal maps/game I'm honestly not even sure there is a story. 
Then there is the defend the hill scenario - which by the way kicks out other players when doing it with friends for no apparent reason in the middle of a wave. So, that's kind of broken.

All this aside, the game works more or less bug free. It's very simplistic and unrealistic with zombie spawning, since they always appear behind you and attack from your blind spots when there was nothing there before. 

There are minimal maps to choose from and no real randomness. Base editing/building is very simplified and some things are cemented in place. All base upgrades are not standard across the game, heartland has better/different things and a bigger base than the rest of the game. There doesn't even seem to be a point in doing things on the random maps. . .get a base, recruit people, kill zeds. . .and nothing. . .so yeah, it gets boring super fast. 

But anyone playing it should get a few hours of zombie head popping fun I guess. I hope the third one is better and less like some class room beta project. . .
I know there was some big to do about sexual harassment or some other horse dung going on with the devs, but to be honest I wonder if it was more along the lines of 'you can't do your job properly so you're not getting any more credit' and then some one cried wolf. Judging by the absolute student level work on the game I can't imagine that gender played a role in how it was developed, but more of inexperience and un-inventiveness, and when they got chewed out for it they got mad. 
Either way, I do hope the next one lives up to the video footage put out, though I am doubting it will be such high quality given the inept display of coding and system design skills displayed in this one. 
 
Do I think it's worth the price, yeah. I got some hours of fun out of it. But I'm not going to talk it up as if it were some amazing game when it wasn't. It was simply enjoyable for a short time and then got boring really fast.",1690394122,1690394122,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There's even a multiplayer mode where you just fight zombies. It's decently fun, but all of the best stuff is locked behind it, so you have to grind it to unlock everything. it does get quite tedious, but there are tools online to unlock all of its content quickly.

Instead of a building mechanic , like in most survival games today , the focus here lies in choosing the right settlement place to build your facilities of your choice to get you through the game . You always start with 3 people and a small standart base , after that you have to grow your cummunity of surviors in order to occupie a better or bigger base . You don`t can have everything at once , you always have to choose wish direction or wish facilities match your playstyle or current situation in the game . 
This game is a revised version of their of the first one . If you are new to state of decay and don`t know what game to choose . Take this one , it plays the same but has more functions and community interaction than the first one .

It's not only fun playing single player but it's hilarious when you can get three more friends to join in the zombie killing.

There's of course the standard Easy - Hard difficulities (Here being Easy, Medium, Advanced and Expert). So if you're looking for some mindless slaughtering to do you can put it on easy or if you and your friends is a tatical squad preparing for the zombie apacolypse this is a great way to start!

Also you don't have to play the first game to get into this one, all the maps and more from the first game is in this one. Even if you want to play oldschool there is a mode for that. Speaking of modes, there's Versus mode which is exactly what it sounds like, you control both the infected and the survivors in rounds. The one who ends the final map with the most points win. There is also a realism version of this mode which means the survivers can't see the green/orange/red glow around them as they used to.

There's also Survival which is aslo what it sounds like. Survive for X amount of time and you get bronze, silver or a gold medal depending on the requirments for the map you're playing.

Scavanger is the last major gamemode, here you play as survivor and infected and the objective is to fill a generator with gas. Who wins depends on which team's the fastest.

Then, finally, there's something called mutation. These are pretty much fun little mini modes. For example you have to try and survive an entire campaign on your own, you and all your teamates have katanas and can't get other weapons, you need to carry around a lawngnome to win etc.",1690309921,1690309921,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have three pieces of advice for new players:
1. Always keep these consumables on you: Health, Stamina, Ammo, Throwable, and Plague Cure. Everyone needs them.
2. Amp the difficulty until taking fights seems like a bad idea. Turn the difficulty up until having to make hard decisions becomes like breathing. You won't really enjoy the game until you do.

There is no reason this feature shouldn't be in every SINGLE PLAYER open world game.  I own the game.  If I want to reload a previous save, rather than live with the results of poorly explained mechanics, that's my choice.

To that effect, barely anything is explained in the tutorials and you often end up losing a large amount of time and work just because the game decides to spring an unexplained mechanic on you.  One wrong turn and you're screwed with no chance of actually understanding why it happened.

For instance, when confronting an NPC in an early mission, the choices you are presented with are ""I'm happy that you murdered a bunch of random people, come join our community."" or varying other responses that tell the person to leave with ""potentially"" dangerous results.  In the end, ""may become hostile"" ends up being entirely random because there's no explanation as to which choice has less of a chance of causing something to happen, which (in my case) entirely ruins your effort and hard work.

It's a very graphically beautiful game, but that's all the appeal there is for me here.  The morale system, time-restricted base building, super slow scavenging, and micro-management of every person in your community that is required to ""play"" this game makes it feel more like a job than a fun exploration experience.

I have wasted 6.5 hours on this game and I have zero desire to play it again.  The character I really enjoyed playing is permanently dead, and there's nothing that I can do about it other than start over.

It now has a very tactical level to it with plague territories and sieges that make it almost impossible to feel safe.

While technically functional, you can see how virtually every design decision made in the game was the result of indifference and apathy.  From the uninspired and inconsistent UI design, to the counter-productive map design meshing poorly with quests, to the clumsy game economy that breaks itself incredibly quickly, it's clear the ethos behind this game's design was ""let's just get it out the door so we can put it behind us and move onto the next thing"".

The encapsulation of the game is a menu option to become unstuck by teleporting you the nearest flagged ""good"" location; a concession clearly made because it was easier than fixing the locomotion mechanics.

Most zombie games involve a story, such as the Last of Us and Telltale's The Walking Dead, both tell a game about a father and their adoptive daughters and the upbringing of them, being close with them, and ultimately dealing with the loss of their fathers. Or Resident Evil, a game franchise where several hot protagonists stop the concurrent evil, be it zombies, cults or viruses. This game does none of that.

This game is interesting in the sense that it feels more like what one of those Walking Dead mobile games feel like; a tower defense. The goal of the game is that objectives of the appointed leader must be completed if you want to finish the game. Along the way, side quests would be unlock where possibly some things may relate back to the characters you play as, or objectives about helping other survivors or their groups. It feels, and probably is, random encounters, which I absolutely can applaud the game for doing so. It adds a tenseness to it which sets you on your toes, making you feel unsafe at times. On one hand, you have to deliver a cure to a sick survivor of a neighboring site. The next moment, you have to rush back to your base to defend against a hoard of zombies trying to enter. The beauty of it is that your main objectives are the story. 

The environment feels big. I don't necessarily think that it's big, I think it feels big. Overall, if you want to expand the area, clearing of plague hearts are important. If an area is close to a plague heart, it means that that place is dangerous and can't be claimed. Fortunately, plague hearts can be destroyed and ""harvested"", although I wouldn't recommend going in alone. Recruit someone before you defeat a plague heart, and reap the spoils of war, which is usually exceptionally great loot dropped by plague hearts. Unfortunately, with the affect of plague hearts, there are plague heart zombies. While usually not a threat if attacked once, your character will get infected, and constant damage by plague heart zombies will result in said character requiring help, either to be put down, or given a cure. Fortunately, those zombies drop the exact thing to make a cure for the infected, which also makes you actively want to search out for said plague hearts. Fortunately, several vehicles and amenities are open for your use to be occupied. Use bigger and better bases with more amenities to gather resources for your growing base. Use vehicles to cover more ground in this relatively big playground.

Characters have their own traits, and most have advantages and disadvantages, but ultimately everyone and anyone can become different kinds of leaders. The traits can then be further refined when used multiple times. Characters aren't exactly expendable, and so are the tools you carry. Your weapons are the next line of defense, as you wouldn't want to be fighting zombies bare handed (unless you're Chris Redfield, and even then [b] HE [/b] has guns), so your best options are to find a weapon, and go long ranged too. Guns are great, but use them sparingly, as ammo is hard to find at times. And remember, always aim for the head. Many zombie threats are present, but the common infected is the least of your concerns. There are screamers, which alert zombies of your position. Then there are bloaters, zombies which, once killed, release a toxic gas which damages your character, and vehicles too. Ferals can be dealt easily with a headshot, just like the rest of the zombies above, but once you hear it's screech, let's hope your character gets out alive. But none compare to the fearsome juggernaut, a zombie the size of your mum (I'M SORRY, IT WAS RIGHT THERE), and hot damn is it hard to kill. 

Overall, State of Decay 2 is an awesome game which I can definitely recommend to the avid zombie apocalypse fan. Two things, however; 1. I would recommend getting it on sale, and 2. There are a few bugs, but mostly minute and ignorable. So, strap on your shotguns, wear multiple long sleeved clothes, grab the nearest and most suitable weapon you can find, and remember to always count your bullets.

I recommend  not using any of the free extra content (specially the independence thing) for a more balanced experience or else you will be zip zooming through the map with much care.

Technically this one is easier with the grapple. standing executions and the special zombies are no longer a one shot kill if they pin you down. The blood plagues can be challenging if not prepared but they are not really a problem until the two last difficulty settings. 

I would say for anyone who has ever played any resource management game and zombie game will be right at home. Replay value is immense with the amount of weapons, random characters, random map plague hearts, saving and collecting characters with little stories.

As an avid fan of the genre, I can confidently say that this game is a must-play for anyone looking for an immersive and challenging experience. Let's delve into the reasons why State of Decay 2: Juggernaut Edition deserves your attention:

Vast Open-World Survival: The game's open-world setting presents a dynamic and living environment filled with undead hordes, hostile human factions, and scarce resources. You'll have to manage a group of survivors, ensuring their safety, gathering supplies, and establishing a sustainable base amidst the ever-present threat of zombies. This constantly evolving world adds depth and tension, keeping players engaged and on their toes.

Meaningful Choice and Consequences: State of Decay 2 excels in offering meaningful choices, creating a sense of agency and responsibility for your actions. Decisions made during encounters with other survivors, handling resource allocation, and managing base defenses can significantly impact the overall gameplay. The game's mechanics lead to tough choices, which adds to the sense of realism and emotional investment in your community's well-being.

Cooperative Multiplayer: The Juggernaut Edition improves the cooperative multiplayer experience, allowing you to team up with friends and face the challenges of the apocalypse together. Collaborating with other players brings a new level of excitement, camaraderie, and strategic coordination, making the game even more enjoyable.

Challenging Combat and Stealth: State of Decay 2 features combat and stealth mechanics that require skill and precision. Each character has unique traits and abilities, adding an element of diversity to gameplay and making character selection crucial.

Constructing and fortifying your base allows for better resource management, crafting, and overall survival. The need to balance supplies and secure your community keeps the game engaging and strategic.

Regular Updates and Support: The Juggernaut Edition demonstrates the developers' commitment to their player community. Regular updates and bug fixes indicate ongoing support and improvement, ensuring that the game remains enjoyable and polished.

However, despite its merits, State of Decay 2: Juggernaut Edition is not without its flaws. Some players might find the graphics and animations to be less than cutting-edge, and occasional technical issues can disrupt the immersion. Additionally, the game's difficulty can be punishing, which might discourage players who prefer a more casual experience.

In conclusion, State of Decay 2: Juggernaut Edition is a standout game in the zombie survival genre, offering a vast and dynamic world, meaningful choices, cooperative multiplayer, and challenging gameplay. Its immersive mechanics and regular updates showcase a dedicated development team, making it a compelling choice for anyone seeking an authentic and gripping zombie survival experience.",1689469120,1689469120,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Well mouse deceleration needs to die as a baked in mouse sensitivity trait, so I'll be pissed if that shows up in the next game, and I hear a lot of people echoing that sentiment. What this game does well is probably that it's the right level of broad. They design wide without going so far overboard that there's no hope of them fixing this or that broken or awkward or poorly optimized aspect of gameplay (I'm looking at you, 7 days 2 die). It's design is tight and at it's foundations the gameplay mechanics are fun. I'd REALLY appreciate the ability to fortify bases rather than just build amenities in them, especially considering upon scouting a potential base location one of my guys said 'with a little fortification this could be home' or something to that effect. The zombies just pouring over walls from all directions with no way to actually effect the defenses is a pisstake when there are planks and sheet metal and tool trollies brimming with gear lying all over the place. Too easy? Tie fortification into a separate skill tree so only guys who're forty can build forts.

All that said, this did it for me during a time where I was thoroughly disenchanted with gaming and struggling to find anything that'd catch my interest, so support these guys until they sell out and then we can burn them with the rest.

Good job, Undead Labs. You've made a genuinely good game and don't think I haven't noticed you continue to update it.

As a fan of the first game, I was eagerly awaiting its sequel, and I can confidently say that it exceeded all my expectations.

The game's open-world setting is a breathtakingly immersive landscape teeming with danger and opportunity. The attention to detail is remarkable, from the decaying buildings to the hauntingly beautiful landscapes, creating an atmosphere that truly feels post-apocalyptic. The graphics are stunning, bringing the world to life with vivid colors and realistic animations.

What sets State of Decay 2 apart is its emphasis on community and resource management. As you navigate through the world, you'll encounter diverse survivors, each with their own skills and personalities. Building and maintaining your base, managing resources, and making tough decisions that impact the survival of your community add a layer of strategic depth that keeps you engaged for hours on end.

The gameplay itself is a perfect balance of action and strategy. The combat mechanics are fluid and satisfying, and the variety of weapons and vehicles at your disposal makes every encounter a unique experience. Whether you choose to engage in stealthy tactics or go all-out guns blazing, the game offers ample freedom to play your way.

Multiplayer integration is another highlight of State of Decay 2. Collaborating with friends in the vast open world, sharing resources, and tackling missions together is an absolute blast. The cooperative gameplay adds an extra layer of excitement and creates memorable moments of triumph and survival.

State of Decay 2 is a masterpiece in the zombie survival genre. Its immersive world, engaging gameplay, and emphasis on community and strategy make it an unforgettable experience.

The game boasts a handful of systems that play off of one another quite well.

The combat is decent and even on standard difficulty, I found myself having to be tactical with how I approached hordes and infestations. Throw in some random events, basic faction relations, and character skill progression akin to RimWorld, and you've got dozens of hours worth of content to enjoy.

My only ""complaint"" about the game is that it lacks the polish of most triple AAA titles - the voice acting is a little hit or miss and the character models are... interesting.

Rating: ⭐⭐⭐½

State of Decay 2 Juggernaut Edition presents an ambitious open-world zombie survival experience that has its fair share of strengths and weaknesses. Undead Labs has made notable improvements with the Juggernaut Edition, but a few persistent issues prevent it from reaching its full potential.

One of the standout features of State of Decay 2 is its focus on community and resource management. As a player, you are responsible for building and maintaining a group of survivors, each with their own strengths, weaknesses, and personal goals. The need to scavenge for supplies, fortify your base, and make tough decisions regarding the survival of your community adds depth and urgency to the gameplay.

The Juggernaut Edition brings several enhancements to the game, including improved graphics, bug fixes, and additional content. The updated visuals, while not groundbreaking, offer a noticeable improvement over the original release, making the post-apocalyptic world more immersive. The inclusion of all previously released DLC and expansion packs provides extra missions and challenges to extend the gameplay experience.

However, despite these improvements, State of Decay 2 still suffers from some technical issues and repetitive gameplay elements. The game's performance can be inconsistent, with occasional frame rate drops and glitches that can disrupt the immersion. The combat mechanics, while serviceable, lack depth and can feel repetitive after a while. The missions and objectives also tend to follow a predictable formula, leading to a sense of repetition in the overall gameplay loop.

The multiplayer aspect of State of Decay 2 adds an interesting dynamic, allowing players to team up with friends or other survivors online. Cooperative play brings a sense of camaraderie and shared responsibility, making the experience more enjoyable. However, the lack of meaningful player interaction and limited cooperative activities can leave the multiplayer experience feeling somewhat shallow.

On the positive side, the game world of State of Decay 2 is expansive and diverse, with multiple maps to explore and scavenge. Each area has its unique challenges and resources, encouraging players to venture out and discover new locations. The unpredictable nature of the game's AI-controlled survivor NPCs and the emergent events that occur throughout the world add a sense of realism and unpredictability to the survival experience.

Overall, State of Decay 2 Juggernaut Edition is a mixed bag. While it offers an engaging survival concept, solid multiplayer options, and some improvements over the original release, it falls short in certain areas. Technical issues, repetitive gameplay elements, and a lack of depth in combat mechanics hold it back from achieving greatness.

If you're a fan of the zombie survival genre and enjoy managing resources and building a community, State of Decay 2 Juggernaut Edition can provide hours of enjoyable gameplay. However, if you're seeking a more polished and refined experience, you may find yourself frustrated by its shortcomings.",1688773430,1688773430,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Very difficult when you get one shot by hostile survivors, that is not the issue but when i got killed by the 2 survivors as soon as i switched to my other survivor in the base. He get's all of a sudden teleported inside the hostile camp and gets insta killed. In my eyes my character just all of a sudden stands up in the hostile base and gets insta downed and screaming for help. While one enemy beats me with a bat the other is shooting at me with a gun. 100% bugged. The rest of the gaming time was fine but that really bugged me.

On xbox there are no such bugs and whenever you aim around the character jumps off a platform or whatever he's standing on to a lower platform. That ****'s up a lot of moments when especially on top of a car is the only thing keeping you alive.

Story: It's alright but very repeating, destroying plague hearts is the story and to build up your base
Side mission: Very few but all in all it's either COLLECTING, Interact with other survivors, KILL zombies or hostile survivors.
Good points in the game: Every survivor has their own traits but the personality or voices are the same.
Bad points in the game: bugs, repeating stuff over and over, a lot of building but most of it is not needed.

7 points on xbox. On steam it seems a lot more buggy which makes me give it 5 out of 10",1688644612,1688644612,False,0,2,0.436507940292358398,0,True,False,False

""Kotaku interviewed 12 current and former employees for this article, all of whom requested anonymity because they feared sharing their concerns publicly would doom their careers in the video game industry. Many felt very positive about certain aspects of the studio. A few said it still has room to improve but has overall been a very good place to work. Most considered the last few years since the acquisition a period of crisis, and are worried management hasn’t learned the right lessons.

At first, some employees were worried the Microsoft acquisition would change the indie studio for the worse. Now they worry the $2 trillion company’s incredibly “hands-off” approach allowed dysfunction to fester, leaving some of the studio’s more vulnerable employees to fend for themselves. As one former developer put it, “We were afraid they would come in and change our culture but our collapse came from within, and we could have used [Microsoft’s] help.”

Blood Plague Ferals are the stuff of nightmares! The devs are constantly updating this game and I may come back down the road. They took State of Decay 1 and really improved on things. If the base game isn't enough, there is a decent modding scene for the game as well which adds some longevity to it before you get bored. I sunk 138 hours into it so I'd say you could get your moneys worth. There's some good stories to follow, one of them returns you to Trumbull Valley from the first game. Combat is pretty entertaining when you get your people fully trained up. You'll feel like a zombie terminator, but be careful because there are new zombies in the form of blood plague, which can infect and turn your survivors. Always have an escape plan and know when to bail and live to fight another day. There are several maps to play on which is a big improvement from the old game's single map. Each map has multiple bases that you can occupy, some are better then others. Each map has unique buildings that enhance your community in a certain way, that can be occupied as an outpost. Speaking of which. Outposts are back and recently, the devs added back the ability for outposts to take out hoards in their influence area. One cool feature is cars can be repaired and upgraded into apocalypse versions with armor.

The maps are good and fun to explore, each map containing different types of bases and outposts you can get. The game is pretty solid, but theres a few things to keep in mind:

- Zombies: There are quite a lot of zombies in the game, and they are good. The more noise you make, the more zombies you will bring to your base. However, the zombies will hardly focus any other enemies than you. Sometimes you will encounter hostile NPCs in game (usually a group of 3) and most of the times the zombies won't even do anything to them, even if they are making way more noise than you in that moment.

- Multiplayer: One of the main issues i have with this game is how the multiplayer works in it. It is very ""limited"". Unfortunately if you don't have solo progress, and you are joining a friend's base, you will be limited to do things in the multiplayer. For an example, if your base doesn't have an infirmary, that means your characters will basically never heal, even if the person you are playing with has an infirmary in their base (doesn't matter if its upgraded or not either). Map exploration is also limited.

- The combat: Combat in this game is pretty fun, there are a lot of different weapons in it (for both melee and ranged weapons). However, keep in mind that you can't cancel combat actions, and most of them always play an animation, leaving you to get hit by the other zombies around you and there's nothing to do about it.

- Quests: There aren't a lot of ""side quests"" in this game so most of them end up getting repetitive after just a few hours of gameplay, so don't expect a lot of different events and things to do in them all the time. It's a similar thing for the main quests, but they will change depending on which leader character type you have in your base.

- Skills: There are 4 main skills (they are always the same) however there are a lot of different ""extra"" skills you can get. Some of those skills are mostly useless, and some are pretty good. You can learn those skills by reading the books you may find while exploring, or sometimes survivors will already have one of those skills.

Overall, its a good game and i love it, if you don't mind the few issues it has, it is quite enjoyable.",1687910619,1687910709,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Once upon a time, amidst the desolate landscape of Trumbull County, there existed a world unseen by the living, where the undead roamed in search of sustenance. From the perspective of a lowly zombie, this tale weaves a story of hunger, decay, and unrelenting survival.

In the relentless pursuit of their insatiable appetites, the zombies stumbled through the ravaged remnants of what was once a thriving human society. The world, a playground of decay and ruin, served as a somber backdrop to their existence. With vacant eyes and an unquenchable hunger gnawing at their decaying flesh, these creatures forged ahead, their collective moans creating a haunting symphony.

As night fell, the world of State of Decay 2 transformed into an eerie abyss, where shadows danced and the undead found solace in their ceaseless existence. The moon cast a pale glow upon the desolation, guiding the way for these lost souls. It was in the darkness that their primal instincts took hold, driving them towards the flickering lights that signified the presence of the living.

Amidst the relentless pursuit of survivors, the zombies faced numerous obstacles. Barricades, traps, and fortifications erected by the living posed challenges to their insidious advances. It was a game of cat and mouse, where the undead sought to breach the defenses of the living, craving the taste of warm, pulsating flesh.

But not all zombies were created equal. Some, cursed with decayed limbs or plagued by slower reflexes, found themselves at a disadvantage in this bleak world. They lingered on the fringes, mere spectators to the dance of survival. It was a hierarchy of sorts, where the strongest and fastest reigned supreme, their relentless pursuit posing a constant threat to the fragile existence of the living.

Occasionally, amidst the chaos, the zombies would face unexpected opposition. Survivor groups, armed to the teeth and fortified in enclaves, fought tooth and nail to preserve their humanity. These encounters were brutal, a clash between the unfeeling undead and the desperate resilience of the living. The clash of steel and the deafening roars of gunfire punctuated the air, creating a symphony of violence.

Despite their undying hunger, the zombies of State of Decay 2 were trapped in a perpetual cycle of futility. They sought the sustenance that could never truly satisfy them, condemned to roam an unforgiving world that mirrored their own existence. Their existence, devoid of purpose or redemption, served as a reminder of the horrors that befell humanity.

And so, as the sun rose once more, painting the sky with hues of orange and pink, the zombies retreated into the shadows, waiting for the night to fall once more. In their twisted existence, they remained a constant threat, a chilling reminder that even in a state of decay, there was a dark beauty to be found in the twisted landscapes of Trumbull County.",1674822999,1687832655,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Hoped that State of Decay 2 would improve in that sense. Well... let me put it this way, I spent 53 minutes with the game whereas the net playtime was around 35-40 minutes.

During this time I:

- Had to spend like 5 minutes resetting my Xbox Live account, setting up my appearance over Live and whatever. No Xbox Live, you won't play that game, in 2021.
- Encountered a handful of bugs and glitches, e.g. zombies stucking in ladders and whatever. None of those were deal breaker, but for the love of god, it's been two and half years after release. Yet another reason to not buy games at full price anymore.
- Started the campaign, but realized that the night time is exactly double (60 minutes) of the day time (30 minutes). Now, night time is fucking dark, not impossible to navigate, but for me it's pretty annoying. I don't know whether it tries to promote stealth (which feels like a drag to me, gameplay wise), or increase tension (not working, it increases frustration), but I find it fucking annoying. There is no chance to sleep or fast forward time, so I'm going to refund.

**Good
- Nice, Large Maps that are fun to explore, and scavenge,
- Both ranged and melee combat feels good,
- Mostly very good performance (some weird texture flicker happens sometimes)
- Game has a soft stamina system so you have a reason to cycle characters,
- Driving feels good and has a nice selection of cars,


**Bad
- Story isn't exactly great,
- All non story missions have hidden timers - its often impossible to get all done, before other expire,
- Non story missions can get very spammy every time you load the game, they can get really annoying if you just want to go and do something on your own,
- Can only have bases in fixed locations and bases have fixed buildings and slots available. You can decide what to build in slots but you cannot expand or fortify bases more,
- Outpost feel stupid - you claim them and they magically produce resources, you don't even have to assign any workforce
- The fact that you have unlocked doors around your base which zeds can just open is a tad silly...

I hear so many reviewers rave about how good of a zombie game this is yet I can not for the life of me have fun with it. The game loop goes as follows:  Find a base > Find some supplies > Craft explosives > Find plague heart > clear map of plague hearts > move on to a new map scenario. Once you've finished your first map, you're allowed to ""legacy"" a character which I still have no idea what it does. That game mechanic is not really explained in game. You then take your community you built into a new map, and do the same thing over again. There are also timed missions in the game. Some have an invisible timer on them. You should never pressure your players into a feeling of racing against the clock. I thought we learned this back with Dead Rising. Your AI team mates never understand what you're trying to do. I remember once I was trying to place C4 on a plague heart before it started spewing out zombies and my AI team mate looks over, and starts shooting it, activating the horde.

I have a bit of a love/hate relationship with this game. I really loved the first one, and I was hoping for a proper sequel, but the main game of State of Decay 2 is just an empty sandbox with 1 mission. It was such a sudden shock when I realized that the game was over after doing the first main mission, I couldnt believe that was it, it feels like they rushed it out the door and forgot to make a story for the game. This however was remedied in their Heartland expansion, which did give it a nice little short story, but I feel like that should have been what the main game was. I cannot recommend this game due to it being so short, but I do suggest picking it up on sale and playing it, its worth that at least. The game is also filled with a ton of bugs still, such as exploding cars when trying to repair them, and cars just totally disappearing from where I parked them in my base.

As the follow-up to the original State of Decay, this highly anticipated sequel promises an even more immersive and expansive experience. With a focus on community-building, resource management, and strategic survival, State of Decay 2 offers a unique take on the zombie survival genre.

One of the standout features of State of Decay 2 is its emphasis on community dynamics. Players are not just responsible for their own survival but also for managing and protecting a group of survivors. Each survivor has their own set of skills, strengths, and weaknesses, making the process of building and maintaining a diverse community both challenging and engaging. This aspect adds a layer of depth to the gameplay, as players must make tough decisions to ensure the survival of their community members.

The game world in State of Decay 2 is vast and varied, offering different locations to explore, each with its own resources and challenges. From small towns to military bases, the environments are well-crafted and help create a sense of realism. Scavenging for supplies, fortifying bases, and venturing out into the dangerous world to complete missions all contribute to the immersive experience.

State of Decay 2 features a comprehensive resource management system. Food, medicine, fuel, and ammunition are all vital for the survival of your community, and it's your responsibility to gather and distribute these resources wisely. This adds a constant sense of urgency and keeps players engaged in the struggle for survival. However, the resource management mechanics can sometimes feel a bit overwhelming, and the game could benefit from improved user interface and more intuitive controls in this regard.

The combat mechanics in State of Decay 2 are satisfying and realistic. Engaging in melee combat or utilizing firearms against hordes of zombies can be intense and thrilling. However, the combat system could benefit from a bit more depth and variety, as it can feel repetitive during extended play sessions. Additionally, the enemy AI could be more challenging and varied to keep players on their toes.

Graphically, State of Decay 2 delivers a mixed experience. While the environments and character models are well-designed, some technical issues, such as occasional frame rate drops and texture pop-ins, can detract from the overall visual quality. However, these minor graphical flaws do not significantly impact the gameplay experience.

One of the major highlights of State of Decay 2 is its cooperative multiplayer mode. Playing with friends and working together to survive and thrive in the post-apocalyptic world greatly enhances the overall experience. The multiplayer mode allows for shared resources, strategic planning, and cooperative combat, adding an extra layer of excitement and camaraderie.

In conclusion, State of Decay 2 offers a compelling and immersive survival experience with its emphasis on community-building and resource management. While the game has its share of technical issues and could benefit from some gameplay refinements, it provides an engaging and challenging journey in a post-apocalyptic world. Whether playing solo or with friends, fans of the genre will find a lot to enjoy in this zombie-infested adventure.",1584301893,1686751363,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

State of Decay 2 on the right difficulty will leave you with dramatic scrambles to deal with hordes of zombies or special zombies if you manage things poorly or do not bring the needed supplies to deal with it and absolute success with reasonable planning and patience. It's a really solid zombie open world shooter if you're into that thing.

The biggest standout feature is the community system, which is new as well as having multiple maps to play on. The character generation is fairly big with different survivors having different sets of skills that they can bring to your base, meaning that they aren't divorced completely from your base like they kinda were in the first SOD. Each base has it's ups and downs, even if it seems like a straight upgrade. Some bigger bases are just frankly utterly terrible for dispatching hordes and juggernauts, they'll flood in and everything turns into a bloodbath. The key is picking the one that has many good spots for survivors to dispatch zombies while having key faculties that help manage your community. The upgrades aren't as essential as they seem, some quests and outposts you can setup in the openworld provide for the spaces in your base development you cannot fill. It's just way way way way better than the original State of Decay, which was a very annoying system to deal with. 

Another big part is the dynamic nature of the game as a sandbox. Survivors are generated randomly, whole other communities are randomly generated too. The game invites you to make your own player driven stories through those interactions often finally peaking with a designated leader and their ultimate goal for the community. This is essentially your endgame. It's a great way of pacing the game out a little and you get bonuses for completing a ""community"" every time you do this. Then you can take survivors from your current playthrough and save them for future playthroughs, so if you like that mechanic guy who you saved from a juggernaut and he learnt to build all your badass cars for you and you want him to come along for another ride? You can totally do that. It's pretty flexible and adds a level of meta progression that grows stronger with you being invested emotionally and gameplay wise. It's generally a pretty fun system.

The problems with this system is repetition, you will start to see the same sort of events happen over and over around your third playthrough. The community's overall goal and that questline of sorts rarely changes. It always sorta rolls out the same way which doesn't hurt too bad because most of the time your community progression is built towards making the area you are in safer from plague hearts (essentially red zombie disease) first and foremost. Be it through allying yourself with other communities and trading for supplies or them directly assisting with dispatching them. 

The moment to moment gameplay isn't spectacular, especially as other third person shooters go but it's serviceable. There are a looooot of guns. A lot of weapons. There is a lot of loot to collect and find. If you like grabbing everything in a building that isn't nailed down, this might be your game. Zombies are fairly intense to fight as well, they aren't pushovers especially on your own. If you're on a weak character and the difficulty is high, watch your ass because it won't take much to kill you. If a feral shows up and you're low on health? Your character is dead. The game appreciates stealth chiefly of all but it has the drawback of being a slow way to play the game and frankly kinda boring even if it's a really strong way to play. Go in guns blazing, slashing everything. It's a zombie game after alll! 

A short piece of coop, it's a really flawed unfun system that i am surprised is this halfbaked. It's not good. I hope to see maybe coop communities (maybe set it up similar to stardew valley?) in a third game out of Undead Labs because the sheer amount that you are locked out of doing as a coop partner is aloooooot. It's really not great. Don't get this as a coop game.

I think there is a lot here in State of Decay 2 to enjoy, not for as long as other games but it's an immensely fun journey if you're the right person for it. The foundation here is a lot stronger than SOD1 and i can see this evolving into something really awesome if they nailed out the game's design issues. Think 7 Days to Die but you're managing a whole group of survivors, your friends included. That would be insanely awesome. Undead Labs has put a lot of effort into the post-release content and understanding what people want from this game. I can't recommend this game if you're obviously lukewarm on the genre or open world games in general but if you are then you're gonna have fun for at least 10-30 hours. That's a good sell for a game pass game.",1686055753,1686055808,True,41,0,0.776933550834655762,0,True,False,False

That's why it's so goddamn disappointing to have to leave a negative review. I love this game but it's buggy as fuck. Zombies spawn routinely on top of buildings AND IN THE GROUND so if you don't have special means to kill them you WILL fail the objective and this can kill enclaves. The AI can bug out as well and you'll find your allies standing like idiots being eaten alive. This will easily kill them in lethal difficulty in seconds. I'm so terribly upset to have to give this a negative review when I was enjoying it so much in the first day but the bugs are really bad to have in an ironman game. 

BTW if you want to have a means to kill the bugged zombies get the builder leader's sniper tower. Use it to kill the zombies under the ground. It's idiotic that you need a specific building from a specific leader to kill a bugged out enemy or you auto fail.

EDIT : Oh my god the daybreak mode is absolute garbage. At best it lags like unholy hell unless you are host. 1/4 of the time you will be playing with someone cheating and it's boring as fuck. They forced multiplayer into the game and are too incompetent to make it even passable. ABSOLUTELY PATHETIC.

6/5/2023

Decided to revisit the game for the newest update. Crash to desktop consistently when trying to start a new community. Validation finds nothing wrong with the game. I'm gonna avoid games by this dev in the future, I'm very disappointed this is what their ""polish"" has resulted in.

I'll never get a refund due to my playtime but this game is now dead weight in my library until the devs ""bless"" me with an update that fixes the consistent CTDs.",1625517753,1685991122,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

[i]State of Decay 2[/i] is the sequel to the zombie action/RPG/Community manager title, sporting tighter controls, more maps, and additional activities.

I initially bounced off of it the first time through (and I was an AVID SoD1 fan), but 33 updates later, this one finally hews closer to what made the original fun, in my eyes.

[b][u]""Hey…I'm young, quick, and I got a big ass wrench! What could go wrong?""[/u][/b]
+[i]More Maps+O.G. Trumbull[/i]
4 new towns + Trumbull Valley w/a facelift are available for you to pillage. Each different from the last, and with the inclusion of Forever Communities, are able to continue to game with your favorites for as long as the enjoyment of that lasts.

+[i]Co-Op[/i]
Definitely has it's limitations, and is not a friend taking over a member of your community, nor is it their community neighboring yours on the same map. It's more like a member of their choosing from their community guest starring in an episode of yours. There is a tether, but I did not find it as constricting as the concept would imply - I simply don't feel the need of inviting someone into my world and being on the other side of the map from them.

+[i]More Combat Options[/i]
Tons more than the first, with different takedowns and fatalities, as well as weapons (both melee and firearms). Different character traits yield different combat options, and even further tweaked with choosing specializations.

+[i]Human Enemies[/i]
I was a little shocked when a neighboring enclave heel-turned on me. Then I was delighted. If not properly disposed, be prepared to deal with their undead remains.

+[i]Defining a Leader[/i]
Being able to define a leader within the community further helps you to decide how you will play. Clearing the game with different leaders on different setting nets you ""Boons"" - basically community modifiers that you can use on restarts to further enhance gameplay. Each leader has a path with quests and an ending (so freaking lame - no spoiler but keep expectations super low-to-no). 

+[i]Soundtrack[/i]
Beautiful soundtrack. The music compliments the scenery well, be it quiet gentle lilting tones as you serenely scavenge, or more tempered beats as the action around you reaches a crescendo. A true standout in overall direction of this title.

+[i]33 Updates Later[/i]
I was surprised to see that this game has been updated as often as it has. Meaningful, game-changing/enhancing updates, too! As well as bounties and cosmetics. Far more support than the first title, and having bounced off it initially, totally a better product for it.

[b][u]SoD OFF[/u][/b]
-[i]Lack of Character Creation[/i]
Nothing. Nada. Zip. Zilch. The big goose egg. Thank Heilos for the community manager, so you can get to sorta create your own. But even then, it's cumbersome.

My main community is with characters customized from [i]Evil Dead[/i], and it is freakin' groovy.

-[i]Lack of Meaningful Building[/i]
I loathe the base-building in this one. Something about it just does not look as good as they did in the first. Also, can't barricade windows? I found the base-building in this title to be more restricted than the first, and that's at odds of the momentum of sequels.

-[i]Far TOO Far FOV without DutchGuyMike's Combat FOV Mod[/i]
It looks like [i]Dragon's Age[/i], but it isn't. It is the worst thing ever. The zoom is real. Thankfully, there is a mod that more than amends this - check out DutchGuyMike's Combat FOV mod on SoD2 Nexus.

-[i]Static/Eyerolling Freak Spawns[/i]
The winding road on Providence? Set your watch to a feral being there. Sometimes, 2 juggernauts ""because difficulty"". When it's not natural to the world, and seems like it's triggered per a spreadsheet, it really makes it hard to feel organic. Somehow, SoD1 did it better. They REALLY need something like L4D's A.I. director.

-[i]Ambient Goals Frequency[/i]
It's great there's a lot to do! But it pops so frequently, as soon as you log in, that it is a bit maddening. It's one thing to say ""Well, it's the apocalypse""! But it feels more relative to the issue mentioned above. At least an option to lessen the frequency would be nice, especially on enclaves you recently assisted.

-[i]Community Animation Bug -STILL-[/i]
There is a bug that has been around that does not trigger the standard animations for your community (tinkering at stations, checking crops, etc). Instead, everyone wiggles their legs in-place like they all have to go poop right now. It's distracting, to say the least, and makes you not really want to hang around home when you realize that it does not stop. Ever.

-[i]Highlighted Containers[/i]
I do not like that there is not an option available to disable containers being highlighted. When it's dark, it looks so goofy to see glossy white flashes on objects.

-[i]Low Hope for[/i] State of Decay 3
I just don't have hope for SoD3. In addition to seeing some incongruent design philosophies here, the trailer presentation and the setting being in winter made me think of [i]Wasteland 3[/i]. And [i]Wasteland 3[/i] was terrible. Also, no further news has been given, so it's either super awesome! Or super NAWsome.

I hope it means seasons, as you do notice the lack of any weather in this title. But I am not confident this team is learned/disciplined enough to make that.

Also, the inclusion of animals this late into the series is narratively spurious. I initially got a very moral finger-wagging by the art director on the UL forum for even hinting at having zombie children in the first game (though there are playgrounds and swingsets in backyards), but zombie deers are different.🙄

[b][u]TL;DuuuuRRRRRRR:[/u][/b]
I find [i]State of Decay 2[/i] more enjoyable now than when it first released (now more enjoyable than even SoD1) and if you're just looking for long-term monster mashing, this is a pretty safe bet, albeit the caveats mentioned above.

With SoD3 still off in the future, and with what fleeting news we've seen - [i]State of Decay 2[/i] may be the best arcade-y community manager we'll get. And that's just fine, cos it's really good!",1685892988,1685893987,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Zombies are more an annoyance than a challenge or fun. And affects the pace of the game too much in a negative way.
- Stop with the radio please.
- Quest system is poor. And it is a shame that side quests needs to pop up again every time you restart the game. Also, sometimes you lose a quest by changing characters and this is just not a good system.
- Combat against humans are bad, just bad. This game would be hugely better if exchanging gun fights were better.
- It is a sandbox, I know, but the way you interact with stories should be overhauled in the next SOD.

[code]These are problems that has been brought by the previous SOC game and I hope they address all this to the next SOD because this franchise has a huge potential.[/code]

[h1]Leaving the rant behind, let’s point out the good stuff:[/h1]

+ SOC2 is unique. It is a mix of sandbox survival and community management in a certain casual triple A experience with in depth systems and mechanics that makes this game something else. Definitely my favourite “Xbox exclusive” so far.
+ The constant updates and upgrades are a common thing nowadays, even so  it’s impressive how the devs are still adding stuff, upgrading and rebalancing the game.
+ The DLC Homecoming is an upgrade for those looking for a more story driven experience - without losing the sandbox uniqueness of the game. 
+ Replayability.

Conclusion:

The sandbox experience as a main focus is the main selling point for me. No drama and cinematographic bu11sh1t. No save the world bu11sh1t. There is no hero and death is permanent. 

Community managing is something I would like to see in other open world experiences as well. 

[code]Enough of construction simulator on survival games, please, lol. Just follow what SOC2 does, please - and improve upon that, of course.[/code] 

If you have never played give it a try - or have played before but a long time ago, give it another try. The game has its problems but it is a delicious casual experience without losing deepness for those who enjoy a bit more.

The Devs kept updating the game and still will, so for old players its a coat of fresh paint

I had lots to do playing every map with every leader and doing the achievements

The idea is something i always loved but the implementation is simplistic this is why i can see the game as being repetitive and boring for some.The ideea: you go loot, upgrade the base, you can change bases, there are multiple on every map to accommodate more of your survivors, try to keep people fed happy alive, level their skills, etc.

An example as to why i could see people finding the game boring: the bases are prebuilt, the building zones are pre placed, the looting might feel repetitive due to the way it kinda is and nothing changes,zombies keep spawning in the area around the player even if you kill idk 10 of them etc the coop is weird but a mod fixes that.

These didnt bother me since i loved this kind of idea for a game, and had lots of things to do so i had fun. i recommend trying it at least.",1660766720,1685565596,True,0,0,0.491591185331344604,0,True,False,False

Despite it's flaws and bugs, the game is a pretty good zombie survival game that emphasizes on survival, base building and community building, whether solo or in co-op, you can navigate through 5 different maps and 5 different difficulties with an option to customize.  It's definitely a labor of love for the developers as they still keep on improving upon the game adding new aspects to the gameplay that keeps the game fresh.  

Now there will be a lot of people crapping on the co-op aspect of the game.  Is it perfect?  No it's not, but it's definitely playable between friends and quite enjoyable.  The co-cop is limited to having a host game and friends/other players joining the host game to help out with his map.  The reason for this is mostly because the devs want the game to be playable still in multiplayer in the future without the need of servers.  There is a tether system in place so that visiting players cannot wander too far from the host since the host is hosting the game on his PC, this is in place so that it won't strain the system rendering the open world map.  Hopefully this review helps with people who are interested in the multiplayer aspect of the game.",1644627125,1685425896,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Unfortunately, the job carried him to an active plague heart, and a simple bodyguard mission turned into a hellscape of freaks and plague zombies. The client died, and Goat ran out of medicine and bullets, blew up his car while trying to escape, and fled down the street on foot with only a sliver of health and stamina, a horde of zombies on his heels.

By sheer luck, he found another vehicle abandoned in a residential driveway. The zombies were so close that they swarmed the vehicle as soon as he got in. A screamer on the nearby road shattered all the glass as he pulled away, and the rest smashed the hood and ripped off all the doors. He barely managed to shake them off and GTFO before they wrecked his new ride.

Goat made it home, nearly dead, unable to walk upright, and less than five minutes remaining on his plague infection timer. The crew had exactly one cure in storage, so he survived.

I love this game.

CON:

- Sometimes janky as hell.

- I've had multiple missions break, one of which made the main story impossible to finish even after multiple restarts.

- The game always spawns zombies behind you in combat, even if you've meticulously cleared the surrounding area.

- On Dread difficulty and higher, the zombie spawns are excessive—e.g. dozens of zombies at a time continuously spawning, even after I've already killed dozens or hundreds. There's no break. There are times when I literally can't speak with relevant mission NPCs, because the zombie spawns won't stop and let combat end. I usually have to quit the game and redo the mission when this happens.

- Partial mission progress is not saved, a design flaw which truly rears its ugly head when jank breaks the game. Missions also seem to be kind of random, so any mission you have to quit might never come up again. This hasn't happened to me a lot, but it has happened more than once.

- Vehicle physics are awful, like constantly skidding on ice. I got used to it, but man....

- Hit detection in melee can be iffy. Certain swings at certain times will just ghost through zombies.

- Human enemies can be too resilient. I ran out of ammo putting a guy down seven or eight times. He kept getting up, even when I mag-dumped his skull while he was in the ""help me"" state.

- Low number of character models and voices, so you're bound to wind up with repeats and sometimes outright clones.

- Multiplayer can be fun, but the guest player is just a hired gun for the host. You can't have your community and your friend's community operating on the same map, nor can you actually join someone else's community.

- Higher difficulty settings work in part by making resources very rare, by making vehicles very fragile, and by making base management very expensive. With corresponding increases in zombie strength and combat difficulty, Dread mode and beyond started to feel less satisfying to me. You get less for doing more.

You can set difficulty for Combat, Community (base building) and Map separately. However, turning any slider down will reduce your achievement awards to that level, which is obnoxious. I don't mind massive hordes of infected freaks who all hit like Thanos, but I don't want my armored van to blow up because I backed into a wooden fence.

On the other hand....

PRO:

+ For reasons mentioned previously, the game is wildly addictive.

+ Combat is fun, with good weapon variety. Gunplay is simplistic (crosshair only, no ADS), but has nice oomph. Melee is brutal and well-animated. Flanked zombies can be grabbed/assassinated.

+ Stuff to kill—you've got regular zombies, plague zombies, several types of freaks (screamer, feral, bloater, juggernaut), plague versions of the freaks, and also living humans with clubs, blades and firearms.

+ Radio system for calling in vehicles, medical advice, artillery strikes and other services based on your outposts and relationships with other factions.

+ Nice clean interface.

+ Legacy pool that lets you move characters between communities.

+ Permadeath. Given that some deaths result from glitches and bugs, this isn't always a good thing, but I'd rather have it than not.

+ Several maps, each a few kilometers square and representing a rural town. There's high replay value.

+ With exception to explosive fender benders and oppressive resource scarcity, higher difficulty settings make the game pretty challenging.

+ I haven't completed the Heartland story mode yet, but the organic ""stories"" than arise in the main campaign are enough to get me invested in my characters. It reminds me of Kenshi, which is also janky, and one of my favorite games of all time.

There are some issues and limitations of what you can do in the open world, but all in all the game excels in areas where many others fail. The replayability, sound design and combat is perfectly balanced, even though some of the quests can get a bit repetitive.

Here are just a few of the things I like:

* Online co-op: to play with a friend is awesome, and they can jump in whenever you need a helping hand.
* The continued support by the developer: Even after so many years the updates keep coming with new and improved content. 
* Reasonable launch price: with a 30 dollar price tag you cant complain for what you get.
* Character deaths matter: after investing in a favorite character and upgrading them it really stings when they die. This just makes it more fun since all your actions matter.

yes there are some annoyances like the sometimes dorky AI followers but their behavior is very predictable so it can be overcome by simply adjusting to their behavior. for example, it happens a lot that when i enter into a building to clear it of zombies, the AI follower will run right through me to attack a zombie which is inside the building. after that happening for a bunch of times, i just let it happen or simply avoid taking a follower with me. but they can be great ""gear mules"" so i tend to take one of them with me.

overall though, i think this game deserves my money. there is a clear attention to detail and the game perform well although i get the dreaded Unreal Engine stutters. but other than that, it runs great.

my gripes; VERY few inventory slots on characters and vehicles. i had to get a mod for increased vehicle storage because there are too few slots even on the huge trucks. yes there are skills for improving the character slot count but that can only be had with certain types of skills. i dislike that.

i like the fact that this game allow a friend to join you in your offline campaign. there is plenty of fun to be had that way.

overall, this game has some very satisfying aspects which gets me to come back and play again. yes i have my gripes but those are mostly subjective things.

the good:
- MANY weapons available. it is a huge list. anything from .22 to .50 caliber. all sorts of variations and even classic weapons like WW2 types and repeater rifles. i think it is very likely that anyone will find a weapon they like a lot.
- the selection of vehicles. although the driving is a bit wonky, even with controller. the performance also seems a bit off in comparison to the RPM. some cars are very dramatic in terms of sound although they are still very slow.
- the multiple ways of killing a zombie. it can be done quietly or 100% gore mode. i like that.
- the UI works very well and right clicking to exit is very useful.
- weapon sounds. there is a clear difference between the guns and the sounds make sense to me.
- graphics are decent. at ultra i must say. anything lower than that will quickly turn it into something bleak.

the bad;
- weapons wear too fast for my taste.
- character inventory too small.
- character needs rest too quickly.
- friendlies are crying for help too often and they will go away too quickly when they are ignored ( even when there is good reason for it )
- community AI characters will constantly bump into each other in some bases where the space is less. accompanied by a very annoying UGH sound.
- the amount of AI voices is limited, so it will absolutely happen that a character with completely different looks will have the same voice. i understand that hiring more voice actors is costly and complex though.
- a lot of game mechanics are never explained so it is easy to miss out on some functionality until it is discovered by accident. a proper tutorial ( at user request ) would be nice.
- NEVER take a nice car to the last legacy mission. you WILL lose it. i found that out the hard way damn it!
- too much repetitive character dialogue that gets old too quickly.
- there is probably lots more to complain about but i will leave it for now.",1684930063,1684940245,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-The base building is very rigid and doesnt allow you much imagination

The concept of finding ressource trought a world ravaged by the apocalypse is pretty fun, I recommend the game. Since there's a lot too do. Obviously it is kind of repetitive since well your pretty much always looting, fighting or destroying plague's heart. In the end the game is worth it with the daybreak mod which allow you too buy some member of the red talon team for your community. The worst thing about the game in my opinion is definietly multiplayer. If you join someone else, you basically risk your character's life for nearly no reward... as the host get most of the best (which is kind of normal but instead could just make it so both player get reward. The players that are not the host cannot walk too far away from the host... which is kind of stupid since it makes it annoying when your trying too loot a place or even run away from a horde (or any other type of threat). Basically , the multiplayer mode is kinda nice but could be WAY better in any term of optimization such as making it possible too have equal loot and not being limited in where you are going on the map. It could also be nice too add the option too let a player go trough my base's storage as when someone joins you they need too use their own ressource... adding on the fact they don't get as much ressource as they would in their own game.. so unless you just wanna play for fun (or help your friend if you already play the game or anything) then multiplayer is really not worth... so yeah. the game is really good, great concept, good looking graphic, run pretty well on my pc (it doesnt struggle much which is good), and as a lot of content which is nice. so yeah I recommend the game but avoid buying it if it's only too play with your friend (that said, it is my opinion so maybe you would love it even if it'S only to play with your friends).",1684798254,1684798254,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

It certainly feels a bit 'last-gen' in terms of its scope, and its co-op play is play fun but is also a bit limited as you only 'help' the host player and don't actually get to properly interact with the story or base locations of a game that you join.
The melee combat is slick, but I've lost count of the number of times I've pressed 'E' to perform a take-down of a zombie, only to open or close a door instead, or start a chat with an NPC.
Gun-play is also really good, although the guns don't feel hugely different from one-another with a .22 calibre pistol just as likely to pop the head off of a zombie as a .50 cal.
The game does start to get repetitive faster than I would like, even when playing as different leader types, there is not a huge variation in the game. Base building is a pre-fab arrangement with only minor variations each base location.

Sometimes you lose your main character because you made some stupid mistake or the AI made a stupid decision, sometimes you get plague and think, ""yea I can loot one more house and head back."".... no... u can not. On harder difficulties, it's literally a nightmare, I played my fair share of games, but I have to admit that SoD2 on lethal is one of the hardest playthroughs I've ever done.

Gameplay is very good, long lasting, addictive, and repetitive without falling into stereotypes.
Graphics are fine, and I cannot say many bad things (a few bugs here and there)

AI (as mentioned above) is one thing that has made me rage quit it a few times in the past (I hardy ever RQ) as characters dying cuz stupid mistake or decision, progress lost, items lost, but most importantly, memeber of the community is gone (best if your most skilled person dies). However, it didn't happen very often, so it was bearable. And ofc it's not the end, but a stepback (a long one tho)

Overall, I would give SoD2 8,5/10 as I like challenges (plenty here) and zombie games, and this is definitely one of my favorites next to 7DTD, Zomboid, and Dying Light.
One thing that's shame is that there is no ""normal"" co-op here, only helping someone else in their save and progress. Otherwise, it is definitely worth those few bucks. Grab the Juggernaut edition while you are at it, and you are good to go. Show us all how you survive (often for a few weeks) in this blood soaked zombie world. oh and I forgot to mention, blood plague ---> run home. Trust me, I was there.. and no, I did not make it to the car, nearest outpost, or a base, and neither will you.

PS: I had a pause with SoD2 for a year but came back for update 33, definitely looking forward to those new mechanics with plague hearts.
PSS: One advice, leave your followers at home, they are more in the way then help + they can die too :) (and they will)

State of Decay 2 is pretty much State of Decay 1 but packaged better with some [now new] features which give the game a few helpful twists.

Zombies as a whole aren't hard to deal with, on higher difficulties they'll swarm you but its still doable, the freak zombie will still wreak you if you're not careful but all in all its very hard to lose someone in this game unless you get careless or very unlucky which has only happened to me about once in the entire time i've played this. 

Its base building mechanics are fine I guess, they're not very inspired even with the most recent updates but to give the undead labs team their due they've worked quite well on implementing the new features such as a key location on each map and the new plague heart features which lock you out of claiming surrounding areas and spawning way more plague zombies.

The issue with this game is its ability to hook you in. Sure it'll do it for the first 3 to 10 hours but after that you've done it all before and its just about trying the new maps out, sadly even those aren't too great but the overall diversity is decent and the limited customisation options are a nice touch too albeit a bit simple.

All in all its not really a base builder, not really an RPG, and not really base management game, its a hybrid of all the aforementioned that handles them well enough but not so good enough that you'll be wanting more once the game stops being fun.

That said the multiplayer bit is a nice touch, enjoyed that but again locking stuff behind it and rewarding those who actively play it is a bit of a poor design choice. Some of us don't want online features to unlock offline aspects, sure carry over is nice but make it so you can get it from the normal offline methods otherwise its having no respect for your players time.

Edit: Undead labs have now implemented a few changes to how plague hearts work and now allow you to get multiplayer rewards via the normal campaign which is a good quality of life review but a little too late in my opinion as the multiplayer stuff should have been around since the start in my opinion rather than locking it behind a ""you got to play with others"" wall.

The games still worth a purchase but only on sale.",1624632846,1684497365,False,4,0,0.529150903224945068,0,True,False,False

We can now actually avoid the formation of infestations by being careful around sleeping plague hearts and infestations are no longer constantly popping up randomly all over the map.

Original (negative) Review:
Infestations. I hate infestations. The next update will make dealing with infestations mandatory. Why? Why do you hate us devs? Why do you think so many players take the morale hit and ignore infestations? Maybe, just maybe because it's bland busywork, possibly the least fun part of the game? And now we will get wiped if we ignore this sisyphean task? Wow. -.-

ZOMBIE SURVIVAL DONE RIGHT.
Great graphics and quality animations, lots to do plenty of maps and areas to loot. I love THE SPECIAL MOVES and take downs added depending on your characters specialized skills; would love more of that!

MY FEED BACK TO DEVS:
1 - Give more love to Daybreak mode, I have everything unlocked for it and have beat it over and over. It would be nice to get an option to stay on the map and fight harder and harder waves until death; or new different maps/areas, along with maybe some characters to unlock or choose from. Its a really fun alternative and there's alto of potential there that can keep players coming back.

2 - After update 33 i see there's now options to give your survivors commands to search for infestations and i know if your moral is high survivors will bring home stuff... but Please EXPAND ON THIS, but do like the old web browser last stand games used to do... Have a dynamic where we can send out our survivors on missions to search for materials/ loot and search for survivors, with a success rate % that increases based on that survivors skill level and what tools we send them off with. (Risk even death) It will add a whole nother mini game within the game and expand the dynamic of managing our community and giving them more purpose as well.

Thanks for listening to the community and always improving the game! I hope these 2 suggestions get some love! it will only make an already great game better! :)",1684253131,1684253131,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

They have already squeezed everything they could out of this game.. If they don't release SOD3 soon, they risk making a fool of themselves.. The last update 33 is actually an increase in the degree of difficulty and that's about it; it can be seen that they have left until of ideas: new weapons, new maps, new characters, etc. There were so many things to do.. shame.. it's the top 3, my favorite games,but I can't play it anymore.. there's nothing new and it's getting boring..",1684251045,1684251045,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

The reason it loses several points is the fact the achievements are still buggy, but at least most of them pop when completed, and the story missions and side missions are severally lacking in the base map of Providence Ridge / the base campaign. However; it is a great zombie game, even in single-player, and is one I would recommend to pick up on-sale due to it being one of the better zombie games out, even 5+ years later.

Achievements do not pop, and apparently this is a bug that has been reported to the developers but a hotfix has still not been issued, it seems. Thus, even though State of Decay 2 is miles ahead of State of Decay 1 in every single way, the achievement system at least worked in the first, and I sadly cannot give this game a positive review as a result.

Namely the infestation mechanic is no longer random and arbitrary but actually something the player control over. Also it's not a total resource sink as you can actually get rare drops out of it.

The rest of the game is serviceable as well. The game loops fold well into each other and combat is acceptable. No one aspect of this game blows you a way. But it keeps your attention well enough and has enough variety in activities to not become boring too quickly. As such it's a solid 7.5 / 10 game.

Pros:

Vast Open-World: State of Decay 2 offers a vast and immersive open-world environment to explore. It features diverse landscapes, including towns, forests, and countryside, providing players with plenty of areas to scavenge for resources and establish their bases.

Survival Mechanics: The game excels in its survival mechanics, requiring players to manage resources, build and fortify their bases, and make tough decisions to ensure the survival of their community. It offers a satisfying and immersive survival experience.

Permadeath and Character Progression: Each character in State of Decay 2 is unique, with their own set of skills and abilities. The game incorporates permadeath, meaning that if a character dies, they are gone for good. This adds a layer of tension and strategy to gameplay, as players must carefully manage and develop their characters to ensure their survival.

Cooperative Multiplayer: State of Decay 2 allows players to team up with friends in cooperative multiplayer, enhancing the experience by enabling collaboration in building bases, completing objectives, and surviving together in the zombie-infested world.

Cons:

Technical Issues: State of Decay 2 has been criticized for its technical issues, including performance hitches, frame rate drops, and occasional bugs. While some of these issues have been addressed through updates, they can still hinder the overall experience.

Lack of Variety in Missions: The game's missions and objectives can feel repetitive over time. There is a lack of diverse and engaging quests, which can make the gameplay experience feel monotonous.

Clunky Controls and Combat: The controls and combat mechanics in State of Decay 2 have been a point of criticism. The combat can feel clunky and unresponsive at times, impacting the fluidity and enjoyment of combat encounters.

Limited Character Development: While each character has unique traits and abilities, the depth of character development and customization is somewhat limited. There is a lack of deep narrative arcs or significant character progression beyond basic skill upgrades.

Overall, State of Decay 2 provides an engaging open-world survival experience with its resource management, base building, and permadeath mechanics. Despite some technical issues and repetitive missions, the game offers an immersive cooperative multiplayer experience and a challenging survival sandbox for players who enjoy the genre.",1683954265,1683954265,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There *is* a story DLC campaign, but it's not really what you'd expect or want from a story mode.

I think they tried a little too hard to maintain the mechanics of the game and didn't do anything to make the story mode its own thing. They should have nixed all base building elements and open-world elements in favor of some diverse mission-based maps or something. I know that sounds strange considering this is a survival community-builder zombie game, but the point of a story mode should be to focus on the characters, the events surrounding them and to give a change of pace. It shouldn't just be a neutered version of the core gameplay. You don't choose what base to build in, you get the one you're given. You don't choose who to recruit (just whether or not to recruit them, which is a bit like choosing not to kill a zombie about to eat your brains or to do what you're expected and shoot it), you recruit the pregenerated NPCs they created. You *do* choose your characters, but only out of two pairs and honestly they should have just let you play all four at once instead.

I can safely say, though, that the core gameplay itself is very fun. In the main game, ignoring the tutorial that you're forced to do at least once (which forces preset tutorial characters on you and doesn't let you choose your map, but is fun to do at least once and gives a good sense of the game's mechanics, plus two unique randomly generated NPCs with rare preset voice-sets), the game is pretty open and lets you build up your own community however you want. You choose who joins and who leads, which conversely changes the overall demeanor of your group (and may cost you members if you ignore them on the more touchy subjects like helping escaped convicts, though these events are rare and are tied to your leadership missions, which you *can* skip if you want, but I think the rewards are worth dumping that whiny survivor over).

It's a true survival game, so you'll spend most of your time scrounging up rucksacks of supplies, managing your ammo, health items, vehicle health and gas supply while trying to improve your base and, with time and enough community growth, replace it for one that looks better and can fit more. There are usually two small bases, two medium ones, two large ones and at least one huge base for you to choose from and if you think you can manage it, you never have to upgrade at all. There are downsides to this, but if you like a certain large base, it's totally viable to stick with it instead of moving into an uglier huge base.

And there's a lot of automation in the game to help you get by, as well. If you don't care for gathering specific supplies like, say, ammo, you're expected to build outposts and they'll help with this. Each supply type has an outpost type that matches it and will give you +1 per day of that resource. Expending 1 ammo a day because of a defense tower? Want to gain more ammo? Go find an ammo store and claim it as an outpost. It makes a safe zone, gives you ammo per day and you can even upgrade it up to two times to get more ammo out of it and access to other perks like training in chemistry (a community skill, all survivors have one slot for it).

To try and sum this up, the game fits a very nice niche. I love building up cities, empires, communities, etc. and games that offer this tend to get my attention. Without these mechanics I don't know if I'd like the game quite as much, though that's not to say I think the combat mechanics are in any way bad, they're just not enough on their own to draw me in. Thankfully it has much more to it that and you'll no doubt enjoy the depth that the game has to offer in community management and combat if any of this has intrigued you.

And if there's anything you don't like, check out the Nexus for mods. Someone has probably already had the same thought and fixed it and mods do not affect your online compatibility at all. You can play with others even with mods enabled, though it doesn't install for them or anything like that, so they probably won't see those weird custom clothes you put in your game.

I should add a small note that the online for this is not that great. I enjoy it, don't get me wrong, but you are essentially a helper in someone else's world when you join them. You can't build things, you can't set up a base or contribute in any meaningful way. The best you can do is drive around with them, carry their rucksacks (as well as donate them to their storage), and give them stuff you've collected to help them progress in their world. You gain influence by doing this, which is the game's trading currency and is used for all sorts of stuff, but it's not a huge gain and you'll probably waste a ton of ammo and health items along the way that almost makes it not worth it. Still, it's fun, so I can't complain. I think we all wished it could have been better, though.

There's also a Daybreak mode which is basically a zombie wave defense multiplayer mode. You and up to three other players protect a technician from increasingly difficult waves of zombies and try to recover in-between waves with drops. The reward for this is new gear unlocks for this mode and the main game, as well as up to 9 special rewards usable in the main game only (base building stuff, basically), all of which is obtainable using prestige (also obtained from playing Daybreak) with the vendor. You can also use prestige you earn here to recruit Red Talon members to your community. They have unique community skills and are quite powerful, but do come with various drawbacks.

The fighting animations are good too. Reminds me of watching the walking dead sometimes.

This is an open world survival camp simulator where you take your survivors out to scavenge or do missions to help people, fight bad guys, kill zombie hordes etc.. It is great.

The camp management has some depth to it too. You need to plan gardens, craft items, setup some towers to help reduce the zombie threat. At times you could be out scavenging and your base is under attack by zombies.

This is probably the best zombie game I have ever played.

The core gameplay loop of State of Decay 2 as a zombie survival sandbox is certainly rewarding. Managing your base and your people, bringing back supplies, and curtailing threats all activate the hunter-gatherer neurons efficaciously. 

I also clocked in a lot of hours just figuring out how things ticked. Even more hours just putzing around and experiencing the world despite it only being three maps for most of the game's initial shelf life. I'm [i[still[/i] surprised on occasion by the odd things you can find by exploring (extremely rare, bizarre guns like the AKM with an obscene curly-fry magazine stuffed into a tube with 150 rounds of ammunition), references to Stephen King's IT, lawnmower shenanigans, etc. 

I will say one thing I really appreciated is that with the Juggernaut edition you get everything rolled into one, and Undead Labs is still updating the game without charging for it, which is very, very rare to see. Great kudos goes to them for that - and despite not having touched SoD2 in a little while, hearing about the newest substantial update 33 inspired me to write this review. 

If you like zombie survival sandboxes that reward exploration, preparation, quick thinking, improvisation, progression, and which have a sardonic but amusing sense of humor peppering what writing there is, you'll like State of Decay 2.

In short, this game is still just a poor port of a console game. I don't know what it's like on console, so I couldn't tell you if it's more playable on it.

There are so many broken things, such as your survivor refusing to use ladders and falling to their death for no reason, or getting launched into the air by a curb. Dumb deaths like those, or having your car go from 100% to zero because it was stuck on invisible objects would be a lot less frustrating if there were console commands or saves, but it's not fixable. If you lose somethings, the game saves the loss. I have liberally used the ""stuck"" option, but I have just as often had to use Ctrl+Alt+Delete to close the program when the stuck button wasn't accessible.

The computer version does have mods and there are tons of unfixed exploits that somewhat make this game playable, but I'm sick of just expecting all of the games I play to be broken and trying to fix them while I play. Leave it to Microsoft to make a game that's hardly playable on Windows.

In addition to the bugs, the game seems overly commercialized. They added overpowered assets to the game that ruin the more appealing storytelling aspects of the game. I can't imagine that the original developers would have liked this, if they're still involved in decisions or if they were somehow overruled. Another odd thing about the storytelling aspects is that the story takes place in the US, but the majority of riffles are chambered in 7.62, with the usual bias. I'm not interested in the debate involving the differences between 5.56 and 7.62, but I really don't get how 7.62 is all of the sudden the most dominant round in the US, and preferred by all of the elite Soldiers. It would have made sense if they just removed the distinction altogether and labeled them ""riffle rounds"".

Posted: Aug 30, 2021 @ 11:27am

""In a sentence: this is the best zombie-survival game I have ever played, with hands-down the best dev team of the genre.

It was day 27 of the zombie apocalypse, and I was taking my favorite character out for scavenging. I'd recently ran out of gas, so I decided, what the heck, I'll just run to the nearest potential gas site... over half a kilometer away. This may not sound that far to you, but in the zombie apocalypse, half a kilometer on foot is like the journey your grandparents traveled to and from school back in their day: uphill both ways, in 5 feet of snow, with only a raw potato for lunch. But I'm no dummy. So before heading out, I grabbed a vial of plague cure, along with a bunch of stimulants, in case I happened to get into trouble...

Flash forward about 45 minutes. My favorite character is sprinting back to base, having contracted blood plague for a SECOND time this trip, after using up the one vial of plague cure I brought along. The timer at the bottom left of the screen is counting down the seconds until my guy drops dead from the plague. Meanwhile, there are three. Count. THREE Ferals (cat-like zombies that run on all fours and hate you and everyone you know) sprinting after me. My dude is downing stimulants like they're fricken Tic Tacs, while hauling butt back to base. He's bobbing and weaving like he's the star of a new Rocky movie, as these ferals hurl past him every couple seconds trying to slice through him like warm butter. But my guy has quads of steel, glutes that could crack open a walnut, and enough stimulants in him to kill a small country, so he just keeps on trucking. I'm on the edge of my seat, actively shouting at the screen, squeezing my controller to death, and implementing any other proven tactics I can think of for increasing the speed of my character.

Finally, I throw the door open to my base as my other community members gather to beat the ever-living heck out of these stupid ferals (it was a joyous moment). The timer has three seconds left on it as I down a vial of plague cure from my supply locker. My guy was safe. The relief I felt was better than having a scheduled phone call be canceled. Pure bliss.

The next day, my favorite character ran into a bloater while driving, contracted blood plague, and was then beaten into the ground by a Juggernaut. Devastation... like going over to a friend's house for a sleepover and realizing you forgot to bring an extra controller.

I will never forget you, favorite character, whose name has escaped me.


Thank you, Undead Labs, for giving me this experience. This is my favorite game of all-time! :)""",1683777078,1683777078,True,1,0,0.501976311206817627,0,True,False,False

I had a hard time at start but slowly got into rhythm. It takes time. If you like zombie survival genre then at its current state, it's a very good game. Unlike other companies; Undead Labs have been constantly updating and adding new features/contents to the game. There are still few bugs here and there but nothing game breaking to sour your experience.

The main story isn't good or memorable. The first game had better story and characters. Outside of Heartland DLC, barely any story exists in main campaign. The multiplayer co-op part is very lacklustre. If you want to enjoy a whole playthrough with your buddy then you'll soon find out that the invited friend has very little to do. Despite all, I'd still recommend this game to players who like this genre and want to try something new. Base building, community management and collecting the many different weapons the game has(it has a lot) are some of the best aspects of the game.",1683717567,1683717567,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are 4 maps to be had here each with their own unique look and, more importantly, layout. Each map has several bases that also have some unique bonuses. After a character has gained enough standing, they can become a leader; a leader can have 4 different archetypes that also lead to different buildings. Once you've eliminated all the plague hearts in a town you enter a kind of ""phase 2"" of the game and begin to complete your leader's goal which can vary depending on the aforementioned archetypes. Other settlers will also have goals and missions that come up as you play where you can learn more about them and earn some unique gear or even other survivors. The game is also even more fun with friends and is just glitchy enough to be hilarious but not game-breaking. It's also HIGHLY replayable because of the random nature of the community and area. It's also recieving consistent updates, with the newest (FREE) content drop coming May 10, 2023.

Cons: The bad things I have to say about this game are far and few between. 1) The control scheme is a little unintuitive on PC, this is definitely a controller game first and foremost. It's not anything too crazy though, just takes a bit to get used to. 2) Difficulty falls off (and becomes a bore) once you get yourself a few guns and explosives and a decent base. Dread and Nightmare are definitely the go-to difficulties after you've learned the mechanics. 3) NPCs talk a little too much and it does feel a little impersonal. Once again a minor issue but in a game focused on building a community it can be an issue for immersion. The people on the radio NEVER shut up, even about things you've done already or rumors you've already heard a thousand times before. Definitely could us an option to shut off the radio or at least mute it.",1683667342,1683667342,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Multiple vehicles with different handling and storage creates uniqueness. Lots of replay-ability with multiple maps and bases to choose from.

Cons: AI is stupid beyond reason. Too often will you have a mission with a follower to clear an area, but the moment you exit a vehicle they start blasting away with whatever firearm they have. This in turn attracts more zombies, which in turn has them fire more. This creates and endless cycle of zombies flowing into your area which is exacerbated by the fact the zombies are consistently spawned instead of just attracting nearby zombies. Wouldn't be so painful if shots just ATTRACTED nearby zombies and didn't cause them to spawn. Some things block character movement which makes no sense (aka stalks of corn, cause you can't push them out of the way I guess}. Controls can be a bit sluggish with multiple actions being bound to the same key (aka space bar is jump/climb over/kick) which can cause your character to preform the wrong action at a crucial moment

Overall if they had a feature to let you to command your followers actions this would be a 9/10, without it I have to give it 7/10. Being a zombie community building game not being able to bring members of your community or others with on quests due to the poor allied AI writing detracts of the game.

Wasn't a fan of these type games but a friend was playing it a lot and I got it on discount in one of the steam sales.

To be honest what a purchase,fun,makes you jump from time to time LMAO (mainly the damn ferals rugby tackling you haha) 

Building a base,community and generally running about looting everywhere.

You will at times probably lose a member of your community it happens to us all but you can recruit others so its not a big problem. My advice to prevent it happening avoid big hoards when your player is weak or tired,always take painkillers or meds with you and always have at least 1 plague cure with you. Make sure you use silencer on rifles or use crossbow as this is cheaper option to craft arrows through materials and bow doesnt make as much noise. 

Avoid the juggs as they can only be killed with rifles generally they can be killed with other things but takes alot longer. Big tip for them is to jump on containers/buses as they cant bash these and makes it easier to shoot them in the head.

Always run over them damn screamers (hitting them with door open is better option and saves vehicle getting damaged) or reverse into them.

Upgrade a van with heavy vehicle upgrade kit,this will help with looting runs.

Plague hearts dont like molotovs or fire bombs,pipe bombs. So throw one at heart then jump on top of your van to deal(shoot) the hoard of zombies and not get jumped by feral(s). You can in some situations stand on van and throw the bombs at plague hearts through windows of houses and saves you trying to run away alot. But be careful as if theres Jugg about he will bash your van and you'll fall off. If there is a jugg around i tend to beep the horn and get him to chase you up road so hes out of way of your plague heart destroying. This is normally a 2,3 or 4 wave thing. You can make it alot easier to destroy hearts using other methods of bombs but cost effective. So i did molotov method alot of the time. 

 I also use standing of van method to deal with infestations,try shoot or bow screamers 1st as they'll attract more zombies,ferals,juggs,bloaters in. Ah,yes the bloaters.....avoid these also shoot them as soon as you see one as they're sneeky and hide behind objects,cars,and other things and can be a bit of a pain.

Heartland is another good story mode and brings another side and story to the game. You'll also build a seperate community there with some advanced stuff on offer ie,better members abilities,base upgrades and other things. Anything gained from this looting wise doesnt end up in your main community locker so once story is done its done. You can do it over again and recruit new people if you like. 

Daybreak is another fun mode where you deal with waves of zombies,bloaters,ferals and juggs while defending a guy in the base. Make sure the walls are always repaired and dont let the guy in base get hurt always top him up with bandages to keep him full health and team up on juggs to get them beaten up quickly. Playing this mode will earn you reward tokens which can buy things that can be used in normal campaign community so the more you play more perks you'll earn and can buff up your base,community. This is probably best played with team of friends as you can assign jobs for each you,1 repairs walls,1 gets cleo drops,plus you can spead out outside to defend base better and stop zombies even reaching the walls and destoying them.

Like i say a very fun game which i didnt think i would be into but thanks to my friend for tips and getting me into this as its worth a buy when its on sale for sure. 

And be careful of angry AI in game as them upset people hit or shoot hard and hurt alot so shoot from beside vehicles or walls and use rifles as my advice as pistols i found didnt do the damage needed to deal with them.

I finally purchased it and after about 4 or 5 days I already have 84 hours into it. Its addictive and has a lot to offer. I am on my second play through because there are 4 maps (I believe) and each choice you make changes your goals for the whole game. For example as your base camp grows you have to choose a leader from your group. Different characters offer different goals. You can be a sheriff trying to help others on the map, or you can be a warlord and build an army, or even a builder who is trying to clear the zombies and rebuild civilization and I believe more. Depending on who you encounter and how you interact with them brings new possibilities. For example I had this girl asking me to help her retrieve an AI trapped in a satellite, so I did. Then we went our own ways, but as I'm playing I would hear her on the radio talking to this AI. Then later in the game she shows up at my home base and asks if she can set up the AI's heaven program on my base. I wont tell you what happens if you allow it but its AWSOME and its only one of many interactions. 
Now while I'm obviously a fan the game  could be better. So I play a lot of game like I am sure you have as well, but this one has a bit of a learning curve. I am still figuring things out. I wish the base building was more actual building. Instead you have to find survivors with the skill to build what you want, for example you need an auto mechanic in order to build an auto shop to fix up or trick out you vehicles. That would be OK except you can only add like 3 to maybe 5 different shops on your base. Depending where you set up your home base there will be some stuff there like a barracks or a kitchen already there. Then you have to choose, from about a dozen shops you can build. Things like a clinic to heal your folks or a garden to grow food or work bench to fix weapons. Now these are all important but like I said you can only have a few so you have to decide what is critical to the way you are trying to play. Basically building is just to limited. 
Play through isn't really long but its definitely replayable because you just want to see what happens if you had done things a little different and being that you can change the map and the people, I'm not sure that you could get the same play through a second time if you tried. 

 Is this game going to amaze you, probably not. Do I recommend, definitely! Just keep in mind its a sand box style game so theres no real story beyond the one you make as you go. They do offer so many missions that you won't be able to do them all and find the time to work on your base, meaning you cant help everyone who asks. Also while this does have a multiplayer option I have played completely single player due to slow internet where I live, so I'm not sure how playing with others may improve the game.",1683181260,1683181260,True,1,0,0.504173755645751953,0,True,False,False

The influence system has thankfully been overhauled since the first game. You never need to worry about coming back to the game after a week to see the game has depleted your resources or a character’s influence down to zero. 

The same can’t be said for the controls. Movement is easily the worst aspect of this game. State of Decay 2 feels like an extremely cheap indie game. Whether on foot or in a car, the controls are often unresponsive, as if it is ignoring your input every fifth button press. And, no, it isn’t my hardware. Simply turning around is frequently impossible because the game seems to have tank controls. You often have to turn your body around 180 degree then hit the forward button to move out of a corner. 

Vehicle handling alternates between feeling too stiff, randomly stalling out in the middle of driving, or cars twirling around in circles like they are on ice whenever you make the slightest turn while backing up.

And that’s why I became a 45 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am the father to my son, Alfred, who is now 14. Recently, my son downloaded this game and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was devastating for me, as instead of bonding over ping pong, he was locked away in his room. As a result, I decided to make a Steam account, and get this game and take an interest in his hobbies, as my father had never done. I loaded into the game, and had no clue what to do, so I asked my son for help, and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it, as he hadn’t seemed this happy since we went rock climbing together in 2018. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again, and now we spend time together on hobbies that I grew up with, such as fishing. This game reminded me that there’s fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both I and my son many happy memories.

I just lost my best character, a maxed out builder named Bree.  I was driving her to a map exit so I could change maps and bases...  The menu to change areas came up, but I could hear zombies in the background attacking her.  I drop out of the menu to see what is going on just as she gets ripped in half by a juggernaut, surrounded by a crowd of zombies.  Yup, the game murdered my best girl without a chance while I was in a menu.  I immediately Ctrl-Alt-Del'd the game hoping to avoid an autosave and save Bree, but when I logged back in all I got was a menu forcing me to switch characters.  Well, that sucks.

This game is janky but fun.  It lacks good AI for your survivors and it lacks some basic quality of life features.  For example, the character you control always HAS to drive, and you HAVE to bring your current ride and follower back to base.  Your AI companions will not drive, and they don't fight particularly well either.  I lost another nearly maxed character a stone's throw from my base despite her being fully kitted with several full slots of meds and great gear.  Frustrating.

If you enjoy driving games you'll like this game better than I do.  I actually hate driving games and don't like driving very much IRL either.  And this game isn't the good kind of driving... it's stressful, with barriers, roadbloacks, zombies, etc.  And the game seems like it's night time more than day time.  I hate night driving.

That being said, it is quite a fun little game for a while.  Replayability is near infinite and you can reuse favoritie survivors for another playthrough as long as the game doesn't cheapshot kill them as has happened to me a few times.  There are many different bases, vehicles, and a lot of weapons to choose from.  It's a bit grindy.",1682888125,1682888125,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There's no real story, but that has the benefit of keeping things open and not annoying the player with constant cut scenes (like Days Gone - a far more story-driven experience). 

Unlike Days Gone, SoD is far more about community building, and SoD2 improves on the first game with a much bigger world split into 4 seperate game maps for greater variety, and with improved graphics. It still fires missions at you faster than you can deal with, but they are optional, so its simply a matter of prioritising. There will be many missions that you end up ignoring just so you can focus on your current task, whereas story missions will wait for as long as you want. The player is able to switch between any of the characters in your community more or less at will until you leave base, you can still switch between yourself and another partner via outposts you have claimed, letting another character take over if your health/stamina is low. Outposts also provide you with access to your community inventory if you need to restock on ammo/meds etc. With proper planning you can do some really long scavenger runs. Choose your kit wisely because the decisions you make regarding what you bring with you will make the difference between mission success and failure, e.g. life or death.

SoD2 brings some new mechanics like the plague hearts, which produce plague zombies that can infect your survivors, meaning they will require treatment within a certain time to stop any bitten community members from turning into zeds.. Those plague hearts need to be destroyed in order to claim nearby outposts, and can drop a decent amount of loot.
Infestations (basically hoards centred around buildings) also keep reccurring. Failing to do so will impact on community morale, though you can never eradicate them completely and tackling them can seem never-ending. The more infestations on the map however, the more you will regularly be called back to base to fight off zed attacks. 

Your community of survivors is ultimately your most important resource, so you gotta look after them. Keeping on top of infestations and destroying plague hearts will help boost their morale. It's also important to be mindful of their skills when letting new members join your community, as certain skills are required for certain types of facility and any upgrades to them. You may find yourself seeking out a mechanic (vital for keeping your vehicles in check via the auto-shop facility) or a survivor with agriculture to max out your farm facility. 

A good new feature is the legacy pool, which basically saves favourite survivors for a later playthrough, though sending them to the legacy pool does mean losing them for the reminder of your current game, so consider only banking survivors with duplicate skills. If a survivor dies in-game however, they are lost forever, whether they are legacy-pooled or not.You will gain attachments to a few favourite survivors, while others will be z-fodder, depending hoe you feel. Exiling some survivors with skills you don't need (or sending them to the legacy pool) is necessary now and again to make available space for survivors with the skills you do need. There are also training manuals dotted around that can be used to train up survivors with existing skills, or a new skill if they have an empty skill slot available.

Characters, other than those you pick at introduction, are relatively random, with a different playthrough beyond the introduction sequences producing different sets of characters. Losing a particularly favourite character with useful skills can be a painful experience, so try not to bite off more than you can chew. You can team one survivor up with another, which is always advisable when leaving base. While the characters can put up a good fight, they will tire and and may become quickly overwhelmed if you run out of luck.

While there's a lot to do, and it can take some time to get established, it's fun whiling away the hours building up a community of survivors, and with four map regions to choose and even switch between when you've grown tired of the same map, it provides many hours of fun.

It's not all perfect though. Don't rely too much on AI to cover your ass. The dev also decided on a really annoying 'one key for everything' system (E on keyboard, Y on xbox controller) which does everything including talk/open or close door/enter vehicle/search lootbox/repair vehicle/refuel/sneak attack....so quite often you're trying to do one thing but end up doing another because of you're in close proximity to another character, object or zed etc....really frustrating if you're close combat against a hoard of zeds, fighting for your life, and instead of sneak-stabbing a zed in the head the moment the opportunity arises, you open interaction with your nearby buddy instead, like ''hey lets have a chat while 20 zeds are trying to eat our throats.''

That issue aside though, I'm having a lot of fun hours on this game because its one of those games where the decisions you make all matter...whether its deciding what kit to take with you each time you venture out of your base, to deciding what facilities your base needs, to deciding on your leader...everything shapes your community in a way that makes every playthrough on every map a different experience each time, and that's what keeps me coming back.",1657328222,1682731713,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Had this game on Xbox a while ago, and finally decided to purchase here on Steam during the recent publisher sale that hit the platform. Coming from the original State of Decay back when it released, I was introduced to the sequel when it came out during it's time as well, and it is still pretty fun to play. In my eyes, both games are. Granted, they have their differences, and the sequel seems a little buggier in some areas, but they're both good Zombie survival horror in all. 

WHAT IT FOCUSES ON

The strong suite of State of Decay is it's focus on creating Apocalypse communities, where you take control of, manage and direct your survivors as you build your community bases from decisions you make throughout the game. While the system of decision making stems deep in this game, I do wish in some areas it were deeper. For instance, being able to actually intervene with survivor conflicts as the leader, and developing personal relationships between different survivors to create different scenarios. 

IN A NUTSHELL

All in all, this is a solid title. It boasts a huge weapon arsenal, and there's always something to keep you busy in it. If you're a zombie fan I recommend checking this one out if you never did or had the chance to.",1682653582,1682653582,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is not an FPS and to be honest, the fighting is kind of bad in this game.  Its in third person and when you get into close situations (as you will) the viewpoint often goes wonky.  It feels like the fighting might be better with a controller over keyboard/mouse but I haven't tried.

So forget zombie slaying, it's really not the game.  The game's forte is in simulating what it would be like to rebuild a community after an apocalypse.  It is sort of like Days Gone but with the emphasis on complex management of resources and less (so far) emphasis on being a bad ass horde killers (yay, Days Gone).  


The real-timeish nature, zombies, time, random events, other NPCs, etc. combine to put pressure on the player and often you have to accept that your strategies can quickly go to [cuss word].  So you have to improvise or go home and get stronger or pick a different survivor or gun or whatever  if you can't complete a mission right away.

You start out with about a half dozen survivors - they are always different and have their own personalities and moods (which you can deal with if it gets bad).  As you use them to complete missions and scavenge, they get infected or need to rest so you go back to base and activate another survivor to do the next mission.  You can try to build those survivors into specialists like scavengers vs. zombie killers vs. traders using the skill trees that you get access to with experience and so forth.  You can retire some of your survivors in order to pick up new ones with latent talents.  Another factor is building a home base and claiming outposts.  Outposts cost money to claim but bring other benefits such as better radio comms or running water (a morale booster).  There are a ton of different outposts and home bases to choose from so each game could take a different path.

The premise is great, the idea of clearing out and making a place better before leaving is a nice sentiment that is often unseen in a genre that's mostly about survival and escape.

But the developers almost seem to have gone out of their way to make this a chore instead of fun. Almost every mechanic in some way makes the game more annoying, or more tedious.

A great example of this is the inventory system. It's incredibly small. In theory this might lead to you picking and choosing what you want but the loot isn't gone so you can just kind of come back, adding to the loop.

Another is the quest system. You'll very frequently get quests to help others, even while you're doing what you're supposed to do, and if you ignore the quests those people will eventually shoot you on sight. It doesn't feel like I'm helping communities it feels like I'm babysitting children who eventually throw temper tantrums. At one point I did a quest just to get them off my back and I got two new quests before I was done.

The spawning system is so blatantly a spawning system you never feel like it ends at all. They have no problem spawning right in front of you, and at one point I was driving at top speed and two hordes spawned under me, flipping me into the air like a spinny top and dropping me down on someone who was following me. Luckily they didn't take any damage and honestly this was hilarious, but after I was done laughing I realized my car had taken a ton of damage and I had no part in that penalty.

All in all, tedious, badly designed, glitchy garbage with a great premise a younger me could get behind. An older me wants the game to shut up and let me kill the damn plague heart already.",1681267421,1681267421,False,1,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

Your home base is constantly under attack and constantly surrounded by zombies, mostly the ""special"" kind. Ferals, juggernauts, and bloaters are nearly as common as regular zombies which means you spend all of your time fighting zombies and 9 of every 10 missions expire or fail because you constantly get called back to your base or have to deal with half a dozen juggernauts going a half a mile across the map and burning a full tank in a vehicle that can barely hold anything (a cargo van can only hold 7 pistols, or books). It's overkill and just gets tedious.

Vehicles use an insane amount of gas and the controls are terrible. You can take things out of containers, but you can't put things in them. You can't let go of a locked door.

Great game to play solo and or coop, some things seem a bit outdated like to crosshairs for example as they're big and bulgy yet fit the system as they slightly change depending on weapon stats (range, type). Definitely worth the price as you can sink hours at a time into the game without boredom.

THE PROS:
• Multiple large and immersive maps that are fun to explore and gather resources. 
• The characters are well-designed with decent voice acting. 
• A nice variety of weapons and explosives. 
• You can drive and have different types of vehicles. I haven't seen that in most of the zombie games I've played, so it's definitely a nice addition. 
• Your actions have the potential for real consequences when it comes to losing survivors, or hostility towards other enclaves. 
• The ability to pick and choose what missions you want to accept. 

THE CONS: 
• The inability to create your own character or change the appearance of an existing character 
(outside of superficial outfit changes).
• Even though the voice acting is good, it seems the entire cast of characters share the same 3 or 4 voice actors. 
• Base building is EXTREMELY limited. You only get a small, handful of slots to customize your base. There's no way to rearrange any preexisting structures inside your base, either. 
• Even though you could infinitely keep playing this game by moving your survivors to new maps and bases, there's only a handful of missions before the finale and you're forced to start anew. 
• Maybe it's just me, but I feel like the zombies or ""zeds"" could look scarier. They look cartoonish and goofy compared to the realism of the survivors. 

With all that being said, I'd still recommend this game. It's addictive and unique enough to keep me coming back for more.",1680889308,1680889308,True,47,1,0.802518665790557861,0,True,False,False

First off the zombies need to be reworked completely they don't even look like zombies more like insane people who have lost they mind, I've played many games and this game kinda makes me feel like I'm playing a cartoon game when I see Microsoft's version of zeds.

Second and biggest reason why I don't recommend this game is because it requires a Microsoft account (which by the way will be ridding my computer of windows entirely soon) but also it requires an xbox live account even with the pc version of game I don't use Xbox because games for computers are 10 to 20x better and have allot more to offer. So be warned Microsoft may charge you even though you don't own an Xbox live account with them with the console as well.

Honestly people just need to realize that when someone buys something its they'rs there are no ifs or buts about it plain and simple one of the reasons why I buy games from steam because I know when I buy something unless its for testing purposes to explore new games to write about I know that the game will be mine and the developers don't have the right to keep charging people for multiplayer games unless its dlc's or additional packs for your character like game addons.

Also its the end of the world realistically you can have 100's of people join your community even though you can't or won't be able to play as them they can still fight and garden though I don't think there is any company out there that can best in open world games like Bethsada can from Skyrim because the map seams like its half the size then it should be.

A little fyi Microsoft when you put cars in a game whether it be military trucks to police cars all the way to civilian cars into a game the map has to be large enough so it be immersive allot of smart players if you want to call them that or people who know allot about game design and the actual game mechanics will all tell you that immersion is key in any game without it its just a side hobby that you all are doing and is just junk.

Days and Nights are way off, nights are longer then days? Who came up with that both need to be equal don't count dawn and dusk since there is about 2 hours of that in each day. Divide it by half so you get 12 hours subtract 2 hours from that for dawn and dusk then 5 hours for day and 5 hours for night, but for people to actually see the days and night cycles just put 2 and half hours for day and 2 and half hours for night.

The first base you get after completing the tutorial is way too small it can be expanded on the parking side to the right if your facing the where you enter from the short clip from the tutorial where your car is parked then look to the right there is plenty of space to grow and in the back of the base as well at least another 5 slots. I hate the fact about this game that it does not allow you to build or expand bases rather constantly moving to a bigger base I honestly think the influence should be used to build up the base your in right now to bigger size with more slots to build then rather moving and moving constantly trying to find a better home its realistic to stay put build up to support higher population and hate the 8 character limit in community even if you all allow players to have more then 8 in a community that does not mean you have to make them playable its for the immersion and each of those people can bring in a random small bonus not much but small bonus to either medicine or farming or utilities or whatever and can help defend against night and day attacks as well but if people want it harder just increase the amount of zombies with the cost of having additional people in your community and the only thing you can do with them is change there clothing and use what ever weapons stored in the supply locker you already have it set up all you all have to do is change a few numbers around to add random people join you community.

This is why I respect game modders more then game developers other then bethsada or biowear for exception, is because modders come out with things for games that they already know what people are looking for and want and not what they should stuff peoples throats with (kinda thing like ""what you see is what you get you morons"" thing).

Graphics are sluggish and not crisp not enough contrast. Nights have not improved just got darker and can't see crap, during the days indoors are way too dark and can't see anything in them other than the highlights from search icons for supplies.

After some consideration, I've decided that if Microsoft makes State of Decay 3, I would actually love it if they release it on steam! This is the only game that makes me feel at peace in terms of beauty of the world. One of those games that you start playing and always return to play again! I also wish that the bases would be larger with higher cap to recruits that can join, somewhere around 30. Also when leaving one map to the next that the player can take 5 rather then 3 people with you. When raiding buildings, I would strongly advise them to increase party size to 3. 5 would work too but would require military truck or civilian pick up trucks because those can carry 6 max. Cop cars sirens would need to be modified where the player has the noise on when driving with the lights flashing but when getting out of car if sirens with flashing lights left on would stay on except the noise only the flashing lights stay on.

The gameplay becomes repetitive quite quickly: gather resources, build various structures at the base, expand the base, move, and repeat. It gets boring faster than a zombie can eat you.
 Characters lack diverse personalities; in my opinion, they were better distinguished in the previous installment, but they can still be improved. It's understandable that unique personalities cannot be created for all, but some can be worked on to enhance the gaming experience and make the loss of characters feel more significant, rather than just ""darn, I have to level up a new one again."" There's no empathy for the lost character. Add various activities to the base that would allow characters to improve their stats, assign characters to work permanently at different buildings, and have non-playable characters (NPCs) fill these roles, but still allow the possibility to take them on expeditions. When there are no more survivors, NPCs, like a cook for example, could become the main characters, either to revive or join another group. It would be nice to have the option to join other groups if there's no main group left. It would be great if hostile groups attacked the base, stealing supplies and killing NPCs.

More diverse locations are desired, such as shopping malls, ski resorts, hotels, remote bases away from cities, bunkers, military bases, etc. In houses with a roof, it would be nice to have an attic to hide from zombie hordes if cornered. Also, it would be great to be able to drag large items like sofas, refrigerators, TVs, and cabinets back to the base if they are appealing, using disassembly and vans for transportation. It would be nice to learn how to collect a library from literature found in the game, so new characters can improve their skills faster to a minimum level, and then further improve them through practice, or have literature or movies provide a boost to skill growth. Skills should be more diverse, such as welding to access certain areas or disassemble cars on the road. Lockpicking would also be useful for silently breaking into houses or cars without attracting zombie attention, as you never know which car has an alarm. An electrician skill would be useful for assembling or upgrading the base's power system. In general, it would be nice to apply the principle of car customization to other aspects, as well as change the visual design of the base, providing more space for creativity. Draw graffiti on the walls of houses so your friends in co-op can easily find the place you're talking about.

I'm not even talking about construction skills, which could change a lot. Additionally, hunting, gathering, and many other features would be great to see in the game.

Moving certain gameplay elements from Project Zomboid to State of Decay can enhance the gaming experience of State of Decay by making it more engaging, realistic, and immersive. Here are some elements that can be borrowed from Project Zomboid:

In-depth character customization: In Project Zomboid, players can choose from a variety of professions and traits to create a unique character with specific abilities and drawbacks. Implementing a similar system in State of Decay would allow players to experience the game through different character builds and strategies.

More robust crafting and building system: Zomboid offers an extensive crafting system that allows players to create various items, weapons, and structures. Introducing a similar level of complexity in State of Decay would give players more ways to interact with the game world and create a more immersive experience.

Farming and cooking mechanics: Project Zomboid has an in-depth farming and cooking system that encourages players to be self-sufficient. Integrating these mechanics into State of Decay could promote long-term survival and provide an added layer of depth.

Expanded medical system: Project Zomboid has a comprehensive medical system, including different types of injuries, infections, and illnesses. Incorporating a more advanced medical system in State of Decay could make surviving and taking care of survivors more challenging and rewarding.

Dynamic weather system: Project Zomboid has an immersive weather system that can impact gameplay. Adding a similar feature to State of Decay would make the environment feel more alive and introduce new strategic considerations for players to deal with.

Stealth and distraction mechanics: Project Zomboid emphasizes the importance of stealth and using distractions to avoid or manipulate zombies. Implementing these mechanics in State of Decay could add more tactical options for players and increase tension during gameplay.

Longer-term survival challenges: Project Zomboid is known for its punishing difficulty and the need for long-term planning. Incorporating more complex survival challenges in State of Decay could make the game feel more intense and rewarding for players who enjoy a challenge.

Mod support: Project Zomboid has a thriving modding community that adds new content, features, and improvements to the game. Encouraging mod support for State of Decay could give players the ability to tailor the game to their preferences and extend its replayability.

More realistic zombie behavior: Project Zomboid's zombies have a more realistic and slower movement pattern. Adjusting the behavior of zombies in State of Decay to be more in line with this could create a more immersive and strategic gameplay experience.

Larger map and exploration: Project Zomboid features a massive map with a variety of locations to explore. Expanding the size and variety of State of Decay's map could provide players with a more engaging open-world experience.",1680078827,1680078827,True,10,2,0.519577324390411377,0,True,False,False

The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where the player must lead a group of survivors and build a community while fending off hordes of zombies and other dangers. The game has a strong emphasis on resource management, with players having to scavenge for food, water, medicine, and other supplies to keep their community alive.

One of the standout features of State of Decay 2 is its permadeath system, where if a survivor dies, they are gone for good. This adds an extra layer of tension and strategy to the gameplay, as players must carefully manage their resources and make tough decisions about which survivors to send on dangerous missions.

The game's graphics and sound design are serviceable but not particularly impressive. However, the game's strength lies in its gameplay, which is engaging and challenging. The combat system is satisfying, with a wide range of weapons and skills to choose from, and the base-building mechanics allow players to create their own unique communities.

The game also has a cooperative multiplayer mode, allowing players to team up with friends to take on the zombie apocalypse together.

Overall, State of Decay 2 is a solid open-world survival game that offers a challenging and engaging gameplay experience. While the game may not be for everyone, those who enjoy survival games and the zombie apocalypse genre are likely to find a lot to love in State of Decay 2.",1679603292,1679603292,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A lot of gameplay hours.
Dev added a lot of new maps since release
A new infestation rework is coming.

The only let down is the coop. While is it still fun, you are only a guest in your friend's world.
This mean you dont share characters and only use the one from your game. Also, cannot upgrade/build base.

Also, the base construction could have been a bit more complex.

Let's hope all this get better in State of Decay 3 !

8/10 game for both solo and Co-op, i pretty think this is a must !




Old review from 2020 when game released on Steam:

Overall, i've played this game like 50 hours on  Xbox Game pass. I really Like it and will continu to play. However, I cannot post a good review due to two things:

1- All my save files were NOT transfered in steam version. I know that I could have transfer manually my saves in the steam folder, however, when I uninstalled the game from the xbox app on Windows 10, it also deleted the save files. Since I dont want to pay a month of gamepass just to get my saves back, its pretty bad.

2- Multiplayer was bugged on Windows 10. Invisible zombies for guest players, guest players loosing connexion. All these bugs WERE NOT fixed on steam either, making multiplayer, the main attraction of the game, not working as it should. If at leat this problem is fixed, i'll think about changing my review for a good one.",1584296416,1679574040,True,0,0,0.468301147222518921,1,True,False,False

When you lose a valuable character because they hit a bloated zombie and the gas cloud kills them twice (once to take them down, then immediately after they recover) -- because the animation of getting out of a vehicle takes too long, well. That's painful. That's a consequence of bad game design, not skill.

When it happens a second time, it's a punch to the heart. And since I was already depressed when this happened to me, I kind of spiraled a bit. I downloaded the source code off of a torrent, printed it out, and used it as kindling in a secret fire ritual, deep in the mountains. It was the only way to cleanse the stench of this absolutely mediocre game from my spirit.

first off the game content is hardly created by deadlabs no they don't feel it is needed to put in almost no effort into .... 80% of the game

There is a reason why all the guns etc look the way they do.

It's due to the fact that it is all bought from what is called an online super market if you want to call it that.. where they pick what they want in the game and just drop the coding into the game.

They contract random people to do their work for them ( they are extremely lazy and don't want to lift a finger really)

Once again another lazy gaming company that I see as another EA and SE

How can you call yourselves a gaming company when you don't even do anything major and just slap your companies name and logo on and hardly or barely put any effort in it?

This is the reason why the game sucks meaning

This game continues to get new updates since its inception and continues to put out quality of life changes. Also a resource manager game. However, this isn't a bitch game. You want something that is 15 minutes across the map better have enough gas. No fast travel, and it has perma-death. My kinda game cause you only live once. So what do you do? Answer is easy try literally everything once. If there is an option for it try it. Only way you can learn and try to survive however it can in will get hard until you get your first taste of red talon who if you get enough operators will basically keep you alive through their passives.

There is building, a large variety of guns, ammo types, vehicles, base upgrades, character stats, community stats, everything you want from a zombie survival.  And having watched all of the Waling Dead, this is the closes game to the TV show.  With MANY parallels.  If you like zombie survival games, then give this one a try.  You will not be disappointed.

PROS:
- Wonderful Graphics
- Detailed Sounds
- Fun gun play
- Fun melee play
- Satisfying micro management/community management
- Variety of maps, characters and stories which help replay value
- Soundtrack

CONS:
- co-op is not true co-op and is limited.  Although better than nothing can be improved. 
- Map time lines can feel short at times.  For example as soon as you hit endgame base stuff and weapons you are prob finishing the last mission on the map

Originally I said that the game required an active internet connection on my Steam Deck, but after playing an additional 70 hours with weak/no internet, it's let me play just fine. I was originally frustrated that I was randomly asked to sign in again when I didn't have an internet connection, but since it hasn't bugged me. In total, I've had to sign in with Xbox twice: once when I first installed it and once right before I originally reviewed this.


Original Review: 
This game is great and I would recommend it to anyone who likes community management and zombies as long as they have internet. However I will not recommend any game that requires internet to launch or play the game. I have this on my steam deck and it's failing to load offline and wants me to sign back into Xbox. Which by the way, I'm playing on computer, not Xbox, but at least Xbox is also Microsoft so that works.

[u]Before I started, if you're looking for fully co-op zombies game. This game may not the best idea for you, and you friend[/u]

[Pros]
This is the Zombie Apocalypse, Open World, Survival, Base Building & Resources Management, during the gameplay, you may encounter a lot of event that related to life and death. You need to reclaim the town you've arrive with zombies-free zone. You can choose your own path and define your legacy in this game.

[b]""ALL SURVIVORS ARE UNIQUE""[/b] It's mean if you lost them or get them killed. They're gone forever.
Traits Feature is the most things I love this game! All of each survivors will have many different traits for both Positive and Negative. There are over 1,000 traits in the game. each survivors may have up to 4 or more traits in the game. So, every survivors you encountered. [u]They are unique[/u]

Skill and Upgrade progression for Survival also remarkable! All of your playable survival may have different skills. For example if your survivor have traits (or background)....
[u]Your survival was a Bus Driver[/u]: Drive any vehicle with more efficiency
[u]Your survival was an Army Veteran[/u]: Shoot with weapons with more accuracy, may use auto-rifle with more efficiency, etc.
Your survival was a Barista[/u]: Yup, they can brew some coffee for you! lol

[u]This game is not endless survival game[/u] But it's not just like One Time Play only! with the feature called ""Legacy"" this is what I may used to addicted this game so much!
During the gameplay, you may choose 4 path in the apocalypse world that lurking with zombies.
Builder: You believe that your base is everything to survive. Grow your own food, craft your own meds, and weapons!
Trader: You believe that trading is the key to survive. With fair exchange, may able to survive this apocalypse together
Sheriff: You believe that apocalypse like this need Laws and Orders. Thief and Murderer ain't welcomed here. And will tried to stop them or kill them if you had to. Not just for your own communities but all people in this town.
Warlord: Boom! Bang! RATATATTATATA! MOTHERF**KER I DON'T GIVE A F**K, YOU ALL DIED, I SURVIVE, B*TCH!!

After you finished your legacy path. You may have benefit to choose when you start a new game. such as Free Power and Water in base if you had Builder boons, Free Guns, Bullets and Grenades at start of the first base if you had Warlord boons. which will impact for your new game too.

Overall, the game is really cared about Unique Survivors the combat is somewhat satisfy. There are difficulty to choose, easy to lethal. This game is repeatable. With the base building. This game feel more alive in Zombie Apocalypse.

[Cons]
Multiplayer! If you thought you can play in the same team and the same world. Nope. It's not.
You may play with your friend and you became host. Your friend need to create his own Community to join your game. The survivors you played cannot be shared to your friends. Your loots and your friends loots are not shared. So, your friend can keep their loots without impact on your world. Though for joined player may not able to deposit some special resources. They need to log off to his own world to deposit them.
Your friend cannot do mission for you. Cannot move too faraway from the host (even though it's openworld game?). etc!
Your friend may not interact some base (like upgrade, spending resources to do some base action) for some reason

There are also bugs and game crash to be expected. And minor glitch too.
Well, let's called it a features.

I was big fan of state of decay. Waited for this game expecting something much better. What I got did not make me happy, I was specially not found of the new graphics which was blurry for me. Played a bit and forgat about it. Until I found out some mods which makes it a new game. And I have 27 hours of fun so far. Game overall is good, all you need to is to get a car fix, which only incease capacity just a bit and make fuel consumption just a bit less, so feels like kind of realistic. And for the guys who can not stand the graphics go ahead and use reshade mod. I made mine like borderlands comic looking, and it is crisp and it rocks ! 

Now after just 2 mods, my game became 8/10 from somewhat 5/10.

You can see images before and after reshade;

Just feels like its missing something that add longevity, their difficulty balance is weird, the game isnt hard, and on the higher difficulties their vision of difficulty is just Blood freak spam.

Co-op kinda sucks, so if youre buying purely for co-op i would skip, as you dont actually share the same hideout, whoever joins your server is just ""helping"" I dont want help, i wanted to have a fun playthrough with my brother.

Unfortunately there are enough poorly thought out design choices and game-breaking bugs that I have to recommend you stay away from this one.  If you do play it, stay away from higher difficulties, or resign yourself to frustration.  Also be warned that the game's multiplayer is only for the two least-played modes (Daybreak, and the special story mode).

There are a lot of good things to say about this game.  The gameplay loop is fun - the balance of zombie-killing action, resource-gathering and base-management is a great combo.  The characters and their dialogue are diverse enough that it takes a while for them to get stale (though I eventually found myself turning off the characters' spoken audio).  I personally didn't get into the Daybreak mode - I find there are better games for fighting zombie hordes.

The game features perma-death, which ramps up the tension of survival.  It's heartbreaking when a character succumbs to the zombie plague just seconds before they can reach the cure.  It's triumphant when a survivor stuck deep in zombie territory survives the long Odyssey home after their vehicle blows up on the wrong side of the map.  It can be frustrating, but ultimately the game gives the player enough tools to mitigate the risk and come back from character deaths that it doesn't feel entirely unfair.

What does feel unfair is when challenges ramp up or deaths occur as the result of game-breaking bugs.  I won't list all the (numerous) bugs I encountered, but I will say that my last game had a series of increasingly frustrating bugs that ended in a soft-lock.  The game loaded with my character in an inaccessible place, with no way out.  I struggled to get my character killed rather than lose the more than hundred hours I'd spent on the save file.

Though, for that matter, why play a game where that's a genuine possibility?  The game advertises replayability, with stacking rewards for multiple playthroughs.  That is greatly undermined when you can lose everything for no reason, and with no recourse.  The difficulty of your game should not come from unfair game-breaking bugs.  Players should not be frustrated that one mis-click on a poorly-designed menu will lock them into a map where their only options are to abandon their save, or slog through a few dozen hours of grinding gameplay.  When you advertise multiplayer, it should probably be included in your main game instead of just the side modes.

Though the game wears the clothes of one that can be played for a long time with increasing difficulties and rewards, that's an illusion.  The game-breaking bugs will stymie the otherwise strong gameplay loop.  If you decide to play this game, know that it'll be fun for a little while, but won't hold up at higher difficulties.  Also know that the game's open-ended story doesn't really have a conclusion (at least not one meant to provide any meaningful resolution).",1677221944,1677221944,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I personally use only 2 .. 900 storage and 100 vehicle inventory. 

If you play the game as it is, you will be doing a lot of driving. It will be more like ""DRIVING SIMULATOR"" but bad driving simulator and you wont be able to focus on the game that much. 
There really isnt any story, just some minor story quest line. Rest of the quests are totally optional, you either do them and get good neighbors you can maybe recruit if you want their skills, or dont do it and they leave, new ones will come later or become hostile but wont actually do anything, they just stay in their home, wont assault you.

The world isnt really alive, everything is scripted, predetermined. If you want more zombies, increasing difficulty wont actually help, they are just harder to kill. If you ignore the world, they wont spread, multiply or something. Zombies protect their ""homes"", lets say hives called heart .. if you destroy it, thats it. No new will appear. 

You can walk or drive the car, problem is, your inventory is bigger than car's inventory. You can have up to 12 spaces for items, cars have only like 4. 
Your base storage fully upgraded to like 80 can barely hold 10 days worth of food .. depends on how many people you have. If you store more, you will start losing it on its own. You are not allowed to save it in any way, you can put them into cars but then you would need to have 100 cars around your base. Thus the mods.
The put everything into the storage and the car so you can actually spend some time exploring and fighting zombies.

Zombies sometimes do SIEGE on your base but its pathetic, 5 zombies will try to attack you. The attacks needs to lot more savage. I can completely ignore the sieges on my bases when exploring, no one ever died in my base. I died few times by not paying attention :) 

Game even on lethal is kinda super easy, currently looking for mods that makes the game much more difficult. More zombies, more hearts, more infestations, bigger siege attacks, something that makes the game more challenging and actually makes me think for a second.

Missing any kind of PHOTO MODE or a key to hide HUD for convenience.
Some more GPU options would nice too .. like turn off film grain. 
Option to allow more zombies in your vision, to chase you longer etc.

It was day 27 of the zombie apocalypse, and I was taking my favorite character out for scavenging. I'd recently ran out of gas, so I decided, what the heck, I'll just run to the nearest potential gas site... over half a kilometer away. This may not sound that far to you, but in the zombie apocalypse, half a kilometer on foot is like the journey your grandparents traveled to and from school back in their day: uphill both ways, in 5 feet of snow, with only a raw potato for lunch. But I'm no dummy. So before heading out, I grabbed a vial of plague cure, along with a bunch of stimulants, in case I happened to get into trouble...

Flash forward about 45 minutes. My favorite character is sprinting back to base, having contracted blood plague for a SECOND time this trip, after using up the one vial of plague cure I brought along. The timer at the bottom left of the screen is counting down the seconds until my guy drops dead from the plague. Meanwhile, there are three. Count. THREE Ferals (cat-like zombies that run on all fours and hate you and everyone you know) sprinting after me. My dude is downing stimulants like they're fricken Tic Tacs, while hauling butt back to base. He's bobbing and weaving like he's the star of a new Rocky movie, as these ferals hurl past him every couple seconds trying to slice through him like warm butter. But my guy has quads of steel, glutes that could crack open a walnut, and enough stimulants in him to kill a small country, so he just keeps on trucking. I'm on the edge of my seat, actively shouting at the screen, squeezing my controller to death, and implementing any other proven tactics I can think of for increasing the speed of my character.

Finally, I throw the door open to my base as my other community members gather to beat the ever-living heck out of these stupid ferals (it was a joyous moment). The timer has three seconds left on it as I down a vial of plague cure from my supply locker. My guy was safe. The relief I felt was better than having a scheduled phone call be canceled. Pure bliss.

The next day, my favorite character ran into a bloater while driving, contracted blood plague, and was then beaten into the ground by a Juggernaut. Devastation... like going over to a friend's house for a sleepover and realizing you forgot to bring an extra controller.

I will never forget you, favorite character, whose name has escaped me.

One of the better survival horror, open world, build your base/community zombie games out there. My first game, I played the first few hours with settings: Action = Nightmare & Map = Lethal. Lost a guy, got depressed and figured I'm ready to restart with a new community on Lethal on a different map LOL. Haven't looked back. Good times! 

Pros: 
- Scratches that itch when you're lookingn for base building survival horror, without the PVP BS shenanigans. 
- Survivors with their own quirk skills/trait to make them more unique. 
- Build up your base/community. 

Con: 
- Random BS spawning. 
- Need Microsoft Xbox Live account... which is free to get and is only needed to start the game, can turn off your internet afterwards. Tested it myself. 
- Game save is cloud based so no cheating.
- Wish the base building was more detailed and elaborate. 

Recommendation: Yes. If you like SURVIVAL HORROR, OPEN WORLD, BASE/COMMUNITY BUILDING, ZOMBIE/MONSTER games. 

Note: 
- Base building/crafting is simplified so you don't lay down blueprint and build your own layout and stuff.
- There's multiple difficulties so don't complain that you suck and it's hard. Just stick to GREEN MODE.",1638357245,1676923023,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I still lose survivors from time to time. The game is very detailed which makes it enjoyable to look inside houses and other buildings.

I’ll make it quick, but game design is smart, atmosphere is real, fun isn’t forgotten, base building is very rousing, gears choice is wide, difficulty is balanced, randomization’s keeping the curiosity, etc.
Quests variety and directing could have been better, more maps would have been way better to spend even more time on it, history is… there’s none it’s a sandbox survival which is ok, at least for me.
But all in all, this is a freaking really good game, worth any money. One of the rare games I replayed multiple times.

One of the most generic open-world zombie games ever that somehow manages to do (almost) everything extremely well. Depending on the difficulty you play on it's either going to be a boring, repetitive experience  or a thrilling, high-stakes survival horror game that keeps you hooked for hundreds of hours.

Multiplayer works like a charm 90% of the time. Performance could be better at times and the game's potential is slightly handicapped on PC because of the console version. It's not perfect but comes ever so close.

The game has a lot going for it.  Game play, graphics, and concept all work well.  I liked a lot of what I saw and how the game worked.

Unfortunately, I would say give this game a pass unless you really like zombie games and REALLY like grinding.

The game starts strong but, while I played over 30 hours, most of that felt repetitive and a little tedious.  I found little reason to experiment with new strategies or weapon load outs.  I ignored about 90% of the features and options (radio stuff etc.) as either ineffective or not worth the bother to click on it.  I also found that I quickly started to ignore side missions, especially as all my survivors maxed out their various stats/abilities.

Even the driving feature of the game wore out it's welcome almost immediately.  While the cluttered roads are very appropriate, I found that I actually dreaded having to use vehicles as the ""fast travel"" option they were meant to be.  I tended to use them only for trips to the opposite sides of the map and then only after I had already explored most of the map on foot.

The base building aspect is also very underwhelming, simply filling slots with whatever options fits your needs best at that point in time.  Again, many options getting ignored simply because it wasn't worth the trouble.

A expandable starter base with missions to loot other abandoned bases for expansions and new facilities would have been a more interesting and engaging way to go.

So, if the concept appeals to you then you could probably get you money's worth out of the game (especially on sale).  Just don't expect anything too grand or in depth (it is a $30 - $40 game after all).",1676098402,1676098402,False,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

This game is addicting first and foremost, finding weapons, managing your community, finding survivors to join the cause and just smashing zombies is just fun and keeps you engaged. While there are some features I would change in the game, the overall principle of the game is great. When playing on harder difficulties is where the game shines. The lack of materials, the absolute threat of a horde or a feral lurking about is truly terrifying and could cost you tons of time invested in a character and the community. It's this more hardcore difficulty that makes me really enjoy the game, but also one that makes me wish there were some new mechanics either implemented in a patch or hopefully in the third installment of the game.

If you are on the fence with this game and have Game Pass, I highly recommend you give this game a try and play it on a harder difficulty and with a mindset of pure survival.

Anyway, this game is set in a beautiful post-apocalyptic world with so much to explore and uncover, I love sneaking around hordes of zombies to explore the buildings, uncover the story of that building, what happened there, what can I salvage to help me on my way. This is where the game fails first, there is no story to uncover, just loot and maybe you'll find some survivors that want you to help them destroy a horde and then trade. That is as deep as it gets.

Still, even though the story is handed to you rather than uncovered, I really enjoy the exploration aspect. The combat is great too, you get an amazing sense of satisfaction from dropping a bunch of zombies. The combat is well thought out too, you can just go charging to a horde and expect to make it out, you can get overwhelmed quite easily. 

There is a base management aspect in this game, you have to select a home and then build defences, gardens, beds, and an infirmary, ensuring you and your group have what you need. You have to manage the people, some of them will be trouble or grow weary and it is your job to manage that.

This is the second big problem for me. The game is constantly telling me something else needs doing, every single time I leave the home camp to go exploring a new area I get notifications that the base is under attack, or a new survivor has radioed in for help, or one of the group is arguing etc. When a survivor group asks for help and you don't go to their aid, you will lose their trust, and after a while, they become an enemy. There is a core concept of plague zombies, these are zombies that are under the effects of a plague heart in the nearby area. When you or your community get attacked by these zombies in close combat you will get infected. You can cure this by collecting 'samples' dropped by the infected and then using these at the infirmary to create the vaccine. If you take a community member with you on a mission as backup, they will be guaranteed to get infected, so once again, the burden is on you to ensure they make it back to camp in time, brew up a vaccine and apply it. Grind....

It is too busy, with too much happening at the same time. It feels like the game is trying to be several games in one, a city manager, an exploration game, and a good ol' third-person action game. Most of the time I just ignore the survivors unless I'm in the area, they get all upset with me, so when I pass by I will make a load of noise to draw a horde in and voila, no more mardy survivors.

Don't get me wrong, I like the game, I will keep going back to the community that I've created to advance it a little more. But I will always get frustrated after a while and put it down. If you like post-apocalyptic games set in an open world with some excellent combat, get this game. It is good, it is excellent in fact. Just be prepared to grind a little. I'm sure there are methods of reducing this, maybe just exile everybody in your community and go lone wolf.- hmmm might try this in a fresh game.

First of this is more of an open sandbox were i get bombarded with quest to help every single person within a few minutes or they will get pissy and some ends up leaving,
Trying to do anything while having to cross the map over and over gets due to this gets super tedious.
Then you have the abysmal AI that sometimes refuse to get in to a car when it is next to them and they just stand there staring at it.
They also like to roll away from the car like they are about to get hit even when you some times stand still and there is really no way to control them so the guy with that nice shiny gun? Watch him run up to a swarm of enemies to melee them just to get fucked and run away a few meters at the most.

In short AI is horrible game play is about the same as 1 except they added a lot of stuff but most of it is tedious IMO
Not sure how to put it but controls also feels bad as you can aim at the back of the car and all of a sudden you will be launched in to the drivers seat instead of refueling said car.
And before i forget a big chunk of my dead/severely injured characters is because of ladders not ""working"" properly as even slow walking up to them has sent a lot of my characters falling down to the ground, I did learn that there is a work around by aiming your gun before going to the ladder but that is still shitty design.",1675345924,1675345924,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Well, if you ask me, I could write about this title for hours but... you don't have hours to spend, do you? So, tell you what: let's cut to the chase and you go check my game time! Isn't that enough of an answer?

Also, [i]Undead Labs[/i] gets points from me for still updating this game to this day with various degrees of new content and with some new mechanics as well, even when deep into developing State of Decay 3. It has a solid fan base despite not having the best multiplayer options. I mean, it is fun to play with friends and with random players but it is hardly rewarding if you simply join someone else's game as you are just helping the other guy around and not developing your own community at all (if not with some totally forgettable loot). But still, it is an experience I suggest you to make.

If you want to feel all the thrills this game has to offer, you have to go for [b]Lethal Difficulty[/b] [i](Hello, permadeath!)[/i]. It's way beyond hard if you are not used to the game mechanics but if you learn the ropes well it will eventually become the only game mode you will want to experience with your community.

Ahhh, if only we could have workshop support or a good world editor! You know, for when the five maps included in the game become a little too familiar. There's absolutely nothing in that department.

Some tips too: go for [b]Marathon[/b], [b]Stealth[/b], [b]Swordplay[/b] and [b]Gunslinger[/b] specializations and you won't have much of an hard time trying to keep your survivor alive. Even lethal difficulty will be manageable, in my experience. You can also hire some [b]Red Talon[/b] contractors using the currency earned by playing [b]Daybreak[/b] mode (not the most fun game mode, in my opinion, but some things you unlock there will be made available for your community to use). Oh, and travel light. I mean, really light. Equip some [i]ultralight[/i] backpack if you find any. It stores less stuff but you will be quick if paired with a Stealth/Marathon specialization. This combo has saved the neck of my survivors many times already!

I've recently been back to SoD2 and I do LIKE what is see:
A lot of bugs, that kept me from playing in the early stages have been solved. Graphic and game mechanic updates over time renewed my love for the SoD serie as a whole.
PC port is so much more reactive and on point, then it has been, physics bugs (like your car driving over a zombie, becoming an uncontrollable spacecraft tumbling across the map) still happens, but very very rarely.
Some things are still a bit fuzzy, or difficult to understand (like some survivor skills) or NPC behaviour (aka the AI for combat), but that's just a quirk.

So Overall: At start SoD2 was a mess, and xbox features only made them worse. But now this game is quite enjoyable (as solo player game), and Dev updates indicate, that although they are working hard on SoD 3, there are planned updates for SoD2.

Therefore I also change my recommendation from ""hell no"" to ""Yes please"".
State of Decay 2 Juggernaut Edition is worth the money!
Happy Zombie slappin, survivors!



******* below old review ******

I love State of Decay - bugs, glitches, weird mechanic and all.
It always felt much more like a good zombie survival + building game then a lot of the other games out there, and it sure felt engaging and immersive. Learing about your small community of survivors and misfits - story mode or beyond - was just awesome. So I spend a lot more hours in SoD1 then a buggy game would usually deserve.
So when SoD2 finally hit PC I just had to get it!

Apparently lots of youtubers talked about how much better the 2nd part is and how much the Devs worked on it. How much more there is to build, explore, and experiance... and there sure is.

BUT here starts my review after 19 hours of SoD2 in 2 different game modes on 3 different maps with 4 different starter characters:


With SoD2 YOU GET THE SAME BUGS/GLITCHES as in SoD1!! Period!

They are occuring much less often, but they do. It took me just ~1 hour into the game, when I drove my car over a regular zombie and lift off the ground propelling like a boomerang. Then, about 1 hour later, I had a Screamer that was stuck in a car wreck right outside the first base - glitching there like in a Bethesda game. Screaming on and on and on, spawning in so many zombies I lost 2 of 4 survivors.
Zombies spawning inside environment (and being unkillable) is a constant problem in SoD2 - as well as the fact, that zombies just spawn behind your back. You clear a open piece of land, you turn around, and you get new spawns right away. Zombies just grow out of the blue... 

Beside this the story pace is a bit off putting in normal story mode.
If you haven't played SoD1 (where you learn about the diff kind of Zeds), you will learn about them in this part only by running into them. The Tutorial and the popp-ups ARE really helpfull teaching you basic mechanics, but everything else is not explained (unless you count the kind-of-encyclopaedia, you might find by chance in the menu).
Also the general threat advances far more rapidly then in SoD1 - in each session (normal mode) zombies kept spawning near by although each infestation were delt with in minutes (btw: cars are still the way to go, to deal with large numbers).
Same goes for social problems. My second group kinda broke apart after 4-5 hours because of inner-group disputes (between the 2 start characters, mind you!!).

A problem on top is, that the characters are far less endearing then in SoD1. The survivors' story (building a base then dealing with zombies) is very generic - and there is no problem with that - but when your characters don't keep you involved, and they are just tools to solve certain mechanics, the character's story becomes obsolete - a bit of a problem in a RP-element Zombie survival game.

Don't forget about the control bzw - SoD isn't the first PC game, that uses a wibble wobbley console control conversion. unnecessary turn arounds (because your frikken characters can't take a step back, like you are used to in every PC game aiming a range weapon) ends you up presenting your neck to a zombie almost every time you're in a fist fight. And btw you can fly... er... i mean fall off a cell phone tower ever so often, when you step next to a ladder, and your character steps on and not net to said ladder. Wheeeeeeee SPLORT!
I wish you could at least re-assign all of your keys...

On the very positive side...
..I need to mention the new skill feature - which is really neat! You can find books around the world, so characters without special skills can learn one. Got no mechanic in your group?? Read ""How To Become A Mechanic 101"" and you're ready to pimp that ride!

Also UN-STUCK option via map UI - this is really something the game needed!

Also a nice thing are cosmetics you can find around the map. Open a random container and maybe you'll find a stylish cowboy hat, or a fancy ninja outfit. Doesn't change stats but sure makes your fav character look rad!

And the diff game modes/maps are REALLY neat. You can even return to the overrun and blood plague infected map of SoD1 - and if you played SoD1, just driving through it is worthwhile!

+++++++++++++++++
Overall: 
I will keep playing SoD2, at least till I finished the main story, but giving the development and conversion time for PC, I have to admit I am dissapointed by the gameplay and occurence of year old bugs/glitches.
Sure, some things will always turn up in one way or the other, still self propelling cars, stuck enemies and weirdly generated zombie hordes on top of rocks, cliffs and buildings you cannot get up to or even aim up to, because you can't aim straight up or down in this game, are redicolous.

So my recommandation to all who played SoD1: if you loved the game, you can check out SoD2
To all who didn't play SoD1 or didn't like it: get yourself another game!

edit (OUTDATED)

about 6 hours after I wrote this negative review the game itself had severe connection problems.
(that happens when you design a game, that needs 24/7 internet connection for it's single player OFFLINE content. Didn't Microsoft learn about ""It's not a bug, it's a feature"" before?)

Anyway: 2 hours later Microsoft locked my account down for ""suspicious activities"", meaning normal single player gaming WITHOUT any kind of mods, loosing connection because of bad servers making one log in every few minutes (mind you I'm working with a steady 2000kb glass fiber connection here), which xbox bots deem as ""suspicious activity"". *sigh*

Anyway - That is the second time I got problems with the Xbox / Microsoft account service after writing a negative review about a Microsoft game. Of course this is just coincident, but it shows me, that my negative review was on point. And for all this game is (not) worth, I actually don't care about trying to regain acess of this 'game'.

State Of Decay 2 is just a polished rebrand of the original State of Decay 1 with a inferiour UI, less story, less engagement, an unfinished and not thought through coop-mode. It will most likely leave SoD1 veterans with a sour taste in their mouths - after throwing 30€ into the gutter for a buggy game. 

edit edit: just learned you cannot play co-op over Steam, but you need to pay the 9,99 monthly fee, to play the game with your friends (who also need to pay 9,99 per month) via Xbox-client. So if you're not in the Xbox-Club, don't buy it.",1584391969,1675242763,True,0,0,0.766226887702941895,0,True,False,False

I only have a dash over 28 hours into the game, But let me tell you some GOOD take aways that I have gotten from State of Decay 2. (Worth noting) I DID NOT play state of decay 1. So my take will be a fresh take on playing this series starting with ""State of Decay 2"".

1. SOD2 has a really decent RPG aspect to the game. You can have multiple survivors (Up to 12 total) with DIFFERENT traites to help the entire community. I believe there are over 25 different traits (including passive traits). The More you use the skill, the higher the skill ranks up. You can even make your citizens ""heros"". this is a good thing. then, when your time is up and you are ready to move on to a different map, you can upload your characters, (up to 50) to the legacy pool and us these heros again in another map. VERY COOL.

2. SOD2 has a DECENT base building aspect of the game. You build your base and defend the base and the people in it from zombie attacks. ALTHOUGH this IS a MINER aspect of the game, it is still fun and relevant to the game at hand. depending on how you build your base and defenses. also determines on how often you will be attacked. there are things you can build and put into place to lower your awareness to the zombies. this can be useful depending on your play style.

3. SOD2 IS a sandbox AND a completion story all in one. I beat the game and I am still playing on the same map. So, I would equate this style of game play akin to ""KENSHI"" (Another REALLY GREAT GAME). 

I know this is not really an indepth game review, but I would like to say this as a final thought. IF you are THINKING about trying a game that has RPG elements, Could be a sandbox, You WANT to sink a lot of hours into, You can try Multiple DIFFERENT ways of winning, And you CAN have a REAL challenge OR you can be VERY casual....then this game is REALLY calling to YOU. Try it out. You WILL be Happy that you did.

on the other hand i have never seen a more messier game than this...

and then theres the so called ''lethal'' difficulty which literally is so unbalanced no matter how much you actually grind you dont get rewarded at all its truly just frustration and frustration you have to be a extra masoschist to enjoy it so much for hard difficulty when you literally just up the hp of literally everything to the point enemy raiders one shot you and you have to shoot them like 4 times in the head before they even can be knocked down

and after all this i still try to enjoy this spaghetti mess of a game because like i said game is amazing when it works

Not into survival games esp ones with perma death, but I'm glad I gave this one a try and now I cannot stop playing. It's a great game, but I'll have to start off with one of it's biggest sins. IMO you get to end game way too fast. The campaign ends too abruptly so it's kind of a bummer later on when I have a lot of resources and items but can't really enjoy them coz I know it's about to end. Sure you get your boons and you can continue on with your community to a new map and even save your leveled up survivors for later use, but it's not enough to make me feel like the reward is worth what I'm losing at the end. This plus the fact the maps are kind of small, the story is more of an afterthought and the zombies a bit underwhelming esp mid-game, eventually make the game feel pointless and I have to actively slow down my quest progression just to be able to enjoy what I've built. For a sandbox game, it feels like a DLC and I wish it wasn't like that.

Heartland is a nice little extra if you want something with more of a story and a chill introduction to the game's mechanics. Don't expect too much of the story tho. Just think of it as a long intro/tutorial mode with a sort of linear path. I would recommend new players to start with Heartland before jumping into the campaign.

Daybreak is too repetitive and grindy for me. You get nice rewards that you can use in your campaign which is cool, but I just personally don't enjoy the game mode.

Customizable difficulty is a dope feature and I'm glad it's there.

One minor gripe that kind of turns me off is how large some of the weapons look esp assault rifles and submachine guns on female survivors, but this is just me being nitpicky.

Combat is better than I expected. Guns sound and feel great, which is a big plus for me and I was pleasantly surprised to discover some depth to melee combat. Blunt weapons can CC, bladed weapons do high single enemy DPS, but degrades faster, etc. You can execute different moves depending on both the weapon type and skills you choose to upgrade. Pretty dope. Weapon customization would've been awesome, but whatever.

Follower AI is not good. Just go out solo or you'll risk getting one of your survivors killed. Learned that the hard way. Watched my first favorite survivor try to melee 3 hostiles with guns and got wrecked. She was the lover of my warlord leader and that made him cold and merciless. It sucked that she died, but great for role-playing lol.

Some game mechanics are frustrating, like timed side missions or if when your survivor gets fatigued during a main quest and needing to switch to a different survivor will make you abandon that quest. Maybe there's a way around this that I don't know about, otherwise I just either abandon the quest and wait for it to restart or push thru it with no stamina. Sucks.

I do not play multiplayer, but if you're into that then you'll probably enjoy it like a lot of people seem to do.

Visually, it's alright. It's not ugly, but it eynt that pretty either. Some textures look great and sometimes it looks cartoony, which isn't a bad thing. It works. Night time is really dark, which is realistic I guess, but it's still too dark in your base even if it's powered.

Please add weather cycles. Be nice to see rain, snow, fog or even thunderstorms every now and then.

Performance is good. Consistently runs 60fps at 1080p running max settings with my Ryzen 5600G and RTX 3060 and have only had a couple of very minor bugs overall.

Vehicles are alright IMO. Good handling, upgradable and I've never had any issues with running out of fuel or totaling the vehicle. With some care, of course. The vehicles could use more item slots tho. It's kind of dumb that some backpacks have more item slots than most vehicles. Traveling back and forth from a looting area to an outpost is just tedious. Some of the special vehicles look corny as hell, but that's completely subjective and I'm fine with it since I have plenty of simple vehicles to choose from. Please please please add motorcycles.

Base building and management is fun and satisfying. Plenty of facilities to choose from with different and very specific functions that can be changed or unlocked depending on your survivors' skills. Then there are base mods that you can install to either add or augment a facility function. Pretty cool. I just wish there was a way to make your base completely zombie-proof. I mean, you're capable of having all these high tech stuff (which I won't spoil), but zombies can still just casually open your gates and jump your fences? It doesn't make sense. Parking cars to block doorways isn't something players should have to resort to as a defensive strategy. If we can build watchtowers then we should be able to build higher walls and for the love of god, locked gates.

There's a lot to love about the game. Just keep your expectations in check and you should be able to enjoy it without getting too disappointed when it ends. That having said I still do recommend trying it out if you're into this sort of game. Looking forward to future updates and more from Undead Labs.",1674787385,1674788690,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are many problems with this game that I would like to comment:

· There is no actual plot the game does not keep the player entertained throughout the whole game. All you have to do is complete some boring missions that are pretty repetetive. Your main goal is to just survive and grow your community which at certain point of the game becomes pointless. Since you are in a very small limited map

· The game for me is more like minecraft in survival mode with many limits and issues:
- Very bad building system, I have only few slots to build something on my base and no matter which map I choose I will be still have that limit. Also, takes too long to build them sometimes.
- Constant bugs or glitches where either my car or npc just get stucked in and then I just have to leave it as it be since there is no way of fixing it
- The command center does not allow to control more than 5-6 outposts which creates a huge limit and you just have to take much more time looking for resources than focusing on your missions. Since outposts are the only place that can give you constant resources and since you need many different resources like food, medicine, electricity etc. you have to look for the rest of the resources that the outposts can provide you with.

· A wrong multiplayer regime!
Players can only join to the game of their friends help them gather resources and aid them during raids but can not really interact in the missions (which are again very repetetive) with you. Also, they have to leave their resources in the storage if you want to use them. Basically, you can't play with your firends propperly since you can't initiate the game with them and still they have no rights when they play with you. I mean like building stuff in the base or even play while you are out. They can only join when you are playing which makes no sense.

· The zombies keep surrounding you base which affects the community mood and in the end you have to waste time killing them all to maintain a good mood in the community. 

· It could be way better if there were servers, or if in the game the communities were real (played by real people). Instead its just bunch of npc in constant need of resources or help with zombies who do not even help you in any way they are just pointless.  

· The only way to entertain a bit is to play on high difficulty level since on those levels it takes few seconds for you to die.

There many other issues with this game that I could write about a whole book but I just don't want to spend anymore time on this game

Tbh its better to play many other alternatives of zombie games like dying light, left for dead etc. The game just doesn't have anyhting unique in it.

NEGATIVES/GRIPES:

--How enemy spawns work can be a little bit irritating. Zombie spawns center around two things: the player's location and your base's location. On one hand, this adds excitement in the sense that there are ALWAYS zombies around to endanger you. And yet, it does sometimes result in a feeling that a horde of zombies materialized out of thin air behind you (though the game mostly hides it well) and something that could only be described as ""spawn creep"". When you first load your game, there are a reasonable number of zombies outside your base. But the longer you play, the hordes and super zombies outside your base grow in number and strength to the point it starts to get a little ridiculous. It's like the zombie spawn equivalent of a memory leak. You can just reload your save to reset the spawns if it gets too obnoxious. I find myself questioning if the spawn creep is by design or if there is just something wrong with spawning behavior. The standard difficulty says the super zombies (""freaks"") should be mostly isolated threats, but that's not really true once the spawn creep progresses enough. You will have two juggernauts, three ferals, 2 screamers, and a bloater outside your walls before you know it. 

--You will definitely have to google some things. Sometimes just because the game doesn't explain it when you need it, sometimes because the game doesn't explain it thoroughly or clearly enough, and sometimes (rarely but sometimes) something makes no sense or isn't explained at all and you just plain have to ask reddit. One example is if your group leader is the BUILDER leader type, you get a story mission (i.e. mandatory to beat the map) that tells you to build or upgrade a facility. But if you are already at max facilities with max upgrades, it doesn't count it. Reddit confirms: in this case if you have already completed the objective, the game doesn't know. You have to destroy a facility, then build it back in order to trick the game into thinking you just built it. Stupid sh** like this happens in this game, so you're gonna have to meet it halfway sometimes.

--Other humans are a little annoying. Different groups of survivors populate on the map, and they will radio you and ask you if you'll do things for them CONSTANTLY. It is CONTANT. If you do it, they become friendly, stay on the map, and become a kinda permanent trading post and potential recruitment pool. Cool. But if you are working on something else, like eliminating plague hearts or infestations, and you just ignore them because you're busy, they will accuse you of being a monster and an a***ole and only caring about yourself and they might even becomes hostile toward you and attack you on sight if they see you. This seems a little absurd. ""Both our groups are struggling to survive out here, and I know you're technically helping me by clearing the infestations that are endangering my life, but could you drop everything you're doing and bring me a pencil sharpener in the next five minutes? No? WELL F*** YOU THEN. YOU BETTER HOPE I DON'T SEE YOU."" You just have to learn to ignore it and live with it.

--Similarly, the game constantly nags you to ""clear infestations"". Your allies in your base nag you with voice lines about it, you get notification nags about it, and you get morale penalties for having too many on the map. But even if you go out and clear 3 or 4 of them from the map, they'll immediately respawn before you even make it back to your base. The spawn rate on them is so obnoxious that you'll just end up ignoring them and accepting the morale penalty. They are extremely not worth your time, despite all the nags. 

--Some stuff I just plain don't understand why it is like it is. for example, if a zombie latches onto your car door, there is a button you can hold or tap to either hold the door open (to slam them into something) or to shake the door (to try to shake them off). If you don't remove them, they eventually pull off your door, and the next zombie to latch will pull you out of the driver seat. But if a feral type zombie attaches to your door, the door-shake button no longer functions, and so they pull your door off every time. Is this deliberate? A bug? I have no idea.

Positives:

--Cocaine for loot goblins

--The combination of action, stealth, looting, and management is excellent and all I want in a game. I love that mix. Combat could be slightly better in some places but is extremely good enough. Management stuff takes a while to understand in full, but it's deep enough and customizable enough to be satisfying. The game encouraging you to occasionally move your entire base of operations to a new point on the map is pretty cool, and I appreciate that it makes this easy to do (from a management perspective.... there are still zombies.)

--The maps are very large and great to explore. You can go inside of almost every building and loot them, and securing different vehicles that still function and trying to get them back to base is a great hook for base management. (They add transportation, but are also weapons, but also augment your storage in unique ways.)

--The legacy survivor system and leadership boon system after ""beating the game"" on a map is pretty cool and generously implemented from a QOL viewpoint. I had trouble understanding their explanation of it, but it's nifty.

--Survivor settlement system is what you wish the Fallout 4 settlement system was like. 

--Being able to control every individual members of your group and instantly switch between them is pretty awesome.

--Trying to slowly assemble your ultimate survivor squad via the legacy system as you beat map after map is a great long term goal to keep you playing new maps. Trying to win with every leader type is also a great hook to keep you playing through the entire campaign again and again.

The Campaign isn't really one at all, but rather, a sandbox with a lot of gathering side missions and clearing maps.  You can bring all your toys (people/gear/etc) and go to another map, but it feels empty.  You can keep manually increasing difficulty if you like, but?  I like progressive difficulty with a story and steps toward the end.  Once you have a full auto shotgun and some bombs, you can zip through plague hearts in the Campaign.  But its good (and I felt necessary) training for Hearland.
Heartland is a story driven no-looking-back approach and I had some close calls, and some heartbreaking fails (I lost my master gunsmith to a feral and juggernaut combined attack) and that meant I lost all those gun making abilities.
Unless you're on a gather/defend mission, a companion was more of a liability than a help, as they could be overwhelmed if you're near any kind of zed concentration, and then you lose more abilities back at base.  Deaths are permanent, and it adds to the thrill,  but your companions fight to the bitter end, making it hard to pick who COULD die from my roster.  I guess its part of the challenge, but I went solo on ""shoot the bad red thing until it dies"" missions because the hordes coming to stop me would always nail my companion.

I still look forward to a happy and horny SoD part 3.  Days Gone, which is more of what I favor,  DEFINITELY gets the award for best zombie horde mechanics in a game, but SoD2 is does well.",1674517098,1674517098,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is amazing the systems in place to simulate a community fighting for survival against nasty zombies populating the outside.

The zombies feels different enough to keep the experience fresh. The same zombie model, may not behave always the same. Some run, some move sluggish, some jump at you. And there are the specials zombies, like in all zombie games, they have special abilities that you should beware at all times.

Playing in the Nightmare difficulty (one bellow the maximum) on my first run. It begun insanely difficult but immensely rewarding. Every action there is a consequence and often the consequences are permanent. One wrong turn, you can say goodbye to your leveled up survivor and having to bring someone else over to grab back the weapons lost.

It is an amazing sandbox experience in the likes of Mount&Blade, without the world map section.

Everything is made by systems talking to each other. Expect little to no handcrafted stories besides radio chatter giving away lore and context.

I'm just scratching the story part, still, but had a pretty good entertainment for the entry fee and it is a complete game out of the gate.

Co-op with a friend has been very entertaining and funny as well. Besides a few quirks on how the multiplayer is made, I can understand a few things. You'll join your friend as one member of a community you have on your single player part of the game. If your friend joins you, he will be one of the members he has on their single player campaign and he will help your community as an outsider. 

Saddly being an outsider in a co-op, means the base management is only enabled for the host to interact. Every item that's not a rucksack brought by your friend will be deposited on their community unless he drops the item making it a donation.

Overall experience is been a blast and full of adventures.

Making long distance scavenge runs on foot is insanely tense.

Why is it a good sandbox:
You have multiple different options to get resources. If you want to switch things up, you usually have the options or the means to gain access to said options. You don't have to restrict yourself to the same resource milk run over and over again.

Why is it a good zombie game:
Cuz there be zombies, Lots of them. And also bad people.

[h1] The Game [/h1]
Like killing zombies? Establishing a base? Building a community with different characters? Then this is one of the best (almost exclusively single-player) game for you. With customization of difficulty and maps you can tailor the game to suit your own playstyle. Other modes include a more story-driven campaign-map and a horde-survival mode which you can play by yourself or others. 

[h1] The Achievements [/h1]
There are only some harder achievements in the game, some that require coop and some that will take a long time to complete based on grind or even time alone. I can only recommend this game to other fans of these types of games: open-world, some base building, community building and zombie-themed. If you enjoy these games then this game will provide a massive experience to complete. Estimated time to complete: about 250+ hours.

[h1] Recommendation [/h1]
This game provides a massive and very enjoyable experience for the fans of the open-world survival games. I strongly recommend the game on itself and for the achievement hunters I cautiously advise to be aware of the long completion time required to finish the game.",1674158621,1674158647,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game also just constantly crashes at every opportunity it gets, and it being a game made for Windows performs very poorly on Windows, and doesn't support even built-in native Windows features.

It is an open world in one sense but the world isn't that big (there are several maps, you can switch between them in a less than ideal way). 

Your basic objective is to clear all the plague hearts (and I think infestations) on the map. On regular difficulty you just get 2 survivors, some painkillers, some cures and some mines and drive over near it and clear the nearby area then use the mines to blow it up (3 needed; craftable). Clearing infestations can be done by getting any vehicle and using the sirens or horn to attract the zombies outside after which you just drive them all over with the car. Occasionally there is a juggernaut on-site by coincidence so you can't use the car for that (same with bloater).

There are also side events that can happen such as ""mysterious broadcasts"", ""survivor activity"" and so on. Some of these can entail helping someone get revenge on a set of survivors who killed their partners, or someone who left a relative behind that they are looking for. There are also radio requests that can be made that can offer a few options that will feel repetitive over time (I personally stopped using it after some point).

The morale and base building system is pretty basic IMO. Each character can have 0 to 1 special trades (eg gardening, mechanic, utilities) so you can neither replace a person's skill nor can you add a second. The only option you have are to exile or kill the survivor and get another one in it's place since there is a maximum you can have. I did find with some quests it ignored the maximum and allowed me to still recruit more survivors. Even having at least 4 gardeners out of 9 survivors I got very far in the game. Beds are almost always a limitation because you would typically need other facilities at the base. Even with a lack of beds it's not very hard to keep the morale very high if you choose the right facilities and mods.

It is a game you can go back to from time to time, but due to it's repetitiveness you would want to dedicate consecutive gaming sessions to finishing the game.

Note: I did not try the co-op experience. I've read good things but just don't care to try it.

If I reload it reloads to the precise point in time the spawn bug happens cause that's when the game decides to auto save.

Then the plagueheart refuses to show no matter how much snooping over 30 min, try to restart the game to see if it'll appear and assume that in the many loot drop offs, drives, talks to people there'd be an auto save but no, lost 30 min of game play.

When it comes to your AI followers, leave them at home when taking care of serious business (plague hearts, human enemies). They are borderline suicidal and will rush towards their death. Losing a member you may have liked a lot is very gutting, especially when it really isn't your fault.

There are lots of minor annoyances. If the game wasn't so fun it would be death by 1000 cuts. Occasionally your base will be attacked by zombies and there's a little message on screen to tell you so. However, you most likely wont notice it if you are looting or in combat. By the time you do notice, you may have 3 or so minutes to drive all the way back to your base.

It's not a huge deal as you just lose some ammo if you don't make it, but I feel this represents a lot of the problems this game has.

90% of this game is shooting/button-mashing. That doesn't make it a bad game. Obviously plenty of people love it. But I do not enjoy those types of games, and I feel a little misled.
It kept showing up in my Steam recommended list under ""Survival"" and ""Because you enjoyed The Forest, Valheim, etc."", but it is not a survival game or a base builder by any stretch of the imagination.
Playing this game is like playing the ADHD version of Red Dead Redemption or GTA. Popups constantly scroll up, down, and sideways across the screen: ""Visit the wandering merchant"", ""Help the enclave"", ""Hold E to finish an enemy"", ""Mission expired"". It's just endless. There's zero time to catch your breath or wander around.
As for the ""base building"" aspect, that just boils down to choosing which type of room you want to put in an empty space. Again, not a base builder.
The gameplay is a set loop: get supplies, clear zombie spawner, move base to new area, repeat.

+ Skill trees allow for a more dynamic experience in every aspect of going about the day-to-day survival. When leveling up a certain skill, you will receive the option to specialize in another subset of that same skill. To match your playstyle or to add more of a variety, your characters will eventually max-out their cardio and can then specialize in backpacking or acrobatics, for instance, one focused on carrying capacity and the other on reduced stamina drain. 
+ There is a wide variety of weapons to choose from; some of them much sillier or satisfying than others. This option actually impacts your playstyle heavily and can really make the difference in how you set the pace for the game. Bladed weapons can dismember limbs, which is very fun. This comes in handy when you're helping out a friend; just cutting off zombies' legs quickly rather than trying to kill every bit of a horde. In contrast, going the blunt melee route, swathes of enemies will be caught in a single swing and the [i] clunks [/i] feel tremendously satisfying. 
+ Maybe the funniest part of the game has everything to do with the driving. Depending on which seat you're in, you can hold open the doors of your car to slam into every part of a massive crowd. Whenever you enlist a follower, they will automatically do this for you without a word. On top of that, the zombies can latch onto several parts of your car unless you pull some funny business and swing them off by swerving or straight up crashing. 
-+ The multiplayer is.. confusing. It's a neat idea that I've never seen where whoever is visiting the host will pull from their own resources back home to be there. This includes anytime your character gets fatigued or sick; you will have to rely on your own base being up to par and able to sustain some of your people being cycled through and beat up. That's mostly good, however, my main complaint with the multiplayer is that only half the containers will be available to loot. Often times, the biggest difficulty then becomes inventory management for you and your partner. In any case, this completely changes up the experience you have by yourself. 
This game can be played for free with gamepass; but I think the price is still completely fair. Pick this game up with a friend and have a blast helping each other build some pretty unique communities over some vastly different maps. 8/10.",1673849864,1673849864,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

On one hand, on higher difficulties, the moment to moment gameplay is very engaging and challenging. You will lose people if unprepared, or you make too many mistakes, or just get a little too unlucky. While it's fun to play this way, it really sucks for your overall progression. As fun as it is to get stranded far away from your base and try to figure out how to get back alive, as you are doing that, you are getting people hounding you on the radio about helping them, people getting angry at you, you start failing missions and your supplies start to dwindle, ect, as you seem to move in slow motion just trying to get back on track. I really enjoy how challenging the gameplay is on difficulties harder than dread, but it's so hard to play with an end goal in mind.

Now on the other hand, playing on ""dread"" difficulty, one step above normal, the game just felt too easy. Sometimes I could make a bunch of mistakes and lose a person, but other than that the game felt like it was going too smoothly and it barely took any effort to take out a plague heart (the ultimate goal is to destroy all of them) and I felt as if I had beat the game, except that I have to repeat the steps of destroying the plague hearts 20 more times. And once the game starts losing the challenge, the progression and goals really starts to lose appeal.

So...I don't know. It's a decent survival game that reminds me of This War of Mine but in 3d with zombies, which is great, but it just feels like it overstays its welcome and it doesn't try to keep things interesting. In This War of Mine, every night I thought ""man, what is tomorrow going to bring?"" and in State of Decay, I never had reason to think that.There is not enough going to really make it compelling to play after putting it down. However, I think players who don't care about being particularly challenged by a game and have more fun in progressing set goals will enjoy this more.",1673812429,1673812768,False,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

1. Exploring the world is very satisfying, a perfect balance of risk vs reward.
2. Base management that doesn't feel like a chore, rewarding enough to keep you out in the world looking for more stuff. 
3. Fun combat, the combat itself isn't difficult. The difficulty is set before your first swing is swung meaning that things like being prepared, and choosing the parameters of the engagement increase your odds of victory vs twitch shooting and rapid clicking. 
4. Fair number of maps to choose from, you can travel freely between them with your survivor group. 

So what will you be doing here? Simply put, you'll get to recruit a roster of survivors each with their own unique traits which could help with either building stuff, killing stuff, or looting stuff. You'll get to play each one individually as survivors get tired and need time to rest, as you slowly find yourself getting attached to these knuckleheads you will also be on the look out for new locations that you can claim as your base. Each location has a fixed number of facilities that can be created there, some will even have facilities ready to go once you move in. You'll make friends and foes as well, other groups of survivors can become great trade partners or another problem that needs to put down.

Road blocks all over slow down gameplay

Multiplayer
Multiplayer is just down right awful

Host gets better loot
Tether is a joke
No shared progression
Multiplayer just drains materials and ammo for any joined players

Looting
Massive warehouses filled with containers - you can loot 3
Better search every room in this location to make sure it's safe - never a single zombie or enemy NPC inside
Can somehow take 10 seconds to see if there is gas in a jerry can
Can also somehow mess it up and create so much noise zombies pour in on you

Combat
Melee is just spamming left click over and over occasional dodge maybe a kick if you button mash long enough and specialize your skill
Left mouse inputs sometimes doesn't register forcing you to dodge instead of melee
Gunplay is actually decent except for the camera
Choking on gas? You can only dodge
Draw distance is hilarious, how far guns can shoot is even more hilarious

Fetch

AI
Dumb AI ruin your stealth kill or block you in doorways
Blast their guns at everything attracting more zombies
Each character plays exactly the same
Special skill only affect crafting and building facilities

Can't really recommend it, but don't really hate it. Not really my kind of game.

The game has no story, just random quests every now and then. If you had a few hours and can acclimate to a new game reasonably fast, you could beat standard difficulty on your first sitting. 

The gameplay revolves around looting buildings to survive, with no real depth or variation in procedure. You hold down a button to loot, can hold down a second button to loot faster with a chance of making noise. This leads to my biggest issue with this game:

Zombies continually spawn from noise. Even if you cleared out a place before looting, if you make a noise from speed looting zombies will spawn anyway. There is no ""winning the fight for good"" if you take longer than a minute to end each interaction, as the noise of the combat will just spawn up more zombies. This can be incredibly frustrating when fighting a juggernaut or a plague heart; anything which needs noisy weapons. The noise doesn't just attract nearby zombies, it spawns them in. This kind of defeats the purpose of meticulously and stealthily clearing out a place before going loud on the HP sponge. 

There really isn't much else to do besides loot and kill zombies. It got pretty repetitive pretty soon. You can probably eke out a few more hours of playtime by trying to build a great base, but I got burned out before I could reach that point. 

Still, it's an okay game, and I got my money's worth on it. Daybreak is a pretty fun mode.",1673664406,1673664406,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

(played the other sod to death) went back and had to finish off the character that was turned :(
still a bit glitchy but ive got a new comp so graphics and gameplay should be better for me now.
tbh all the SOD series have been very enjoyable even tho if u unlock all the endings on the old game you cant really beat it u can just survive for a long as possible - this version has better replay value as the characters are changed you can play on other peoples games with them which is great as your hard work pays off making heros nice having different leadership qualities to unlock different buildings too, i enjoyed the visit back to turnbull and finsing out how all the sh*t started in the first place- and liked setting up cleo
yes the game does get repetetive after a while but more immersing than the other titles if you like zombies and havent tried any of the games undead labs brought out get this its great!
just reinstalling to see the difference - still ran on my old comp so on ultra graphics i cant wait to delve in again

a few issues I personally have are the follower AI is more brain dead that a labotomy patient and the the first 2 difficulties are boringly easy but the final and newest difficulty is quite literally hell on earth, id say nightmare is the perfect amount of challenging without being excessive.

the absolute worst part of this game tho is driving into a bloater frik those things

Seaching takes forever, but if you use the fast search even in the middle of a completely fucking empty road it has a 33% risk of making noise and then *POOF* spawns zombies right behind you.
Night is really long, it doesn't make much difference, you just can't see fuck all, so have fun running around in darkness 50% of the time.
Switching between ranged and melee is too hard for console gamers, so it's if you aim with right click your weapon turns ranged, and if you just left click without aiming it's melee.
Shit respawns constantly.... Clear a whole area, loot stuff and then drive back to base with your tiny inventory, and once you return 1min later (Because the map is pretty small) there's suddenly zombies back in every room of the house you just cleared.
There's also a lot of random little animation bugs, and the voice acting with strange quiet moments is very cringe to listen to.",1673204212,1673204324,False,6,0,0.525751769542694092,0,True,False,False

Some janky animations - looking at the videos of this game prior to when I bought it - made me think that this game somehow would not be fire. But it is.
It's a surprisingly complex, very good game.

Stealth gameplay in this game is great. Even when shit hits the fan it's still surprisingly great. Community relationships. The fact it appears to be procedurally generated (to a degree) - it's my first playthrough so I don't know for sure but it appears so. Open world (well-made).

Really surprised with this gem.

terrible to see how bugs that destroy your gameplay are still there!
if you play on nightmare any mistake can kill you.
so like bugs...
ANY AI will always aim for you. zombies dont care if there other ai-survivors shooting you. they litterly pass them just to get to you. 

when its dark and you try to kill survivors you dead. its to dark to aim for the head so you will need thousands of ammo to kill ONE survivor. i pumped 61 shotgun shells into one f***** survivor until he died . wtf`?

i know its nightmare . its hard but pls stay realistic. survivor ai stronger then juggernaut lol...

and the bugs............
You wanna clear an infestation? to bad . alot of times the counter stays at one zombie and there is nothing. so you need to go away. maybe wait one day and so the infestation is full again. hoping the bug dont turns up again and repeat the sh*t.

Same with ai-survivor. you on a task doing sh*t. and your npc friend disappers when you come back...
reloading weapons only puttin one bullet into magazin(restart game and its gone).
there are so many bugs i could write a story here.
just annoyin the developers doing shit against it .i mean how old is the game now ? cmoooon.
hopefully SoD 3 is not based on this bullsh+t.

Set in a post-apocalyptic world overrun by the undead, players must gather resources, craft items, and build bases in order to survive against the various dangers that roam the land.

One of the standout features of State of Decay 2 is its immersive gameplay. The game is set in a beautiful, procedurally generated world that players can explore and discover hidden secrets in. The crafting system is also robust, allowing players to create a wide variety of items and structures in order to survive against the dangers of the world.

One of the most enjoyable experiences I had while playing State of Decay 2 was building and managing my own base. The base-building system is deep and satisfying, and it was a joy to see my base grow and thrive as I gathered resources and recruited new survivors. I also enjoyed the game's combat, which is challenging but also very satisfying.

In terms of presentation, State of Decay 2 is solid. The graphics are good, with detailed character models and environments. The sound design is also well-done, with realistic sound effects and atmospheric music.

Overall, State of Decay 2 is a fantastic survival game that offers an immersive gameplay experience. Its open-world environment, beautiful graphics, and robust crafting system make it a must-play for fans of the genre. The game's challenging combat and deep base-building system add to the replay value.

It combines all the elements I could ever want in a zombie game, truthfully, and the game has elements of many different types of games. The community management appeals to people who enjoy those types of games-the combat is reminiscent of Dead Rising, and the weight of your decisions shine through strongly, which would appeal to people for a choice based game. You make your own story, and you truly live in the apocalypse. People in your community DIE, and they will never come back. You hear their yelps and screams, and its visceral. You get attached to your closely knit group, and you have to try to gather new survivors every time one is lost. Your group morale wavers when you lose people as well. If you are too slow in helping someone, you will find their dead body and the character you are playing as will make a sad remark that you were too late, or the potential recruits will simply leave and you wont be able to recruit them.

This Game got insane potential for a great Multiplayer where u can build a base and collect stuff in a challenging Zombie Envoironment with your Friends it would make the Game 100 times better and more fun. I don't understand why it was never implemented.

This game has come a LONG way in fixing a lot of those bugs but there's still places where a car can (without warning and it rarely happens) get flipped up in the air and land on the other side of the county. Only had that happen twice in a lot of play hours but anything is possible with this game.

This game is ""the"" definitive zombie survival game and it's been honed to perfection. Forget the other games, this is the standard and ""7 Days to Die"" runs a close 2nd. This isn't about a single player, it's about a multitude with their own skills and it's as much a sandbox management as exploration or zombie slaying.

WARNING: This game (because of certain bugs) has a major (what i call) ""BSBBS"" (BS Beyond BS) factor where it almost seems like the game will punish you for playing ""too"" well. I think it's the bugs in the game but, sometimes, it feels like the game doesn't want to embarrass it so badly.

Your AI community: To be honest, you would be better off EXTERMINATING them ALL. Why? The game ""expects"" you to help them and, when you don't, they either turn on you or leave. Killing them after getting what you want (out of trade) is WAY better because you don't have to ""persuade"" or earn respect of AIs that have NO gratitude/loyalty unless you give them everything they want ""first"". Personally, i slaughtered anyone who got an attitude with me. I walked in, like a spec ops team, and just head-shot them when they turned (and i don't mean zombie) against you.

It's not about how well you shoot, anyone can do that crap, it's about how well you can kill silently. OR taking on a rogue faction with nothing but a knife and a crossbow when they have guns. It's about making that near impossible shot from half a football field away with a crossbow or a pistol. Or perhaps using a more powerful crossbow and taking out 9 zombies with one well-placed arrow. Yes, i'm talking about THAT good.

The game has many scenarios and I've beat it on several and i'm nowhere near ""the best"" but i'm pretty good. If you can deal with the bugs, until they're fixed, this game is very addictive.


I will say, in Heartland, hearing that dude CONSTANTLY whine about his last group was annoying. I almost got him killed just to shut him up.

Multi-player is a bit crappy, the 2nd player is treated like a 2nd class citizen by the game.

That being said: Don't let ""my"" opinion persuade/dissuade you from playing any game. You and i may have completely different tastes and i'm a 40+ year gaming veteran and some of my opinions are (a bit) ""jaded"" because of years of some bad experiences with some gaming situations.  A ""real"" gamer makes up their own mind and ""never"" lets someone else do it for them.

If you like it, PLAY IT :)

Why i don't allow comments: A review is MY take on the game and no one else's so i don't need other people's critiques turning it into a ""discussion"", otherwise there would be a ""discussion"" button and not a ""review"" button.

It just gives an opening for people (who disagree) to ""snipe"" a person's review and they often snipe in ""ignorance"".",1605301774,1672308300,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros
* 5 maps that offer plenty of looting and scavenging as well as areas that are hidden
* Plenty of missions and optional side missions to keep people busy should they choose to do it
* Difficulty levels are fair depending on which playthrough you want chill/serious
* Higher difficulties make choices/events matter more
* Character traits/skills can help make gameplays easier/harder. Watch who you recruit
* Plenty of base options available 
* Plenty of vehicle options that can be upgraded with the right kit
* Graphics and acting are good
* Two more game modes, one with it's own unique storyline with unique characters and one where you defend an objective as long as you can

Cons
* The game can feel very repetitive with the side missions
* You're communities allies don't search for their own stuff, even when what they want you to get is literally in the area next to them
* Game has an occasional glitch where characters become unreachable on top of objects and you can't complete certain missions
* Lethal mode (highest difficulty) is absolutely unenjoyable. Zombie spawns are terrible in this mode. Seemingly popping up as soon as you clear an area and has times where what you thought was a group of 5 suddenly turns to 50 with freak zombies.
* Human enemies in the higher difficulties are very tanky and in turn leads to massive groups of zombies coming in.


All in all though once you get the hang of the game and know what you're doing the cons can be dealt with.
If you are looking for a challenge while still wanting to have some fun I recommend playing on Nightmare mode.
Lethal mode isn't too bad with the right character skills and game items. It's just time consuming in my cases. Overall I'd give this game an A and recommend it to anyone who wants to play zombie games.",1672278800,1672278800,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- You can Play with friends
- You can shoot zombies
Contra:
- The hitboxes are extremly bad
- You get stuck really easy
- Your base says that they hate it when ther are zombies in the near off your base and wehen you try killing them they instantly respawn.
- Ther is no reset button for vehicles only for players. So if you get your vehicle stuck (wich happens really easy) you have to leave it where it is
- you can destroy some fences and some not (for example: you can detroy concrete fence but some wood fence are f*cking undestroyable

Initially played it last year (free in Xbox Game Pass) and got it again here on Steam (because I can't get enough of it). It's not your typical ""me, myself, and I"" set up where you'll only take care of yourself since you're going to manage a Community of survivors.

Some of the highlights in the game:

• Random survivors to encounter and recruit. And yes, you get to control and gear them up once you have them in your Community. Could be a grindfest for others, but it's actually rewarding once you unlock their Specializations which make them unique. Not to mention the Community and Quirk skills.
• Regardless if you're blowing up heads or dismembering zombies, combat is very satisfying! There are loads of weapons to acquire and to try. Some unique gears can be obtained through bounties, and they are awesome!
• You'll get to enjoy customizing your survivors with outfits, as long as you acquire them. Looting is the key.
• Once you're done with a single playthrough, you can actually choose some of your Community members to be a Legacy Survivor where you can utilize them in a new game.

Cons worth noting:

• Missions could get repetitive.
• AI feels annoying and terrible at times.
• Feels like you're doing a lot to the point where you lose the freedom to explore and absorb the experience.",1672180039,1672180039,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

o Grow from a small home to full fledged multiple bases and one HQ.

o Scavenge resources which is tedious but the more time you spend the more you don't care. At least I didn't.

For me, game doesn't have to be so viscous and tedious. Player needs fun, not this routine. I like idea of the game, but it could be better and fun.

p.s. AI is stupid. You need to do all by your hands. You recruit team members, but they can only stay and look to your character. They can't find resources with you in buildings or anything else. They can only fight (not so good) and they can stay on the homebase and do tasks (if you activate these tasks). I had stupid situation when i recruited 3 new characters far from homebase. They just run to my base through fields and dangerous zombies. But i had a armored car and seats for new characters and can't tell them to sit to my car. They just run and fight with horde and die.

SoD2 a cross platform guaranteed both windows and Xbox players they could play together in the now co-op game, but that didn't work on day one or on day 2 and in fact many days came and went before co-op cross platform would work. The game was immediately entered into the Xbox game pass upon release so anyone could play it without actually having to buy it. There was no date given as to when it would be released on Steam. Undead Labs promised a better game experience, survival experience and fighting experience with several new maps and a new special zombie, they also promised a flare gun that every character would have if they needed assistance if overwhelmed that could be used to call in help. 

When State of Decay released on the 5th June 2013 as a Xbox 360 arcade game it was an immediate hit, It had a story that tugged at the heart strings and characters that the player loved and since permanent death was a thing players did everything within their power to keep these characters alive. Characters consisted of powerhouse's, nimble's and ordinary folk, but they all could do a drop kick, which always knocked down a feral giving the weaker survivors a chance to kill it. There were three types of weapon skills, heavy, blunt and blades all three contained their own skill sets, there was also gun skills for those eagle eyed survivors who with focus aim could kill anything in slow motion. Setting up outposts was imperative for the survival of the base and if placed correctly they gave a zombie free zone because every outpost was trapped which used fuel, sniping zombies from the base watchtower gave a higher ring of safety and there was no cap on how many survivors you could have at the base. Replaying the story was usual and it also helped in getting to know every survivor within the game, knowing them by their clothes you would know if a survivor was a medic, powerhouse, nimble, leader, cook, gardener, researcher etc., characters you needed to survive. As the story progressed everyone in Trumble County was in danger as a new plague had entered the water called black fever and so everyone had to leave Trumble as it was no longer habitable. Eventually Undead Labs gave an update giving us the prequel called Lifeline and the much awaited breakdown with higher levels of difficulty each time the survivors left on a RV. State of Decay also came to Steam, opening the way for a huge fanbase. In 2015 Undead Labs did a complete graphic overhaul and put State of Decay and all the dlc together in State of Decay Year One Survival Edition (YOSE) and Breakdown became more deadly with 99 levels of difficulty, and CLEO drops were added at that point. One update was given to that game. 

I bought the Windows Xbox edition of State of Decay 2, thinking I was entering into a story mode with the two chars I picked, being introduced to the red skinned plague zombie that had no explanation as to where it came from and escaping that camp, wondering what else was to come, I and many other players realised there was no story just a new form of a weird and alien Breakdown, the graphics were bad, the combat was bad and heavy weapons had been removed completely, outposts did nothing, they were only a place to dump non rucksack supplies and where a char could be changed, drop kick was only reserved for certain characters and all the characters were forgettable. Then the plague heart entered which made so sense, it looked alien even though each one had the rib cages of at least three humans wrapped up in it, killing it was as boring as the cleo drops of YOSE and like the cleo drops they used up too many supplies to yield nothing. A cure was also introduced which also made no sense, how could the infected glands of a red zombie cure anyone? It only injected the infection into the character which in time proved not a cure as if again infected another cure was required. Legacy's were introduced which meant nothing as once the so called story was completed you had nothing to go back to, all that hard work was lost as the characters were placed into a legacy pool to use again, it was a boring game of rinse and repeat. 

I bought the dlc Heartland with the hope it would be interesting, it was set in Trumble Country, there are two stories to choose from depending on which two characters you use, but again these stories made no sense, both The Wilkersons and Ray Santos left Trumble County with everyone else at the end of State of Decay 1, so why have them in it? The army had also left Trumble County in SoD1 and only Eric Tann and his men who were abandoned by their superior officer were left to help the survivors and without Eric Tann all the survivors we loved would have died. It seems Undead Labs had forgotten their own story, while telling the OG community that survivors from SoD1 could not be in SoD2 as they could have died in our playthroughs. Trumble County was completely ruined by the red plague seems Undead Labs also forgot black fever, while trying to convince us that cleo an AI had caused the outbreak, every OG player knew the plane crash was the site of the outbreak not cleo that only arrived in 2015 with no explanation given as to why cleo was in the story.

 In March 2020 the Juggernaut Edition was released and was now on Steam to buy, no game passes there, I fell for it again and bought it, with several updates applied since 2018 I rationalised it might be better, it wasn't, it got a little interesting with the Trumble County map as it is the best map in the game, but more was to come, endless updates of moving the goalposts which makes even the regular difficulties more difficult (especially for those new to the game), adding plague territories where plague hearts have dominion that are covered in red fog. Another huge update is on the way, where the plague hearts are now dormant till a screamer wakes them up, where infestations and hordes are spawned from plague hearts, where a siege on the base could result in every survivor dead if the character your playing doesn't get back in time and much more. The game is over four years old and personally I think it is almost at it's alpha stage as the rush release of 2018 was clearly NOT the finished game as much of that release does not exist any more.  I understand updating servers but to completely change the whole game over four years tells me this game was not ready in 2018 and now; even though I have played many hours of it, I'm not interested it at all.

495420,65329770,76561198054309757,0,56,45611,0,3542,1701789633,"Thumbs up or thumbs down? I only play SP, so it could have gone either way as SoD2 is a flawed gem. Why?

Let's start with the BIGGIE - the gameplay 'loop'. There is a sort of iterative pattern players have to go through with most games (grinding, levelling, exploring, building, upgrading etc etc) each cycle through you get tougher, better gear, more options etc. That is true to a degree with gear in this game but the loop in SOD2 for everything is both very shallow and short (pick up some gear - help an enclave - get a person - get a bigger base - repeat). What is worse, do this 5-8 times and you are done, 'end game' - at this point you either start fresh (new game) or move to a new map with a couple of your survivors and....start fresh. In essence, there is no end game, no ultimate goal, you just grind and struggle so you are allowed to reset the grind and struggle (albeit with a leader bonus and 3 experienced characters to start the next map - which is actually a negative because being a small, weak, easily overwhelmed group when you start is the most exciting and fun part of the game. 

Now the quirky stuff:
A tiny country village with a pre-apocalypse population of maybe 100 (going by the houses) has a zombie population of several times that - a zombie count that never decreases for any length of time no matter how many you kill. (this has had a patch to improve it but meh....still endless zombies re-spawning everywhere). 

A 4 door pick-up truck with a flat bed tray has 6 storage slots, each slot can be taken up by as little as 1 item - so your truck may be full if loaded down by 6 pieces of paper (which don't stack). A small backpack also has six slots ,also filled by 6 bits of unstackable paper, but it could also hold 6 fully automatic assault rifles if needed.

Some of the roadside curbs in Spencer's Mill (a town on one of the maps) need you to jump to go from the road to the footpath.

Wear and tear on equipment:A machete only 'works' for about 60 seconds of use, a kitchen knife driven repeatedly into human skulls works forever and ever and ever and ever.

AI is broken, it's just broken, followers refuse to fight (you die) or they refuse to stop fighting and run with you from unwinnable fights (they die). Replacing people in this game is slow, boring, frustrating and just generally painful. Replacing a skilled specialist is...(hmm, I don't have a civilised word for that, insert your own adjective here)

A fortified base designed in the apocalypse to protect survivors from zombie assault has 4 or 5 entry points, each 'blocked' by an unlockable, unreplacable and generally useless flimsy wire gate. Apparently 'fortification' and 'defensibility' are just long, meaningless, complicated words in this game world.

The game has cars. Great !!!! One such car is a Pilato - arguably the best all-round vehicle in the game - it's a mid-sized SUV largely 'comparable' to say a Chevrolet Traverse. Chevrolet tells me the Traverse has a gas tank that holds around 20 gallons (90 litres) of fuel and on highways gets about 26 miles per gallon ( about 9.3 km per litre) so a Traverse has a maximum range of about 520 miles (830 km) per tank. The Pilato has range of about 6-7 km per tank...that's 4.4 miles in the 'old money'. This kinda makes 'Dieselgate' look like a storm in a teacup. 

Heartland DLC, 6 hours into a game on easiest setting, 3 people in my base, just completed first story-line mission and my base was assault by 3 Juggernauts, 2 ferals, 4 screamers, 4 bloaters and what I think was about 30+ regular Zs - WTF is insane difficulty like?

My co-survivors CONSTANTLY complain about too many infestations - even when 90% of them are 2-3 km away on the other side of the map (they virtually reappear as quickly as you clear them) - who gives a s**t, we've got no food, no meds and 2 juggernauts patrolling our neighbourhood and you're worried about half a dozen Zeds setting up house in a ruined garage 3 km away ???!!! Go live somewhere else moron.

Radio: 'Emergency, please help us...we're in trouble.' You get there and there's 3 guys kitted out with machetes and guns standing around in a garage, they ask you (and your companion if you brought one) to go to location X and get them some food. It's the apocalypse, I'm looking for food as well, why should the ONE or TWO of us go into the infested house when you THREE gun-toting dudes won't? Toughen up princesses !!! Call me for help when your base is being overrun by a horde of ferals because you only used wire gates to block the entry points - like we all did apparently.

Missions flood in by radio. And I mean flood. Ignoring them loses you allies and/or damages morale. With your maximum 8 survivors you can only ever use 1 character (with optional companion) to do missions. It is literally impossible to help the whining, princess survivors all around you, clear infestations, deal with endlessly spawning hordes, repair and fuel vehicles, build the base, fix weapons and....so on. It's a shame, you feel like you are being constantly pushed into doing things you have no interest in doing when you really want to explore the map, hoard stuff, or whatever. Even taking the time to checkout the extensive wardrobe options for all the characters makes you feel like an ER doctor who just steps outside in the middle of an Earth-shattering crisis to update his/her Facebook page.

Finally, there is the 'base building' - hmm...copy-paste limited is a good description. Each map has only 5-7 base locations, these are all abandoned houses or commercial properties, each with a set number built-in (and unchangeable) facilities and a number of empty 'plots' which can be used to place a facility of your choice. After a while you get your favourite base locations which you want to use and build the facilities that suit your game play style, end result.....this play through's base looks and actually is identical to the last play through. Both the appearance of the base (survivors never clean out the debris and detritus) and the one-click-to-build process are super unfulfilling.  

There's a lot to like in this game (multiple maps, runs well, really beautiful to look at, good voice acting, atmospheric, solid animations and suitably gooey head splat sounds etc - and it's still getting significant content and gameplay updates which are improving most aspects of the game) but the above issues coupled with other problems (e.g., path finding and collision boxes) mean that for me the auto save dooms you to repeatedly wasting hours and hours of game-play only to have the game hit you with what seems like a stupendous moment from which you can only recover by significantly more hours of grinding (or easier if you are less than say...15 hours in, just start again). Challenging, but not my idea of fun. Nevertheless, having said all that, it's bloody addictive and I am persisting.",1584625366,1671482835,False,365,67,0.904424548149108887,0,True,False,False

Honestly, the AI still sucks in the game. Was expecting a marked improvement, but felt no significant change compared to SoD1. They stand around while a zombie approaches you as you unload cargo, they open doors to zed infested rooms, smack shit at melee range while you want to throw a molotov/pipebomb at a clusterfk.

By the way, a lot of explosives dont have a significant charge timer, so it means that once it leaves your hand, the retarded AI is not going to get out of the way. So it just soaks the damage like a sponge. You can't shove out of a gangbang like SoD1, so if you get surrounded and you don't have a specialization that can shove, you're fked. The game goes trigger happy with zombie spawning so no matter how many times you try to clear an area out, it just fills back up.

The massive downside to the game is that its not ""at your own pace"". More of you are free to gain/lose allies/territory at your own pace. In terms of conveyance, the game is asking you to run around willy-nilly and really slaps methodical players that want to clear an area and then move on progressively. Even when you get a massive base, well stocked armories and roided up survivors, some 3fag half-assed survivors sitting pretty at home will think that they can ""extort"" you for supplies. Thankfully, the game gives you the option to put one between their eyes, which is a welcome change.

BUT, its still one of the best open-world survival scavenge zombie games out there. Pretty much nothing comes close. I played 16 hours in 3 days and still want to play more. So even with all my frustrations with it, I still want to play it. That speaks about the gameplay loop, that even the busy-work tiresome random chores the game devs decided to put in can't seem to tire out my inner squirrel as I scavenge the map and farm up.

Edit: Currently into my 2nd Nightmare Run, and only then does it become apparent that this game has SERIOUS bug issues. Impassable terrain, random freezes, zombies popping in at random, slow render times means you have little to no reaction time to swerve out of the way while driving, bullshit collision formulas, instawrecking cars, cheating AI, HS aimbot enemy humans, and HOLY FUCK TONNES of artificial difficulty. Like GR Wildlands levels of fuckery where enemy humans become fking bulletsponges in a ""realistic sim"".

Like fookin hell mate, if ya gonna crank up the difficulty, at least have your devs play the damn game for extended sessions and you know, actually complete it? So many other issues like ""ghost"" followers, crappy AI, nightmare zone player auto-priority targeting, mass freak spawning and juggernaut spam... I'm sorry but its become abundantly clear that its fking painful to play at times... Eventhough its a good game, I expected more from undead labs to actually bug fix, but apparently small things like the scentmask use bug hasn't even been fixed yet, so I cannot recommend a product that they DO NOT intend to fix.

PermaDeath + Random Bugs = Frustration. I now know why I was pissed, in that you die because of how the game decides to randomly fuck you over things outside your control. Mix in artificial difficulty, and it becomes an issue of textbook game design problems ruining an otherwise stellar product.

Further edit: Changed to do not recommend. Their new updates with the plague territory just feels like ass to play now. Lethal mode just is a bitch to play because the developers seem to love nerfing everything smart players do, to the point you just don't even want to play anymore.",1587590385,1671151282,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The good: Combat can be engaging and intense. Good variety in the items you could use. Item management is great and really forces you to consider your options on what to do next. Graphics are pretty,

The bad: Everything is extremely scripted, from spawning mechanics to quests and a lot of them are so obviously done for game mechanics that they ruin your immersion and even limit what you can do. Just a couple of examples are:

-  Zombies spawning every 50 meters no matter what and have no consideration about where you are. This can lead to them spawning in really weird places. It also makes no sense for a survival game, you'd think you'd meet less zombies by staying away from major town centers but it is pointless. You can go to the most isolated part of the map and you'll meet just as much there as you would in a town because mechanics™.
  
- Human NPCs are inhumanly straight forward and interactions with them are very legalistic. So let's say you meet another group, they try to extort you for stuff and you don't like them and they don't like you. Can you make the first move and travel to their camp and just shoo or shoot them? No, you have to formally reject their offer instead and officially piss them off then wait several real hours till they give you the quest that will let you choose to shoo or shoot them.

All it is is just a game of going into buildings and looting them and occasionally killing a plague heart.  No challenge at all on normal or dread difficulty.  Will end up having a huge abundance of resources which then will disappear when you have to much. Whats the point of scavenging when you don't need anything? That's pretty much the only point to this game. Tried a couple settings on nightmare are where a bit more challenging. But bugs on nightmare or higher make it very hard to impossible to stay alive (maybe just for me). Anytime you go to clear one of the never ending infestations (have to clear them to have good moral) or missions, a horde of 10 zombies come but before you can kill half them them another horde of up to 10 will show. Happens 60% of the time. Another thing that is an issue on nightmare or higher difficulty is the invisible bloaters. Nothing like driving down a clear road and all of a sudden you are struck with the cloud they leave after death. Then after jumping out you get attacked from 5 plague zombies and a horde moving in on you at the same time.

Comments: fairly fun game but I felt like it lacked content in some places, especially when it came to choosing bases rather than building them on your own and the lack of space that even the biggest bases suffered from. Finished the first map in about 18 hours and went to the next one and increased the difficulty but I couldn't have fun cause by then it just felt like a loop of going out, getting materials, coming back. Hope they would give us more stuff to do and base building is a must in the next game.",1670588606,1670588606,True,1,0,0.483516484498977661,0,True,False,False

First glance in to the trailers and some gameplay i thought the combat was boring and clunky, including how the zombies looked, got the game anyway because i needed something to play with friends, ended up liking the game way more than i imagined.

The game on ""normal difficulty"" is pretty easy and relaxing, easy to solo and have a good time. been trying harder settings. Tunning up the difficulty will make the coop experience way more engaging, of course, it will make the game way more challenging and punish you a lot for your mistakes, but team play can be more well explored in this manner. 

the main criticism i have is that the ""coop"" resembles ""dark souls"" in a few ways. 

You're ""summoned"" in to someone else world with a limited range of how far you can be from the host, you cant really create a base in there yourself or even gather resources for yours, but you can help the host gather resources for his base, complete quests and explore. Things like your personal stash is still accessible and you can take or put things away normally, which kinda breaks the coop a bit, because i can get in a begginers game with my fully upgraded character and powerful weapons making the game a bit trivial, which you dont have to if you dont want.

But overall the game is very cool. as every zombie survival game, once you get too much loot or a stable/solid base things will end up calming down, but thats avoidable with difficulty settings and challenging yourself, as always.",1670219003,1670219003,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Also, transferring saves don't always work on Xbox game pass because they LOCK some of them. Avoid at all costs. Any game that makes it impossible to transfer saves is a red flag.

As for the game itself. ITS AMAZING. Gold standard game and I recommend it FULL PRICED to everyone. Not many cheaters, difficulty is highly adjustable, tons of content, tons of fun.

new review 2021-06-21
after some hours I realized the content in game is very very poor, but they keep updating existing boring content without adding anything new and exciting. Unfortunately, the multiplayer mode is badly conceived in my opinion. We want much much bigger maps with 10 or 20 players inside and with massive events involving all players at regular intervals.

Solid game, addition of Lethal difficulty offers a nice challenge and a great bit of opportunity for strategy. Gameplay is fairly smooth, just wish talking to people wasn't on the same key as executing zombies - is a bit disruptive to gameplay when I'm trying to execute a zombie on a teammate.

This game and its predecessor go on sale for their anniversary every year in May. Highly recommend picking it up.

A lot of reviews complain about how the multiplayer is setup but I think a lot of people go into the game with expectations of what the game should be vs. what it actually is and emerge disappointed.

What State of Decay 2 IS:

- INFINITELY Replayable
- You make the story - and the adventure - for yourself, it's not handed to you (with the exception of Trumble Valley Map)
- The multiplayer is setup in a way that allows the host's base to progress. As someone joining another person, you can't make changes to the host's base, but you can use all of their facilities and you earn experience and rewards on the characters you play with other people. It's an anti-grief system setup to protect the integrity of the host's game.
- A game with consequences for your actions, hence the way multiplayer is setup.
- A game that plays more like a dungeon crawl experience that is perpetual and ever-increasing in difficulty.
- Hard as fuck at max difficulty.
- A game that will make you think about your choices a lot, and force you to either get better habits or keep dying.
- A game where you can play solo or with your friends.

What State of Decay 2 IS NOT:

- A base-building game.
- A game where you can be in the same lobby as another person with complete autonomy (you have to be within a certain range of the host).
- It's not for griefers. Seriously if you're gonna join multiplayer and grief other people (throwing zombaits and distractions to get them killed), seriously just go away. It's like DRG. The majority of this community is positive and wants to help, but man, one bad apple can absolutely ruin a run if allowed to run rampant.

Recommend playing with only friends you trust on any difficulty higher than Dread. It's a very punishing experience past that point, and I don't feel like you want your people dying because of random people you don't know :P

I also recommend Green Zone to new players. No one will think less of you. This is the ideal way to figure out all of the game's mechanics, which skills you like to use, how you enjoy playing the game, etc. This is the best place to do that. Starting on Lethal or Nightmare is just going to make you hate the game and get frustrated. Learn what everything does, then increase after that. It'll also let you build up a legacy pool of survivors to use once you're ready to spice things up a bit.

Another multiplayer recommendation... Build up some recruits in your communities before joining other people's games. Or alternatively, just make brand new communities and then you have 9 people you can switch between for minimal effort. This will let you rotate your character more often so you can keep progressing something while you're with the other person. Also recommend taking turns hosting so that everyone can get that experience and learn the game. It's admittedly not the most new player friendly multiplayer system, but it's not a horrible system alltogether. There's a lot of salt over it and I don't think there needs to be. Most of it makes sense, at least from the base progression standpoint. 

The ONLY Thing I Wish They'd Change About Multiplayer: I do think that guests should receive outpost bonuses and base buffs. That's the only thing about the multiplayer I don't agree with at all. Fortunately, it's not that big of a deal in most cases.

In the end, you have to ask what the experience is that Undead Labs wanted to sell people, and that experience was ""An Apocalyptic Survival Simulation"" - It does this EXTREMELY well, despite any perceived shortcomings with multiplayer. There's a lot of adventures you can have alone AND with others if you don't get so hung up on the details.

Haven't played the first one but I can pretty much confidently say that if I assume correctly, this sequel must be much better than the first game, at least as far as I've heard online about the first State of Decay game. I love the graphics, the gameplay, the survival aspect, the strategic aspect that I always wanted to see in a game like this one. I always loved the concept of Clash of Clans and such games on mobile but wanted that same concept implemented into a game where I can control a character manually or control multiple characters. This game, in fact, does just that. It has strategic elements that will keep you thinking about what move to make every second, and will leave you thinking if the move you made was the right call. The only main problem I can see with this game is that none of the choices have any depth to them. For example, when you decide to build a sheltered bed that provides two sleeping beds for your survivors, you just simply build it, you don't need to gather too much material, you don't need to grind hard for any kind of specific material, it's just plain and simple, you choose to build it, grind for ""materials"" which is alone a resource that covers basically all the building supplies you will need. I love the simplification of the features in this game but sometimes, at least a little bit of depth to certain aspects of the game can make the game more interesting, or challenging for some gamers who love challenges.

This game was great on graphic running on UE4 engine, choose to play with friends on coop or solo by choosing 4 different types of leaders to run the communities in gameplay. Killing Zombies never goes wrong by shooting, stealth kill, whack them with heavy or blunt, slice them up or dismember them using blade weapon or ram them by cars.
Zombies will raid or siege base when noise threat is high too. By the help of CLEO, difficulty is much easily to make a stand for new player or even a Lethal difficulty player like me.

DLC: 
Heartland was great one that tell the short backstory of the Plague wall/heart and a little bit more detail of CLEO too.
Daybreak was more like a mini game about Red Talon trying to retrieve CLEO wares to fight back zombies as the detail could be reveal by a character in Heartland. (This is where you earn prestige points for the main game for reinforcement and grinding for the 343 Gulity Spark achievements which need 49 matches of 7 zombie waves, alot of players complained but it was an achievement to honor the Halo Masterchief, so my advice is to grind it slowly, visit your communities monthly for rewards like clothes, guns, rare holiday items and other challenges from a merchant)

This game actually surprised me:
I love the first one and played the story around 4 times and put quite some time into breakdown and lifeline.
After reading about this game I was not really hyped but thought I give it a try. At first it felt only 'ok'.
But playing it for a short time changed my mind.
This game offers a lot of improvements over the first one, mostly concerning the graphics, gameplay, overall stability and performence, and the UI. It's less clunky and overall feels way more smooth.
Because I don't have that much time I just give a summary of what I want to say:
3 hours in it seems that the game has improved in every aspect except for the memorable characters, the map (though I only played on one map so far, so that opinion could change in the future) and the soundtrack, those I liked more in the first game.

*EDIT: I totally forgot to mention that the soundtrack in the first game was better

I've seen this franchise undergo so many changes that it's been a real roller coaster ride. The beta was the original and I remember being hooked on it. There were a lot of bugs, they'd done a bunch of things wrong but the germ of the idea was there and I knew they had something special on their hands. Then came the gold candidate release and things got better. Then came the much needed DLCs to breathe fresh life to an already addicting gameplay loop. Eventually, they remastered it and called it YOSE. And in time, came along SOD 2.

Now back when SOD 2 launched, the whole point of the game was everything that I hated about SOD 1 i.e. The Breakdown DLC. Essentially, SOD 1's BD DLC threw storyline out the window and allowed for a pointless grind with no real end to the game. You just... survive and rinse and repeat. SOD 2 took that idea and ran with it for it's main concept. But, since YOSE, they'd learn a lot of things so the mechanics and graphics were now objectively better. As such, I got the game through my Gamepass and played it on release; got bored like I had anticipated and quit relatively quickly. Over the years, they released some DLC updates, some QoL upgrades, and tonnes of hotfixes and patches that continue to this day. I continue to be super impressed by the level of care and support going into this game, since even at the time of writing, more than 5 years after it's release, we're seeing constant updates for the game. For that alone, I've wished for this game to make it into the nominations for Steam's Labor of Love award category but alas it never makes it. Which is a bummer.

So why HAVE I played the game for 180 hours at this point, you ask. Well, that's an interesting question. You see, years after playing the game on PC Gamepass, I recently noticed that they'd clubbed all the DLCs into a single package, renaming it as ""The Juggernaut Edition"" and sold it as a bundle containing the first game on Steam and as you already know, anyone who owns the first game, usually gets a discount on the bundle. Throw in a sale discount and it was too sweet a deal to pass on. But what REALLY got me interested was how much smoother and content rich the game was this time around when I played it. The Heartland and Homecoming updates, in particular, which added what I always wanted from a SOD sequel - actual stories - was the main selling point for me. Sure, you can go ahead and accuse UL for ""fanservicing"" the OG fans for putting in Trumbull Valley but I think even the newcomers stand to benefit from the addition of actual storylines. Ever since Lifeline, I wanted some real storytelling in the SOD universe which has limitless potential for storytelling whereas the devs just kept on focusing on repetitive gameplay loops for some reason. Don't get me wrong, the loops are good, it's just that at their core they've always been the same and I don't agree with sacrificing the story aspect for them.

However, as I played through the new DLCs, it quickly became clear to me that the devs have completely lost the plot when it comes to storytelling in SOD 2. Compared to the first game, the story in SOD 2 is there for just that- fanservicing. It's short, anti-climactic and raises more questions than it answers about the outbreak. To top it all off, there are a bunch of plot holes in the story and that just boggles my mind. It feels like the writers just can't make heads or tails of what they want to do with the SOD lore. IMO, it's overflowing with potential. Sure, I get that an open-world sandbox where choices matter and permadeath is a thing, stories are hard to linearize and subsequently told. But the plot holes are just too inexcusable for a game of this calibre.

As for the gameplay, like I said, it has surely improved a lot over the years and it just feels like a brand new game compared to what I played 4+ years ago and it's still as addictive but the nature of the beast is such that the grind becomes pointless as you ""git gud"" at the game. That's been SOD games' issue since the beginning and IMO, the devs need to sort this out if they want the franchise to survive. The recent forever communities update is something I'd been wanting for a while but it's implementation is flawed. I never understood them ""concluding"" a community everytime legacy goals were completed and taking the option away from you of continuing with that community to begin with, but even after the update, you can keep your community but they force-reset the map and make you switch maps. I mean... why? I have a self-sufficient community going, I like my friendly enclaves and I want the vehicles where they are. Is it too much to ask when keeping a community? There are still bugs in the game but the modding potential and ongoing official support for this game is [i]chef's kiss[/i] so that's generally not a big issue... until it is, because both Heartland and Homecoming DLCs still have potentially borderline game-breaking issues. Everything else seems fine though.

Finally, this review wouldn't be complete without the mention of the Daybreak DLC. It's this unimaginative repetitive grind of a gamemode that's real unpopular with most players. You're on a ""map"" which is really just a small base with a tech working on something noisy and you gotta protect him from 7 waves of increasingly difficult zombies. That's it. You get some supplies airdropped every few waves but it's the same damn ""map"", same waves, same airdrops every single time so it gets old fast. But, and there's more, they've tied all this to a currency called prestige which allows you to buy some special/cool stuff which is a the real problem here. Daybreak is just bad and forcing us to play it to unlock cool stuff is wrong. Thank god for mods though.

Overall, I'd recommend this game, especially if you own the first and get the bundle on a sale. It's dirt cheap for the amount of content you get and there's enough to keep you interested for a long time if you're into zombie survival games! It has it's flaws but between the official patches rolling out every now and then and an active modding community, you won't have to worry about anything but the post-mastering boredom.

Watched a cute Hispanic chick get DESTROYED by the Juggernaut tonight.
Hid a short distance away, in quiet disbelief, while he broke her in half. Crazy.
Pretty sure I saw a couple other girls join in at one point? Not sure.
Don't think they saw me.
Didn't he invite her for dinner in his bunk tonight, too?
I don't think she's gonna make it, doc.

Granular control over difficulties makes for an accessible experience no matter your skill level. There are some frustrations, which I hope to see addressed in SoD3. But overall this is a must play.

Pros-
--Granular control of difficulties allows you to adjust the game to your own playstyle.
--Balance of game elements keeps things fresh and moving.
--The community mechanic is a one of it's kind that really makes the game stand out.
--Base building is fun, with visual consequence to things, and help elevate the game rather than drag it down
--Crafting is detailed enough to be fun, without so overly complicated I don't want to touch it.
--Community/moral management adds a layer that brings immersion, instead of just adding mechanics for the sake of it

Cons-
--No multiplayer pause. Being able to both agree to a pause so you can take a break without killing the session (and thereby causing quest to temporarily go away) would be great.
--No true multiplayer. While I can have someone come in and ""help"", and we can set some rules to make it feel like""our"" community... the inability for coop players to be permanent community members that add/subtract/benefit/etc... to the base, the moral, the community, etc.. is a HUGE missing gap.

Zombies are everywhere, and I really mean everywhere! Sometimes it's make me wonder that these zombies can breed, because the original number of local population is not this much. No matter how much you slash, smash, and run them over with your family van, they keep coming back... and it's fun!

The only complain I have is the multiplayer mechanic is somewhat too weird. For example, each player will only be able to open their own loot box, which is weird. Sometime, I will run into situation where my team run into the abandon building, and there is no loot box for me, but my friend got like six of them. Then what do I do? I just stand around the corner at wait for my friend to finish looting all those box one by one. It's so annoying and boring and that the game wont around to help my friend to speed thing up.

And another problem is that, only host can manage and interact with building in base, so if I join my friend game, I can't interact with most of the building, I can't craft for my friend, and I can't advice or share my opinion because I didn't see any option on building, I just have to ask my friend to spell it out for me, which is very annoying.

What really got me convinced to buy and play this is when he showed me the scavenging / looting mechanics. How there's so much you can do (search for materials, fuel, weapon, healing items, stamina, repairs), so many things you should consider (forming alliance with other enclaves, choosing the right survivor, leveling up skills, decision making), how you should go about in terms of surviving and killing zoms (melee, guns, crossbow, punching, kicking, explosives, vehicles), and lastly, how to build your base with the essentials and defense you need while keeping the community happy and united (as your community is affected based on the status of your base and environment situation). The game has so much to offer. As a result? It's totally worth every penny.

I love how the difficulty level is very customisable in order to fit your preference. It really helps the player adjust slowly into a more challenging level once they're used to the initial settings they started in.

Solo or co-op, I LOVE this game so much! This is my very first zombie game that I actually enjoyed playing a lot. I know it still has glitches or bugs here and there but it has never deterred me from continuously playing and replaying the game. It's so much fun. I'm very glad that I was convinced to buy this as it had absolutely sparked my interest to play other zombie games at least in co-op style.

The Developers continues to update this game which is great because it shows how they care and hear the community's feedback regarding the work they've done.

I love this game to bits! It has everything I want in a zombie game: resource management, base building, stealth and leveling up your characters. The biggest difference is that you are now dealing with the extremely deadly blood plague and so-called plague hearts.

There is an endless stream of unique characters, each with their own traits and backgrounds that can influence your community's morale positively or negatively. On top of that, you can also customize your character's looks. Also, just like in the previous game, death is permanent! I had my heart broken several times when I lost one of my favorite survivors. I literally feel numb and sour for 30 minutes straight when that happens, lol. The cool thing is that you now have a Legacy Pool which saves up to 50 characters that can be used again in new communities!

Normally, I hate games with time limits and countdowns, but in this game I don't mind at all, because it makes sense. The world is dangerous and chaotic and as much as you want to help everyone, sometimes you just can't. It adds to the drama.

Lastly, I can say that this game has a LOT of replayability. Contrary to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198067384854/recommended/329430/]State of Decay: YOSE[/url], this game has several maps and even more places to build a base. With over 800 hours invested in this game, I STILL get missions with twists or missions I've never had before!

So are you ready to experience action, sweaty palms and emotions? Can you handle a nerve wrecking pursuit by a pack of (blood) ferals, the despondency you feel when you are infected by blood plague and no cure is in sight and the heartbreak you experience when you lose someone in your community you spent hours and hours with? Then get this game. I can't recommend it enough.

Heartland is an amazing addition to this game, especially when you've played the first game. You're going back to Trumbull Valley! I do recommend you play Heartland first before you play the Homecoming map of Trumbull Valley (storywise that makes more sense).

Contrary to the other maps, this is much more story driven. However, none of these characters end up in the Legacy Pool upon completion. It's one and done. Hey, but... dinosaurs. :-P

[b][u]State of Decay 2: Daybreak[/u][/b]
Daybreak is best played online with friends as the NPCs are as useless as a pair of reading glasses on a camel. In Daybreak you play as a Red Talon soldier tasked with protecting a Technician, as he or she is doing technical stuff to some CLEO Relay. The longer you survive, the more points you earn and weapons you unlock that can then also be obtained in the base game. With enough points, you can even recruit some highly skilled Red Talon soldiers into your community.

Personally, I don't like playing online and Daybreak is very repetitive. On the other hand, if you play it a lot and long enough, it does give you a lot of cool stuff.

2022.11.14. edit
Good work on the update, yet there still are some glitches around, like followers will shoot/hit the  zombie if players get to close to them DURING stealth,which WILL BREAK STEALTH.others like at the start-part of some the dirt road, on the road edge, cars  can be stuck and destroyed. During which, cars will shake like hell, it's funny tho. Another funny thing is that NPC equipped with a  grenade launcher can shoot the ground and get concussion and broken ribs when on guard duty, guess it WAS dangerous to play with fire. 
And the game do get bored after several-hundred hours. 
At which time,it basically turn in to a game of collecting things.

With the latest updates, new gameplay features have been introduced into the game and old ones have been updated. Although the game has changed, its goal remains the same.
You need to provide your community with resources by type: medicine, food, materials (resource for building rooms), ammo, fuel. You also need to maintain the morale of the squad, if it is low there is a chance that 1 of your survivors will leave the group.
I definitely recommend!

В ней есть все что хотелось бы видеть в настоящей симуляции зомби апокалипсиса. С последними обновлениями в игру ввели новые геймплейные фишки и обновили старые. Хоть игру и видоизменили, её цель остается той же.
Вам нужно обеспечивать свое сообщество ресурсами по типу: медикаменты, еда, материалы(ресурс для постройки комнат), патроны, топливо. Так же вам нужно поддерживать боевой дух состава, если он будет низок есть шанс что 1 из ваших выживших уйдет из группы.

Loved it, admired it. When playing this one, they changed so much and slapped so much together without proper bug testing that it follows so much of the way of Bethesda and not Cyberpunk. 

So many game breaking bugs and glitches that you can't progress the stories in both the main campain and DLC's which makes it very irritating to play and impossible to progress. Multiplaying with random people who exploit the game with duplication makes it obvious that they aren't even fixing this game. Follower AI is trash and they move themselves right in your line of fire. They are dumb as a bag of rocks and are best used as camels for loot. Fighting hostile civilians is interesting but fails as well. You fight them with melee and can't finish them on the ground or kill them. They just get back up and continue killing you and whatever idiot follower you have.

Freak zombies have been designed to be OP and for whatever reason, some people enjoy it. But that enjoyment for me ends when you get obliterated by a feral and can't defend yourself or even remotely fight back because every time it hits you, it makes you flinch. Again, even with a follower, makes the game seem more terrible. As for other zombies, they have been programmed to be based off of what I like to call ""pre firing."" Zombies hit you before you hit them and have been made to be that way so you have to heal and use consumables. Dodging can be used as an excuse to move out of the way, but if you have a fully developed character, you would expect stamina to follow suite as well. Stamina in this game compared to the first is a joke. There is also a ""soft lock-on"" system that makes fighting very clunky and not very fluid from the first one. And if you accidently hit a button trying to finish a zombie and make amistake, your character goes through this stalling animation until it either ends or a zombie hits you.

Now, what the game did right was visuals and content additions. The graphics look amazing along with the terrain. So much of an improvement than the first one. And the looting system is still in it from the first one which I enjoyed. PLenty of different maps and places to visit. Also, I love the character system they made in the game. So many different personalities and looks that it makes a lot of immersion for the story.

Base building is similar to the first but better. And the ability to have so much customization by having different facilities is awesome. one thing I wished they would have done was made a minigame within each station you build to help speed up the time it takes for a facility to perform an action, but not make it mandatory. Like for example, cooking could have you put different ingredients for a feast, or shooting can make you play a little shooting minigame to build up shooting. 

All in all, this game has a lot of terrible gameplay mechanics, but a lot of great foundation to it. It's terrible they haven't fixed so many bugs with this game as it would negate me not recommending this. Butplaying games you can't progress a story due to game breaking bugs in is not something I will ever recommend anyone to spend money on.

No active eating and drinking mechanics, farming is a passive that requires no planting of crops, medical kits are not a constant juggle between different medicines per type of injury, base building is simple as finding an existing one in the map and securing it. One may argue this game is like a thin soup lacking taste, but the resulting lack of more hardcore mechanics did not turn every gaming session into a 10-hour cycle of mindless menial tasks; and for that, I am grateful for.  

The usual gameplay loop of survival games exist still. Secure a base. Go outside your base, find resources while avoiding or fighting zombies then go back to your base and improve on your equipment. Rinse, repeat. Zombies are varied enough, and can be scary and challenging in higher difficulties.

The core game is simple. Loot, build up a base, take care of your people, and finish the main objectives (or not, your choice). It is done brilliantly, and most of the things I disliked in SoD 1 were fixed or heavily improved.

The only weak link is the looting. Your inventory is not that big (and for a good reason), so looting becomes more like a logistics problem where you have to make sure you can go back to your base or an outpost quickly so you can go back to looting ASAP. I would improve upon the inventory system; for example, little pieces of paper with story content do not have to take up a full inventory slot – make a paper bag or something. 

The game contains two other full modes. One for more story-driven experience with lots of new content and one base-defence with more action and shooting. I love all of them.

Multiplayer could be improved; instead of joining another player's world as a helping hand, it would be nice if two people could merge their worlds and have their bases.

The date is important because many updates have been made to complete this experience.

Do you like,

-free form sandbox experiences

-stabben, shooten, drop-kicken zombie hordes

-lootin'

-self RP and NPC management (think of Rimworld but far less involved)


then you should get this game, and bring a friend if that's your thing.



DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, if you are looking for the following,

-epic and long form story with lots to say about zombies and society

-a rich and wide variety of voice actors (pretty sure MS only gave this team a budget to afford like 4 unique ppl in this whole game)

-super polished red dead levels of canned animations (you know the ones, mounting and dismounting horses super realistically, carving off animal stuff, polishing yer 'gun')





i can't really say this game is an extension of the first one, nor is it really it's own game. MS clearly rushed the inital release out, but they have allowed at least some of the team to remain dedicated to providing free updates to the game that fix many things that were unfinished or just missing when it first launched.

If this game had another two years in the oven and were only releasing now, with even more polish and all the content they probably wanted to, it would be a very different value proposition.

But they didn't and you can blame MS for taking the easy way as they have done in the past, of acquiring small studios, pushing them to their limit and releasing their games far before they are ready.

This really reminds me of Crackdown, the first was a cult classic and ppl loved it, the second was also very fun and more of the first, but not really enough on it's own to justify being a whole game release. MS seems to be operating under the old way of doing things that every single major update to a game has to be it's own release and there is a lot more work that goes into that than simply releasing an expansion.(and also a lot more price tag, which is probably the real reason they do this)

But I digress, the game is fun, just don't expect anything super deep, there are plenty of zombie games in the works from indie devs that will scratch that itch. And even maybe big triple a studios will get back in on the zombie action with movies and shows gaining worldwide popularity. (no not walking dead trash that has nothing to say about anything)

Controls are needlessly poor. Especially noticeable when driving. You have one speed, and that's full throttle which just doesn't jill for a game where you need to be careful, where cars are fragile and requires fuel. Often you will find yourself crashing into things or failing to simply reverse because your character wants to be a hardcore stunt driver at any cost.
Same goes for on foot when there's needless duplication use for the buttons. Picking up an item, searching a container, executig a zombie and open/close door is the same button. This is especially frustrating when you are in a stressful combat. Instead of killing the zombie you just put down, your character calmly turns their back on the zombies to close the door...
The interface for talking with NPCs is also frustrating as it takes a bit to load and the answers seems to jump around. Twice now I have ended up accidentally threatening a friendly faction when I simply wanted to trade with them. This is especially frustrating in a game where allies are hard to make and they can be made bitter enemies with a single wrong click.

Lastly the game crashes. A lot, like once every 2 hours of play.

Even with all those terrible bugs/design choices, I still enjoy the game though and can recommend it. Just be prepared to be very frustrated at times.",1667337046,1667337046,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Here is the basic loop to the game: select a survivor and a follower->grab vehicle->head out to objective or loot area->fill your inventory WAY too quickly->head back to deposit resources->craft/upgrade base. Repeat.

Exploration is killed because you can't stay in the world very long because you can only carry a dozen items. Instead of making meaningful choices on what to take and what to leave behind, it's faster to make multiple trips in the vehicles and just horde everything you find. The inventory system is uninspired; your character has some pockets and the size of backpack you have determines how many slots you can carry. The problem is that, while items have weight, they have no size determination. I can carry a full exercise bike in one slot, or one small knife. You can see the problem with this. 

Your base feels restrictive and annoying, rather than safe or liberating. Base areas will have a select amount of slots that fall into 4 categories: large/small, outside/inside. You aren't exactly building a base so much as deciding which resources you want to have access to. Once you build a facility, you gain +1 food, or fuel, or meds, etc. Even a sizable base will feel too small. Beds are always a problem even if you take a Builder as a leader - beds essentially equals how many survivors you can house. The game artificially restricts you in order to funnel you into a grind. This is NOT a free building game. You can't even create better defenses like sandbags or parking vehicles together for road blocks, you just have to suffer repeated zombie attacks and there's nothing you can do about it. I constantly had 4-5 specials and a couple hordes around my base. As soon as you clear them out, you'll do one mission and zombies will be swarming your base again. If you have a watchtower, your NPCs are always shooting at zombies which makes noise and gets extremely annoying. Imagine constant gunfire in the background when you go back to your ""safe haven.""

Your characters' attributes don't feel unique from one survivor to the next. You unlock some handy fighting abilities like quick-snap targeting, but if a character is good at mechanics for example, they don't need to be the selected character in order to repair vehicles or craft repair kits. Simply having one character with the mechanic skill will allow all characters to use the autoshop to craft auto related items. It's convenient, sure, but does nothing to make you feel connected with your survivors. In short, it doesn't really matter who you play as at any given time, it only matters which attributes you have as a collective. 

All survivors run at the same speed and carry the same amount of loot aside from upgrading their skills. There is no uniqueness here. Even shooting and fighting with a ZERO skill character is not hard and you won't feel much difference between a zero skill and a 5+ skill. 

Leveling skills is way too easy and way too fast. Everytime I selected a new character I had a skill to upgrade. It doesn't feel like you work for it and you level up so fast it feels like an inconvenience rather than something to celebrate or look forward to. Oh, reading 3 books on a subject will make you an instant 5+ expert lol. 

Survivors will say the same damn thing, over and over, when selected. Literally they all have one line of dialogue, and you get to listen to it a lot because you have to select them in order to give your follower items out of your inventory. 

The menus are janky beyond belief. You can't rearrange items in your inventory, you can't remap your controls on MKB, you can't view all survivors in a list with a list of available attributes, the game won't tell you how many of a craftable resource you have (like chemicals, ethanol, etc.) when you are crafting, you have to cycle through every usable item in your inventory in order to ""throw"" or ""use"" it, sheesh, the list goes on. You will feel like you are fighting the HUD and menu at every step. Min/Maxers will instantly hate this system. 

If you like mindless grinds, basic combat and the occasional cinematic camera zoom when beheading zombies, you might like this game. This game isn't punishing and it's the opposite of realistic -- I navigated the map by driving full speed in rivers, because there were less obstacles than the roads. lol.

The short of it is: if you're looking for a fun solo or co-op open world zombie game, this is one to consider. Read below to get an idea of the game.

State of Decay 2 in so many words is a zombie survival, third person combat game. It features a huge and expanding arsenal of recognizable firearms and melee weapons such as the Glock 17 9mm and Crowbar but also had unexpected things the more savvy would recognize such as KSG shotgun or APC9 submachinegun.

I had a few issues with the game in the form of performance. Often when the game cloud-saves, it would freeze my screen for a moment and this was bad for a game like this where zombies are charging me. Gameplay-wise, zombies could occasionally counter my attempts at takedowns with ridiculous reaction speed (I.E. takedown starts and fails because the zombie instantly changes direction to face me) that would cause me to take damage. Some game elements are unclear. When I started, I was unaware that completing a community's story would end that community and they were lost forever. This was luckily changed recently but it still forces you to move to a new area. Weird choices but overall a great experience.

The game caters to a wide array of playstyles and skill levels. You can independently choose how difficult combat is like how much damage zombies dish out and take, how generous or rare loot can be, and how difficult or easy it is to run your survivor community. (I play on Lethal zombies, Green map, and Green community, so combat is always a challenge but the rewards are also great and my community isn't too hard to run for me.)

The game world feels full of stuff to do. You assign a leader to your group and, depending on the character, they can become a type of leader and that dictates the sort of attitude your community has to the world. This is very customizable, too, because even though you are given the choice of two characters who then get two more in the tutorial, you can completely trade out anyone. Often you'll be visited by someone wanting to join your community and you can say yes or no. You can dress up your survivors, give them weapons, you can even recruit one to follow you if you're lonely and they have unlimited ammo as an AI. You could be driving on a supply run and get a call on the radio to go help a neighbor but you don't HAVE to, though they might die forever or turn into a hostile group. Bandits might move into town.

One of the big gameplay elements is how you layout your home. Where you make your home matters and there are different ways to lay it out based on what you need and want. You might not need to find a power source because your home has power built-in.

The big core combat challenge is clearing the ""Blood Plague"" from the area. Several spots on the map will be super dangerous to go to because blood plague kills quickly and makes zombies stronger. It's a decent challenge and incredibly cinematic the way it plays out clearing them. Oh and also this game does perma-death so if you lose a character, they are gone and that adds to the tension greatly. On Lethal combat difficulty, I was always cautious but it never felt like I died instantly. This is a play smarter not harder game.

Give it a try and if it's on sale, maybe bring some friends.",1666923347,1666927222,True,61,0,0.84112626314163208,0,True,False,False

 I really like everything about this game!  
Game play and interaction to everything perfect and building system very good but the map should zoom out every time you open it and what we get is this pain in the @@@ issue having to zoom out ever time we open it.  This should be fixed! 
So why the thumbs down!
  The game play size issue is what upsets me if you have cleared the map of all the blood plagues in one area you should be able to go out on your own and start over with a whole new team and not have to drag along all the others this feels fake and it acts as if you are starting over a whole new game.  In what world do you do this.  So all the rest of the map is just continued play for just a start over point and is pointless to leave the area once you cleared the plagues out so you should just end the game by doing the leaders final quest.

It took me three bases before my survivors became somewhat self-reliant, but before that it was just me and my follower looking for scraps to drive home and sustain my base with. And when I mean scraps I really mean scraps, because even with your own inventory, that of your ally, and the one of your car, you can never carry everything you want with you. And that's on standard difficulty, can't imagine how it would be on the higher difficulties.

The zombies didn't prove much of a problem once I got all my survivors some guns and cars. Though I think with every day passing the difficulty goes up. Suddenly Bloaters started chilling on my roads, making perfect mines for my cars. Ferals left and right started pulling off my doors, pulling me out, and dodging my shots and melee attacks. Juggernauts coming up at the WORST possible time when I have 0 ammo left after clearing out Plague hearts. After day 11 it felt like my base was constantly on the verge of being run over. It's not like the zombies themselves are very difficult, but it does feel like you have to be prepared or you'll lose a survivor, thus adding to the feeling of being a scavenger. Never underestimate them.

I love the community system. I only started two communities so far, but their experience has been intensely different. The leader of the first community was a hothead Mexican guy who turned out into a warlord, making the game about us vs. the others. The second community leader hasn't been picked yet, but it seems like trading is becoming more of the standard. I only wish the personal goals were different, since most of the personal missions I have in the second run, I've already had in the first run.

Talking about missions, it's the only thing I'm in the middle about. You are constantly being spammed with people needing help, or survivors wanting to do something. Together with the scavenging and trying to clear the map of Plague hearts, there's just not enough time. And because I don't do the personal missions, the morale of my people goes down. It feels annoying, but I guess it makes sense from a scavenger perspective as well. Even time is limited, and you have to make choices.

All in all, it's a really fun game so far, and I haven't even touched the DLCs yet. I really want to try coop, but being tethered to the OP and not being able to develop your own surivors in another person's map just seems odd to me.

The devs are continually improving the game experience and, this is rare, listening to player feedback when deciding which areas of the game to improve. AND THEY DON'T CHARGE FOR IT!

With that being said now comes the negatives. I feel that being the second game in the series, the creators could have improved in areas such as the types of monsters to encounter as there wasn't really anything new in that department. 

I think that story could have been developed more and leaves much room for improvement, i.e. at the end of the first game the creators made it out like once you broke out of town that had been cut off from the rest of the world that we were going to possibly see how the rest of the world had fallen. 

Weapons could have vastly improved upon especially with the military, throw super advance weapons in there somewhere even a laser gun or two. Multiplayer aspect could/should have been where players could enter other players world and towns. With updates it would have been nice if the developers added new missions to progress the story further.

Overall I give this game a 7.5 out 10. Hopefully the developers work on a better story should there be a third instalment.",1666095234,1666095234,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

My advice to anyone playing, would be to play the game on Dread and above for every slider. This isn't for the sake of stroking your e-peen, more so because I feel any difficulty below truly trivialises the experience, to the point where you'd may as well be playing Dead Rising.

Not a fan of the bounty system and having things on rotation, it's a weak and cheap way to encourage player retention on the basis of FOMO. Sure, the game doesn't have a store and isn't littered with MTX, but FOMO regardless of where I see it will forever do my nut in.

Co-op is solid. Dealing with a tether is never nice but it's usually pretty fair. I don't understand however why there is no option to unlock all loot containers for your party. Having a coloured loot allocation works for random play, meaning people don't just hop in and jack your stuff, only to dip, but if playing with your SO, mates, family, why can't I turn that off and let them go nuts? It adds unnecessary mini-micro-management of locations, requiring everyone to enter every building when one person could effectively loot all on their own.

So I would assume that, like me, most of you enjoy playing ""The Sims"" from time to time, and some of you like to build your Sims a swimming pool after which you proceed to dismantle the pool ladder once enough Sims are swimming, thus trapping them and ultimately killing them.

And again, like me, I presume you crack a cold one, sit back, relax and let nature take its course. Or maybe you enjoy the finer things since ""The Sims"" does offer a plethora of ways to mess with and inevitably kill Sims for your own pleasure.

[b]Long story short[/b] - I know that there are a lot of psychos like me out there, but this review is for everyone. ""Normal"" or not.


Now then, that having been said, imagine this. You have one or maybe multiple strangers or even allies that you're maybe not that fond of for different reasons. Maybe you even hate them. Maybe they have outlived their usefulness or are just a constant burden. Maybe they're annoying as hell. Don't know, don't care, won't judge.

So what then? Well, transfer your Sims approach here, but this time, experience the downfall of whomever you don't like in the glory of a third person camera as you either infect people and watch them turn only to be killed by their own friends or by you, either using blunt or sharp instruments, or perhaps courtesy of a bullet from a Revolver the size of a cannon right between the eyes, blow 'em up, set 'em on fire, direct hordes of zombies towards them, drive them and leave them next to a Juggernaut which will literally rip them in half. I mean, trust me - the sky's the limit in terms of what you can do to people and how you decide to savor it.


As for the overall game in terms of graphics, mechanics, sound, story, modes and whatnot, well, not gonna lie, it's a really solid experience overall.

Edit: Here are my thoughts on what I want from State of Decay 3 

Multiplayer - Hopefully state of decay 3 will improve on multiplayer no longer limiting your friend to only a certain area before being tethered and hopefully they'll make the game fully offline never needing internet in the first place. 4 player co-op would be amazing too

Map - I would also love a far bigger and better map something similar to the size of gta 5s map and then add more with updates make zombies and infections more threatening to justify this combined with a far larger map with more to do and more base options would be amazing then other maps that are unique but the same size or bigger would make far more interesting content and enjoy-ability in this game. allow an option for the game to progressively get harder the longer you stay on a map. ADD A WEATHER SYSTEM in SOD 3 please for atmosphere and also add a option to increase view distance  

 Base - I want to see a more improved and intractable base building system with more things to do or help out with inside your base. I would also like a base expansion system allowing you to make bases bigger and better if you meet the required amount of survivors and resources needed you can also allow us to add onto outpost such as and upgrade system beyond tier 3 that allow you to build things such as a generator or watch tower and assign survivors to stay there and manage it expanding the options we have (this should be a harder and more tedious system more end game based)

3rd person - Make 3rd person more fluid and smooth feeling along with gun combat. add more interesting zombies and an option for you to fight against and making the game a more horror styled experience 

Communities - Allow us to have a bigger community cap also allow other communities to expand their bases and threaten us and others for supplies making them a real threat and make survivors from those communities and others into a random event while scavenging  I.E you enter a building see nothing to loot begin looking through the building and meet said survivor who attempts to kill you for being an enemy or allow us to threaten or kill them for loot or they do the same to us. Same goes for other communities allow us to use the friendly system in a way where we can be a threat to every community and they work together to attack our base and attempt to execute our leader for their crimes or whatever survivors in our community who have the highest infamy. This allows a more interesting villain or hero system that has consequences for our actions.

TL:DR 
I'm going to pre-order State of Decay 3 the second I can and I'm not in the slightest concerned that it'll disappoint me although I do have ideas that in my head if done right could improve the games core and allow a more in depth community and base system which will add more replay-ability and an even more dedicated player base so I listed them read or not the games good I 100% recommend it to anyone who loves zombie games",1664346039,1664784936,True,0,0,0.473395347595214844,0,True,False,False
495420,123243573,76561197996370043,0,45,462,0,462,1664734849,"Pros:
- A light GTA with zombies.
- Fun music and gameplay
- Addons to buildings being scavengable  is a neat idea.
- Places, once cleared, not producing zombies is a great idea.
- Infections slowly spreading is neat.
- Outposts idea is good.
- Interactions with and existance of enclaves is a good idea.

Cons:
- I dislike that you need to move constantly to throw in extra shitty beds. There is space but you can only build in designated zones.
- Having only a single person to follow you unless you cheese the game with side quests sucks. Plague hearts would be easier with extra hands but no.
- Most games with magic zombie/enemy appearance is not cool. Once you clear an area, new zombies should only come from uncleared areas and spread around if left unchecked. You should be able to basically push them back. What happens is you go to a plague heart, clear the area around it before attacking, your base 300ms away calls for help, you go fix that and come back in 2 minutes total to find the previously cleared area overrun again. You clear a wide area again, hit the plague heart and immediately new magic zombies by the 10s appear right on your face.
- The cars are paper thin and this is done on purpose because it's actually fun and relatively easy to clear masses of enemies with it. Not cool.
-  All cars have 6 spots at the back. It doesn't matter if you put a single bolt or a massive bag with building materials lol.
- The companion AI is weird. My dude dissappears for a while right near plague hearts sometimes and tells me to wait for him lol. Also, I escape to the roof thinking we might live but my dude goes down the ladder to fight 20+ plague zombies alone. Sometimes goes right into the room with it to fight things while I'm chucking bombs.
- The tutorial is lacking. It doesn't tell you that the plague heart is not in places marked with the symbol but has its own thing somewhere else. It doesn't tell you it's not destroyable by melee hitting. It tricks you into spending influence points on a meaningless ammo dump. It never tells you you can't aim grenades but they just get chucked.
- Outposts idea is great but HOW do outposts generate resources, there is noone there? Instead of limiting my command center level, it should have been by the number of survivors we assign. Lvl1 should have been run by 1 dude, level 2 by 2, level 3 by 2 + power etc. If you have the manpower, you could get whatever resource you wanted. But now, we are limited to magic things appearing.
- Before I understood that I HAD TO do the main questline, I came across some mindlessly running around people in a house who didn't interact with me at all. They just ran around in a house near a plague heart. Later on, after the questline proceeded they interacted but what for. The game tricks you here again to recruit them while you think you can prob build more beds in the available space around but No. For some reason, you cannot. Apparently you have to pick and choose your peeps but that's allright because the game expects you to replay after your first learning playthrough. After all, why would you recruit useless people if you knew what was happening right?
- There is a supply limit of 20 unless you do upgrades. I had the bikergang place and there were empty spaces all around but no. 20 it is. Also you can't place shitty wooden beds around LOL
- Apparently in this game, guns without silencers are a no no. When you fire a rifle in an empty place, even a mountain, you suddenly get 20-30 dudes running at you. This is way worse in a plague heart location.
- Everytime I see zombie movies/games with sound being used as a distraction mechanism. I always wonder WHY can we not build a 3-4 meter deep hole, add some gasoline at the bottom, dangle the music thing at the top of it and just wait to light it up after enough has fallen. After the initial light up, the fire would prob go perpetually until the area clears itself.


TL;DR; After seeing all the positive reviews, I feel cheated out of my money. No base building, so far no story, 0 meaningful interaction with other survivors. Weird game mechanics all around. I had way more fun with a similar (loosely) game called `Days Gone` than this. It's just consuming time without giving aything back.

On paper, this sounds like a fantastic time - coop zombie smashing with some resource gathering and base building mechanics in an open world? Sign me up! The execution, however, is sorely lacking, beginning with...

...Getting into multiplayer. It's... it's awful. It uses the old Xbox multiplayer service thing and it's clunky as all hell, bordering on broken. It took me an hour to get this thing working, and when I finally did, I learned that progress only counts for the host. So that's... pretty bad, and ruins the potential that lies within a game like this. Logically, you'd think it'd be fun - you and a friend level up your characters, upgrade the base, etc. But your friend is going to be stuck using whatever underdeveloped character they have in *their* campaign and won't be able to progress... at all. They also can't perform core actions, like building said base, or like... using certain functions like the medical system. Baffling decisions were made here.

In short, the multiplayer sucks, and needlessly so.

How's the singleplayer? It's fine! It is... an open world zombie game. You love it, or you get bored and move on. It doesn't help that none of the systems within SoD 2 truly stand out on their own - middling combat, an okay open world, mediocre character customization... As much as I hate putting numbers on these things, It is the definition of a 6/10 game.

So - is this worth playing? Maybe if you LOVE zombies, but even then, you're probably already playing something better.

I've had survivors randomly die off screen at home. You had a survivor catch blood plague while base defending and die within 10 seconds - didn't have time to realise and switch him into the infirmary.
Survivors sometimes decide to crash an objective full of zombies.
Bodies disappearing with valuable gear.

State of Decay 2 bucks that trend for the better. It is a zombie survival game but the focus is on building your community. You don't have to lone wolf if, but you can recruit fellow survivors to help you build a sustainable community. Most of the NPCs tend to be neutral or friendly with the occasional violent human NPC.

The focus of the game is finding resources for your developing community. You also have to juggle morale, safety and survivor needs and this be accomplished through trading or scavenging incentivizing  the player to form alliances with other enclaves to trade with.

The combat is fun. Ranged combat has a variety of fun weapons, but the melee is done really well. It is satisfying to take down a bug juggernaut zombie with a cool killing blow animation.

The multiplayer allows a friend to join in on the fights and that's about it. A glorified AI.

i wanted so hard to like Zomboid but i don't know if it was the overwhelming amount of things or the perspective or the controls, but it quickly lost my focus. an hour or two into SoD2 i realized that it's a more streamlined kind of experience than PZ, and i fell in love. i am actually inspired to give PZ another shot once i exhaust SoD2 :)

anyway, i really enjoyed the many systems at work here. i'm the kind of gamer who feels like he has to do *everything* -- i burnt myself out of Skyrim because i wanted to visit ALL the tombs, e.g,. in State of Decay 2, that's not really feasible. *technically* you could do it, but between the zombie threat, the timed missions*, taking care of everyone, and especially inventory management, there's not really time or need to do that. i like when a game can break me out of my habits!

sound is great, voice acting leaves a little to be desired but i didn't find it to be too distracting. graphics are terrific, and i'm able to max everything on my 2070. there are improvements to be made with the UI but it does a good job of not getting in my way.

as far as difficulty, i feel capable of tackling any challenge, but not so capable that nothing is a threat. i would say any threat so far is manageable because i've been hoarding. there've definitely been some OH SHIT moments though -- usually related to unexpected hordes of plague zeds. i'm playing on normal difficulty, which at the start was perfect but i may increase it soon.

There are all kinds of great zombie survival games out there, but usually they focus on only a few things. State of Decay 2 doesn't do that. It has a little bit of everything. Which, incidentally, is the reason I love this game so much.

If you like base building mechanics, it has those. If you like resource management, it has that. If you like RPG elements like skills and traits, it has those as well. It also has zombies, but I figure that's probably not too much of a surprise. It also has multiplayer, a horde defense mode, and a mini story mode as well.

The only real issues I have with the game are with the AI and the maps. The AI can be a bit dumb and frustrating at times, but isn't too bad overall. The maps are fine for the most part, but you will occasionally encounter an invisible bump while driving around, sending you tumbling. Oh, and the Devs gave hostile NPC's hacks on the harder difficulties. Those darn cheaters!

Gameplay-
☐ Very good
☑ Good
☐ Nothing special
☐ Okay
☐ Bad

The gameplay is improved from the first State of Decay, while still keeping the core game mechanics. This game has more to offer than the last game in terms of of gameplay features, but it still feels very much like a State of Decay game. There are more maps, more things to build, more zombies, and a lot more cool features that make you go ""oh! that's new!"".

For the average player of games, this game can get tedious after a while (as do most games). But with multiple maps to explore and heaps of new base locations, if you get bored you can just move somewhere new and check out new locations. Of course, after a while this gets boring too. Although State of Decay 2 does get tedious, it has hours and hours of gameplay that is worth experiencing and a bunch of new features that distinguish it from the previous game.

Graphics-
☐ Masterpiece
☐ Beautiful
☑ Good
☐ Will do
☐ Bad
☐ Awful

The State of Decay franchise has never been known for it's graphics and/or visuals, but it doesn't fall short really. I've never played this game and thought it looked horrible, nor have I played it and thought it looked amazing. The graphics are what they are, nothing special, and I'm okay with that. 


Audio
☐ Amazing
☐ Very good
☑ Good
☐ Decent
☐ Not too bad
☐ Bad

The sound affects in this game can be quite comical at times, but it goes with the theme of this game, its graphics and its play-style. The sound of the zombies are great and interesting, but not very scary (I'm not sure if it is supposed to be that way?), the voice lines are really impressive and immersive, and the SFX of the world is nothing special, but it all works well together.


Story-
☐ Lovely
☐ Good
☐ Average
☑ Not great
☐ None

For this I decided to put 'Not Great' because I'm not too sure if there is a story at all, perhaps a hint of a story. If you can class 'there's a zombie outbreak and we have to survive' as a story, then this game has a lovely story. However, comparing the survivors stories to the previous game, there is no introductory scene or explanation as to what happened. All we can do is guess that this is the same outbreak from the previous instalment. 


Difficulty-
☐ Just press a bunch of buttons
☐ Easy
☐ Significant brain usage
☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master
☐ Not so easy
☑ Difficult
☐ Dark Souls

This one depends on the difficulty that you play at. I play on the average difficulty and so far only one of my survivors have died, so it is enjoyable but only slightly challenging. However, bumping this up one difficulty, I really struggled to do anything! There were barely any guns/weapons out there and I was being sent on rescue missions in a town plagued with zombies. It seems to jump up in difficulty quite a lot, so I decided not even try the hardest.


Grind-
☐ Nothing
☐ Only if you care about leaderboards/ranks
☐ Isnt necessary to progress
☑ A bit grindy sometimes
☐ Average grind level
☐ Too much grind
☐ Insanity

Again, this all depends on your difficulty preference. Playing on average, I had to grind quite a bit for supplies to keep my base running and my survivors fed. Both looking for supplies and finding weapons are about the only things you will grind for, unless you find the quests grindy too.


Price
☐ Just buy it
☐ Worth the price
☑ Wait for sale
☐ Maybe if you have some spare money left
☐ Not recommended

This game is ALWAYS on sale! So if it ain't on sale at the time of you reading this, just wait.. because a sale is coming. I wouldn't recommend buying this at full price as I don't think it is worth that much, but I don't think some people would be let down by it if paying full price.

I won’t speak more introduction, what players care about is the gameplay, right?

Expert game reviewer will speak about the pictures and sound&background musics, the story etc, but I only speak about the gameplay, because I’m only interested on the gameplay so I apology.
Now I first the villain then the gentleman, talk about the defects.

Defects:

1. Zombies respawn too fast.

Almost every time players left the area and return to the place from another area, those zombies that killed by them reset and even re-appeared zombie hordes and freaks.

2. Limited loot-able resources in every maps.

It’s not like other open world games, all loot-able items in all maps in the game set to unable respawn, even though maps in the game are large map, there has many places and buildings can be loot by players, but still it’s limited, one day players will looted all contains in the map. Only about time.

fortunately there has the main quest in the game, if players can finish it before spent all the resources then their survived characters can be saved in the community.

3. NPC’s AI is too stupid.

Every time they saw zombies in the sight, they always rush to attack them without any hesitate, even what they saw was zombie horde with freaks. If it’s no car nearby the player, and the player decided to run away, these NPC companies won’t follow the player and stayed to fight until slaughtered by them.(They only forced follow the player when the player enter a car)

And the best way to break through the situation is to throw firecrackers then throw grenades on those zombies what gathered by firecrackers. But these AI companies never trying to avoid those grenades, they always stayed in the blast area and attack zombies until knocked down by the explosion. This is very non reasonable and players tactic will seriously hampered by their stupid actions.

The worse point is when the player tried to sneak attack zombies in the infected zone, sometimes NPC companies jumped through the window in the house and attack zombies first before you do anything, they often bugger something up and made things more difficult.

And when the player stepped into a house who trying to loot some stuffs, AI companions sometimes will also jumped into the house and broke the window, it seems they fear zombies didn’t notice the player was inside the house. Is NPCs too stupid or just the developer of their AI is lack of intelligence?

Otherwise, AI companies sometimes kept idle until got claw or got bitten, even zombies came from their front. And of course when the player got bite, their idle won’t stop(they only made fighting stance without any action). This is inexplicable design.

In the last, AI companions often open the home site’s door and rush to zombies when the home site under siege, abandoned their benefit defense position. Even idiot know that zombies entered the home site the battle will very easy become out control.
And AI companions guarded on the tower in the home site, sometimes will come down to fight zombies in home site siege event, it’s really too stupid.
I suggest Undead Lab to refer the classic nuclear war apocalypse game “Fallout”, allow players to order their AI companions to change their stance to enemies like “aggressive”, “passive”, “never attack”, and allow players to order them “stand here(guard here)” or “follow me” etc.

4. It still has many bugs remained in the game even passed 2 years on the market.

For example, the player character randomly stuck(this often happened when the player opened a locker or container), unless he/she jumped or he/she cannot move.

For example, when the host player driven the car away client players and each client player entered other cars, then their cars will teleport to the host player’s location then explode, because their cars will reduplicated in the same place and crash to explode(and their characters will dying)!

For example, one player is fixing his/her car, another player stand near him/her, when the player done the fixing then the player stand near him/her sometimes will blasted to another street by nothing, and the player character will dying for that(in a few of rate).

For example, the player cannot talk to his/her AI companion(so he/she cannot trade with his/her AI companion).

For example, the marked place will randomly moved to another empty location by the system, misled the player to the wrong place unless he/she often check his/her map and find the bug happened before he/she arrived the wrong place.(this often happened when a new random quest was given to the player by the system)

For example, some zombies in infected area that fell in the place below to the ground or stuck in some rocks, made players cannot kill them to clear the infected area.

For example, sometimes the player character can cancel his/her attacking action and dodge another zombie’s attack, but sometimes his/her character cannot.

For example, the player cannot check the remaining fuel of his/her car and the car’s model(if you cannot see how much fuel in it, you cannot know that is the time to refuel it or not).

5. Non realistic 3D physical calculation.

For example, if you drive the car and rush on a road but the car only hit a tiny rock, your car will fly to the air even possibly overturns…
For example, all broke abandoned cars are just hard like the mountain and concrete buildings, if you drive the car hit those broke abandoned cars, only your car will damaged and shaken back.
For example, when the player drives the car ran on the jumping platform, the car always hit the ground in 90 ankle

6. It’s no the line of lead prediction of dropping grenades. 

The player can only depend on himself/herself to drop his/her grenades precisely because there is no the line of lead prediction when he/she drops the grenade to help he/she to aim the right target point.

7. There has the random quest that lures the players into the death trap.

For example, sometimes the radio will call for help, even the player comes to the source of the radio call, those survivors cry for help in the last second but becomes zombies in next second before your own eyes! And they will rush to the player with many other zombies, even included some special zombies(freaks) like ferals, screamers! If the player tried to save their lives, will often runs into the center of those zombies.

Sometimes there even comes over 3 ferals or even worse, the battle sound maybe attracted another roaming zombie horde(possibility included a blood plague juggeraut) near the location! Maybe the player can survived but his/her AI companies possibly cannot.

Even the player survived in the death trap quest, the player will only earned 100 influences and some members of the player’s community pity. It’s completely not worth for the quest.

In the logic we all know that if the survivors killed by zombies, they are impossible to become zombies instantly, zombies will eat them alive first until they are all became skeletons. It’s very obviously no time for them to become other zombies. So we can think the random quest designed to trapped players to die by Undead Lab(the game’s developers).

The worst point is sometimes the player still has the chance to save survivors’ life in the random quest, they will not always instant die when the player arrived the place. So the player still cannot just abandon it or ignore it.

This game was fun for like the first 10-20 hours, then it started to dwindle down, cause you do the same thing over and over:
Bring this here, clear infestation there, escort this survivor.. it gets boring fast.

Even the new mode: Daybreak, gets boring after 2-3 playtroughs, cause it's again.. same thing over and over, just defend one person with the arsenal you have. After you get the strategy down, it's also very easy. That wouldn't be a problem, if the devs didn't make Daybreak SO GRINDY. There is around 50-60+ things you need to ""farm"", but each playtrough unlocks only 3 items, if you manage to finish the waves. It takes around 40 minutes to finish one whole playtrough, so you're stuck for hours doing same thing, just to unlock things you might want. Note: Most of the cool stuff you can unlock is unlocked near the end, the unlocks are not random, you have a defined rewards as you go. Most of the stuff is useless in Daybreak/SoD2 anyway.

The game is very unpolished, some obstacles look jumpable/climbable, but the character just jumps in air.
By default the key E is bound to a lot of actions, so often times you do something you didn't want to. 
You have a zombie laying down you can finish with a finisher, but the ""autolock"" makes you grab a different zombie which bites you. 
You can't climb tiny obstacles or rocks, so you often get stuck on them.
The inventory system leaves much to desire, when one sheet of paper takes as much space as a whole portable generator.
It all adds up eventually, making the game more and more frustrating as you find these issues.

Game could use a LOT of polishing to be considered good, but for now, it's kinda meh. Find a different zombie survival game.

In a little more detail the AI are not going to hold your hand while they clear the area for you but they are not completely useless. Effectiveness is affected somewhat by the weapon you give them, especially the weapon fire modes the gun has. Generally on loot trips your pack mule (follower) will in my experience be more effective if the gun you give them makes them default to burst firing an automatic weapon with a decent sized clip (not all guns do you need to find that for yourself). Yes followers become less useful on the highest difficulties and even a liability at times but its your choice, take them on a dangerous mission (i.e. kill other faction) for extra firepower or leave them save and sound at home?

The game is not truly co-op but neither is it useless to play co-op. Some complain progress is not saved, materials not earned etc. This is not fully correct as you can swap characters from your own saves in and out at will and what they carry is swapped out to your save when you put them back on the roster. I will repeat that, they keep what they carry, including materials backpacks. You can therefore earn some materials, character xp etc and if your co-op player is a more advanced friend with good stocks you can with their permission take and store medical items, weapons, plague cure, ammo etc.

The default game-play delivers a particular experience but at 300 hours I do not play full vanilla with a realistic not op ammo stacking mod etc to make the game a little more shooter friendly but not ruin the experience. If you want you can make the default settings even harder if that is the route you want to take. So after completing many games you can still refresh the experience to give the game a new lease of life in a direction you want to take.

Its a decent game with a somewhat faithful representation of zombies (not walls of lemmings throwing themselves of buildings at you or climbing walls like ants) that will scratch the itch for traditional zombie fans.",1640371099,1662752153,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The balance in terms of gameplay is honestly pretty good, you pay for your own mistakes most of the time. You sometimes drive over a bloater on a low-health character, or you fail to GTFO when SHTF, choosing to stay behind and risk your life, sometimes at the cost of it. It's easy to break line of sight and lose a horde of zombies, and while Ferals are vastly overpowered and unreasonable, you can cheese them by Dropkicking them or shooting their heads from atop cars. I suspect other skills effect Ferals the same way Dropkick does, too. Overall it's easy to survive if you're focused, and it's easy to die whenever there's a lapse. 

        But the NPC AI is deficient, sub-par doesn't even begin to describe it. The devs failed HARD in terms of their NPC AI, and although I truly love this game's premise, design, gameplay elements and lore, I feel very disappointed for thought of the AI that Undead Labs actually believed was passable. Sometimes you need to GTFO but your follower stops while running to the car, multiple times on the way to it. Other times you're trying to execute a zombie and a follower makes you stumble, interrupting your execution. Other times, your entire roster of survivors at home base will stand there while a zombie waltzes in and bites you. They literally just don't react to threats sometimes. It's baffling. You can't toggle passive/aggressive/neutral etc. They DO at least have unlimited ammo, but that's more of a pittance afforded the player to balance the game in light of the poor AI design. Similar to how Ferals can't climb on top of cars, because again, triple Feral packs on Lethal would be objectively unmanageable otherwise. Yes you can juggle a feral with a heavy weapon easily enough, but how will you go about juggling 3 of them? You can't. Cheesing their pathing from atop a car is the only way to handle the situation, and I despise it when games give you the solution of ""cheese existing mechanics"" as the only viable option for handling a situation that is common to the core gameplay loop.

        Hostile AI NPC's are a different story. They have magnificent aim, but in defense of the devs, it works well to crouch behind some sort of barrier, and slowly inch your way out until you can shoot them in the head. You can often shoot them before they can shoot you, this way. Another few headshots while they're on the ground, and they'll die. But I personally feel like killing a human should be like killing a zombie: One head shot only, and I would personally label this as a game design flaw. It doesn't fit. It just breaks immersion to shoot hostile NPC's in the head multiple times and see them get down and get back up, repeatedly. But honestly, you can just as easily honk your car's horn and lure infected to a hostile enclave to kill it. That works just as well. 

        Survivor creation was a major point of contempt for me. I rapidly realized that Never Been Sick and Hygiene were the best things to get; Moreover, I rapidly realized that you want Cleaning Chart or Hygiene Standards on as many starting survivors as possible, so I began only accepting characters who have Never Been Sick and Hygiene, with a likelihood of those aforementioned optimal hero skills. I died, a LOT. As expected, given the fact that I was playing Lethal difficulty as a complete noob to the game. As such I had to restart and create new survivors, a lot. The inability to create survivors to my liking basically meant I'd spend an hour randomly generating new characters between every Lethal run attempt, and I'd often accidentally skip over generated survivors that I wanted to keep, because of the mind-numbing monotony of the process. I feel like this is a dopamine trap that the devs put into the game to extend playtime. I guarantee you that at least 30 of my hours were spent in character creation, and I just feel like the current implementation of survivor generation pre-game is insulting to us all. It's literally a slot machine where you can get the dopamine rush associated with gambling, and I am in strong disagreement toward it as a game design decision. It's petty, it's lowly, it's a way for the devs to increase play time, yet while you're creating survivors, you're not actually playing the game. I should not have 30 hours of playtime where I was not even in the actual game. That is an objective game design flaw chosen by the devs on purpose, which is meant to capitalize on the human brain's dopamine production and ramp-up play time numbers, and I see right through it. While Undead Labs would tell you it's in the spirit of the game, it's actually just in the spirit of stimulating psychological addiction in you, but a really unfun and draining kind of psychological addiction. It is not a fun or engaging experience to generate characters. It is rather a period of torturous monotony that disrupts this game's overall potential for fun. I'd recommend they switch to a positive and negative traits-based system, similar to Project Zomboid, wherein you're only allowed to take positive traits if you have taken on negative traits first, to accumulate the required points for the positives. For example, giving someone a trait which makes them eat 50% more food per day gives you 15 positive trait points to spend on them, with Never Been Sick and Hygiene costing 20 trait points each to have, etc. 

(Edit: They added the ability to go backwards in character generation, so you can no longer skip past really good survivors, an EXTREMELY welcomed change to the game. It removed a great deal of the pain and monotony from survivor generation.)

        Anyway I like the game, but there are a lot of design decisions here that I'd deem to be big mistakes in the modern gaming industry. You know how food is often designed to be chemically more addictive, like through aspartame and monosodium glutamate? Games are often designed to be more addictive too, even at the expense of the player. Refer to loot boxes, random generation, etc. While random generation has a valuable place in games, I feel it's misused in State of Decay 2. While I'd recommend using Random Generation Algorithms to randomize the geographical locations of certain buildings, or the generation of loot and the patterns of weather in the game world, they have used it to create a survivor-generating slot machine to stimulate dopamine production in you. It just feels exceedingly cheap. This game is a masterpiece no doubt about it, and it stands alone in its genre, as the only game of its type. But it also falls into quite a fair amount of the common pitfalls associated with video games today. You can tell that Undead Labs cut a lot of corners in development, expect bugs to screw you over sometimes. Frequent autosaves mean you'll be paying for those bugs, too. I recommend you play it, but I don't recommend you start on the hardest difficulty. I personally believe they should gate Lethal difficulty, behind the completion of the game on a prior difficulty. Either that, or make it so we can create custom survivors with a point-based positive and negative trait system. They have to eliminate the monotony between game attempts, otherwise, starting on Lethal difficulty will always remain more a form of mental torture than a privilege for thrill seekers in the fanbase.",1638636771,1662666026,True,8,2,0.570097923278808594,0,True,False,False

So much of these games revolve around fighting against the subpar game mechanics and annoying design choices.  So many of those design choices are incredibly cynical and obnoxious.  Dick-moves by the devs.

- There are many improvements and tweaks from SoD1, some increase fun, atmosphere, and immersion, but others create more hassle, more busy-work, and lots of frustration.  
- constant stuttering, motion-blur.  As bad as the original, if not worse.  That needs fixed.
- Your action button is also your 'talk to companion' button, so instead of opening/closing a door, you often talk to your companion.  Instead of picking up searching a container, you talk to your companion.  IN THE MIDDLE OF COMBAT, instead of using a killing-blow, you TALK TO  YOUR COMPANION.  (And no, you can't change keybinds to be different for those different actions as far as I can tell.  They seem to all be hard-coded to use the same input.)
- zombies SPAWN around you all the time.  This is lazy and a 'cheat' by the devs.  This is an open-world game; to have enemies just spawn around you is pathetic.
- companion AI is a joke for so many reasons there are too many to list, but they'll often just stand there as enemies beat down on them.  Literally just stand there.
- It's night twice as long as daytime; this hinders world exploration, since you often can't see and appreciate the world.  This really sucks if you enjoy the exploration and discovery of open world games.  
- Of course you're constantly being hit w/ missions on the extreme far ends of the map, often at the worse times.  If that happened sometimes, it would be great; if it happens all the time, it gets annoying and feels like a busy-work, resource-spending contrivance.
- Your map marker CONSTANTLY changes location for no reason.
- Teammates who often have the poor AI ; always making noise, getting into trouble, going out of their way to attract zombies, get swarmed, open doors and letting zombies in, etc.  They'll frequently just STAND THERE and let zombies wail on them.
- You go to open a wedged door... so the game puts you into ""bash it open"" mode (spam click L-mouse key) at the risk of making noise.  There's apparently no way to exit this mode.  Once locked in, you must bash the door.  You're screwed if there's a nearby hoard, you go to open a door... and you're forced into ""door bash mode.""
- many many many glitches in regards to missions; given missions that cannot be completed (or even started), campaigns where the missions break and you're given no more missions, etc.
- frequently falling off ladders, instead of actually using them
- As in the first game, it's easy to get vehicles stuck, but they added an ""Unstuck"" command that is helpful

While some of the changes certainly made the game more fun, other changes just create artificial contrived barriers to eat up more time.  However on the whole, it's a worthy successor.  Overall it's fun, great atmosphere, solid experience, easy to put a lot of hours into it.  However there are so many flaws and glitches that tells me either the devs were incompetent, didn't have enough time/resources, or didn't care.

If there's one thing I miss from the first game though, it would definitely be the inclusion of all the other special combat moves for this game like the Double Kill powerhouse move and all the heavy weapons special moves.

If you're familiar with the first game, game mechanics will seem definitely refreshing for a first playthrough in standard difficulty. However, I am confident you will find that the game is extremely easy in any difficulty lower than Nightmare. I would recommend trying Nightmare if you want to match the same kind of challenge that was offered in the first game. State of Decay 2's highest difficulty, Lethal, is honestly way too much for a new or unfamiliar returning player.

The game also still gets substantial updates every now and then, and will seem to continue getting them as the devs work on State of Decay 3.

The multiplayer is utterly disappointing, it just makes the game easier with no balancing in mind, my friend and I looted tons of good stuff so quickly because no zombies were an issue, and by we looted stuff I mean I looted stuff and he stood nearby because the non-host player exists solely to be another gun or baseball bat to hit things with, other players get MAYBE 1 or 2 boxes to loot per house while the host gets 4-10. So if you're looking for a fun singleplayer game, this is it, do not buy this for multiplayer, its a waste of time.

Even after the 30 major updates they released to the game, they didn't add this feature.
Otherwise, clearing one map was solid fun, but clearing the others? 
Why, for the sake of the story? It's not interesting enough. 
I drive an armored car, but when I hit a smaller car, it doesn't move at all. 
Unnecessary unfinished stuff that sucks.
Game is missing DLSS and FSR 2.0 support, not a issue if you got half decent graphic card, but why not use it if it looks better than native resolution (1440p and higher) and eats 30% Watts less.

Only have two issues with the game... It's not very realistic that 99.9 % of the survivors are non white and mostly tiny females.  I guess all the white people with all the guns and bunkers and stuff just gave up.  Who knows?   The second issue is the annoying thing that you can only carry one satchel at a time and can't drop them off at an outpost like you can with other loot.  Same when you want to turn weapons into parts./  you have to do each one individually by making  it your weapon of choice first 
oTHER  than those minor issues, it'a a great game far and above the first one, which wasn't bad just didn't have the same feel as this one.  When a long time survivor gets killed because YOU did a stupid tactic, it hurts  .  Permadeath really adds to the game. Well done 9 out of 10",1661563734,1661563734,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Another part of the game that could be improved would be npcs, instead of them always crying help/aid it would be cool to have your base attacked by random groups of humans attack your base. it would also be cool to see random people engaging in firefights as well.

larger hordes would be great as well as maybe zombies that evolve, it would be cool to add a system of mines to the game that contain a special type of zombie, this zombie will also only appear at night or in dark enviorments.",1661535042,1661535042,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
