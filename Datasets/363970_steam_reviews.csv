[b] Review [/b]
       Clicker Heroes is a great background game or a game to play when your watching tv. At first it is very easy to progress and it becomes much faster once you get a couple of Hero Souls by Ascending. There is alot more strategy than one might expect from a free game. You must decide who to upgrade, which skills to buy, which things to spend you Hero Souls on, which things to spend your Ancient Souls on, when to Ascend, when to Transcend, which heroes to Gild, what missions to send your mercenary, to revive or bury your mercenary, which clan to join, and much more! A great game to just waste some time without spending money. It's free, why not give it a try?

Later on, after a few ascensions, you start to discover patterns in terms of skilling and spending money and rubies. Then the game starts to get more interesting.

Evertyhing does take a lot of time though. it takes ages to aquire frostleaf and even longer to aquire Dread Knight. After that you have to aquire Atlas, but that will take a lot of ascensions, a lot of skilled ancients and also a lot of mercenaries. When coming to a point where you finally can aquire Dread Knight, it takes to long to be able to buy atlas. This could be a point where most people stop playing this game.

PROS
- Addictive gameplay (after a few ascensions)
- Cool but simple graphics
- Casual gameplay which makes and keeps you calm
- Steam achievements
- nice build in RPG like elements (skilling, semi-questing,upgrades)

CONS:
- You NEED to spend money on rubies to get steam trading cards. bad move playsaurus!
- At some point game gets to repetetive, because the gap of progress is to large. (dreadknight to atlas)
- Takes much of your time. Will speed up over time, untill you need Atlas.
- Upgrades via rubies are to expensive. At some point you dont get that much rubies anymore.


Overall this could be a fun game, with a 'frustrating taste' to it unfortunately. If playsaurus would update this game to make progression a bit easier and faster it would be more fun. Steam trading cards should be free imho. The gap from Dread knight to Atlas should be made a lot smaller in order to keeping people interested to the game.

Clicker Heroes is a a drug that requires increasing doses. Try it only if you have a strong willpower. It doesn't at first seem like there's much of a story behind this game, but as you continue you find out more and more about the heroes you've hired. From Bobby the Bounty Hunter's love for the Ice Wizard you hired earlier, to the malicious Abaddon and the attempts to stop his rise of power, the heroes seem to come alive in personality. The graphics are what you might expect from an indie game such as this. They're nice enough, but nothing overly amazing. Very bland and simple, nothing special.

Do you play Counter-Strike: Global Offensive? If the answer is yes, this is the game for you. Do you play HuniePOP? If you answered yes, this game is for you. Do you have fingers? If the answer is yes, this game is for you.

This game has improved my accuracy in games such as Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. I can now hit targets that are 4 meters away from me instead of the usual 2 meters. If you don't think that's progress, I don't know what else I could say to convince you the importance of Clicker Heroes in the life of any gamer.
