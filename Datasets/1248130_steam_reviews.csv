I have 3 different saves going all doing different things and even with new mods being added in to change how I play every new game save.

Thus be prepared, this Farm Sim has a pretty steep learning curve. Equivalent of just driving into a wall. It's a ton to learn and take in, just in the basics of equipment operations and field preparation, that doesn't include the added difficulty that comes from, animal husbandry (6 different animal types), crop management, crop yield boosts, and production chains. 
Don't get me wrong in anyway the game is great, but controls are incredibly unintuitive, physics are um something, the game does a HORRIBLE! job of explaining literally everything, and finally if you want to download mods via the in game mod launcher good luck your gonna be sitting there a good few hours. 
Besides that I'd highly recommend this game and if the dlc (espically the seasons passes) are on sale get em.

2. Some actions are very long and not interesting. F.e. I need to load milk' pallets from factory to truck. Also, AI don't work on all kinds of technics.

The game remains buggy, unfinished, and performance is still terrible. It's arguable whether this game is ready for release in its current state, but I definitely cannot say it's worth paying full price for this. Despite how many hours I've spent on the game, it still very much feels like a beta at the best of times, and it's only thanks to mods that it's all playable for any extended amount of time. There are now a couple hundred major and critical bugs and issues that Giants still refuse to fix or even acknowledge, and for a company that's done nothing but release the same game over and over for 15 years, it's mindblowingly mystifying that they flat out refuse to work on that very same game. Instead of working on their only product, Giants instead focuses on procuring licenses for as many brands as possible, with zero consideration for how relevant those products are to the game, thus we have a dozen (buggy) DLC where the majority are effectively repaints of existing stuff and thus a complete waste of money. Below is my original review, which I still stand by, as nothing's changed since I wrote it 2 years ago.

For FS22, Giants spent a year in lockdown ripping off mods. Nearly every single new feature in the game are all stolen from mods for FS17 and 19 - that's a good 20 or so mods they've copied and pasted into the game. They've done it so liberally that the parts of Seasons and AutoDrive they've stolen even display the exact same buggy behaviour as the mods for FS19. Giants's own contribution? Field stones and rollers, neither of which add anything relevant to the game - in fact it detract since you'd be hard pressed to find a farmer who uses a roller, let alone the way the game wants us to. This literally means that Giants want $44 for the same game as FS19, with a bunch of mods added they weren't involved in the development of, meaning they're charging for someone else's work. Is the game playable? Sure. Should you buy it? Well, if you don't have FS19 and it's on sale, perhaps, but if you do have FS19 then you just have to install a few mods to get virtually the same experience (and 19 is more stable too).

Meanwhile absolutely nothing has been done to fix any of the problems with the game. Overall performance is still terrible, thanks to the game still running everything off a single CPU core - the promised multithreaded performance improvement is nowhere to be seen - which means the framerate still tanks massively at random for no explicable reason. The game is also still unstable and it is very easy to get it to lock up just by having more than 3-4 helpers going at the same time. And because the game only runs on a single core, throwing higher performance hardware at it makes zero difference, the game simply can't utilize it.

Speaking of helpers, they're if anything worse than ever. Just as useless as they've been in the past 12 years, but now they're even more glitchy and will happily stop in the middle of a field for ""unknown error"". They still won't stay on the field, they still turn around in crops and need a whole field to turn around because they don't know how to make 3-point turns, they bitch about stuff ""in the way"" way outside the field where they shouldn't be going anyway, they won't follow the edge of the fields, and the list goes on and on.

Giants still tries to shove as many brands into the game as possible and don't care that there isn't a proper spread in the equipment selection as a result, or that some of the required equipment is missing. So we have issues like the US corn planters that don't have fertilizer tanks because you're supposed to have fertilizer tanks on the tractor, which don't exist in the game, which in turn means you cannot use this equipment the same way you would IRL. This of course comes from the fact none of the developers know anything about farming and are too busy making DLC to learn. 

And then we have the ongoing issue where Giants refuses to fix bugs, glitches, and everything they do wrong. Like when they added the Xerion 5000, but the tracked version goes 50 km/h even though it is limited to 30 km/h IRL to not destroy the tracks, and the wheeled version is missing all the wheel options Claas offer, even though they included those very same wheel options (correctly) with the SaddleTrac and the Class DLC for FS19. Even though it only takes a very simple change to the XML to fix it (so a couple minutes copy pasting at most), Giants insist they won't do it. Just like they won't fix the sugarcane planter where the wheels don't turn so it's impossible to reverse with it, the bale grabber that's hardcoded to the wrong keybindings, and many other minor things that could be easily fixed if they just bothered spending 5 minutes editing the XML. It is absolutely petty that they won't spend a few minutes fixing minor things, almost like they want to look like a bunch of raging amateurs, and their attitude to bug reports more than underline that they don't care about the quality (or lack thereof) of the only product they make.",1659219162,1708164294,False,360,44,0.766100108623504639,0,True,False,False

There is no way you can do the 2 hour refund trick to demo this game, after 2 hours you will have maybe figured out how to plow a field while keeping straight lines. And also because this is not a game. I classify this in the category it's not fun, it's addictive. So make sure you can get addicted to this.

I don't have much with farming but watching other people play I saw that it had some depth to it so I decided to make this my time filler while I take a break from my usuals. After a rough start trying to find my way through the slightly ambiguous UI (it took me way longer to figure out how to sell chickens than is necessary...) and having trouble figuring out what all the machines are for, I started to get the hang of it. The tutorial is dreadful by the way, I learned to play by doing two false starts where I just threw away money buying random machines and learning how to use them before I started the third serious playthrough.

And after 50 hours of play, I... kind of go back on my claim that it has depth. It has some depth, but not as much as I thought it had. To me it feels like an incomplete sim, a beta version for the full release which might just be Farm Sim 24/25. Part of the game feels rather complete. You can plant grains and other goods, harvest them and they form feed for animals, materials for other products in a product chain or you can just sell them on their own. That's fine. Except its extreme busy work because to properly prepare a field you need to plow/cultivate it, fertilize it twice, roll it, optionally remove large stones, lime it and remove weeds. Good god. I would really recommend turning off stones, that is just one grind too many. Thankfully the game is very configurable.

You can let tasks be done by the computer so you can multitask, or you can do multiplayer. A common thing to do is that one does harvesting and the other drives a truck next to it to collect the product so the harvester never has to stop to be emptied. It's just... the AI is dumber than a doorstop. One tree and they will ram themselves right into it and get stuck. They get stuck on corners so you can't trust them to even drive your equipment from A to B successfully. Under-developed to say the least.

But I wanted to do a chicken farm. And... chickens are in my eyes really under-developed too. You buy them (pretty cheap, to be honest), they magically transport themselves to your coop and if you just keep the food storage from going empty, they will on their own grow, multiply and produce eggs which you can sell or put into a production chain. And that's it. That's chickens. If the coop didn't radiate some clucking sounds I would confuse them for being plants. It is almost passive especially if you compare it to growing crops. Oh yeah you have the option of putting roosters in your coop so the chickens multiply faster, but truth be told... you don't need them. Chickens multiple like Gremlins in a swimming pool already. 

There is more you can do. You can do forestry which is kind of a cheat way to get money quick, but the game needs that because otherwise you'd be left with only the option of cheating your way into money with mods, or taking out huge loans and have them be a pain in the neck. In the official maps the devs hid collectables all around which are worth a thousand bucks a pop so if you manage to find them (and they are not well-hidden) that's a few free cheap machines right there. You have greenhouses which are largely passive if you provide them with water. If you install mods you can do things like solar panels to make passive money. On the planting side of things you can plant cotton and setup fields of olives and grapes which have their own unique way of prep and harvesting. You can plant root vegetables like potatoes and beets, but they are a massive pain in the neck to harvest. It takes for-e-ver and you need specialized harvesters to do so which are very slow. You can also do grass which is food for animals, or turn it into hay or silage. A lengthy multi-step process requiring several machines and transports.

Long story short. Lots to do... it is kind of fascinating because of the many different machines you get to drive around and use but a pretty shallow experience nonetheless. I am a little disappointed. I have more fun watching other people play it while they edit their videos to skip over the waiting parts than I have playing it myself where there is no skipping.",1707950965,1707950965,True,6,0,0.604894340038299561,0,True,False,False

This simulator version is beautiful, on the surface that is, and the inclusion of production chains into the main game is a good idea but not without an entire new set of bugs. There's a new crop 'sorghum' and the draw distance has improved 'somewhat' plus a list of other new features including new vehicles/equipment that are super-detailed, even the electrics cables are modelled with the air lines and this is for every trailer and implement. The sky looks good and better than before but needs work, the storms are nice, and there's seasons with snow.

The Bad:
BUGS! There are bugs that should NOT have been in this software at release and I expected a lot more from this developer after so many game versions. I also think that the Giants team may be 'drifting' from their roots and the outcome of these new ideas is showing through like a turd in a swimming pool. UPDATE 2024: the bugs are still present, after all this time WTH?

The Ugly:
This version of Giants farming simulator introduced advertisements EVERYWHERE, and they are DLC adverts, even when the server is serving you adds, and when its all up and working properly, you will get 60 of them, that's right folks, 60 Billboards & Signs! In your face everywhere! Offline, there is 'mass' FrizzySpizz soft-drink spamming! (these soft drink signs may be replaced with even more DLC 'flogging' but I have not checked lately as this game is no longer enjoyable to me and I rarely play it anymore)

The Verdict:
After many hours of game play, I can say without any reservation; don't buy it unless on sale and even then, be aware that the DLC is simply not worth it (the platinum expansion was OK but not worth the writing home about). And the 'popular' passenger script is hidden behind a DLC paywall instead of being included in an update like it SHOULD'VE BEEN! That's just a pathetic money grab. The basic game price is OK but all the DLC is over priced for what your get (most of it is in MOD form anyway). 

Also, the boxed set is seriously 'lacking' for a better word.

---------------------

Final word -- 60 advertisement objects in the US Map and 40 in the others, really Giants? come on...

The 'very positive' review count is based on a massive fan community from Europe and can not be trusted as a sign of quality because all the FS releases get the same review status. 

I doubt very much if I will purchase your next FS Giants as I believe you have lost your way and are simply NOT listening to your community at all!",1637671885,1707823927,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Recently, I had purchased FS22 through Steam. It has been a wonderful experience. The way I play the same is with Season and a 28 Day monthly cycle. I am still on Year 1 of my farm using the Fox Farm map. 

The big change for FS22 from FS19 is the level of detail we have to pay attention to with Cultivation with plants and with the nurture of animals. I like that we have to add those things to the game. So the people that do not want to play to those advance details of farm life can keep is simple. For the advance player, we can add more depth to the game.

What do I like most about FS22?

I like the little things we have to learn with animals and plants. There is a huge list of line items to learn.

For example, Horse Care, I prefer to ride the horses and train them rather than put them in a production cycle and press a button. The game allows me to enjoy the aspect but the game does not force another player to do what I do. I wish that we could treat the hooves, and medical care of the animals and plants. Also, I wish that we could include the grooming care of the animal too.

I like the Pump and Hose DLC. 

This DLC has been a challenge for me. There are many parts to this system and you need to be aware of them all. However, the DLC has been very fun for me. I like learning new things every time I play the game.

What do I dislike about the game?

For me, the problem that ultimately arises with Farming Simulator is that you put so much time and labor into the farm then you have to throw it away every two years to keep up with the production cycles or the game developers. That is hard for me to do. It can be painful.

I do recommend the game to other people.

God Bless and Thank you

As a complete newcomer to farming games, start a new game and try to fertilize your first field after harvest (or change crops).  There are many problems that you will encounter, the first of which is that [b]basic info is not available in game[/b].  There is a brief tutorial that covers <5% of the game play and a wiki style overview of high level topics.  There are no tool tips giving additional information on tools/machines or additional requirements for a particular job.  Players must seek online help in order to fill in the knowledge gap and develop skills needed for the higher level wiki topics to become relevant.  


At the time of this review I've spent ~25 hours on YouTube for 10 hrs in game.

DLCs aren't worth it do not buy, get mods instead.
Wish it was a little more polished and game devs focused on QOL more than DLC releases that are buggy.  Go play the game, play the game with couple of buddies! Game sucks. Play it, its good.

But a few of us still know. You gotta be willing to put in the time. Make the sacrifices. And the hard choices. The job's got its perks, don't get me wrong. The sweet smell of the morning dew, the way the warm sun and the cool breeze can dance across your skin. But don't think it's a game. The farm's got a way of sorting the wheat from the chaff. Just remember to keep your wits about ya. You fall...you get back up again. Because this is more than just a job. It's a calling. Who else would choose to wake up early in the morning, tear up their hands working in the field all day, and then spend the evening planning how they're gonna do it all over again...better...tomorrow? Day after day. Season after season. Year after year. That's a calling that's never ending. It stretches far forward and back from us as long as farmers have been tending this earth. And farmers will be around as long as such a thing exists. Tomorrow will be secured by those willing to dirty their hands today. So when you feel alone out there in the field, just remember, you're not. Think about all those that have come before you...and all those that will follow.

But the game gives people a little perspective of some of the work actually needed in order to be a farmer. It still misses a lot of things, but is understandable why it's not included in the game. 
Compared with the previous Farming Simulator games throughout the years, FS22 has improved graphics and physics. 
A lot of work in physics is still needed when it comes to pallets / logs or anything else that has to do with front loaders and cranes. 
I also miss a lot of tractors, but thankfully it is a lot easier now with the downloadable content menu inside the game. In previous versions, you had to download these manually from the internet, where they often didn't work as intended.

When I first got it, I struggled but decided to keep pushing through and trying to make it work. I wanted to give it a chance, because at the time I wasn't aware that I only had a certain amount of playtime before I could refund it. I went for a refund and explained the situation, was denied. So admittedly I am salty about it and regret trying to give it a chance (I gave it a chance because I thought it was just me being a bit dumb and that things would get easier). Since I was stuck with it, I decided to keep playing. I have 24 hours total on record and while I have learnt more than I did initially this game is still quite stressful and I still see it as a waste. 

This game is made for a particular type of gamer and if you're a new player looking to try it out, please look into the refund time limit before hand and refund it if you find it a struggle within that time. Don't make the mistake I did, you can always try it out again later or wait to see if the game is discounted.

The gameplay is very faffy and tedious, it becomes frustrating very quickly. There's only so many times one can drop a bale of hay before they ragequit. I don't believe even saints have the patience for those damn bales LOL. 

The game also has a lot of bugs. I've noticed things are very easily sent flying, two vehicles giving each other a gentle smooch sends them twirling into the air like some deranged ballerina. Admittedly, this was the best experience I have had with this game. I love the quirky bugs, they provide a breathe of fresh air. A break from the damn bales!

Mods make the game way more tolerable. They have been my saving grace for a lot of things, but it is still frustrating. The mod support is pretty good from what I've seen.

A major part of the gameplay involves growing and transporting produce. I have only dabbled with the plant side of farming a couple of times (preferring instead to cheat cash to design my farm how I want it or to try out different vehicles or mess around with the animal side of things), so I can't give much on that aspect. However, transporting produce is a nightmare. Trailers and trucks are awful at turns (unless you want to make multiple small trips with a small trailer across the map), the NPCs have clearly never even seen a driver's license and reversing with a trailer is a nightmare. My tractors wear them on their side like a rich lady wears a designer handbag, I swear. 

Farming Simulator players are a different breed of gamer and they scare me tbh (anyone who can faff around with stupid bales and handbag trailers for ""fun"" is not human, I don't know what they are. I don't think I want to know LOL). However, I respect that they enjoy this game and clearly the game must be doing well to have so many versions of it. Like the FIFA of farming. It just isn't the game for me and people like me. As I said before, feel free to give it a go just make sure you know your refund time if it doesn't work out. 

I will now dip and avoid playing the game for many months, before deciding to reinstall it, rage at bales and quit for many more months.",1705941820,1705941820,False,0,0,0.436507940292358398,0,True,False,False

Les poteaux électriques et les voitures non jouables semblent toujours être placés de manière à gêner le joueur au pire moment possible, rendant les déplacements frustrants et parfois même agaçants.

Un autre point négatif majeur réside dans le manque d'informations sur des éléments apparemment simples mais cruciaux. La recherche constante pour résoudre des problèmes mineurs devient rapidement ridicule, ajoutant une couche d'irritation inutile à l'expérience de jeu.

Le temps d'attente entre les différentes tâches et le manque de diversité dans les activités disponibles une fois que toutes les tâches liées à la croissance des plantes sont accomplies contribuent à un vide de gameplay. Cette lacune laisse le joueur avec peu d'options, ce qui peut s'avérer ennuyeux et peu stimulant. (Utiliser le lits pour dormir 5 fois pour passer 5 mois)….

Un aspect particulièrement décevant de Farming Simulator est son économie peu inspirante. L'obligation d'attendre le moment parfait de l'année pour vendre ses produits peut sembler réaliste, mais dans le contexte du jeu, cela crée une frustration inutile. L'idée de synchroniser les ventes avec une période spécifique pourrait être un choix intéressant, mais elle est mal exécutée ici, entraînant des périodes d'inactivité déconcertantes.

Cependant, le jeu n'est pas dépourvu de points positifs. Les animations des divers outils agricoles sont indéniablement bien réalisées, offrant une esthétique agréable qui contribue à l'immersion. Malheureusement, ces aspects positifs ne parviennent pas à compenser pleinement les lacunes majeures du jeu.

En résumé, Farming Simulator souffre de collisions agaçantes, d'une information insuffisante sur des éléments simples, d'attentes prolongées et d'une économie déconcertante. Malgré des animations visuellement attrayantes, ces points négatifs plombent l'expérience globale du joueur et laissent une impression mitigée, voire décevante, du jeu.

It lags even on high-end systems if you have any mods installed at all. Most cool mods are locked behind a paywall; most you can find leaked, but some are too obscure to find. Lots of the Patreons are just little kids who are ripping off someone else's mod and making it drop your frames by 20 while having like 2 features.

I have never really gotten into farming because I have no motivation; I just prefer to build cool farms then move on. Most of the tractors in the game have pretty nice customization for a tractor. I just wish that there were more incentives to be able to own a small-scale farm with smaller equipment. The forklifts, pallets, front loaders/wheel loaders are a mess, also when you are playing on a keyboard without joysticks, same with the forestry machines.

The DLC packs are overpriced for what you get and are not worth it. (I can hook you up though; comment on this post). The snow plowing does not work correctly even with base game implements. Sometimes you are plowing, and you will just leave a bunch behind. Animals are not worth it in my opinion; all you need to do is give them food and water.

The game, like I mentioned earlier, is terribly optimized, and if I remember correctly, it runs on a single core? Don't quote me on that, but either way, it does not run very great on modded maps. The whole point of the game is to build a bigger farm, right? But in the beginning, the game is really slow, and there is nothing to do when waiting for crops to grow besides just skipping time, and that feels cheaty.

If I had people to play with, I bet I could get into farming, but I just can't recommend you to buy this unless you like repetitive, boring gameplay or have friends to play on a server with. If you want some mods, I can also hook you up with those; I recently trimmed my mods to mods that are actually good and don't lag your game. I wish I could give it a positive review, but I feel like the devs don't care about people who can't afford to spend 8 bucks for 2 new tractors or the entire cost of the game to get one map and a half-assed forestry system. The majority of people cannot afford joysticks, but then again, with a mouse and keyboard, you are limited, so I'm not sure how to fix it. If I had the choice, I would give it a mixed rating, but because of what I have said, I'm not going to recommend it.

This latest installment in the Farming Simulator series is not just a game; it's a virtual gateway to the serene and rewarding life of agriculture.

The game offers a vast expanse of farmland, presenting an array of activities that are both engaging and realistically portrayed. The attention to detail in the machinery and farming techniques is astounding, providing an authentic farming experience. Whether it's the roar of the tractor or the gentle sway of crops in the breeze, every aspect of the farm life is meticulously crafted.

The addition of new features, such as the dynamic seasonal cycle, adds a layer of strategy and realism. Managing your farm through the changing seasons, with their unique challenges and opportunities, is incredibly fulfilling. It's not just about planting and harvesting; it's about being attuned to the rhythms of nature.

The game's graphics are breathtaking, with picturesque landscapes that make every moment in-game a pleasure to behold. From the golden hues of a sunset over a field of ripening wheat to the crisp, snowy wonderland in winter, the visuals are a constant delight.

Multiplayer mode brings a communal aspect to the game, allowing you to collaborate with friends or other players online. This adds a social element to farming, where you can share strategies, help each other, and enjoy the fruits of your labor together.

One of the most impressive aspects of Farming Simulator 22 is its accessibility to both novices and seasoned players. The game offers a range of difficulty options and tutorials that make it easy for anyone to jump in and start their farming adventure.

In summary, Farming Simulator 22 is a beautifully crafted game that offers a tranquil yet engaging escape into the world of farming. Its combination of realistic gameplay, stunning graphics, and a multiplayer option makes it a must-play for anyone interested in experiencing the joys and challenges of agricultural life.

Playing that was all I could of ever asked for. However, as soon as I upgraded to a PC about a year ago I stumbled across YouTube channels featuring mods(Huge shout out for The Squad & Austin Farmer). This made me go on some sort of mod spree where I downloaded cool maps, trucks, cars, tractor, even boats, you name it. I have since then calmed down but I do still use the mods very frequently and have almost never been disappointed. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone. There are so many opportunities in this game. Whether you just want to role-play with your friends or farm solo, its all up to you! So yeah, please check this game out its awesome.

The quality of life improvements from 2019-now is outstanding. Most things are more user friendly, and the new production chains are a great asset. you can tell they pay attention to the modding community as they successfully implemented seasons into the game play which makes it much more immersive and fun to play. If you've liked Farm Sim in the past, or are just looking for a fun and relaxing game that's easy to get into, I highly recommend.

Now 62 hours of game time in and still can't recommend this game enough. The Platinum Expansion is well worth the money!


1/11/24 Now at 400 something hours and still really love this game! Platinum Expansion is still very good, and Premium is interesting. I am not the biggest fan of root crops, they don't vibe well with my style of game play as we don't really grow them in my area, but I do like the continued dedication to the production chains and the obvious desire to keep bringing their fanbase new things! Now if only they could put some effort into AI... the workers are better than previous but still a pain. Thanks to our great modding community, this is easily overcome with CoursePlay and AutoDrive but it would be nice to not need those...

So, I was a little salty on my first review of this game, i believe reasonably so, given that i'd encountered 3 seperate game breaking bugs in my first couple hours, but the good news is that those 3 have been fixed ( My crops now actually grow when i plant em, Contracts now payout when i finish em,and don't just get stuck at 85% and if i have seasons turned on, they actually change and it doesn't just snow year round ). They changed the way crops work in this update of the franchise, Crops take longer to grow compared to previous versions but seem to give more liters of Crop per field and that crop is worth more at the sell point. That pans out roughly even for me but it was a surprise to find out. i look forward to seeing what the community and giants come out with.",1637805835,1705017176,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The game seems to be playable on a dedicated server now. Been playing 30+ hours over without any of the problems listed below. With the current price tag of 20€, I would recommend to consider buying it.


Original:

I've been playing this for hours upon hours since FS15, and it has always been riddled with bugs and crappy phsyics. All that is fine by me - it's kinda charming after all. What is not fine by me is Giants publishing a game that is not in a playable state if you want to play with your friends. 

My friends and I have tried different hosting services for our dedicated. The common theme for all of them, you ask? None of them actually lets us save the progress we make. I really want to recommend this game at this point, as multiplayer is a crucial part of the fun. 

The reports of trouble with multiplayer saving started to come in December 2021, four months ago when writing this review. In NONE of the forum threads Giants have showed any effort to tell us when it will be fix, possible work-arounds and so forth. That's not okay, not for a game charging a premium price from it's customers. 

I might change this review in the future if the issues is resolved, but for now I don't recommend anyone splashing 40€ on this game.",1647553376,1704932343,True,0,0,0.737157106399536133,10,True,False,False

But no no no, - here is a new DLC with a shiny new whatever.
THE MECHANICS OF THE GAME DO NOT WORK CORRECTLY.  I should not have to hire someone to harvest a field and find them moments later stopped for no reason; running into another piece of equipment or leaving random swaths of the field unharvested. I spend all my time cleaning up what the hired hands do.  If this is a lesson in reality then I would like the chance to train them or at the very least fire the worst of them.  

Seriously what gives?  The hired help cognition of their job is not far removed from a joke.  

Are we thinking of fixing this any time soon?

Until then- I am done.

The controls for driving are incredibly delayed and finnicky - It may be realistic for the wheels turning but it gets incredibly annoying while trying to drive around with your machines, both on roads and on fields.
If you're not someone who's a walking encyclopedia on agriculture, you will have a really REALLY hard time figuring out what to do. While in the shop, vehicles lack a description- Anything basic such as what they are used for. (I may be wrong, but I just couldn't find this information).

The tutorial (if you can even call it that) is incredibly short, and only explains the absolute basics (like steering, attaching stuff and 4 default machines), while anything beyond that, such as fertilization, seasons, map navigation, forestry, building, animals, etc. is up to you to figure out, using their completely text + image based guidebook in a menu.

I'm certain that for someone who knows a lot about farming, this game is perfect, but for a casual gamer like me, I really cannot enjoy this game. Unfortunately because of this, I refunded within an hour and a half of playing- I just couldn't figure stuff out.

Props to the farmers out there, but for many you'd probably be better off with Stardew valley or something along those lines.",1704350414,1704350414,False,2,1,0.489610373973846436,0,True,False,False

There isn't a lot of room for automation -- the AI workers aren't that smart, but there are mods to expand the automation aspect. The grind is fairly slow at first, but that's sort of expected for the Farming Simulator series.

Side note, FS23 on mobile is very similar both visually and gameplay. I wouldn't call FS23 a port of FS22, because there are no mods, it doesn't have all the controls, it has fewer machines, no contracts, the maps are different, etc. But FS23 does feel more like ""FS22 lite.""

Let's start off with the visuals, as they definitely need work. For example, the water reflections are absolutely terrible, as there's invisible trees showing on the water.  Also, the water ripples aren't even there.  In addition, the lackluster tree designs left me scratching my head.

Character customization? More like character limitation! Wardrobe options are on the slim side, and forget about defining facial or body features. Hair choices? Limited. Color options? Unfortunately, its all limited. It's like the farm fashion police are on patrol.

Missions, oh nice! Harvesting, bailing, fertilizing, and seeding are all well and included in the game.  However, where's the liming, chaff/silage, transport missions, and weed control action as contract work?  Unfortunately, all are MIA.  Moreover, don't get me started on the realism front. Tracks and multiple wheel sets on farm tractors and implements are a great addition to the game, although field conditions don't affect the use of these features. In addition, vehicles sipping on DEF? Not in this game.  You'll have to look on a mod website for these items.

Palm tree enthusiasts, brace yourselves! Giants didn't bring palm trees to the party despite requests from the consumer, for the forestry side of the game. DLCs? appears to be somewhat limited content. Maps and vehicles are slim pickings, although there are some nice ones.

Now, the silver lining – the game nails the down-to-earth farmer experience. Planting crops, raising animals, it's all there. Yet, the real MVPs? The modders. They've transformed this game into a global agricultural extravaganza, bringing in maps, machinery, and all the gameplay tweaks that Giants missed.

In a nutshell, if you're dreaming of a serene life in the digital countryside, Farming Simulator 22 might just appeal to you. It's a chill, entertaining game with a farm-life vibe. Just be ready to rely on mods for the full farming buffet.

Farming Simulator 2019 was the funnest one for me because of this reason: a mod map. I love to give myself as much of a realistic simulator as possible. I started on hard, and the map gave you absolutely nothing with prices of land being extremely realistic. It was a challenge and it felt real, starting with the worst equipment you could imagine barely scraping by to buy anything at all and not completely run out of money. It was hard but very rewarding and fun.

What I hate about this one is there is no challenge. You start even on the hardest difficulty with all the best tractors and 500,000 to buy a huge plot of land (And in almost all maps the land is worth absolutely nothing) already right off the bat you just won. After two harvests you have thousands. That isn't realistic you don't just start with everything. I love on simulators where you really start with nothing which is how it really is. I get having difficulty changes like easy modes for people who wanna just farm but if people want a challenge make it possible to have a challenge!

And when you want to make a challenge and you wanna start with nothing and sell the vehicles it makes it worse because then you make 600,000+ on top of the 500,000 and now you have enough to buy HUGE land and nice tractors and then after again even one or two harvests you have enough for almost anything.

Almost all mod maps are like that to. I had to spend a entire day looking for a map that didn't just give me the best harvester and tractor in the game starting.

I know i'm weird on this but I want a challenge I'm related to a farmer and farming is way more challenging and harder then this by a long shot. This game makes it a breeze I want a challenge at all.

So if your looking at this game and wanting to think, have problems, feel really rewarded, and go very sim this isn't really the one unless you find a good mod map.",1704016102,1704016384,False,0,2,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

1248130,154426642,76561198450158597,0,12,114,0,52,1703688932,So this is my first time playing any game like this and I just wanna say that getting started on this game is insanely hard. The game gives you a half assed backwards tutorial that doesn’t really explain much and you’re kind of forced to watch YouTube videos and other stuff for you to understand what to buy and understand harvest etc etc. Which in my opinion is a very stupid way of learning a game especially something that’s supposed to relaxing and calming like this…The game kind of expects you to know what to do when you come into the game. I’ll stick with it but getting started as a beginner with no knowledge is very annoying. Like bro I just wanna get my farmer boy shit going,1703567156,1703567445,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am still having more fun on FS19 @244fps as FS22 can not handle ultra wide screen.

As of march 23 2022 it is no longer playable when they did the last update. unable to roll back as they have removed ultra wide screen.

Some have had success by deleting the cash. I was 1 of the many that this did not help. Looking forward to the fix. Or looking for a refund.

is it really worth updating. NOT really. there are so many modes for 19 it feels better runs better.

you know this company has given up when the DLC are available the same day its released.

stick with 19 and grab all the free mods that will make 19 much better than 22 and save your money for something much better.",1637854472,1703259406,False,20,0,0.541279613971710205,0,True,False,False

Worse is the cruft that should have been fixed long ago still lingering on from version to version.

The food ratio calcuations for animal pens is still a huge mess and doesn't work properly, especially for pigs.

The developers go through and check each and every mod out and make sure it works and is up to par with their game. The mods are accessible from right in game off the main menu so no need to go to a separate site and since they are approved by the game developers you can be rest assured they work. there are thousands of mods, so many so that they are categorized into 10-15 different categories. You can get new vehicles, implements, buildings, animals and even game mechanics! The options are truly vast. most vehicles, are customizable where you can choose all kids of parts as well as colors. you can change the game mechanics through mods!  You can make this game as realistic or as fake and gamey as you choose or a balance in between as I have. The sim world is your oyster!

Farming Simulator 22 is brilliant with the wide range of things to do, the graphics are very good and the general gameplay is fantastic. The realism in terms of economic difficulty and ways to make extra money doing contracts is a very realistic part of farming simulator that i love
The driving physics and object movement is good 
Controller support is fantastic as my two Logitech Side panels and g29 work brilliantly 
Force feedback support needs improving as i have to reset my g29 everytime i tab out of fs22 (sometimes it takes upto 7 attempts) 
The mod community is the best ive ever seen with Giants actually testing every mod that get published on the in-game modhub 
Overall i love farm sim 22 and i hope to keep playing for another 50k hours and beyond!
I would HIGHLY recommend!

(I am a software engineer, so know how these firms work internally.) FS19, the previous edition, was beset by bugs on release and took at least 6-12 months to become stable. This release has far more major bugs at release, and 5 months later and multiple patches, many bugs are still getting worse not better, and these aren't infrequent, minor bugs either. These are frequent, rage-quit inducing bugs.
Half of the community are really nice people, but a vocal minority are aggressively unpleasant fanboys who believe Giants are perfect beings from another dimension.
I only bought FS22 to play one mod map - Calmsden Farm, which is beautiful. If that map hadn't been released, I'd have not bought this game. Maybe I shouldn't have anyway, but I'll try and get my moneys worth. It might be stable by summer 22.

edit - It now appears that there is a ""complete your collection"" bundle, which offers a degree of savings to those who purchased the base game prior to the announcement of the premium edition / 2023 summer sale. Still think this was more likely a reflexive response to community reaction vice deliberate planning though...and if it was the latter, that's probably worse (imo)...

TL;DR - Since I paid (near) full price for the base game around launch, I'm not able to benefit from the current sale...  Nor the previous one when the Platinum Edition was released...  See the pattern emerging?

I really want to write good things about this game, having been with the franchise since FS15.  While I have not subscribed to the new season pass model (I despise it, personally, and several of the DLC are either highly niche or functionally repaints of existing elements in game), I have enjoyed the updated gameplay, new production chains, maps and especially the FS22 Platinum Expansion (I like logging, I find it fun!). 

However, the increasingly aggressive monetization and what feels like increasingly frequent hollow/empty promises is slowly killing the game for me (sadly).

The 2023 Summer Sale is just a giant slap in the face to long-term supporters. 

This is the opportune time to pick up the game if you are new - you can get the base game AND both season passes (functionally, almost everything released and planned at this time, look for the ""Farming Simulator 22: Premium Edition"" bundle) for roughly the same price as we who already bought the game (and supported the developer!) have to pay for ONE of the season passes... Not even a discounted ""Complete your Collection""-style bundle made available, nor are any of the season passes or DLC on sale individually (except the recently announced Premium Expansion, which has a fairly typical 10% PRE-release discount).  

I fully support monetization of DLCs in this franchise (they have a steady pacing of releases, some of which are free), but the overall value seems to be decreasing - and so to has the frequency and scale of sales. 

There is also the highly controversial Kubota Pack, which is required for multiplayer passenger capability - something modders have provided in previous iterations for free, could have (and seriously, should have) been included in the base game has now been functionally paywalled. 

Come on, Giants - you used to be one of the developers that others were compared against. Maybe your publisher has gotten too greedy? It's not too late...",1688253067,1701455348,True,0,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False

This might be what people enjoy about the game, in which case I'm happy for you, but I actually enjoy games that force you to work through difficult sim situations and I actually enjoy the tedium of repeated steps towards accomplishing a slightly bigger step in turn working towards a reward that only makes it slightly easier for you to repeat the same exact loop over and over and honestly, this game is too much for me, any decision beyond cultivating a neighbour's field or weeding my own 3 fields is likely to set me back and I just can't be bothered.

To play this game more realistic you need a lot of mods which fortunately all work very well and quite easy to load while in the game ! Updates of these mods you get also info ingame and you can switch them on and off whenever you like.
Without mods i´m sure will not have played this game for long !

The Ford series 10 f.e are Mod tractors and as you can see they work perfect ingame.

I don't recommend this series.
My kids are starving because I don't work.
I don't work because I have such an important farm to care for.
Horses need riding, and the pigs act like complete pigs and constantly need food and water.
I am always looking for that dumb dog while being elbow deep in tractor grease.
I am thinking about a forth mortgage so I can invest in the Holstein market.
My greenhouses are just barely making it and I am constantly at risk of having to toss my salad...

Ask any farmer what they love the most about their profession and you will get different answers, but all of them will agree on one thing...theres nothing better than the smell of freshly tilled earth.
In Farmer Simulator 22 you wont get to experince that but you can do pretty much [b]anything[/b] a farmer does while on the field.
[b]Truth be told it´s not much of a jump from FS19 as FS19 was from FS17 but it has its charms.[/b]  
New crops to choose from (Olives, Grapes and Sorghum), the Seasons mechanic is now implemented on the game itself, field care is now a more serious thing (rock removal, lime , weeds, compaction etc) and Huge maps.
Offical brands of machinery and implements make a appearence on FS22 as usual with the addition of a couple of newcomers. A point to mention is the lack of some machines present on previous games (i miss the old Case 1680 Axial Flow combines and some others) even though you can get them using mods its not the same thing as when the makers of the game honour the classics. But who knows? Maybe Giants has some surprises in store for future DLC´s.

One brand new thing is [b]Production Chains[/b]. It basically gives you a follow up on virtually anything you produce/harvest. Wheat to Bread, Barley to Beer, Milk to Butter or Cheese and so on.

Although it looks and feels amazing, this is not the kind of game that will appeal to every player, not everyone can stand the slow pace of farming, the time it takes to plow or cultivate a field or the careful planning of your campaign to hit the market next year with fields giving good yields.

Its a great game to relax and enjoy at the end of the day and with the plus of learning new things about the rich world of farming. If you are tired of the endless grind, leaderboard climbing and rank crashing routine of whatever you are playing, then get adventurous and give Farming Simulator 22 a try.

Giants Software has really stepped up and improved Farming Simulator, not least that there is more to do more than cultivate and harvest. You can start your own production the ones you choose for your farm.

You can clearly see that the developers have focused so that even beginners understand what to use what for each step. Clarify and categorize in settings and in the shop. Which is fun to see a big improvement on.

The graphics are also an improvement on if you compare previous Farming Simulator games. From better textures on crops, soil everything. Better light and shadows. There is also support for Nvidia DLSS, DLAA and AMD FSR (FidelityFX Super Resolution). Which is worth turning on.

When you choose to play multiplayer and you are on the server and waiting for others to join, you will notice a much appreciated improvement and that is synchronization. It goes twice as fast now when someone joins. You barely have time to blink.

I recommend playing with an ultrawide screen to get the maximum gaming experience, rather than playing on a widescreen where you do not get the same gaming experience at all.

Would I recommend this game? Yes Absolutely. But I recommend getting all the DLC as well because there is more content in them than just playing the base game, such as new machines, tools but also a lot for forestry that makes it more fun to play.",1637895207,1700655440,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

If you've ever dreamed of trading your city slicker lifestyle for the soothing sounds of virtual tractor engines and the sweet scent of pixelated manure, then Farming Simulator 22 is the game for you! Finally, a game that lets you experience the thrill of planting, plowing, and harvesting without breaking a sweat or developing a sudden love for early mornings.

First off, the graphics are so realistic that I almost found myself reaching for a virtual sunscreen during those sunny in-game days. The attention to detail is impeccable, from the mesmerizing sway of the pixelated wheat fields to the way the chickens cluck with pixel-perfect precision. It's like a high-stakes game of ""Is this hay bale real or just a bunch of pixels?"" Spoiler alert: They're pixels.

The game offers an unparalleled sense of accomplishment. Forget climbing the corporate ladder; here, the real challenge is mastering the art of tractor maneuvering without accidentally running over your virtual crops. It's a delicate dance of digital agriculture that makes you question why you never pursued a career in pixelated farming.

Multiplayer mode adds a whole new dimension to the game. Ever wanted to have a virtual barn-raising with your friends? Now you can, and it's surprisingly more entertaining than it sounds. Who knew that coordinating the virtual harvest with your pals could be both hilarious and oddly satisfying?

But be warned, Farming Simulator 22 may cause an unexpected interest in agriculture. You might catch yourself browsing real estate listings for farms, contemplating a career change to become a digital farmer turned real farmer. It's a slippery slope from virtual crops to actual crops, and before you know it, you'll be debating the merits of different types of manure with your neighbors. Farming Simulator 22: Where plowing fields meets planting the seed of a new hobby!

This game has kept me super interested managing the farm and keeping my tractors in a good condition.

Have spent a week in the forums trying to recover a game save.  At the same time realizing on maps I can get to open, Im having a major performance drop.  I have had some success in getting it to load to different stages, but a game save with over 150 hours, another with over 200.  Sadly most of that was doing a lot of terraforming and presetting certain productions on the maps before gam play even started.  HELP Currently, it is uninstalled. 

A worst, for the time being, I am perfectly content with the prepatch version, but how do I get back to it?  How do I turn off the auto update on Steam?

No longer able to recommend. Not able to play since last update - VERY DISAPPOINTING.
Played FS since 2009 but now not a fan. Seems that making the FS22 able to support the new expansion it no longer supports the mods that were working previously.

I do not think that the tutorial is thorough enough for a player who has never played the previous games. I did a few saves to try it out to start and after that I got the hang of it. I recommend checking out all the panels in the options screen because I had completely missed that there was a contracts section. Doing contracts is the easiest way to make money while you wait to harvest during different seasons. I also recommend checking out the different tools and equipment (and the combinations for each) thoroughly before leasing or buying. In my first few saves I got a bit eager and thought I could just return the product if it was the wrong piece of equipment (which you can but you don't get the initial up front leasing cost back). Doing this a few times can drastically affect your finances so I would definitely double check you are using the right equipment first. 

The actual game is beautiful and very peaceful. You can stay very busy and not even notice you've been playing for a few hours. I have played both on my PlayStation and now PC, and I prefer the PC. The controls just make more sense and I find it easier to navigate the help section (which is super important for first time players). The overall variety included in this game is insane giving it a high replay-ability. The three maps are big enough to play for weeks at a time on each and since the seasons are forever changing, you could just play one map forever. It's also more than just planting and harvesting. You can open up restaurants, farmers markets, and export your product. You can build up your farm with advancements like more barns, silos, or solar panels. 

Overall, I highly recommend this game to people who like to build and create. Games that this reminded me of included city skylines, sims, minecraft, and stardew valley.",1699644466,1699644466,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Now, I must admit, this game isn't for those seeking adrenaline-pumping action. It's more of a tranquil and methodical experience, mirroring the pace of real farming. Patience is key here, and if you have a fondness for simulation games that let you take your time, you're in for a serene treat. Farming Simulator 22 is a great choice for players who appreciate simulation games and have a penchant for the agricultural life.

The graphics are way better than the previous farm simulators. Very modifiable and customizable in what you want to do, as weather and sell points can be manipulated to your advantage. The machines are fun and the game turns into a sandbox-genre game once you get into he groove of this game. Farms are just sandboxes capable of growing and making stuff in real life if the farmer is given enough money and time like Farm Simulator 22 does.

If you are still thinking about buying it, make sure you buy the full package at a discount (I think it's premium version or something like that), or you will pay a lot more if you buy the packs over time, and most DLC are not worth the money.

P.S. Giants is using predatory money tactics to make you pay as much as possible if you are a long time player, they will charge you more for DLCs than it would if you are a new player, give you less content as the DLCs are split weirdly (see for yourself with the whole Platinum packs/DLC and the newer Premium pack/DLC)",1699259573,1699259573,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As the name suggests, it is a Simulator, more than a game. You will drive around and solve logistical issues manually, so don't expect super planned campaign that will guide you through every hour of gameplay.

However, if you are looking for chill, sandbox experience, you want to relax after stressful day at work (or lost match in fast FPS game), go for it.

Not everyone likes DLC policy, however you can just go for the big expansions and ignore the small ones, as the modding scene is huge - you can download many vehicles, maps and game changing tools.

Let me tell you, for $39.99, it’s worth every penny – or cent – for the hours of entertainment, bewilderment, and outright hilarity it offers.

First up, the graphics. Ah, the beautiful, crisp, breathtaking graphics. I’ve been around the digital block a few times and I can tell you, I've never seen corn sway in the breeze quite like it does in FS22. With scenery scoring an easy 10/10, the maps are so realistic, you can practically smell the fresh country air and feel the chill of the winter snow. Elmcreek, Haut-Beyleron, and Erlengrat – each one a picturesque jewel in the farming crown.

Now, onto the machines – the heart and soul of any farming enterprise. They start off gleaming, pristine, and before you know it, they're caked in dirt, just like the real deal. Rain, snow, all that beautiful stuff. They’ve thought of everything. The animations are something to behold – watching a crop sparayer folding and unfolding is an oddly satisfying way to spend an afternoon.

Beware of setting an unfortunate username! The game's character editor seems to develop an unhealthy attachment to your first choice, forcing you to change it every time you log in. I’m seriously considering making ""UsernameRegret"" my permanent moniker.

And let's talk about the DLCs. Yes, some are fantastic – the Göweil Pack and Platinum Expansion, absolute steals at $9.99 and $19.99 respectively, and who can resist the charm of the Zetor 25 K for a mere $0.99? But the others, well, let's just say it feels more like a 'donation' to the developers than a value-add to the game.

However, not all is bountiful in the fields of Farming Simulator 22. I've got some beef with the size of the maps. I mean, if I'm in a pickup truck, it shouldn't take me just 15 minutes to get from one end to the other while respecting speed limits. This isn't a Sunday drive, it's farming!

And then there are the AI workers, oh what a joy they are. You'd think they were driving a Ferrari across Monte Carlo the way they charge for their services! Picture this: you task them with the simple job of hauling sugar beets from one end of our admittedly small map to the other. They putter along at the blistering speed of a sloth on vacation, somewhere between 20 and 39 mph, and for this high-octane thrill ride, they bleed you dry. That's right, they liberate $100 of your hard-earned in-game currency for every 10 in-game minutes they spend at the wheel. At this rate, they'd drive any player into bankruptcy faster than you can say ""Farming Simulator 22""!

And would it kill them to animate a door opening? We've mastered teleportation in FS22 – a feat yet unachieved in the real world, mind you – because you simply phase into your tractor's cab. Meanwhile, community modders have done what seems impossible for the devs, making walk-around interiors a reality!

And then, there's the infamous 'Black Sky Bug'. Picture this: after two or three wonderful farming sessions, the once clear blue sky turns pitch black - both day and night. It's like you've been suddenly transported to a parallel universe where physics doesn't exist, and neither do the wheels of your vehicles. You'll find yourself operating a fleet of floating machinery. The trains? They pull a Houdini on you. Even the hardest-working farmer can't load an invisible train!

Now, the process to fix this would make a NASA engineer break into a cold sweat: first, you must perform a ritual of deleting save files, then exorcise your system of the game and its DLCs. After a couple of computer restarts sprinkled in for good measure, you have to cleanse your computer's cache. Once all this is done, it's time to download everything again like you're living your very own Groundhog Day. Seriously, did I sign up to be a farmer or an IT technician?

Last but not least, a shout-out to the game's support team for their unresponsiveness. I reported this black sky, vehicle tires disappearing bug back in September 2022. It’s July 2023 now, and I'm still waiting. Hey, at least it’s comforting to know that the simulated farming world is just as full of delays and ignored messages as the real one. 

All in all, Farming Simulator 22 is a worthwhile venture for both seasoned and novice virtual farmers, offering hours of unique, engaging gameplay that will keep you hooked, despite its occasional hiccups.

10/31/2023:
And of course, when I decided to give it another whirl, the devs had zapped away the WindowedFullscreen option. Marvelous! So now my options are squinting at a window the size of a postage stamp, or going full screen and playing digital whack-a-mole with my windows every time I dare to multitask. It's like choosing between a flat tire and running out of gas – either way, you're not going anywhere fast. Let's just say, it adds a whole new level of 'challenge' to the game – one I never signed up for.

And then, as if by some dark magic, full-screen mode turns my in-game camera into a carnival ride. Swinging it to the right summons a ghostly cursor, which I was pretty sure was a myth, to play pinball on the screen edges, effectively putting my camera moves on timeout. As if that wasn't enough of a throwback, my fancy Legion Lenovo 5i has decided to cosplay as a vintage computer, stuttering like it's trying to communicate via Morse code and ditching anti-aliasing like a bad habit. Meanwhile, my once-crisp 5K visuals have devolved into a nostalgic pixel art exhibit. Ah, the ""good"" old days!

Also, the game's support team still has not responded.",1688630383,1698816928,False,23,10,0.616352081298828125,0,True,False,False

The physics are the worse than farming sim 2013 and the AI farmer follow suit with the trend.
Graphics are no different to 2019 maybe even worse, game still has all the stupid bugs. DONT EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THE AI TRAFFIC. its simply just a money grab and a pathetic rebrand of the old titles, stick to whatever farming sim you unfortunately own right now and get mods to make up for the lack of content.

Currently sitting at 685 hours of game time without mods

Pros:
Wide selection of farming equipment and attachments for said equipment from various manufacturers like Massey Ferguson, Claas, Fendt. Pottinger.
AI Makes taking care of many fields a blast
Machinery sounds like it would IRL
You can Boycott John Deere and never have to use a single thing from them without ruining your game play or limiting it
A month into one save and i barely managed to own all the farm plots
Contracts are amazing and help pad the pocket and cut out idle time.
It has snow and snow plows.

Cons:
It has the simulator wonkyness that come with most other ""simulators""
John Deere Equipment
The AI is well AI and will derp about.
the AI will miss spots on your farm if objects are close to the field

There are alot of people dogging on this game for just being another repeat - which it is. I have to agree with this. But also remember the fact there's a ton of new features and polishing with this. This game feels like a whole different franchise just from the polishing. There isn't random clipping textures, holes in equipment, 144p looking wear textures on equipment.. This game looks good. Like really good. Though if I'm honest this game is what 19 needed to be.

Big features with this version are the addition of built in seasons which you can customize to your liking, and while it may not be Realismus seasons, it's pretty damn good. I really enjoy playing with it. Also the maps have tons of live features now, so for example when a new DLC is approaching the billboards and signs start showing info for that DLC, and during seasons, you'll see barbecues in the summer, halloween deco in October, and snowmen/Christmas deco in December. It's a really nice addition, and finally the maps feel like they have some life. As for the maps themselves, you have Elmcreek which is based in the Midwest region of the USA, hard to place exactly where but I would say Iowa/Indiana/Illinois area, just based on the overall area. There is also a french map, that I think is pretty bland and disappointing, and I couldn't say where it's based but I would say it's the western part. There is also Erlengrat which is a Swiss map from FS19's Alpine DLC. It's the exact same map and while I love playing on it, it does have some FPS issues and can be very confusing if you don't understand the concept of the map.

Next we move onto equipment. Here's where it gets wild. The brands they brought into this release, among small things everybody has wanted, is insane. There has to be a minimum of 25 new brands in this game and at least 100 new machines not counting any DLC. It's truly insane the equipment selection in this game. There's some weak points, like mid size seeders and cultivators, but there's ways around it. You of course have plenty of mods, or you can stick with smaller stuff and just deal with the extra time taken. I do a mix of both. There's some tractors that have US and EU spec options, all crawler tractors and harvesters have 3D tracks, interiors are fully animated.. There's an insane jump in this version that 19 doesn't have. Yes 19 had some stupid nice tractors but not all. You could see the recycled stuff compared to the new stuff, in this version even the recycled equipment has all the up to date features. It's truly another level of attention to detail. Not to mention loaders and such now make a bang when lowered fully, new hydraulic sounds, new attach sounds.. And don't forget manual transmissions. While the implementation of manuals is pretty garbage, it's still one more thing this game was severely lacking in older versions. It's only weird on some vehicles, on some it works fine. All in all having this feature in the base game is a huge jump even if it's implemented terribly.

In terms of the farming aspect, it's pretty much the same, however there are some small differences. With Seasons enabled, you can only plant and harvest in certain months of the year, which adds just a little more realism. Crop growth is no longer randomized. It takes a set amount of months to grow whether you have Seasons on or off. For example wheat takes 10 months, and potatoes take 5. The plant/harvest chart reflects this. Turning off the seasons just makes it where you plant whenever and harvest whenever. There is also parallox occlusion mapping, which makes anything rows look 3D even though they aren't. While it may not be as good as true 3D ground, it looks extremely nice. There are also grape vines and olive groves now, and the respective equipment to harvest these. They are annoying, but fun. There are no new animals in this version. Aside from these it's pretty much the same old farming system from 19.

Now on to landscaping and build mode. The landscaping mode remains mostly unchanged from FS19 aside from being way more polished and working a whole lot better, among new ground materials. Foliage and ground are separated, and you can do some truly wild stuff through the landscaping tool. As for build mode, this is a new addition that effectively took the Placeables menu and turned it into it's own mode. There's a ton of new lists and menus, you can place almost anything. Fences, animal pens, decorations, productions.. Almost anything you can place, and if you don't find it there, guaranteed there's a mod for it. You can literally build a map from bare nothing if you want using just the build and terrain tools. It's pretty cool.

Coming to the end you have stuff such as the modhub, crossplay support, multiplayer, and other finishing touches. The multiplayer is an absolute disaster. I'm not talking in people, I'm talking the server side. It's been pretty broken since the game's release, and only minimal improvements over time. They consolidated the 6 individual servers down to 1 massive server, and on busy days, forget MP entirely. It overloads in no time flat, and if you do get in, have fun staying in. It's a DISASTER. As for the in game modhub, not much is changed, though you no longer have to restart after getting mods, they just automatically install and you're all set. There's a good selection of mods, both PC only and crossplay, and that brings us to crossplay. You can play with someone on a console, from PC, as long as you have matching CROSSPLAY mods. Not just any mod is crossplay, only certain ones are. Because consoles are so limited on space and licensing, only non licensed (and brands already in-game) are allowed. This will never be changed. If you want a bunch of cool modded stuff, buy a PC and do the game the right way. Consoles are NOT meant for this type of game.

All in all, this game is a 7/10. There are a ton of good features about it, it's extremely stable and seems to just work all times unlike the last 2 versions, and there are a few bad features. The biggest thing to me is I feel like a lot of the features of this should have been for FS19 and in this version they should've focused on 3D ground, more realistic harvesting, more crops and other things people have been asking about for years. But maybe the next iteration will have a few of these. Though this is a healthy addition, and while 19 was a ton of fun and I enjoyed it, this is a MUCH more polished game. 19 was constantly crashing, full of broken equipment, missing textures, bugged maps and more. This one has hardly any bugs. Even when it released almost everything worked, and within 2 weeks the game had no bugs. The only real issue is the multiplayer, but it works if you understand when to use it for a good experience. All in all this game is a very polished and fun to play game. The price tag is a little high, but it is worth it. The attention to detail in this version is worth the extra money. You won't notice it until you play but they went over the top with details on everything. It's pretty awesome.

Hope this was a helpful review that talks someone into this game. I know I've gotten my moneys worth and will continue to do so. This is a really good game in the series. Let's hope the next one is even better.",1697217571,1697217571,True,99,2,0.871646761894226074,0,True,False,False

(Summary at bottom)
NOT a reskinned FS19. I have about 650 hours on FS19 and I can most certainly say this is much better in many ways, and many things have been completely overhauled. 

- Sounds have had a major overhaul, makes the game feel more realistic and immersive.
- A few minor realism additions, like visual gear-shifting, cab suspension, etc.
- More placeables than ever, including sheds with working doors, refuel stations, seed & fert tanks, etc. Fences, lights, and other decor too, to brighten up your farm a bit.
- Many new brands, and more tire brand options. Also license plates for equipment and vehicles.
- Character customization. Imo, not the best, graphics and general proportions look weird, but hey, better than before.
- Better organized XML files. Much more easier on the eyes compared to FS17, and easier to find things such as the money value. I don't need to use ctrl+f anymore, I can just scroll. (Speaking of XML editing, instead of editing the careerSavegame.xml file like FS17 & FS19 to edit your cash, here you need to edit farms.xml file instead in the same folder, careerSavegame.xml is only for appearance in the main menu.)
- Better organized shop UI, not to mention the UI overall. Imo, the weird blue fade on the speedometer/tachometer reminds me of those old games, and I wish they had just instead updated the FS19 one.
- An actual American-based map. Major improvement from Ravenport and Goldcrest Valley, feels more of the true american countryside thanks to that new office here in the U.S. that Giants got a while ago.
- Buying used equipment. Great for starting a farm on a tight budget, and in multiplayer you can buy other farm's sold vehicles. Wish there was more than 5 at a time though.
- Vehicle gearbox. Not required if you don't want to use it, but I like it. A wee bit confusing at times however, I'm used to the way you shift in American Truck Simulator, but this is different. Not bad, maybe needs to be tweaked a bit. Will note that it's sometimes buggy, especially with mods.
- Obviously graphics, you won't really notice a huge jump between FS19 and FS22 as the major jump of the franchise was between FS17 and FS19, but there are some noticeable changes. Also, 3D tracks on tractors. No more jpeg tracks.
- Seasons. I don't like playing so realistic to the point I have to wait time for the proper planting and harvesting time, but there's an option to make it so the seasons are just visual only. 
- Multiplayer Voice Chat, very useful.

Now, there are of course many bugs with the game, and some features missing since it got released not too long ago. 

Some rather aggravating bugs/missing features are:
- Landscaping, a tad bit annoying with the camera and movement. There's no snapping things to a certain rotation, and the camera angle is from a bird's eye view that swoops down instead of zooming in, which is rather annoying when trying to line things up together. There's also no sprinting like in FS17 (idk about the others)
- AI workers. We all know from previous FS games that the AI is notorious, especially in FS17. Here, there have been some improvements, and with the addition of AI being able to drive vehicles to and fro, that's really useful, but again, very buggy. The classic 'Helper F is blocked by an object!' pops up every now and then, you tab over and there's nothing in it's way. Lately, on modded maps, the AI sometimes will just sit there doing nothing. Possibly just a mod-side issue. 
- Buildings, most notably the farmhouse. If you look into the windows, it's just a copied .jpeg of a weird looking kitchen with yellow cabinets and a granite looking wall. I'm sure Giants will add in an interior at some point, I don't want jpeg interiors like FS13 & FS17. Also, you cannot interact with/enter any existing buildings/sheds/barns on the farms on the land you purchase. I sure hope that gets changed.(note: kinda sorta fixed? some sheds you can enter)

Bugs TL;DR:
- Landscaping (Controls & viewing angles are awkward)
- AI Driving/Transport (Blocked by nothing, drives the wrong path or drives in circles')
- didn't note this but general physics, collisions, and the gearbox still need to be tuned.

TL;DR:

There are many bugs, I hope they'll be fixed before the next year. But there are also many improvements from previous FS games, as someone who's played FS13 (Xbox 360), 17 (Steam), and 19 (Epic Games).

At this time, with the amount of bugs/missing features in the game, you can go ahead and buy it if you want. I managed to snag a deal with the season passes where I got both for like $30, damn good deal, would NOT recommend paying full price for each individual DLC.

I have not tested everything, and I have not played every map. I do not have all of the bugs and missing features listed, I will update this review as I come across more notable bugs, missing features, and changes from previous FS games.

Again, this is a newly released game, so unless Giants decides to not fix these issues/keep them removed like EA did with Battlefield 2042, then I will change this review as needed.

11/24/21 Update

So you can use Q & E to switch between the license plate types, yet when you're typing in your custom license plate and you need to press Q or E, it switches the license plate type. They do have an on-screen keyboard I assume for consoles, but I really don't want to *click, move mouse (repeat 8 more times)* every single time I have to put in a license plate. My way to bypass this is make sure the color selection is highlighted when you start typing.

The field care addon is nice, more stuff to do with Grain farming. I haven't really played around with that yet.

Graphics for working the fields look much better, but when the field state changes (harvested to cultivated, to plowed, etc) is still very noticeable and jittery, a bit annoying as it is ruining the immersion a little.

Pallet physics have improved a ton, however, but they do still slide around imo a wee bit too easily.

Bigbags! Can easily pick them up with anything with forks, and you can feel that you're picking up a heavy item. They have realistic physics, so that's nice.

12/31/21 Update

- Pre-Placed Buildings can now be deleted off of farms.
- The issue with the semi truck axles acting weird is now fixed. They drive much smoother now.

4/12/22 Update:

- Character customization is saved to the last customized option.
- License Plates are also saved the same way.
- Updated/revised entire review

9/9/22 Update:

Revised entire review again, clarified some things, and removed some stuff that didn't need to be here to make room because of the damn review character limit.

10/11/23 Update:

Fine tuned the review a little bit, moved a few notable things from previous updates to the main category, blablabla. I don't think I can do much more for this review, especially with the character limit.",1637642784,1697039713,True,251,7,0.912825644016265869,18,True,False,False

I mean the game has a long legacy and this game just checks all marks for a quadruple A game, cus' it's better than a lot of other more expensive triple A games. If you are a fan of Farming Simulator I do recommend the Premium Edition bundle since you get most DLCs for less than usual. If you just started I recommend just the regular base game or trying one of the older games if your not sure you want to pay 40-60 for this one. But it's fun, relaxing, and enjoyable to play with friends and other people from across the world. If you're a fan of logging you also have Platinum which is Silverrun, a haven for lumber lovers. If you like classic farming that mods got you there. You have all of the classic brands like John Deere, Kubota (DLC), and even Michelin!

 TL;DR, Buy it if you love the series or want something fun, relaxing, and enjoyable! Along with all of the classic farming brands like John Deere, Kubota(DLC), and many more that you will for sure have fun playing along with.",1696700344,1696700344,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Edit* - I have quite a few issues with this game and the fact that Giant's has turned a blind eye to each of these. 
- Multiplayer servers are a pain to get set up and running correctly. I didn't have many issues last year but recently, the savegames I've set up are not populating correctly for people to join and/or doesnt show up in a timely manner (45 minutes+ to show up with constant refresh)
- Cannot directly connect to a server IP so it makes it time consuming just to host a game for friends to play on. I don't know why this isn't a feature since so many people have requested it. Giant's refuses to implement this. 
- I've had a bug since day one with refilling units. I need to disconnect and reconnect the implement to get the refill option to show. Two different computers, mod free and modded, fresh installation of game. Seems like I'm not the only one and those bug reports have gone unanswered.

First and foremost, the graphics in Farming Simulator 22 are stunning. The attention to detail in the landscapes, crops, and machinery is truly impressive. Whether it's the way the sun sets over your fields or the realistic weather effects, every aspect of the game is visually appealing and contributes to the immersive farming experience.

The gameplay itself is incredibly satisfying. Managing your farm, planting and harvesting crops, tending to livestock, and expanding your operations is both challenging and enjoyable. The addition of new crops and the ability to produce and sell various products adds depth to the gameplay, keeping you engaged for hours on end.

One of the standout features of Farming Simulator 22 is the extensive selection of machinery and equipment. With a wide range of tractors, combines, plows, and other vehicles at your disposal, you have the tools needed to customize your farm and work efficiently. The realism in how these machines handle and function adds a layer of authenticity that farming enthusiasts will appreciate.

The game also offers a great multiplayer mode, allowing you to collaborate with friends in building and managing your virtual farms. It's a fantastic way to experience the joys and challenges of farming together, making it a social experience that can be both fun and educational.

The developers have listened to the feedback from the community and have made significant improvements in Farming Simulator 22, making it more accessible and enjoyable for both newcomers and long-time fans of the series. The tutorial system is comprehensive, making it easier for newcomers to get started, while the experienced players will still find plenty of depth and challenge.

In conclusion, Farming Simulator 22 is an outstanding simulation game that offers a truly authentic and enjoyable farming experience. With its stunning graphics, realistic gameplay, extensive machinery options, and multiplayer capabilities, it's a game that keeps you coming back for more. Whether you're a farming enthusiast or just looking for a unique and relaxing gaming experience, I wholeheartedly recommend giving Farming Simulator 22 a try.

From the moment you enter the multiplayer mode, it's clear that this game's online experience was designed by someone who has never played a multiplayer game in their life.

First off, the matchmaking system is an exercise in frustration. It seems to have a mind of its own, often pairing you with players who have vastly different objectives or playstyles. Want to focus on efficient farming and cooperation? Tough luck! You'll end up with a group of trolls who sabotage your efforts, turning your virtual farm into a chaotic mess.

The lag in multiplayer is mind-boggling. You'd think that in this day and age, a game could handle a few players on a virtual farm without constant stuttering and disconnections. But no, expect to spend more time watching loading screens and dealing with lag spikes than actually enjoying the game.

Communication with other players is another disaster. There's no in-game voice chat, which means you're stuck typing messages in a clunky chat box while trying to harvest your crops or tend to your livestock. It's a recipe for frustration and miscommunication.

Overall, Farming Simulator's multiplayer system is a complete and utter mess. If you value your sanity and want a cooperative farming experience, look elsewhere. This game's multiplayer is nothing short of a steaming pile of manure.

However, I have requested a refund.  In just under 2 hours I discovered that the in-game AI helpers do not work with any consistency. In the Elmcreek map 2 of the first 3 fields (the ones you get as a beginning farmer) would not work with the AI helper seeding the field.  They would start (sometimes) and then stop at the end of the first pass sown the field.  I'd start them again driving the first little bit and then hired the helper (as some have suggested as a fix). They might go two passes back and forth and then would stop again.  I speculated that CoursePlay might work instead of using the base game AI hired workers but was running out of time to try this before 2 hour limit expired for refund.  However, even if CP worked you should not have to use a mod or a work around to use a very basic and important feature of the base game.  And I know that the AI helpers may not always work perfectly. On the various forums used by players I found many comments about this problem so this has been a known issue for a long time. This feature is such a part of my basic game play that I would have been frustrated over and over again with it not working. This should have been fixed years ago.  Maybe it would be better to work on known bugs rather than DLC's...  I hate to leave a negative review on a game I've enjoyed for so many hours over lots of years but people need to know this feature in this game may not work as expected.",1695169117,1695169117,False,5,0,0.517821669578552246,0,True,False,False

Game is playable... But sooo much better with bunch of mods(a lot of mods and Reshade), like realism and grid snap, extend lights etc.. lots of QOL mods out there.( and only reason i keep playing because of mods)

Vanilla game is.. an arcady stuff( but u got to keep excel spreadsheet), and there is more than one way to cheese(create new farm and transfer all money), no real goal or challenge even on hard( this changes with some mods that make it a lot harder and more punishing to do stupid or shortcut things). I did not encounter many bugs, but a lot of ""why can't I do this!?"" like empty water tank anywhere, not wrap grass bales, add only little to TMR mixer, etc...

Simulation( as in the title lol):
No dew in mornings, no moisture consideration or quality of the crop. Only thing is that you get less which is not always the case, you get low quality but the same amount and then it requires further processing. no clogging of machines, no breakdown. Could talk more about harvesting in high humidity, but whats the point... There is ""maintenance"" but its not realistic even on hard setting: you cant plow whole day without changing plow heads as they become dull and are eaten away by erosion. There are high quality more expensive ""original"" pieces and cheap black market knockoffs, but nothing like that in game. No storms or wildlife that destroys your crop.
Plow: lower it and drive like a car, no problem doing circles or turning 180... totally broken.
Manual gears/hp/torque: load your little tractor with massive trailer, put in the top gear, and just drive away like its nothing... i guess infinite torque/power or some kind of magical gear box...  try doing that on a real tractor lol. There should be ""enable simulation"" for the non arcade gamers.
 Then again average Joe would not like it and it would be ""too complicated"" and hence this is very basic ""on the surface simulation"" without much depth, more like to teach kids what is farm and where milk comes from. ( Source: retired farm boi)

Graphics:
Only tractors,attachments look OK( and you can scale them to 200% 3D resolution... why?!), looks like you put high poly tractor and throw it on low poly world, pretty much it. View range( lod,details,shadows) is barely ok when maxed out and playing exclusively from cabin first person view. There seems to be no ambient light at all in world? no occlusion so shadows look ""cheap"" and gives it 2000s feel(for a game in 2022...) The sky is either burning depths inferno or just weird not fitting overblown bright. I guess they tried to focus on beautiful sunset/sunrise with minimal effort, but ended up with creepy plastic surgery fail face equivalent. There seems to be no atmosphere either, no heat rising, you can see 999999999km without any deterioration of vision in 31C in hot summer day... No depth of field either. The map borders look so low poly that I think im playing Doom 95...
The rain is there, but you don't see it interacting with anything like the front glass or water... The sounds is quite good for thunder, but never seen lightning :(

World visuals was clearly not top or even middle of their prio list. I hope they ditch this engine and make new game in UE5 with better LOD,shadows,distance etc.


Economy:
Hoard and sell at high price or feed drip. Has some production chains, some pay a lot, some are totally not worth it like some oils production.
Borrow and repay $$ only with increments of 5k. want to borrow 200k? clickfest!
Many ways to cheeze money.

Multiplayer:
At least it works, with some weird rubber banding that is tied to fps??? if the host is experiencing fps drop for whatever reason ,you as client, will gain turbo nitro on your tractor and, well, hope you are going straight line and there is no water/ditch and you are not carrying full load... The listing of servers appears usually after few minutes of clicking back and forward ""join multiplayer game"" and ""back to menu"", because they couldn't figure out how to implement ""refresh server list""

On the same topic: WTF IS UP WITH ""SYNCING WITH OTHER PLAYERS"" when someone joins a server and everything is frozen for 3 minutes lol. Never heard of async calls? Imagine WoW gets frozen everytime someone joins the server, or CoD or Destiny, or any other fricking online game gets frozen for new client to sync with other players LOL LOL LOL. This would never get trough code review if I was checking it...

Building:
""collides with another object"" that is invisible so FU! go get place anywhere mod and be done with it, but it does not work with grapes...
Want to remove rocks/boulders from your field? Pay up and get DLC... And even then you can not remove all of them.

Grapes:
can only ""extend"" them downhill or on flat, so no making beautiful hill vineyard...

Logging:
eh logs are hard to pick up because the ground does not deform, aka you cant scoop them up. The claws are funny... they bend backwards and all kinds of rubbery madness. stay away from logging unless you enjoy trailers that are possessed and move on their own and logs flying/yeeting you in the air.

Bales stacking:
if you fancy picking the bales with tractor( and not autoloaders), you got to be very precise. The bales do not act like bales, but some rubbery bouncy objects.Way too much bounce. Booped the bale? whole stack is jiggling and vibrating and about to fly to space.

Harvesting:
Any attachment attaches to any combine: smallest engine and 15m header looks silly :D
same with tractor attachments. At some point tractor hp comes in to play. 

Precison farming DLC(free):
With this dlc some equipment becomes obsolete( even before this DLC), Some game-play loops become punishing(plowing, cultivating) so you got to opt out for least work and most combo machines. 

I would like to see more QoL, graphical improvements and balancing for it to be worth full price.",1693126592,1694846626,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have played almost exclusively on the Steam Deck, and while it runs pretty well, there are extremely frustrating ""micro stutters"" quite often, so much so that I had to stop playing because they bugged me. I assumed this was due to weaker hardware, but it does the exact same thing on the gaming PC I just built (AMD 6700XT, 32GB RAM) and have seen enough people with the same issue online that it must be some lack of optimization within the game. My only other complaint is that the vehicle steering needs some more customizability to make it enjoyable on a gamepad. It's extremely jerky because the wheel just turns instantaneously in response to the joysticks - there needs to be some ""weight"" to it. The ability to set some speed and/or snapback limits would be great - SnowRunner does a good job of making the steering have some feel and weight to it that this game lacks and it makes the tractor driving and truck driving a lot less fun than it could be.",1693221240,1693221240,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Farming Simulator offers an immersive and surprisingly engaging experience for players looking to dive into the world of agriculture. With its attention to detail and commitment to realism, this game provides an authentic farming simulation that can captivate both veterans of the genre and newcomers alike. While not without its flaws, Farming Simulator manages to cultivate a rewarding gaming experience that keeps players coming back for more.

Gameplay: The core gameplay mechanics of Farming Simulator are its strongest selling points. The simulation is meticulously crafted, allowing players to engage in a wide array of farming activities from plowing and planting to harvesting and animal husbandry. The variety of crops, machinery, and equipment available is impressive, and the satisfaction of watching your virtual farm thrive is truly gratifying. The controls are intuitive, making it accessible to players of all skill levels. However, some actions may feel a bit monotonous after extended gameplay, which prevents a perfect score.

Realism and Immersion: Farming Simulator excels in delivering a remarkably realistic experience. The attention to detail in both the farming processes and the environments is commendable. The changing seasons, day-night cycle, and dynamic weather patterns not only affect the gameplay but also contribute to the immersive ambiance. The level of authenticity in how crops grow, animals behave, and machinery operates adds an educational aspect to the game that's both entertaining and informative.

Graphics and Sound: While the visuals in Farming Simulator are generally solid, they don't necessarily push the boundaries of modern gaming technology. The landscapes and machinery are well-designed and realistic, but some textures and character animations could benefit from further refinement. The sound design, particularly the ambient sounds of the farm and the hum of the machinery, enhance the immersion, but the overall soundtrack could use more variety.

Content and Progression: Farming Simulator offers a significant amount of content to explore, from various types of crops to a wide selection of machinery. The game encourages players to expand their farms, manage resources efficiently, and maximize profits. However, some players might find the progression a bit slow-paced, especially during the early stages of the game. More guidance or goal-setting options could help keep players engaged and motivated.

Community and Mods: One of Farming Simulator's strongest assets is its dedicated community of players and modders. The game's modding support allows players to customize and expand their experience significantly. From adding new crops and equipment to altering gameplay mechanics, the modding community breathes new life into the game regularly, enhancing its replayability and longevity.

Final Verdict:
Farming Simulator offers an immersive and engaging farming simulation experience that stands out due to its attention to realism and its supportive modding community. While the graphics and some gameplay aspects could use a bit more polish, the overall package delivers a rewarding and educational journey into the world of agriculture. Whether you're a seasoned virtual farmer or new to the genre, Farming Simulator offers a fruitful gaming experience worthy of a 4/5 star rating.",1692622440,1692622440,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

10 out 10~ Would upset the fascists again.

Honest review, It has some nice features that put it above Farm sim 19.  The addition of more crops was a bonus, and the production aspect is a whole new creature.  I'd be enjoying it even more if I hadnt had to put up with a lecture of why I ""needed to accept conditioning through propaganda is for my own good.""  

Buy the game, but try to avoid such mor.... Individuals, if you can

EDIT:  8/20/2023
Four days later, and a rant by another individual was put up on the same discussion I was told I could no longer comment on because I violated their ""Off topic content rules"".  It started out ""Imagine being so petty....."" attacking someone who disagreed with some of the things being talked about and decided to comment.

Will GIANTS enforce their rules evenly across the board and ban that individual as well?  I doubt it, as it doesnt look like they enforced it against the one from before either.

I am sorry but if I have to pause the game every 5 minutes to watch YouTube tutorial on how to play it it is not worth it...",1692563416,1692563416,False,0,0,0.436507940292358398,0,True,False,False

I feel that I can no longer buy from or support this developer and would recommend for anybody reading this review to dig a little deeper into the reviews for the season pass and make the decision yourself, already feels like a money grab to me hope this helps.

PS i enjoyed/played FS 19 and purchased it as a test to see if 22 was worth the price

P.S. i have revisited seems that the season pass isnt so bad but,  the game is as before and runs great, Untell you try and play Multi play,  then its like trying to play on a dial up Modem from the 1990s come guys you can do better than 56k dial up for your server hosting, how do u expect people to give great reviews if you are being so cheep, wake up it 2023!!!

I do not recomend for multi play even if you pay for a server but game itself is better since my original review.  Get the dlc in the premium expansion and have a great game that is fairly resonable now.",1666918785,1692468279,True,0,0,0.524511337280273438,0,True,False,False

If you have played any previous Farming Simulator from this developer then you should really know what to expect and I suggest you read the ""whats new"" section of my review.


[b][u]Introduction[/u][/b]

This is a relaxing simulation about one of the hardest jobs in the world, and I am not saying that to win favour with the real farming community, it genuinely does seem difficult. We have mods and other controls that can enhance our experience, I am sure a real farmer would love the ability to pick up an entire pallet of seeds with their bare hands, or just rock up next to a big bag and press the ""r"" button to fill their equipment, but instead they have to do it properly, using forks to lift these things up, angle it over the hoppers and feed it in without spilling any...

So lets get that out the way, this is a game and should not be compared to real farming, however it does use real world tools and equipment (some are flights of fantasy if you delve into mods - more on that later). It tries to give you a geniune but fun experience.

This game is not without its challenges and this is what makes it appealing to me, there is no real ""end goal"" only what you set out, which I do recommend you do to give you some reason to play.. like for example have a certain amount of money in the bank? own all the map? run a self efficient farm with animals where you produce your own feed and productions? A mixture of all or whatever.

An example of my average gameplay is to start with minimum equipment, low funds, a small plot of land and have to start my own empire from nothing, either relying on expensive loans or working for other people.

This game does include various elements that can make the game more realistic or just easier whatever you fancy, for example are you going to worry about crop destruction? running over fields could ruin your harvest and take away any profits? Are you going to worry about plowing the fields, every now and then you may need to ""reset"" the soil before the next seeding or it will ruin the next yeild, weeds? Are you going to have to worry about these getting in the way of the crops? And the Precision Farming DLC which adds a whole new level of field management and I can't play without it.

Its a game you can jump into and then forget for a while and still remember why you love it. Sure its not for everyone but if you are here on this page you are either here because you are generally interested or just here to troll like its a new thing.

Fact is this game can be enjoyable even if you have little to no interest in farming, watch some youtubers completly wreck this game (GrayStillPlays done one on FS19 and I found it funny, he seemed to enjoy it) and that brings me onto the next topic... the Mods..


[b][u]Modding capabilities[/u][/b]

This game survives on Mods, there is an official ModHub in game that is home to literally thousands of mods of various equipment, maps and gameplay scripts. They could help or hinder your gameplay and without the mods this game can get pretty boring fast... That being said, I do recommend you play without mods first of all so you get to know the basics, then start introducing mods as you play.

Some mods I would recommend are:

Better Contracts
Contracts+
VIP Contracts
Easy Development Controls
Lumberjack
Shop Sales Customiser

These will help you in your gameplay and give you better rewards and other perks when completing contracts (or again hinder them) like you can make it that you can only start borrowing equipment when doing contracts when you have completed some jobs for that farmer, or you can earn a discount on field purchases the more jobs you do for them? The choice is all yours.

There are so many mods out there and I suggest you try them out rather than asking people what they would suggest.
There are new productions (again more on that later) modded productions, lots of different vehicles and tools, some are just for fun (The Flintstones car for example) and others are just mad (a small combine with a tank that is 5x too big for it)

And finally Maps... Its maps that you want in this game you start off with a few maps that are fine, however you may get bored with these soon enough, the fact that there are always maps being released for this game means there is always something for everyone, they range from small farms, to massive or even empty lands where you got to develop it from the ground up (try ""No Mans Land"") to massive forrestry maps where you have to clear out before you can start doing any other farming.

Precision Farming - official DLC, this can take your game to a whole new level, however its not for everyone and may take some time getting used to it, but once you do, you might not go back.


[b][u]So Whats New[/u][/b]

As I previously stated if you played any previous farming simulators then most of this review wont appeal to you, but you want to know what sets this apart. 

First of all it must be stated that a lot of these ""new"" features aren't exactly ""new"" they have been available in previous versions as Mods from the community, but we are discussing that they are now part of the base game and don't require any other mods (although you can download mods to change them up if needs be)

first of all is the inclusion of Seasons, this is the first time it has been ""as standard"" in a Farm Sim game and its been done pretty well, again if you have used Seasons in a previous game this won't be that new to you, but it is how it sounds, the weather will change throughout the year, and you have a crop calender which determines what can be planted and when it can be harvested.

Its basic but still enjoyable, and can make a challenge if you don't plan your crop rotations correctly, so youre not standing around doing nothing. Seasons can run as little to 1 day per month, to 30 days per month, I personally would only run around 3 days per month, unless you are running a massive farm with a lot to do, but you can change this and even turn it on and off whenever you want.


And then there are Production Chains, again something that was a mod in previous versions, but this is now as standard, before in the base game you send your product to a sell point make money, rince and repeat, now you can buy or setup your own productions, and make a final product, for example you take your grain to a mill, turn it into flour, take that flour to a bakery, with milk and butter, and strawberries from the greenhouses and it can make cakes. Its no lie.

[b][u]Final Verdict[/u][/b]

Its not for everyone sure but then what game is? But it is more enjoyable and addictive than you might think, if you get hooked you will get hooked. It has a great community, that are constantly modding and supporting this game, and there are some multiplayer benefits (I haven't tried the multiplayer aspects but I am sure they are fun). I would wait for the Premium edition to be released before buying it (at time of writing this August 2023). And it is available on GamePass..

Also the stuttering you get at the start, is normal, just power through it, things will get better I promise, don't mess with settings just power through it, you can do it.",1691929847,1691929847,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am glad that it was probably a bug or misunderstanding that previously prevented the purchase, which has now been fixed. It's very good that the developers solved the problem and took care of their fans.
In November there will be another DLC, with a map from Central Europe and new crops and vehicles that I am very much looking forward to. The map is included in Season Pass 2.

(OLD: I don't know if it's a mistake or greed of the developers, but it's pathetic that during the sale, people who want to buy FS22 for the first time have the opportunity to buy the bundle of the base game+SeasonPass1+SP2 (PLN 170.64zl) at a significant discount, and for a person who purchased the game at launch, it is not possible to purchase this bundle.
Ultimately, it turns out that someone who already owns the game must spend the same amount on a single Seasons Pass 1 (PLN 171.99zl) or SP2 (PLN 171.99zl) as a person who is just buying the bundle - base game+SP1+SP2 (PLN 170.64zl).
This is how developers care about their fans and treat players who buy the game for the premiere.
It's sad and pathetic. I will not write about the fact that FS22 is the same as FS18.)",1688232952,1691159228,True,0,0,0.593374729156494141,0,True,False,False

And while I was annoyed by how fs19 dlc was handled, when those of us that supported the developer and purchased the game and some DLC along the way as they were released got no bundle rebate on steam (for parts of bundle we already own), nothing come close to how Giants are treating your customers with the Platinum Edition crap they are pulling this time around. 

A new player getting into the game now can get the FS22 Premium edition, getting the base game and both season passes including platinum expansion for 40 Euro.  This is a good deal, I'm not complaining about this, it's a fair price for this late in the game lifecycle. 

But if I, with the base game, try to purchase Premium Edition on steam I get the following message: 
[i]Farming Simulator 22: Premium Edition
You already own some of the items in this bundle. This offer is only available when buying all items at the same time.[/i]

So, according to Steam and how [b]Giants [/b]spesifically asked them to set the pricing.. 
Me wanting to get the full experience of FS22, having already paid 40 euro for the base when it came out, now have to pay 40 euro for year 1 season pass and 40 euro for year 2 pass. An additional 80 euro, a total of 120, instead of 40, just because I dared to buy the base game when it came out.

I get and agree on giving a bundle price for new players late to the game, giving a good value bundle price to entice them to the franchise. 
But you can do so without shitting over your existing players and tell them to go buy everything at full price just because they had the gall to purchase the game when it came out and wait for dlc to release. 

You price it as if you only have 2 types of customers, those that buy base game + season passes right as they come out (this is fine, they get content as it rolls out, ignoring the dlc outside of season pass issue), and those that buy into the game at the end of the game development, and only wants to because a heavy discount. 

Sure I could try and buy Premium Edition as a gift and claim it for myself, again getting no value for my existing purchase of the base game.
But having to circumvent steam store just to get the bundle price is ridiculous, not to mention most people don't know how steam handles gifted bundles when you own an item in that bundle already, just having to gamble that it works. 

At a minimum give me the option to buy the same editions as new players have, direct in Steam, there is no reason at all to lock that option from existing players.  

But preferably let existing owned items be deducted from the bundle base cost, with the same bundle discount applied for remaining items. 
Like [b]EVERY [/b]other developer is doing! 

Get your act together Giants!


I get that I'm most likely screaming into the void, but I for one is never going to buy a new FS game until the ""final"" premium bundle is out unless this changes, if at all.

I also think that the landscaping system needs an entire revamp. i understand that in 2019 the landscaping aspect was new and awaited to be perfected. Its so hard to sculpt land. i also thing that the leveling process for placing down sheds needs a good revamp as well. i don't like that the land becomes a hard square part of ground that comes up. I think it should be fixed into a piece of concrete that adjusts to what it needs to be leveled at. But in all honesty this game is top tier and i cant wait for the upcoming ones and its worth the $40",1691014181,1691014181,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

but if u like small farms.  lots of repetitive things.  animals, farming etc.  this can be for you then.  it just depends on ur style.  personally i would think Ranch Simulator would be better for those people though.  imo this game just missed on all aspects.  excelled no where and came up short on everything.  

I like fs 17 best.  19 was ok.....22 went down hill hard for me.  The ai was supposed to be better.  but instead was worse.  at least for staying in fields.  yes it was cool to have trips set to call and or send vehicles around the base game maps.  but it was only for base game maps.  which i hate all base maps.....  so small, tight european setting.  

i like the big 4x square maps.  open roads with room for 45ft headers not hitting trees, etc.  to me fs22 feels like driving simulator with tractors............  i can get that for 5.00 most any month on euro truck sim.  so no ty.

because of how the ai, and maps are built in 22 it broke most the good mods.  and really ruined the main aspect of the game that i enjoy most in fs 17.  which is running 10+ machines at once.  having 3 harvesters in 1 field, 2 tractors with carts keeping them empty, 2 trucks running non stop, and then 3 more tractors baling, and picking up bales. behind all that...  i enjoy doing all that.  sadly u just cant do that in anything past fs 17",1688947552,1690822202,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Its gameplay systems are deep enough to enable meaningful expression of a player's agronomic will without punishing you harshly for mistakes or bad luck. It encourages you to experiment and find your own best practices. If a scheme doesn't work out, you can always sell off and try something else. Some people grow grain. Some grow vegetables. Still others raise livestock. How exactly to spend your daylight is an ongoing journey.

I highly recommend the new seasonal growth option. Inspired by the Season mod from the previous game, it adds a time dimension that provides structure to gameplay. Repetitive chores becomes yearly rituals. Off seasons become time for experimentation and speculation. Crop scheduling becomes a puzzle with many solutions.

If you're looking for cutthroat business sim, you'll be disappointed. Farming Simulator 22 is a game for chilling out and letting your mind wander.",1648679431,1690679572,True,1,0,0.489795893430709839,0,True,False,False

But its still fun. If you own one of th predecessors....dont buy.





Old Review:
I dont complain about bugs like the massive DLSS Ghosting at night or the shitty Performance for this 2008 Graphics. The awful Sound. The bitchy and lame Physics. Thats FS, you know its not really a simulator, the Gamemechanics Vanilla are shitty as fugg. But the game is still fun, it eats time. I dont complain about massive deprovements like still no good Housing or the fact that you cant delete or use the Farms which are on the maps. The Devs develop their game at this point to 50%, the rest of the improvements are done by the modders. Without effort. Well played Giants. I dont speak about nice to have improvements. Basic things you NEED to play this game, are only done per mod. 

But ok its a B 10-30 Euro Game (noone pays full Price for this, sorry, a Valheim costs 15 and is more in shape), so i dont expect a AAA Game. 

But this game is mainly about Multiplayer. And it doesnt work. Not Blizzard D2 like with Queues, it simplay doesnt work. At Releaseday it was possible to play, but now......you cant get in any game with friends. Even with a own Server, its not possible, because giants masterserver cant handle it. I cant hear ""We underestimated the player counts"" anymore from any studio. I bought this on release and can play it 4-8 weeks later because Devs or Publisher say ""Dont buy to much server capacity only for the first 4 weeks. Wait until the playerbase is lower"". And then 2 Years later ""Yeah Game XY sold not well enough, we need more monetarisation"" 

The only improvements Devs made in 3 Years: A new map. They implemented the season mod (thanks to the modders). They cut out many vehicles for DLC Plan (wait for the modders, you get all Vehicles and Maps without spending money ;)). Thats it. Oh and crossplay, so the consolepeasants can play while the guys who made Giant big (lol), the PC Masterrace, cant play. Thanks for that.

I usually dont buy games at release, especially AAA Games (last was Red Dead 2). But i trusted Giants. But now they are only the greedy Fuggheads, like a Bobby KOTick or the Guy from EA, dont know his Name.......Hitler Devil Trump i think.

DONT BUY THIS GAME AT THE MOMENT. WAIT FEW MONTHS UNTIL DEVS PATCHED IT PLAYABLE, THEN PAY 10 BUCKS. ITS NOT WORTH MORE MONEY. BUY SOME CHEESEBURGERS INSTEAD. THEY DONT TASTE GOOD; BUT YOU GET WHAT YOU ORDERED.",1637773570,1690538743,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

With each release, my expectations for a more realistic and immersive farming experience grew, but sadly, I find myself somewhat disappointed with the recent developments.

Undoubtedly, the game has its merits, but it's hard not to notice the missed potential for true authenticity. One aspect that stood out to me was the ground and weight physics on the machines. With Giants Software's substantial budget, I had hoped for a leap forward in this area. Realistic weight distribution and terrain deformation would have added an unparalleled level of depth and realism to the gameplay, making the farming activities truly come alive.

One of the features that I was particularly excited about was the first-person view inside the tractor. I imagined being able to reach out and interact with buttons and levers just like a real farmer would, adding an extra layer of immersion. However, to my disappointment, this level of detail was absent, leaving the tractor experience feeling somewhat detached from reality.

Farming Simulator revolves around spending countless hours driving tractors, and I expected a more polished approach to animations in this context. A well-crafted animation while driving could have breathed life into the in-game character and made the whole experience more engaging and personal.

On the subject of downloadable content (DLC), I must admit that while I appreciate the effort put into creating new content, the recent offerings have been less than satisfying. Some of the DLCs feel lackluster and come with a rather hefty price tag, which leaves me questioning their value.

I don't mean to overlook the positives, but I can't help but feel that Giants Software could have put their ample resources to better use. Instead of investing in expensive yet unsatisfactory DLCs, I had hoped they would focus on enhancing the core gameplay with more realistic mechanics and features.

In conclusion, Farming Simulator has its strengths, and I admire the passion of the developers. However, the missed opportunities for true authenticity and immersion leave me longing for more. With a game that thrives on delivering a genuine farming experience, it's crucial for Giants Software to listen to the community's feedback and prioritize the elements that truly matter. As a dedicated fan, I look forward to future updates that address these concerns and elevate the farming simulation to new heights. Until then, it feels like a promising experience that hasn't quite blossomed to its full potential.",1689940382,1689940382,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Thus far i really like the game, it plays pretty much the same as fs19 so thats a good thing in my opinion.
I like what they have done with the UI and the reworked AI system. Same goes for the production chains you can now set up.

I have seen the occasional visial glitches and bugs. That can be a bit annoying, but they are rare to happen. The physics can absolutely F things up, but most of the times it will give you a big laugh by how your (insert thing) goes flying away.

Looks like Giants yet again didn't fix any of the forestry bugs from FS19.  Logs still pop right out through the logging tools.  Logs sometimes start to shift all on their own inside the trailer.  Logging tools get stuck on the trees they are cutting down.

I seriously think the only thing Giants did with FS22 was update the graphics and added seasons which is worse than the modded seasons from FS19.  Modders seriously know how to code 1000x better than a Giants dev.

Edit:  1.5 months later and game is still mostly bugged and I have learned that GIANT doesn't know how to do multicore coding which is why the game only utilizes 30% gpu loads and 50% of my gpu memory and only 15% of my cpu usage.  Surprisingly the game only uses about 2-3 GB of ram and yet it at times runs like a pig.  You can even set the graphics low and it doesn't help because there is probably some really bad coding.

The patch before Christmas did next to nothing for the game.  Yes many of them are just quality of life issues but some are annoying. But at least they fixed the contracts that required 100,000 liters from a 0.5ha field haha.  But they haven't fixed it so the AI farms do there own work and all there crops just sit there withered and full of weeds unless you go and do the work for them so it looks really stupid driving down the roads.  And those two examples are just the start of it.

After the patch I found 3 of my crops withered, key binds were all gone, and two of my structures disappeared and they were not even mod structures.

Then there is damage rates of vehicles.  You don't want to repair vehicles because it costs about 10x more than you make from selling crops at peak selling times.  So you have to keep your vehicles and equipment broken to operate.

The amount of stones they show on fields looks really stupid.  A field after plowing looks more like a quarry than a field with mix of some large rocks  here and there.  These guys really need to go do some volunteer work on farms to see what really happens.  Or at least watch some youtube videos of farmers who have plowed a grass field under.  There are rocks pulled up but no where near what it looks like in game.

If this is the quality of work people from GIANT do, I wouldn't want to hire them should they go looking for jobs when there done at GIANT.


Really disappointed with Giant software and the way they develop.  FS22 has very few original ideas added to it.  Most of the update is graphics (which I don't like) or adding stuff modders already added to the game.  So basically profiting off other peoples ideas (seasons, production chains).  Not that I don't want to see that being added, but it seems so little and not done as well other than graphics maybe.

For example:  FS19 modded Seasons gives more weather info, such as chance of precipitation and crop rotations.

As for graphics, things seem more blurry.  It is like the farmer always has bad eye sight.  Tried turning on MSAA but it has bad stutters, not sure they coded it correctly.  I've used MSAA in huge amounts of other games with barely any FPS loss.

They did not improve the AI, they made it worse.  Luckily the AI doesn't damage fields.  But I've watched the AI drive a harvester back into the field it needs to cut.  The AI vehicles still don't stop at stop signs so expect to get rammed if you don't yield to traffic at all intersections.

I was also hoping since they seem to be supporting north american map better that they'd add more american equipment.  But still 99% of the equipment has the EU hazard stripes rather than triangles.  Not sure why they even bothered to put in a US based map.  Thus they really lack in game immersion.

Only thing I really liked over a modded FS19 is that they added gear shifting and a bit of force feedback which in itself was a shoddy type of FFB.  Basically just added some centering spring force.  As for gear shifting, it would have been better if they had control settings grouped into vehicle types.  So CVT drive vehicles use certain gamepad/wheel bindings.  And things like the Manual + Powershift would have there own, so that no bindings overlap.  Same goes for trucks which they could have setup similar to how ATS/ETS2 have setup.

Overall, I personally feel a person is better off playing FS19 modded until people have remade there mods for FS22.  And from reading forums, it could take a couple of months to get enough mods that will make FS22 worth it.  So basically if you use a lot of mods, stick to FS19 for a bit longer.  My main point is, if your going to add what modders made to the vanilla version of the game, do it 100% or preferably 120-150% better because the modders are sometimes limited by the main game itself.",1637791325,1689406103,False,2,0,0.508086681365966797,0,True,False,False

Seriously, the fields are lush and vibrant, and the farm machinery looks so shiny you'd think it just rolled off a showroom floor. I half expected my tractor to start blasting tunes and ask if I wanted fries with that!

And speaking of machinery, Farming Simulator 2022 has more options than a buffet on cheat day. We've got tractors of all shapes and sizes, harvesters that are like giant metal Pac-Men gobbling up crops, and even tools that make gardening look like a dance party. Who knew farming could be this cool?

Now, let's talk game-play. Planting and harvesting crops have never been so addictive! It's like playing a high-stakes version of Whack-A-Mole, but instead of moles, you're smacking seeds into the ground and harvesting them like a champ. The controls are smooth as butter, and even if you have butter fingers, you'll still feel like a pro farmer.

What really cracked me up were the new crop varieties they've thrown into the mix. I mean, who needs just corn and wheat when you can grow wild stuff like purple potatoes or rainbow carrots? Farming Simulator 2022 is like a fashion show for fruits and veggies. I wouldn't be surprised if there's a hidden unicorn crop waiting to be discovered!

Now, I have to admit, this game isn't all sunshine and rainbows. The AI could use a little extra brainpower, especially when it comes to our lovely NPCs. They sometimes wander around like lost sheep or stare at you with a vacant expression that says, ""I have no idea what I'm doing."" But hey, we all have those days, right?

Overall, Farming Simulator 2022 is a hilarious, comedic farming extravaganza that's perfect for anyone who wants a break from reality and dive headfirst into a virtual farm. It's the kind of game that'll have you laughing at the absurdity of it all while secretly getting emotionally attached to your pixelated crops.

So grab a straw hat, put on your best farming playlist, and get ready to plow, plant, and laugh your way through Farming Simulator 2022. It's a farming adventure that's as fun as watching pigs dance and cows do the Mac-arena. Yeehaw!

No summer sale, no discounts.
Only buy it if you see a very good deal on it, otherwise they just rob you.

Been playing FS since 2017.  Nice incremental improvements in 2019 and then in 2022, but I'm underwhelmed, especially considering that FS2022 has been full price (and more than previous releases) for almost a year before the first sale.  When I say ""full price"", I mean close to AAA games.  FS is NOT a AAA title, and worse, there's still plenty of add-on content to purchase to get everything, such as ""Platinum Edition"" which doesn't include Year 1 Season, Year 2 Season, etc... ok, anyways, let's get behind pricing and value (bang for your buck).

CaseIH has been mostly nerfed in FS2022.  It's probably not the only brand but the most noticeable for me coming from FS'19.  I get that John Deere is the new hot commodity -- and I suspect that the licensing deal is part of the explanation for increased pricing -- but come on, did we really have to make it THIS obvious?  Several CaseIH models are missing and some that are in the game are almost a joke.  It's almost like each release of Farm Sim is now going to be themed around a specific brand.  Is that really the way to go?  Lol, no, because it's just not right.

Ok, so some are thinking I'm a brand loyalist at this point.  Let me REALLY get into the nitty-gritty now.
 
!!! PROS !!!
*Runs well on Ryzen 7000-series (almost no CPU utilization) and Radeon RX 7900 XT (about 50% utilization at 1440p @ 60 Hz, max settings).  DX12 introduction new for FS22 is NICE -- almost introduces a problem where it's TOO GPU bound and not enough CPU bound, lol.  Not complaining here though -- TY devs.  Not sure where Vulkan stands though...
*Crop seasons, raw variety of different equipment to purchase, and great native mod support are definitely wins.
* Multiplayer is nice... even if it has a lot of room for improvement (I elaborate on this later)
* Physics seems to have improved, though it's still not like that found in SnowRunner and some other sims/excellent off-road physics games
**ADDED 25JUN2023:  I'm generally enjoying the game enough to continue logging hours on it, so it's not all doom and gloom, lol.  I did have to recover an auto-saved game after my son sold a bunch of my equipment for some other ""fun stuff"" that wasn't really practical... anyways, my point is that I appreciate that relatively robust save-game system.  The wife has been playing Sims 4 for like 10 years and still no auto-save, LMAO.

!!! CONS !!!
* CaseIH and other brands being nerfed or less models available in favor of John Deere
* Only four maps?  Really!?
* Rolling can't be turned off.  Not a common thing in the U.S. Midwest so kind of odd...
* Limited number of online radio stations; why can't this be more easily customized??
* Bushes are hard to get rid of -- painting ground textures (grass, gravel, etc.) is the only guaranteed bet but costs money
* Landscaping is EXPENSIVE, **EDIT 25JUN2023** IDEA: Should be able to simulate changes and then choose to commit or discard
* The economy on medium difficulty is a bit expensive for equipment repairs (degrades condition too fast) and crops pay a bit low even with near 100% yield bonus which takes a lot of time to achieve such yields  **EDIT 25JUN2023** I also realize that passive income like animals, solar, etc. is a smart way to boost earnings, but either grain sales pays a little too low or maintenance costs/deteriation speed is too aggressive
* Contracted jobs pay low, especially when using one's own equipment (after factoring fuel and repairs) and for certain jobs types
* Contracted jobs seem to get stuck... e.g. baling and others that *EDIT* take a long time to  move on unless you complete them or at least start them and purposely fail them
* Having AI operate one's equipment is too expensive unless the very largest tractors, harvesters, implements, etc. is used, and even then profit margin is still questionable
* Variety of side-by-sides and farm trucks is laughable... modded trucks provide a way better value and more worthwhile, even for users trying to be ""ultra-realistic"".  
* Multiplayer should have an option for ""realistic"" vs. ""arcade"" whereas realistic means players don't ignore equipment boxes (falling inside and thru tractors, etc.) while arcade is the current style ""players of equipment they aren't driving around bound to there dimensions and therefore ""fall right through""
* Multiplayer should have a manual or automatic refresh option; my friend will create a game, but if I join too early, it doesn't show and won't ever show until I back all the way back out and go into 'Multiplayer' -> 'Join Game' again
* Similar to equipment condition, paint condition degrades WAAAYYYY too quickly, even for equipment that is stored under a shed or whatever with a roof and is properly maintained
*  There should be some kind of system for discounts, specials, etc. on seed, fertilizer, and other typically-palletized/bagged products.
* Still no tractor cab doors and windows that can't be opened unless its modded?  SAD times.
* Almost all manual and powershift transmissions are gone in tractors... B.S.!  This relates back to the fact that some brands don't have models from 10, 20, 30 years ago.  How about we have a ""used market"" for older equipment models; not every farmer wishes to purchase a brand-new, 0 hours tractor.
* Maps need to get bigger; semi trucks and other fast vehicles can get from one side to another in no time.  Maybe variable map sizes need to at least become an option the future, with higher-end systems able to play on those larger map sizes (talking stock, not just modded)
* No ability to control left/right brake pedals, diff locks, and 2WD vs. 4WD on capable tractors
* Tractors with CVT trannies still seem to rev high even when engine load is very low *EDIT 25JUN2023:  Not enough PowerShift or other manual/semi-manual trannies.  I think this also reflects that there should be more older-model tractors in the game as many farmers turn to the used market; buying 15-30 year old tractors in the U.S. is a very common practice
* Houses, sheds, etc. don't overcome chopped down trees, resulting in some weird foundations and auto-landscaping effects.  Their placement should either require complete elimation of trees and stumps or just raise the price of installation and automatically include the removal (my preference but maybe this could be a setting?)
* Loans should have more detail to them, e.g. lines of credit (similar to how it's down now on a monthly basis in small $5K increments) with more formal loans in larger allotments offering more specific pay-off and interest terms
* Ability to buy other farm houses, sheds, etc. on property that is purchased
* The high pressure washer isn't mobile and costs $5K?  Really?
EDIT (ADD):  * NPC traffic likes to turn right in front of you, causing a crash, even when one's own speed is constant, i.e. they should be able to calculate and predict if they should wait to turn or go ahead and make the turn.  They are aggressive drivers as it currently stands.
EDIT (ADD):  * When you purchase a dog, he/she runs in slow motion.  It literally had me and my son laughing out loud.  Otherwise, it's a nice touch and fun to play ball with him/her.
** EDIT (ADD) on 25JUN2023:  would really like to frame rate limiting natively built-in.

This may start to sound like a rant but when you charge near-AAA pricing for a game, one expects near-AAA features and such.  Furthermore, detailed feedback is how I believe the most important, juicy changes will come about, not high-level crabbing and moaning.

The only downsides I see is GIANTS which offer a YEAR SEASON PASS these I feel are pointless (even though I have never brought one) just seems a waste of money until the game releases all the content for that year and you then see if it is worth it or not. However the MODHUB is the main feature I use and have ran every single mod to date and no issues.
I do wish GIANTS would approve things quicker for maps and UK realistic maps than hold back as prefer these sort of game modes. 
I also run the Facebook Group which has been going since FS19 came out.

I only own Farm Sim 17, not 19. But I have done my research on 19. I am basing this review on the difference from 17 to 22.

The Good:
- More stuff to do. More crops, more vehicles, more contracts and more animals to own (Bees, Horses, Sheep). 
- Better graphics, sounds (everything now has a sound to it) and maps. The graphics can look crude in some places though.
- Some level of wildlife is actually in the game now. You will see deer and crows.
- You can now own dogs but they can't herd for you. It would be cool if they added this though.
- Seasons and companies now incorporated into base game. You can own companies now. 
- You now have to buy land, not just fields.
- New hard mode. You can now start from nothing.

The bad:
- Physics could still use some work. 
- Vehicles still feel arcadey. 
- Collision detection and gravity is still awkward. You will get stuck walking on foot and you can glue yourself to walls.
- Giant needs to listen to the fans more. Any popular mod that everyone uses needs to be implemented into the game.
- Too much DLC. They are spacing the next release further and further away (its now 2023 and still no new mainline release) so I understand they need to make money. But we are now approaching the sims level of DLC. This does discourage some people from buying the game. 

DLC is 100% not needed though! Base game is enough. You can download mods to tailor the game to your liking.

Overall, I'm happy but I do understand if you own 19 you may be hesitant to buy 22. It's £25 for the base game and I'll probably play this for at least a hundred hours so its worth the money to me. 

If you're new to the franchise, don't buy this expecting AAA level of quality. Its a AA game. If you don't own any Farm Sim game, then buy this one. This is the best version. 
If you want a relaxing game to listen to music and podcasts, this is perfect for that.",1687107648,1687107648,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It starts with the fact that you still can't connect with friends via Steam and have to hope that a friend's server will be suggested to you. Sometimes you have to restart the game 5-6 times for that to happen, but sometimes you see the server as soon as it starts. Once you've found the server, you have to spend 20-30 seconds syncing the game data, pausing the game for everyone, then repeating the previous process, because sometimes terraformed objects or textures are set to default locally, which is then fixed by reconnecting. Then when you are finally in the game, desync or rubberbanding occurs. I don't know of any other game where this is so extreme. 
The multiplayer is the only thing besides mods that keeps the game alive, so it's even sadder that it's so poorly implemented. I really hope these issues are fixed in the next installment and am disappointed that even Farming Simulator 2011 runs more stable.",1687098052,1687098052,False,12,0,0.58131331205368042,0,True,False,False

Game has had zero true support by Giants and its dev team. The game is still as buggy if not more buggy in some instances. Giants really dropped teh ball with this game and sadly , Giants this will be my last ever support of this game, one I have known since FS15. You found a way to kill it, for not just me but many who are internationally saying you fucked up, but you still believe you are great. Giants have fallen.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
February 2023 
Actively streaming the game still wanting to enjoy it but still seeing how Giants F****** its fan base buy adding season pass 2 but still no importance to it or coordination with DLC. Giants has become what it set out to be a farm sim game that robs its fan base at every turn. Also DLC for pumps and Hoses you mean manure system only, not anything else useful. How dumb are you portraying the european, British, and American farmers (Including Canada in America). Do you really think that is how badly they operate farms. I remember the PHD who came onto farmcon and said Giants and FS22 are paving the way to show how farming is truly. Wow that was an overshot by far. Yes finances are scarily accurate and profit margins are about right but tell me do you think the farmers of the world are as shit at farming as you are at making a sim on their careers?

JUNE 2022
    So the game is still badly glitched at this point I started up a new farm standard start out, wentgood but after hour two attachments wouldn't detach or attach. Mods/No Mods it doesn't matter. GIANTS what have you done since 2019?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I love the series since I Started it back when it was at Farming Sim 13, however I Will say they still didn't meet their hype, due to issues that still remain that at FarmCon they made it sound as if they were gone. Many things to say but too much that would sound negative when I am just criticizing for growth.",1639702887,1686249668,False,0,0,0.513777256011962891,0,True,False,False
