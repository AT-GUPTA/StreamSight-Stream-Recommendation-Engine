There are a few issues, but what survival game doesn't.

You have the ability to change the hardcore difficulty options on the fly like permadeath, loot respawn that makes this game more challenging unlike some of those other games. This game has it all when it comes to a true feeling of a survival game and the development is on the right track. I've put in thousands of hours in those other games, and thought long and hard about saying this but this survival game is pace to become my favorite goto survival game.

I think firearms is great to have in the game, especially if u wanna do some player PVP with other people at some point. (I come from Rust, 7Days2Die, sons Of The Forest etc) So this is by far one of the better Survival games imo. I only recently fell over this game (Like last week lol) And i cant stop playing it, so keep up the great work! Ive only seen very few bugs in the game so far, but nothing game breaking at all. So far ive only played solo, so not sure how the MP looks like with bugs atm if any. I think maybe Bicycle's for early game would be fun too of possible.. Like finding them around the map so u have an easier transportation with a little storage for loot. Recipe's or some info for food making etc would be nice as well, since atm u might lose ur hard found food going to waste cuz it cant be made so it just vanish instead.

** I recommend starting on easy i think it was so you start with a backpack as they can be very difficult to find, thus killing the will to even try the game.** I think the normal/hard mode will definitely appeal to those who really like a challenge. 

Good:

-lots to learn in tech tree and abilities take some time and effort to earn
-looks OK, its pre release so what do you expect. some lag when travelling quickly between areas when the zombies spawn
-can be made challenging for any level of experience with the detailed-ish in game settings 
-lots of buildables and placeables
-base building is pretty limitless, however without correct structural supports, buildings will collapse
-lots to explore, locations have a lot to interact with
-you can have a base with NPC's so it doesn't feel as lonely
-the NPC'c actually contribute to production and protection
-inventory layout is ok, again pre release so im sure some improvements will be made there 
-gun handling feels ok for pre release 
-loot is well balanced and makes sense. For example, at a farm, youll actually find what you'd expect to loot at a farm 
-Zombie aggro seems balanced enough, and the supers are hard to kill (also a negative as you can just stand on a fence to kill them as the AI isn't quite there yet)
-lots of changeable settings to create a game that suits your level of skill/understanding
-standard Z's can climb so you do have to take care when looting an area until youre fully kitted. even then you can be caught out
-you can raise and breed livestock, making the game feel less lonely 
-weather seasons are cool
-a cheap 100hrs worth of game time easily. 

Bad: 
(assuming these are all things that will be fixed or tweaked in the future)
-Odd crashes here and there but this SHOULD be expected 
-still feels a little clunky
-special zombies can be bamboozled easily by standing on a fence or something tall they cannot climb
-items and vehicles seem to deteriorate a little fast for my preferences 
-climbing is a little buggy
-some aspects of inventory are clunky, like changing backpack for example
-some items take up a lot more space than i think they should
-if you're driving in a car to a town or area where z's spawn there is a tiny hardware delay and you see them spawn in 
-traders are kind of expensive 
-fuel lasts a while in generators but not in vehicles
-tech tree layout doesn't feel right. some items i feel should be easier to obtain than they are
-occasional sound glitches 
-trees cut down sometimes have a mind of their own and will kill you 
-looting takes too long IMO
-summer season requires you to be in your underwear otherwise constant overheating warnings. this increases the chances of getting an infection/bleeding
-only 5 NPC's currently available
-NPC management is a little glitchy. you can only give them a weapon AFTER you have built them a home
-NPC management limited. if you have all 5 you can only assign all 5 to one task or ""balanced""


I hope this is useful for anyone who is looking to buy the game. It really isn't that bad for an early access. There is WAYYYY more titles at this stage that are abysmal.

need water around every corner and zombies are one after another unless you set the server.
I can think of a lot of other games that I have enjoyed more. learn, build and level up skills seem to be hidden until you discover how to level up and learn after that its oK.
Low to midland for me anyway,
No way points, no maker after zombies kill your char also the pointer on the map for your direction of travel is difficult to see what way your traveling. Cars take damage fast and are difficult to drive 
Not the worst game and is early access
after all the basics for learning how to level up with the assistance of other players and youtube. ""needs a tutorial"" and the recent upgrades its not turning out too bad.
Still needs a death marker less you check your map for GPS location ""large map""
also spawn back at your sleeping bag with nothing, sometimes in the winter leaving no option but to gather clothes or do it again and again. still not real bad just be careful. 50 hour of game time",1705817774,1706691002,True,0,0,0.523026347160339355,0,True,False,True

You can customize your guns (providing you scavenge up just the right type of gun mods). Currently it doesn't look like ALL the weapons mods show up on gun models but scopes and muzzle attachments do. And this is anecdotale at best but it seems that suppressors/silencers doesn't work properly yet.

- A compass and GPS for a mini-map
- More descriptions on how to get your stats up with the emote system (For new players)
- When you turn lights on when it's raining you can't see, but when you turn off the light you can see, which is a little weird
- Rework how vehicle damage is done since some things that you hit hard won't take a lot of vehicle health, but a simple rock/tree/1 zombie hit can take half of your vehicles health at times
- Add an auto sorter to the inventory
- Rework melee weapons health since they break to fast with no way to fix them unlike guns

Character animations are very very good ,from combat to mining ore , running ,walking etc .. 
Zombie animations are again fantastic , different zombie characters and hit areas for exploding arms , exploding heads etc.
environment / map . very large and varies in terrain .
weapons,ammo,food,water are plentiful 
IMO i am positive that this game will fit almost any type of gamer , there are many different ways to play this game .
the skill tree and items that are available offer a tremendous amount of content  from sewing machines to advanced chemical tables . unique decorative items as well for late / end game . 

CONS : snapping building tiles could be improved upon
Drive-able cars could be improved upon . they are fragile as well as the steering sensitivity . 
Bandit camps could be improved upon as well . bandits should scatter when chasing you not run in a single  line for an easy spray kill of 5 or more .
I would highly recommend this game if you like to craft /with many different tools/ , hunt , and combat with bandits , bosses , zombies and explore .

However, with around 44 hours now invested (at time of writing), I can say I enjoy this game more-and-more. The progression can be a difficult grind, but once I learned how to balance my own gameplay, I found the complexities of the game to be quite intelligently thought out. Now, this is my favorite go-to game. Sometimes I am in the mood to build and expand my base. Other times, I am out searching for a new blueprint. The game doesn't ever really get ""easy"". For example, if you corner yourself during an attack, you are bound to die. That said, it is also a constant and looming reality when you venture into houses to find loot. So, you have to think things through and choose the right weapon if it does happen (an automatic weapon helps to unleash a quick fury of rounds to avoid being ambushed). I have yet to do everything in this game. I am having a lot of fun and look forward to improvements. Here are my thoughts on those:

- vehicles need to be more quickly accessible. Once found, it is nearly impossible to maintain the health of the vehicle (assuming you already have  repair kit to get it running) and worry about gas (on top of all of the many relentless survival mechanisms consuming your attention). I have yet to find a repair kit anywhere on the map, and even after 44 hours, I still have not been able to unlock enough technology to build them myself. 

- food needs to spoil more slowly. You pick up a canned good and it spoils after only 2-3 days. A similar decay applies to firearms, tools, and weapons. Without adjusting to a high loot abundance in the gameplay settings (and thus finding picks, axes, etc. in loot containers), I find myself grinding to create tools... which take seemingly forever. 

All-in-all, it is a unique survival experience that keeps you on your toes.

I've got a little over 115 hours in and I've done most of what there is to do in the game at the time of writing. The only thing I've yet to do is get animals to put in my breeding pen, but since I have the NPC buildings, they bring me plenty of materials and I don't know that I even need animals at this point.

The survival elements are pretty good, but if you loot the right locations food and water are really not an issue. There is still balancing that needs to take place in several places, notably the trade prices, food recipes and how damage works in regards to vehicles. 

The melee fighting is a bit lacking as others have said, but if you play a little you'll get the timing down it's pretty easy to handle. You can become overwhelmed pretty easily if there are 5 or more zombies with only melee though, especially if there are runners or any of the 3 special zombies currently in game. 

The driving experience obviously varies across the 3 different vehicles currently in-game, but is universally dangerous to some degree when done off-road. The good news is at this time you cannot blow up your vehicle, it only stops working when you break it...but it's pretty easy to damage the thing if you're not careful.

I like the apparently new NPC system, but I think it's almost too generous honestly. I only recently got mine set up when I actually realized it was a thing and it's given me so much ore I hardly need to mine at this point. 

This review may come off as somewhat critical of the game, but as I have over 100 hours and counting in the game and I am only 2 achievement shy of a perfect game I clearly am having a good time. Survival games have been my go-to for nearly the last decade, and assuming the dev team continues working on this title, it has amazing promise in my opinion.

I plan to update this review as things develop. In fact, I think I might start a new game and try to base in a new area for a different experience. If you're on the fence, you can wait for a sale; but I'd say go ahead and pull the trigger because it IS a good (early access) survival game.",1705637460,1705637460,True,29,0,0.705919146537780762,0,True,False,True

Some items that could use some work

What i think and see are my opinions. should play for yourself to make a judgment.

- Zombies are deformed before and after killing them. mainly the slender ones.
-Vehicles could use some tweaking on damage.. hit a zombie and take half damage.. Jump off a cliff take no damage..
-Map size.  For single player the maps are good size. but if your looking for a good map for 5+ players they seem a little small..
-Gun trophies.. make them more harder to get..  i say that because once you get the SKS you can almost 1 shot any zombie on the map unless its the big fat guy or the claw zombie.

This is a great start for a new game. And looking forward to what comes out in the future..

Why? 

1. The dev is addicted to adding non-stop Unreal assets.
2. The game is SUPER unpolished, all of the stuff that's added in reason 1, is never cleaned up.

Middle of the Road:
1. Graphics, they are good on certain things, then garbage on other things.

What is good about the game?

1. The mechanics aren't terrible.
2. The Idea.
3. The dev does do frequent updates, but none that are meaningful or do any real polishing, As stated above. But there is somewhat of some care there, as they are continuously updating, even if it's not the fixing the right things.
4. The game is cheap

Advice to dev

Stop adding stuff, and start just polishing what you have. The AI are ridiculous, way overpowered and broken. This game needs help in the immersion department. It gets old after the first 5 hours. 
Right now, there isn't anything better in this game then State of Decay 2, or 7 Days to Die. 7DTD has the same issue, nothing really immersive that draws you in. You don't need a story, but actual goals, helping survivors, killing the bad, and eventually trying to rebuild a society. None of these Zombie games have done this, and it's the REAL Zombie game the people want. PS the Traders being in the game aren't realistic the way they are. Give players classes at the beginning, you know mechanics, electricians, medic, soldier, ect... This way they can make this like repair kits, med supplies, bullets, and traps. I understand it is in early access. But I just don't see any real vision for the game.

you just cant manipulate terrain and they use a different building method, which i actually prefer

-traders are actually useful, especially after their recent update
-looting is a bit reminiscent of state of decay, youll need to use stealth
-the big grind for materials doesnt really start untill youre likely at a pretty well set up state. i didnt need to start making trips to actual mines until after 20 hours of play and by that point i had a truck, the base had power and running water as well as most of the top level crafting tables 
-balancing your survival bars is surprisingly not that difficult so long as you keep an eye on them and plan ahead
-there's a pretty good variety in guns in the game and lots of parts for them. which makes for a great time attacking bandit camps  

ive mostly played in my own single player world, but online multiplayer is also currently available in servers of up to 10 players
if you want, you can actually turn up the loot abundance, drop in with some friends and without even using the crafting systems. just loot homes for firearms and ammo and play pvp games 
with the recent update to traders and the challenges/rewards they offer, you can can amass an arsenal within a couple hours

its still an early access game and with that comes some issues but nothing really that bad, to be honest. at least nothing that i have encountered
-vehichles need to be handled very gently because hitting a speedbump too quick can take out almost 40% of its durability. which just means, go slow offroad, stick to dirt paths and roads 
-vehicles are always on the losing end of any kind of impact. do not try to run over a wolf or even a single zombie, its not worth it (bonus points for making car repair kits incredibly easy to make or buy at a shop)
-due to the EA state of the game, most buildings dont let you go higher than 2 floors unless you build to them, sometimes youll find completely empty rooms, but at least there's loot sprinkled around on the floor

-there's more negatives about the current state of the game but honestly there such insignificant QOL issues that i cant even remember anymore right now 
 
if this is the game as a work in progress, this is a great start. i would actually put it as it is right now at or above 7days
if youre into open world survival crafting games, id strongly recommend this one, especially because i got it during the winter sale for 10 bucks.",1704584305,1704584305,True,5,0,0.572975039482116699,0,True,False,True

There is the ability for PVP if you are into it and can actually make things pretty interesting. There are flaws and sadly I will list them below.

-Online game stability has a tendency to lag players or even cause a critical failure and close the game. If this happens you will need to close out the game and reopen it to re-log into a world. 
-There are some issues with certain construction resources. I may not understand it but I cannot seem to make a second floor to any buildings I construct. If I am just inept I will submit to that.
-Zombies can sometimes come through walls or other barriers and attack you causing some random deaths
-If you are playing in another person's game you have a possibility or not actually reloading a weapon when you try. An example is literally watching my character reload a shotgun of 12 rounds for a minute before it actually finished.
-There may be more issues that arise as I play more but I have hope that the game developers will take care of these issues in later patches and this game can be amazing.",1704416827,1704416827,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

This game was on sale for $8 when I picked it up. The thirty day review average was noticeably very poor (52%), but I love zombie survival, so what can I do? Eight dollars was hard to pass up. I will admit: I hate-bought this game based on recent reviews and the $8 price point; I really wanted to dog on it, but it sucked me in. So here is a positive interim review. 

✅playable, fun, get your money's worth
✅zombies, ✅loot
✅survival, exploration
✅crafting, building
✅tech tree, skill progression
✅detailed configuration of difficulty
✅canned beans, chili, etc

❌somewhat difficult to learn
❌even a bit grindy on easy
❌the animals are rudimentary, the wolves make a howl animation but no sound, etc

A lot of the complaints I read about I did not find to be actually true during my initial two hour play testing. Note that Steam requires under two hours of play time (or two weeks of game ownership) to qualify for a refund. I see no reason to refund this game. The chief complaint in recent reviews is the melee tuning; I had no trouble at all with melee while in first person (press V), and I am a mediocre gamer. I have been playing Single Player on Easy, so I cannot speak to the higher difficulties nor to PVP nor Coop modes. 

In conclusion, eight dollars seems very reasonable for this game at its current state of about a year of Early Access. Note that a typical major title usually runs seven years of development. I recommend checking out ""No One Survived"" if you want a different take on zombie survival. Cheers. 🍺

This game is truly one of the worst products ive tried in the past 3 years, and I bought it for $8 I can't imagine what people thought when they spent $17 omg.

- 1st Person vs 3rd person fighting is terrible. Hitting zombies with melee in 1st has no impact sound, or reaction other than the zombie flinching. 3rd person gives SOME detail that youre actually hitting, but you are 60% less accurate with melee while in 3rd person
- Stamina. Stamina is garbage, genuinely awful. The time that it takes to drain is extremely fast and then 30x slower to regain. You physically cannot run away from a zombie, they continue to chase you, and if you lose your stamina you WILL get hit trying to regain it back.
- Guns are awful. Period. Every weapons recoil is genuinely the worst ive seen in any game, survival or not. Not to mention the HORRIBLE ADS in 1st person, AND the inaccurate pieces of shit they are. They do not shoot straight. Ever. Aim at head? hits the arm.
- Loot sucks. I lowered the abundance of loot, and found 2 containers with 5 weapons each. Doesn't make sense, who tf has that many? Why give us that much stuff?
- A lot of areas outside of the major cities are just factories. I ran to 6 different locations from where i spawned, 5 of which were factories, one was a farm. What the hell.

TLDR: The game isn't fun, it's not good, and doesn't have a ""good base"" like people claim. It has nothing special and nothing going for it other than it exists.

There's a lot of pop in for medium sized bushes and trees rather close to you and far away hills look barren when they aren't. UE5's nanite has been updated to fix all this when using foilage. So hopefully they can get the textures of the trees and pop-in changed. 

The quality of the graphics feel like a $10 game and the design of the mechanics feel like a $30 game. So it is worth the value you are paying.

The game overall just has that ""bought Unreal Assets"" stink to it, especially the UI and Inventory are extremely generic.

The many attributes of your character that you have to keep an eye on adds a lot of more things to do, because you have to obtain certain supplies to keep those up. Such as antibodies, hygiene, thirst, hunger, carbohydrates, protein... That's all I can think of. There is also traders around the map that can sell you armor, clothes, and other miscellaneous stuff. Starting out with nothing is difficult, but you can select to have a ""starter pack"" that basically gives you some food, water, and some medical supplies, as well as some weapons. There is 2 maps, one bigger than the other, but both are still some considerably big maps. The movement feels good, the weapons feel good, and the animations aren't bad either.

The game's optimization is overly poor where half the time I'm trying to spend playing the game I'm crashing and trying to reboot back into a server. This is probably the biggest issue I have with this game as you cannot play without something randomly causing you to crash.

Other cons:
-Skills degrade over time even after you've achieved a specific level in them causing you to spend more time in a book or over a furnace than you want to gain that sweet xp.

-Toolbelt limits users from putting items of different types into the slots (2 hand versus 1 handed) also the priority after you die for your retrieved items to your toolbelt and inventory are suspect. It causes you to die repeatedly more than not.

-Swimming gains you energy and the sound drops right off.

-Trees fall in random directions and sometimes just drop right through the bottom of the map.

-Zombies instantly regenerate in areas you've cleared and are hyper sensitive to your position even if you are 3 blocks away.

-Stacking of items like steel arrows has some bugs where it only allows 1 arrow to stack.

-You can ragdoll and die for no reason at some points.

There are ideas here that are good but none of them are doing it better than any other game in the style. 
I pretty much disliked everything about what this game offers. It has terrible sound, it looks like an UE5 asset flip, the menus are atrocious.
The best thing about this game is a the skill system and even then it could be refined and made nice.
There is also no multiplayer servers. It's pretty much dead on arrival.

Pros:
Skill system is nice.
Map is large but not too large. 
Large variety of weapons and crafting.
Pve for those who want it.

Con: 
Everything in the game feels jank.
First person feels horrible.
Sound is awful.
Menus are awful.
The games performance was dreadful.
The gunplay and melee is a 0/10.
No pvp or dedicated servers.

It is still in very early development and in my opinion should not be released for early access. It looks like a pre-alpha that is not intended for the public. I liked the game, but my friends didn't. I have by far the best PC of all. Handling the weapon feels very disgusting. The menu navigation is also bad, the zombies are also garbage, so the entire game is in a really unfinished state. The game appears to be unplayable. At least not at the current stage of development.

If you reset the graphics settings to default, the entire game will switch to Chinese.

There's also no hit feedback or anything else to make the game somewhat playable. I really can't recommend it to anyone. Not at the current stage of development.

In diesem Zustand kann ich das Spiel leider gar nicht empfehlen. 
es befindet sich noch in einer sehr frühen Entwicklungsphase und sollte meiner Meinung nach noch lange nicht in den early access geschickt werden. Es wirkt wie eine pre-alpha, welche nicht für die Öffentlichkeit bestimmt ist. Bei mir ruckelt das Spiel auch, bei meinen Freunden allerdings nicht. Dabei hab ich von allen mit Abstand den besten PC^^ Das Waffen-verhalten fühlt sich sehr ekelig an. Die Menüführung ebenso, die Zombies sind auch müll, also das gesamte Spiel ist in einem richtig unfertigen Zustand. Das Spiel fühlt sich nicht so an, als würde man es spielen können sollen. zumindest zum aktuellen Entwicklungsstand. 

Wenn man die Grafikeinstellungen auf Standard zurück stellt, stellt sich das komplette Spiel auf chinesisch um xD 
Es gibt auch kein Trefferfeedback oder sonst irgendetwas, damit sich das Spiel einigermaßen Spielbar anfühlt.  Ich kann es wirklich niemanden empfehlen. Nicht zum aktuellen Entwicklungszeitpunkt.

Feels like DayZ on steroids, but the zombies are kinda buggy, and felt lost aswell, didnt really have that kind of survival feeling, since everything is given to you at the start, which is an option, but felt like without them, you coudnt survive. but its definitely looks sick, and isnt stuttery at all.

As a player with almost 10k hours in DayZ from OGArma to 2.5k hours in expansion, the building is great, but more variety of building pieces would be fun. the survival mechanics are okay, and challenging, but could interact with the weather more to be more challenging. There's no real game breaking bugs, the graphics are phenomenal (unreal 5), physics are 7/10 but very functional. combat is on point. The trader system, reputation system, skill progression system, farming system, cooking system, hunting system, and manufacturing systems are great. improvements could be made to finding natural food sources (carbs) I have yet to Drive a car, or try out the command center/worker recruiting systems, but i definitely will.

I haven't attempted co-op yet, but it looks decent on the youtubes. I like the skill books and skill gain system as it gives a reason to explore the map.

However, this game has a super-limited stacking system and no auto-sort of any kind. The game feels like a school lab project. Manually tweaking stuff to fit in the backpack is tedious in the extreme. 

Another large limitation is that most POI's are static; they have very little or even zero things to interact with that are not loot containers. You can't climb most ladders, no elevators, no buttons that open or close off entryways, etc. The game is super basic especially concerning the engine used.

Somewhat mild thumbs down that may well change as the game gets updated. Edit, new patch came out but stack sizes were not addressed. Um, we got new paint for some of the guns and a whole one new POI.",1702236005,1703100775,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

-- terrain did not loaded in, so my car with 8 military backpacks worth of loot fallen tough it never to be seen again. 
-- progression is okay, however some things progress very easy and well - like Cooking, you`ll level it up whether you want it or not. Other things aren't progressing seemingly, it's quite difficult to start with Tailoring without a book, similar to Agriculture.
Switching from a first tier crafting bench to an electric one. Old blueprints in the new bench do not seem to have any benefits, just consume power, while they aren`t in the regular one?
-- food produce spoils way, way to fast. A freshly picked mushroom spoils in 3 hours. And it`s enough 1.5 hours if your character has a weak stomach trait to get food poisoning. 
-- mechanics of moving water from one bottle to another is extremely bad. Just needs some work so we`re not dragging a flask 3 times over the cattle. 
-- Damage of zombies to a car is ENORMOUS. Just bad. They also target the car when you are not around... why? 
My car lost 1\3 of durability rolling from a top of a mountain, yet it lost all it`s durability when fleshy zombie pissed on it`s tires twice? When car repair kits such a rarity, its too hash of a punishment
-- building is great. Love it. You actually need to work for it, as materials have to be collected, assembled.
Stairs tho! Stairs is a huge problem. Give us a vertical ladder of full block length and 1\3 and same for the stairs. 
Staircases now take too much space and effort to built if you need to go more than once. 
Towers basically ain`t an option without ladders too. 
-- chimney`s needs to be a thing. Smoke inhalation too :) push players to build in a way they can remove smoke from the building.
-- path to upgrade built objects, maybe? It`s a huge pain to switch from wood beam to a concrete, you are easy off just building from scratch, but that implying moving all your stuff, which is usually not fun. Maybe, some building menu item that we could attach to a wall, so it would temporary support it? Like scaffolding, with reclaimable resources? 
-- more weapon attachment. MOAR!11
-- weapon stats, so attachment`s benefits can be measured?
-- alarms  is good, but ive had lots of time when the same alarm re-triggered again and again. This is a dead sentence on an early game. Maybe some mechanics to allow you to ""lockpick"" it off?
-- spear is a very basics of a weapon. A stone spear can do magic. Yet we have a wooden spear on Weapon Craft 0 and then we have an Iron Spear on Weapon Craft 3. 
-- cars should have storage available corresponding to their types. Pickup truck has much more comparing to a smart-car. 
-- functional car should be able to help with being too cold or too warm for the price of spending fuel
-- Mines - great. Maybe, some technological machine to do the mining of the resources? Like with Oil wells? Small quantity would be fine, while passive and requiring protection from the zombies. 
-- end-game-ish NPCs... are practically useless? You spend a lot of resources to get them running at all and running more or less efficiently, have to spent lots of ammo to rescue them from bandits, then you assign them to collect wood and they overflow the inventory of a building with sticks instead of logs that you have to move manually out? At least let them use storages for logs, sticks, stones built in some area around. And\or allow to assign storage for other things like ores. 

largest issue i see with COOP in this game ... is that every character has to level up all the things separately anyway.  You can`t do Electric for one and Mechanics for another, to use both. Maybe it would be great addition if we could use those skills of separate characters somehow? Like in a party or a clan of some sort?

2. you can adjust the game difficulty at any time in game
3 you can toggle whether you want 3rd person or 1st person.
4. many weapons to choose from
5. I like the RPG element of this game. You can level up your character!
6. You can have your own farm!

Cons:
1. the game is very laggy sometimes (I have a good pc and should be able to run at max setting but the server is so laggy OR the game has a really bad optimization)
2. I like melee weapon but the hit box of melee weapon is off & clunky. Sometimes hitting 10 times with a hammer, only 2 hits actually land on the zombies.
3. you can't block in combat and the melee attack animation is clunky and weird.
4. the building menu is limited and it is hard to place the foundation at the right angle that you want. I hope the dev can improve the building mode UI. When I delete 1 foundation, the game often also deletes the other foundations nearby.It is frustrating.
5. harsh death penalty: now if you die, your skills will decrease and you have to relevel again and leveling your skill is not easy.
6. The trees are buggy and bouncy, when you chop down the trees, it can suddenly bounce to you even if you stand far away and kill you on spot.
7. Many things are unexplained and confusing in the game and severely lacking tooltips information. Even if you search on internet, there is very limited info about the game.",1702035645,1702467115,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

So much better to play with friends and to make things even better, servers can allow sizeable parties both with randoms and without. You can also host private lobbies to maintain a PVE environment instead of being forced into PVP situations always. There are several customisation options for your server experience (if you are the host) that can change how the world is handled.

At this point my only criticism of the game is that there is no way to share your private server with friends so they can join whenever they want to work on things. This is fairly common with most games like this (Sons Of The Forest for example) but I know it is entirely possible to make a server shareable amongst friends who have been given access to it (Grounded).

First the negatives to get it out of the way

-Save function is confusing and clunky and made me lose an hour of progress
Dont use the save option in the pause menu, game autosaves when you leave the game via pause menu!
-Combat is clunky and some zombies are WAY too hard (the fattys need like 562147532167 arrows to the head to die....WTF)
-Zombies in the area immediately respawn when you reload (they should add an option to mark my base or at least dont let them respawn where i saved the game / set up a camp)

Actually thats it so far for real negatives. Of course it still have little stutters here and there but its an EA game so nevermind.
Positives .... I cant make a complete list its too much xD. I just write down whats coming to my head right now
Crafting is fun, looting is fun, exploring is fun, building is fun....
1st AND 3rd person view! If you get annoyed by too strong zombies there is a way to use cheats ingame (ALT+shift+o)
You can increase the damage you dealing. (its more like a decrease in difficulty for combat and it made it more enjoyable for me PERSONALLY).
Also very positive, you can choose a big or a smaller map.
Tutorial could be a little more clear though ;)

Im really really excited whats ther to come as it is exactly what i was looking for, for a long long time....Just a little clunky ATM.
Will definetly play some more the next days and will be waiting excited for more updates.

These guys just go too far beyond ""suspend disbelief"".

Maybe they will grow up a bit in 6 months but, as it stands, a zombie that can take 14 arrows and 10 AK rounds (TO THE HEAD) is not what i can even call ""game"" believable as it stands.

Although this game is in Early Access and it's a little rough around the edges.  If you are a Zombie Survival game enthusiast, then this game is for you.  I've played so many.  Everything from H1Z1, 7D2D, SCUM, and DayZ, to Project Zomboid , HumantiZ, and Jaws of Extinction, plus many others.  This game is a diamond in the rough, and yes it still is a little rough around the edges, but it feels like it's taken a lot of good things from other Zombie Survival games, and mashed them all together in the one game. Of which they did a good job making it work together quite well. I've enjoyed every minute of it.  Looting, exploring, base building, zombie slaying, item creation, getting mauled by bears and wolves, and even had a blast trying to kill a super zombie only to be shredded by it.  This game provides a lot of fun stuff for a decent price tag, and I would have honestly paid more for it if I had known how much stuff is already in this game.

The Dev is actively updating the game, and they have been taking suggestions for content to add to the game.  This could possibly be the Zombie Survival game I've been waiting for, for a long time.  It even has multiplayer, but the solo game is just as fun.  If you're on the fence on whether you should get the game, I'd say go for it if you like these types of games.  

TLDR; 
I've had a blast with this game that is only in early access. It's a little rough around the edges, but if you like Zombie Survival games with base building and open world exploration, then this game would be right up your alley.



100+ Hour Update: 

So I now have well over hundred hours in the game, and I can say I still enjoy the game very much. I play every now and then, amongst other games I play. The game still receives regular updates. The guns sound and feel good.  New Map is coming along pretty well.  It's still a little empty, but the map is much larger, and so it's gonna require a bit of time to flesh out, plus it's larger so there are a lot more open woods and wild lands. Still the game is steadily become less rough, and is becoming more of a polished gem.  I can't wait to see how far the Developer can go with this game.  There are some bugs, and it needs a little optimization, but that's pretty standard for any Early Access games, and they regularly update with bug fixes. That's why they are in Early Access, to polish them up through player feedback.",1675021816,1701800274,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

The weapons and mods to them are nice and give quite a few options though I think the smaller SMG should be able to occupy a single-hand slot (only two slots are available for long guns, bows, spears, and large swords.

The weather and seasons are well done and the option settings are nice. There is an 'admin' screen for those that want to free build and give themselves equipment.

The map is large, and the vehicles while needing a little tweeking are pretty good with more vehicles in the future.

I've played a LOT of survivalcraft style games, and I've got to say that NOS is hands down one of my favorites. Getting this out of the way up front: It's a wonky lil game, though I personally find that the wonk typically adds to the the charm. There are few if any gamebreaking bugs  at this stage and most of the oddness comes from unusual translation choices (Press F for CLOSURE), various odd animations and some, interesting physics (sideswipe your truck with a pushcart and it will flip over) but The dev is constantly updating and i can see a lot of these things being corrected soon (tho i hope the engrish sticks around).

Now for the good: Where to start... NOS just feels perfectly crafted to scratch that S.C. itch. Base building is well balanced and scales well, with expensive some new automation structures added recently to provide endgame goals. The combat is adjustable so you can find your comfort level, with an optional horde rush that offers tower defense style gameplay to basebuilding. The map is HUGE and surprisingly beautiful, encourages exploration very well, with various resources being more readily available in various sections so you end up building more bases. The survival aspect of the game is challenging without being exceedingly tedious; NOS lifts aspects from a few other games (such as moodles from Project Zomboid) to great effect. Even the typically tedious aspect of inventory management scales with your experience as you can find (and eventually craft) larger backpacks to fill your handcart or truck with, and by mid to late game you're driving around a mobile warehouse. There's also the all important Psychic Pack Carry ""bug"" which helps tremendously and has become a stable gameplay feature by this point lol. 

All in all No One Survived is a sleeper hit, a charming game with hidden depth you can easily get lost in, and one I HIGHLY recommend and at sixteen dollars an absolute steal.",1701328138,1701328138,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Yes I get that this game is early access, but it is still not at a level that could justify anyone spending money on it.
Keep in mind that I run this game on it's highest graphical settings, and before you ask, yes my computer can handle it.
Graphics and rendering are terrible: 
- Trees will constantly appear and disappear in the distance as you traverse the terrain.
- Small rocks and shrubbery will only render when you are within 10 metres or so from them.
- Same deal for shadows. Half of the environment will have shadows, the other half will appear in close proximity.
- Once again, understanding that this is early access, the wall textures are still an absolute joke.
Some of the wall textures on building are shameful. If you actually get up close, they look like they have been imported from the first Half-Life game. Just a complete pixelated mess. For those of you unaware, Half-Life was made in 1998.

Gibbing animations:
- The damage inflicted by certain weapons is inaccurate with the calibre on weaponry you are using.
e.g. Shooting a zombie in the head with an arrow will make their head completely explode. This goes for arms and legs too.
- If you shoot the head off of a zombie with hair, the hair will come loss of the severed head as if ti were a solid wig.
- Killing some zombies will also cause them to go into a glitched state as if they are being sucked into a small black hole.

Travel:
When playing co-op, be prepared to spawn on the opposite side of the map to each other. Sure, this is normal in games like DayZ and 7 Days, but the big difference is stamina and scenery.
- Stamina depletes very quickly and regenerates very slowly.
- There's an ""Auto-Run"" button, but it's not auto sprint. So you're practically doing a brisk walk. On top of that, the moment you open you inventory/map it stops walking. You can press it again while it's open, but just overall annoying and slow.
- While moving at a snails pace through this map just hoping to find a car, you will mostly just enjoy the view of a poorly rendered environment I mentioned above. Even when you get to a town, they are still very basic and unimpressive.

Here are some other bits just to wrap up this review:
- Very limited and poor character customisation. Good luck picking a colour for your hair with their dodgy colour wheel. I also hope you don't mind only picking Asian eyes, cause that is the only choice you have.
- You spawn in with a bow, gun, knife, machete and hammer. Taking away the initial fun and excitement of finding your first weapons.
- Very poor iron-sights on guns. Yes, breathing is an aspect of getting a steady and accurate shot, but your character seems to be incapable of lining up the front and rear sights for more than 2 seconds.

So that is a summary of my 36 minute experience with this game. I could tell this game was trash from the moment I loaded into a map, although I was still down for giving it a shot. 36 minutes was clearly all I needed to put this game in the bin. My mate and I both got refunds as we would rather put our time into functional zombie survival games.

I was going to make a pros list, but the very limited 'Pros' in this game are done much better in other open world zombie survival games. Check out any of the following games as they have a variety of different play styles and get alot of things right that this game did wrong.
Try: '7 Days to Die', 'DayZ' (Either Arma mod or standalone), 'DeadPoly', 'State of Decay', 'How to Survive' and 'The Forest'.

- Some of the zombies are just bullet sponges but nothing to make it a fun fight...just keep shooting it and sometimes move to the side to avoid their predictable attack.

Note: This game can always be improved one way or another depending on your view of the game.
Note2: If your computer is good enough to run it, you will find some enjoyment out of it one way or another.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Other than that I personally and I truly feel that ""No One Survived"" takes many of the aspects from your favorite survival games then puts many aspects of them into an incredibly fun and a very enjoyable and balanced very fun Zombie survival game in my own view, here is the following things about the game i like personally,
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 I do love that crafting and building is not too crazy, while not being not overly demanding and unrealistic along with pretty fair grinding you can build a cool base, you can even turn on creative mode and build as must you want. creative mode needs turned on each time to save quit and re-join the game.

 I do love the skill / technology system where you need to find books to learn skills, which is nice to say say the least.

 I do love  the weapons and attachments, which all are useful in their own ways.

 I do love the vehicles/driving system, oh though it could use improvements one way or another.

 I do love the base building which is nice and you can build unlimited bases if you wish.

 I do love  the zombies in this game, which are easy or hard depending on the settings you pick.

 I do love  the map and the looting system.

 I do love  on how this game feels like it since has own style on pve or pvp, while you can play with your friends/family or alone in singleplayer if you wish too and you can even use  an admin panel to use at any time on your own server/singleplayer games.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 I got done playing this game with the feeling the need to recommend this game to all my friends/family for their own fun and enjoyment and for them to also create a review for the game when they are ready.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Please! Don't judge this game so much  by its EA flaws alone or even the reviews alone, Really try to give it a chance and you'll find an amazing experience where your looking at the clock and it is 5 hours later than when you started playing it while playing naked with clothes on, then you go dang time dang sure flies when your having fun while playing a game naked with clothes on.

Bottom line is, Its more your lost then anyone's else lost if you don't get the game which means you could miss out on something that you might enjoy. You shouldn't judge the game based on reviews alone, because they do not give the full picture that you will see playing the game which is why i say,

Try Playing the game for yourself and judge it based on your own view instead because of most of the negative reviews are full of Delusions, make no mistake most of the negative reviews are full of more Delusions then, ""A woman in labor thinking it will go painless without drugs""

The tutorial is very basic but complete and gives an overview of a game that is heavily inspired by Tarkov in terms of inventory management and search system, a good idea if it worked well in the game world.

The game world is fixed, it is not possible to generate a new map as is the case for example with 7 Days to die (which I consider the best zombie survival on steam), there are two maps available one of 64x64km and the other of 16x16, all this space is poorly used because the majority of the then is almost empty or with totally inert and non-interacting furnishings. What is interactible are mainly the boxes and these have few patterns available so they are easy to recognize. 

Besides this lack of interacting objects, the other thing that left me very puzzled despite the use of UE5 is the ugliness of the interior. The textures (at very high detail) are of poor quality, which is not usually a problem, but in this case they further exacerbate the feeling of incompleteness, the buildings also are strange, there are pipes suspended in the air that go nowhere, industrial plants worthy of a steel mill built inside barns, my impression was that they are assets put there randomly with no apparent logic such as with the crane that is missing a piece totally absent in its surroundings or even more absurd the car that has the doors smashed to the ground but also has them properly fitted.
 
I attach a few screenshots taken in game to corroborate what I wrote.

However, despite its shift to Unreal Engine 5, the game's environment still feels somewhat outdated. While scavenging through a city house (albeit with significant lag), the interior's graphics left something to be desired. It's hard to believe this is Unreal Engine 5.

The combat system is rather lacking in design. On the plus side, the zombies look impressive, with animations that outshine most other zombie games. Unfortunately, the combat experience falls a bit short.

Chopping trees and mining ores can be quite the challenge due to the first-person perspective and animation design. Getting the right angle feels like a constant struggle.

The inventory system is not a personal favorite. It's grid-based and includes a weight limit. This setup seems somewhat peculiar. Why not consider returning to the traditional system with a weight limit and infinite space, or opting for a grid-based system with no weight limit if the grid itself serves as the limiting factor?

The game feels like a blend of The Forest, 7 Days To Die, and State of Decay. There's definite potential here, but the graphics of the buildings need an overhaul, especially in the city areas, which appear rather lackluster. On the bright side, it's hard to complain at the $16.99 price point.

Happier now you fixed my saved games so I could go back if I died without losing everything since the big patch messed up so much. I lost my previous game all together. I am not PC savvy to go into the background to find it like some said.  Tried big island but it was too laggy and falling through the earth all the time and distance to run was long with not much to see so waiting for game to make it better meanwhile I enjoy the smaller island. The buildings on big island would be nicer if different to small island. Maybe like English country villages or similar?

I like the building dynamic where you lay down a wire frame and fill it in.  Coop is my thing and that changes up the building to make it more cooperative then most games like this.

On a side note devs: Please add a function to keep zombies from spawning within the base for horde night. Maybe add range to the safezone table and add the function to it?

As mentioned im 50 hours in and thats for a good reason this is adictive and all be it a little flakey on the edges which is expected for a Beta, this game has potential to blow up massively.

Good Points.

1. Graphics are amazing for a game at this stage. Weather is spot on, character could do with more detail though to match its surrounding, still good as most games.

2. Survival Mechanics. This although similar to other survival games seems to bring the best of all into one. can be expanded if required.

3. Use of NPCs. Although relevantly new addition, it brings new life to the game and excited to see what can be done with this.

4. Building. Some aspects could do with polishing like clipping, but overall very good mechanic and visuals, again excited to see what PVE builds come out of this in the future.

5. Addictive and satisfying. The loot aspect of this game is well balanced and keeps you looking and reorganising your inventory. 

Negative or changes required/added

This section will obviously have more points due to the game in Beta, but will be constructive.

 1. Horde Nights. A good consept and 7D2D nailed it, NOS doesnt have a benefit of fitting horde, you waste ammo for little useful loot, ended up dying and letting horde despawn and carrying on as normal. Maybe special progressive loot or trinkets etc.

2. Lockable toolbar. The amount of time i would swap bags or pickup dead body and tool bar not as set, Went to shoot zombie and swung a stone knife instead lol.

3. Traits. Another great aspect that can be expanded, maybe a music trait and instruments to be able to uplift mood.

4. Learning Trait. This if done as designed is a very long process and some people just dont have the time to read every book. If used with (3) then would benefit a multiplayer scenario. At the moment you can just read until mood to low and commit suicide and spawn at pre made bed and carry on.....

5.  Unlocks. With the above in mind, each level in a trait should unlock something else eg food quality and benefits, special mods for Guns for example.

6.  Maps. Map markers are a standard nowadays and think it should be implemented here for sure. 

7. Traders. again a great addition and has fantastic potential.  Aspect of tasks for mission items is a good start i think.

8. Clothing. Pockets...... im mean come on how will you keep your hands warmer... and store fibre

9. Degradation. i have seen this in food and armour/clothes being worn, how about ammo left in rain, or weapons jamming or parts breaking.... weapon repair kits utilising gun oil and broken down guns.

10.  Night Vision goggles.....

11. Expand cave complex for future developments this has great potential utilising (10)

12. ADS. Still needs work but is playable at the moment. 

13. Inventory management.  Transfer all option. Transfer all type. Sort button to have everything together (Nuggets ahhhh)

14. Mods. If not on horizon or implemented this helps grow a product if working closely with Modders.

Overall i am very satisfied with this game and am looking forward to future updates. further reviews to follow as required.

Thankyou for all the hard work so far.",1697553678,1697976865,True,10,0,0.588398456573486328,0,True,False,True

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        8/10 и потенциально лучшая игра в жанре Выживания в открытом мире. Однозначно советую всем любителям жанра!


Having conditionally completed the game (having received all the achievements and tried all the content), I unexpectedly discovered the best survivalist in the open world! The game was made on UE5 and this is the BEST work on this engine that I have come across since its release. I played the game in version 0.0.5.1 and despite such an early build, the game runs stably at high settings at 60FPS (with my not very strong PC - i5 6600 and GTX 1070). There were no critical errors or crashes at all, and there were hardly a dozen cases of some minor bugs, over almost 80 hours of play.

     No less than the technical part, I was amazed by the content of the game. Having seen such an early version of the game in the main menu, I prepared myself for 2-3 hours of barely working content. But no! A huge map with a bunch of interesting places, enemies of various appearances and abilities, the change of seasons (with all the attendant consequences), transport, crafting items, construction (even settlements with NPCs) - ALL this and even more is in the game and it fully works!

     Of course, don’t forget that the game is in Early Access. Moreover, very early. The developers release monthly updates, but the final stage is far from complete and many game mechanics, although fully functional, are in their infancy. Unfortunately, there are no game modes other than “Survival”, and the entire plot is limited to a short introductory text at the beginning of survival.
     However, the worst thing is with the enemies. Wild animals may not hear a driving car or a character walking past them at night, but somehow they can notice a character sneaking behind buildings from a distance of 50-70 meters. Bandits, half the time, don’t care about killing other bandits in front of them, but such blindness does not prevent them from hitting a character from a great distance. And of course zombies who are not perceived as zombies. These seemingly rotten corpses have excellent hearing (they can hear a character sneaking from the street on the fourth floor), good eyesight (from a great distance they can see a character through a hole in the wall) and if they notice, then until death they will know exactly the location of the player and the shortest route. There's no way to hide from zombies or trick them, and it's simply impossible to escape from most types of zombies. Without transport, the only way to break away is from slow zombies. With everyone else, it’s either fight or die.
     The only thing that is even worse is the enemy spawn system. I hope that this is just a temporary measure. Now, there are enemy spawn points scattered around the map with a re-spawn timer, and around the player character there is a zone in which enemies can exist (about 100 meters). In total, this leads to the fact that the first appearance in the location will greet the player with a large crowd of strong enemies, but if the player accidentally (or deliberately) leaves the location, then upon returning back only a few weak enemies will be waiting for him, since all other enemies are on cooldown appearance. This same feature prevents you from occupying ready-made rooms and locations on the map, since when you restart the game, all the enemies in full force will appear again and will most likely kill the player. I lost my character this way, after clearing the village, saving and exiting the game in one of the houses.

     The game has problems, comments, and moments that are downright annoying. However, they are all superficial and are explained by the Early Access factor. Enemy behavior, balance and bugs can be fixed with patches. Much more important is the basis of the game, and it is both technically and gameplay - Amazing! The developers have done an excellent job on their game, they continue to refine it, and I am more than confident that when it releases, No One Survived will become the best game in the open world survival genre.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Условно пройдя игру (получив все достижения и попробовав весь контент), неожиданно открыл для себя лучший выживач в открытом мире! Сделана игра на UE5 и это САМАЯ лучшая работа на этом движке, что мне попадалась с момента его релиза. Проходил игру в версии 0.0.5.1 и несмотря на столь ранний билд игра стабильно работает на высоких настройках в 60FPS (при моем не самом сильном ПК - i5 6600 и GTX 1070). Критических ошибок и вылетов не было вовсе, а случаев каких-то незначительных багов наберется едва ли с десяток, за почти 80 часов игры.

    Не меньше технической части, меня поразило наполнение игры. Увидев в главном меню столь раннюю версию игры, я приготовил себя к едва рабочему контенту часа на 2-3. Но нет! Огромная карта с кучей интересных мест, разнообразные внешне и по способностям враги, смена сезонов года (со всеми сопутствующими последствиями), транспорт, крафт предметов, строительство (вплоть до поселений с НПС) - ВСЕ это и еще большее есть в игре и оно полностью работает!

    Конечно, не стоит забывать что игра в Раннем доступе. При том в очень раннем. Разработчики ежемесячно выпускают обновления, но до финала далеко и многие игровые механики, хоть и полностью работают, но находятся в зачаточном состоянии. К сожалению нет режимов игры кроме ""Выживания"", а весь сюжет ограничен коротким вступительным текстом в начале выживания.
    Однако, хуже всего дела обстоят с врагами. Дикие звери могут не услышать едущую машину или идущего ночью мимо них персонажа, но как-то могут заметить крадущегося за постройками персонажа с расстояния в 50-70 метров. Бандитам, в половине случаев, плевать на убийство других бандитов у них на глазах, однако такая слепота не мешает им попадать по персонажу с большого расстояния. И конечно зомби, которые не воспринимаются как зомби. Эти, казалось бы, гнилые трупы имеют отличный слух (слышат с улицы крадущегося на четвертом этаже персонажа), неплохое зрение (с большой дистанции могут увидеть персонажа через пролом в стене) и если заметят, то до самой смерти будут точно знать местоположение игрока и кратчайший маршрут. Спрятаться от зомби или обмануть их нельзя, а сбежать от большинства типов зомби просто невозможно. Без транспорта, оторваться выйдет только от медленных зомби. Со всеми прочими остается либо драться, либо умирать.
    Еще хуже сделана разве что система спавна врагов. Надеюсь что это всего лишь временная мера. Сейчас же, по карте разбросаны точки появления врагов с таймером повторного появления, а вокруг персонажа игрока есть зона в которой могут существовать враги (примерно метров 100). В сумме это приводит к тому, что первое появление в локации встретит игрока большой толпой сильных врагов, но если игрок случайно (или специально) покинет локацию, то по возвращении обратно его будет ждать всего несколько слабых врагов, так как все остальные враги в перезарядке на появление. Эта же особенность не дает занимать готовые помещения и локации на карте, так как при перезапуске игры все враги в полном составе появятся снова и скорее всего убьют игрока. Сам так терял персонажа, после зачистки деревни, сохранении и выходе из игры в одном из домов.

    В игре есть и проблемы, и замечания, и моменты которые откровенно бесят. Однако все они поверхностны и объясняются фактором Раннего доступа. Поведение врагов, баланс и баги можно исправить патчами. Намного важнее основа игры, а она и технически, и геймплейно - Изумительна! Разработчики проделали великолепную работу над своей игрой, продолжают ее дорабатывать и я более чем уверен, что на релизе No One Survived станет самой лучшей игрой в жанре ""Выживание в открытом мире""",1696369935,1697108448,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Zombie movement is weird AF atm, guns feel good to shoot but have horrible ADS.
The building isnt bad, but needs work still. Can be very clunky especially with the roofs.
Inventory is a mess and so is the storage system. I do like the realistic feel, of oh you cant just carry 5k logs or stones, so thats fine, but man some items just take to much space (Clothes, weapons) Also the storage is very limited atm, and in a small group of 3 of us, we need SO MANY containers, and shelves for logs, planks, sticks. I feel like those could bend the realism a bit more.
The horde night or whatever you wanna call it also needs ALOT of work, while early on its nice and pretty simple, but man only 1-2 waves? last maybe 5-10min once you get a base and some basic defense up seems blah. Its one reason 7 days to die get so boring in end game, you get setup and its like ugh ok everything even modded gets way to easy.

I will say the survival parts, with food and what not are actually pretty good. I enjoy the cooking while you have baseline like 1 meat 2 veggies, the options for food are pretty good for the limited ingredinents atm.
I would like to see the fridge do better at keeping the food fresh and maybe even adding like a deep freezer to store food longer down the road.

However atm I would say i couldnt recommend it, until things get worked out more and polished. While I understand 7 days to die has taken 10yrs to get to where its at, I pray this game can make some better strides faster, as it does actually have the potiental to dethrone 7dtd if the devs put the work in!

I understand they were going with the whole crafting survival like 7 days to die, the forest, green hell and etc. But to really put a game out there. You need the basic of understanding. To any survivalist shelter is the first go to, then food and supply rationalizing is priority after finding a place to camp and hold out until the morning arrives. But a true survivalist has no bounds, learning the land, know when to go and prepare, and learn how to use whatever means to your advantage. So far this game is okay, spent like a few minutes.

Pros: 
1) very in depth (slow) crafting progressions system (not complicated and everything makes sense)
2) very large window of difficulty. there are dozens of detailed settings just like 7 days to die has.
3) the cars are actually not bad comparatively

Cons:
1) fps tanks whenever someone respawns or joins the server.

It's a bit too cartoony right now. I do like the building mechanic on here. Getting to see what everything will look like before you get all the pieces put in is a nice little addition. using gun's and the bow is a little awkward, but again, still just starting out. It's pretty cool.

EDIT: I just tried playing a new character again and this time I had an option for a ""beginners pack""? I don't remember that being given the first time I played. I remember having to search for everything first, the beginner pack was alright, but I then went up against a bear. I didn't see animals in the first play through I did, which is fine, if the bear's weren't built like tanks instead of actual bears lol. I believe if I shot a bear with an arrow in his nose, or up his nose, he would've freaked out and ran away lol. The nose is a really sensitive part on a bear. Anyway, I filled the bear with 10 arrows, 4 slashes from the given bowie knife, and 3 stabs from the metal spear that was in the pack, I then hurled the spear and stuck it into the upper left side of the bear, and it still didn't slow it down, or even seem to take it's health down much, and I'm playing on ""Beginner"" difficulty lol. 

Secondly in order to pick up rocks from the ground in the beginning section It seemed as if I needed to look STRAIGHT down in order to pick up the rocks, and not have the slightest angle in sight line. That made picking things up feel a bit wonky since I was constantly having to look straight, look straight down, look straight, look straight down. Thank god I don't get motion sickness very easily, or get sick from being in a boat lol. 

The game seems to want to LEAN HEAVILY into the DAY Z territory and if that's the case it's not the game for me. If that is the INTENTION of the developers then I think they are on the proper path since I suck horribly at DAY Z and don't play it anymore. It's not my idea of a good time lol. They seem to throw in traders though which is a lot like ""7 Days to Die"" which I LOVE to play lol. So, i'm not 100% on what exactly the developers are trying to do now lol. 

Building still feels a bit awkward although I will say they do give a very expansive tutorial that you can go through in the very beginning in order to get better at these skills, but don't expect to come from DAY Z or 7 Days to Die and just be able to wreck someone lol. I do like the fact that you can choose to be a part of PvP when you start your game in stead of it always having a PvP element no matter where you begin. I personally want to experience the world and not have it interupted by people that have fun ruining game play, or griefing, other players. so I appreciate that aspect greatly. 

The load and reload function on the game still throws me for a loop. To me it seems natural that if I pull a gun out to use that I would be thinking about that ammunition at the same time so reloading wouldn't rely on me moving bullets from a box, to a magazine, to loading that magazine, to charging handle, then firing. All of those motions would be second nature as a real human and not designated tasks we have to go through. To put it in a better way, while I was deployed to Iraq I didn't think about reloading, it just happened. I just naturally did it because it was part of the necessary function and not something I had to really concentrate on. So, the firearms in the game seem to make reloading a bit more tedious than it actually needs to be, That's just my opinion though. 

Graphically it seems to look a bit more toned down, but has a bit more UMPH to it. I don't really know how to describe it. It seems that they are definitely putting work into the game though. The trader was a welcomed and suprising part I came across. In time I think this will turn into something great, but whether it's a DAY Z great, 7 Days to Die great, or it's OWN great, is still yet to be determined.",1675548491,1695287976,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

First off, it spawns you in random places EVERY TIME if you're not the host. Does not matter if you set your bed as a respawn camp or make a safe zone. We spent hours building a base on my friends server. I come back today and all my character info is GONE. As a player in someone else's server, you have no option to manual save (yes I know if you hit the esc button, it SHOULD be on top of ""unstuck char"" well it's not). It is the only character I made and was playing on so no it was not a different character and I did not die. My friend even manually saved (he can because it is his server) before we quit the game for the night but today, I join and I am just a new participant with no items that I had looted, no skills that I had trained, ever existing in his server. So yeah, if you want a game where only the hosts gets to keep his saved items and all make your friends make new characters every time, then this is the crap game for you! Maybe it had to do with hosting a ""private server"" versus a ""multiplayer"" server, am not sure and do not care to explore because to switch between the two modes, you have to reload your entire game. What kind of backwards 2001 bullcrap is that? 

The gameplay itself is crap and clunky. You can swim indef under water and never come up for air or take any damage (you know.. like drowning?) or even use any stamina but you swing 3 times at a tree, you're winded! So if you wanna pretend to be a mermaid, great game!  Goodluck putting a roof over your house, even though we built the columns and beams, it only took a good hour of bullcrap standing in the exactly right spot to position a centerrpiece of our roof on (EVEN THO IT'S A SQUARE PIECE, GO AHEAD AND ROTATE IT AND THEN IT SNAPS INTO PLACE. That's how we finally got it on). If you do happen to die, all your beginner bullcrap like your backpack and bow will stay FOREVER but anything you looted in the game disappears while you run the distance of the entire map in 30+ minutes to get back to your character or friends because there isn't a way to spawn near your friends or your safe zone or your bed (yeah! 30 plus minutes! Cause on land, you are an overweight-10packs a year smoking-one lunged individual who needs to replenish your infant stamina every few seconds (but in the water, you are God).

- Zombie health set at NORMAL can be a hit or miss, kill a zombie with two hits with a spear or itll use all of your spear's durability. Or you'll come across a boss zombie that'll run your mood every time you run into a town. Incredibly inconsistent.
- I can easily grab myself a rifle from the military base with little zombie action, but Im swarmed by 10 zombies at a town. Spawns are absurd.
- Horribly optimized, I need to turn on DLSS or ill have sudden frame drops, and the graphics thats shown in gameplay? Must have the illumination enabled, that runs my fps down to 60. Mind you I run a 4070 Ti + i7-12700f 1440p.
- Don't even bother to stealth, you hit a zombie with a weapon and somehow almost every zombie in a 100ft radius will run after you. Their senses are boosted by 10x.
- Sound quality is horrible, as if there wasn't any elbow grease put into them, making it feel far less immersive.

I really want to enjoy this game, on paper it sounds fun, sandbox zombie survival game very similar to 7 days to die. But after playing, it feels as this game is a college project.

2. Random respawn instead of at your home.  You spend a lot of time running around.
3. Not sure if you can recover your stuff when you die.  I died each time I tried to return.

Animations are generally good.  Throwing spear, shooting arrows, etc.  Still a bit clunky but acceptable. I have not experienced any ""fall through the world"" kind of bugs.

This is grindy co-op game or single game with great building options.

World creation settings helps to adjust your world playstyle you like,
Hunt more or kill zombies more, deal with waves or more building and farming routine .

I really recommend these CORE setting for newcomer's to save time .
Zombies > Hard-Hardcore
Zombies spawn > X3 - X4
Loot amount > High - Very high
Year duration > 80Days or the mid option
*Dont go Above 50% runner zombies*

The fact that your mostly free to do w\e come up to your head is something that not every game can offer to you,
For example iv just built a damn bridge lol (Yes it took nice amount of time and patience)
Bottom line i would suggest this game totally worth the price , 80-200 hours for sure hehe's and haha's on the way.




It has loads of Cons and ill lie if i didnt ALT F4 nad said FK that shit but eventually i came back to finish my buisness lol.

-It can randomly crash
-Animation can sometimes stack on ""searching a box"" but will go away
-While your driving some places has bad pixels or w\e so you can stuck or demage your car for no reason (good example on bridges near trains or corpses)
-The sound of braking car can stay after braking and wont go away so you must to break again so it stops
-Dissapearing loot ( while searching a box it may show your for 0.5 sec the loot and disappear or duplicate your last box )
-In very close distance sometimes your bullets even shotgun wont harm zombies so you must step away
-Even with silencer zombies may come to you from other side of the location 

Right now iv learned the breeding pan but it doesnt show in the building workshop menu XD etc.


Great game base to develop waiting for updates :D

To summarize:
No One Survived is a game with a shallow premise, exactly zero explanation on how to progress on the crafting tree, zombies, and the story is precisely 2 sentences long. but also: PHYSICS!
This game plays like a poor midpoint between 7 Days To Die and Rust. It has all of the bad parts from both of those games, with none of the good parts.
It is very pretty as far as graphics and physics are concerned, and it has enough realism in the crafting tree that it makes you need to manage your inventory.

picking up items items from the floor is so difficult that it would be easier to buy the things you want. Tool collisions are so bad that axes quantum teleport through the tree you're chopping. Sound engineering is absent; the devs straight up ripped sounds from other games, so that maybe when you hear them you'll be like ""oh yeah, that is maybe what that's supposed to sound like"". The player character moves so clunky, it may as well be a walrus. But, again, it's visually pretty.",1688597131,1688597169,False,14,2,0.493127405643463135,0,True,False,True

Game is lacking a-lot at this stage of the game.
Dev is not fixing current issues with the game.
Dev puts ai bandit camps in that DO NOT have new and or rare materials.
Materials are the same you can find elsewhere in the game.
These Ai bandit camps are also not marked locations they don't show up at all on the map.
Cars still have not been fixed.
Nothing really new in almost a year for the building system.
Dev is NOT repeat is NOT listening to the community on the needed items and building pieces that should have been in the game from the start.
While the Ai Bandit camps are cool as far as the buildings go a new car and a new van are there but you can't loot or use them.
New cars and clean models have been repeatedly asked for by the community.
There are still no clean and or new models we can use yet.
No new lighting and so forth I mean the list goes on and on.
I was told by a Mod for the Dev that if it don't go with the vision of the dev that it won't be added in Well DEV let me make something Very Clear to you:
We the community support this project of yours once released it's no longer just about what you want or don't want in the game. So add the items and fix the things that we have asked for over and over or your game will fail simple as that.
Community warning if you go to the discord page do not even talk to Robo there this person is rude and very disrespectful.

Early Review:
It's pretty cool so far.
Does still need some work.
Need to have a tow truck to haul at least two or three cars at a time.
This way you could get one not have to run across the map to pick they other car or truck up that you find and repair. Two this would also help when collecting supplies.

however,

the tutorial is worthless
the grafics (maxed out) are horrible
the building/crafting system is the worst i have ever seen

the entire game looks pretty much like a game from  10 years ago 
it starts, it stutters even on a great gaming system

the map is huge
you can actually access a map (many games have no map)
there are PLENTY of things to do. you will not be bored

in closing, it takes a special skill set to be able to make unreal 5 look and play this bad. 

i build unreal assets and environments for a living.  first month builders can make a much better looking world than this with free assets from the store.

Okay, maybe that's a little aggressive, but in its current state it's not ready for this store. It'll do fine on indie platforms.

My 20 minutes:
• Most character customization settings don't work at all
• Main menu showed no settings button when the language was set to Dutch. Instead the button was named ""Karakter aanpassen"" (Customize character) 10/10 translation
[i]10 minutes later my friend and I were finally playing together[/i]
• Got greeted with terrible performance on a GTX 1080
• Met a bear with infinite health
• Entered a shack and found 30 lootable drawers side by side (I should have taken a screenshot, it looked way too over the top)
• Accidentally killed a friend even though PVP was switched off
• He respawned at the other side of the island
• He then decided to swim, proceeded to stream the game on Discord to show himself playing Jesus while floating above the water
• Meanwhile I got attacked by a boar and a wolf which I guess they can take 10 bullets to the face

It's supposed to be a zombie game, but no matter where I looked, I haven't encountered any. Maybe that's for the better...

Don't get me wrong the idea is fantastic, the execution on the other hand has made me decide never to buy another EA game again.

Simply put, i rent a server to play with friends, ping is average 80 and spikes when someone joins, sometimes you can run and you can bug it so you still run and gain stamina back, and other times it's like your running on a treadmill going no where fast, and using stamina....

Now to the GFX which is pretty decent tbh and the Lightning effects are probably the best iv'e seen in a game, but the flickering of trees as you go near or away from, is a little off putting no matter what setting i use (i7 13th 13700k + RTX 3070 i have).

The menu sounds, i mean what's that crackle when i first load up? not just me having that issue. and the clothes i'm wearing as i select the char can change, even though i haven't changed them in game.

The car...what can i say...i fix it 100% fill with fuel and drive, going up a hill, the speed drops so badly i struggle to get up some of them, and steering feels laggy, and don't try and run something over, your car will come off worst, i tried jumping in the car on Hoarde night and thought it would be fun to run them over, epic fail... they are like hitting brick walls and you can't drive away, yup i died.

The sleep timer jumps back and forth so you never really know when you click the X to come out, or what time it will land on, unless you let it leave it all the way. Zeds hitting your spike fences can suddenly shoot up in the air and land in the base, chopped a tree down once...it hit a cabin, span round a few times and shot towards me and killed me...tried hitting a tree on the ground which seemed to be bobbing a little? it hit me and i died.

This game needs a lot of attention before it can even be called EA, i really wanted to like this game, so i will be waiting for updates to hopefully they can sort these issues out.

Personally i can't give a positive review in this state, but would change it if things improve, i recommend you save your money till a few more updates come out.

I will say a few things would be nicer, such as the ability to consume items at least while sitting but maybe while laying too. Being able to revive fellow 'party' or team members if close (like 3-5 seconds to be able to). Another thing is regrowing trees. It would be nice to be able to turn the horde on and off after the creation of the game, and hell if you could swing it (I know it is asking a lot) allow the difficulty level to be changed after creation as well. The things that need to be fixed before I return to this game are the mutant and animal spawning rates need to be changeable. Head shots should be 1-2 maybe even 3 bullets at most for all enemies. Loot even if it is written in as very abundant is scarce, at almost every area. Guns and bows react too slowly, and often times take multiple presses of a button to register. There are quite a few area's I have not been, but car repair kits are nightmarishly rare compared to the amount of cars, yet gas is overly abundant? This is the end of my points.


(I have yet to play this far into the game yet because something prevents me every single time, but I am going to go out on a whim and say the car parts should be able to create a car at some point?) Another note, Ever since the latest updates the game has been more glitchy, as well as rainbow plaid-like patterns, almost like the game's mesh is poking out. Cars, houses, trees, the ground, you name it and it has most likely glitched with that weird rainbow mesh texture. It almost makes me sick to look at. 
I know the game will be glitchy anyways due to the graphics of the game, but I have mine all turned to the lowest that they can be. The only one I have Very High is the visual distance so I can register things walking up on me. Is there any way to fix that? Maybe it ties into the rainbow mesh.

Per their most recent update they practically addressed my issues. I appreciate that kinda thing
EDIT:
I love the game, but with lack of being able to contact the Devs, I must say the direction it has taken is really really bad. Perhaps if it were multiplayer and many players were shooting/hitting/killing a single zombie/infected I guess BUT, I put about 72 rounds into a new Fat zombie before killing it. No reward, no nothing. That is way to much, not to mention there isn't a roll/dodge/gtfo the way feature you are just in a simple *you gonna die* train ride. If an arrow to maybe three takes down a regular infected, Devs need to balance the damage scale for solo or even co-op play. This is not good. 
Second, I am finding guns in cars, not in boxes on military bases. This needs to be looked into. I will change my review back if the right things are looked into. Right now, I don't wanna play

I have really enjoyed my time with this game. It needs some polish, some additions here and there and some filling up of the sometimes empty space. Though the grind feels normal, I enjoy playing and look forward to future content. What I really appreciate is that it isn't PVP! I love this type of genre of game, though they always have some kinda PVP element that removes the fun for me personally!

There are a couple of features that are de rigueur, a French phrase meaning ""required by etiquette or usage or fashion,"" in any game that are notably lacking here.

Let's take HUD for example. A HUD is by definition: ""a status bar by which information is visually relayed to the player."" Every game I can think of since DOOM has a HUD. This game has no HUD. It shows a status but you have to TAB into a screen to see it, and when you do so you stop moving. The lack of this makes close combat with zombies intolerable. In this game you can die by hypothermia in cold weather and by dehydration in hot. I cannot count the number of times I just dropped while running across a field because there was no HUD indicating my health status. Here's a free clue for the devs: a HUD also usually includes a compass indication of some type.

Many indicators of trouble are indecipherable to a native English speaking gamer. Who knew that a red outline of a chicken leg means that you have food poisoning or ""feeling heat"" or ""feeling cold"" means you are dying from weather effects. Dammit when something is wrong GET MY ATTENTION!

Another expectation is to be able to locate my dropped pack after I die. In many cases when I die I am fighting and running with only a general idea of where I am. I expect a marker, visible on the map, that I can use to find my way to my pack and I expect to be able to make my way back, pick up my armor, weapons and loot and be on my merry. I think that has happened once or twice in this game and only if I die close to the respawn. Otherwise forget it. The marker should likewise be visible in the HUD. One should also be able to mark up the map, annotate it and put a reference point visible in the HUD.

A minor beef: when I ram a zombie dog with a vehicle I expect to hurt him NOT wreck the vehicle. The vehicles in this game take way too much damage from trivial bumps.

What I like. The food and water management is an interesting challenge but the cooking needs work. I do not have the time to open a bookmark in a browser to fandom to look for recipes. Do like many other games so right clicking on an inventory items shows you what is is used for.

The sounds and visuals of the environment are excellent. I really feel alone in the woods and when it raining or winter the effect if amplified. The building and manufacturing is well thought out. I have built every item in the game except the bee keeping one. I have chopped a lot of trees down but haven't found one honeycomb to build it.

All in all an interesting game but needs a lot of work.",1683832977,1683833066,False,40,7,0.720903933048248291,0,True,False,True

I had not played this style of zombie game before but had played Age of Empires and the like. I was lost at first but soon became comfortable with the mechanics of the game, (I have to use a controller/mouse/keyboard, most likely my issue, not good at that type of thing.)
 I bought this when it was about a week into the Beta so the game was not as full of zombies or special infected just the normal zombie but it was fun due to my inexperience. I would prefer 1st person but that is me not the games issue. 
 The building mechanics can be a bit difficult and annoying but that is something that i think will improve. 
On the single player option it would be good to have AI opponents who collect resources and you need to fight and defeat, (a little bit of Day Z action, they hunt you, you hunt them.) As well as hordes maybe a ""AI opponent"" night when they attack your base.
There are few issues with this game for me but  have not played the style before so there ma well be issue I don't know or notice. 
It would be nice when selling item that you just click and they go into the spot for selling or purchase. 
Health, nutrients etc do seem to go down quickly, so they could last a bit longer, four or five ""tinned food"" should last all day not a few hours.

This game takes a lot of elements from other survival games like DayZ and others. I think it is really well done and a nice new addition to possibly play with friends. I have yet to play on an online server or with people in the same world as me yet, but I think even though there are aspects of other games within this one it is pretty well done for what it is. The graphics are pretty, the gameplay is very focused on scavenging, building, farming, fighting off zombies etc. Now the game does have it's clunks like there are times I can't aim down sights in any view first or third with any gun, it usually bugs in and out and then if I pull out a different weapon or drop the weapon and retry it will work most times. I also think the camera angles should be a bit adjusted I had to mess with the fov to get the right camera angle for me, I also think there should be an option in the future for a changing of perspective from third person to being able to play majorly in first person. I love the third person aspect to it but it would be nice to play in first person view more. I understand this game is still new and being worked on.

When I first started playing it several months ago I had so much fun running around searching for stuff however the zombie spawns seemed a little slow and the numbers seemed a bit low.  I took a few weeks off since I got busy with work and then there was a new update which adjusted zombies and added in new and more zombies.   This addition and or fix I feel broke the feel of the game.

Now when ever we play the spawns and the amount of zombies that spawn on servers/multi player is way too much now.    I can clear out a gas station POI and literally with in minutes they spawn back.  I have been reading lots and lots of complaints similar to mine.  Also it seems there are mainly specialty zombies in most areas which you just can not out run.  They run faster than you, and are nothing but bullet sponges.    The other issue is bears just have way to many Hitpoints.  We unloaded a box of .44 rounds and steel arrows in to a bear and it did not even faze it.

I feel the spawn situation is drastically taking away from the game and in many cases from what I read are causing people to turn away from the game and not play it anymore because spawns are so ridiculous it makes the game almost unplayable in many cases.   You have to almost have a full group of elite equipped people just to go in to some of the POIs so they can watch you back as you loot because the zombies spawn back so quickly.  In fact in many cases they spawn in behind you.

From what I have heard and what I can tell the spawn system is done by distance.  When you clear a house or Gas station or any POI and head on to other one and come back through that POI the zombies are spawned back in before because of some kind of proximity trigger.  I am not sure exactly how the spawns work but it seems to be a combination of Proximity and timer.

I think the Devs need to implement more customization with in the settings so we can adjust spawn timers our selves at how often zombies respawn, or maybe have a full day cycle before a cleared POI starts to spawn again.   In many games when the loot is regenerated back in to the POI  Enemies and or zombies are re spawned in also.   There just needs to be more time or more custom settings for the game to really set multiplayer or servers up for a lot of fun. As of now  your fun can be shattered real quick with a bad spawn.

I am only recommending this game because I have faith that the Devs will fix the issues with this game as there is so much promise and potential.  FIX THE SPAWN TIMES PLEASE",1683350854,1683350854,True,1,0,0,2,True,False,True

A controller is also easier when you are gaming on the couch and not at a desk. That aside, the tutorial needs to be play tested by someone who did not work on the game and is going into it with a fresh look. When it tells you to pick up the bandages and use them to stop the bleeding.... it really should tell you how to use the bandages. That's the point of the tutorial. In a lot of game (and especially with a controller), there is a general layout that is commonly used. Example, left trigger to aim and right trigger to fire. How do you use the bandages? No clue. It doesn't tell you how and none of the common keys for using an item worked. The building mechanics could use a little streamlining. A few games have gotten this down, where picking your build item is quick, placing isn't too difficult and then build with a click. Here it felt like the building mechanic was just fitful. To build something in Ark or Conan might take 5 or 6 minutes, took 15 or so on here. 

I know I bashed this game a bit hard, but that's only because I see a lot of potential here and would like to see the developer get it running smoothly. It looks great and has a good feel to it's environment. With some better clarity in the tutorial, a smoothing out of the building mechanic, and, optionally, controller support, I would see this easily rivaling games like Seven Days, Ark, Rust, and Conan. I really hope that the developer keeps at it, but as it is right now; there are too many good games in the genera to spend time here.",1683317390,1683317390,False,2,0,0.529411792755126953,0,True,False,True

The game is lacking optimization right now, the online co-op also is bugged and lags in some cases like driving or rapid movements even if your ping is fine. Also the hitboxes for melee is weird, you can kill your friend even if you don't intend to. And the crosshair ""a dot"" for melees and tools also doesn't sync up, you are hitting lower than the dot.

About the game what it does good and what it lacks:
Like I mentioned, this game is pretty much unturned, with no real objective, you spawn in and build up your base and farm resources, that's it. The game has no real walkthrough nor real story in it at the current stage. 

Looting and crafting is garbage. There is no reason to craft or learn life skills if you can literally loot everything you need, sure there is crafting to be done but my main point is that: you can get EVERYTHING from looting, there is almost 0 point to crafting. The crafting log needs to be increased and the looting needs to be revamped to have less. 

Zombies also don't really feel threatening but if an old man plays it he will have somewhat a challenge, especially with the huge sprinting and suplexing zombie. 

I'm not going to say I dislike this game, but at the current version it's just not worth it because it really is just like Unturned.",1683138668,1683138668,False,1,0,0.494467496871948242,0,True,False,True

The crafting is repetitive and boring, Who wants to stare at a screen for ten minutes doing absolutely nothing? If you don't you don't earn crafting experience. The building is rudimentary and seemingly pointless. There's no need build anything, its far easier to climb up on a building for hoard night. Viral infection kills you in a minute or two.....whats the point? There's nothing you can do about it. Why not just have me die and be done with it. Not to have a bag locator is a big draw back. Saved the game before retrieving pack and lost it....instant rage quit lol. Resourse gathering is very basic and for the requirements  of crafting, inadequate. Admittedly i did not check out the entire map. Frequently your weapon is unequiped and it takes way too long for it to become equiped if you're attacked suddenly.....never mind trying to change weapons during combat....by the time you do you'll be dead. God forbid your weapon breaks. There are many unfinished models and poi. Translation is lacking. There are few if any hints on how to craft anything never mind repair something. I don't mind learning a game, that's half the fun, but i'm not a mind reader lol. If you want to be able to see you hand in front of your face at night you have to turn up brightness which make daytime seem like you're trying to stare at the sun without glasses. Graphics look fine, i've never cared about frame rate or refresh, imho those are stats meant to sell video cards. Its not a bad start and i will try back in a few months. Hope this is helpful

  To be fair after weeks of playing and hundreds of hours I wanted to update. Most of my initial issues were founded on a lack of knowledge. There are plenty of resources and other ways to gain xp, as well as cures for the critical injury. At this point i'm of the opinion what lacks is a bit more direction, perhaps in the tutorial. There's no need to build. Hoard nights are an inconvienece, strength bar is pointless. Its always red lest you waste time sleeping and it doesn't last long enough to matter rendering melee useless. you can't go anywhere or do anything and rely on melee so i just ignore it completely and rely on guns. the inabilty to do anything but run away while being hit sucks. You can't hit back, reload aim or fire. if you get cornered you die. nothing you can do. Vehicle physics are trash. a single zombie can stop a vehicle. a single hit from a zombie can flip a vehicle. their acceleration up a hill is crap. I can play through to the end, having looted all POI once and acheived all tech and buildings in a year and a half of game play. Yes you can erase skills after death but i rarely die and that is not much different than restarting. the game does hold my interest but the map is entirely too small, progression too short and it lacks a purpose. overall it could be good but needs attention in the general arc of play. You must create a need to progress, to build, to farm. Things must be useful and necessary. why craft anything if i can loot it? why build structures that can be destroyed when i can use ones that can't?

No One Survived is a game with a shallow premise, exactly zero explanation on how to progress on the crafting tree, zombies, and the story is precisely 2 sentences long. but also: PHYSICS!
This game plays like a poor midpoint between 7 Days To Die and Rust. It has all of the bad parts from both of those games, with none of the good parts.
It is very pretty as far as graphics and physics are concerned, and it has enough realism in the crafting tree that it makes you need to manage your inventory.

picking up items items from the floor is so difficult that it would be easier to buy the things you want. Tool collisions are so bad that axes quantum teleport through the tree you're chopping. Sound engineering is absent; the devs straight up ripped sounds from other games, so that maybe when you hear them you'll be like ""oh yeah, that is maybe what that's supposed to sound like"". The player character moves so clunky, it may as well be a walrus. But, again, it's visually pretty.

I picked it up on sale. I'll probably uninstall it and come back to it in a year to see if the terrible has been patched out.",1681795682,1681795682,False,44,2,0.686368107795715332,1,True,False,True

Building any elaborate base is a grind unlike any other game.  Harvesting resources does not yield a large return - some resources are finite like trees and rocks.  Driving in the cars is ok but the trucks for whatever reason handling is unpredictable and steering is notchy.  Horde nights are easily thwarted by cheesing existing buildings and as of time of this review there is no building damage for non player built structures.  Horde defense is not as elaborate as say 7 days.  The skill / tech tree was a challenge to finish taking nearly all of my 100 hours of game play to accomplish.

It is the perfect combination of Dayz with 7 Days to Die. My biggest complaint about DayZ was that the base building seemed almost pointless to me because you couldn't set respawn points in game with a sleeping bag, bed, etc. But in this game, it has the option to create a bed and/or sleeping mat to save your respawn point. 

I know it is still a game being developed, but the creators are making constant updates and listen to their community's feedback. It has great looting and building mechanics along with a really impressive and decent sized tech tree which reminds me a lot of Rust's. I also love how much you can customize the settings so far which is not typical of these types of games in early access. It's honestly impressive! You can decide on things like do you want abundant loot or hardly any? Do you want waves of zombies or not? How many sprinter zombies do you want? 

I also have had no issues with performance or running this game. Sometimes the movement and combat can be clunky, but I expect that with a game in early access. You can also easily unstuck your character by selecting ""unstuck character"" in the main menu screen while in game.

I am excited to see all the updates and additions the developers have in store. They have done such a fantastic job so far and i believe this game has true potential to be even bigger and better than 7 Days to Die. 10/10 recommend if you love grinding zombie survival games! It's one of the best out there!

P.S.- Some changes I hope to see are to the driving mechanics and more variety of guns/ weapons.

1) Every time a friend tries to run a private server it stays up for about 10 minutes then kicks me and then the server no longer shows on the server list even though he is still in it.

2) You should not have to close the game to go from multiplayer servers to private servers, the game doesn't even auto restart forcing you to reopen the game.

3) The hit-boxes need to be tweaked, aiming directly at a zombies head close range should not result in either not hitting the zombie or it hits down in the chest. Even swinging a sword or hatchet directly at a zombie sometimes doesn't even hit.

4) Remove the thank you button, its nice to thank those that helped but that's what a credits button is for in the settings option, not on the main screen not to mention its not even capitalized like the rest of the menu options.

5) Fix the doors they are super buggy: i.e if you stand in front of the door and it ""swings"" open and you proceed to walk in you sometimes get that nice jittery jumping bug and have to laydown, unstuck, then you become free to see that the first time you seen the door open it actually opened towards you which is what caused you to become bugged.",1679854217,1680564240,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

 Huge Kudos to the Dev's that are engaged in the forums - t is easy to lose time while playing the game since there are limited moments where you don't have anything to do.  The base building and talent tree is fun and challenging and the overall game experience is well balanced.

The game plays well on a large wide screen at 3840 x 1200 with no issues and I have yet to encounter a bug or glitch while playing the game. 

I am more of a Solo player and No One Survived easily adapts to this through the PVE atmosphere.  You can also play with your friends using the multiplayer environment.

I usually use a formula of 1 hour per 1 dollar.  If I could have gotten 17 hours of play out of this game, I would have given it a better rating.

Optimization needs to be significantly improved, during my play time the game was only utilizing about 2% of my NVIDA 1650 GPU with updated driver, creating a choppy unplayble mess, melee hit boxes appear to be off, most of the models in the game are low quality.

GAME MECHANICS 
- [ ] Books: There’s 5 volumes to each skill. You have to read EACH of the 5 volumes (books) multiple times until each of the 5 separate skill bars are filled. So for each book there’s a skill bar that will fill once you finish the book. Keep in mind your mood goes down when you read. 
- [ ] Every time you get hit by a zombie your virus antibody goes down. If it reaches 0 you die. 
- [ ] STAMINA: Laying down recovers stamina bar %80 faster. Swinging, running, jumping, and steady aiming ALL drain stamina. Doping pills regain part of stamina bar about %40 once it’s been used, so use them AFTER stamina has been reduced. 
- [ ] TRADERS: The max relationship points you can earn are 100 so give them items a little at a time to maximize points 

PROS:
- [ ] After you search something it’s able to be quick searched if happen to accidentally search it twice so it won’t waste time. 
- [ ] ABSOLUTELY LOVE the full/partial mouse keyboard and controller configuration! Full controller support would be awesome too. 
- [ ] Laying down helps your fatigue, health, and (mood if it’s not in 0)
- [ ] If your character gets stuck there’s a “stuck character” option 
- [ ] There’s a way to cancel an action. Like cutting a piece of clothes you might change your mind midway. 
- [ ] Putting ammo in your gun is just simple as having a gun in your hand, bullets in your inventory, and hitting reload. 
- [ ] Holding for steady aiming drains stamina bar so you can actually see how long you can steady aim





CONS: 
- [ ] PVP! WE DONT WANT PVP!!!!!!! THAT’S WHAT DAYZ IS FOR!!!!! I BOUGHT THE GAME BECAUSE I WAS LIED TO ABOUT THEIR BEING NO PVP. BUYERS REGRET 
- [ ] No stealth. No matter how much you sneak zombies MAGICALLY know where you are 
- [ ] Third person aiming is FRUSTRATING! Bullets don’t go where you aim. First person aiming sucks because you have to get more than one headshot for a kill and if a zombie touches you, you stumble way too hard out of first person aiming to be able to gain balance and begin shooting. And while that’s happening, you’re squeezing the trigger and getting no response. Now imagine FPS drops while ALL of that is happening after you’ve ran 10-12 minutes across the map away from camp!!!!!! 
- [ ] Trucks don’t show packages like cart does when items are in it
- [ ] You can’t see through blueprints when building 
- [ ] ZOMBIES JUST WALK UP TO YOUR VEHICLE AND START DAMAGING IT WHEN YOU ARE AWAY FROM IT‼️
- [ ] You have to click to add EACH item with no option to add all. So if you have 50 stones you have to click 50 times to add all items. 
- [ ] Too many pointless structures and warehouse areas that are inaccessible, like GTA, which make them boring and the game bland and lonely. 
- [ ] Model to scale is off like GTA. The character is bigger than doors and most small vehicles 
- [ ] Can’t walk over small things like a falling street light. You have to jump over the pole instead of just walking. 
- [ ] THE HOUSES ARE FENCED IN AND BLOCKED OFF SO THERE IS NO ENTRANCE PATHWAY TO THE FRONT DOOR‼️ NO DOORS OR ENTRYWAYS ON THE FENCE 
- [ ] The rooms are cookie cutter. You’ll find more than one house with the same design 
- [ ] Zombie mele is FRUSTRATING‼️ What’s the point of doing this stupid boxers step in move while swinging EVERY punch!? You have to aim awkwardly to hit them. And 90% of your punches miss because of that stupid boxers step in move!!! You think you have them in the crosshairs of the swing , but miss too often to feel confident about fighting. Because of that stupid boxers step in move that makes you swing beyond the target and waste stamina. The stamina bar depletes WAY too fast for it to be difficult for direct hits. 
- [ ] Accidentally clicking off grid deletes item when organizing inventory 
- [ ] A wolf takes more than one shot to kill it with a high powered weapon 
- [ ] Action behavior information is layered when key remapping options are used. The prompt telling you what to press to pick up something and the information about the item is stacked on top of each other so you can’t read anything. 
- [ ] No unequipped options 
- [ ] No way to mark things or save poi’s on the map!
- [ ] We can’t consume all items from the ground. You have to add some to your inventory. 
- [ ] Refilling empty bottles at the beach caused character to get stuck 
- [ ] I had to take the shoulder light OFF my shoulder and put it in my backpack to charge it (install battery) 
- [ ] Can’t hold items in hand
- [ ] Spawning in around zombies 
- [ ] Spawing in around zombies and being stuck so the zombies KILL YOU AND SCREW ALL YOUR PROGRESS‼️ And the restore pasts loads DOES NOT WORK‼️
- [ ] Zombies can creep up on you but your footsteps sound like elephants 
- [ ] Random times zombies will super jump in the air inside of closed areas making it hard to kill them!
Visual Defects
- [ ] The barter is in the middle of the darn woods with a clean cafe sign with no sidewalks or pathways to make sense why it’s out there!!!
- [ ] FPS SUCKS A
- [ ] Raindrops are seen on puddles inside of barns under roofs where raindrops shouldn’t be seen 
- [ ] Model to scale is off like GTA. The character is bigger than doors and most small vehicles 
- [ ] Electric wires look off on power lines
- [ ] ——————————-
- [ ] I went into a metal structure to get away from the rain and it was COMPLETELY silent. No atmospheric noise. 
- [ ] Crouch walk creeping produces the same amount of sound that walking or running does. 
- [ ] Items on the ground disappearing after saving 
- [ ] An infection causes massive bleeding but you don’t know how you got it no or how to cure it. 
- [ ] ALL doors swing loosely back and forth with no closing or locking mechanism. So zombie’s can just come in a building with a door. 
- [ ] Can’t stack clothes that make sense like tank tops and long sleeves. Or jackets on top of SHIRTS!
- [ ] The camera is too low when running 
- [ ] There’s duplicates of the same picture in houses
- [ ] The game tells you anything left on the ground will disappear after a while. So that means I can’t find a house and horde or stack up materials. 
- [ ] No tutorial that ACTUALLY makes sense or helps 
- [ ] 
- [ ] Bow and arrow headshots feels nice but the arrow disappears. They’re only recoverable on body shots. 
Using items from inventory isn’t NOTHING like you’re used to and it’s NOT intuitive. As of writing this I have YET to be able to drink the water from my backpack so I’m slowly getting thirsty with no aid.

This game is not worth it, even taking into account the now all to common blanket protection of ""early access"" as a shield shoddy developers (and their fans) use to brush away legitimate problems and lack of realistic expectations.Could this game be alright, not great, not amazing, but alright in the future.....

Worth giving a try. Plan on making a few vids myself of it soon to give some folks something more to look at.

The map is fun to get around, there is plenty to do, the enemy AI is well done so far, there is a lot to the crafting systems, weapons systems, and defense systems. I highly recommend this game, because if the devs continue the way they started, this will easily become the top survival/craft game on Steam.**For the Devs, if you read this**Here are a few things that I believe would add to the game, I love what you have done so far and these are just some opinions of mine. But I am just some 32 year old nerd so I would not be hurt or surprised if you ignore this completely haha!1. Gun Crafting - Being able to build more weapons, especially explosive2. More large mobile storage - The cart is ok, but something larger would be nice, especially something that you could tow behind one of the vehicles.3. Being able to use the military vehicles on the map - Adding in this would be phenomenal, also would allow for the addition of a ""diesel"" line in the technology tree.4. Non gas-powered travel options - Something like a bike, or even a handcart for the railroad tracks would be a really fun addition. 5. Electrified metal walls/fence - Building defenses around a larger perimeter wall is daunting, being able to set up some kind of electrified aspect to it would be awesome.6. More Freedom in the technology tree - While some lines of succession make sense, having to get alcohol before gunpowder doesn't make sense. You should add in nitrate and sulfur to obtain and make it in the workbench. 7. The ability to build ""large"" gathered items - Being able to dismantle things like solar panels, generators, crucibles, and inverters on a machining table or a new ""research table"" to obtain a blueprint wold be an incredibly helpful ability. It can be frustrating to obtain the larger items due to their size and weight. 8. The ability to increase strength and carrying-weight/capacity - Adding in a strength gaining aspect to increase carry-weight would be very helpful, and having something within the clothes crafting for added backpack storage, to further increase even the hiking bags capacity. However, if other options are given with mobile storage this is irrelevant.

I know there are other games out there with similar concepts, but I love how everything works.For example, building can seem like a pain, but I actually love the challenge and realism needing structural support through beams adds. And to offset that challenge, you have the ability to design out your base before committing materials to the build.Another thing I absolutely adore is looting. I feel like in a lot of games in the same vein, you can pretty much only loot dead enemies (I'm sure there are others out there that offer more, but I haven't personally seen them.) In this game, there are different areas like houses, a military school, a police station, etc. all with different items that you can loot.I also love all the different skills you can study, the fact that you can grow crops, hunt animals, and build thoughtfully, all with some added challenges that keep things fun, but somehow don't feel too grindy. For example, I just looked at my time playing and it says 18 hours and I was SHOCKED! Where did the time go? I was having so much fun I had no idea how much time I had spent sitting in front of my computer!Overall, I feel like this is the perfect game for a casual gamer looking to get into a little more challenging gameplay, without the hardcore punishment that comes with other survival games (here's looking at you ARK) I'm having a great time, and if you purchase this game, I hope you do too!",1679746816,1679746928,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

A lot of negative reviews are from those who don't give it the old college try. My criticisms of it early on were either patched and updated by the developer, who is very attentive and super cool, or they had to do with the earlier game survival frustrations (car) which we got and use and maintain now. 
I really like this game. One of my top ten all time favorite games now. That is saying a lot. And all I see is true potential as it becomes a ready for prime time title. I would love to see more life in the environment, new enemies, rare items, quest items, and I firmly believe all that will come in time. I research and hunt for games like this one and I have an instance now where the search has truly paid off.


I believe in this game!
I am a big fan of Rust, Valheim, Tarkov, Fallout 76, and always looking for a new game that ticks all the right boxes: base building, looting, shooting, crafting, agriculture, foraging, survival although not if it is overly tedious, good weapons modification and crafting, and of course graphics, atmosphere, etc. This game has it all. Some say it doesn't have PvP but it certainly does. it is friendly fire enabled, so team up with others if you want, or team up with no one. If you allow others on your server, you can assume they are foes. 
For an early access game, this has a LOT more than many full-featured, released games. I am 25 hours in, still skimming the surface. There are some translation issues at the moment, but in a way I find it is endearing. If that is peoples' biggest issue, then get a life. There are nuances here that other games don't have: snow tracks, ambient lighting, many many details you want in a game. And it is on Unreal 5, not pushing the limits of it at the moment, but it is on 5. Other games we have been waiting for are not going to be close to this one at their delayed launches (I am looking at you, The Day Before!) 
If you are waiting for The Day Before, play this. If you like Rust but don't like the toxicity, play this. With a friend or two, this is really really fun. We are just starting to see the possibilities. 
One complaint: Access to a working, repaired vehicle seems so far into the game, we are not close to getting a car yet, so we are in a walking simulator a lot. I with I had at least a bike! The map is huge, and you always start far from the major landmarks. We want to explore farther, but so much is out of reach until we fix up a vehicle. I don't cheat, but I am tempted to spawn a car just for a little balance. 

Other than that, I am enjoying figuring out how the dynamics work, for example how to use the books and traders to increase skills and unlock the skill tree. There is not a lot of Twitchers an how-to videos, which I find refreshing. More to figure out, and rewarding. 
I hope this review is helpful, I don't write many but I want the developers to know how much I appreciate this world in a time of many promises and few deliveries. This game is really solid. I highly recommend it if you read my words and find yourself nodding, get it while it's cheap and support the developers! They have the right idea about what we want.

Performance: Momentary stuttering every now and again, but certainly to a level that can be enjoyable.

Sound Effects: No complaints, ambient bird chirping is good to set the mood.

Game Play: I did not put that much time into this as my review shows, but the world is just empty. You hear birds but there are not any, very few zombies discovered. Along with the lack of objects is there are large stretches where it is not a desert, it is just dirt with visible rocks.

It's very tough going to survive, I've died many times already, but I'm getting better as I go and enjoying the learning experience. The game has DayZ/SCUM vibes to it with zombies, wild boar and wolves to contend with as well as the natural elements. If there's other wild animals I haven't come across them yet.

The game has both single player and multiplayer, giving you the option to join a server or set up a private one. If you don't like PVP you can just go single player. My only slight complaint is that the multiplayer servers are mostly private and locked needing a password to enter with only a couple available to play on, however I've still been able to find games so far. Also people can see each others locations on the map meaning people can find you and possibly target you for loot. I don't think a survival game should give away locations. I haven't been able to find the command for voice or text chat, however it's early access so they'll probably add that function later.

Zombies are very relentless in their pursuit of you once you get their attention. It seems most, if not all buildings, have at least one entrance where you cant close doors meaning if you try to run into a building and shut the doors behind you to block them off while you consider your next move you're pretty much done for. Be very careful not to to get chased by zombies until you have a decent weapon. At least with DayZ and Miscreated you could escape zombies by sheltering in a building by running inside and closing the doors to stop them getting in. Not so much with this game which can be very frustrating sometimes. The stone axe you craft is almost useless against zombies, wait till you have something better before confronting them.

Here is how I think it could improve;

Official servers with default settings that anyone can join instead of just private public servers.

Removing player locations off the map.

Adding voice and text chat.

I could tell you the few cons I have; every time escape is pressed an annoying bleep noise is made, the combat is not as fluid as the video-demonstrations are on Steam, the building is quite lacking. 

I could tell you all day of what the game is short-on, but then I could describe to you what it does right. Firstly; it's complex. This is not a 'grab a piece of wood make a radio tower,' type game. If you want to make a crafting station, or items in a crafting station, you will be farming for materials. If you want to get good gear, you'll be farming, if you want to learn better crafts/trades (vendors) you will be farming. Is this a good thing? I don't see why not; every game has some level of farming, and most are tedious and boring. This game offers great distances in a map, lots of exploration, single and/or co-op/multiplayer experiences and it's fun doing it. 

Some of the pluses I enjoy is not overly complex repairing of vehicles (scum is painful here), driving also doesn't require a skill, the vitals are not overly tricky; you eat and drink, and rest, not difficult. Building is nice, but it lacks a lot, the structure requires stability; finally we see this in a game that actually enforces it. The electrical system is one of the best I've seen, yes even better than ARK's version; because this one makes sense, it's not complex, just requires good materials and batteries. There's a blueprint system for building, and great base defensive system. Blood splashes when you shoot an enemy on impact, and limbs fall off as you fire. I destroyed a wild pig chasing me, it was highly satisfying; and I 1-shot a giant elk for food with an SVD modified. There's modifiable weapons, from suppressors, to extended clips, to arm mods, to handles, to rails, to scopes, etc. Simply repair your weapon with gun-oil and armor with kits. 

For every challenging to obtain item, there's q quick efficient fix. Overall the game is great, especially in EA. I would say 7.5/10; until I figure out how to roll the cars back over that I've flipped, it will remain here. Worth $13.59 as a discount price? Absolutely, even at full price this game is a steal. This will easily be a $35 game upon 1.0 release; or should be. 

Note: I play solo, and I enjoy it, I am sure multiplayer is far more enjoyable.",1679107342,1679257053,True,1,0,0.444444417953491211,0,True,False,True

good: decent base building. not too easy not to grind intensive
           big map
           nice trader system linked with learning skills
            deep skill tree linked with research tree. depending on difficulty it could take you 40+ hrs to lvl a character.
            pvp is good
            weather cycles with seasons 
 
cons:
            AI is dumb. zombies are easily cheesed or stun locked
             lack of high powered creatures. wolf and crawler are only ones to be scared of

I've played quite a bit in the past couple weeks and I have to say this is probably one of the best survival games I have ever played.  I have ~1500 hours in h1z1/Just Survive.  I was so bummed when they shut the servers down.  This scratched that itch and then some.  It has all the small annoyances of early access like small bugs, a few things still need tweaking, a lot of grinding, etc.  But it's early access, we expect that.  It's an amazing early access though.  My husband and I rented a server with some friends, and have really enjoyed exploring, building a base, defending against the waves of zombies, etc.  I'm a fan.  I've told several friends to think about getting it and joining us!  The game needs some optimization and inventory needs a bit of tweaking, but overall I don't really have any major complaints.  The discord server is very active and the dev seems to respond to bugs/QOL things quickly.  There is a suggestion area on there with votes from the community to add or improve aspects of the game.

Its totally playable and enjoyable. We got a private server for our friends and family to play on. The price is great for its current state. 

Now don't get me wrong, the game is far from being finished that's for sure. Animations are funky and weird. Shooting in third person and trying to aim is totally off and wrong. It needs major work done same with the driving the vehicle. Driving in this game is all messed up and skippy. Running also skips and sometimes freezes. Swimming is just god awful that I'm sure the fish are like WTF. 

Ideas for the game:
- Admin for Servers (To allow weather change & Teleporting)
- Server Settings (Allowing us to change some things to our liking.. Example: Faster fatigue gain, Longer DayTime and Shorter Night Time, Weather changes..)
- First Person View
- Better Animations for Person & vehicle
- optimization for Performance
- More Lootable objects & Loot in General
- NO BEAMS for building (For the love of god, get rid of the beams for building. No one likes or loves them. Makes the homes look ugly inside)
- Death Marker
- Auto Run

That's all I can think of for now. I will be updating the list the more I play the game. If you have any ideas to make the game great as well. Please leave a comment below and let your voice be heard. As far as the game goes, I would recommend buying the game before the price goes up the further the game gets done from finishing.

What I can say is that I have played a few survival games, such as Rust, and really enjoy the way everything in this game works.  It handles fairly well, and while third person isn't my favorite, it doesn't take me out of the game like it often does in others.  Running, jumping, climbing, and combat all feel pretty good.  It could use a bit of polish, but for being such an early release, I have zero complaints.

Progression feels a bit grindy without being TOO grindy, such as in Conan Exiles, and not having to worry about upkeep like in Rust is a huge benefit.  Resources seem to be pretty plentiful, though I am playing on casual at the moment.  I'm sure it's more difficult on harder settings, but I wanted to get a handle on how the game works before I start up a coop game on harder difficulty.

I haven't gotten to the point of building a farm or fixing up a car.  Most of my time has been spent killing zombies, collecting salvaged loot from abandoned houses, and building a huge house.  I saw a number of complaints about the building system, but I really don't get the hate.  It's definitely more complex than some games, namely Rust and Conan as those are the two I have the most building experience in, but I like pillars and supports being more than just for aesthetics, so it doesn't bother me.  It's more realistic and warrants nicer construction.  It'd be nice if there were some more options, like triangle pieces, but even big square houses look better than what you'll see in other games, so kudos there.

About the only thing I might change is placeables.  I do prefer being able to drop them wherever they'll fit, as the grid snapping is a bit annoying and ends up forcing wasted space inside a structure.  It's way more efficient when you can squeeze things in pretty tightly, but it's not gamebreaking for me.  I'm perfectly content with grid snapping if it's the only option.  Just a matter of preference and me not liking walking spaces to be cramped.  

All-in-all, I am really enjoying the game.  I'm really looking forward to seeing how it will improve in time.  I skipped the tutorial, so there's probably quite a few things I should go back to go through it for, but even without doing that, everything's been pretty intuitive so far.",1678911334,1678911334,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

I would say there are a few areas that are in need of a little polish but by and large, I've enjoyed my first hours in the game more so than I did when playing other survival games like DayZ, Rust and SCUM. 

If you're looking for PvP then the other games I mentioned might be a better choice but for solo/coop players and those wanting an in-depth yet not overly hardcore survival game, this could be a good purchase for you.

The map is a decent size, there are many locations to explore and many items to scavenge or craft, I would say the game is significantly easier to lean and get into than say DayZ, you should be able to figure out most things without having to resort to guides but at the same time, I believe it offers more on the survival side than say Rust, where the only real threat to your survival is the wildlife (early on when you have no gear) or the other players.",1678772274,1678772274,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

This is Early Access but Devs are exceptionally reactive to players ideas, wants, needs and reports of bugs.  They had not originally planned to support dedicated servers until much later on or near full release but listened to players and very quickly and without too many horrifying bugs released dedicated servers.  The game really has it all, from adjustable difficulty, to number of zombies, and waves at horde night and how many days between hordes, loot respawn etc.  The building is excellent and in keeping with real structural physics and while you can well on vast looting opportunities, you can also live well crafting, farming, raising animals, and production of almost everything that can also be looted.  Recently added mechanical traps, spinning saw blades and line mines have really made horde night a great deal of fun.  Its not difficult to move through the levels of knowledge needed to increase the things that can be crafted and while, at times, the game can seem to be a bit grind - even the grind is fun.  The game has a solo, single play experience, a peer to peer player hosted co-op mode which is pretty robust and with a host on a decent gaming machine you can easily host up to 10 without lag.  The dedicated server has only just released and is said to be able to host 50 and that is true if you dedicated server is a full server and not a rented game on a shared server, in which case your best is about 8-10 but that seems mostly to be a limitation of the game server companies limits on shared resources not the dedicated game software.  There is PVP  but you have the choice of setting that on or off depending is you prefer a total PVE experience or not.  While this is a Early Access game, and is pretty early compared to many EA games out there - is pretty polished and bug free.  And with the responsiveness for the devs bugs get addressed pretty quickly, ones that impact game play usually get addressed within a few days.  They also tend to really listen to players an what they would like to have or really think is needed and implementation of good ones gets done pretty quickly.  So far there is no real game modding but I expect that that will be coming along quickly, at least to start with in the additions of decor and clothing and weapons.

All these games suffer from the same issue...what's end game??  You build camp, grab some gear and loot but then what!!!???....what's next?  What is there to do??
In almost all survival games the game leaves it up to you to come up with your own goals and objectives...in this games case at the 9 hour mark I felt there was nothing left to do.  ..sure I still have things I could build but why? Not much zombie variant, no bosses, loot drops not balanced, places on the map felt empty and lifeless and boring.

Has XP/Experience/Level system, character customization (still kind of basic at the moment), building system, hunger/medical system, vehicles, etc.  It still needs tweaking for sure, but all in all, I think it is better than some ""done"" games already.

I have not played anything other than solo and usually do not, so all I said is based on that.  I see a little graphics lag on turning some times.  Some things like the loom and one oven sometimes glitch to where I seem to be interacting but not actually doing anything and I break off it says it is in use until I save/reload it.

So if you end up spending hours grinding a skill up to 5 and things get a bit to easy you cant jack up the difficulty. I've died once and it was from a traps a friend placed. Vehicles are a bit buggy inputs feel a little delayed otherwise they wake things much easier. The ADS mode on firearms can be a little buggy when first entering it. Iron sights on most Russian weapons suck but generally are better. When hosting a non dedicated server you'll experience frame drops with nothing to explain it, for example my GPU 30% my CPU 30%-35% ram 12-17gbs out of 64 gbs  frames 8-16. i have yet to find a reliable fix it will happen in single player as well way less frequently and a quick pause-unpause will fix it. Now that i've told you how terrible the game is lets get to why ive put 25 hours on it in the last 3-4 days. The Grind for skills is nice if you don't enjoy overly grindy games. guns feel good to use similar to other 3rd person games you cannot aim if to close to a wall it needs a little tuning but it also prevents firearms from being a get out of jail free card in CQC making you use things like the combat punch in CQC or create distance by turning and burning. vehicles piss off/ scare off everything within a radius of the car. Power functions are cool but need upgrading different Ah batteries and different watt solar panels many ways to make energy from thermal gas and solar allowing you to add power when need be. horde nights are not game ending but if you aren't prepared you will get steamrolled quick overall this game feels like 7 days to die and dayz had a kid with a bit of state of decays looting system. the game is constancy getting updates and the despite not being from america tries to make update logs in English and for the most part they are solid.

The discord and twitch community for the game is very strong. The Dev is very active with the community and the road map looks awesome. He just added PVP and a new territory table. People are hosting dedicated servers. The potential is there. For the price it's an extremely good value. I'm currently at around 65hrs and I plan to invest many more hours into exploring the huge map and unlocking the entire tech tree.

Performance is decent with the expected occasional frame dips. I run it on a 2080ti and it runs fine on default settings. If you play around a bit with the settings you can really dial it in. The graphics are beautiful. It's all built in UnrealEngine5 so it's heavy but it's also a good example of what's possible in the new engine. Global illumination, DLSS etc..

The game plays like a true survivor game in that something is always trying to kill you whether it's a zambo, wild animal, your stomach, weather or a tree landing on your head. You have to learn skills and craft and maintain your vitals and stamina. Everything hurts. It's tough out there.

In the initial game setup you can choose 6 random character attributes and configure your game to the difficulty you desire. You can make it easy and just enjoy looting and building or (my recommendation) crank it up a bit and enjoy larger more frequent hordes and the challenge of looting while zambos hunt you down and agro you. There is of course a PermaDeath option for the hardcore survivors.

The game still needs a lot of work but it is in a very playable state and is fun. It 's cool to see how stoked everyone is in discord and how quickly the Dev is turning around patches and feedback.

IMHO, this game low key TOPS that. Yeah, sure there's bugs here and there, but every game has bugs.

lets get the simple stuff out of the way first, does it have controller support, no none at all. does steam controller overlay work, yes it does very well. the game is built for 3rd person play with i personally like alot but if you prefer 1st person to my understanding its limited to just using a gun to look down the iron sights. 

the game has all of trademark things, simple character creator, looting, crafting, large enough map, can enable daily zombie hords, and like all zombie survival game it is a bit clunky. but the game works very well and if you enjoy survival games i think youll like this one alot. 

in terms of the game extra systems, you do need to eat, drink, sleep, keep yourself happy, and manage 2 simply bmi related food intake numbers. i personally think adding to much of these types of things take away from the actual game and end up making you sit in the menus more then the world itself. but this game isnt super bad. not nearly as bad as Scum. 

so alot of the problems i have with this game are likely just the fact that its early in the game development and needs a bit of time to bake a bit more. they are small things that im sure will be fixed, giving that the game doesnt die and the devs dont abandon it. things like, i think items should have a little higher of a stacking number, if you have 5 bandages, each one individually take up a 2 by 3 block in your inventory and only heal for 1 health. or if i want to cut a rag in my inventory i have to currently be holding a knife in my hand, they game doesnt understand there is one in my quick belt. these things are not game breaking by any means but just make the game needlessly tedious when it doesnt need to be. 

over all  i do enjoy the game and i plan on playing it much more. at the time of writing this i have about 4 hours of gameplay

Baring in mind that its an early access game, I can see that it has loads of potential. The game play is good at first, and once they've ironed out a few glitches, will be even better. However, there is still a lot of work to do. Even changing the loot levels to low, I found that it took only a matter of days of exploring to be armed to the teeth with rifles and pistols so that no zombie really stood a chance. This needs to be balanced with lesser early stage weapons (a stone axe and wooden bow take ages to kill zombies but not quite as long as 7 Days to Die in early stages) and a far lesser chance of finding an M16 by day two. 

The building mechanics again have a lot of potential, but due to finding loot so easy, makes most of the pretty huge grind to level up your skills, kinda unnecessary as you're better off just searching for more ammo then bothering to make much except perhaps a bigger house. At the moment, it needs way more building options and the roof tiles need to be better optimised as they don't fit well even on regular square shaped homes. 

It would be great if you could capture some of the buildings in the villages and make them your own, but currently you can't even leave a sleeping mat in a room which is nonsensical. 

The final part is that the map is actually really small and the same every time, so once i'd explored it with one character, I knew exactly where to go for everything with my second character, which made the exploration aspect rather boring. 

I'll still say it has a lot of potential, but a lot of work still needs to be done to give this game longevity. I'd probably wait another 6 months before purchasing this in the hope that they'll bring out loads more content and make the game more challenging.

the game also has a very different unlock system for benches and items that i think is a great concept and works well again for a realism aspect add that the skill leveling is very well done and i think again from a realism stand point makes since 

I do with that we had double doors and also corner pieces for building so the builds didn't look so boxie and also the animal husbandry is a little not worth what you get out of it however the game overall is worth the 18 dollars i spent

Aside from the low frames, and regarding the gameplay, it's an incredibly low effort asset flip feels like the early stages of blocking a game out. (Also, using the Low preset turns the game into a mobile game.. so nope I'm out.)

The game feels like it's trying to be a modern 7 Days to Die, but somehow fails so horribly that even though its graphics are from Unreal Engine 5, it makes me want to play 7DTD instead.

Not sure what the positive reviews are on about but this was a pretty disappointing purchase, and honestly, I don't have high hopes for the future.

My 2 cents on this game. Just know that if you're looking for a zombie survivalcraft game, you're better off looking at 7DTD.

Verdict: Looking better than most games in the same genre. The environment gives me H1Z1 vibes with far better graphics engine. While the game isn't entirely perfect, the potential is so high for this game to become a fantastic 7 Days to Die and DayZ alternative.

Things to improve:
• Better Textures
• Better implementation of building snapping
• Nerf the building requirements or at least give server admins to manage resource requirements

I've had less fun and spent less time on games that were farther along in development and cost twice as much.  Are there things to improve on?  Of course, it's early in development.  Look at how long 7 Days To Die spent in development to get to where it's at.  The worst design mechanic I've run into so far is the crafting XP (staring at benches to level up) which can be extra annoying in multiplayer and deciding who has to focus on skills.  Do you want to go scavenge?  Sorry, gotta stare at the benches.

I've played many of these type of games and often they crash frequently, have you killed due to stupid bugs or quickly make you want to quit playing the game.

However, not with this one. Yes there are some issues such as FPS drops in areas with buildings (3080 GPU) that can be a little annoying or when you're zooming with the car across the map but it doesn't particularly hinder your gameplay. Some game design is poor but not game breaking. Yes there are functionalities missing but not required to make as much hours as I have.

I love the new experience that this game offers on finding out locations of certain loot or pushing you to be innovative with inventory management. A good balance between early-mid-late gameplay and if you like building and scavenging you will even love the late game by creating cool builds and make base designs to fight off hordes. Most fun is definitely the early stages, least amount of fun is the mid stage (still fun though) and late game is for people who can be creative and enjoy scavenging.

Now since I am done praising the game, onto the bad. Sounds is amazing volume is not. It is entirely too loud especially the first cat screen when logging into the game. The overall sounds need to be cut in half. Next would be the skill learning system. There are two ways of learning skills, sitting there staring at a workstation where you make the item or a book where you lose mood each read. My biggest complaint is this system. It needs to be overhauled in my opinion. Other then those two things I would say adding more areas (Which I will always want) and adding more end game content, boss zombies, majorly hard bases, something like valheim where you can summon a boss would be neat.

I'd rather tell the devs myself instead of complaining about it which does nothing for development. ""No One Survived"" right now is just another ""Dead Matter"" a not so polished, Completed or even really playable at this point. Another game that shouldn't either be in this early of access rather then taking their time to do closed Alpha and beta testing with the steam community would of been a much better approach then to release a game with way too many features and information missing from the game. Lots of bugs that could of been fixed again ""Closed Alpha's & Beta testing"". Right now at this time I will give the game a 1/10 because of how lazy the game makes the devs look in terms of not using closed testing for their game. Also because they went right to Unreal engine 5 when they could of still made their game look beautiful with Unreal engine 4.x.x. Take Squad as a great example they haven't even touched UE5 for Squad at all just a graphics update to the game about a year ago and it's still able to run on UE4.x.x. I feel the game could use a lot of changes in terms of the Crafting system witch doesn't show you how many items you have IE: Stone arrows you need stones and branches. This could be added to the game so simply with a few lines of code but that's yet to be seen. 

My review stands as it is and I will not change till I see some HUGE or BIG progress.

While the game has potential, it is currently lacking in overall polish and requires further development to become truly enjoyable.

One of the biggest issues with No One Survived is its lack of support for controllers. While some players may prefer keyboard and mouse controls, many others find that controllers offer a more natural and intuitive gaming experience. 

Despite this setback, there are some positive aspects to the game. The graphics are well-done, creating an immersive environment that draws players in. Additionally, the gameplay mechanics are interesting and engaging, with a focus on survival in a harsh and unforgiving world.

Overall, No One Survived has the potential to be a great game with some additional development and support.

Weather is nice, gameplay loop is fine (to an extent, touch on this later), the survival aspect is serviceable, the shooting and combat are functional, character customization is nothing special, but a welcome addition, and looting is genuinely enjoyable. 

The bad? Outside of the weather being nice, the sound design needs work. I have a tendency to focus on sound in games because sound is integral to atmosphere and creating immersion. I don't like being able to notice the looping in certain environmental effects like birds chirping--or worse, hearing the sound file for a gust of wind just stop in the middle of playing. It really bogs down the experience. 

The game play loop, while functional, doesn't really play out well in several aspects. The same aspects I praised also have their own issues that deter this title from really shining. Water bottles deteriorate at a ridiculous rate. I'm fine with bottles deteriorating with use but not after two uses. Why? Also, I contracted malaria even after boiling the water I collected. Malaria cuts your stamina bar in half--the map is huge, I'm out scavenging for supplies, a significant distance from home, I drink my supposedly safe water, get malaria, stamina bar goes bye-bye. I have a long, boring, frustrating walk ahead of me that included getting attacked by a wolf and nearly dying from that wolf due to my debuffed stamina. 

Which leads me to the combat. Stamina at max or bamboozled by malaria, you're going to put a lot of it to waste with the clunky melee. The attacks simply don't hit most of the time. I managed to put together a little trick i use to up my chances of hitting a zombie in the head (which is stepping toward them and then back, attacking on the backstep, giving you a chance to avoid their attack if you miss yours because of the busted mechanic) but that got annoying fairly quickly. Melee is a chore. Guns are better. The shooting feels flimsy but it doesn't feel broken. Gun sounds need work as they're not the best and don't really pack any punch. At least I can say the hit register isn't broken for the guns. 

I'm just going to mention base building briefly. It's long, drawn out, and generic, punctuated by the mind numbing grind you'll endure to build a simple 2x2 hut. If logs stacked in the inventory it wouldn't be so bad. But they don't--and it's bad

Finally the looting is a lot of fun but NOTHING stacks in your bag. Everything is separated which naturally results in your bags being full and you needing to depot. This also really doesn't help when you're gathering mats for building your base. This game has set out to be something good and possibly unique among all the other survival games out there but every feature it offers is in some way affected by some kind of bug, design oversight, or technical issue that ruins the experience.

Food, water sustenance bars, inventory grids, outfitting and basic base building. Most of what you will find here are basic survival trope mechanics you can easily find anywhere else. Character movement and flow is pretty decent. Aside from melee locking you into a casting animation, running around and jumping over stuff works for the most part.

Visuals are okay. It uses Unreal 5 which comes prepackaged with decent lighting and post processing. Most if not all of the structures are UE store market assets which you will recognize from other games, which isn't bad per se, but the level design here is often lacking, with almost everything slapped on a flat plane without far off visual markers like mountain ranges or landmark towers. Again, it looks pretty with UE5 lumen and an okay amount of assets used, but the placement is quite... Stale.

But what makes a zombie game stand out from the pack? I think this is something this title still needs to find out. There is a zombie night siege system similar to 7 Days or Night of the Dead, but this idea is no longer novel. If you take away all the standard survival game tropes,  there is nothing. The zombies only come in two varieties, either your normal shambler or a crawler that is just a tougher zombie. 

What this game ultimately needs is some higher overarching draw to it that other zombie games don't have.

1. Mini Map. Please, for all things great and holy, add a mini map. Hitting M every 5 seconds to see if you are walking in the same direction is taxing on ya digits. 
2. Stones were set to stacks of 5. Can we please get the same for logs?? 
3. Have the ability to alter in game settings instead of having to back out and start a whole new save file just to implement mob waves. Not everyone is ready to jump right in to having zombie rushing them from the start. Give the option, at the very least, to toggle this feature on and off as host chooses. 
4. Biggest issue yet, If we create a character, then that characters knowledge and stats should transfer. It is our character. Having to start over every time you enter a new game load is sooooo taxing and will eventually spell doom for new players wanting to join a multiplayer match after they have gotten the feel of solo, only to discover you have to start from 0.

I would imagine the dev team will make it possible to access them while inside the inventory screen of the box/cart/car in the future.

I was fully stocked with ammo, guns, food, supplies, and with full health bars, etc and game crashed. I was left with nothing and had to start over.  5.

CONS-
1. the game looks like it was made in blendr, the tree pop ins and building props are just laughable

2. houses just float there, only a wall or a floor will spawn in a entire city and you will have to guess where or what your doing and there is no fixing that!

3. the game is so boring and feels lazy being put together, everything will break the game or your inventory will just vanish no reason what so ever

4. you will die for no reason, theres a great idea where infection can kill you instantly, no notice, no announcements just death and you will loose everything. oh you will just go back to your body? i hope you made a mental note of exactly where you died or its gone forever. no markers, and nothing to tell you why you died.

5. the fact they have the balls to charge anyhting more then 1.99$ for this game is crazy,... mobile games have more attention and detail. 

6. you wanted to shoot? that sucks guns are the worst thing to use. this game has not had any changed to fixes to the shooting so all the recent updates just break it even more and more. trying to just swing a knife? that really sucks! the glitchy mess that is the AI in this game will hit you about 6 times before you land a hit on them and just 1 hit will be fatal if not instantly killing you!

7. i get it early access means not finished but god, if this game means early access then id truly like to give up on gaming. its a running simulator with nothing inside of it but fake reviews and people that will try the game anyways to see if its really this bad.   ITS TERRIBLE!

The camera feels ""Floaty"" I don't know how else to describe it. It's just uncomfortable, But certainly not game breaking.
Crafting is Tedious. Mainly due to the inventory system. I took me around 30-45 minutes just to get a simple base set up.
It went something like this - Chop tree - Craft Hammer - Layout Foundation - Chop Tree - Add Materials to foundation - Chop Tree - Add Materials to fondation - Repeat until all 4 Foundation tiles have been built 
Layout Walls and Door way
 - Now I need wood planks, How to i get wood planks. Searching the Crafting menus - No wood planks. Search other menu's - Oh, I need to build a Processing Table. - Chop Tree - Add Materials.
Finally got the Processing table built. Now I need to... You guessed it, Chop a tree to get logs to add to the crafting table to craft them into Planks.
Done. Added Walls, Door, and a Roof.

Save game and Exit.

Combat is Okay'ish. Not great, Not Horrible. My limited exploration of the map was enjoyable, looks good and lots to explore.
I understand that the game is going for a more ""Realistic"" approach to the survival genre, But sometimes to okay to simplify things. I can deal with managing Hunger, Thirst, Hygiene, and all the other little subsystems. But the inventory system is ****ing boring. Yeah, I know In real life I wont be able to carry 8 tree's worth of logs around. But I really don't feel like spending my time running from tree to Crafting station for 30 minutes just to process the items to be able to build something.
It's not a bad system, it's just tedious as hell. Hopefully it gets better after I craft the Cart to pull around and haul more stuff. But that doesn't fix the fact that I'm still spending more time running back and forth gathering, Dropping off materials to process into more materials, to finally be able to do what I want.

The inventory system is a huge turn off for me personally. Using a Grid and Weight system is all fine and dandy... But If I can carry 300 lbs of gear, but 8 logs take up the whole grid and only weigh 120...Then whats the point. Make them stackable. And let us top off our inventory. (Those aren't actually in game numbers - just using it as an example)
I understand the desire for ""Realism"" but it's being dont at the expense of FUN. The crafting looks enjoyable. The inventory is bland and boring.

All things considered though, for under $20 its hard to say it's a bad game. And again, My time spent playing this is VERY limited so far. And I'll probably continue to put some time into it here and there. 
For the price, they've got a lot of good things in place.
Would I recommend... Meh. If you've got an extra $20 and want something new, I suppose.

Keep it on your Wish list and wait for more development. I'm going to uninstall and check back in 6 months, but honestly it feels like it needs 12 months at least to be playable.

edit: I gave it another try. I just can't do it. Incredibly un-optimized its unreal. I have a i9 10850k and a 3080 too. Melee is horrible you miss everything your curser is on. Every zombie you kill has their head pop straight up and off, same every single time.  You start in the middle of no where and its snowing right away.

Really...? I decided to leave my safe hole I spent 3 years living in... in my underwear?  The only thing I like is that when you loot stuff you can tell there are a ton of items in the game, that and shooting the bow feels good.

To be honest, it is an Ok-ish game ... not looking or feeling too good. Optics - its just some assets placed around, not much in terms of places that feel real. The ""minigame"" of moving stuff around in the backpack so I can fit in just a little more ... I get it, encumberance is weight and the unhandyness of stuff, but it is not much fun. A lot of stuff is good - like the camp fire to cook stuff, 2 pieces on stones and 3 more if you have a pot. Cooking water before drinking, good. Making a bed of leaves and branches to sleep and set the spawnpoint, that is pretty much standard. Nutrition divided into water, proteins and carbonhydrates - nice. Hygiene - as in washing yourself - is needed to not get infections. Felling trees gives you logs and branches - ok. There is a tech tree, but I could not figure out what I have to do to advance. ""Night of the Dead"" has you collecting reseach points. I expected something similar, but no. Maybe I overlooked it. Then there is the usual ""workbench-x-crafts-y"" stuff. Running will use up your stamina and then you get exhausted. Ah yes ... the Zombies are only infected people, but there is not much difference. You can have waves attacking you. Seems you can collect car stuff - oil, fuel, parts of various kinds - but I have yet to find a car that can actually be repaired. I am not qute shure where the hype around this game comes from. If you want to play good *unfinished* survival games, there are ""Surroundead"" (low poly optics, not everyone likes that), ""Night of the dead"", ""Mist: Survival"".

The devs are very attention-detailed, you can tell this by some gameplay elements such as lock-picking as well as a fantastic player tutorial scene!

It's, actually, a pretty relaxing game. Think; open world crafting with zombies sprinkled in.
We've been enjoying it and I could see about a total of 60 hours of game play (we're currently at ~30 hours)
Explore, build with friends, stay alive - if you die - no big deal, set your spawn point with a bed roll.

We enjoy the fact that it's not a really stressful (with initial game settings).
Go into towns with enough arrows and you'll get the items you need... check repawn rates, you might need to setup
small camps all over - keep moving... build water points... collect reading material.
I don't think we would like the game if it was super difficult.

Dedicated servers coming soon - hopefully, I can run one on Linux. :-)

One thing is for sure - it's a billion times better than DayZ was at launch - hopefully, the devs will
add another map - or make this one even bigger. That would be nice.

For that alone, this game gets a high rating for me. 

I really, really enjoy it. I am autistic with OCD and ADHD and this game kept me captivated for three days straight without any breaks, something I'm not bragging about, but it was great. I will try to do bullet points for pros and cons and not get side tracked. Keep in mind, most of the cons are just EA issues that are being worked on and the devs, again, are listening to feedback on.

Pros
1. Building mechanics: My team are loving the building aspect and how free it is. There IS a learning curve (base first, support beams second, overhead beams third, walls fourth, ceiling last) that makes it frustrating, especially if you build a large building without the correct steps and find out nothing will sit together, but it wasn't too hard to learn. The community is also actively adding tutorials and whatnot to the wiki page and the devs respond to them frequently. I find it to be similar to the Fallout 4 building mechanics with extra steps.
2. Cooking mechanics: It is neat finding out what recipes you can make with different foods and I do like that foods expire so you do have to work on coordinating what you are harvesting and searching for with what you're eating and how quickly you will eat it.
3: Visuals: They are not super in depth and insanely high detail but they are neat to look at. There was a lot of care taken by the devs in placement and design so it gives a very natural feel. Again, it isn't the absolute best in the world, but I'm very happy with it for an EA game released a month ago. 
4. Weather/atmosphere: When it rains, it RAINS. It's really pretty rain and the puddles and water on items is really neat. Snow builds up over time and you make tracks in it. I love the weather mechanics in Red Dead Redemption 2 and this feels almost comparable. 
5. General gameplay: As stated, I couldn't put the controller down. You never run out of things to do. Base complete with everything in it? Go build another one! There are no quests or anything right now, but it is a very easy game to play with friends and create your own story lines. There are dev tools as well that allow you to develop the world how YOU want to, which I love.

Cons:
1. Melee mechanics: There are VERY clunky and you miss a lot. The wiki page is giving tips on how to do better and work with the current state but it does need work badly.
2. Vehicle damage: Vehicles are present but insanely destructible. Four hits from a zombie immediately breaks it down. It takes two car repair kits to repair, which you have to craft because it is very difficult to find them (loot spawns randomly).
3. Zombie spawning rate: In more detail below for actual behaviors, but even at 6% spawning rate, zombies are constantly spawning behind us, in front of us, beside us--all over the place in areas we just cleared out, which is really, really annoying. They also respawn directly inside of camps and bases. We chose a base that we hadn't seen ANY zombies in and after getting up walls and traps, suddenly we had 10 zombies every day spawning directly inside of our camp. This is a problem as they go after your livestock AND damage your working vehicles.
4. Zombie behaviors: I'm NOT a fan of this aspect. With this being centered around SURVIVAL after the apocalypse and NOT centered on zombie survival (like Dying Light, Days Gone, Left 4 Dead, Dead Island, etc), I'm a little bummed over HOW aggressive ALL of the zombies are. There are special infected that you have to watch out for, that's fine, but even the regular zombies are more akin to 28 Days Later infected versus The Walking Dead. There are options to lower spawn rate for zombies and how many spawn at once, but the lowest it goes is 6% which is still spawning 10-30 extremely aggressive, fast zombies everywhere I go. I got this looking more at the survival aspect of it, which it is centered on, and don't really enjoy the insane track star zombies. I play zombie centered games for that need. 

5. There is currently a big issue with a Fatal Error message that the devs are looking into; this is causing the game to be completely unplayable for a lot of people. regardless of computer specs. I would check discussions and updates for the game before purchasing as some people cannot get the game to open, period, without this being fixed. 

I am really excited to see where this goes. Even the cons are not huge. Keep in mind, this game has a HUGE variety of customization tools so there is a style for everyone.",1676176755,1676176755,True,16,1,0.671733498573303223,0,True,False,True

Does the game have some bugs, yes it does. Though out of all of the Open World Survival type games (and I have nearly every one that's worth mentioning) this is probably the most ""ready to play"" release I've seen, period. I remember playing ARK way back when it first released and could barely get it to run or work after each update, same with Green Hell, 7DTD and the list goes on.

Some of the complaints I do agree with, vehicles need work, zombies themselves could use some more variety, progression tasks or some scenarios  that force exploration would be nice, and PvP really isn't something worth while at this stage. 

IMO the good far out-ways the bad so far, I haven't had any big lag or game braking issues (though my PC is decent so not sure how a low end one would do). Multiplayer mode isn't terrible. The building is already better than 90% of the fully released games out there and I welcome the UE5 updated graphics even though it does cause some issue atm.

Bottom line I do recommend the game overall and if the devs keep up the pace it'll probably crack my top 3.

There are lots of options on how hard the game play is.  Survival aspects are solid (food, water, mood, etc).  Melee and shooter action needs some fine tuning (lot of bugs yet with targeting).  But the ground work is there for making some good weapons and having unique play styles. Base building is fun and tech tree is a challenge to work through.
The vehicles have great potential but still have few bugs to work out.   They are way too fragile.  Hitting a wolf will flip your car and send you flying.  No worries though, that wolf still full of life ready to chomp you down.  (ha ha) I suspect this will be tweaked as game development goes on.

Surprising how people miss this giant message before leaving a shit review.

Yes,  this game is a little rough around the edges in some aspects - and the view during combat at times can feel a little clunky,  but once you figure out how things work - it's not so bad.  Overall this game has a lot of cool mechanics and a lot of things to do for an early access game.  It has the visuals of DayZ, along with similar inventory system and health, thirst, carbs, protein etc to worry about.  It has a similar progression skill/unlock system as Project Zomboid, so you can't just race to the end game within an hour, you actually have to put in a little bit of work and go out and search for things.  It has zombie waves/hoards similar to 7days in where they will attack your base every X amount of days if you enable that setting, and it has the building mechanics of Valheim where you need to worry about where you put Pillars and Columns and stuff while you're building and worry about structural integrity.  If you blow out a wall with a hand grenade or the zombies destroy it during hoard night, half your house could fall down... so defend it, or make a separate hoard base.     

There's smelting, tailoring, cooking, farming, animal breeding, electricity, and some other things you can do,  Zombies around POI's and  wolves, boars, deer, bears, rabbits in the wilderness.  

There's a lot of reviews about the game being poorly translated - and a week ago that may have been true, but I volunteered my help to the developer to translate the game to English, and will keep on top of that for the foreseeable future.. because it's a game i actually like, and want to keep playing.   It's definitely worth the price point that it's at, at its current development state. 

It doesn't have dedicated servers -  but that's on the roadmap.
It doesn't have ways to lock your base - but that's also on the roadmap alongside dedicated servers. So don't go making a public server and expecting to not be griefed,  because that's just the kind of world we live in.... use your brain, really.    Only invite your friends till dedicated servers come out.  It's not a hard idea to grasp.  

There's a lot of stuff that's planned for the game as far as i can see by talking to the developer + checking out the released road map.. including fishing!   I'm honestly excited about where this game could go.   The developer spent 2 years making the game we're currently playing, so looking at just that, it's pretty great to see - considering it took 7daystoDie 8 years to just rework the progression system and add a gun?  Don't get me wrong, 7daystoDie is an amazing game, but It's taken them way too long to go nowhere - and 'No One Survived' pretty much already has everything 7 days has within 2 years of development,  except that its not a voxel game and you can't dig underground.

Melee doesn't work you end up spending the whole energy bar swinging at air because of the stupid combo swing that has to fully play out before you can swing again and can't be canceled, the vehicle driving is horrid you need to keep a full supply of repair kits on you because you ARE going to hit every rock and tree near the road (not to mention the indestructible railroad crossing arms that pop in right as you get to them and dead stop you or flip your car into the air taking half the vehicles health bar) because the handling seems to be set on steering wheel mode, don't try to hit zombies with the car it will come to a dead stop here too and they will swarm you and destroy it because the car seems to draw every zombie for 10 miles, there's no marker to show where your body is either on the hud or map (infact there is no marker system at all in game which means they actually turned it off as it was on by default) so you will have to end up using beds to mark places and just remember whats there, half your time is going to be spent staring at menu's because you can't get points for stuff with the window closed or crafting from your backpack, and to top it off the desync is so bad that if you loot too fast it locks out containers so you can't open them again without a relog (where you have to re loot everything because the game keeps the inventory of a container but not the looting state) and I've almost been killed by a stuff not rendering on my screen but suddenly ""popping in"" and knocking me across the base. This game looks great, the weather effects are amazing but unfortunately I think that's only because of this being an UE5 game which is the reason it looks so much better than mot games out there but it plays like an asset flip because nothing has been configured. I know this game just came out and its an early access title but there are 2010 asset flips that run better than this and I would rather play something ugly like H1Z1 that actually worked over something like this that kills me every time I log in because all the zombies respawned inside my base every time I relog...

The game has been updated a few times and I've had much better performance. Still has lag spikes as you traverse the map, especially if you're in a vehicle because you're going so fast. But honestly it's WAY better and much less frustrating. I've been enjoying this one a lot.

*EDIT*
There has been an update since I posted my original review below and the performance seems to have gotten worse. No matter what I do, it frequently drops down to 20fps then after messing with settings, I can maybe get it to 40fps. Either way, it makes it unplayable. I wanted to keep trying, but this is so frustrating and difficult to play with. If they can update to fix the performance issues, that'd be great.

I'm running on an RTX 2070, Ryzen 5 5600X and 32GB RAM, FYI.

----------Original Review----------

I'm a little over 2 hours in running single player and it's not bad. There are some random performance issues like big frame rate spikes and drops down to 20fps for seemingly no reason. Adjusting settings seems to fix it and bring it back up to 60fps and then when I revert back to the previous settings, the framerate stays at 60fps, so I'm not sure what the deal is.

The map is huge and I'm enjoying it so far. The game was made in another language (Chinese, maybe?) and not translated very well at times. There is still a lot of text that wasn't translated at all, so it's a bit of a guessing game when it comes to the messages that pop up at times.

Other than that, it's worth a shot. $15 on sale isn't a bad deal.

I mean its a Zombie Survival Game like there a trillions out there that are lightyears better than this one. Starting from Graphics via Performance lags and up to Creativity etc.

Pros: Multiplayer up to 10 (havent tried 10) but 3 works ok. The starter has quite a good performance FPS ok but the joiners have rubberbands - dont know of other experience that same.
Multiplayer is a MUST to my own Op., nearly all the others struggle to even make it available why it will always lie in the dark for me.
Looting is really nice - just fun and the essential center of a game like this

Cons: sorry there are far to many - here they come
- Map is the same as in other survival games - sadly I already knew it
- Skilling system is ridiculous! Why the heck do you have to skill the white out of your own eyes to be able to meet the requirments to build a crafting Table? Thats just a no no
- This 'Book system has to be overworked - you dont know if you got a point or skilled progress you can read the books over and over and over why? The Long Dark has a better solution for that.....
- also... the whole protein, carbs, mood, cleanliness, aaaaaaaaand so on - is far too much - I mean nice to watch - but Life does not work that way - Just considering at least you got to do something but around 10 points of interest to stay healthy is just far to much.... Just my Op.
- Cars: All the available cars are trash unless you walk over the whole map to get this car repair kit. The Fact that it appears random at the trader is a Nuisance. First time i walked there no kit. WHY is that so complicated? Do you want the ppl to have fun on a game then dont make it so DANG hard. Games are for fun and amusement - my evenings are spent with the games  available on steam. And yours is one of them. Dont annoy the ppl - make some cars available at once and others broke down but repairable. Even if one or the other car is only half ready to be taken. 
btw: This repair kit for the cars is ok but if you drive over a stone you already lose 5 points in car health - honestly? REally? Thats just crap. You run over half the map - grab a kit for 50 health and lose 5 health due to a stone? OK - a car that breaks so quick wouldnt even be bought lol.

Exactly right now that this early stage of the game you want them players to stay tuned no?

- Buildingsystem: .....Why can you not craft boards right after the beginning? Same as the crafting Table?  You need them for Walls - what is the use of offering them in the easiest material and being able to craft them?That does not make sense at all. As an alternative you should offer some kind of material that you can use instead of the boards like plantfibre or cloth or something primitive pine tree branches..

These Feral Zombies are faaaaar to hard to cope. There is no from easy to hard in stages - its easy a bit harder and insame - the step from easy zombie to Feral is too huge. Just my 2 cents! You are simply not prepared for that stupid creep.

A lot of critisism I know that but as a player with over 9200 hours on dayZ I do think i know what i am talking about. Apart from that i have tons of hours on ARK, Conan The Forest and a lot of other survival games. Sorry for being so harsh.

All in All this game is promising i like the map to - allthough its from a building kit system. But after all i am still playing here - i played and tested tons of other games and stopped very quickly  and there were dozens.

The searching for items feels like scum, but scums gunplay is a lot better than this. Which just made me want to play scum instead.

Performance is all over the place, one minute it's capped at 60fps the next it's sitting in the 20s with no real change to what I'm doing in the game. It rips you out of the experience.

GRAPHICS 

I would recommend the developer turns down the puddles from the rain, because it basically turns the ground to a giant lake.
The graphics look good, the storms are nice to experience and add to the atmosphere. Some pop in on small rocks is noticeable, but that can be easily fixed.

If they add first person and make the gunplay more engaging while reducing jank, no one survived could be a good survival game, but with the gameplay currently I'm just not motivated to play this gameplay loop.

Refunded the game and will give it a year or two in the oven.

When playing zombie games I look for just a few elements to keep my interest and replay-ability.

Firstly is smoothness and realism of Zombie dispatching... an I have to say, this game is great for taking on hordes of chompers with a shotty and a prayer, or lighting up the night sky with the repeated muzzle flashes of your trusty Scar-H. You still have to think what weapon to use though, as the aforementioned are no good in close quaters and can easily get you overrun fast! when they get close, pull out your MP7-A1 with triangle grip fore handle and extended mag to mow your foe to the after-afterlife, or swing your beautiful hand crafted steel machete through the softened flesh of the undead as they attempt to get to know you on the inside. Decapitation is real, dismemberment is fun... but most of all, the gore pools left behind are outstanding! Torso's, dismembered arms and decapitated head cover the floor, floors, and your clothes in the gorgeous shades of crimson, claret and mauve... it truly is a sight to behold!

Secondly I'm a builder, hoarder, and looter so being able to build a nice house with ample storage is a major concern. You know what? I'm not disappointed in the slightest... You've got the tools and knowledge to build some pretty cool structures from the outset, but as your character progresses and gains new skills, you become able to learn new technologies and develop your compound further and bolster your defences. There are multiple areas to focus your attentions on, mainly engineering, which effects your building skills overall. then you can build a clinic of sorts, you can livestock, agriculture, mining and blacksmithing, electricity, water processing, and vehicle workshops for example. Hygeine is also a thing in this game, so you can even have your own shower room for washing off those nasty zombie guts!!

Finally, I like to know there is stuff for me to do even when I have everything and looting isn’t a necessity. Well, for now I can see that as the years pass in game, and you’ve had to resolve seasonal issues, such as blizzards, thunderstorms, and dry spells, the number of Z’s in a given area increases, and they also seem to have more runners and climbers... meaning that some areas of the map will offer a real challenge to even the most experienced veteran zombie survivalists.

I see a lot of potential in this game, but that is not to say there aren’t any core elements that can enetertain in their own rights... it has some real thick high density bare bones, and with a little fleshing out, this could easily become the game to replace “those two” games that never were going to be... I’ve had this game for a week, and I’ve already put in almost 100hrs on the same character, but most importantly, I’ve seen 3 “small repair” updates from the Dev. This clearly tells a story of some awesome things yet to come... and quickly too.

One final thought to finish on... Yes you can draw a huge appendage in the snow with your feet... and in certain areas... your 4x4 utility truck, I called mine Nora (that’s the truck I’m talking about by the way).

Buy this game... many times... then give it to your friends, then when they buy it, they can give it to their friends, and soon you will have a community of many friends all killing zombies and friends together.

I promise this will be one of the best decisions of 23.

While i felt it wasn't just reminding me of 7 Days to Die, i just felt like it was a complete ripoff. Some of the sound effects were even the exact same.
Graphic wise it was better and more satisfying, but actually playing it, it was HORRIBLE at best. I hated everything from how small the toolbelt was, to the inventory sorting system taking up too much time compared to what i wanted to spend sorting stuff, the building was.. i'm not exactly the smartest person when it comes to figuring out games, but not exactly the opposite either. The building system was to me not only annoying, but you can't, which is not something i even get why, build on foundations. Yeah i could place a storage box, but not walls or anything resembling the strucure of a shelter. No matter what i did, i couldn't even figure out how to make wooden boards to assemble the goddamn wooden box i tried to make.
And the concept of having in-game recipes? Non existing.
All in all i honestly hate the game. The concept is fine, they had the oppertunity to make an amazing and unique survival game and shat on it.
I'll take bad graphics in 7 Days with their perfected building system any day over this shit.

2/10, the only thing making me not give a straight out 0 was the graphics.

Melee combat is a little off but nice selection of guns, multiple types of zombies some jump some are super slow some are lightning fast.  The smell of your cleanliness attracts them differently, looting and making noise attracts them and their pathing is externally good.  They will smash through doors to get to you.  

Nice crafting tree and skills system.  

Winter is amazing with snow and leaving footprints and tracks in the snow.  

The game has issues but as you learn the system it’s more that it’s not explained well and no tutorials rather then bugs as people say.  Like if a zombie hits you you can’t move for a few seconds  to reload gun or swing back at them.  That’s not a bug that’s you being stunned.  Viral infection and blood loss use a penicillin syringe to cure, or build a bed quick and set a spawn for when you die.  

The building system is involved.  There is a great you tube video  that explains the post structure and how to build properly.   There are many complaints about building bugs and it’s just that they are building wrong.  It’s truly amazing once you learn how to build properly. 

It’s already in a great state just needs better instructions for new players. Also needs some balancing.

Zombies respawn every morning and I think they should not respawn in an area you are in.  Clearing an area to loot isn’t worth it as it takes you most of the day then as your looting they respawn.  

I was attacked by a bear i had 72 bullets in my guns and not that many missed yet it wasn’t enough to take it down.  I havnt killed one but have watched videos of people putting over a 30 round clip into a boar to take it down.  Yet a wolf takes two head shots.  

Frowning food isn’t worth it early game as it takes forever to grow but spoils in like 3 days.  

It’s actually a big map but with everything respawning, it’s hard to explore very far as the sleep and food requirements are steep and with everything respawning you will have to fight your way through to get home or off-road to avoid zombies near the roads.",1675285172,1675285172,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,True

The game is updated, i've tried reinstall the game and my computer is well capable of ''not so demanding'' games such as No one survived. 
However, the little time i get (between the crashes) this game is really enjoyable, a lot to loot, explore, skills to learn and master. I know that it's an early access game and i don't mind minor bugs but the crashing frequently part is a bit to much for me.

Sure, this game use assets like many other indie survival games out there, the character looks a little bit off, but at the end, it's a brutal awesome start for an survival game. Loot, craft, build and (if you want) fight against a horde of zombies. You have to deal with sleep, food, your mindset and so on to keep alive. Sure, it's not as detailed as SCUM - but it's not necessary.

Another thing is the weather during the summer. Rain, dust storm, and then rain again. That's back to back to back in the same day. Could use some work.

Some of the the freaking zombies still gave me the chills when they creep up behind me when I am trying to sniper other walking dead through the scope. 
I wish there are more zombie types in the game, make some tough ones. Add in some traps to set up for defence, more drivable vehicles possible vehicle modifications, like put guns on cars , put spikes on vans. More fun and creative ways to kill zombies and defend the base. Maybe have some difficult bosses to give out rare loots for high class weapons and structures.

3. Fist combat- the way you fight with fists makes you miss the zombie most of the time cause it kind of locks on once you hit.

Good water is scarce especially during the early game so you really have to be diligent in looting, there's a beach near where you spawn but do be careful in drinking because you can get malaria and other health conditions that may effect your character. So yeah, it's really really heavy on survival which I like but I don't know about you so that's why I said you can be the judge for that. As for the other 2 that I mention the graphics and physics, the graphics looks great and the physics is amazing especially when you take down a tree or just be a psychopath and just destroy house is just oddly satisfying but that do mean that you have to really think about the structural integrity of your build otherwise it would just collapse on you,

It's very grindy game. But it is very fun and can be addictive (It is very apparent on how many hrs I have put in this game) :)

(RECENT EDIT)  
After playing for 40 hours here are some of the terrible things of this game that I have encountered.
1.) Fixed spawn/starting location
       -If you die so far away from spawn then be prepare to waste 30 mins to walk from spawn to where you died, oh yeah and also be prepared to lose your mind to die over and over again just to get to the spot where you first died to collect the items and waste more time in the process
2.)  ""INFECTION""
      - This will be your #1 probable cause of death, For whatever dumb reason I get this 80% of the time on every 1st hit of a zombie (It's just rediculous how frequent you get this). Oh also, you can only get a cure of this through a merchant which you can trade with the same value as ak47, OR if you reached medicine 5 and that you are able to craft one yourself. (I mean i get it its a zombie game ofc you can get infected, but the rate on how you get it is stupid)
3.) Hipfire
     - Hipfire of this one is stupid because if you want to take a quick shot on a zombie while running away, your character has to stop for a minute take aim and shoot. Like seriously?

So despite all of this headache and BS, the only silver lining that I have for this one is the building aspect of the game. I guess I just discovered that I am an M.

EDIT: I notice what the people said in the bad reviews and majority of them is just dumb,
 
You can literally change how much zombie spawn, frequency of horde nights and how many zombies will spawn during that horde night, how many materials can spawn and the time interval for the materials to spawn in the options, Regarding about how you die you lose all skills, you can literally turn it off in the options its called permanent death you can uncheck the check mark in the options.

This game have great potential. is already more complete than most of the 'survival games' out there. there is not exp grind to get better, Even with almost zero tutorial in the game itself, is just so intuitive that you don't need any, and the more you advance the more you realise how much more you have to go. 

I've done 45 hours in like 3-4 days, still on my first world and just now i fell like i got near the half of the game. and is a bloody early access. yes there is bugs, yes it is not optimised, but this game is so much better than years old games. if the devs keep updating, and please pay attention to your community and listen to than. this game can go far, really far. i can´t wait to see the mods that will came out for this game. new updates and etc. 

in the end, would i recommend the game? Yes and No, if you like to experience early access games, and don't mind the bugs, and bad optimisation, by all means give it a chance to this game, is a great game.

Explanation somewhere stating that you do not earn skill experience while crafting, unless you are actively on that ""crafting bench"" while crafting, letting it craft and leaving the bench does not earn you experience.

THIS IS NOT MULTIPLAYER. THIS IS ONLINE CO-OP

Unfortunately I have to give it a thumbs down.

     Anyone that says it is like RUST, DAYZ, SCUM etc. Basically any well known PVP player base game. It is not and if you play those games then this is not the game for you. On their discord the PVE players will argue with you to the end of the earth on their FEEDBACK and SUGGESTIONS channels on no PVP elements even though you can already kill each other in the game. All they need to do is add a on/off button on player killing and a party group. Would be beneficial for both PVE and PVP player base for those that want it. Won't effect PVE players at all. I would know since i'm 99.99% a PVE player. HOWEVER all my friends play pvp or pvp elements in games. Which means I lost out on money because I bought this for 2 others to play with me because they do not make it clear that the DEV has ZERO intention to do anything to do with PVP on their STORE PAGE. Even though you can literally kill other players and there is ZERO option to turn that off. 

      So have fun with the griefers when they decide to fork out dedicated servers with zero way to party up so ABSOLUTELY ANYONE can walk into your base and steel your things. ABSOLUTELY ANYONE can dismantle your base and ABSOLUTELY ANYONE can kill you at any given time. You'd have to join their discord and get the same copy pasta response from players (not mods) that DEV has zero intention on having zero pvp elements even though it already currently does. (with no option to turn it off mind you) Super ridiculous? I know. Apparently common sense is not very common. Being able to turn off players hurting other players and a party/group option is very much a PVE element as a pvp one. dumb dumbs. But you know. Clearly i'm the dumb one that doesn't know what I'm talking about despite having played multiple survival games on Solo, Co-OP, Multiplayer, PVE and PVP. 

Until they add those 2 little things to the game. I will keep this as a I DO NOT RECOMMEND AT ITS CURRENT STATUS.

Even then I may still keep it a thumbs down. As they do not deserve my hard earned money or anyone elses if they are just gonna allow put downs. When they are the ones that asked for feedback in the first place. A simple, ""Thanks for your feedback. Currently we aren't looking into adding any pvp elements."" from a mod not a rando. Then delete any replies from rando's. Unless it is a separate feedback. Despite being a PVE player because of how PVP players are treated in their discord. I would return this if i could. And just go play 7 days if i just wanted to play a solo zombie survival game. No reason for me to pay for another game similar to it.

It has everything you ever wanted, however, it definitely needs a bit more streamlining when it comes to controls... I know it's a PC game, but a scrollable tool belt would go a long way.

Also, more translation definitely would help some, bigger icons (skill tree, equipment tabs, etc)

Wishes? 
-More furniture crafting
-Remove aiming dot when holding melee weapons

With that, it's far from perfect here at launch, but it IS fun to play and it does have a lot to do with a big open map to explore.

The developer(s) need to stop relying on Google translate and get someone to actually translate their game to English (and other languages offered as options in the Options of the game.  It's kinda annoying to see Japanese or Chinese text inside the game when you've selected ""English"" in the game options.

The developers also need to make items like stones and other small items stack in stacks higher than 5 in my opinion.  Adding the ability to put markers on the map and then have them show in the game as a beam of light or a direction mark on an overhead compass at the top of the screen would be great as well.  Simple things like this could go a long way to making this game a much more enjoyable experience.  Obviously, adding game servers for the game in the future is something that everyone would like to see and I'm sure the developers are aware we all want.

Other things like  having dogs that we can tame and train in the wild as well as ride-able horses would be very cool.

I haven't experienced any major bugs such as falling through the world, zombies walking through walls or anything game breaking, but there are plenty of minor issues and bugs that I'm sure will be ironed out more as the development in early access continues.

It's a surprisingly good new open world zombie apocalypse survival game in the sea of these games here on Steam.  Time will tell if the developers are actually in this to support it over the coming year(s) or if this was all made just as a quick cash grab.  But even if they never update it again, I still feel that the value here right now is pretty high and high enough to recommend this title.

Even if this game is good, this game has a TON of potential and should wait until this game has received more updates. 
I am keeping this game, and waiting until its in a better state in order to play. 
You are able to change the settings for the zombies, etc when you start a new game. 
But once you do that, that's it... You cannot go back and change them again after starting a save.. Which should be implemented in this game. 

Cons/Disappointments/Nitpicks:
The Autosaves do not do much, I had crashed once and i reloaded my save and it took me all the way back to my manual save. So i lost all of my progress. 

Parts of the translation are still in Chinese and the amount of recovery of food does not give you much AT ALL. I can have like 20 pieces of meat, cooked into soups, etc but still cannot recover all of my stats.. This definitely needs to be tweaked. Like i previously said, this game needs more updates and until then..I will play it again.

Overall, to me, it's like State of Decay, DayZ, Rust (building mechanics), and 7 Days to Die had a baby that is this game. Jumped into it with a friend, skipping the tutorial and going in blind. At first it was a little rough, but we slowly figured out things and got the crafting, surviving basics, and base building down. Played 8 hours our first session and had a lot of fun exploring to build up our ammo for horde night. 

Being early access we still encountered bugs here and there, although they were not game breaking bugs, just minor things like being stuck in ADS speed that can be fixed by hitting shift. For an early access game, the core mechanics were in place, working, and running smoothly right from the start. Was pretty interesting that you have to watch your carbohydrate and protein levels too when it comes to food, adding a layer to the usual survival mechanics we're use to. Another thing we noticed right away is that it's a huge map, which could take awhile on foot, thankfully there's cars you can repair and use.

Speaking of developer interaction, looking on the Steam discussion forums for this game shows the dev responding to a lot of posts about features to be added, QoL stuff, and bugs. For which the dev has responded that they are collecting ideas from the players, working to add the QoL stuff, and addressing any bugs that are reported.

My avatar landed on a beach near a farm. It quickly found basic crafting supplies (sticks and rocks) and was able to jump right into resourcing stockpile materials. As the night quickly ushered in, I found myself in the dark. The moon illuminated the outdoors fairly well, but in a shelter without a torch or campfire might be scary to some.

The dark was nothing to worry over, since my vital stats were plummeting down to zero. There was enough time to attempt to recover from fluid deprivation, but I had no idea how crippling it really is to my immersion. After a death, I switched priority to maintaining decent stats (above 75%).

Since my starter inventory can only hold two dollars, eight quarters, and about 42 cents I wondered how it might look trying to fill a crafting order calling for eight logs a pop (we can only carry two logs at start). While some things stack sensibly, others lack the realism that goes without any thought...like a loaf of sliced bread, we just don't expect to have to place each slice in a already valuable inventory space. Ore stacks (5 each), but not Rocks. Sticks stack but not logs. Fiber  stacks but not tool boxes....okay maybe that shouldn't need to stack. Raw materials always stack, don't they? Isn't that the rule set according to the latest WoTC (Wizards of The Coast). Would a zombie title need such a rigid rule set? Yeah...let's be consistent with something that has worked for nearly 50 years.

I got my money on this title, in spite of obvious Alpha/Beta level concerns. Just like another title, NoTD, everything works and now it's time to tighten some cogs, loosen some springs, and hammer down a continuous improved version until we can charge $39.99 a pop (like some of the other AAA titles). 

I am happy to see a zombie title coming from the Far-East because they have a reputation of seeing things through until the end...Look at Perfect World. Good luck O'Mighty Devs, use the force, nanu-nanu, auf wiedersehen, ciao, bye-bye then, Sayōnara, zàijiàn, Arrivederci, Peace, Salaam-Shalom.",1674086362,1674086362,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

With the time played so far it already has a lot better features and improvements over other zombie survival games. 
It has it's bugs here and there but nothing game breaking so far. 
The trading system is neat & the map is quite large so you have quite a bit to explore even though it's not a random gen map.
Weapons could use some work and maybe a stealth system would also improve the game play some more. 
Base building is really neat and i like how objects are destructible from the zombies, Was terrifying watching a police stations door break and 10+ zombies flooding out chasing me and my friend into the streets.
