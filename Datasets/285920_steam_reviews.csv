as expected, the sandbox vehicle customization and block-based system is very appealing, able to make vehicles of all shapes and sizes for differing purposes. it is very satisfying to be able to beat Techs that daunted you beforehand and getting new weapons that give you the edge in combat. before you know it you have this giant land battleship that trivializes most fights which is a great feeling. you don't even need to build a giant land rover, making cool and unique Techs can give a food feeling when you see things click together.

outside of travel, being able to make Techs that interact with the various resources you get or just be used for purposes outside travel and combat is also satisfying. being able to send giant batches of resources for BB or making an overarching black hole block storage is cool. 

however towards the end the game shows its flaws towards the end because frankly there isn't much to do. you unlock all the licenses of the various Corps and probably max them out, you have a grasp on resource collection and combat, and that is it. there are no end game missions that really challenge you or anything. heck, by maxing the license of a Corp, you can buy parts from them immediately without hardship.

i love going to battle with my big Tech, and it just never gets the chance to flex anymore since everything dies in one or two volleys. like, give me a mission to take down a supergiant Tech or a fleet of larger tryhard Techs or something. that'd be sick.

outside of the end game being lacking, there are a few nitpicks i feel need quality of life fixes. 
- a lack of a block and resource encyclopedia (the resource one in particular because i don't know where a certain resource's biome is, and that's important for fabrication and quests), 
- not being able to move a set combination of parts because doing so just leads to the structure collapsing, 
- no proper tutorial for hovercraft/aircraft making which makes building a chore and needing external resources, 
- big techs causing giant messes with resources you're not gonna pick up all over the place, just a giant laggy mess,
- most terrains having peaks and troughs which makes travel annoying (some biomes are expected but i feel the grassy areas can be a little flatter),
- at some point the missions feel like a chore especially for license maxing.

i enjoyed the game, i finally got to play a game i liked to watch years back, but its issues are notable. i hope TerraTech Worlds builds on what TerraTech does great, and makes the overall experience smoother and more fun.",1708959480,1708959480,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is. But building things is hindered severely by the repressive camera angles. Loading vehicles requires some, but not all, parts to be in your inventory which leads to frustrating inability to switch to your favorite vehicle sometimes. Bad instructions. Controls are bad. Farming is frustrating with the collection system. Building machines is even worse with the camera restrictions. And then a random vehicle spawns RIGHT when you're about to do something big and destroys the base you built. 

The game is really interesting. I like the concept, I like how it balloons into something that I want to spend hours in, designing cool stuff.

However, the combat system ruins everything for me. It's just not fun at all. Most starter weapons have an insanely tiny range, so you have to be next to the enemies to hit them, leading to no variety. You just autolock and hold space until they die. You don't have to aim, no movement tactics, dodging or anything like that. Just mindless space holding. There are weapons with better range and other items that can add some variety, but the intial combat is not fun at all. 
Another aspect I dislike is the whole tech system, where you can save your techs, despawn and spawn them back. Instead of saving the techs themselves, you just take their snaphots, and despawning them just means returning their blocks to the inventory without reserving them, and to spawn them back you need to have all of the required blocks, so it's possible to just not have the needed blocks and being unable to spawn the tech you need. It's just inconvenient.
I initally got this game as a singleplayer alternative to Robocraft without any free to play issues, and Terratech would be exactly that if not for the problems described. Most of it is just my preferences, but the combat system feels the biggest actual issue and a major letdown.

As one example, the first mission is to find a trading station.  Once we found it, the quest didn't complete.  My brother and I tried everything, but couldn't figure out what to do and had to google it.  The solution is to press right-click(!?) on a tiny part of the of the building which doesn't really stand out. The game gives you no indication of this.

As another example, to take off parts and put them into your inventory, you need to enter building mode, drag the items off your car and onto the ground, leave building mode, drive over the items, then enter building mode again and you'll see them in the inventory.  If there is a simpler way, I wasn't able to find it by either experimentation nor googling.

WARNING: There is a bug which makes techs completely disappear. Based on my experience and other complaints dating back to 2017, it seems to be prone to happening when you are very far from techs. They can still show up on the map and minimap, but the blocks will be gone and the thumbnail in the tech manager will be blank. I would recommend checking the tech manager frequently and always maintaining some backup saves which are confirmed to have all techs in tact. This game-breaking bug has existed for several years and can cost a LOT of time.
[/edit]

I had lots of fun playing this. It's far less complex than Besiege. It's also easier to just get into and have fun. The campaign was fun, but eventually it does feel like it just drops out. No more progress, no big significant end accomplishment. Just ""okay, I've unlocked everything now"", and the continued ability to do generic missions, fight techs, and build stuff.

I think the game could be a lot more. But it's a great game as it is. I never played multiplayer, as I only saw a few co-op games going when I looked.

For the Linux crew: My entire play time is on Linux. Runs very well. But like it does in Windows, it will bog down when loading as you approach a base with a lot of machines.

Update:
This game is still loads of fun. I can spend hours building new techs and testing them out. Some of the recently added content is great too.

If any of the devs happen to read this: Please work out a deal with the dev who made the Greentech Corporation mod. I would spend another $20 for Greentech Corp DLC. I was only able to play a broken version of it, as some of the dependencies crash the game without fail on Linux. But even the broken version was a lot of fun to explore and build with.

Cons:
There's no free camera mode and if you've built up your vehicle to be fairly large, any type of building after on a base becomes a pain in the rear, not fun.
The inventory system is needlessly complicated.  There's no way to even put things in inventory until later in the game, so at a good part of the start you only have these ""magnet"" modules which make annoying sounds and have things dangling off of them.

Some of the modules have larger hitboxes than they should, making placement a chore.  Sometimes the snap-to system doesn't seem to work that well for recessed surfaces.  Early in the game you'll be juggling batteries and solar panel towers quite a bit each time your vehicle runs out of energy for the repair systems and shields.

Pros:
Large number of items you can build with, has a campaign, you can pick items off enemy vehicles you've destroyed / anything remaining.  Repair system is easy to use.",1708114391,1708114391,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is a cute little game made for people who really like building LEGO. Since that's basically how it works. You snap pieces together into whatever you can think of. Like hovering tanks with jets. Or goofy-looking cars with auto-targeting missiles. Or a massive tank-treaded behemoth with an ungodly amount of firepower, casting a mile-long shadow over once-peaceful grassy plains.

You start as a scrawny cart with maybe one or two guns, beating up enemy Techs your size and hastily taking their lunch money.

As you destroy more rival Techs, you'll collect the blocks they drop, using them to augment yourself into a perfect killing machine. Missions and building factories will also net you some cool stuff.

Alternatively you can play in creative mode/the R&D Labs DLC, which are both fun experiences that give you the chance to build anything you want.

The game has modding support, ranging from skins to brand-new blocks, weapons, and even more game-changing stuff! (Note: for some mods, you'll need to install an external modloader, but it's a very quick process.)

And, the best part?

From today to February 18th, it's only $4.99/$6.39 with the R&D labs DLC, on sale!

I would definitely recommend buying TerraTech if you or a relative love building games/LEGO. Since there's online co-op, too!",1708106636,1708106636,True,3,0,0.561097264289855957,0,True,False,False

They abandoned the game for a bit over 2 years, multiplayer was a mess, bugs were rampant, and the game ran out of content 30hours in. However, most of these concerns are now gone.

Even though this game was fully released in 2018, there now are consistent updates, the game is almost always on a really good sale, multiplayer has been (ALMOST) fully fixed, and there is a bunch of new content that makes the game that much more vibrant.

Apparently, Payload Studios is working on a sequel and it looks pretty good. The fact they are both making a sequel which is planned to be released this year while updating TerraTech shows their devotion to the series.

I pushed through.

Once I had maxed GeoCorp license and thus the ability to easily make unlimited money from selling chunks and the ability to buy any GeoCorp block, I started to have fun. However.

There was no point where i felt the need to craft any parts.

It is disappointing that factories and miners etc do not operate once the player is over 600m away.

There is no info about blocks, weapon damage, block weight, wheel weight capacity, wheel max speed, aero block lift, battery capacity, power production rate, wheel steering angle, thrust and wheel propulsion, wheel grip, shield power drain rate, not even block HP, there are damage types but no mention of what is weak or strong against those types.

I encountered multiple game crashes while building and there seems to be no auto-save in creative.

Having too many lights can cause low frame rate.

As much as I enjoy building vehicles and trying out new tech, it all feels so damn pointless..

There is no endgame, no real goal to work towards other than unlocking new tech, and the devs have made it clear they have no interest in adding any endgame.

Sure, sandbox games can be cool but the problem is the lack of depth in this game. There is really only two things you can do: Mine the same few resources - which is pointless, as you can eventually just buy all the tech ... not that it makes a real difference in how you build anyway though.
Or shoot enemies. Which becomes boring really fast, as the AI is dumb as a rock and your vehicles become so overpowered so fast they pose no real threat to you anymore.
That's it. Nothing more to work towards. And even the few mods can't really change that.

I guess if you get this on a 50+% sale and you can play it with a friend, it can be worth it for some hours.
Unless you are one of those people who enjoy pure sandbox gameplay, although I would say other blocky vehicle building games like Terratech are a better choice, as they have more varied and more complex building options.

Or wait for Terratech 2, which is supposedly coming out ""soon"" and will (hopefully) have lots of improvements over this.",1704616621,1706770992,False,0,1,0.476190477609634399,6,True,False,False

Payload Studios is releasing a ""Updated"" version of this game. There is no reason for them to make another game and have this continually supported once their newer game goes live. So it is clear Terratech Worlds is the game we'll be playing in the near future.

I bought this game way back then and played it for some time, maybe less than I should've but I've always reached that pinnacle of accomplishment, built bases, ran lines of machinery to make random junk that fueled my massive techs to dominate opposing techs. Usually every major update because the experience of something new was fun to me. I wasted a good deal of time and enjoyed every moment of it, the best kind of ""Waste of time"" as anyone who's familiar with the block-building vehicular combat genre will be spending hours of their time making their favorite machine.

Sadly, there's no reason for me to suggest anyone to get this title with Terratech Worlds on the horizon. I'd highly recommend waiting for that as it comes closer to public release or Early Access.

It's Kinda Fun, But Very Boring, But In Order To Not Break The Hearts Of 8 Year Olds Like My Brother Lower The Price Of Respawning Your Tech By 50%, It Really Shattered Him When He Couldn't Even Afford A Crappy Tech Summon Because He Just Spent All Of His Money On Upgrading His 300,000BB Tech, Please Lower Those Prices.
Additionaly The Game Overall Just Lacks Achivements And Cool Stuff, Also After Like 2 Hours The GEO Corp Heavy Auto Miners Just Stop Mining The Resource, Just Make All Resource Nodes Never Run Out, In Order To Improve TerraTech Here Are A Few Things That I Think Would Really Help:
 1) More Missions, Better Missions.
 Most Of The Current Missions Are Just Boring And Are Like: Drive To The End Of The World, Turn Left And Break A Cube Then Wait 3 Minutes For The Dialog To End, Or Like This: ComE tO a wIErD tECh aNd wAStE 15 Minutes Listening To Him Only To Get 10Xp Points!
2) More Cool Blocks, There Aren't Really Many Cool Blocks In The Game And There's Not Much Interesting, Add More Blocks By Adding Like 5 Or More New Blocks From Each Lisence Only Available After Maxing It Out, However I Think That In That Scenario The Game Will Need To Find The Ballance Between Boring Versions Of Existing Blocks Pretending To Be Cool To Absoloutly Game Breaking.
3) New Lisences & A Resource Change, I Feel Like A Lot Of New Blocks Could Match The GEO Corp Theme, Make The GEO Corp Lisence Going All The Way Up To Grade 5 And Also Many Would Fit In A New Category, When The Experimental Blocks Were Removed And Swapped In The Reticule Research Lisence It Was Really Fun To Mess Around With New Blocks, Add A New Lisence That Goes Up To Grade 5 And Make It Be Really Hard But Not Too Hard, 15000Xp To Reach G2 35000Xp To Reach G3 60000Xp To Reach G4 100000Xp To Reach G5 And 150000Xp To Max It Out, Additionaly It Should Have Really Op And Cool Blocks With New Mechanics But Not Too Op, And The Missions Need To Be Kinda Tough, Give A Lot Of Money & Not Be Tedious, There Needs To Be That Balance Between Missions That Are Kinda Hard And Just Tedious And The Missions Should Also Be Rewarding, And Also Have A Lot Of Ones That Are Kinda Like The SAM Site Ridge In The Fact That They Take Some Time But Are Fun, Really Rewarding, And Allow You To Obtain Incredible Blocks For Their Grade, In The SAM Site Ridge You Are Able To Obtain The GSO Missile Batteries Which Are A G5 Weapon At Only G3, Additionaly The New Lisence Should Have You Being Able To Go On A SAM Site Ridge Like Mission Which Unlocks You The Payload Terminal, Once At Grade 3 You Should Be Able To Access Some Of The Blocks Which Are Currently Unavailable Even In The R&D Labs Like The Shield Bubble Thingy Protecting The SAM Site Ridge Robot Which Completely Impenetrable, Additionaly Much Like GEO Corp, I Think We Need Another G3 Early Game Lisence With Some Cool Stuff, Like Batteries Which Are Actually Creative Unlike The Current Ones Which Are Just More Space Efficient With Each Lisence Going Forward, And Some Custom Blocks, Maybe A Dual Mode Weapon Which Can Either Fire Normal Shots Very Quickly Or Fire Strong Cannon Shots At Normal Speed, Additionaly I Think That Once Maxing Out This Lisence You Should Be Able To Unlock A New Machine In The Manufacturing Tab Exclusive To That Lisence Called: ""THE REINFORCER"" Or Something Like That, The Reinforcer Will Have A Block Pickup Slots Functioning Like The Scrappers' Block Pickup Slot In The Way They Pickup The Blocks, That Side Will Only Accept Volatile Type Blocks And The Other Will Only Accept A Special Component Made In The Component Factory From A Conveyor Belt, The Machine Will Also Have A Second Block Storing Slot But For The Output, Once Both The Special Component And The Volatile Block Will Be Placed In Their Respective Slots In The Machine The Machine Will Take Them And After 3 Seconds Output The Armored Version Of The Block Which Will Look Slightly More Armored, I Think The Price Should Be Not Too Much But Not Too Little, Considering The Amount Of Weapons Used On Techs I Think 1 Celestian Crystal And 1 Euridian Crystal Is That Sweetspot For The Correct Cost Of Producing This Special Part, Additionaly The New G3 Lisence Could Have Its Own Version Of The Component Factory But With A Twist, The Components All Cost Slightly Less To Manufacture, Additionaly Both New Lisences Should Have Their Own Scrappers And Fabricators For Their Blocks
4) Money, All Of My OG Lisences Are Maxed Out And I Would Really Like It If When You Get XP For A Maxed Lisence It Would Give You Money Like Maybe: 1 GSO Xp -> 1 BB, 1 GEO Corp Xp -> 6 BB, 1 Venture Xp -> 25 BB, 1 Hawkeye Xp -> 250 BB, 1Xp From The New G3 Lisence -> 350 BB, 1 Better Future Xp -> 500 BB, 1 Reticule Research Xp -> 1000 BB, And 1 Xp From The New G5 Lisence -> 2500 BB

So, turns out this was basically a demo/prelude for the next game, that's why it was basically abandoned and turned into a DLC skin farm.

I recommend the game but only for a few hours of fun, but 10 hours in you're invincible and have everything, and nothing will ever change. Buy it on sale and don't bother with any skins DLC, they really aren't worth it.
Yes, the skin packs helped fund ""TerraTech Worlds"", but it looks like a graphically better, stripped down version of TerraTech from 2014/15. So I have to ask, will that too be abandoned after 5 years in Early Access and then 1-3 years full release on Steam too?

I got almost a thousand hours in TerraTech, there isn't anything I don't know about it... but it quite simply isn't finished and with Worlds announced... it never will be. So there's one hell of a sting there.

Comments are open and welcome, but if Payload see this, I want to be proven wrong in TerraTech Worlds, it's on my wishlist, but you've dented my hopes for a finished game with how you treated TerraTech.

Awesome combat and build system but poor camera view and force crafting need to be removed.
Put cab on the craft build of Mike the stupid robot and after you past the stupid xp forced crafting to get a  blue print in your journal by entering the cab on the build taking a photo and now you can go to it for a build reverence.  No one care about the stupid crafting with it slow description of how to craft thing from Mike the robot idiot to just get XP, what a joke just give us the dam thing, Crafting is unnecessary to do and really frustrating to deal with and locking you into this view making everything so dam frustrating but over all i can still enjoy the build just wish that it would fix the view.  The newer version 1.5.4 will not work well on multiplayer has so many bug not even fun and if i try to do single player i get the error file is not saved and kicks me off and but I can play single player on 1.5.1 will not work on multiplayer both needs to be fixed. 
""Number One issue is still the camera view it is so Frustrating to work with in the build system.""  Never seen one game yet that knows how to make a good flying mechanics.
Hope they can fixes the newer version but still the game has a lot of cool things in it that i feel deserves a thumbs up for some good game play but with out any real goals or story this is just endless play that for a short time is fun an then become a rinse and repeat game of the same game play.  This is what a lot of games are doing today and know wonder no one buys there games.  What it needs is a neat story and a cool ending of him returning to his home plant.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

[OLD REVIEW] So why is this review negative? Because the game is broken. The game has been broken for years. Depending on the bug you get depends on wether your game save is completely bricked or not.

After 40 hours, my main storyline quest wasn't able to be handed in. i then spent another 10 hours in game and many more trawling online only to find out that if reloading your save doesn't fix it (it didnt) then your just screwed. 

I could restart i guess, i enjoyed the first 40 hours- but i'm one of those people that doesn't enjoy doing the exact same thing again only to get back to the exact same place i was at only to risk the exact same thing happening. [OLD REVIEW ENDS]

If you've read this far, discard everything i wrote above. I'm only leaving it in as a testament to both what happened, and the response to what happened. Shortly after making this review a dev contacted me, fixed my issue and i'm about to go spend far too much more time playing. This isn't one of those games where the devs release then forget about. These aren't the sort of devs that ignore their community.

These are the sort of game creators that care, actively, and will work on making sure you can continue to enjoy your product. The response to me in fixing my problem was quick and professional despite them working on a new game. If you want to support game devs that make good games while actively making sure their IP's are both playable, working and enjoyable then you should buy this.

If you have any problems like i did, please contact the Terratech team via email or any other method that they have set up to solve our problems. They will do everything they can to fix it for you.",1704400287,1704975291,True,0,0,0.559819400310516357,4,True,False,False

coming back to this game i saw this review and honestly i havent had more fun playing any game, i might have an unfair bias, this game is almost 10 years old.. or maybe it is and gets constant updates.. even when they are currently making its sequel..
putting 500 hours into a game is a feat, with this game its easy.

this game is a lesson, if you are willing to learn from it.. your creativity is this games limits.

full text with deeper mechanics and bugs didn't fit here

It's one of those base-building+fighting games. An offshoot of survivalcraft genre, where tracking your body's metrics is replaced with production lines and automation.

In this game you have a giant repetitive open world with a patchwork of the same biomes. Each feels big in the beginning, when your vehicle is the size of an ant, but in a flying end-game minecrawler you can fly over biomes very fast. Yet i've never reached the end of the world, even on a 700 km/h rocket it was taking too much time.

You pilot a vehicle and fight bots, randomly pulled from the cloud of user-generated cars and dropped not far from you. I never saw user-made planes, choppers or bases. When you destroy enemy's cabs the surviving parts fall off and you can attach them to your RoboCraft-Crossout monstrositat right in the field with no pause like in Captain Forever Remix. Thankfully without a time limit. But with a possibility of a similar pressure — another bot can spawn in range and start attacking.

The combat mechanic is basically absent — you can shoot or not. All guns have auto-aim with extreme bullet drop. It seems the mortars are very popular judging by all the user-generated cars driven by bots. But they are so short-ranged my main car was destroying everything before getting damaged. Even the starting lasers have a very long range and then you unlock missiles.

The assembling GUI is really bad. It's giant, with no scaling options, the controls are bad. I literally couldn't see most of anything when the building GUI was open. And you can't do anything without keeping it open. When you attach parts you roughly aim at a highlighted free connector on the vehicle and press [next] or [previous] while the game tries each and every combination of the part's connectors and rotations. And some parts have hundreds of connectors, each with four rotations. Genius. What was wrong with the industry-standard method of picking the connector and then rotating the part in three axiis? And it all is done from the unwieldy camera's PoV. So you also have to aim the connector at a connector from either too far away, or from up too close, with some things obstructing the view of other things. And then there are parts which plain do not work. Like pivots and axles.

== missing chunk ==

The achievements work fine. They are of different interestingness. The one which asks to make a ton of money is a boring grindathon. Moneymaking is not that fast in best of times. Your mining-refining-selling rigs don't work out of sight. Your minecrawler is not that fast. Even if you reach the flat biome with the most expensive materials — the surface has pittance. Constant fighting can force you to spend money on repairs. When you are trying to build a vehicle for some of the non-combat quests — some giant bots are constantly spawning to pester you. When you drive a scrapper to turn your foes into cash — only tiny cars are spawned. And going against an invasion vehicle can rarely leave you unscathed. Only giant choppers and planes can usually be out of their reach, but they take a lot of time to destroy just one invader. Quest rewards are not that big and they usually send you on 9 km long hikes through mountains.

This old-ish game has bugs, and they are on rotation. The patches still come out, and every-time they fix one thing the other breaks. When i've reached mid-game they've released a patch which makes the button ""load game"" to have a 60% chance to start a new game instead. With an unskippable long cutscene. As i mentioned, at first conveyors were crashing the game. And some block plain do not work. The game has very bad performance even on medium settings on my 10900k 32 RAM 3080ti. I have about 30-40 FPS with slowdowns.

It's an interesting game allowing for some creativity. But its numerous issues bar it from greatness. I liked playing it, but i can't say that everyone has to try it, because it makes me remember every problem and frustration i've encountered.

I'm sure this game is fun and it does look awesome, but upon booting it up I quickly learned you can't map the left or right mouse button (which are the two MAIN buttons I want to edit to make the game playable on keyboard) and controller schemes are locked so tilting up on the analog stick to move makes my steering horrendous as my fingers aren't great anymore instead of gas pedal like triggers. Which in turn caused me to chase tutorial enemies in circles at the very beginning for two minutes when it literally takes like 5 seconds to kill them if you actually it them. So I'm completely over workaround remapping and ""just get used to it"" kind of game play then having to fix my controls back to normal through steams big picture for the rest of my 99% games that work just fine. Reading discussions and forums this has been an often requested feature over the years.

I have to say it is a great game and was worth my money and I am looking forward for Terra Tech Worlds!

I liked :
+++ Replayability, I have done the ""campaign"" and all the corporations to max about 10-15 times
++ ~30 hours of gameplay to reach endgame.
++ Endgame is fun, crafting big techs or bases is what i really love to do
++ Creative AND survival are both enjoyable, either you like making techs or scavenging in survival
+ Diversity of items/blocks and their interactions 
+ Complexity of techs (vehicles you make) can be very in depth (especially with flyers)
+- Descent physics, especially flight and zero gravity vehicles, sometimes can be a little buggy however
+- Controls can be a little hard to use, but with the custom controls menu it is become less of an issue
+- Graphics aren't bad, but if you want that you'll need to wait for Terra Tech Worlds
+- Multiplayer isn't the strong point of this game as it is mostly single player, but can be played with multiple players

a)Block rotation. Rotation is currently one button and toggles through all the possible rotations *in sequence*. It's as bad as it sounds. A multiple-key system to rotate on different axis' and shift the block left/right would be a godsend. 

b) Poor snap placement. The snap placement is completely unintuitive; if you try to place a cab chassis on a cab it will rarely, if ever, actually snap to the correct placement. Likewise, repeatedly placing an item in the same orientation doesn't always lead to it snapping to that orientation; you may have to rotate it each and every time. 

Lastly, the ability to aim manually would also be a significant improvement, as auto-aim does a poor job of accounting for movement and doesn't let you aim very precisely at all.

Seemingly simplistic and unambitious, but the reality is that it's the exact opposite of ""ocean wide and an inch deep"". Terratech's maybe a few inches wide, but there's definitely at least a mile of depth here.

In terms of only an inch wide, the building mechanics are extremely intuitive and easy to grasp, just grab a block with your cursor and connect to a different block via their attachment points. Only some basic physics are simulated like mass, gravity, inertia, but it fits the game very well and allows things to remain intuitive. The campaign and NPCs are no doubt too simplified, and I wouldn't mind a more difficult and varied challenge and a reason to build and experiment, but these are secondary in this game and serve only as a unlock/progression conduit.

On the other, mile deep hand, the number of different shapes and functions of the blocks makes it so fun and engaging. From getting your first Frankenstein's monster by adding bits of your defeated foes to your own vehicle and letting it grow to a chaotic, unsightly mountain of a monstrosity. Unbalanced, moving on an ill fitting set of wheels and tracks of various sizes and purposes, bristling with random selection of weaponry, everything scavenged from the burning wrecks of your enemies. To your elegant and deadly, streamlined to perfection, pre-planned and carefully crafted, heavily armoured and armed flagship that is maybe a tank, a mining and refining complex, a flying fortress, or maybe all 3 at once. A behemoth that can obliterate any size target from beyond the horizon in a matter of seconds. And everything between these two extremes.

The building mechanics are vastly improved from the time I first played it many, many years ago. Back then, even building a simple mining, refining, selling structure was a major pain steeped in tedium and frustration. There is rarely any need to alt-tab to check wiki or forums about something specific. Building still could use many improvements though, like drag building conveyor belts, mirror building, exploded view for inspection of deep internals in large builds, modular building - now you can only place blocks one by one (patch 1.5.3 from a month ago introduced a new connecting block that allows modularity though).

Where the game falls short is the counterpart to its extremely fun building loop, the world where your creations live. There just isn't anywhere near enough challenges and reasons to build and experiment with different types of crafts and structures. The terrain, despite having fairly varied biomes, only ranges from very flat to slightly bumpy, even in the ""mountains"". The biomes areas are very small and scattered around in random patches. The world doesn't change as you travel, you just go, very quickly, through the same bits of grassland, desert, salt flats, hills etc. There's almost never any necessity to purpose build something to allow progression, the entire world just blends into colourful patchwork. I would love it if the biomes were much larger, both horizontally and vertically so that making a helicopter to get to the top of the mountains, or a speeder to get through the salt flats would make sense.

I've had some of the most fun during the Slippery Slope challenge, where you have to build a very specific vehicle and have restricted blocks. After an hour of failing I managed it with a tiny car utilizing a weapon with extreme recoil, mounted backwards to help me move through the obstacle course. I just wish there were more reasons to build something specific as now it boils down to making several blueprints for vehicles - regular tank, hover tank, fast tank, flying tank, and structures - defence turret, charging station, autominer template, refining and selling template. I still had plenty of fun doing those, but the game has so much unrealised potential that it leaves me wanting more.

Having said all that, not only the devs are still adding new qos features and blocks to Terratech, but they have a new game - Terratech Worlds in development, which seems to be addressing the majority, if not all of my wishlist for this game. I can't wait for that to release.

In the meantime, I'd absolutely recommend Terratech even at full price.",1703257312,1703257671,True,42,0,0.830665886402130127,0,True,False,False

A jet fighter with spinning drill wings? Why not? The charm lies in this infinite canvas for your madcap creations, fueled by constant updates from the passionate devs. They're like mad scientists themselves, injecting the world with new biomes, crazy weapons, and endless creative possibilities.

In general terms, the single player campaign gives you a loose purpose: you need to face off against other techs to acquire parts and run missions to level up your faction license. This also allows you to unlock additional faction licenses which enable you to play other types of techs. Techs in general scale upwards in difficulty based upon the size and power of the tech you're currently using. You don't have to just play with the techs you've built either, you can establish elaborate industrial complexes, provide them power with various types of consumable/renewable energy, set up production queues that allow you to sort and program intelligent operations, and defend them all with automated defensive turrets. Unfortunately, these complexes don't seem to remain alive in memory if you're not in the general area, and given that you can't seem to teleport across the world from one base to the next, it really limits you to building in only one location in single player (in cooperative multiplayer, you're always tethered to the host's position). You can switch to a high speed tech to save on travel time, and then transition into a more functional tech when you arrive where you want to go, but it can also be a nuisance to recharge all your batteries if you have a particularly large tech you want to use. I didn't find the single player or multiplayer campaign restrictive, but it was definitely the various multiplayer modes are where it was most enjoyable for me. There's lots of flexibility both working collaboratively and playing competitively. Overall, the game has also progressed fairly well from it's original release, and there have been a number of quality of life improvements since I started playing.

Would recommend most of all for people who enjoy the construction and design aspect, but it's not super complicated engineering, and you can also skip that entirely by sharing tech designs with friends or downloading from the workshop if you're not particularly fond of building.",1702876512,1702876512,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Multiplayer still does not have crafting. Also, when you play co op, you are ""tethered"" to the other player and neither of you can go outside a certain range of each other. If anyone wants to go anywhere, both have to go. This is due to the engine.

Speaking of the engine, it severely limits the game. It is too far ahead for them to remake it, and I think the engine will be the downfall of this game if it isn't already.

1 - It's super buggy. Usually, this doesn't matter, being mostly minor physics bugs, but occasionally you'll find a crash bug or worse. I've had a bug that completely broke a part of the mission progression in a campaign and I had to delete that file. 

2 - There isn't much to do. This game doesn't have much of a storyline besides connected missions, and it shows. You'll mostly find yourself doing the exact same thing over and over again, and while that thing is fun, it gets old quickly. 

If you really like the building and physics systems, you'll probably find yourself having the most fun in R&D labs building random bullshit and not with the campaign.",1667739453,1702147839,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

With a vast library of blocks at their disposal, players can freely design and assemble their own unique vehicles, limited only by their imagination.

I've been acquainted with this game for a long time, and even after all these years, opening it up still brings out the child in me, as if I'm playing the coolest ""building block"" game.

Recently, I learned about the development team's new plan called ""Terratech Worlds,"" and it's evident that the game engine has been upgraded. Now, the planets feature rivers and lakes, and I can't help but wonder what surprises await with the introduction of water-based vehicles. I remember a time when I struggled with my rudimentary English (which, to be honest, hasn't improved much), trying to express my anticipation for more complex alien environments and the need for groundbreaking vehicles to navigate them.

After almost 1000 hours across 2 steam accounts and after playing since 2016 this game means a lot to me, But I think its time I voice my opinions on the many flaws i think this game has and I would love if got fixed by the Developers.  

Now for the rant...

First, Base building is pretty much non existent. some mission content being removed(Yet I understand removing the base building ""tutorial"" missions as pretty much all base building components being removed, but still.) , especially some of my favorite missions, and just a lot of other things removed which is a big killer for this game for me and my friends, and now I understand the world borders, but C'mon make it an option or something as it is an absolute pain having to either wait for your friends to catch up to you or being limited when flying to a little circle around your group. And IMO the MOST annoying of all of these ""flaws"" is that you all have to stick togethor and cant all go do different missions which makes everything take longer and makes the game a lot less fun when playing with a big group.

With all that said, If you don't plan to play with friends I highly recommend it besides the occasional bugs its a great experience can do just about anything you want, But multiplayer/co-op is just so limiting it take most of the fun of the game out. Yes, it works. Does it work well? IMO No. ( I personally do not see myself playing this game with friends anytime in the future until these things are fixed. )

If you don't feel like reading, to sum it all up if you want to play with friends do NOT get the game, But if you plan to play solo I recommend it overall, I give Terratech a 9/10 in solo, but a 6/10 in multiplayer.",1701482745,1701482745,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But... making a base to produce items is such a pain I just don't want to deal with it in the campaign. You have to individually place convayer belts, then if you go further than 500m from the production the game causes it to freeze and does not produce the item, then you get parts constantly on the convayer belt that are needed but the production facilities don't pull from the convayer. It's just too painful!

Lost an item by accidentally dragging it into a trade center, which is extremely easy to do since you probably want to build near a trade center. Extremely annoying AI always tries to get behind you. Weapons do not aim where the enemy is going but rather where the enemy is, making you miss every shot while the enemy is moving. Thimble collector resources (tractor beam) gets stuck in your craft. Something doesn't feel right about the environment, feels like it's missing variety. Some things are not explained at all. Most items will be left on the ground and cannot be sold. Enemies may roam around and attack these objects (or the seat block). Some of these things you can not get back until you progress a quest state that unlocks them, causing momentary annoyance. You will get new shipments and parts in the wild, these seemingly have to be applied to your current craft or attached to the new seat and taken control of in order to get them to the base. What you want to do is put those parts into a storage or teleport it where they need to be, or get the shipment sent to a specific location, all from the very start. Items snap weirdly and aren't smartly rotated by default. Apparently the game may also crash instead of shutting down when you tell it too. 

And THIS is what a very positive rating game looks like! It's a huge disappointment and a trap! Do not let the rating be the only thing that convinces you to buy the game, even on a discount, some things are just far too frustrating to deal with.

Both of these exist in equal measure and I can't decide between them half the time. Let's run down what leaves me feeling this way:

+ The building system is phenomenal. Making techs, making turrets, and making terrifyingly complex money-laundering factories is all really fun. It's quick, simple, and evokes a sense of playing with something like LEGO.
- There is no 'safe mode' for building. When building, you MUST consider the time of day and the presence of any enemies nearby. You may not pause. You must always think about how long it will take. As well, all buildings you make are destructible - even the harmless, inactive ones.

+ The snowballing of your tech's power can be absolutely addictive. When you make your tech stronger bit by bit until anyone who even remotely looks at you wrong gets eviscerated, it's satisfying as hell.
- The same effect can and will apply to you. Powerful techs can be dropped in at a moment's notice and crush you into dust if you're unlucky. The autosave system is also incredibly bad at *not* saving seconds before and/or after disaster.

+ Making your perfect, automated manufacturing plant that handles every resource perfectly is sometimes more fun than games based entirely around that mechanic, whereas here it's merely a side project.
- The grind to get resources for money, as well as the fact it leaves you and your constructs open to danger, can be utterly agonizing.

So, that should help explain things. You may notice a theme - I'm quite fond of most mechanics, but the combat and grinding can really drag the experience down. This game is a weird case where I love just as much as I hate. So, why am I recommending it? Simple; If you are willing to accept these flaws, this game pulls off most of its mechanics better than ANY alternative on the market. As well, updates are constant and mod support is pretty good. If you can bite the bullet on the worse parts of the game, there's so much charm and care put into every corner of the game.

... Except how you can change enemy strength in the sandbox mode but not in the campaign. I'm begging for this to become an accessibility feature someday.",1700803217,1700803217,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You can make your own vehicles/bases/whatever or borrow someone elses, so long as you're having fun. Just be warned that as of the time of this review, the game can get very laggy, although the devs have definitely improved that and will surely continue to do so.

You can build and drive any vehicle you want. So long as you got the money and/or ressources to craft them. To get access to better blocks from the different corporations you'll have to complete quest for them, be it destroying some rogue/rival prospectors in a certain area, by collecting and selling the specified ressources or doing certain challenges.

Driving in this game is good. At least, until you get to rougher terrain, then it becomes strangely slippery but you car never flips. Even if you're hovering above the ground, you're gonna feel every bump on the way up a mountain. It makes driving through anything that is slighlty mountaineous a chore. It's even worse when you fall into a big hole and the only way out is by using the slow moving tractor beam.

The world you'll be travelling in is... Basic. It's procedurally generated and is overall flat. Biomes do have a distinct identity and specific resources appearing on them, but they blend into one another easily aside from like, 3.
Most of the resources (trees, ore outcrops and oil wells) are bunched together. But they don't respawn, at least as I can tell, so you'll have to explore. In fact to take quests and sell resources, you'll often need to find a GSO outpost.

Ok now fighting. Its pretty intense, as long as the AI isn't driving itself in a ditch. You won't ever find an actual player in the game, but you'll definitely see player made creations. You can easily tell it was made by a player if it is covered in weapons. But in general, you'll mostly see generic vehicules from every faction. They're all agressive, unless you have far more DPS than them, they'll just run away without even shooting.
Speaking of the weapons, there's a large variety of them. From small short range laser to massive naval battleships. The great majority of them aim automatically towards enemy cores, but you're the one that tells them WHEN to shoot. This gives the game some strategy, though I found that covering yourself in GeoCopr armor, having Hawkeye shields and weapons usually allows you to facetank everything.

During your time exploring and fighting, you'll have some really good music. Be it ambient or a fighting music, it alwasy keeps a wild-west vibe. Seriously, that's the best part of exploring. You feel like you are an old prospector on a gold rush, but this time in space. There's even a banjo and/or accoustic guitar in almost every song, its great.

The game's good, core mechanics work solidly, there's a surprising amount of different things to utilize, the artstyle's unique and simplistic enough that i managed to mod it to a limited degree despite having zero prior skills (which by the way, modding scene's quite a thing, albeit it works best with a sideloader/companion application), the skill floor and ceiling is.. janky. It's not really that difficult, mostly in the early game and a select few instances beyond it, however losing your battlecruiser on wheels can be *really* costly if it is actually outmatched overall, especially if you've managed to increase the difficulty with something like working plane ai. Kind of encourages either cheesing encounters if possible or abusing saves. Or you could make something nimble and relatively replaceable. The high end of skill is mostly in airships (either antigrav or the beneficial hoverbug) and/or trying to make something meta and/or look good, the highest end is *very* blatant when you see it.

Game's selling point is seemingly that simplicity, it's simply not built to carry a more hardcore community (i would not consider myself one of those sorts, despite the hours) unlike some other games, particularly From The Depths where's it's the polar opposite. Does make it pretty accessible to younger kids though, which *is* what the game's target audience is.

On more negative ends, the game is partially botched on a fundamental level, quite a few bugs (like crafting which is riddled with them) alongside other things like being a single core game and still poorly optimized enough that the console versions are significantly more strict on what you can have down at any time, particularly the switch. It's also fundamentally a singleplayer game, what is working in multiplayer is nothing short of a miracle, especially crafting, because it's been pretty much stapled onto the game.
There's also the community. Since this is a game aimed towards kids that wouldn't be allowed on discord due to age it's quite the mess. Not inherently bad, but you're going to see and get quite the range of things, not to mention the bad apples you get with a community full of young kids.

Generally speaking, the game's good but not exceptional, the community's.. weird. Probably something neat to check out if you're having a stroke over complexity in other building games. Or if you find it comical to mod in the chance of a 5 pack turret squad to mow down your early-midgame tech out of nowhere.

Like the best strategy is making a tech with stairs and then putting guns on said stairs. That being said you can do some really cool stuff like combining 2 techs making it one tech, or making a car that breaks the sound barrier, and make the slowest flying jet known to man. then missions roll around which are completely optional for the most part, (fucking venture) as you kind of get most of everything from killing other techs. in my 20 hours i only really encountered 1 annoying mission where you have to use a plane to destroy rebel techs that are on pillars, and if you touch the ground you die not to mention the fact that the plane uses possibly the worst weapon in the game. And your reward for destroying the techs is i think 10 or 20 thousand credits back on your purchase of the plane  and the plane cost's 50 thousand credit's. and that's the worst one (in my 20 hours) but all the other missions are pretty good all things considered. The combat is great. It makes you feel like an unstoppable god mowing down techs that are pretty big, and if you want a challange, get invaded, and let the enemy tech charge up its shields and all that other junk and once its done then you either get clobbered by the enemy tech or kill the enemy tech.

Overall, the game is great, especially for people who enjoys crafting and battle and therefore I will still recommend it.
The cons however, might make this unsuited for everyone to buy.

First off, there are certain quality-of-life functions that the game does not provide and thus makes things unnecessarily more difficult:
1. Every change you make to your vehicle / base is permanent
2. There is an undo button but it only appears IF you remove a connecting piece and everything falls apart
3. Because small changes are permanent, you will find pieces you accidentally moved turn into a treasure hunt (trying to find where you accidentally stick that piece to)
4. Additionally, items fly when you move them sometimes EVEN THOUGH you did not let go of the left mouse button (that means that get flung away altho you didn't do that), because if the mouse move out of the screen, you click and hold is cancelled and without a good undo option, its gone (sometimes the piece will fly to under another building where you'll find your missing piece much later, sometimes it just disappear under other blocks and you need to remove the outer parts to discover it hidden within)
5. Your base can topple for no reason. I had a 4 foundation fence with guns. i see 1 foundation destroyed and the whole building is overturned on the ground. I did not remove any anchors and there are 3 foundations left. 1/2 the pieces are broken on the floor and I had to send the rest of the items to my inventory.

Second, I feel the content is rather limited, the main gameplay in singleplayer sticks to questing and leveling. Resource hunts are not fun. Getting money / credit is a grind. There are cool vehicles that appears here and there to attack you, why can't there be vehicles that appear when guarding resources? Or if there is, i have yet to encounter any so far.

Third, flight seems difficult. I am at the point in game where I am getting hover parts and propellers + plane engines. I've tried several builds but there are no way to make this smooth enough for combat. Maybe because i shoot and fly too fast to do enough damage and spend most of my time trying to adjust. Also the bump damage hurts my vehicle too much so far. Lastly, I feel that the planes cannot recharge batteries for shields and repair modules as easily as a land vehicle and the vehicle furnace I need is not unlocked so far for mobile recharge - besides i doubt this will be easy either because i cannot farm wood / fuel easily from the air. I will try to resolve the above using 100% hovercraft parts, maybe this will elevate things but doesn't remove how forward propellers, wings, and rotary blades doesn't feel fluid.

Fourth, there are many bugs unsolved in this game imo, like things that gotten harvest AI deleted. Its been 5 years since the game release and its still unsolved.",1698067491,1698067491,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Story missions might not load after accepting them; there is a marker on the map, but nothing spawns when you get there. There is no fix for this bug, which also appears to be a couple of years old. You have to start a new game or load a save before the bug occurred. This happened to me twice with different missions, causing me to lose a lot of the progress.

In co-op mode, you can spawn whatever tech you want from your saved ones, duplicating the parts and ruining the progression.

Placing parts is uncomfortable; sometimes, you have to rotate a part a dozen times before it's where you want it to be. There are no separate X, Y, and Z placing controls, like in kerbal space program, for example.

Wheel steering cannot be turned off.

Finally, developers have reached the point where they made weapon grouping possible through use of logic blocks. Look for Reticule Research Keybinder block, and once you find it, you will have whole 10 groups for weapon/equipment grouping. Enjoy!

[u]Update, 16/02/2023 (Negative)[/u]:
Years have passed, developer continuously sent email ads to buy skin packs, whilst not implementing a crucial QoL feature, custom keyboard shortcuts for modules/module groups, despite answering almost 4 years ago that they're working on it. Impossible work it seems.

[u]Original, 22/02/2019 (Negative)[/u]:
Will change to positive once per-module customizable hotkeys will be implemented.

@Doc Robotnik, controls are ok for small vehicles. But absolutely unopperable for huge mobile factories equipped with multitude of modules and weapons. And the game is exactly aimed at having such monstrous vehicles in command.

So yeah, after 40 hours of gameplay, when you ride massive monstrous factory full of guns, missiles and anything you can imagine it is absolutely frustrating that you can only fire everything at once without having ability to define even simplest weapon group shortcuts. This is also why it is only 40 hours, and not 400.

There was even [url=https://forum.terratechgame.com/index.php?threads/0-7-4-nuterra-v0-4-2-worldeditor.9049/]unofficial mod[/url] that added per-module type hotkeys.

You need to gather resources for one, this is largely an annoyance at the larger scale with no option to automate half the resources because for some reason, while I cant think of a single game similar mechanics are an issue, the dev here couldnt get AI resource harvesters working, which honestly sounds ridiculous to the point Im not sure I believe it.

The other even bigger issue is the conveyor systems. They dont operate intuitively, or based on visual markings, you cant control the direction of them if they are 1 tile long, you need to have isolated loops for the resource calls from manufacturing buildings to work, but then theres no way to do all that while accounting for overflow.

The rest of the game is kind of basic, filled with the same enemies over and over, even though theres meant to be a system that uses player saved designs to invade other players, I still see the same designs in the rare invasions, and it obviously must not apply to the normal enemy spawns because I definitely keep seeing only a small handful of enemies repeatedly, with a noticeable lack of enemies designed from the higher tier parts I've unlocked and use on my own vehicles.

The game definitely needs the following:
1. Resource automation in the form of either mobile harvesters or expanding mining nodes for all resources.
2. A simpler conveyor system, full connections between loops, or a kind of filter block to pull orphaned resources not travelling to storage or to be used.",1694252727,1694252727,False,2,0,0.432835787534713745,0,True,False,False

Played: March 2023

I actually completed this game twice in a row only taking a break of about one week.  Since it is relatively short, I felt like playing it again to see how much quicker I could complete it (less than half the time).  With no discernable ending to the game, I chose the ""End"" to be when I maxed out full XP in each of the corporations: GSO, GeoCorp, Venture, Hawkeye, Better Future and Reticule Research.

After first testing the game a few years ago and not liking how quickly your starting GSO vehicle gets damaged having to rebuild it, I stopped playing.  I didn't want to have to deal with that constantly.  I should have given it a further test as once you get into the GeoCorp parts your durability greatly increases, even though your weapons still stink.  So how did I get better weapons?  I watched a Let's Play video by someone and saw them defeat the bridge guard that stands alone on a small short bridge.  The only bridge like that in the game.  If you can defeat that enemy you can get a number of Hawkeye weapons very early in the game.  It's not easy, and requires you to stay to his side and not let him hit you with his powerful weapons as you pick him apart.  Save before trying this method.

There's some debate online as to which corporation has the best weapons.  My favorites ended up being anything Homing, like the homing missiles that both Venture (Venture Avalanche Launcher) and Hawkeye (Hawkeye Cruise Missile) have.  GSO (GSO Missile Battery) also has homing missiles but you have to get lucky finding them on an enemy you destroy since you can't purchase them until your GSO XP enters the final Level 5 stage.  And if you do find any of these, don't let them get destroyed otherwise you won't be able to redeploy that vehicle if parts are missing and you don't have unused replacements in your inventory!!!

Other than weapons, my favorite vehicle body parts remained GeoCorp's big yellow blocks.  There are so many to find from defeated enemies and the largest (GeoCorp Behemoth Wheels) worked best for me in climbing over the steep landscape.  My big vehicle was slow though with a top speed on the salt flats of about 46 mph.  I later replaced the two rear tires with the largest (Venture Titan Wheels) which increased my speed to 66 mph.  I kept the front two tires Behemoths since they stuck further out and helped climbing the steep hills.

Another important thing to do is construct a vehicle with a pivoting anchor in the center bottom of your truck.  This allows for you to anchor your vehicle and still pivot your vehicle all while deploying a rear attached SCU.  Remember those three letters ""SCU"".  Hopefully you can get a SCU early on in the game as they let you gather destroyed vehicle parts so much faster.  If you get one or two, think about attaching one to the rear of your vehicle so you can deploy the anchor and gather parts quickly.  Finding relatively flat ground to anchor on can be tricky though.  Near the end of the game, the (Better Future Sky Anchor) on a ground vehicle is a dream come true.  Nearly any ground formation can be anchored on and it even lets you move and drive your vehicle a short distance to position yourself for loot and fighting all while sucking up parts in the SCU.

Eventually, you're going to need to use different smaller vehicles to complete the mission challenges for speed tracks, hover obstacle courses and flying planes.  The default vehicles the game gives you are usually good enough, but some required tweaking to make them better.

And lastly Invaders... when an invader warning appears I recommend positioning yourself to kill them to get some good parts.  And keep doing these.  However, eventually you may get sick of them showing up, and you can get them to stop showing up.  Simply let one land as you drive away and that will be last one you ever encounter.  It will stay on the map for you to kill later, if you want, which will resume the periodic Invaders showing up from time to time.",1679700086,1692113752,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I liked this game a lot, and there are many things that this game does right, from the variety of blocks to play with to the rich personality of each of the corporations' NPC guides.

Sadly though, it has barely changed over the last few years. While it may look like TerraTech receives frequent patches and lots of attention from its caring developers (which is true), most of the changes consist of the addition of a few easy missions, some new blocks to bring parity between corporations*, and the usual bug fixes. However, none of these of a notable effect on how you will play the game differently. On top of that, the game's age is very apparent in the performance. Even on a mid-range system, the FPS tanks whenever you get a single large or several medium sized crafts loaded. 

* Personally, I dislike how each corporation essentially has the same blocks and functions as each other. Apart from weight and block health differences, this removes the need to choose between corporations when outfitting your craft. If every corporation has the same offerings, it severely restricts the depth of building and makes the differences in each corporation minute.


I remember being excited looking at the original roadmap for this game posted many years ago. It's pretty unfortunate that almost all of the features have been scrapped or otherwise not implemented yet. Having said all this, it's still not a bad game; there's plenty to do and enjoy, and even more can be found in the mods people develop. Just don't expect anymore than what's already in the game.
Here's hoping that TerraTech Worlds can succeed where this game failed.",1542523049,1691721190,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For other players, however, the game doesn't update correctly and the host can be seen teleporting around despite not moving. Furthermore, enemies don't show their actual correct positions and teleport to the correct position occasionally. It's completely unplayable now. Co-op went from (sort of) boring to impossible to play. I am very disappointed.

When Co-op (with crafting) came out: As promised, immediately changing my review to positive now! Huge thanks to the devs for finally listening to the community and giving us what we have always wanted.

Original: I love this game to bits, but the refusal to introduce the crafting and factory mechanics into co-op is very frustrating. The crafting and manufacturing is a HUGE part of the game, and for it to just simply be removed from co-op puts a bad taste in my mouth, so to speak. That's the only reason I'm giving a negative review. The co-op gets old very fast as it is just a mission simulator. Sure you could argue to just play singleplayer, but it's not as fun as the ""nerfed"" co-op even though SP has the crafting mechanics.",1682692155,1690514040,False,0,0,0.523809552192687988,13,True,False,False

Whether you want to play a Lego styled sandbox game, exiting adventure and discovery game, or to create a prospector empire, Terra Tech has it all. With tons of blocks, loads of missions and an infinite world, it's hard to find yourself bored with this game. As there is multiple ways to get blocks in this game, there is many different play styles : crafting, adventuring, annihilating; the choice is yours. There may be the occasional bug or issue but they are not at all very common. The fact that this game is getting many updates past early access is awesome. The DLC is well worth it, and the game itself is a good price. With the new addition of a much better multiplayer mode then before, Terra Tech is now a blast with friends too. I definitely recommend this game, and I think that the many pros out way the small amount of cons.

I wanted to share the experience I had with a friend but was Severely Disappointed due to the game disallowing blocks I wanted to use and requiring me to be in range of him like seriously its 2023 the average computer can handle loading/unloading chunks.

The game in general is smooth on both of the systems I used to run it.

In singleplayer there are loads of missions to increase your standing to unlock blocks with the unlocks you can then gather resources and craft those blocks OR you can buy them from shop terminals OR find the blocks off a bot you destroyed.

In multiplayer the mission list is reduced, you have to stay close to the host like really close not due to the computer due to a barrier on the map and you HAVE to buy anything you unlock OR find it off a bot you destroy.

Edit: I would be willing to change my review if co-op / multiplayer improved

Newest Edit: The game does have multiplayer improved slightly the biggest problem with this game is that if you want to play multiplayer dont even bother if you want to explore only buy it as a singleplayer game you are tethered to the host making it impossible to play seperate but together.",1684456727,1689623788,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

I dont know if its spawn percents that changed or what, but, each of the missions now feels like it could be challenging, but it is doable with some effort.

--- Old Review below, for posterity ---
game used to be good. or at least, fun. These days, the progression is way off the mark. You'll get hit with missions with surprise enemies with end game near god mode weapons, when you haven't even been introduced to the military corp that supplies those weapons. this happens multiple times throughout the campaign, and its absolutely infuriating to be destroyed with absolutely no recourse, time and time again. the game is practically teaching you not trust the in built progression mechanics.",1628404570,1687322998,True,0,0,0.484813094139099121,0,True,False,False

There will always be new things added because the developers are so active. It is kind of like TrailMakers mixed with MineCraft. The colored blocks in the special ""cooperation"" make it so that you can add decorations and spice up your tech a little.

When I stoped playing Hawkeye had only just come out and now there's better future base building and much more. I honestly cannot express in words how good this game is. If you were a fan of Robocraft you'd certainly feel at home. However, don't go in thinking that this is Robocraft under a new name because it really isn't nearly as comparable to Robocraft as you'd think. I started playing this game because it was similar to Robocraft, however it has, grown out of Robocrafts shadow and has established itself in not just my heart but thousands of dedicated fans and truly allows you to express yourself while destroying enemies.

Pros:
- Very active community and developer work
- Quite polished and very good looking
- Very large amount of options to create (and destroy) things creatively and simply, from rather straight forward mass destruction machines, to mining operations to get money and manufacture parts
- Quite enjoyable (although somewhat steep) learning path
- Several types of different quests like combat, search over an area, races and obstacle courses, resource extraction assignments 
- *gun walls*
- Several different types of weaponry, including cannons, light repeater guns, lasers, railguns, missiles, mortars, melee weapons and also bombs
- Varied biomes containing different types of materials to sell and to manufacture
- Several faction focused blocks with both general and specialized use, such as lighter blocks, heavily armored blocks, faster and small wheels, BIG wheels, wings for fliers, chopper blades, gyroscopes, and so on
- much more

cons: 
- Can get somewhat buggy due to physics and flying blocks from resources and blowing up enemies
- Possibly confusing when you start making gigantic machines, making building them a pain
- Somewhat annoying shield and regen bubble functionalities, being that they have fixed sizes and are constantly active, meaning that your batteries are constantly draining, and somewhat hard to position when it comes to big machines
- Learning curve can be steep
- Anchors sometimes refuse to... well... anchor, especially when you have a big build and uneven terrain
- Somewhat convoluted manufacturing mechanics (personal opinion, and dont even know how it could be different, it just feels off)
- Terrain can be very difficult to pass by, with very intense and sudden elevations making it hard to pass through without fliers or very strong boosters

In general, its a very worthwhile and fun game, and would reccomend every sandbox builder lover to try it out, if the chance is given ofc

With more powerful hardware capable of running massive worlds in real time, I'm always surprised at how restrictive the larger games feel. We tend to think of player choice in terms of two dialogue options that functionally make very little difference to the outcomes. Not the case here with TerraTech!

Here you get a real taste of freedom and choice in a game. with the exception of some of the missions that are meant to guide you through learning new blocks, you can approach the whole world however you like with your computer legos (uncapitalized as I feel it deserves to be a regular noun by now). Want to build a behemoth and roll over any obstacle in your way? Go for it. Want to slam every thruster available onto every surface and test the game's maximum speed? No one's stopping you. Want to strap on enough ordinance to end an entire nation in a single volley? No war crime laws here. Want to build a super efficient factory line and mining operation? You already know!

If there's any downside, it's that I also play other very open games and I have to compare TerraTech to them. In Subnautica, there's an overarching goal that drives a lot of your decision making in terms of resource use and designs. Here resources are infinite and goals are very short term. It's a bit too much sandbox, and not enough jungle gym (structured climbing). It was interesting in Subnautica that knowing you'd leave everything behind, somehow you became more attached to it. Also in TerraTech, on top of infinite resources, you can bag of holding store all your blocks and blueprints; so it's hard to value anything you've gained.

However, as an introduction to more true freedom building games, TerraTech is practically perfect. It's definitely a game I'd buy to keep in my collection to pass on to my kids some day. So what kind of drink would I compare it to? I'd say it's more like a starter brewing kit.

Edit: it has come to my attention that crafting 
(and hopefully most manufacturing blocks) will be coming to multiplayer with the next update around July 10. This makes the text below kinda obsolete but hopefully the update fixes all my annoyances about coop campaign and creative
Still amazing single player and hopefully amazing multiplayer.

(Old)The PvP is fine i never played it. And coop creative can be fun. But the removal/restriction of manufacturing blocks along don't allow you to make/ design moneymaking bases and often you cant spawn your single player techs because you have a single restricted block in the save. You also have to stay in a area around the other players which gets very annoying. Coop campaign is disappointing. No manufacturing blocks mean no selling bases which means that money is hard to get. You also still have to stay by your friend and cant explore away from each other. The block pickup mechanic in Coop creative and campaign should be replaced with the single player version of the inventory system.

Multiplayer I have not played a lot but playing it shows you just how amazing the building in the game can be with each car you can see that the building is only limited by you and how many pieces you have. Now Cons, well you cannot mass select your parts, so when you build you have to do 1 at a time, and if you want to move a section of your car up or down you have to do it 1 at a time which takes more time. There is also no way to lock parts to a car so if you grab a piece that holds a lot of others they all will fall off and you will have to rebuild. but you can save whole car builds so that is a big help. The next con is there is no auto-save so make sure to save or you can lose hours of work building and playing. There has also been some artifacting around the stores where you buy car parts and a couple of bugs that are not huge just visual bugs. I say for the price and the amount of building that game can be comparable to -space Engineers- I say this because of how much you can build and there are ways to build bases also but this game is still getting updated 5/13/23 so we can expect more content to come.

The game was pretty fucking intense in my first 17 hours. I was only concerned with fighting other enemy techs, upgrading mine and enjoying the game's manufacturing part. The gameplay cycle of battling and evolving was great, with the addition of missions (which looked great, but got annoying fast). It had me hooked so bad that I couldn't stop playing the game to sleep. There's a lot of content to explore and the ability to create your own tech, but I found the game extremely easy. Every enemy was dead in one shot, but at the same time, I didn't like seeing my tech being destroyed, so I can't think of a way to balance it. In the late game, there wasn't much to do, so I started exploring the community content. There were some reskins and a lot of community buildings, so I started testing some and found out that airplanes are such a cool thing to control in this game. It made me spend another hour in the game before finally closing it. It's a great game to spend a few hours on, but I don't feel like I'm going to play it anytime soon

The core game loop is engaging, and it has a lot of creative potential if you're into that. The central mechanics are tactile and fun in a way that keeps you engaged for a good long while. The building is stellar, and even just driving and flying around can be fun. The combat is overly simplistic, however. 

If TerraTech is guilty of anything it's wasted potential. Its mechanics and systems are building up to a pinnacle that's not there. Its world is uniform and sterile, and there's nothing like long-term goals. 

The base building that turns out to almost never be necessary,  the simplistic combat, and a number of other features suggest that TerraTech really, really wishes it was a hybrid RTS. It just feels like its ultimate design goal is something it currently isn't, and likely never will be, and that's a shame.

Still, has a fair bit going for it. Definitely a solid few evenings fun if you're into vehicle builders, and the combat/salvage/combat loop is rock solid here.

I know they cant add crafting like they have in singleplayer because of some code spaghetti, but like comeon atleast make it so people can make their own servers and play without that godamn border. It isnt so bad when you use slower vehicles but when you unlock venture and other fast vehicles this is a huge limitation. And they could add another way of earning money for coop like having to rebuld your vehicle every single time it get demolished because you dont have the money to pay for the parts is just a pain. Since crafting isnt in the multiplayer atleast make the missions more profitable or add something else people can earn money from. I think that there are a lot of small changes they could do to better this game and i know the fact that their code is a nightmare doesnt help but comeon there must be something they can do to improve the game.

But then again this game is only like 20 bucks or something and i have played it for like 40 hours and had a great time so even with all of my complains il give this a positive review.

Build 30 techs that do different things:  Check
Create self-feeding bases that can make you money while you AFK:  Check
Work on your ""aeroplanes"", jets, tanks, massive war machines, etc.  But, can you use them?  No.  

Here's a specific build you need for this specific mission that you have to pay BB coins for.  Seriously?  What if I want to use my own?  SOmetimes you can, but usually just for the racing stuff.   If you want to make a build that can climb icy mountain?  Forget it.  ""Looks like you missed a checkpoint""  or ""looks like you slid right out of bounds"" when you're direcly on the path.  Have a tall mech you're using for Hubbl missions?  Sorry, that's not allowed.  Too close to the upper bounds....  Want to use your super hovercraft that you built to be VERY stable and easy to fly?  No, sorry.. it has to fit through these small hoops.  Want to make anti-grav easier (it's a joke and the developers know it) by making your own stable build a million and a half ways you've engineered it to work well?  No, sorry... it has to be able to go through these small hoops and only in this way.... Want to use your super duty tech that goes over 200KPH for racing?  Nope, has to be a specific size and you can't touch the sides of the road or you get disqualified.  Want to use your painstakingly created jet for missions?  Only if it has specific weapons and they can't be lock-on or anything.

I mean, for a game that touts its creativity and sandbox-like approach to building, it's very restrictive when it comes to missions you literally HAVE to get through in order to get to the later game material.  Things like icy mountain, time trials, hovercraft flying, Anti-grav timed racing, etc... are beyond annoying and usually bugged to one degree or another. 

I did icy mountain on a small tech I built specifically for it.  Nope.  Glitched every single time and that's a mission you DO NOT want to do more than once.  Tried it with 3 different techs and different VERSIONS of the same tech...  ""looks like you missed a checkpoint"".  No, no I really didn't.  Sadly this game is still buggy after how many years?

This is a great game if you just want to mess around in the sandbox mode, but doing the missions and trying to progress is a joke.  Don't bother.  Also, if you want to make really big, involved self-automated bases that mine, refine, sell, etc...  be prepared to climb into the UFC ring with the camera.  It's... beyond frustrating since you can't actually CENTER the camera over your base.  You have to work with zooming in and out from your tech.  Which.. is a mind-blowing failure in terms of a game that centers around BUILDING THINGS.

It's a sad day when you can spend almost 100 hours in a game and then realize it was for nothing when you get to the later missions and see that nothing you created can be used.  Normally I would look at someone wiht 70+ hours in a game that leaves a negative review and think ""they're salty about something and they obviously love the game"", but not in this case.  In this case I had fun right up until I tried to ""play the game"".",1683095620,1683096977,False,8,0,0.601302683353424072,0,True,False,False

The first and most glaring one is actually building your vehicles. For a game centred on the building aspect, it's unforgivable how poor the interface for building actually is. While the camera is decent, I find myself constantly fighting with actually placing blocks in the correct positions, and more importantly, rotating a block to the correct position. Blocks become pretty varied eventually, with many attachment points, and the only way to change orientation is by cycling 'backward' or 'forward' through what the game considers acceptable options, and this list often does not contain the option you actually need (despite it being a valid option) and you only find this out after having arbitrarily rotated the damn piece 150 times. 


Then there's actually getting the blocks. Sadly, many blocks seem to barely show up in shops or enemy drops, leading you to need to harvest resources and craft blocks if you want particular ones. Which is where the second issue starts. 

Harvesting is decent enough but crafting is incredibly awkwardly designed and above that, it's a buggy mess, which often causes endless loops of resources that don't get taken in by refineries, fabricators that stop producing their block on repeat despite abundance of resources, or just jobs for components not getting scheduled at all.

Also, you can forget about making mining outposts since rendering stops for anything further than 500 m away from the player, so miners  that you leave in a location basically do nothing unless you actually stay very close to it, completely defeating their point. 

Finally, the player is given basically no information on anything. All blocks only get a generic description (often gratingly tongue-in-cheek) and nothing else. No weight, no health, no attack strength for weapons, no capacity for batteries, nothing. You can only find this stuff out through trial and error.

I want to like it, the idea is good, and I did have some fun with it, but the execution gets frustrating pretty soon.",1683049266,1683058085,False,7,0,0.539540946483612061,0,True,False,False

While it's not perfect it is simple and enjoyable compared to the other games in the market right now. It's good and it's cheap with only the R&D labs i deem as necessary DLC the rest are for skins. and R&D labs is essentially a sandbox that you don't really need. It's cheap so buy it, if it's too expensive then get in on sale.

[h1] CONS: [/h1]

- Parts rotation is dumb: just right right-click it and hope it will be in the position you want. You can place additional blocks around it to ""block"" the other positions, but yeah it's just infuriating have a system were you can select which axis to turn it.

- Story/parts progression: In order to progress you need to do missions, these are provided by those station things (that I forgot the name of) well all in all it's fine, but if you spam missions on one of those stations at a certain point no new story missions will appear and you need to go to a far away station to progress. it's just annoying, hop in your speedy jet and find a far away station to be your next base.

- Poor optimization: I'm lagging from a game that looks less than roblox (lol) but really I'm on a 720p windowed on Fast setting and I'm still getting FPS drops. I can run GTA V on high 1080p @60fps so idk.

- Can't replay finished missions: Good because you can progress, Bad because you can't do them again. Missions that add extra stuff in maps like half-pipes and ramps will disappear. Sucks because some of them are cool and fun, but you can't do them again unless you restart a new game.

- HE is too powerful nerfing them neuters their power: The Cruise ""DOOM"" Missile will absolutely destroy everything from other techs to your own techs. Due to how HE works it can destroy blocks deep within your tech even if you spam other blocks in front of them. But nerfing them (with a mod Nerf explosions i think) absolutely makes them useless it prolongs the battle, which is actually fun but it can be annoying as it takes too long. There's no in between, I still use the mod btw.

-Varying factions with different aesthetics: Hawkeye is full black, GSO looks generic, Geocorp is all yellow. It is fine if you'll make a tech from one faction only. But some parts are so useful that it's difficult to do so. Hence you'll have a black armor with yellow tracks and white guns, not good to look at. There are skins but it is rather limited. Thankfully there are mods for skins.

[h1] PROS: [/h1]

- Simple creation: Drag and drop, while parts are limited with their connection surfaces, there are a lot of them with specific purpose in varying factions. Making a helicopter is usually hard in most games like this, but here it is easier. Still complex and needs to balance it properly but with that one Better Future part that can hold it in place makes it easier to fly. I am a human with a monkey brain I approve.

- Virtually endless map: If you want to make a base but not found the perfect place for it you can just keep going and find that perfect valley for you.

- Bigger is not better: while being big brings a lot of things in the table, a small tech can just hide beneath you and destroy you if given enough time, and you'll lose all that time and creds you spent on it. YOU can do this to bigger techs as well. Shield stops most bullets/shells and missile explode on impact, but HE can penetrate it and do damage AOE style. And energy drops fast if you don't pay attention to it.

- Fun mindless grind: Create a giant tech with one purpose, to split the world in half. While there's no terraforming you can clear forest worth of trees to reap world ending profits. You can alaso make a portable refinery so you can just go around and destroy trees and send it to orbit while moving. It lags a lot though :(.

-Mod support: Base game too limited for you? or is it too boring? don't worry you can spice it up with mods you can even add water.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]
A great game to mindlessly grind, there are missions and in the beginning parts and creds are limited. But given enough time and effort you can be a multi millionaire spend all of it in one tech. Only to all of it be destroyed because you run out of energy for your shields lol. You can be creative and make a mobile bunker with a fully working refinery, make a land battleship, or a floating fortress. Heck I've spent 2 hours making a quintuple copter that looks like a drop ship, fully armored of course with guns and missiles out the ass. AND the best thing it functions like an actual heli thankful to that one better future tech. Buy it I highly recommend, get it on sale if you want the other DLCs. Oh and the game is fully released AND their still updating it in the beta, absolutely chads compared to the other indie games studios.

P.S. I think there was an update and so the game broke lol. My mods are not updated I think and I should wait before opening this game again. Cheers to those mod creators.",1682052573,1682053197,True,25,0,0.757999777793884277,0,True,False,False

After over 500 hours in this game, I can thoroughly not recommend it with full confidence. I've been quite active in the community for a very long time, and I think I have a solid understanding of the fundamental issues with this game and more it's development.

The game is just broke as shit. They push it as a co-op game but multiplayer is almost entirely a broken and buggy mess and also locks off almost everything that makes the game fun (mining, crafting, scrapping, any sort of manufacturing past literally just selling resource chunks). When multiplayer released, everyone kinda just assumed that it was gonna be one of those things that would be added further down the line, but clearly its just shelved, and multiplayer is gonna be a boring and empty husk. Considering literally every other vehicle building game has a great multiplayer system that is so much fun, there really is no reason to buy this game as it brings nothing to the table inherently. Its also awfully optimized and runs like shit when you have even a slightly large vehicle, mostly due to how the game is so spagetticoded.

The building system is also cancerous. Rotating blocks is done by pressing a SINGLE button over and over again until you get the right orientation which can take upwards of 30 seconds on blocks that have lots of different possible orientations, there is NO MIRROR MODE!!!!!!!!! which I do not even understand why it is still this way and considered acceptable, and in general all the systems are far too simple and lack depth and intrigue compared to other games.

Finally, this game is just a damn ghost town. I doubt many people will even read this because this game has so little traffic these days. Devs can't even bother to do actual content updates and instead push shitty paid DLC skin packs trying to hemorrhage off the community's goodwill. We haven't got an actual substantial content update in years that was not ""two new blocks and a mission that takes 15 minutes to beat"".

In conclusion, this game brings nearly nothing of depth to the vehicle building genre as a whole. It's a great game to get you started in the genre, but games like FTD are far more in-depth and fun in multiplayer, and games like Cosmoteer do the ""Intuitive building system that is actually quite in depth"" shtick far better. 

(Also, I really didn't want to mention this, but the TT devs are funded by a Chinese mega-corporation, and around the time they received investment they retconned much of the dialogue to involve ""subtle"" anti capitalist wisecracks. I really don't care, but seriously?)",1573444568,1681962652,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The Gist: 

So as an early access person, I enjoyed the game, I enjoyed it thoroughly.  The single player campaign is repetitive, somewhat boring. Multiplayer is always what makes or breaks a game. For a spell deathmatch had some good matches, Co-OP was OK, but you know, the last year or so... It's gotten dead.. Like really dead... Developers have failed to fix crucial issues in multiplayer, instead choosing to go for the low hanging fruit of DLC/New blocks.  The lack of any meaningful changes in Multiplayer has turned it into a Ghost Town (queue The Specials... This town, is coming like a ghost town) Check the number of hours I have in this game.. 

The details:

Let's start with Co-op.

The biggest issue with Co-Op is the lack of control a host has over the game.  It's like having rude guests over for dinner, and never being able to do anything about them.  They come in, eat all your food (use all your blocks) They decide what you have in the cupboard isn't good enough so then they steal your wallet, and spend all your money at the store.  They don't buy Eggs, milk, and flour.. No, they buy throat Lozenges (First GSO wheel) Finally, they put everything out on the lawn, and set it on fire (lose your blocks by dying)

It's super annoying.  All you can do is kick them, but they can rejoin.  There is no ban. 

Oh, and world border.  Someone can join and not move, holding you back from your next mission.

Deathmatch isn't a game of skill, it's a game of ""Who can dominate with the biggest tech?""  People will spawn, put blocks into inventory, die, rinse, repeat until they have enough blocks to build something unbeatable.  Then they'll just annihilate everyone else cart blanch. 

Finally, let's get to the Single Player campaign.  It's just not that good.  It's repetitive.  Crafting is optional  once you have autominers.

The game started off great, and 7 years is enough time for the authors to fix things that are broken in multiplayer.  There's other crafting games that have come along since then that sort of keep my interest, but I'm starting to get really bored of TerraTech.

Updated: 8/29/2016

3 months after my initial review, it's time for an update.

Stability issues have been worked out for the most part.  Once in a while I might get a crash, but the game politely asks me if I want to save and submit a bug report and lets me keep playing.

At the heart of it, this game is Mad Max meets Mechwarrior.   The gameplay reminds me of some older DOS games I used to play, and it's a genre that I haven't seen done right in a vehicle game in a while.    A lot of these games had fixed hardpoints, and fixed body types.  TerraTech's building system let's you build pretty much anything the wheels can support.  

You initially start out with what's called a ""Cab"".  You get a starter gun and some wheels, now you're off to rebuild your war machine.  Initially the game starts you off on small, equal opponents.  You pick their parts after defeating them, attatching them and increasing the firepower (and weight) of your vehicle.   Parts come from various manufacturers, each avaliable after leveling up.  

Eventually you find the singularity unit, and the store.  Now the real fun begins.  You mine some resources, and make enough to start building a base.  Drop your singularity by some destroyed enemy parts, and it sucks it into your inventory. (I like leading them back to it) The base blocks are very functional, and there is a pretty easy to use conveyor system for moving things to parts of your base.   Several blocks chained together can increase the value of your mined resources by refining them, then using the refined materials to make new blocks that you can sell.

Through refinement or purchase, you gain additional ""Ai"" units.  (Protip.. Use wheels that keep them slow.) Now you plop one of these on your first creation, and start working on a second, or you can just let the little Ai cabs run around your feet with their pew pew shots.  Your choice.

Good game design has a few elements.  It has to reward the player into playing the game correctly, and Terratech does.  At some point your best car will have slow wheels (so minerals don't drop) a battery to keep a shield and repair bubble charged, and some tractor blocks in a t shape with a generator in the middle.  This way you just have to mine the oil, or knock down a tree to keep your shields charged.  Now you can really start dishing out the damage.

*Pros*
Great concept based on an older genre.  Could easily be called ""The most flexible"" of this genre
Intuitive gameplay that leads a player towards playing the game right.  Great design.
Great physics and mechanics

*Wishlist*
 
There's a few elements of the game that I think can be improved:

SCU Unit: It's sort of a minor annoyance to have to move an SCU near parts.  Why not have 
each cab with a built in SCU unit?  As long as the cab stays parked for an extended period, it starts collecting parts.  Another side benefit?  Less parts that have to be drawn.

Infinite Deployment Consoles:  The deployment console should always be avaliable.  I usually buy a few before heading into a new area, but I do forget to once in a while.  It would be nice to always have them on hand.  I don't mind paying for them, it's just annoying to drive back to another deploy console to get another pocketful.

Flight:  I don't like the ""autoswitch"" between modes.   If I have shift held down, then for all intents and purposes I should be in flight mode.

Radar/Flight: I think the Flight radar needs to be more like a jet fighter HUD that gives me a little green ""Lock On"" triangle overlayed in my viewfield.  When I'm trying to strafe units, the current radar doesn't help me much.

Multiple Unit selection:  Would love to be able to select multiple units/cabs the way you do in most RTS's. 

Unit right click context actions:  If I right click a blank area of a map in RTS games, the AI assumes I mean, ""Move to this point""  If I have a harvesting unit and right click on a resource, most RTS's know to ""Harvest"" and if I right click an enemy, it knows to ""Attack""

Unit grouping: Assign unit to a group

Hotkeys Hotkeys Hotkeys:  
Ctrl-a (Select all visible units) 
Left Click + Ctrl (add unit to selection) 
Ctrl-Z Undo
Ctrl + 0-9 = assign selected to group
Ctrl + H = Selected Harvest nearest
Ctrl + G = Selected Attack nearest

You get the idea.

Conclusion:  This is one of those early access games where the developers are listening, and coming through on their promises.  I would support this studios next endeavor after Terratech.   If they can ever make this work multiplayer, it's going to be amazing.  Get it now while it's cheap.

Players can customize and upgrade their vehicles with a variety of weapons, tools, and modules, allowing for a tailored game play experience. The game's crafting system is also deep and intuitive, with a variety of resources and components to discover and utilize. one potential downside of TerraTech is its lack of direction. The game can be overwhelming for new players, with little guidance on how to progress or what goals to pursue. Additionally, the game's pacing can be slow at times, with long periods of resource gathering and building required to progress. TerraTech is a unique and enjoyable sandbox game with impressive customization and mechanics.",1680217252,1680217252,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

it's like playing Legos, but in a free roam world

Really easy to learn, self explanatory, 
I would recommend playing with a controller, specially if you build a flying vehicle.

It's a relaxing build em up and shoot em up type game, with random AI bots that spawn as you complete quests for the different factions, and each faction has their own special blocks and parts which can be mixed around.
There's a bit of factory type mining and manufacturing to earn in game currency to buy blocks from the little kiosks scattered around the map, or craft your own from the resources.

It plays like another free roam battle bot game, but with the ability to create little mobile bases, and turrets or make an AI buddy that follows and guards your back.

The multiplayer Co-op is especially fun as you and friends share the resources and explore the map together.

10/10 would recommend if you enjoy building and battling little robots.",1680042749,1680042749,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Then you get into base building, making factories, turrets, different vehicles for different missions, unlock new stuff.  The missions are fun as well. Building vehicles and factories is quite convenient, there is CTRL+Z.Minor cons:   - Collecting blocks becomes annoying, even with sucky things and magnets.   - Game does become too easy when you know what blocks to use.   - Not enough incentive to explore the world, maybe distance from center based difficulty could help. - I would prefer bubbles to be more transparent.   - It is annoying when your tech looses a block but you don't know which one, adds a lot of micromanagement.

Maybe you get overwhelmed with all the blocks that are in this game, because they have added so much since the early days. Another problem is you get for example fly-blocks before you even get the quest ""learn to fly"" so there is no real linearity and the real story missions you have to do always make you drive 5 km. You also can get stuck with those filler quests like ""hunt down enemies"" if you don't move your home trading station from time to time. 

Considering the above listed problems I would still recommend the game to anyone who likes to play a game where you build your own vehicle and fight against others (just AI in Campaign). Just switch it up from time to time, try to craft your blocks and not buy them for example and don't only do quests. They are there for progress and if you want to progress through the ranks.

2023 edit: 5 years later the game still isnt finished and now they have a ""prospectors edition"". Total scam.",1434189856,1677094234,False,2,1,0.48981669545173645,2,True,False,False

The creativity involved makes it so much fun. I do think they should make the price $20 instead, but other then that it's a very enticing game. The graphics are some-what simplistic, but like other games that aren't graphic focused such as Minecraft, it doesn't need RTX or anything like that to add to it. The gameplay like I had mentioned earlier is very creative and is much fun to mess around with and build either really stupid creations or really cool and amazing vehicles. One of the only downsides i can think of is that they don't have big updates very often, but when you think about it you can understand why. The other downside is the multiplayer it needs a lot of work too many bad things with it I would love to play this with my friends but needs more love

Highly recommended. Fliers, hovercraft, VTOLs and anything in between can be built together using attractive themed blocks from different factions.

There's a sandbox mode to have fun with, or you can play through a simple but varied enough freeroam campaign with various side missions to introduce you to the factions, unlock blocks and create bigger and more elaborate machines.

SINGLE PLAYER: the world is huge, you have constant quests to do and a lot of them bring something new to the table, ""unlimited"" possibilites when it comes to building. i love building the perfect factroy just to 5 sec later hop into a plane and kill everything in my path and then slam into a tree.
MULTIPLAYER: ngl it's a bit worse it's basically like single player but with friends only problem being the multiplayer barrier. the game has a 700m or so barrier that stops players from getting too far away from eachother but personally i don't like it at all, it's very limiting and instead of letting friends do their own things and still have fun together the game forces you to stay close not allowing you to spread out and do your own things. in my opinion there should be an option to turn the barrier off cuz it kinda ruins multi since if you wanna build a factory or a base when your friends want to explore you're stuck cuz they can't go anywhere without you or if you got a friend who build a tech for 6 years you can't do anything in the meantime cuz you're stuck in the barrier.

Craftier Business II
I already had the scrapper. So when Crafty Mike said attach the scrapper, the highlighted one didn't work any, not even where it's supposed to be. So I got the one from my inventory and IT worked. But when it came to scrapping blocks, it could scrap them but not add mission progress. After realising I was stuck I decided to cancel the mission but when I did both the scrapper from MY inventory that I attached and the highlighted scrapper both disappeared. I didn't get the bug fix notification.

Overall. It is a fantastic game with great capabilities.
I personally am a great fan of the creative mode option.

Especially, when you can create tanks that can take care of other tanks in but a minute flat, and tanks similar of size in but 5 minutes orso when all is said and prepped.

Would love to see more content being added in over time, Like new ideas of vehicle movement
(perhaps spider / crab legs).

Couldn't get it to work but it was fun building and maybe in creative it would be a lot more enjoyable and more content but at least for the base/main focus on the game is terrible. Attacking is pointless since you only lose and never gain enough too repair. And the largest issue with this is you can't spawn saved builds ""snapshots"" cannot be payed or spawned by your money. No matter how rich you are, you can't use the money to spawn snaps that use missing blocks. It makes the whole system for me, completely useless and irritating that such a simple feature would at least make the game less of a pain to play. P2P? No. it wouldn’t break the game, it already tells you the cost so it seems like they missed the plot or can’t spell “Value: ” It's a waste of time mostly. The wheels can’t think to no matter and so the size slows down the wheels overall or they have a very low heavy-weight resistance to push on and move to the side. This means that when you have a lot of stuff on your car (that will build tension or whatever the vehicle word is) you won't go fast! Or be that flexible to be honest…
Returned and nothing changed.
I stopped playing a long time ago for the same problem but now it feels worse. Maybe I just don’t understand why we are transformers with words and eat wood for dinner and some have windows it seems more terrifying than any behind the scenes of any kid movie. Like Toy Story about a kid who doesn’t know his toys are alive and probably doing messed up things or Wall-E the movie about humans eating themselves for food. Sorry for the tangent. But performance is the second worst part of this game and third is of course the graphics. Just the most under-developed indie games of all time! Worse than 7D2D. At least in that game you can kill stuff without losing parts. But overall the game has nothing to give, a worthless experience. And everyone who ever played it stopped. It’s so boring that I rather play with picking hair off my arm for entertainment.

On balance, I can't recommend this game.  It's been ""ok"".  The beginning is fun, with a rather rapid upgrade journey into some beefy tanks that destroy the enemies in a satisfying way.  The mid-to-late game is a drag, and not fun at atll.

Main issues:
- crafting sucks.  It is a tedious, slow, frustrating exercise in trial-and-error that, when you finally get it working, takes ages to produce very little.  It's entirely skippable (and you should)
-base-building is like crafting, on a grander (and more frustrating) scale.  And, frankly, there's no reason to ever return to your base, as missions take you elsewhere in the map
- missions suck.  It's like WoW ""kill 10 boars"".  All the time.  
- tech design sucks.  Yes, I know, that's what the game is all about.  Building a tank (car with guns and optional armour and non-optional shields/repair and more guns) is easy enough, although there's no in-game info on what the block values are (weight, health, armour, etc) - you have to wiki everything.  Even damage is arbitrary, and the in-game scale does NOT align to the wiki damage for weapons.  But the real pain-in-the-ass is when you get into hovercrafts, or anti-grav, or planes, or god-help-you helicopters.  The build for these is just impossible with an amazing amount of (hours and hours of) trial and error to find out what works and what doesn't.  Basically, it nearly all doesn't.  Throw a couple of propellers together with some blocks and some flight adjustment (and some more flight adjustment, and some more flight adjustment), play with the weight distribution, add some more flight adjustment and you have something that flies...sideways...or goes upside down at launch...or doesn't turn...or turns like a ballet dancer on speed.  It is, frankly, far, FAR harder than it should be.
- story sucks.  There isn't one, basically.  There's a few campaign missions that are procedurally generated, except for a couple of short story arcs, none of which are anything other than simple ""go here kill this get that"" missions.
- reddit is dead for this game.  I don't think anyone plays it anymore.

At a certain point it becomes unplayable, I have about 2 hours into a new game to see if it was just my super battleship crashing the game. No any time i get a text from one of the job givers, or Interface with the terminal for new jobs or items, The game crashes. It seems to be a bug in the UI or interaction with the creations that have text to give you.

Also, hover that built just fine, stays in place just fine. 30 minutes later (no additional parts) the hover just start drifting an going some effing place that ISNT were i stopped.
 
----------------------------------Updated review as of 12/4/2022----------------------------------


Lets see, as far as sandbox builder/survival this is pretty casual. Not in a bad way just in a ""challenge your self"" kind of way. The mission Tutorials I think is ok, but the hover missions never stop with the tutorial missions an is pretty weak as of (6/16/2012) so if you want loads of free BB thats what to do.

The game has come really far in terms of when I first started playing when it was put onto steam. Over all the games development is pretty slow, but good.

Graphically: 3/5 its simple (not bad the low rez helps with multi-player im sure)
Story: 1/5 Vary simple, Land get work, get parts, build.
Endgame: 2/5 Once you get missiles/cannons its pretty easy to walk through everything.

Things I would change/add ammo. Bullets for the bang bang an batteries for the pew pew

Other then that I cant review the game any more, as its a work in progress.",1542268237,1670451070,False,0,0,0.425891399383544922,1,True,False,False

I will admit though, the learning curve can be a bit steep in some portions of it, but it is satisfying to finally make that plane or tank or airship that functions and is efficient.

2000 hours later, still pretty good, though has managed to pick up even more bugs than it has fixed

1000 more, it's held up modestly. Still has many of its old bugs but the team seems more promising towards what they have planned for the future. I really base most of my experience from multiplayer, which is an inherently buggy and under supported feature, but I still manage to have fun with it. I've also come to realize that this game really doesn't tell you much on what to do or how to do it, which lends to it being very open for the creative mind to be free and make what you want. It can feel somewhat limiting giving its block system, but at the same time there are such a wide variety of parts you can have that cubes will seem like foreign shapes in an instant. If you really want to get into this game for its pvp aspects, I may know a thing or two since basically all of my hours are dedicated to it, but overall it's not meant for this game - ""we"" (me and some others) make it work. One of the major issues is that this game isn't particularly well suited for very large builds given its lack of CPU multithreading (one core for attachment points one core for everything else) and that there aren't any natural threats within the larger scale, hence why I enjoy pvp since you can meet people who are both dangerous and are just as capable as you are. Granted, finding a good fight is extremely rare since most of the game's population is children. 

Anyways, building things or recreating real things is quite fun even if it isn't 100% accurate or what you wanted. In the end, you're left with something you made and can be proud of, which is certainly how I feel about most of my ships and whatnot I've posted to the workshop.",1583440189,1669933137,True,6,0,0.542419612407684326,0,True,False,False

Its a very good concept, Minecraft meets Factorio with giant robots. What else could you ask for? Build anything you want, see it working, fighting, or falling apart. This game offers a diverse pallete of building blocks, and it seems to be growing with updates. Speaking of which, although they are few and far between, and sometimes have contents of questionable quality, the game did improve over many years of its development, which makes me happy. Lets move to the ""questionable"" features.

The quest system seems unpolished, grindy, has a lot of unnecessary dialouge, and feels like it was made for an audience of 3 year olds. The main questline is somewhat boring and stale, while the random bounty missions are basically nothing different from killing a regularly spawned enemy. The side quests are fine, and sometimes interesting, but the dialouge is sloppy again.

The game allows you to build on the fly, quite literally, while youre driving, flying, or fighting, you can adjust any part of your machine however you want. This can be handy to pick up blocks that were damaged and fell off of you, but it can be annoying to accidentally pick up the 1 block that holds up half of your robot, and see it fall apart. Luckily, there is an undo button, and you can save a kind ""blueprint"" of your robot to summon it later, if you have the necessary blocks. Alternatively, you can enter a ""build mode"" which levitates your machine above the ground and lets you slowly move and turn around if you are in a sticky situation, without any other movement options for example.

This section is about my favorite part of the game, so it deserves to be quite a bit longer, be prepared. You can craft almost any block using fabricators, there is one for each faction, and of course they are blocks that can be placed on your robot as well, which can craft their corresponding blocks. You can only use them while anchored to the ground, so a stationary or a hybrid base is recommended. But dont be hasty, even if this is the most overpowered and fun part of the game, you still need to collect AND refine resources for the fabricators. Where do you find them? Everywhere. See that tree? You need it to make a wheel. That blue rock? Yeah, its needed for something too. Luckily, if you dont want to wander around the world collecting random resources, some of them have a mining node under them, which can give a substantial amount of resources, and the rest of the types can be bought in a shop (or un-crafted from blocks that you bought). Oh yeah, did i mention? If you dont like a block that just dropped from an enemy, you can use a scrapper, which is a similar block to the fabricator, but instead of crafting blocks, it eats them, and gives you back ALL the raw resources! But lets not get too far ahead. You got the resources, what now? You have to transport them to the fabricator, of course, with conveyors! This is where the Factorio part of the game comes. You have to smelt and refine some of the resources, which can get pretty complex if you want to do it fast, and in large amounts. You can store resources in resource silos, which connect to the conveyors, and will send their resources to the fabricators automatically, when they need them. Speaking of what they need, for some unknown reason, each recepie has to be unique. So, if there is a left variant of a block, and a right variant, you bet they will cost a different amount of resources. This is an oversight of whoever designed the recepie system, as, i assume, instead of assigning a cost to each block, they flipped it and associated a block to each cost instead, making it impossible to have blocks that cost the same amount of resources, because the fabricator requests its resources, waits for all of them to arrive, and checks what corresponds to that specific amount of resources, and spits that block out. Oh, and if you got unlucky and accidentally clicked on a wrong block, and cancelled it mid-crafting, any resources that the fabricator ate will be lost forever. You will not get them back, so you better hope that you have enough to craft whatever you want, or have a scrapper to un-do the unfortunate mistake. If you simply dont have enough resources, you can luckily un-anchor and spend as much time as you want grabbing them, as long as your fabricator does not get destroyed, or you dont accidentally disconnect it from your robot by grabbing it and throwing it away.

The soundtrack is nice, but sounds bland after a while. The sound quality overall is good, but its missing variations of the same sound, and can be repetitive after a while.

Multiplayer is a bit janky, although ive seen worse. Some features of the game are not available, but there is not much more to say about it.

There is a lot of glitches and unfinished things in this game. Some are harmless, others can be a big annoyance. And some, very rarely, become a part of the game, and be deemed a feature by the community and the developers, and i like this type of glitches. There has been an update to change the UI of the game completely, turning it into a ""mobile pay to win knock-off"" look. While i agree that change is necessary in order to make the game better, spending precious development time on a part of the game that was fine, and not even doing a good enough job at it - to the point where it takes less than half a dozen clicks to find the remains of the old UI - is uncalled for.

Lets get past its flaws and look at the good side. As my playtime suggests, this game can be fun, for a few hours, or maybe a few dozen hours, or perhaps a few hundred hours, or if you are really, really into building giant destroyer robots that consume the world and its resources, then, there is a chance, that it will suck you in for even a couple thousand hours.",1558636623,1669893372,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

but, its so good, i've bought it now for 3 other people!
it is long game supportive. Not a ton of games support the 'long term' sort of players. you can collect resources endlessly, build like lego's (and Technic lego's) endlessly.  Its good PG fun. all age ranges can get into this. Its kinda educational too. supports better logic thinking.

It (at this time) still has some code-issues relating to factory building, procedure assembly line setup. I hope the dev gets on fixing those...  but its been a REALLY long time so im not holding my breath.  But there are forums and a discord to talk to others about what to do if your factory assembly line isn't working right.  In my case usually connecting and tearing off refineries often solves my assembly line issues.  (and i don't even mean attaching(& detaching) them to a conveyor. literally just sticking them on some random un-important side or wall or something causes the code to re-check itself and get the 'kinks' out.  So keep that in mind all you big-brain builders *^-^*

Its good for you, good for your kids, good for relaxed-tension  hehe!  I just love it all around. and I've at this point played for 700+ hours!!!!  over the course of 4 years!!!!    so its great stuff!   

Not really hard.  and not overly complex, no real story, Well there is(ish), but its just silly... The initial hurdle is unlocking all the parts.  then its just your long game, of getting enough money or resources or parts.  to last you through all your creative mind can concoct! :D

just be careful letting too many stored-on-field resources build up in open air silos and collectors.  it runs physics for every single thing on the field!  soo  yeah convert those raw resources into blocks and put them in your dimensional storage instead!!    iv you've a rainbow of twirling little pieces suspended in tractor beams or piles... clean it up!!  compress it to blocks pronto!!  then the lag will go away.  *nods*

ok enough reading go play! :D

Ive been following and enjoying this game for many years now and its a great experience. The thing i wanted for the longest time was Multiplayer and we have it. ...Now we have a robust modding scene as well! had a great time last night playing this with a friend who never gets time to sit down and relax and he had such a great experience. of note we were approaching a trade shop when a power enemy dropped in right next to us. the enemy was fast, shielded, and equiped with powerful weapons we didnt yet have, and we had to run around the shop trying to harm it when two more enemies ran in to the scruff... both of us ultimately survived the encounter but it was touch and go there for a while and my friend even had to retreat to try and repair in them middle of the fight while i held aggro. We were playing with a solid connection even though im in the West Coast US and he is in the UK.

Great Game really! Clearly in the best place its ever been right now!

My only gripe was that i wish the Multiplayer Campaign mode allowed for FFA and FFA-Team setups so that hosting a dedicated server allowing for drop-in/drop-out connections with people who aren't necessarily in your in-group. this would open the game up to a larger audience and seeing where the game is at from a client perspective it looks like the next logical step forward.",1668180694,1668180694,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's a much better game with much more content than the early version I first played. Unimaginable numbers of different blocks and production, mining and factories too now. For a new player I'd say don't get discouraged because you lost a few blocks or died and lost some cool blocks because the game really throws a ton of blocks at you as you progress. You can loot defeated enemies, get rewards for completing quests, purchase and make blocks. Early game you can store blocks away from a store and without a black-hole block just by spawning in a simple saved vehicle (or dragging a cab out of your inventory), attaching looted blocks to it then despawning it again. You can store a lot of blocks just by doing that. The game-loop has you doing quests in order to upgrade your licences so you can purchase and manufacture cooler and more interesting blocks. It's a good system since it gradually introduces new and better blocks to you as you progress and you don't get too overwhelmed by the vast number of blocks there are in TerraTech.

Battling other techs is fun, missions keep it entertaining for a while, but once you try to expand your presence in the map and build bases you realise a few things:

-Bases/resource miners don't work if you're out of sight of the base, meaning you can't leave while ""auto"" miners collect resources, and crafting recipes bug out if you leave during construction
-during crafting, sometimes the crafting process gets confused and resources just pass by indefinitely instead of being taken into component factories
-music/sound effects cut out at times

From what I've seen in forums, and from lack of response to my emails, it seems like the developer has no intention of working with the community to improve or explain any of these things.

I have played through this game three separate times over the years now, but something about this most recent play-through that I just finished blew my away. The game feels so complete and oozing with content, and it is still receiving regular free updates. There is so much variety in quest types, techs you can build, enemy techs, etc. You can spend the time to design your own tech or go download something off of the Steam Workshop and plop it straight into your own game. 

The game never feels unfairly difficult, and you can always just reload a save if you get destroyed, but at the same time, the game never feels overly punishing to the point where I felt I needed to do that (but I still definitely did). ;)

Even at full price, I would definitely recommend this game if you enjoy sandbox, open world, exploration games where you can throw in a your own creativity and really make the environment your own. Loved this game.",1665723913,1665723913,True,12,1,0.668262779712677002,0,True,False,False

The game is pretty fun to play, so lets start with some of the major positives:
-- The main things that makes this game enjoyable for me is the large amounts of creativity you can fit into your techs from making them crazy strong, complex, or just make them look awesome. Personally I've spent lots of time in the creative mode building cool things that are mostly functional. And if your out if ideas, heading to the workshop and looking around can inspire you.
-- Base Building is another strong point. Making large crafting bases and armored bases is super fun, but this is hampered by the limited building size, but there are ways to get around it.

There are a lot more positives, but those are just two that I think are pretty key to enjoying the game.
Moving onto some of the problems, while being small I think the game has a lot more potential in these areas:

-- First of which is the building limit. I found it quite annoying when I wanted to make a mega base but I can see the reasoning behind it with people who might have performance issues with them.
-- Second is the quests. After doing most of the quests, they become very repetitive and boring, but that usually happens to most games after completing most of the game. But when this occurs is not at the end, but usually when your halfway maxing one of your many licences meaning you get to this point much quicker than you thought.
-- Lastly is while not being to much of a problem is exploration, While the biomes that you come across are all very cool, I think with a game that you can move around a lot in a openly infinite world can have much more to offer here, Though I know its hard to pull well as this game has done.

Those are just some of my personal thoughts and yeah, very much a 10/10 game if you love making unique vehicle's or tech's in this case.

Edit: Co-op needs to have crafting capabilities as this is a huge part of the campaign in my opinion, which it is currently lacking at the minute

One of the most fun aspects about this game is constructing vehicles. To start with, you only get a few pieces in limited quantity. As you defeat other vehicles, you can add their pieces to your vehicle. Once you start accumulating more & more pieces, you'll have the ability to construct just about any land or air-based vehicle you can think of. The only problem is when you start getting so many, then you have to be able to store everything. Fortunately, you can begin storing excess pieces at trading stations after a certain point. 

I tend to spend more time constructing vehicles than actually playing the missions. Part of the reason for this is that enemies will spawn in frequently. In most cases, I'll find an enemy that has a piece that I haven't obtained yet or additional pieces that I'll want to add to my inventory. As a result, I almost always have to travel back to a trading station to put my newly acquired pieces into my inventory. 

Some of the drawbacks to this game are:
1. They don't have other camera views. While you have some limited control of the camera by moving it around & zooming in & out to a small extent, you can't really get a sense of where you are dragging pieces to. It would be nice if they had a free camera that would move independently from the vehicle.

2.  Enemies spawn way too frequently. This makes it difficult getting your vehicle to the starting point of a mission with a full battery & repair / shield bubble. Sometimes, multiple enemies will spawn close to you.

3. There are no bodies of water to explore. Which means there are no boats or submarines. It would be awesome if a DLC could be created to add this in. How cool would it be to explore underwater areas or seek out islands?

If you like to use your imagination with your vehicle creations, then this game is for you. On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this game a 4.25.",1665421106,1665421106,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

boy oh boy, i have so much fun around in this game, look at my hours...i'm a real time-spender

the only thing that stayed from the older version is the way you start the basics XD! 
the rest of this are partened with missions and so-called ''tiers'' you need to achieve to get to more serious blocks, i like how they have implemented friendly techs aswell..protect them and learn more from them, especially CRAFY MIKE...
'' Kiddo Kiddo Kiddo'' i want more of those missions aswell, killing a bunch of techs tend to be boring after a while. also i think with new stuff we need more cool looking biomes aswell, the developers are active listening to their loyal comunity and thats a good thing, sometimes you are still recovering from the old invader and the new one is already happening, it goes so fast!!

i have a god-like computer with GTX 1070 graphic card and still the frame drops are visible at time to time
the biomes are never the same qua shape so one time you get a big landscape and the other time small, you get pretty occupied in this game with all the materials you can craft and so, i can't wait till they add more brands and stuff

all in all, i'm hyped for the next part of this game, and i hope it will bring loads of fun

thanks for this beautifull game, Payload Studios

The singleplayer is truly where the game is at, it has everything from crafting to building bases that auto mine for you to make you tons of BB which is the ingame currency. 

I will say, when i originally bought this game along side my GF, we had plans to play together throughout the campaign and do plenty of crafting. Sadly found out later that the multiplayer aspect of the game is much more limited. After finding out that this is a problem with the hard code within the game itself i can relate a bit to the developers, and do appreciate the work they did to make the multiplayer at least playable, albeit limited is better that not having it.

I would definitely recommend this game to an individual or even a couple, but i will say the singleplayer will give you the full experience. The building aspect of this game is honestly one of the best for its genre. Looking back on games i enjoyed such as ""Space Engineers"" got me into this genre and i cant get out. This games benefit is its relatively simple building, that can get complex if you want, but can make a perfectly overpowered Tech with a simple design such as a square box with rockets all over it. 

I will say one thing to the developers here, they should consider 1 more faction/corp that's entirely based around walkers. like the at-te walkers from SW or the AATs from SW, or some of the experimentals from Supreme Commander. Would make this game feel complete since its based around Mechs and vehicles through crafting and building, and i feel like there is definitely a hole there since it has just about everything else.

Thank you for reading all of this, I hope it helps you make a decision on rather you should buy it.",1663021598,1663021598,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

Despite it being fun, it is by the admission of the devs themselves flawed in a fundamental gameplay aspect (fabrication) which they will not fix; this leads to a watered-down multiplayer experience that you are not ever informed of on the Steam page, and must discover on your own after you and a friend have shelled out $50 for two copies of the game. Resource management and fabrication is a not insignificant draw of the single-player experience, and leads to a player being able to access technologies far beyond what they might be able to purchase in a similar amount of time, while allowing for multiple test-runs of a craft that isn't exactly up-to-snuff on your first run with it in case everything goes sideways. In multiplayer, the only way to get parts is either conquest or purchase, and selling any looted items takes an agonizingly long time (Approximately 40 minutes of constant clicking to empty my inventory of unneeded parts for desperately-needed cash). In single-player I could scrap those parts and recycle them into useful materials; in multiplayer I have no choice but to spend an hour or more clicking and waiting at a terminal.

Furthermore, even if you are able to get enough things you want in order to make a build you enjoy, you might not have the opportunity to construct it; the game has 0 building protections, meaning that if you are trying to build a new Tech without any AI guards nearby, you are likely to lose a significant fraction of rare, expensive parts from the build. While it can be satisfying to make a new Tech, it becomes tedious when you are constantly harassed by enemies whilst attempting to build something new. Creative mode is a thing; but I find that I enjoy having to build a new tech for the task at hand when a new issue arises, and the game sucks any fun out of the process when I've been working on a new design for all of 30 seconds and it gets lost to something I cannot hope to escape from.

Unless/until the game either properly explains to new players looking for a full-fat multiplayer experience that they will not be receiving one, or the devs actually incorporate the full host of single-player elements into multiplayer and fix the admitted issues with its mechanics, this review will remain negative.",1662004996,1662004996,False,5,0,0.565759420394897461,0,True,False,False

I honestly think that the story is lacking, but the creating your own path aspect of it is really appealing. Absolutely murdering lower level bots because you're using a flying plane with homing missiles is super fun, and it makes you feel like you did something the game didn't expect. Completely demolishing all of the huge guys with your huge guy also feels extremely fun. The only downside to this is that it does eventually get a bit boring. At a certain point it begins to feel like there's nowhere more to progress to.

TLDR: This game is really great to binge and play for like a week at a time, and then it's replayability is really great, when you get the urge for it.

Here's the list of annoyances:
1. The vehicles in the game can't traverse mined rocks because for some reason they chose to give them a collision mesh which jams up seemingly all types of wheel. Given the amount of mining in this game, this is particularly annoying.
2. There's no guidance to making a stable vehicle, no clear indicator of the weight of things, so you it's all just trial and error. Good luck designing an aircraft.
3. For some reason they gave the resources physics, which means that if you mine something it'll then immediately collide with your vehicle and flip/lift it.
4. There are lots of weapons and tools with different functions but there are no weapons groups. This would mean you'd have to make a dedicated mining vehicle for example, but you can't because enemies will attack constantly no-matter what.
5. Lazy enemy spawning mechanics mean that you have to engage in very easy combat constantly.
6. There are no well though through design constraints which means basically every vehicle in the game will end up being a ramp with guns on it (even the enemies).
7. There's a crafting system with a factorio-like factory building system, This sounds amazing but it's done so poorly that it can't  really be used. Factories are too complicated to bother with so you'll buy all the parts.
8. The building system is just bad, it's not enjoyable to build vehicles or factories. The random nodes on parts are more annoyance than limitation and if you try to make a base on uneven terrain (like all the terrain) then it's basically impossible.
9. There are too many kinds of resources in a game which has no proper method for dealing with them.
10. There's a weird ""anchor"" mechanic where your vehicle becomes a base, it makes no sense and again is too janky to use; good luck anchoring your vehicle on uneven terrain.
11. The guns all have auto-aim taking away much of the possible skill in combat, again encouraging a wall of guns rather than a real design.
12. Many of the weapons have ridiculous mechanics which might make for interesting enemies, but certainly aren't useful for the player, leading to lots of useless parts cluttering up the menus.
13. All the boss fights seem to encourage cheesing by out-ranging and other cheap tactics, there's no meaningful indication of difficulty or how well your wall of guns will work before you begin.
14. One of the core concepts of the game is the idea that you kill a vehicle and take its parts to build your own, however they've made that pretty tedious even with the black hole device, because it relies on the ""anchor"" mechanic which means even when you finally do anchor, it takes about 10 seconds to get all the parts which ruins the pace of the game.
15. You can't put parts in your inventory; you either need the previously mentioned black hole device with 10 second delay or you need to attach parts to an ""anchored"" block and then right click and put all the parts in your inventory. For a game about salvaging parts this is needlessly tedious.

There's definitely a good game in there somewhere, but this is now a £25 game and no loner in early access. In my opinion it's just not polished enough to consider a release-worthy game yet, needs more time in the oven and more focus on making the core game fun rather than doing the easier tasks like new parts, artwork or missions.",1453930200,1661252254,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

When you are required to do missions for extra parts (instead of being able to destroy other techs / buy them), it goes downhill.  I can understand a bit more challenge, but the way these missions work can be really annoying.  For the entirety of the game, you are encouraged to modify/build your tech to fit your play style, but then you get these missions that force you into incredibly cramped areas or vast open areas against invincible foes (supposed to flee).  The control dynamics can vary greatly depending on size and modules on your tech.

  Pros:
  * Base gameplay is easy to pick up and understand, yet has a sense of complexity and nuance. This makes 
     for a very satisfying gameplay loop.
  * Unique and interesting design, allows for the creation of any vehicle/craft using a wide array of voxel 
     blocks
  * Procedurally generated open world sandbox with a mission based system, which forms the foundation for 
     the game's main gameplay loop. Missions allow you to unlock new companies, or progress your status 
     within existing ones, in order to unlock new parts.
  Cons:
   * Sometimes, controls and movement can feel janky and unresponsive. However, this is often times a result 
      of an error within your build, since many factors such as, lift, weight, tire diameter, and weight distribution 
      all have a varying impact in the effectiveness of your build. Not exactly a con, but I definitely spent most 
      of my first few hours running into every rock and tree imaginable.
   * Rocks and Trees are a huge annoyance if you're using a large tech, since you either destroy the obstacle, 
      damaging yourself, or you stop dead in your tracks surrounded by 20 other rocks in the bottom of a tall 
      valley. In the future it would be cool to see dynamic tires, that function similarly to real life, or a larger  
      focus on suspension articulation, but both of those things are hard to program and not necessary for a 
      game of this style. Overall, I think that travel in this game is satisfying, and often a fluid and easy 
      experience with a good vehicle, however it could still be improved upon. 
   * Multiplayer is missing core gameplay features, yet is still highly functional, stable, and enjoyable while in 
      the multiplayer campaign.
   * AI is hilariously stupid at times, especially when the tech is on your team trying to Follow/Guard while 
      mobile. To solve this, I found that rooted defense turrets around a base was often the go to strategy, and 
      was very reliable.
      means that a part of this game, is basically unusable at times.
  Summary:
  In brief, I would like to talk about my overall thoughts and opinions on the game. However, note that I am 
  not fully finished with the game and the things that it has to offer. I believe that this game is a solid 8/10 , 
  and often impresses me with it's surprisingly good visuals, huge sandbox, and a multitude of other factors  
  that will keep you coming back for more. Although, there are moments where the game shows it's 
  weaknesses, they are far and few between, and I give major credit to Payload Studios and their team for 
  their dedication and creation of a very good product.

AI doesn't change, no manual aim, you can only fight ground creations, navigating is difficult due to the lack of a map, missions are boring and repetitive and just constantly tell you where to go or what to do, you cant make your own choices and the worst thing, automation is annoying because your creations will despawn if your too far away completely ruining the point of making multiple bases to farm multiple resources, thus forcing you to afk at each individual base to gather resources. Eventually enemies will spawn and destroy your base and your creation. Most characters in the campaign are boring and forgettable and the game lacks a story imo.

Game is pretty enjoyable for first few hours of single player, you have a pretty big amount of content. You can make a base, factory do quest, etc. 
Then you start to think... they added multiplayer and you want to play it with friend then you play with them for about 1-2 hours and never play this game again because lack of content in multiplayer.

PS. For the Developers... Please STOP adding items just fix or update multiplayer, okay?
I'm 100% sure if you make multiplayer playable or enjoyable you will get better reviews and more players(customers) for this game. Can you tell us if you at least think about doing something with multiplayer, okay?

It's got quite a bit of content, the variety of pieces and parts is huge, and you can build some really unique stuff! The artsyle is wonderful, and the crafting system is genuinely pleasing. I have a lot of good things to say about this game, even if crafting is STILL missing from co-op and updates are infrequent. There's plenty there already to make it fun!

This genre is filled with P2W garbage and always-online stuff, so I'm really, really happy to point out that the monetization here is PURELY cosmetic! There's workshop support, so you can get mods, player-made builds, and even skins, and there's procedural terrain, meaning you can travel for miles.

I love to make original builds and play around with the game's mechanics, it's overall quite fun and I rate it an 8/10!

However, I do want to point out the cons, which I don't think amass to much but I'll let you be the judge: The enemies start to become trivial after you layercake enough weapons, however if you let your guard down, they will eventually crack through your shielding if you don't pay attention to how much battery you've got left.

I think you start to encounter more powerful enemies the further you progress or the farther you travel, so I'm not sure how that works. The UI is great, but there are issues with the camera, bugs with the UI itself, and other things such as 1920x1080 support being awkward (not supported in the Unity startup window but being supported in-game? what), other small bugs like that which can get really annoying. Also, not being able to press 3 keys at once!

Despite no crafting in co-op and all these annoying little bugs that add up, I still love this game and I still absolutely recommend it. What makes that possible is this game's personality. You can tell the developers of this game genuinely love what they do and what they've made, it shows in the atmosphere, in their updates themselves (despite infrequency), and in the game overall. This game has personality, this game has variety, this game has funny big car go boom. It's great!

Thank you Payload Studios for making something that gives me hope for this P2W balance issue infested build-your-own-vehicle genre once more :>",1656044490,1656044490,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Despite the fact the game is fun I also think it is majorly flawed. I am not too sure why I enjoy the game as much as I do with how many problems it has but I would like to go over some of the problems in this review just so you know what you could be getting yourself into. 

Lets start with one of the biggest flaws to the game, difficulty. This game is not difficult AT ALL, and i would love for the devs to, at the very least, add more enemies to the game. As of right now the only challenge you will face is from the Hawkeye faction and the missions (they are rarely difficult but you can run into some really tough ones). Even by the time you run into Hawkeye there is a fair chance you have outpaced them and are already stronger than them. Most of the randomly spawning enemies are incredibly weak, so they are only ever a threat in the early game. 

That is another one of the major problems with terratech, there isn't much to the late game. Once you have all the factions unlocked you can easily pave through enemies like they are nothing, because they don't seem to scale. The only enemies that scale with your tech (at least to my knowledge) are the invasions which are player made techs that can occasionally drop down near you. Even when they are threatening you can kill them easily if you have heavy hitting weaponry or are just flying. The late game of terratech is mainly just building and testing vehicles, aka the same thing you could get in creative mode. There is never a major threat to you in this game past the mid game.

Going back to enemy techs, we have the enemy ai. There are only ground enemies (for the most part atleast, it is said in the wiki that there are flying enemies and they are just really rare but i have yet to see one for myself), because the devs just haven't made the ai work with planes. The ai try to use car mode when they can because they aren't built to fly. The lack of flying enemies is somewhat sad because i imagine they could add some much needed difficulty if given the right weapons.

I've been saying a lot of negative things about the game, and i haven't even gotten through all of it (the balancing for certain weapons is just sad, and co-op is a insult), so why am i giving the game a positive review? Honestly I'm not too sure, but the game is still fun. Even with the bad ai, garbage difficulty, and lack of late game content, it is still a fun game. I think its a mixture of simple, yet fun, combat along with the easy building that generally isn't too frustrating, or the memorable techs you meet during missions. I have a fun time playing this game and from time to time I still play it, and I just hope the devs make the game at least a little more interesting. 

This is the most effort I've put into a review (even if it is still a shit review), and the reason i put so much effort into it was because i really want people to know what problems this game has before they play, but i also want to say that it IS NOT a bad game (as long as you don't play co-op). Maybe the devs will fix some of the issues and maybe not, honestly I will still play the game either way.




Seriously though please add flying ai, i want to rage quit after getting shot by a plane with homing bombs or missiles.",1655760758,1655760758,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is a block based vehicle building and combat game, with a bunch of other mechanics like crafting, buying/selling, and missions.

[h1]The good:[/h1]
+ Great campaign mode, which offers a great deal of freedom. Think of it like Minecraft's survival mode.
+ Creative mode, build whatever your heart desires.
+ Tech snapshots (saving your vehicles) are great. Snapshots are cross-save, cross-game mode ways of transferring your builds from one place to anywhere else. It works with steganography, which is taking an image of your tech, then encoding your tech's data in the image itself. It's a really cool method, which also gives you a preview for everything.
+ Actively maintained and updated by its loving development studio.
+ Great community.
+ No paywalled content, only cosmetic skins and the R&D DLC, which is a very specialized testing environment (which, in my opinion, has lost most of its use with the advent of creative mode, because you mostly just build big stuff in there :P)
+ Balance is overall pretty good.
+ There is a great variety of blocks of all kinds.
+ You can build ground techs, flying techs, and even hover techs, and also bases.
+ The music is absolutely banger.
+ Good replayability.
+ Limited multiplayer support.
+ The block inventory system with SCUs, and how it was updated that you now always have access to it instead of only when you have an SCU placed somewhere. It's well implemented.
+ Each corporation (think of them as factions) is well defined, characteristic, and lovable.
+ Twitter integration for getting the techs of other people in your own game.
+ Workshop support for both skins, techs, saves, and mods! Of course, mods are not as straightforward to install as clicking the subscribe button on steam, but mods are never easy.

[h1]The depends-on-the-person-playing-the-game:[/h1]
~ Making money takes a little effort, you won't make enough money by passively killing enemies and doing missions.
~ Completely rebuilding your tech as you reach high enough grades with different corporations (tldr leveling up a bunch) could be potentially divisive (I personally enjoy it), but it won't happen all too often.
~ Lots of enemies, lots of fighting. Peace is not too easy to come across, but it's achievable.
~ Tooltips of blocks and missions contain some lore alongside tips on using specific blocks, but it's mostly just fluff. I recommend reading them.
~ Travel distances aren't short. You'll have to take your time preparing for, and during traveling.
~ Story missions (not repeatable ones) leave permanent changes in your world in the form of buildings, environments, etc. They are fairly spread out in case you don't want them, however this contributes to longer distances.
~ Tech archetypes. Combat techs are almost always a bunch of batteries, shields, and a front side full of guns. Miners are mostly drills with few guns and a lot of resource pads. Combining tech types is useful, but against a few particularly brutal purpose-built enemies, you're going to be at a huge disadvantage.
~ Enemies drop a lot of blocks. Picking them up is good, but a little tedious.
~ The AI is acceptable. It's not great, but it is not bad by any means.
~ The implementation of some things are funky, but that's a given with every game, really.
~ The newest corporation, Reticule Research, is not entirely finished.

[h1]The not good:[/h1]
- The very late game is partially dominated by who makes the first strike due to the large amount of firepower of high tier guns.
- The previous issue is exacerbated by the existence of a few particularly powerful weapons (namely the Megaton Cannon and missile launchers). These are relatively small weapons with long range and a nearly disproportionate amount of firepower for its small size. The number of enemy techs featuring these weapons have been cut back, but these weapons are still troublesome to encounter, and since your own tech is not limited in any way, you can plaster on as many of these weapons as you want.
- There are very few mid-game enemies. Almost all enemies are early game, endgame, or made for a challenge mode called sumo mode, which gives you a limited set of blocks to make a tech that can push or destroy an enemy made from the same stuff. These techs are slow, fairly large, and generally not well armoured, but most importantly, very same-y. When you fight these, Geocorp battle music plays (they have the largest hull blocks, and sumo techs use a bunch of those), so better get used to those 2 tracks. At least they are pretty good, but repetition and music doesn't mix too well.
- If you read this far, have a cookie
- Past the first two grades of GSO, battery power is basically your health: it keeps your repair and shield bubbles operational. If you run out of power, your tech is left undefended and unable to repair any damage it sustains, which leads to your blocks falling off (if you're lucky!), or getting obliterated.
- Adding onto the issue of battery power being mandatory for survival if you plan to fight, death is potentially pretty punishing. When you die, you have the option of rebuilding your previous tech from blocks in your inventory (buying blocks you don't have, which gets expensive very quickly as you get larger), taking control of one of your other techs in the vicinity, or if that's not an option, get a grade-specific GSO tech for free that's only really good for driving back to safety.
- Volatile blocks are very hard to acquire. You have to craft and buy the majority of the ones you get, because when you destroy the cabs (main block, if it dies the whole tech dies) of enemies, some of their blocks blow up, which in the case of volatile blocks, damages other blocks around it, and since these blocks tend to be placed near each other, it's rare that these kinds of blocks survive, especially in groups of more than 1.

[h1]Final thoughts and opinions:[/h1]
Don't let the negatives deter you from the game! They largely apply only to specific in-game scenarios, and most can be circumvented one way or another.
This game is a great deal of fun. How you make your tech decides everything about it: the square-cube law applies to mass and propulsion, which leads to larger techs always being much slower than teeny tiny speedsters. Once you take this into consideration, you also have to think about how much battery capacity you want to squeeze onto your tech. Batteries are vulnerable and heavy, but you must power your shields at all costs... Then you have to move your entire construction, regardless of size, through terrain. Are you gonna go on the ground, will you fly, or will you use a hover tech? Or make the decision of ""sod that, I'm downloading the water mod and making a submarine!""? All up to you! Go ahead and get the game, experiment, build a nice crafting base that can make anything, charge your tech in case you run out of power, and defend you! It's a static base, you can make it however you like!",1654970888,1654970888,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is very relaxing when building your techs and bases but also has a sense of suspense as you don't know when an enemy is going to creep up on you. The fighting aspect is fun and requires some skill as you have to build your tech so that you can effectively kill your enemies as quickly as possible.
The story is well paced and encourages a lot of travelling which stops you from staying in one place and pushes you to go out into unsafe areas, away from the comfort of your base, and test your skills.
The automation part of it is fun as it reduces the amount of manual refining and crafting that you have to do so you can focus on progressing in the story line.

Two things IMHO that can be addressed to make this game greater

- While fighting enemy techs (NPCs), they will kinda freeze / enter standby mode when you get out of range. It would be great if they can improve the AI so all NPCs that spawn on the map are always active regardless of how far the player is.

Rather than saying it's a ""combination of Lego Technic and Guns"",
I would say that it's a strange combination of Mindustry and Robotech.

If you haven't heard of either, don't worry -- TerraTech teaches you how it all works.
You build a small tech, kill small techs. Gather the blocks to grow, kill bigger techs.
It's a cycle that keeps you going. The Factorio-level of seratonin and dopamine from annihilating a tech that killed you ages ago is palpable.
And it's very, very tasty.

===   Why you should consider picking up this game or lingering around.   ===

[b]-Potential[/b]
   Terra Tech (TT) has MASSIVE potential! The devs interact with the community CONSTANTLY, and this interaction caused missions like Charlie Watchtower and the Reticule Research (RR) faction to come around and stay around, this is also why we have a form of multiplayer right now. This game is growing like an oak tree, not like a building, adapting constantly and can do so with extreme sensitivity, albeit slowly. The devs are also not afraid to experiment and do radical changes like the new type of missions like Charlie Watchtower and a new faction suggested and supported by the community; Reticule Research. This gives the game a lot of possibility for growing and is unlikely to stop for a very... very.. long time.

[b]-Extensive Mod Support.[/b]
   TT is a game that tries to be a lot of things, from mindless combat to organized base building. TerraTech covers so many categories it tends to lack in quality in many. Mod developers however are more than happy to fix those qualities, like the target prediction mod from TerraTech Mod Manager (TTMM) to help with the combat and for just more things to play with, custom block mods found in the workshop. (TTMM is for unofficial mods, the mods on the workshop are official mods supported by the developers directly).
    Payload Studios is very keen on increasing mod support even further in the hopes to have all types of blocks be supported with the official modding tools. You can expect mods to become a part of this game like with other mod heavy games like Stelaris and Forts RTS.

[b]-Great community.[/b]
   As an introvert and someone who is massively insecure, the fact I have began to participate heavily in this game's community in my eyes show it is a wondrous place. There may be only a few of us compared to other games, but we are all good people for the most part and it is because of this that I ever made this review.

[b]-Great developers.[/b]
   The devs of this game are amazing, they interact with the community whenever they can and even keep us posted, although this has lessened over the years. Don't ask why crafting isn't part of multiplayer, it has been answered 5,000 times so the team is a little run-down for direct interaction. We as a player base are given plenty of information about the game by the small dev team but be sure to search for the info yourself first before asking for information. I even interacted with the community to such an extent I was an unofficial community manager and I can say; over the years it has been very enduring to answer the same questions.

[b]-Growing with the game.[/b]
   TerraTech is likely to evolve in a similar fashion to Minecraft. With update after update after update after update, and eventually, a possible rework on some old parts to make them more refined and polished. As someone who joined this game years and years ago from Ssundee's first lets-play of TT, I am confidant in this and it has been quite a ride. I am looking forward to TT's future.
[hr][/hr]
[h1]=== What might deter you from buying this game. ===[/h1]

[b]-Performance demand.[/b]
   TT is a very performance intense game. Many attempts at helping this have been made with varying success but TT is still and will always be a performance intensive game. It is however a lot better than in the past. If you have a decent PC the game will run alright until you really do some big things, like building massive constructs and creating a boarder around your base with nothing but individually built turrets.

[b]-Too many niches.[/b] (Also is responsible for the game's potential.)
   TT tries to be many things, a combat, resource management, fleet building, base building, vehicle building, sandbox, free-roam, adventuring, and roll playing game. As you may expect, the amount of work done in each category had to be distributed throughout. Many areas are a bit low in quality, some more than others, because of this design choice.

[b]-Partially working multiplayer.[/b]
   Keeping this short: Multiplayer has massive limitations, the game was designed to be single player for its first 2 or so years, the multiplayer content is so limited it can be quantified. I would say about 50% of the game's total content is missing in multiplayer player and mainly because of crafting and base building not working on a server and requires essentially an overhaul and rework from the ground up to change this.

[b][u]-Limited Player Experience![/u][/b]
   [i]If I could make a 2nd review it would be nothing but about this. [b]If you are looking for a game you can play over and over again. [u]I HIGHLY discourage picking up TerraTech.[/u][/b][/i]
   Fun fact, after 1,600 hours I barely played this game. After 1,700 I outright retired and the last 194 hours have been gained over the course of [i]2 years[/i]. [b]There is no end game. There is no major goal to work towards, (Avorion is a good example of it done right). There is no access to more challenge for long-time players. There is no sustain of content (I am looking at you, Core Missions! [which are 1-time missions]).[/b] This is made worse by how the 1-time missions are entirely roll play, there are lots of them, are mandatory to complete, agonizing to travel to which makes base building meaningless in the early game, and [i]you can't speed up or skip the monolog of the mission[/i], having to wait a good 30 seconds or so before you can BEGIN the mission that will last 1 or 2 minutes and never play again within that game save.
   I completely ran out of things to do. Unofficial Mods can't help as they can't add custom missions or change the main experience. Official Mods can't help as they only add things, not improve core mechanics. There is no reason to build diligently even in creative mode when nothing will challenge even a poorly built creation and the things that do are [i][u]creative mode[/u] PvP[/i] and [i]Reticule Research core missions[/i] that you can only play once per save.
   I stopped playing because there was nothing to play with. The game is open world but it feels like the world is empty, baron, uninteresting, tedious, and dead. Nothing ever happens. It's like replaying the same day over and over and over again while the game acts like each replay is ""a new day"".

Very fun game for a casual game, but it has a severe lack of mechanical skill cap.
Very frustrating at some times due to the auto targeting system, making it nearly impossible to aim correctly.

It does have good game play and a good bit of player freedom and flexible creativity.  It looks aesthetically pleasing too.  Somethings become a bit too repetitive though.  Even as you progress and get better parts, there doesn't feel like there is any real mid or end game feel too it.  It is one thing for the game play progress to slow down, but something about how this goes is something other then grinedy, like even if you do get a new, bigger, more powerful gun, something feels off and lack luster.  It is too easy to get burned out on this game and any reply value melt away.

It feels like a game that is missing something and needs to over come a hurdle before it can become great.  I don't know what that is.  What ever it is, it is making the usual progression and grind seem... off and odd, making it feel weird and unrewarding after time goes by.  what ever is missing, it is having a bizarre effect in the later game that leaves a sense of ""meh,"" as you keep leaving up and building up.",1650415831,1650426345,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Enemy ai is dreadful, you can shoot them before they even activate due to range.  As mentioned even when good techs spawn they don't have their shields so alpha striking makes it cake.  I learned recently after buying the game for a friend that the crafting in MP is ditched and there's a tether, making it a rather bland MP campaign.

Various blocks force the player to think outside the box to every tech design.

However...
NEEDS MORE CAMPAIGN MISSIONS! Absolutely loved the missions with reticule research! Ghosts and tower destruction was the most fun I've had for about a week. Then, nothing much to do after all corporations were maxed out. ...Just sitting in my RR campaign dome base and engineering the heck out of anything I can think of with 20 million block unspent. Also, is it possible to use your own campaign worlds and invite other friends? Would like to play with other people in campaign. But, I also don't see an option to keep it private if I load my own.

Additional:
X - Doesn't run too well on 8GB ram laptop. Required resolution 1280/720 for 40fps (can't really help it)
O - Love the addition of new blocks. However, should add more at a time and include blocks exclusive to some of the missions, e.g. mission where you had to navigate through a maze with ghost RR vehicles (would like to see invisible technology).
O - Few bugs when I first downloaded over 3 years ago (haven't experienced any in the last two years).

Control air vehicles isn't possible with mouse -> to make matters worse if you turn to hard, you view isn't focussed anymore, meaning you have to use your 3 hand to center your vision; all in favor to pick up new blocks in the middle of the flight to put on your tech *sarcastic* :
Helicopter and Plans have to be balanced with center of gravity, center of thrust in mind to have them actually steerable.

Instead of working on the actual problem, there are just lame workarounds like giant frekking gyroscopes and flight computers and ""fixed"" weapons with some degree of rotation freedom and auto-aim.

Also there is a bug where component factories ignore resources if higher tech factories need ones to, but already have all they need - they are quick fixes in the internet wich are also 5 years old.

All the developers do is to publish new blocks but ignore the rest - so this game is still beta and did not succeed to evolve past it for frekking 7 years.

[h1]The Bad[/h1]
[h2]1. The control scheme.[/h2]
You look around by holding your right mouse button - but the game still moves the now invisible cursor. Which means once the cursor leaves the game window you suddenly loose all control. When do you most need to turn a lot? In combat. Loosing all control in combat sucks.
There is a way around that - you can bind the cursor to the window in the options. That's better - but still bad, because while you don't loose control, your view still suddenly stops turning, and you need to reposition the cursor on the screen before you can turn anymore.
Overall, this is miserable.

[h2]2. Minimal Information / Bad Communication.[/h2]
I've repeatedly been frustrated by a near total lack of information or badly selected partial information. Examples:

You're first shown the use of fabricators, conveyor belts and conveyor belt filters - which lead to the conclusion that fabricating bases will be terribly complex, span huge areas and be extremely expensive. A few missions later you're shown that fabricators, refineries and silos will manage each other automatically and a manufacturing setup is extremely simple.

Also, some blocks are menufactured not from materials, but components. I've not yet found any codex or description in the game. I've no idea what I need for a block until I've anchored a fabricator and selected the block. [i]Then[/i] I can mouse over the component and see what ressources it represents, but still not how to fabricate it. But some of them are made from other components, too, and you cannot even get a mouse over parts list for those.
Without the ability to produce components most of the long list of parts I could theoretically produce are completely unavailable to me. By now I've found out (from a YT video) that I need another block to produce them, but no idea how to get that. I've made multiple levels on my main license and gotten a few new ones, but in the game there has been no mention of components at all outside the icons shown in the parts list. So the first time I needed components to do something was barely a few hours into the game, but there has been no explanation or availability tens of hours later.

The order in which you are introduced to concepts is often suboptimal, you're often left to guess or ponder implied misinformation only to be shown/taught the real info much to late.

[h2]3. Glitches[/h2]
An older version of this review complained about the fact that constant combat made designing bigger vehicles and even simple bases next to impossible - because I was constantly interrupted by enemies spawning within aggro radius of me and attacking. This went on like that for a couple of hours. After I gave up, thoroughly frustrated for the night, that never happened again. Now enemies only spawn at some distance, and it's only on occasion they actually attack the base anymore, which makes everything a lot better.

On the other hand, my defense turrets regularily get attacked (and sometimes damaged or destroyed) - not by enemy techs, but by vegetation. Trees respawn into anchored tech, which triggers a violent collision detection, damaging blocks, sometimes destroying them, occasionally transforming them into the Leaning Tower because suddenly they're anchored at a 30° angle.


[h1]The Good[/h1]
Ignoring moments in which you'll bang your head against the above mentioned weaknesses, it's fun. Lots to tinker and experiment and do this and try that. So far, I haven't come across an obvious, ultimate design to follow, the lack of which is great game design to create a big, varied creative space for different builds.

It's not great (yet), but it's good. If you have a bit of patience for the downsides and you like silly humor, tinkering, creativity and the constant stream of small rewards, you'll be happy to spend some time with TerraTech.",1649073196,1649411980,True,1,0,0.509803950786590576,3,True,False,False

Happily parted with my money (£10gbp on sale) and foresee blasting past 100 hours since i haven't even started making aircraft yet. 

Haven't tried the multiplayer yet, don't really feel the need to get my creations blasted to hell and don't have any friends that play to try co-op.

Gameplay is your basic mmo style grind.. harvest for cash, missions for tech unlocks... how you choose to do the grind however is somewhat up to you.. a small fast buggy that runs laps round big slow techs, or a big lumbering tech that is covered with so many guns that you're clearing everything in sight with one press of the trigger? A big super-harvester that grabs everything in sight or a flying craft and cherry pick the good stuff?

Physics for car balance/behaviour seems great, with my poor design choices being the only reason i get stuck.

If you're looking for a fairly casual time sink with a lego-like familiarity to the building style, definitely give this game a try.

Now for the flip side of my love for the game, not complaints, just something i wish i could do.

Vehicle designs are locked into a 'single platform' design due to no hinged sections.. the inclusion of these and a more complex key-bind would allow for articulated platforms for manoeuvrability, or limbed techs with some sense of control.. as it stands i feel most drill and laser types are very niche use cases. (may well be planned for future update, or just flat out impossible within the engine... just something i'd thought about.. keyboard/flightstick combo for full mech-controlling immersion... yes please) :D

- Missions get very repetitive. There are only a few kind of basic missions, with corporations having at maximum one kind of unique mission. The quality of developper-crafted missions vary a lot, but many are often frustrating to play

Why ask why when this is art
Why parallel when I can just part?
Why does Vector think that he's smart
And does his dad know I know his part
Why did I have to live with my mom
Why do you think that I should be calm
Why want the moon, the World's in my palm
Is it crazy you think I've gone?

In case you want to know my feeling (that I have played for more than 50 hours just only in co-op)
My true felling is I want to grind money to build things with my friend but not in creative cause it's too boring to play
The truth is it's too annoying to grind money with just defeat other tech and selling some items then just repeat
That's enough to make me feel like an idiots who did  the same mission to grind money and some blocks 
Even thought when you need to sell something you need to keep the item inside the area which is very small and not just that you need to click it to sell
For me I need to use the auto clicker and set time to 1 second per piece and wait it for sell and that's just for selling a just single gun!! and it's very small!!
If you need to sell other things that is have a large size ex. some large Geocorp wheels you need to wait for almost 5 second for sell just a single piece!
But some large piece is under 150 BB But you have waste your time on that piece for around 5 second for a single piece if you need to sell them all you don't need to use them
Ok then just wait around for 1 hour and a half for selling 999 item of them 
you I'll see how I waste a time on selling more than just defeat the tech and grind from it not like in single player all you have to do is just place an auto miner in place then
go build your stuff around a little bit while you have passive income BB and with a good amount of passive I know the seam is not infinite source but definitely butter than
selling a ton of wheels and other for around an hours and This mean you can't build anything in this progress only allow to sell but not for build things
All I want you to know is can you please just bring the stuff that have only in single player to co-op please
or just make the selling item interface that made for selling item with a amount of the item please
Me and other would appreciate it if you did response to my commend I think a lot of co-op player think in the same way

I play co-op because I want to play and adventure with friends you know play with friends is a ton more fun than just play alone
Hopefully this is a big part for your decision to made the better game for our community 
And also love you Payload Studios thank you for made this game for us

There is really no variability in the missions, I get the same 2-3 invaders, and all of the techs that spawn in are so far off of the mid game fire power that they just get one shot. So please give the players something new to do.",1648308564,1648308564,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Sounds: Great, the vehicles sound like toys, do so most of the weapons

Combat: Basic. weapons autoaim towards the nearest enemy, but if you have multiple enemies, you can middle click to select one. There is a wide variety of weapons from the different corporation factions. Building a vehicle that plows into the enemy? You can. homing missiles? Got that. want to set up a bomber that drops a massive pile of bombs. Yeah that can be done too.

Crafting: You can build your own ""Techs"" which are vehicles, bases, turrets, etc. You can even build aircraft. Parts have weight which will affect your vehicle. Slap a tank turret on a car with tiny wheels, and it's not going anywhere. You can build cars, tanks, helicopters, hovercraft, and even a wierd monster truck/helicopter/bomber hybrid if you want to. You can take what remains of a destroyed enemy vehicle and use it yourself or scrap it for materials.

Story: There's a story, but it's not that interesting. IT can be ignored. This is a sandbox game.",1647896256,1647896256,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1]Played this game quite a lot by now. The game concept is really nice but it gets repetitive at some point. The quests help to entertain but even they will get boring for my experience. I but around 30 hours in a world, then i quit the game for a few months, i repeat. Multiplayer is not good at all since players are bound to each other trough a border. Would still recommend it since it's plenty of fun to construct your own robot and shoot others[/h1]",1647800541,1647800541,True,33,3,0.618661224842071533,0,True,False,False

late game is pretty boring with the only thing you can really do is optimising and exploring 
Bots are really easy to kill late game as they only get difficult to a point i have built the ultimate death robot and want an actual fight
quests later on are not difficult and there is one which is actually impossible

First off, the AI is awful. There is no AI for helis or planes, just for ground vehicles and hovercraft but even this is poor. Kind of makes a lot of the steam game images misleading because if you're planning on building the perfect jet for dog fighting, you're out of luck, ground attack only.
The AI they do have for ground vehicles is shockingly bad. They do nothing but drive in a completely straight line towards you shooting, they don't navigate obstacles like rocks, trees or cliffs. They just drive straight into/off them. They also only activate once you're painfully close. They're visible far before the AI switches on and they just sit there stationary until you get close enough. There are a lot of weapons that out range this AI on trigger so you can just cheese most enemies by shooting them from a distance and they just sit there and take it without moving.
Friendly tech AI is also pretty basic as only the guard/follow option is available meaning you can't programme techs to harvest resources etc, just either follow you around or guard a location (if you anchor the tech like a turret that is, you can't have a vehicle patrol an area).

Crafting is also (by the developers own admission) janky at best. It's very awkward to try and place things properly, particularly auto miners which for seemingly no reason require you to pick them up and place them over and over and over until you find the sweet spot and it finally works. 
I actually did my campaign run without crafting a single part (except for mission required crafting) and just using the buying stations. I just set some mining stations up for money (which is very tedious and frustrating to do as it is) and bought everything I needed negating the system pretty much entirely.
Oh, and there is no crafting at all in multiplayer because fuck you.

The building system is very unique and does a lot of things right but it is also infuriating to use at times. Seemingly basic utilities like mirror mode, copy/paste, a proper undo, moving multiple blocks at once (for example a wing that contains multiple parts) are all missing. You work with 1 part at a time, click and drag and that's it. 
The rotation system is pretty un intuitive as you have 1 single button to control the axis AND the attachment point relative to the tech, no rotation or movement axis drag, meaning sometimes you will sit spamming the button to get finally get the right angle and attachment point of which there are sometimes 10-15+ variations and if you miss it you have to spam press and go through them ALL again.
If you try to move a part that is supporting others all those parts fall off, this means if you spend 10 minutes making a wing with lots of parts and attachments then when testing the craft realise it's weight and lift is off, you can't just move the wing as a whole. You have to break it all off and start the wing again in the new location from scratch and then do the same on the other side. Trying to make large vehicles with lots of complex parts is a nightmare because to make things symmetrical you have to do it all manually.

It's also pretty buggy. The sound would randomly bug and stop working for around 10-15 minutes at a time then come back for no reason. Nothing would fix this, I tried loading a new tech, reloading my save and restarting the game but all that would work was just to ignore it and wait for it to come back. I also experienced several crashes in my 68 hours which isn't so bad but not so great either.

In conclusion I've mentioned a lot of negative things here and I want to say I don't hate the game, I actually really like it and there are many great things about the game (which you can read about in all the other reviews) but I feel I had to mention this stuff because it goes mostly un-noticed.
As mentioned, I would be willing to overlook all this if this game was in early access and when playing at first I thought it was and I was shocked when I checked the steam page and saw it was not. Sadly though, the response from the developers to many of these issues is simply that to fix them or add them would be too complex and that they may as well make a new game to include things like this.
This excuse I heard in response to AI aircraft, resource collection AI, moving multiple blocks in build mode, copy pasting blocks and having crafting work in multiplayer and it's frustrating as a player to hear things that would be a huge quality of life improvement for the players and things that are standard in many other games of this type just being dismissed in favour of a new skin pack.

I wish there was a maybe button because you'll likely have a really great time playing this game despite these issues but I feel this had to be said.",1644957406,1644957406,False,37,0,0.73571091890335083,0,True,False,False

Your guns cannot hit shit, somehow what should be a mobile setup with good dps is absolute trash. Whenever you've lost some blocks you basically gotta rebuild the whole thing (and mind you - that is going to happen a LOT (you CAN create builds, but realistically they work only once you've gathered enough and discovered/unlocked a variety of blocks)). Progress is slow, meaning it will take a LONG time before ANY decent blocks become available but if you don't invest countless hours practically consequently - you won't know what shit does what, making you incapable to do just about anything.

Other games require skill gained through time, like multiplayer fps games. in some you are able to simply jump in, usually rpg/story driven games. With this one you HAVE to do extensive research and experimentation to get things going, basically - minecraft but ONLY the redstone stuff. It's awesome when it works, but getting it working... You gotta watch vids, but then - what's the point...

This game can be a huge hit for you if you want to find one single game to drop endless hours into, however other than that the game is FAR too complicated.

I'd recomend it if you're looking for a building/survival type game that gives you a lot of freedom and different ways of playing the game.

-----Single-Player-----
Pros
Is fun, for the most part.
Guns automatically aim for you, so you don't have to worry if your aim is a potato.
First-time experience is quite the adventure.
You can create helicopters, planes, hovercraft and tanks or other wacky gizmos.
Crafting can be a useful mechanic if used properly.
Money farms can be created to exploit the powers of capitalism.

Cons
Auto-miners automatically stop mining when the player is too far away for some reason.
A.I. Cannot fly planes.
Missions can be repetitive at times.
-----Multi-Player-----
Pros
For most modes you don't need to have friends, although I would recommend though before playing CO-OP Campaign as griefing is a possibility from other players.
Multiplayer combat modes such as death-match.
CO-OP Creative allows you to show-off your builds or to battle with other players with-out restrictions like in sumo or death-match.

Cons
The multiplayer campaign feels somewhat incomplete compared to the single-player campaign, due to fact that all crafting blocks are gone it's significantly more difficult to get higher tier blocks, and to make money as well which in return makes those blocks requires even more grinding to get those blocks to begin with.

Notable
The range for most guns is terrible for dog fights
Lag should not be a surprise
I don't recommend building a large tech in CO-OP as if the host leaves, you would lose all your progress on building that tech.
 -----Other-----
Graphics are decent
Soundtrack is good
Mods are available on the steam workshop.
Community makes some wild techs.
-----Recommendations for Developers-----
Terrain could use some water (Oceans & lakes)
New biomes would enhance the exploration aspect of the game (Mountains, canyons, etc.)
Fix some issues with the multiplayer

It's pretty fun for the most part, building different techs and fighting enemies, especially from a creative standpoint (think messing around with the creators in Spore as opposed to playing through the actual stages over and over again). Personally I came to this game due to its comparisons to Robocraft, as I wanted to play a good game with similar vehicle building aspects. I'd recommend buying it on sale if it seems like your thing, unless you'd buy it for the multiplayer. That has issues.

I had a good time with it for 40-ish hours just playing the campaign so I think I got my money's worth (bought it 40% off on a sale) but there are a good number of issues with the game to watch out for.

[h1] Campaign Mode [/h1]
The world itself is pretty barren. There are 5 normal biomes (plus 1 rare one), filled with trees, rocks, resource nodes and trading stations. There are a few 'landmarks' as well but they're inconsequential. Enemies can be found standing completely still until you get close enough, or they can drop down from the sky. And that's really it. Obstacles, shops and enemies. 

So what is there to do in the campaign? Fight techs to take their parts (if they have anything worth taking, that is), finish missions for more parts, as well as to unlock new corporations and parts when you 'level up' your licence for a corporation, and harvest resources for money and crafting. Now, there are a few mission series that are relatively interesting and spawn unique buldings/locations (destroy a tech with high defenses in 20 seconds, buy a plane and destroy 3 turrets with your bomb, etc.), but most of them are pretty generic and boring, like 'destroy 300 rocks', 'find a crate nearby and kill 3 enemies that spawned', 'go through this race track fast enough'. Overall, the world feels pretty empty and aside from a short supply of decent quests it's just a grind for more parts so you could do the best part of the game, the building.

[h1] Enemies [/h1]
While at the start it's fun to unlock new parts and upgrading your techs or build new ones, it becomes very repetitive after a while. You aren't really pushed to become stronger aside from your own desire to get new parts and make cooler techs, as enemies are scaled to your current tech's value as a maximum (but you can still find a lot of earlygame enemies later on). The generally weak enemies combined with the dumb as rocks AI make most combat encounters very easy, especially once you've learned how to make better techs or found some decent blocks. 

You are rarely going to find anything that could give you a challenge past the early game, aside perhaps from the occasional 'invader' (rare, stronger enemies uploaded by other players. you gotta use the twitter integration to share your own, which also uses up that tech), though I haven't had any trouble with those past the first few. if you're lucky, an invader might have weapons that you can't buy yet, which makes fighting them a bit more rewarding, but you can easily just skip them because they will just claim a small area and will only attack you if you stay there for too long. 

There are currently no flying enemies in the game either, which limits the enemy variety to different cars and tanks only. It's nice that enemies will fight each other instead of ganging up on you at least, though it does make battles easier still. 

[h1] Resources and Bases [/h1]
TerraTech allows you to build bases using 'anchor blocks' that let you make stationary structures (or temporarily plant your moving tech into the ground to use parts that only work while anchored). Using various conveyor belts, silos, resource collectors and filters, you can build factories that can refine resources, create components and craft various parts for your techs, as well as sell those resources for money. The main benefit of crafting is that it is not limited by licence levels, allowing you to obtain parts you couldn't normally buy or get as quest rewards. 

That said, building a permanent base it's kinda pointless, as you can make 'snapshots' of any tech with a pilot cab attached, so you can just carry them around and rebuild them whenever as long as you got the parts. The stored resources won't go with them, but you can easily craft resource blocks that you can store in your inventory, as well as get more resources and components from putting parts from your inventory (like one of your 100s of obsolete weapons, if you're like me and collect all dropped blocks after a fight) into a scrapper. Because of this, harvesting resources and running around to deliver them to a base feels kinda pointless. I made a mobile base, a proper armed mining vehicle with a factory on its back, but soon realized that there's no point in going in circles to get the right resources when I can just use a scrapper or buy resource blocks instead. You might as well find a spot with a few seams of a more valuable resource, put an autominer on each and place down a small base made of a refinery and a resource seller and AFK for a while, then use the money to buy what you actually need.

Permanent bases are also just less safe than snapshots, since enemies might actually attack them. Enemies don't move if you're far enough away from them, and they don't spawn close to you, so as long as you stay in one place (such as when you put down a base to do something and stay next to it), it's very unlikely that anything will actually attack you, or the base.

[h1] Building and Parts [/h1]
Building techs is the best part of the game, due to the variety of vehicles you can make. Cars, tanks, planes, helicopters and hovercraft are all options, and all the corporations have their own identity and building focus. At first vehicles are very blocky but you can make much better looking ones later on with sloped and corner blocks and stuff. Proper flying techs can be a bit hard to make but it's pretty rewarding when you get them working (though they make the campaign even easier due to the lack of flying enemies but at that point who cares). One annoying thing is that if a part of your tech gets destroyed, it's going to stay destroyed. You will have to load up a snapshot of your tech if you got enough spare parts. You're going to want to have shields and repair bubbles to keep your tech safe but if you lose a more valuable part, or one that you can't buy yet, then you're out of luck.

I'd be surprised if anyone actually read this far cause of how much I'm rambling, but yeah, it's a decent game if you just want to build stuff in creative mode or something but pretty barren and repetitive otherwise. Buy it on sale if you want, but it's not really worth full price, especially given how stagnant development seems to have gotten. They keep adding new parts every once in a while but from what I've heard they have been promising updates to the AI and multiplayer for years now but haven't significantly improved the gameplay in quite a bit, so don't expect too much updates-wise.",1641327201,1641327201,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

285920,107276345,76561198065265998,0,9,5817,0,5279,1666316130,"A fun game to begin with, from how you can just easily make varied machines and defeat others in order to earn the new and old parts to further your progression. There's also missions which they feel rewarding if you get the new parts from completing them, and taking care in defeating the enemies to get the most parts out of them.

As you move from that particular gameplay loop, the issues of the game begin to show up which unfortunately results in a underwhelming game that feels frustrating and lacking in what it could've been.

The whole mining element and manufacturing feels like it wasn't really properly thought out that would fit the game's direction at least compared to the games like Factorio which feature complex but easily navigable mechanics that don't feel cumbersome. This game takes on a more cumbersome approach with it instead. In order to get the materials, you either have the two options which are to destroy the resource nodes and then bring back to your base or on the spot, depending on your tech's build. This would be fine for early game, however it ends up being the constant as a lot of materials can't be mined, which could be providing you a passive way of gaining the materials or earning money from it.

The other thing is you can mine the ""underground"" resource nodes, but depending the model of your miner. It can be extremely finicky, especially on more steep inclines that results you in spending minutes in trying to get the machine to properly detect what's below it which really adds up the cumbersome feeling. To make things worse, you end up having to spend some fair amount of time in trying to construct Conveyor belts to connect multiple mining units, in which it feels like a extremely arduous task to do due to how small these components are. And there's no vector-like node system or automation system for making resource transportation easier, resulting in a lot of the elements being done by the player. Another issue is that the miners WILL stop producing money if the player is too far away from the miners due to the chunk loading system.

The manufacturing part feels like it was tacked on and having no reason to exist at all when you could easily buy the parts or get the parts from enemies. And there's not much of a invective to get the resources since a lot of resources are usually often located far away from each other, and the lack of a proper inventory system like the part inventory that you have. So a lot of the times, you'll never find a need for doing that because the systems for that don't really exist that makes it efficient for the player.

The transportation in this game feels quite tedious and rather inefficient, despite just how much you constantly move around. A lot of times, I did find myself having to switch between the vehicles to get around faster but no options for switching between vehicles at different spots that are far away from each other. And there seems to be a jarring lack of rail and water based transport options too.

Which brings me to another point is how little variation the terrain can get. There's not really much of mountains, or even water features that makes the exploration more interesting. A lot of the terrain that I kept seeing are the same repetitive noise-based biome generation that barely reaches above a certain depth and height, which is quite frankly really boring. And not to mention the fact that it can easily get quite frustrating to move around due to how frequently bumpy it is for certain Techs with little variation in between that lends for more natural looking terrain.

Would I recommend this game? Well it really depends on what you want out of this game. But for me, I was hoping that this would be more akin of Factorio with much more fleshed out resource gathering and production mechanics. Even then, it still feels like it hasn't escaped out of Early Access. At this point, it seriously needs a proper sequel that functions as a complete rework of entire game.",1641271624,1641271624,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

My personal pros and cons list:
Pros:
- Build your own creation as you like it. From more common tanks to sci-fi hovers and even flying saucers. Whatever floats your boat.
- Play camapaign to craft, scavenge and grow your tech from a small trolley to mighty war beast. Or start creative mode and build whatever you like without limitations.
- You can build several techs and put them under control of A.I. to help you in fight. Or build stationary defence tower to guard your mining operations.
- Lot of pew pew action.
- No bugs were encountered so far. 

Cons:
- No manual aim. Press space bar and your tech will fire all guns at once with rather poor auto aim. I can't understand the decision to make such system. Fortunately there is a nice community-made mod ""Weapons group"" which enables assigning different keys to different guns. This makes situation a little better.
- Explosions. Blast wave punches through everything - neither energy shield nor armor can stop it. It's not uncommon to see your heavily armored tech explode from the inside despite having almost full shield, all because the blast wave was large enough to destroy the batteries protected by several layers of armor. This forces me to build techs capable of destroying hostiles as soon as I see them. Thus all my techs are inevitably ending up as variations of homing missile carriers. Yes, once you get access to missiles you can throw all those machine guns, cannons, lasers right into scrapper. All you need is Hawkeye's cruise missiles - slap 5 of those on any vehicle and it's one shot kill in 99% of cases thanks to the high precision of missiles and the way of how blast wave works.

The game overall is quite good, build your own tech and smash others, while also having a decent, and easy to understand crafting system.
Early game is mostly driving around as a living scrap heap, moving from mission to mission, every fight giving you parts essential to forwarding your survival
Midgame is unlocking the later factions, and building up specific techs to do certain jobs, like harvesting and fighting.
Endgame is where the game loses a bit of steam though, after you complete every mission, and building all the techs you want with the parts you have amassed from countless enemy techs destroyed. you wander the open world looking at the different biomes as you fly or drive over the terrain in you favorite tech.
As in terms of replayability, it all depends on you, and what you want to do in the game, same goes for all building/ survival games, there is no ""complete"" only the point where you feel accomplished enough to be happy.

NOTES:
This game is a good game and it's quite addicting. The only issues I have with the game is locked content in multiplayer, and the mass amounts of bugs. Audio cuts out, techs rubber band, and the game is very very poorly optimized. In both multiplayer and single player you can't go over 50% render distance without 0% quality, (I personally have an i7 7800X with an RTX 2070) and I can barely get 30 frames with any increase in quality. Also the fact that everyone needs to stick together to go anywhere if one person goes afk or is farming money the entire game comes to a grinding halt. The distance you can travel without a person moving is similar to ARK multiplayer.

TL:DR: 
The game is not the greatest with many bugs, and poor optimization, especially in multiplayer. SO IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A MULTIPLAYER EXPERIENCE LOOK ELSEWHERE.",1622479043,1638744378,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

it really is a great little game buuuuutttt...there are many things that are frustrating about it. 

1.obtuse item descriptions (they where trying to be funny and fun but ended up making it hard to know what many of the games items do) 

2. no real 'safe areas' to build in the campain mode until you unlock flying but even then so help you if you fall off the ledge and have no way to get back up.

Terra-tech also provides an interesting take on multiplayer combat modes that appeals to the player that prefers the more combat heavy experiences in the main campaign.

Fast forward to now, the game is super polished, fun, and even the unstable version is fairly stable. I haven't lost a world in a long time, and the one I did lose was somehow saved by another update. 

The devs for this game work EXTREMELY hard to pump out a good game whilst making their community happy. Early Access on Steam has been getting loads of crap due to some shoddy devs shafting users out of their money on empty promises, but the TerraTech team should be seen as the gold standard for Early Access Devs.

As for performance, you won't get far on the max settings before your computer begs to be mercy killed with a flaming axe, but the 2 graphics settings below Fantastic look just as great, and will spare your computer. The gameplay is based around an ever-growing tech you build from literally the remains of those who dared to face you. The first couple of hours are essentially the same, kill things, make your bot strong enough to take on the Liscense Boss, and so on, but after that gets out of the way, the world becomes yours to explore, die in, fly in, and dirty up to your hearts content.



Buy it.

Edit: Over a year later, the content updates only get better, and the game is looking better than ever. They've also been hard at work implementing storage solutions to help cut down on lag. I'd recommend this game twice over at this point in time.

All the small setbacks when ones tech would be destroyed made one rage quit many times but still always returned to improve on it's design. 
And then came ""the break"" i left the game cause it was unplayable on the laptop and forgot about it now i have found it again and so much has changed for the better but i can't help but get nostalgia when looking back at the quests that still look the same all the years later. Will always be a game i can return to and play a bit to relax but even if it is just a year between play sessions there seems to always be content waiting.

They didn't. In fact, more than 6 months have gone by since co-op campaign has come out and absolutely no updates have been done to it. I understand wanting to improve the main game, but there was already tons of stuff. The devs, as far as I can tell, have completely abandoned  the co-op campaign, and this game gets boring really fast when you play by yourself.

It has more than just build a thing and do a thing, it has quests, story, economy, and combat. Each mechanic is handled well and changes up the pace when you need it. The bright graphics give it charm and sets a good tone imo. Im always striving for a better and better build and this game makes that easy and manageable while providing plenty of options and build choices. 

The only things that bother me is sometimes there is strange visual issues (black squares pop up sometimes) and the flying mechanics need some tweaking.

IF you want a [b]survival[/b] game with [b]base building[/b], resource collection and manufacturing, then [b]don't buy this game[/b].


In my opinion 50% of the survival mechanics are broken. Let me explain why:

Basically in this game you can collect resources, process them and then either sell the products or manufacture blocks from them, which you can use to add to your tech.
But setting up a base is not only tedious but also aside from charging your tech pretty much useless, because of [b]bugs[/b] that are around [b]since Early Access[/b].

Especially the placing of conveyor belts is unusable, because it randomly auto-connects to adjacent conveyor belts and then you have to remove and place them again and again hoping they finally form the line you want.

And when you finally finished your base and think you can let it produce the stuff you need and go resource collecting. Then if you went out too far and come back to your base, it greets with your fabricators being stuck, so all you can do is cancel the production, which will make you lose all the already consumed components and start it again every time.
And that all because of a bug that is around since Early Access. So don't get your hopes up, that it will ever be fixed. (Yes, I reported it multiple times and had even devs reply, that it's a known bug...)

Ohh and theoretically there is an AI that can help you collect resources, but basically only if they are right next to your base, on flat terrain and you also stay, so it stays loaded.


So all you can do is fight bots, steal their blocks and complete some quests.

Controller-support is absolute garbage on PC, but the gameplay itself is mostly smooth and the world is completely open for you to operate however you see fit. And it just works.
 Building bases and outposts is a real joy, and once you get the hang of attaching a control module to everything and using named templates everything gets really smooth and you can focus on exploration etc.

The vehecles handle differently based on how you build them and you soon develop an understanding of how something will most likely handle before you drive it.

Combat is... basic. Some fun weapons in the later game, but it really only comes alive in multiplayer. Not that it wouldn't work in Singleplayer, but the AI is very simple. They chase you head on, rarely try to flank or outmaneuver you, making for functional but boring combat. Even enemies that vastly overgear your own vehicle can usually be beaten by using the AI to your advantage.

Story: doesn't exist.

Quests: randomly generated Gather- and Killquests aside, 90% are tutorials. The Timetrial races and a handfull of other handcrafted quests are well done and implemented though.

Crafting: Weirdly involved for how simple the rest of the game is. Not unintuitive, just... involved. And completely ignorable, due to the ability to buy every part available from shops.

Graphics: They do the job. Stylized and simple, but not ugly. Nothing feels out of place and it's overall very cohesive.

Biggest personal gripe: No ""Endgame"". The game could have done well with something, ANYTHING to do. A goal to work towards, Bosses to destroy, Maybe play up the rivalry between the companies. As it stands, you are thrown into a world, guided to the different Tutorials, establish a base and that's where the game ends. The second you have a stable and secure production set up, the game looses all sense of challenge and danger. Hence the reliance on Multiplayer.

Bugs: I came across very few. The occasional quest that gets stuck but even that hasn't occured for quite a while.

Verdict: 6/10. Very good foundation to build a game onto. Amazingly easy to understand and intuitive to use Building system to support a game that isn't there.

---

I wish I could put ""mixed"" as an option for rating. It's got great upsides for what it's aiming for, but in its current state it also has places where it falls short.

The pros:
- The concept of building your craft makes for a great time. Want to be something out of Mad Max? You can do that. Want to be a B-17? Go ahead. Ever thought of being a giant box of armor plating and nothing else? I mean, no one's stopping you. Seeing it in action, though, is what makes it great.
- The western-esque soundtrack compliments the game nicely. Driving through a vibrant alien world can still have some earthy feel to it.
- Achievements exist for skill, mostly. There's one called ""David and Goliath"" in which you take down a bigger tech with a much smaller one, just to name one of many.
- Base building! If you ever have come from Factorio, it's not as advanced but there are some similar cross-overs to resource processing and trying not to make jams.
- Resource management is pretty okay. Shiny metals await you out there.

Cons:
- There isn't really much to explore. The world is procedural, sure, but aside from random tech spawns and small trade outposts, there's not much else you can find outside of missions.
- Most missions contrast with the open worldliness of this game. It holds your hand and most, if not all, main missions from GeoCorp are uninteresting grind quests (collect 50 wood, mine 200 of this ore, etc) with no change later on.
- Missions are the only way to progress in purchasing higher-tier gear, as some blocks require license upgrades to buy. While this system itself isn't wrong, the associated missions could be refined.
- Enemy tech frequency is frustrating. You will always come across one, but despite its chance of running away from you, most if not all will try to engage in combat. It doesn't feel fun when it constantly happens and the game doesn't give you much of a breather to cool down.",1449881862,1634919380,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It has a ton of pros due to this, but has some pretty hefty cons to boot. Over-all, I would suggest this game to anyone that loves being creative, engineering, or has some level of ""Battlebots"" fandom. The game consists of a very basic, survival style vehicle building game until later on when more and more advanced parts are discovered or developed, leading to very intricate, or very basic and brutal vehicle designs. However, players may feel lost after completely unlocking all parts in the game, leading to a very open and very empty sandbox. There is boundless opportunity to be creative in this game; however, creativity will become your major limit.

Pros:
+One of the best physics, vehicle-building, and construction engines I have ever played.
+Tons of style and flash, from unique corporations that offer different weapons, weighted blocks, and cool devices to change how your vehicles work.
+Literally no limit to what you build, other than how large it can be (and even its maximum size can be absolutely massive). Structures, airplanes, anti-gravity vehicles, tanks, cars, hovercraft, or all of the above.
+A beautiful and basic asthetic that looks really good under any conditions.
+Amusing characters and hilarious item descriptions.

Cons:
-No real endgame with a complete lack of anything to do as far as objectives at the end. There are repeatable missions at the mission stations, but they offer very little in the way of unique encounters or fun scenarios. After maybe 10 or a little more, you quickly notice there's nothing really new to do.
-Manufacturing can be unintuitive, extremely complex, and just bug out, leading to frustratingly long endeavors.
-Enemy vehicles spawned into the game can range from oppressive to absolutely meaningless, seeming to scale from area instead of vehicle piloted. This means that driving around a scout vehicle can lead to some obscene challenges, but riding around in a massive weapon platforms just makes every engagement meaningless.
-Missiles are far too powerful and the ways to defend against them are far too inefficient, causing even the smallest of engagements to suddenly end your situation.
-Outside of 5 biomes, there's nothing really new to discover. The world is very large and very empty. Don't expect to roam around and find an enemy base with a challenging layout and fun guards defending it, because the most you'll get is a tree, or the occasional enemy player tech spawn that dies after one slew of missile barrages.
-A bug that caused one of the aforementioned enemy player tech spawns (""Invaders"") spawned mine underground, forcing my game to never spawn another invader again, leaving me with aforementioned trivial enemy techs to fight.

Plays a little similarly to actually quite a few games I’ve played, and was also one of the first games I ever owned on steam. If you like Scrap Mechanic/Trailmakers, some elements of Factorio, and games where you make vehicles fight with guns and bombs and stuff (such as Besiege), then this could be for you!

You start off with a tiny little block that represents your core, with 6 points of attachment, one for each side. You can attach more blocks to your core until you’ve got a nice looking frame, then add as many wheels, treads, wings, propellers, or rockets as you like for movement. After that, you can add special pieces that emit forcefields and healing zones. These run on power, so you also need to add some battery blocks. To charge the battery blocks, you’ll need to set up a base, with an anchor-block as a core. You can put some solar panels on this to generate electricity, and then put your batteries on the base, and now you have forcefields on your vehicle. Next we add weapons. There’s all sorts of weapons. We’ve got Machine guns, Lasers, Spears, Explosive cannons, Mortars, Drills, Shotguns, Homing-Rockets, and more. With these weapons you can kill off other AI-controlled vehicles, and then steal their stuff. Then you can sell their stuff for money, or just keep it for yourself. With money, you can buy whatever you want.

Back to the base, you can also add automatic mining machines, shields on your base, refineries, conveyor belts, storage silos, resource sellers, and more. With the use of crafting, you can also make your own stuff without killing other vehicles or selling things for money. 

Overall, the game is pretty fun, but it is kind of eh, pointless almost? While there is absolutely progression, there’s not really a goal or story to the game, and enemy vehicles eventually stop getting better once you get to a point where you’re just super overpowered. Don’t get me wrong in this paragraph though, I’m not saying the game is pointless to play, but before you buy, know that there’s technically not anything to work towards except trying to have a super powerful base and/or vehicle.",1481054910,1633583810,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

That is the intended design.  They make you come back to them and you have to sit there while they ""catch-up"" by mining at a rate of 10 seconds instead of 30 seconds.  So stupid!

1. Campaign has a simple but fun system. You mine and drill and refine and build your own machine. 
2. You can build ships, ground vehicles, airplanes, and mobile bases with default control scheme. 
3. Build tool is simple and easy to learn. 
4. Control is simple with auto aiming 
5. It's like a RoboCraft that supports singleplayer. 

Cons: 

1. You cannot build a Mech, (Gundam, MS,  Walker, Titan, whatever you called it.)  There's no walker parts and trying to make one yourself will be difficult and ugly. 
2. You cannot make custom movable parts, like a turning turret that made of blocks and mounts all the smaller guns. 
3. Control is simple but lacks detail configuration like firing in sequence or firing at different target, there's no firing arc indicator either. 
4. Singleplayer Campaign is rather empty, given a funny system. 
5. Very few ppl online.

If the game has walker parts (Bipedal, quadrupedal, whatever), it will be the ideal game I've been looking for forever. Right now it's like a 8/10.",1633219711,1633219711,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As of the time of this review this game has a lot of problems.
Yes its very simple, yes the A.I. is trash, both friendly and enemy, yes you are attacked while in the middle of building stuff, but those actually arn't my gripes with it.

My problem with this game is how many of the available parts really just don't work, and it always seems to be the interesting ones.

You have all the parts for a helicopter, but good luck building one that actually works. You have hovercraft parts, but without exploiting accidental bugs good luck building one that isn't a piece of shit. I mean for a game about building fun machines out of available parts, it sure doesn't feel like the devs tested any of this shit to see if it actually works. And it's been like this for years so it isn't going to change.

The basis of a good game is there, but the development is so basic its unreal. There are bugs littered through out the game, and we arent talking elaborate bugs, we are talking things like turrets shooting at friendly targets, production buildings not pulling from base inventory etc etc. Now one might thing its because the game is still early days, and that is true to a point. But before you use that excuse, bare in mind, the devs literally had basic features as providing a map as part of their short term goals in 2018. Its now 3 days away from Q4 2021 and still to sign of it. Either the devs are in over their heads, or they aren't putting in the effort they should for bug fixing and basic quality of life fixes.

I hope these issues get fixed, i really really do, because as i said, the basis of a good game is there, but players should not be expected to find work around for bugs that haven't been fixed for, according to the community pages, years.

I might review again at some point in the future, but as of Q4 2021, its a no from me. Hopefully the game gets to a state in the future where i change that opinion.",1632783144,1632783144,False,2,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

So me and my friends all bought the game to play together, and we did, until we realized that we had been ""scammed"" by the developers. And I wish I hadn't had to use harsher words, but just read the description of the game in Steam:
""Team up with other intrepid prospectors in Co-op Campaign, ....""

It doesn't say that it's not complete, or not the same as single. So after looking like an ass with all my 4 friends who bought the game because I recommended, I still had some hopes that it was a work in progress. Patch in, patch out, and no progress except adding more blocks, many of them purely cosmetic in my opinion, since they are Unity objects with texture and collision boxes, and no actual logic in to them.

</end rant>

No, I do not recommend anyone to purchase this game, ESPECIALLY if you want to play Coop. If the devs ever redeem themselves, I'll gladly change my review, but at this point, I have no hopes that this will ever happen.

The game idea is somewhat unique, atlest I haven't found anything like it. Sadly, it's not very well executed. At times there seems to be more bugs then features. The AI is extremly limited and once you figure it out and design accordingly you can just stand still and hold the fire button to deal with any of the random spawns. The controls when designing things are very limited, making it slow and clunky to make anything more then the very basic. Quests are a good addition, but the writing is really bad. Single player is a bit too repetative/grindy. Co-op just removes a lot of blocks and quests, and tethers players to a way too small area. The music is good, makes me think of Firefly

I have asked for help on the official forums and on the Steam hub and never received any response, neither from the community nor from the developer. This is the only game that has a problem with controllers on my computer.

Edit:
I have found the cause of the problem: I am using a keyboard with analog keys (Roccat ISKU Force FX) which is stored by Windows as Game Device 0 - i.e. as the first game device. All other controllers have a higher number. It seems that Terratech only supports the first game device. The pop up dialog for remapping controllers at game start does not work (nothing happens when I move a stick to remap the axis). A remedy is to start the computer with a different keyboard.

It does get boring after a while, especially the flying missions, which suck ass.
It's also very RNG in terms of loot, one mission in particular gives you the second(?) most powerful cannon in the game, but there's also a high chance of it being destroyed. This is important because if you don't just redo this until you get the drop, you will literally be unable to pass another mission that requires that level of DPS.

However, returning to the game to find the same problems I had with it in late 2015...Yeah, not going to fly with me. Major problem as of right now, is that in early game the player is given NO TIME to breath; ever. You can't stop and build for a minute or enemies will wiggle-wander closer to you until they're within aggro range and...well, there goes 30+ minutes of progress as you get shredded while you were working on an incomplete design :)

And R&D is only so useful for designing, because you can't easily cross reference how many of what you had when you closed the campaign to go to R&D to attempt to side-step this issue.

I'd say spawns probably could do with being pushed away a little more for early game enemies, they do tend to spawn far too close to the player due to their reduced size. And while they are theoretically weak...it's hard to fight when it's endless combat for 20 minutes. Enemy wander AI could maybe also be taught to be patient, and not wiggle closer to the player if it's idle and within AI processing range as well. Could also help if there was an options-menu toggle to show aggro range on the map

Finally, the last gripe I have with campaign: Restriction of the SCU to far too late in the game? Trade station SCUs only help so much, and cobbling everything dumped on you onto an anchor takes precious time...time the game spends spawning more problems for you. Personally I just think the SCU should be starter gear, or given at the first visit to a trade station. It's integral gear that the player should become familiar with early on anyway, I don't see why it's held behind missions for so long, other than artificially dragging out the early game.

for the price to have gone up to what it has, and still have the same bugs and balance issues as 6+ years ago, is honestly insulting to players.",1440874887,1627072900,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-the main one being the flying. there's no such thing as perfect balance. your plane will always go up or down, no matter what you do the thrust vs center of gravity is off regardless. I like the science behind air dynamics that being said, I played alot of kerby space program, I decided to experiment, see about getting the fastest plane possible, i managed to create one that almost hit the sound barrier, 1125 mph, problem is that without the option to center it, it wobbled all over the place going in a straight line. the wings contracted and extracted like a musical instrument or something. that being said, your plane speed is hard capped somewhere do to the physics in this game. you really cant make a plane that does above 120 mph without running into glitches somewhere.
-the 2nd biggest issue is the spawning with the planes. I wanted run around fighting but the spawning radius is so small that you rarely see anything once you hit the sky. so you build this high tech killing machine and kill one or two enemies. that's it, the plane is really only good for going from point a to point B. On the other hand, you make a standard vehicle and try going from point a to b and enemies are everywhere. air combat is more or less eliminated by the lack of enemy spawns.
3rd issue I would have to say is its a sandbox game without sandbox options. Want more enemy spawns, I like fighting, Want to feel like Im surviving rather then the enemies are just an annoyance while i'm trying to build then gone when im fighting. higher yields, in the late game equipment is insanely expensive it seems out of balance.
- I hate the collision damage, because there's not much you can do about it. you build a highly efficient harvester then try to drive at full speed, you are losing random pieces just from bumps on the ground that you can't even see.
the 5th biggest I would have to say is the combination of unrealism vs realism. they add physics, mass vs speed, etc, so you build a big ship and your vehicle slows down, makes sense, but then you can't add more engines, more tires won't do anything. if you choose to scrap enemy vehicles, you put this big magnet on the back of your vehicles, not realistic, but cool, but then the physics are there, so as you collect parts your vehicle is weighed down and you start dragging it across the ground and its chipped away in pieces, or when the enemy attacks you blow up your own pieces. the only real option you have is to port in the teleport system, send your parts to inventory, then despawn it, over and over again.
 -Despite how much I personally like this game I would not be able to recommend it to a friend because there are too many core issues that I can find a way to work around but an inexperianced player could not. they wouldn't understand why their vehicle is being destroyed just from driving at full speed. they would not understand why their plane doesn't seem to work right regardless, and the game doesn't seem complete. the helicopters are advertised but try driving one. you can't build a heavily armored vehicles because without the ability to up the performance thru engines or some other means, it won't drive.
-The tires are an enormous issue. tank treads aren't supposed to get stuck, bottom line, yet most the time they cant even make it up hill.

exploring is pretty pointless, after playing for a bit, the only reason you would explore is to find the different biomes and that's it. the terrain and structures can be cool, but that feeling of fascination doesn't last long. perhaps the chance to find extremely strong techs or some other reward for exploring would make this game a lot more fun.

the other major flaw would be how slow the game can be sometimes. i mean literally, with the blocks you get, you're practically forced to have slow and bulky techs with lots of batteries and giant wheels. i think that having some way to give small speedy, even close range, techs a niche would also improve the game. (maybe being able to dodge would be a way to make glass-cannon-type techs viable? right now it's sort of hard to dodge due to explosives and how venture is the only faction focused on speed)
also, a few of the factions are sectioned off for late game which kinda sucks. you're forced with gso and geo-corp-two factions that reward slow and bulky techs. i think variety is extremely important for more replay ability and enjoyment. 
slow and bulky techs are fun for the first few times you play but being stuck with them early to mid game is boring. with the way the terrain is, slow and bulky techs are discouraged even more. i want to be able to have a fast tech that can also beat other techs. some way to make the pve more skill based would be great because right now, it's just run into a tech and hold down space. improving the pve would make the game a lot more fun because i think the two most fun parts about terratech is the creative aspect and the pve aspect.",1625609350,1625609350,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is extremly satisfying and rewarding. As you play you will eventually gain access to refining and crafting wich, while not being that much fun, give you something new to do. It give you a reason to build bigger.

Now the negative side of things.
I bought this game to play with my brother as it said it was Co-op, wich is a complete lie.
Yes my brother can join my game and have his own tech.
Yes he can help me do missions and defeat ennemies.
But!
He does not have his own inventory or money. He must use my stuff and is tethered to me like ark used to do in early access. The crafting has been completely remove from Co-op mode, wich removes the purpose of making bases.

Basically, what the devs call Co-op is basically just a player taking control of one of your AI vehicles and following you around the same way and AI would.

People asked the devs to fix those issues and the devs said it would be impossible to make Co-op work otherwise, wich is just a way of saying theyre too lazy to do it.

So overall, the game is AMAZING if you like playing ALONE but is it NOT Co-op.

Edit: After playing 200 more hours, Here is what i have to say.
1. The game is amazingly addictive.
2. There is alot more content in the solo campain than there is in the coop one.
3. Despite my second point, the game is alot more fun in coop.
4. This game is a bug simulator and the dev is more concerned with adding more block than he is with fixing the darn thing.

So overall, i maintain my negative review because in its state, the game is not worth buying at full price and the dev dont seem to care or be competent enuff to fix it.

To the dev: Dont take it the wrong way, your game could be a best seller if you gave it the love it needs instead of focusing all your ressources into adding more buggy things to it.",1622463038,1623968090,False,111,8,0.816416740417480469,4,True,False,False

One problem with it is the combat is unnaturally infuriating. The weapons try to auto aim, but they always end up either missing or hitting parts that you want to keep, destroying them and frustrating you. Not to mention that every single time you're in combat, the enemy flanks behind you. Endlessly. Constantly. And you can't catch them sometimes. They just slowly keep shooting behind you, and you often can't even turn fast enough to hit them, let alone fight back. This leads to a frustrating cycle of trying to shoot them, the guns automatically shooting places you don't WANT them to shoot AT, and being unable to fight techs that you normally would be able to dominate if it wasn't for the fact that the turnspeed is so inconsistant that it leads to immense frustration.

The good is that the building IS. INCREDIBLE. Honestly you can build pretty much ANYTHING in this game. You want a plane? Well guess what there's massive wings. You want a giant hellicarrier for a mechanical marvel reference? Good news there's hovercraft. You want a massive, unstoppable fortress that can withstand any attack that comes at it? Well there are anchor parts, large cannons, mortars, rotaries, shields, solar generators, refineries. Honestly, I have found very few games that can rival this one in sheer amount of customization. Think of it as a better, more mechanized version of Spore. (With a better story, though that bar wasn't that high to begin with.)",1468439501,1623861103,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is fairly simple: Build your tech, destroy other techs for parts, build yours bigger, repeat. The game also has different missions to do in the campaign from simple finding dead drops to destroying intricate enemy bases.

Multiplayer is kind of ""meh"" to me. When they first announced they were adding multiplayer to terratech, I was astounded, and I never knew it could be possible.

Additional Notes:

The game seems to have a lot of care put into it, and it's overall great.
It's actually fantastic and I'd probably play it a lot, but the only issue is that I don't like the idea of always being in a situation that I could lose everything.
That's my only reason to not get this game, you're in a constant risk of losing everything.

The early game is super grindy, but as you unlock more corporations it becomes much more fun. This game has come so far from when I bought it 3 years ago and it is still receiving frequent content updates.

My main problems:
Quests repeat themselves often since many are procedurally generated.
Terrain is bland and a little broken, but that's mainly a limitation of procedural generation.
The game runs pretty horribly, even on my relatively strong system I drop into the 30s in medium sized fights.

Overall, great if you don't care about the quests and just build cool stuff :)",1586817686,1620076706,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

When you're starting out and trying to mind your own business, you're constantly harassed by other techs dropping in, no matter how big or small, every 10 - 60 seconds. They drop in a radius around you, sometimes close, sometimes far. They may be paused/suspended, but the moment you get close, they animate and make a beeline straight for you and your backside. Most of the techs are gunbricks by the time that you've managed to get into the military corporation in this game (who has a vehemently ceaseless, sawdust-huffing hen-swabble of a miserable dosser for your majority of having to put up with this useless pile of scrap, who's best words aren't even memorable to the point of being noteworthy. Not to mention the ""agent"", who is just as useless, if not even more so as she is a joke within a joke that was left to ferment for over a milennia, it seems. Get with the times and be more useful instead of seeking a kick, moron. - Side note, the military guy finally starts recognizing your potential after a while, but the agent is a waste of time. Least you get to bomb things though.)

The AI is straight garbage, having vehement (there's that word again) problems in navigating even hills or around static objects. You have to babysit the AI every time at the time speaking, they're less than basic, their only pro being that they can even navigate at all, let alone be cannon fodder They don't even stop 1mm away from you and CONSTANTLY TRY TO PUSH YOU AROUND WHILE YOU'RE TRYING TO BUILD OR LOOK AT SOMETHING. D'you know how rile-up-inducing that shit is? I'll give you an idea. When you're at a party (if you've been to one of course, can't speak for everyone, we've had different experiences) and some gangly-haired fuck-knuckle drunkard of a night-time shades-wearing, beach-shirt & crocs douchenozzle with a riced out Corsa/Fiesta comes and keeps shoving you around as you're trying to mind your own business? That's this ""buddy"" AI. Harvesting AI was removed, so you're better off getting in your big brick of a creation and mining yourself. (to their merit, a Payload employee explained the reason for this, being multiple bases confused them.) Did I mention they were garbage?

Oh, but here's the best part. The enemy AI's don't stop spawning, even when you're trying to FUCKING TIME TRIAL. Even when you're trying to harvest, these insufferable, rat-ash-huffing, smooth-brained oafs will continue spawning, with some downright painful machinery (The first one who really messed up my base was a well-built GeoCorp, yellow guys who harvest better than anyone in the game. My base was well built, with everything I needed, and this prick spawned with a behemoth-sized rig with a powerful shield, multiple guns, and mining machinery and messed it all up.) who then proceed to harass you and try to end your existence in this game for no other reason than you're playing. Trying to complete a mission? Fuck you, have a few enemies, go fuck 'em up boys. Trying to harvest? Oh, no no no no no, we can't have that sir, go fuck yourself. Here's some enemies for you in particular. Trying to build something? Let's surround you with enemies, so when you're done, you can go fuck yourself even harder. Not even exams are this hard for you, why should you have peace or some fun?

And last but not least, some missions require you've grinded enough cash, or even got enough of a juggernaut that you can survive a hailstorm or speed along REAL FAST. The hover trial mission i'm trying to do? AI on the trail + hills = Bad News Barret has come to give you no reach-around.

Honestly this game pisses me off, just let me fucking build in the campaign damnit.

I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning.

I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night.

It seems like all you ever do in TerraTech is complete boring missions that are just ""go across the map to this destination while trying not to get killed"". The combat is super annoying because there really isn't that much strategy other than ""have a lot of guns"". The battery charging mechanic is super annoying because it just means you have to stop your progress to recharge every few minutes. The building interface is also super annoying because even my relatively low level car had tons of different parts that were constantly needing to be rearranged/rebuilt when I gained or lost a part. 

So overall, too much of this game felt like management of my vehicle, and the parts that weren't were super annoying and boring. Not the game I was looking for.",1618212551,1618212551,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So far I don't think I've had a single play session where something wouldn't frustrate me to some extent, so let me put out a couple issues that stood out to me personally.

-Turrets do not lead the target properly. Your vehicle's momentum is added to the projectile's momentum on top of that, meaning that any attempt at making a fast and agile combat vehicle is not viable. All of the fighting I've done so far involve stacking guns on top of guns and carpet bombing the crap out of the entire area in order to try and smash an enemy.
-There are no weapon groups, which renders some weapons entirely useless. Scoops, supposedly capable of flipping an enemy, are activated by the same key as all the other weapons. So either avoid firing at the enemy in an attempt to flip them, or fire at will and see your scoop flailing randomly at a set interval. The same goes for rotatable drills, since you can't lock them in a position that's most suitable.
-There is no way to adjust the difficulty setting as far as I know, which in early game can overwhelm you. I've read that in late game this turns around to the point where there's no challenge, but I'm not really willing to find that out.
-The enemies spawn at a set distance from the player, regardless of anything else. This can make the player be an active threat to their own base, because the enemies can drop right on top of a player's anchored structure and then proceed to obliterate it. So obviously, you want to have all your structures supplied with an AI module and a shitton of guns. But remember bad turret lead?
-There is no map. You have only your memory and a tiny radar minimap to tell you where's what, and where your own structures are. Friendly blips on the minimap will disappear if you go far enough from them, so if you want to revisit a mining base you built you better write down its coordinates in Notepad.
-Production is bugged. If you have a fabricator gathering resources to build a block and move over 500m away from it, the fabricator will never produce the block – even after having the resources gathered. Cancelling the production and ordering another one will not fix this. You have to remove and replace the fabricator.
-Co-op campaign has no crafting, which is a shame – but from what I have gathered is currently in the making – and the trading stations only sell blocks that have been discovered by you or the other players. This renders exploration completely pointless.
-Building, which at first is very intuitive, can become tedious. There's a single key dedicated to rotating blocks. If you have a large block with over 20 attachment points, this will make it a chore to find the one you want, since you have to iterate over all of them.
-Additionally, replacing any block that's buried deep inside your grid can be frustrating, since blocks will want to attach anywhere but the one place you want them to.

And you know what's the most disappointing part about this all? Quick googling can show that a lot of these issues have been known and requested to be added or fixed for years. Don't expect any of that to change soon.

If you want to try this game out, I'd suggest waiting for a major sale and/or a free weekend. But even that might not make all the issues apparent.",1618044456,1618044456,False,8,2,0.587225914001464844,0,True,False,False

For 6 years only a... ""we want to put it in, but...""

You can build factories and bases in the game, but without waypoints and a real map, of course, it's pointless.

it would have been different if they had said from the start that factories and bases should only be mobile... stationary is not planned, but they have been talking for 6 years !!! that they want to include a map and the bases and factories are much faster and easier to build stationary. 

Dear unity engine developers, please build 2-3 waypoint and map systems into your engine, so that your licensees can also build them in. It doesn't work by itself for many ""game developer"" !

Edit :  A few more things I have found or that are missing

Helicopters (also the ones that the developers provide for testing) cannot hover. You must always fly forward or backward

There is no data on the weapons (although the game knows them of course).

No data on range, damage, penetrating power etc.

NPC attacker spawning in race missions where you need planes or special racing cars. This is of course very disturbing

Edit 2 : I am really pissed off. If you don't have the necessary raw materials in the factories and go farming to get some, the factory still doesn't work afterwards. You lose a lot of raw materials because you have to tear down factories to reset them because cancel doesn't work for the component factories either... a simple query are all raw materials there, if no i don't start working but tell you what's missing is extremely easy to program...easier than fixing the bug... proof... see the bug and the other players know it... who knows how old it is !

i've worked with other game developers who wouldn't have let this shit go out of early access if there were still bugs like this... and they've been out of early access for 2 years already... botchers !

Apparently, the players are also aware of the bug... I just wonder why the game is so well rated?

I would have more bugs to report, but since they can't even get essential things to work in 6 years, I might as well not :(

Many other games have the same kind of premise, harvest resources and level up (kind of) to get more parts and to make a better, more advanced main vehicle. I used to play a lot of this game on the Xbox One, and the 7000 cpu limit in the CAMPAIGN was awful. I couldn't make more than 3 vehicles! But then, I put 20 dollars into Steam, and out came this masterpiece.

To start, this game on Steam has, and listen to this closely, NO. CPU. LIMIT. Oh my god, if you have a decent pc, this game is amazing. You can build huge bases so big they make you lag just by looking at them, you can create 50 small little swarm techs to overwhelm your enemies, I mean, you can even build a Halo Warthog if you're skilled enough (and have the blocks). The campaign of this game is wonderful, the quests are mostly busy work at the beginning, but as you level up your ranks with the various factions, they get into really fun quests with custom areas. I don't want to spoil too much, as I'd recommend the campaign first.

Okay, and on to the Creative Mode. Creative is, well, creative. You have unlimited of all the blocks, and you can make essentially whatever you want, similarly to the campaign, although creative gives you much more to work with. Obviously.

And finally, the Multiplayer Mode. There are 3 modes of multiplayer, as I recall. Deathmatch, a customizeable mode where you can have fun defeating your friends or randoms online in multiple maps, With multiple sizes of each. Each kill gets you more and more parts, however, if you die, you die. Have fun getting everything back. Next up is the co-op modes. Co-Op Creative and Survival are like survival and creative, but with a few blocks unavailable (I'm guessing because of issues with two people). Overall though, it provides a fun experience despite missing a couple essential blocks.

So, to conclude my essay (I've been typing for 15 minutes), Terra Tech is an open-world, infinitely generated sandbox game, with obviously building mechanics. AIs to kill or ally surround you always, and I've never seen 2 of the same enemy across either Xbox or PC (Despite bosses and quest characters). Overall, Terra Tech is a fun game that provides hours of fun, whether you play solo or with friends. That concludes my recommendation.

I played TT a lot when i bought it, but i haven't found myself able to pick it back up

Cons:

The game is very child oriented (understandibly)
the UI is clunky and not-so-easy on the eyes
Everything is horribly bright
The terrain is boring
Base building is almost non-existent beyond putting things on the ground
There is no way to ""intended"" way to fast travel
No custom way points
Cannot select points on a mini map to know which tech you are driving to.
No directional firing, just drive around and point 
Air lance, and directional shields may help the lacking combat depth, not bothered to check it out.

I have been craving BK:N&B for years, and although lacking, it still scratches the itch in some aspects.

I really enjoy the vehicle building, and hoarding parts none the less. Just know that if you are very particular about QOL you might need to pass for now",1610503304,1617301880,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You start small but every mission and battle gives you more access and more parts.  Before long, you go from a collection of scrap items to huge vehicles and the ability to buy anything.  The maps are generated in such a way that if you ever get bored of your location, you just pick up and move to something better.  Plus, if you ever get tired of single player, there is a multiplayer option; and competition between players.  The PC version is of course, much better since you have less limitations.

I bought the game a few years ago and tried it again recently and it has improved so much. it has amusing quests and a satisfying game play loop that guides you without treating you like a child.

The main limit is your own creativity.

Oh yeah protect your command block, if that breaks your whole contraption falls to pieces and then you have to go rescue it from another veritable fortress that will one shot the dinky rover the game gives you when you die.

One problem that i ran into is, when you die, it gives you the option to recreate the vehicle you were using. However, its really easy to inflate the cost of your rover because every enemy you defeat drops a lot of blocks. As such i built my creation from the corpses of my enemies. my early game rover was 10x the cost of the money i was able to make in the early game.

You will have to transport the parts of the enemy vehicles you destroy back by attaching them to your roof.  Refining and crafting will be nearly non-existent at the beginning.  But within a few hours you will be building your own factory that can launch raw materials off in to space.  But if you refine them, they are worth more!  To refine them efficiency, you could really use some filters and silos, which you can manufacture yourself!

The fighting is nothing to write home about, but it can be difficult at times, and when you crack a big guy open and harvest all of his pieces, it's great!

One thing that made me not buy this game for months was thinking it was creative-only, or that crafting your vehicle was nearly free; like Scrap Mechanic.  That's not the case at all!  You will need to either harvest lots of ores or kill lots of enemies.  You will also have a fairly weak shield, so you might lose quite a bit of your vehicle if you are careless.
