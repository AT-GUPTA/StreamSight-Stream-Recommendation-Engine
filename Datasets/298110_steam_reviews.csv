Thankfully, if you buy it straight from Ubisoft Connect it doesn't do that. Trust me. Do not buy this version. Buy it here. https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/far-cry/far-cry-4 

Also, please ignore the developer response. That tip they gave did nothing to fix it.

2023 update: I decided to check and see if anyone else had the same problem. Turns out i'm not alone. This fatal error is all caused by installing the map editor. 

In late March 2019 Steam released an update for the map editor that causes the game to break if you use it. 

If you buy this version. Just don't even think about installing the map editor. If you want to use the map editor, buy it straight from Ubisoft's store instead.

If you'd prefer to continue using this version, check here for tips on how to fix it.

Additionally, I've decided that a good Far Cry game feels like a psychedelic Bond Film with dope weapons and insane villains. Jason from the previous title is probably a more compelling main character, but the stories here are nothing special. Far Cry is clearly about the gameplay and giving you an open world with a lot to explore and combat. 

I enjoyed the major improvements to the UI, which made the crafting system much easier to use. I also really enjoyed the environment; what a beautiful setting, and impressive world. I found myself getting tons of EXP from small tasks such as taking down propaganda posters, destroying masks, and discovering locations. Honestly I had a really good time with this game - it surpassed my expectations and was the quickest I've beaten a game in a long time.

Set amidst the stunning backdrop of the Himalayan mountains, the game delivers a gripping narrative, intense action, and a vast open world ripe for exploration.

As a fan of the Far Cry series, I was immediately drawn into the game's immersive world and engaging gameplay. From liberating outposts to embarking on daring missions, every moment in Far Cry 4 is filled with adrenaline-pumping excitement.

One of the game's standout features is its rich and diverse environment. The lush forests, snow-capped peaks, and bustling towns of Kyrat provide a breathtaking backdrop for the action-packed adventure. Exploring the world on foot or by vehicle never gets old, and the sense of freedom to tackle challenges in any way I saw fit was incredibly empowering.

The game's story is also compelling, with memorable characters and thought-provoking themes woven throughout. From the enigmatic Pagan Min to the brave rebels fighting for freedom, each character adds depth and nuance to the narrative, making every encounter feel meaningful and memorable.

Of course, it wouldn't be a Far Cry game without the signature chaos and mayhem, and Far Cry 4 delivers in spades. Whether I was engaging in intense firefights with enemy soldiers, taming wild animals to aid me in battle, or soaring through the skies in a wingsuit, the game never failed to keep me on the edge of my seat.

In conclusion, Far Cry 4 is a must-play for fans of the series and anyone looking for an epic open-world adventure. With its stunning visuals, immersive world, and adrenaline-fueled gameplay, it's a journey I won't soon forget.",1685457618,1708273713,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Some animals you skin say they give you their skin, but they do not get added to your inventory. Animals with literally no protection but their own skull and skin can take high powered sniper bullets to the dome and run off... Now I know it's focus isn't on that, i'd be happier to go play a hunting game, but come on you HAVE to kill some of these to get loot bag upgrades and to upgrade anything. Unskipable cut scenes are a drag. Spoiler --> [spoiler] Most notable annoyance I had was with the mission of you sneaking in to Paul's office to help Noore save her family, when sneaking into his compound and failing the mission (as in dying) you get sent ALL the way back to where you have to sneak into the truck AGAIN.

[h3] [b] [i] Really awesome worth the money and time spent on it. Loved the Ending and everything has to offer. My favourite part was killing all the animals. I wish I could hunt animals in real life. It surely seems to fun seeing animals die in-front of your eyes, especially when they fuck up missions. Also, you can kill enemies using baits.

I forget the best part. This game has to offer a lot of STEALTH. I LOVE STEALTH.

This game still has some bugs but it can be compensated for the scenic beauty this game has to offer.

I also love the part where all the NPCs abuse in Hindi. Saala, MADARCHOD. CHUTYA.
It's refreshing and fun to hear when NPCs abuse in Hindi. I wish they had used more abusive language. [/i] [/b] [/h3]

[h2] [b] [i] I rate this game a solid 8/10 and a must recommend for everyone who to play Far Cry series, they can start with this game. Please ignore some glitches and bugs. WE CAN'T ALWAYS GET WHAT WE WANT. After all. it's UBISOFT they need to fuck some things up. So, suck it up, be a man, grow up and don't complain like a PUSSY.

It goes neck to neck with FC3. 

Cons:
No steam achievements!
Characters are not so memorable compare to FC3.

Pros:
Everything else in this game is better than FC3.
Graphics are so good that it feels like 2018 game instead of 2014.
Jungle is awesome to explore. Surprised with animals quality and verity. Hunting is super satisfing.
Locations are beautiful. Himalaya is breath takingly beautiful.
Gameplay is great as FC3 but little more polished.
Voice acting is also at top includes NPCs voices and calls.
Villain is good enough to make him as your enemy.

Worth playing even today!

[h3] Actual Review (Censored Spoilers) [/h3]
Coming directly off of Far Cry 2 and 3, I was completely blown away by how good this game looks. Literally for my first 5 hours or so, I couldn't help but constantly be baffled by how real the environments look, and my GTX 1060 handled the game pretty well at medium graphics settings.

[h3] Story [/h3]
Storywise its good. Pagan Min is nonexistent save for the beginning and end of the game with various radio dialogue during certain story missions, but he is a pretty well written villain. The concepts the game presents and focus on player choice was also an interesting effort. FC3 has the better story overall, [spoiler] but mainly because some of the main characters in FC4 feel like they're there to serve gameplay purposes rather than serve the story (AKA Sabal and Amnita). [/spoiler]

[h3] How I Wish FC3 Had Some of These New Features! [/h3]
Gameplay wise, its FC3 but enhanced. Some of the new stuff makes the game feel very gamified, so I opt to turn off most of the hud/icon elements. Far Cry historically is a very immersive game series which is why they have so many HUD and accessibility options in the first place, something a lot of other FPS games should be doing as well. But most of the combat mechanics are a straight upgrade from FC3.

For example: being able to move bodies after a kill. FC3 only had the option the drag bodies after performing a takedown and you couldn't move them afterward, so adding that feature enhances the realism of the game. I also found myself constantly cycling between all the new and classic throwables since each (grenade, molotov, throwing knife, and bait) have a distinct use. I probably did use the knives the most since they don't alert enemies. The syringe system from FC3 makes a return as well. To be honest, I never used it at all in normal play because I find it very gamey, and I had no problem with the game by not using it, so it's up to you really.

Player choice is a big focus of the gameplay as well.. You can opt for either stealth or direct attack by calling in friendlies to help in battles or capturing outposts. I definitely used stealth for most of the outposts and missions because stealth makes the game become more puzzle-like and methodical (unless you cheese outposts by taking out all alarms and enemies with a suppressed sniper from a distance, yawn) you also get more rewards/unlockables for clearing outposts and certain missions undetected or with no alarms triggered. I played on normal difficulty, which was probably why going in guns blazing to outposts was stupid easy most times. The enemy AI when in-combat is definitely way easier to deal with than when trying to stay undetected, they rarely push your position or flush you out of cover unless they have somewhat line-of-sight, and when they do, the enemy callout system makes their tactics pretty easy to counter. I don't know if AI difficulty scales with your game difficulty setting either. I definitely prefer the combat of this game to FC3 however, as it is literally just an improved version of it.

[h3] The Completionist Grind [/h3]
One last thing to mention is i'm 50/50 on going for 100% on this game. I did it and it took around 70 hours to do, and the second act of the game I was speedrunning everything that wasn't part of the main story. 100%ing this game, like all Far Cry games, is sort of a collectathon, but also the side mission structure is one of a few missions but in different locations. A lot of elements of this game don't count towards the ingame completion percentage thankfully, but a lot of them you do cause you can along the way, or because the game doesn't feel complete without doing them (discover all locations, loot all lootables, getting gold in all races, etc.).

You also have the arena, which again most of it doesn't count towards the ingame percentage, but the weapon challenges have a star system that feels incomplete if you don't get 5 stars on all weapons (which btw is 39 weapons. Not all weapons in the game but most of them). This isn't hard at all, most weapons I got 5 stars first try, but the arena is definitely the most grindy part of the game. I still enjoyed most of it even when I figured out the formula of it (manipulate enemy spawn locations, get a few chain takedowns to reach 800 points, then play defensive the rest of the 5 rounds, repeat). Mopping up the rest of what I needed to do for 100% was the only time I actually ever used the syringe system, and I only used the focus syringes for the speed boost. If you're a completionist like me, do it if you want, but if you think the grind is too long and boring I don't blame you, I stretched this playthrough out over a couple of months so I didn't get burnt out on it.

The story starts out amazing. Pagan Min is a really cool villain and I like how as the game progresses it starts to just seem like you're replacing one dictatorship with another. It's kind of open ended which is cool. The actual game world is the star of the show, as you're in a Phillipines-style fictional country called Kyrat which is full of all kinds of things to do and see. The thing I love about all the open world Far Cry games is that as you're going to explore one area you will often encounter some kind of side quest or activity that leads you somewhere else entirely. This game looks great and while it's full of mountainous terrain it's much easier to explore than most games that have this sort of elevated landscape.

The combat is just too easy, though. If you capture all the radio towers (which isn't hard to do) you can unlock a weapon that obliterates everything in just a couple shots. While it's nice to have overpowered weapons, most of the game's combat is a joke. If you take out the alarms during the outpost capture sequences you have just ten enemies or so to kill. You can see the enemies through the walls if you use a certain item that's easy to obtain, so you always have the upper hand in almost every combat situation.

Some of the side quests are challenging, however. There's this whole side event where you play as an ancient warrior in Shangri-La which is one of the coolest sequences I've ever seen in a Far Cry game. And it's hard. I wish the whole game was this hard because these were my favorite parts about the game.

Beyond that there's always some calamity going on and the game world is very active. Most of the animals in this game are very hostile and you will often see random NPCs fighting each other, like a bear eating a deer or two bears fighting each other, or civilians being attacked by the bears. The game has a 'karma' system and I'm not sure what it even does but it's very easy to get to the highest karma level just by 100% completing the game. There's ton of other stuff too- races, an arena, hunting side quests, assassination side quests. The stealth sequences where the game ends if you are detected are actually kind of challenging and have a puzzle element.

I 100% completed this game in about 30 hours so it's the perfect length, too. I would say this, Far Cry 3 and the original Far Cry are probably the best Far Cry games in the bunch. It's amazing how they immerse you in the world and really get you invested in the story and its characters. It's unfortunate that the story at the end just ends, as I would've liked maybe 2-3 more hours of chasing Pagan Min and an actual climax where you have to make a decision to kill him after some great effort.",1706965482,1706965482,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Game crashed only 2 times, but I managed to fix, altho I forgot what settings I changed. Loading times in fast travel were superb and I could always jump back into action after restocking on ammo, or doing side missions and gathering things. One thing I always loved from Far Cry 3 and 4 is the grenade ticking, knowing how to properly cook your grenade gives you power to destroy enemies with a couple of nades. I've taken whole outposts and beaten missions with grenades only. Now, for the game itself..

Not THAT bad. A very long review and impressions of the story and characters ahead.

After playing Far Cry 3 and falling in love with the story and the setting, I quickly bought Far Cry 4, anticipating a similar experience, however some things fall short in comparison to 3. The characters were so boring or annoying, that I barely cared for them. Even your protagonist, Ajay Ghale is not that refined. The most annoying characters are the radio host who never seems to shut up when driving a vehicle, and talks, and im not kidding, only about shit and hygiene. To be in the middle of a gunfight and having to listen to this fuck talk is psychological torture, I had to bind my key to mute the radio  to my mouse to mute the radio upon vehicle use. THAT'S HOW BAD IT WAS.

The most memorable characters that I will actually remember, are Mumu Chiffon, Longinus and Pagan Min. 

Mumu Chiffon, altho feminine and your typical Art Diva, actually had good dialogue. I was dissapointed at how the story somehow ended with him tho, as I was expecting an event that the devs maybe took out during the work on the game..

Longinus is a smuggler, murderer and supplier of tools and weapons for both you and the Golden Path. His missions are very important when it comes to upgrades, and he offered decent side quests. His redemption arc from his past was sympathetic, and his gift for your last mission is a decent weapon. I wish I saw more of him however..

Pagan Min is by far one of the most charismatic and likeable villains in the whole game. This guy is a literal dictator and I ended up liking him and his conversations and interactions more than the so called Golden Path allies, who only know how to disagree with each other and send you on missions. Every time that I was close to talking to Min I felt excitement as I knew that things would become somewhat interesting. In the end I shot him however, and I regret that decision. 

I did not care about Noore, I give two shits to Sabal and Amita, and dont care about the Golden Path AT ALL. During my gameplay it felt like I was helping a cult..

Not to make this review any longer now: Don't expect anything interesting from Far Cry 5. Far Cry 4 is the last decent game in the series.",1706956668,1706956668,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you've played Far Cry 3 I'm sure you've noticed that the movement and physics are the exact same.
This isn't necessarily bad, considering that I personally much prefer this movement system compared to the newer titles (*cough* *cough* Far Cry 6) The skill tree is now split into two trees (The Elephant and The Tiger) instead of the original three. (The Heron, The Shark and The Spider) 

Some skills only unlock after beating certain missions, or side activities. This *can* be a bit drag doing the same missions over and over but it's more than doable

This Far Cry title was the first to introduce open-world Co-Op, where one player plays as Ajay while the other plays as Hurk.
Sadly, when playing Co-Op all story missions are locked until your Co-Op partner leaves. And progression (Outposts and Side Activities) will only save for the host. (Ajay)

This game also features a 5v5 multiplayer mode. However, you very often won't find lobbies due to not many people knowing about this mode. (You can access it in the 'Chronicles' tab in the main menu. ""Battles of Kyrat"")

Forget Nepal, Kyrat's where it's at: snow-capped peaks, roaring elephants, and a dictator named Pagan Min whose fashion sense screams ""dictator chic, but with extra explosions."" You're Ajay Ghale, tourist turned freedom fighter, tasked with liberating this tropical paradise from Min's reign of, well, colorful tyranny.

Story? Bonkers, mate. Pagan's a villain so gloriously over-the-top, he makes Bond villains look like toddlers playing dress-up. Expect flamboyant speeches, psychotic sidekicks, and enough twists to leave you dizzy like a yak on Red Bull. The supporting cast? Just as wild, from rebel leaders with questionable hygiene to honey badgers (seriously, those things are terrifying).

Gameplay? Chaos in a box. Shoot, stab, grapple, ride elephants into enemy strongholds – the options are as varied as the wildlife (tigers, eagles, the occasional exploding yak...you get the picture). Need a sniper perch? Grapple hook to the top of a radio tower. Out of ammo? Throw a grenade of dubious origins. Kyrat's your playground, and the only rule is: ""have fun, don't get eaten by a honey badger.""

The world? Breathtaking (literally, the air's thin up here). From lush valleys to ancient temples, Kyrat's a postcard come to life, except everyone's got guns and a questionable moral compass. You'll spend hours just exploring, hunting mythical beasts, and discovering hidden shrines while wondering why your travel agent never mentioned this place (probably the exploding yaks).

So, perfect? Nah, mate. Bugs bigger than Pagan Min's ego, driving like a yak on roller skates, and a story that occasionally gets lost in the explosions. But here's the rub: Far Cry 4 is pure, unadulterated fun. It's a Himalayan fever dream with more laughs than a grenade factory and enough chaos to make a dictator blush. So grab your grappling hook, channel your inner action hero, and get ready for the wildest vacation ever. Just remember, in Kyrat, the only guaranteed souvenir is a tantrum from Pagan Min (and maybe a yak stampede).

P.S. Special thanks to my trusty AI co-pilot, Bard. They may not know how to ride an elephant, but their knowledge of Kyrat lore is deeper than a Himalayan yeti's beard. Plus, they kept me from writing the entire review in Nepali (my language skills are about as sharp as a butter knife). So yeah, give that AI some love too. Maybe a few extra rupees or a shiny new algorithm upgrade. They deserve it.

Now go forth, liberate Kyrat, and try not to get eaten by a honey badger.

Released nearly 10 years ago, Far Cry 4 was one of my favorite open-world adventure as an early teenager. I went back to rediscover the magic I once felt while playing this title, and even though my experience was decent, there's a lot of tedious downsides that were hidden deep behind nostalgia that resurfaced as an adult. Far Cry 4 isn't a bad game at all, and I still recommend it if you're into the formula, but it isn't an ''incredible'' game per se, and here's why:

[b] Pros [/b]
[list]
[*] The game still looks great even when compared to more recent games. The graphics are realistic, the environment feels alive.
[*] The gameplay has improved a lot from the previous titles. The gunplay feels good, the stealth is mostly fun, hunting is always a nice addition, the wingsuit and vehicules are somewhat challenging to use, all of which I enjoyed. The perk system is simple yet efficient. The bell tower system didn't bother me at all, unlike some. [/list]

[b] Neutrals [/b]
[list]
[*] The story is okay. Pagan is an incredible antagonist, and your involvment with the Golden Path will leave you questionning your choices at the very end of the story, but the side characters are definitely annoying, and Ajay is too close to a silent protagonist for a world that screams for a narrator. A lot of the main missions were also underwhelming.
[*] The level design is somewhat decent, but there wasn't enough variety between environments, unlike Far Cry Primal for example. It felt like there was no rememberable places in the world. The map itself isn't so much of a problem, I liked the fact that the North was separated from the South, but while exploring the world, the amount of tiny hills you cannot climb since they are a little too steep bothered me a lot.
[*] The game length is respectable, it took me around 40 hours to fully complete it, yet it felt like the vast majority of it was done picking up collectibles, which I find to be a sad excuse for bigger game length. The only reason I'm putting it in [i] Neutrals [/i] is because apart for one weapon and driving all the vehicules, fully completing this game was a fun overall experience, even though certainly flawed. The side missions also got boring towards the end of the game, thanks to their excessive repetiveness.
[*] Just like the other entries in the franchise, the AI can sometimes leave a bitter taste in the mouth. On the highest difficulties, an enemy can be completely blind from a certain angle, yet another can spot you easily from a mile away, while you're behind cover. This is mostly why stealth was frustrating on some occasions, because it was inconsistent. It isn't a major complaint, but it could have been a bit better. The NPC AIs are just plain stupid, though. [/list]

[b] Cons [/b]
[list]
[*] I don't know if it's the DUNIA engine that is terrible, or if it's just because it's an older game, but it runs like shit. I have a high-end PC rig, and I'm always stuck between 50-70fps, no matter how much I lower the graphics, I barely gain any performances. Wished I could at least experience the whole thing in VSync 60 fps, but that won't even do.
[*] The game is filled with bugs. I encountered several crashes that made me lose a decent amount of progression. I glitched through walls, wasn't able to climb surfaces that indicate clearly they can be climbed, the wingsuit hitbox is awful, etc. And the bugs aren't just minor visual/audio problems, they can definitely influence the outcome of a mission on a lot of occasion. The FOV reseted on many occasions, and the only way to get it back to your liking is to enter a door or to die. It was extremely painful to deal with all of it. [/list]

[b] TL;DR [/b] It pains me to say that this game is overshadowed by awful performance and stability, and since the campaign is weaker than Far Cry 3's, I get why a lot of people won't enjoy this game. I still liked it for what it was, a good open-world with fun gameplay, great graphics, and enjoyable exploration, even though it definitely has its downsides. Long live Pagan Min!

The story is good too, but I think a lot of the Far Cry 4 experience is made possible by Kyrat, the map is insane and a lot of fun to explore. The map really fascinates me, and I think Ubisoft should go back to its roots and try to produce a map with the same feel as Far Cry 4, and just as beautiful, bringing in aspects of the Nepalese Himalayas, which are very present in Kyrat. But despite all this, Ajay Ghale could have had more personality.

What’s this game about? It’s simply about a son who wants to fulfill his mother’s last wish. The journey to Kyrat began. You have to fight all the way there and learn the truth. Along the way you have to decide who you want to side with. There are only 2 leaders to choose from based on your preference or play style. They’ll be the future of Kyrat.

What I enjoyed from the game :

1.	I like the atmosphere. It’s truly outstanding with realistic vegetative and animals. Sometimes I just want to sit and relax and enjoy the view.
2.	The world is full of activities. You might find this a little bit unnecessary, but in my opinion, this is what makes the open-world aspect lively and immersive.
3.	The mechanics are easy to understand but need some time to learn.
4.	Weapon choices are plentiful. Pocket grenade launcher is the most op in my opinion. It’s sidearm (usable while driving) and also deals lots of damage.
5.	I like the sneak kill aspect. I know that you can just blast outpost all at once, but I enjoyed sneaking more.
6.	Economy is relatively balance not too grindy.
7.	Most of the syringe boosts are useful. Especially hunting syringe, which I used the most.
8.	Movement is fluid. It feels like you are there to do everything.
9.	Story is interesting. For those who already completed the game, there is a secret ending that is super interesting and worth checking out.

In between love and hate :

1.	Animals' spawn rates are often too rapid. This sometimes ruins your mission. E.g eagle can kill you randomly, while you don’t look at the sky often. Remember to kill predators when possible or just run away.
2.	Some mission is a drag and feels repetitive. The part I like about that mission is the reward it gave. Worth the struggle.
3.	Crafting aspect is not well made. You have to collect animal’s skins to upgrade yourself. I think there is a better way to do that, maybe buy a new one from the store. Or obtain it through another region or heck maybe give it minigames. What I like about this is I get to interact more with the world to find animal to skin.

What I hate about the game :

1.	Ubisoft Connect. I hate it because I have to fire up Steam and then have to wait a long loading to open Ubisoft Connect. Most of the time they displayed error syncing. It’s frustrating.
2.	Easy to normal difficulty is too easy and hard difficulty is annoying. While AI works the worst on difficulty below hard, it’s the most balanced experience. In hard, enemies are dealing more damage and more accurately hitting you, even from far away.
3.	Some bugs lead you to a soft lock state. This means you no longer can progress the game except to restart from the checkpoint. Don’t worry it’s not that often.

Summary :

I think this game is still worth trying, even though this game was released in 2014. If you like a shooter with an open world aspect, this game is for you.",1705501165,1705501308,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The central plot of attempting to deliver your mother's ashes opens up into a story explaining much about the Ajay as well as the antagonist, Pagan Min.  Pagan Min is easily one of the most memorable villians EVER.  While Vaas gets the nod from many FarCry fans, I think Pagan Min beats him in most aspects.

по сути это прокаченная версия Far cry 3, которая для своего времени была неплоха и игралась прям на ура.
Здесь мир побольше, пушки поинтереснее, но это максимум... Сюжет какой-то ультра всратый, персонажи ни о чем, самые веселые и/или интересные задания от 2 нариков, которые в тебя тычут шприцом... даже я задушился и не стал зачищать карту до конца, потому что стало скучно.

В теории взять на огромной скидке базовую версию можно( не берите DLC, они бесполезные, я протупил)

At the time of playing FC3 I had already played FC5 and noticed that Ubisoft apparently found a formula for commercial success in FC3. This lead them down the Call Of Duty route of re-releasing (more or less) the same game. It's a shame. Far Cry 1 had mutant monkeys, Far Cry 2 innovated with their physics engine; bringing fire and moderate destruction to the game. Far Cry 3 was a proper open world game with interesting themes and antagonist-centered gameplay. It's a shame that the pace of innovation reduced. 

My primary gripe with this game is the artificially large world which is filled with repeatable quests. Their only relevance to the game in general is that certain signature weapons and skills are locked behind them. 

The karma events are better. While essentially repeating content as well, they happen pseudo-randomly [i] and at your current location [/i] instead of requiring considerable boring travel in an empty world. In one way, they are the only life in a mostly dead world.

BUT - the campaign is very good. The facial animations, the characters, the story and the cutscenes are all very engaging. It's full of difficult decisions and interesting characters that is it is worthwhile to learn more about. Pagan Min in particular reminded me of Handsome Jack, which is high praise.

As a sandbox single player game, it's fine. It can't compete with games like The Witcher or Red Dead Redemption, but it's not a bad game by any means. There's a lot to enjoy, so I give the game my recommendation.",1704806314,1704806314,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

FC4 gets some flak for basically copying FC3 in a different setting. The game only had about a year in development so the devs cut as many corners as they could. The game looks good, but not much better than FC3. FC4 retains many of the same elements as FC3 and doesn't push the boundaries to much. In many ways, however, this is a good thing. The game basically takes everything from FC3 and dials it up to 11. FC3 was a great game so you get a lot of the same elements but in a new, bigger setting.

The story isn't amazing but I liked it. I think it's better than FC3's story. It tries to add even more nuance and gray morality than FC3, although it doesn't always do a good job of showing that. Unlike newer games, FC4 has a good mix of serious and silly missions. The game has the best pacing out of any FC game. Instead of opening up the whole map at the start and letting you choose which missions to do when, the game tries to funnel you in a certain direction. You literally start on one side of the map and work your way up. I really like this. I can feel the progression of the story and myself as a player as I gain more and more territory.

The games difficulty is well balanced. I didn't feel to strong or weak even on the hardest difficulty. The AI is very stupid but you don't have a ton of OP weapons like newer entries. There are some annoying aspects though. The animals, especially the birds, are very annoying to deal with. Also, the game does have some annoying bugs like misplaced location makers. One of those is actually under the map but you can still get to it if you want to 100% the game.

The Yeti DLC is very mid and totally skippable. It had some fun moments but felt kinda tedious.",1704773623,1704773623,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

* **A World Alive:** Kyrat isn't just a backdrop; it's a vibrant, teeming ecosystem. Lush jungles crawl with exotic wildlife, ancient ruins whisper forgotten secrets, and snow-capped peaks pierce the sky. You'll grapple through temples, ride elephants into chaotic firefights, and encounter everything from honey badgers to cultists with flamethrowers.

* **Unforgettable Villains:** Pagan Min, the despotic ruler, is deliciously deranged. His flamboyant unpredictability makes him as captivating as he is hateable. His lieutenants, each with their own quirks and agendas, add a layer of twisted depth to the narrative.

* **Mayhem in Paradise:** Far Cry's sandbox freedom reigns supreme. Whether you're sniping enemies from a distance, setting up elaborate traps, or riding a gyrocopter into a propaganda tower, the possibilities for open-world chaos are endless. The grappling hook adds a new layer of verticality, letting you scale cliffs and ambush outposts from unexpected angles.

**Valley of the Yetis: Where Myth Meets Mayhem**



* **Himalayan Chill:** Valley of the Yetis throws you into an icy wasteland straight out of a yeti legend. The desolate beauty of the snow-capped peaks, treacherous ice bridges, and hidden yeti caves creates a unique and suspenseful atmosphere.

* **Face the Beast:** The yetis are more than just furry punching bags. They're intelligent, adaptable, and will stalk you through the blizzard, demanding respect and cunning strategies to defeat.

* **Radioactive Rumble:** Defend your radio outpost against waves of Pagan Min's forces and yeti attacks. The mix of human and mythical enemies keeps you on your toes, forcing you to adapt your tactics and defenses on the fly.

**Together, Far Cry 4 and Valley of the Yetis offer an unforgettable open-world adventure full of explosive action, quirky characters, and breathtaking landscapes. It's a playground for mayhem, a descent into madness, and a chilling encounter with the legends of the Himalayas. So, grab your grappling hook, fire up your gyrocopter, and get ready to paint Kyrat red (and white) in this epic saga of revolution and yetis!**

Remember, this is just the tip of the iceberg. Kyrat and the Himalayas hold countless secrets and stories waiting to be discovered. So, dive into the adventure, embrace the chaos, and let me know what your favorite moments are!

The biggest difference regarding mechanics is the mission. One issue I have with the predecessor is there is not much to do besides the main quests. Far Cry 4 makes it up by introducing many more side quests and activities, adding around 20+ hours of playtime if you decide to do all of them. Apart from that, there is no perceivable difference that worth talking about. You can see that the success of Far Cry 4 is pretty much a guarantee because the predecessor sells well, so if you like Far Cry 3, you will find this one interesting as well. 

Like its predecessor, Far Cry 4 offers diverse gameplay. You can choose to go straight up gun blazing, or stealth, or snipping or whatever depending on how you want to play, with its wide range of different weapons. It is not only a decent shooter but also a great stealth and snipping game. The only complaint I have is the weapon customized parts are not differentiated enough. But that does not hurt the gameplay much.

Far Cry franchise always has great stories on a universal theme about how a person deviates from his original path. I first played the game in my adolescence, all I saw was this universal theme and nothing else. But this time when I played it again, I saw much more nuance that its predecessor doesn’t have. The story has more touch on the grey zone of humanity. Characters in the game, no matter the villains, Paul, Noore, Yuma, Pagan, or the heroes, Ajay, Sabal, Amita, Ajay’s father, all have complex personalities. To define what they do is either horrible or noble is just a matter of perspective and there is no definitive black and white. This complexity makes the story intriguing and really sets me thinking. But that being said, the story is not perfect. Most motivations of characters are understandable, but some really don’t hold up. Particularly, the script is sloppy about the character development of Ajay, the protagonist. Ajay just does whatever he is asked to do like a puppet without thoughts. Lacking manifestation of his thoughts and motivations hurt the story. 

As an open-world game, it is very mechanical, just running around doing repetitive stuff. It cannot compare to true open-world masterpieces like The Witcher or The Elder Scrolls. But the diverse sandbox gameplay and the diversified environment that is nice to explore redeem itself a lot, so as a matter of fact, I like it a lot, and in my opinion, it is pretty much the best open-world Ubisoft can construct for being just a little repetitive but not truly annoyingly grindy like some recent installments.

It’s like Far Cry 3, but with better graphics, more immersion, improved gunplay, more realistic and interactive animals, and interesting characters.

Unfortunately, this game represents the pinnacle of what the Far Cry series had to offer, as all the games after Far Cry 4 have progressively deteriorated, with Far Cry 6 being the most generic, repetitive, and dull game ever, accompanied by its worst characters that you don’t even feel compelled to save from the villain. I purposely mentioned Far Cry 6 here so that you don’t waste your money on it after reading the reviews of Far Cry fanboys.

If you want to experience the best Far Cry game, then you should definitely buy this one… and if you are Indian, then you are going to love this game even more as you would understand every word the NPCs around you chatter (which is in Hindi), and our culture is nicely portrayed, making the game very immersive and unique.

Far Cry 4 is a huge game that took me a good 80 hours to complete, and I thoroughly enjoyed every second. The graphics were outstanding and everything felt smooth and optimised. Music and sound design were really well done and the animals and NPCs in this game really made Kyrat feel alive and immersive.

The game builds off of Far Cry 3, and improves alot of the annoyances I had with that game. Driving is now more enjoyable, the combat felt really satisfying with all the variety of weapons. Grappling up cliffs and mountains was a nice addition, elephant riding was great, and all the side missions felt varied and never got boring, especially Shangri-La and Hurk missions. Main story was really good aswell.

My only criticisms are it's a little too combat-heavy at times, it would have been nice to relax a little and explore but you are constantly on edge with all the animals and enemy patrols. I did have a couple of crashes, and a few bugs and glitches but that is to be expected with a game this size.

Overall, my favourite Far Cry game so far, very immersive, tons of content and so much fun to play.

Pagan Min is easily one of the [b] best villains [/b] I've ever come across. Charming, funny, one of the greatest reasons you should try this game. Finished the game at 100% completion after a little over 91 hours, including all its DLCs. It was so much fun. The landscape can feel challenging as it's set in the Himalayas, but this is right up your alley if you're like me and enjoy exploration and the feeling of satisfaction after scaling a mountain or tower. Breathtaking views. Beautiful environments. Made me wanna visit Nepal someday (minus the hallucinogens and insurgency).

Being able to use [b] elephants [/b] (as vehicles, weapons, and personal companions) in this game is probably the most fun I've ever had in a game this year.

Similar to its predecessors, there is no single way to play FarCry. In my case, I loved the satisfaction using the bow gave me and I played stealthily (though this approach did often give more XP when clearing settlements). Have a blast!

Where do I even begin! This review is going to be a little biased due to my unending love for Himalayas and its mythologies. I remember few years back traveling to the remote areas in the Himalayas via Himachal or Uttarakhand or Nepal every now and then to know more about the stories that remain hidden and the good stuff you find there :D

This game comes closer than anything that could satiate me in my quest to find the truths i hope to find one day irl. Be it YETI's or the trippy psychedelics you find there and imagine how the trip would be or the wildlife or the majestic mountains or local fauna and herbs or the cultural appropriation or shanath or Shangri-La or storyy. It owned me overwhelmingly. The breathtaking visuals, stunning views, The cultural representation, relatability factor, insane game mechanics, living up to my expectations, good stuff :D, this game has it all. 

I have completed it many times during the early years of its launch pirated, on a POTATO pc, but then had the privilege to purchase it on steam and do it all over again and this time on a fairly overkill machinery. Needless to mention, again it took my breath away. I remember in the end there comes a time in the tavern where you place the urn which has the ashes of your mother and place it in lakshmana, only to find out that lakshmana is not a place but your sister.

I can highly recommend it, but I have to say, for me personally, it isn't as good as Far Cry 3 or Far Cry 5. Both of the latter have much better villains and a much better story, AFAIC. The ending isn't as epic as that in Far Cry 3 (it was the first one of the series I played; perhaps I'm biased) and there aren't as many interesting ""sub-bosses"" as in Far Cry 5. Still, there are some moral choices to make and the game mechanics (with lots of unscripted chaos ensuing) prove to be super enjoyable once again. 

Kudos to the sound designers, the soundtrack producers (Indian music on the radio), the script writer for the radio announcers, and most of all to the voice actor of the radio announcer. Grammy-worthy performance!

A minor issue is that enemies and animals can be formidable bullet sponges. It does not feel right how they absorb a lot of lead without being affected. Later on, when one assumes better weapons, the problem is mitigated.

The least remarkable is probably the music, it suits the setting of the game and overall isn't miserable to listen to so I'll take it

Gun play is extremely smooth, every weapon feels viable for most of the game. The grenade launcher is so good it hurts me to ever get rid of it. When possible, it will be added to my inventory and hopefully never leave. It is your workhorse of the game and makes everything extremely pleasurable. This doesn't detract from the other guns of course but it simply is perfect.

Game looks, fine. There's an asterisk there because it looks older than modern games but it's completely acceptable for what it is. Characters have good detail, the world looks great, and I didn't have many visual bugs so that's OK. 

Story is fine, at least you get a choice in a lot of options even if there's really only 2 endings. I mean, there's technically 4 but uh, 2 of them are gag endings so no.

I 100% this game and the racing by far is the worst part of optional events, they don't quite work when random events can interrupt them frequently. 

Grappling in this game is extremely broken, often throwing you cliffs or glitching you through the earth. Very frustrating overall. Also using the wing suit is amazing until you pull the parachute and the game immediately kills you. I mean they fixed it in new dawn but not here so bad game design. 

Ajay is fine, he's suitable for his role. Weird that within 15 minutes of coming to the country he's fine with shooting armed military members and joining a bunch of terrorists but uh, oh well skip that who cares.

As always there will be a point while playing a far cry game stops being fun and simply becomes an endurance test to complete and that's probably gonna be around the last 2 outposts but the game will pull it around for the final mission so that's ok when the ending is an extremely good time 20 minutes later. 

Also everyone in this game, including Ajay himself are terrible people who consistently make awful decisions so you won't really be routing for anyone besides yourself, even though the golden path are supposed to be the good guys their leaders are both power hungry bastards that will stab each other in the back continuously along the path to freedom so that's pretty telling even though their fighting for freedom.

Also playing with a friend doesn't allow their game to progress which not only holds back their world but also the guns and skills they can unlock which is awful game design. I really wish this would go away.

Now, normally I reserve the end for going overall general feelings of the game, however it will instead be reserved for THE WORST STEALTH MISSION IN A GAME I'VE PLAYED IN QUITE SOME TIME. WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?! THIS GAME IS A RUN AND GUN GAME, WHY WOULD YOU BREAK THE GAMES AMAZING PACING FOR SHITTY STEALTH SECTIONS? One is almost completely unplayable without first abandoning the mission and then approaching it from the complete opposite side of the compound, which is not the intended design because it auto spawns you near the gate entrance when you die and respawn so they obviously want you to begin there but that side is complete shit so why would it put me there? I'm just gonna spawn in front of 6 guys and one of them is bound to see me because the loading screen sets me in their view right away? Maybe a bug I noticed because I don't see this anywhere else but it completely shifted my viewpoint on how I feel about stealth in this game because it completely ruined the mood of the game for the hour I spent there. 

If you want a score it's getting an 8/10 for being enjoyable for about 80% of the entire game. Just some really, REALLY, stinker sections. ""As long as you're shooting, you're winning son""",1703812009,1703812009,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It's a well made game. All the mechanics are solid. I haven't hit any bugs or even any inconsequential jankiness. 

I just feel like I'm going through the motions already and I'm only 25 hrs in.

I was really excited about the hunting and skin gathering. Then it just became drop bait, predator instantly rushes in, a couple shotgun blasts to the face, gather skin and bait, repeat. There's no tracking or stalking unless you impose limits on yourself. Killing animals with your bow or knife will yield double the skins but it's way faster to just drop bait and shotgun blasts them for the single skin because you can complete that cycle in 4 or 5 seconds. That's really not an exaggeration at all.

The injections are a cool idea but there are very few herbs. Green, Yellow, Red, Blue, Purple, and White. Green gives you the HP injections and the other 3 injections are a combination of two of the other herbs. I honestly don't feel like I ever need them except the HP ones. The one that tracks all wildlife and enemies around you is very useful but it makes much of the game trivial.

I really like the bow to stealthily take over an outpost! I would set up on the highest point I could find near the outpost and use the camera to tag enemies and spot the alarm boxes. I'd usually have to find different vantage points to get a good understanding of the enemies present and where the alarms are located. Then I'd get close and snipe one or two enemies before racing off to another hiding place and picking off more. It is a really fun way to take over a place.

However, it becomes stale and you can simply fire multiple RPGs at them and snipe with a gun or run in with damage reduction injections, all enemies tagged, faster run (with auto-dodge) and wreck the place.

It's one of those games I feel like I should love but it's a slog at best. 

Looting enemies and chests will give money or literal vendor fodder. So, just money. I can't spend it fast enough. It's entirely meaningless.

The collectable are very basic. The masks are sort of neat. A marked area will show up near you and you need to follow the sound to find the mask and destroy it. Sadly, it's really boring too. The grappling hook is actually pretty cool with some neat physics-based swinging. Like most of the mechanics, though, it get's old really quickly. I feel no real incentive to explore.

The skills are nothing new but not the most basic I've seen. The ""trees"" are actually just ~10 linear paths with 5 skills each (most are passives). I have skill points into a bunch of stuff I never use because the 3rd or 4th node is actually something I want. For the most part, I don't have anything I want to invest in. 

I paid <$10 CDN so I don't feel like I got ripped off. I just don't feel compelled to keep playing.

This game is communism: It works great on paper but in reality the experience falls apart pretty quickly.

If you're thinking about purchasing this game off a sale or something for the generous price of 3-10 bucks, here's a piece of advice for you. Fucking don't.
They should be paying you money to sit through this dogshit garbage fire.

This game is so broken you literally cannot finish it without resorting to glitches and bugs (Unless you want the ""secret"" ending). And if you're into exploring and collecting everything in the game (You know, as you're supposed to in Farcry), you're in for a really bad time. It's doubtful they were to patch anything at this point in time, too.
And no, I'm not just talking about ""The Underwater Truck""-incident.

Many of the mechanics within the game such as running, jumping, climbing, grappling hook, windsuit, parachute and driving a vehicle are straight up broken. And they are mandatory to completing the game.
There's invisible walls everywhere that'll make you crash mid-air when gliding or driving a car. 
The hitboxes of trees and branches do not reflect the visual cues of the game.
I genuinely cannot stress the amount of badly optimized assets in the game that are simply invisible blocks to prevent your passage. Windsuiting down a mountain is like a coinflip between life and death, unless you fancy parachuting like IRL.
Clipping through obstacles, walls, floors, boxes happens a lot. Sometimes you may even fall out of the map altogether.
None of the vehicles save for one feel good to drive or are responsive enough to be used within the mountains where this game takes place in. Unless you're planning to drive like your blind, asian grandma.
Genuinely there's only 1 vehicle in the game that feels even remotely acceptable outside of main roads, that being the quad-bike/buggy or whatever the fuck.
I get the impression that travelling in this game was designed by a disabled, satanic slug that wants everyone to be even more crippled than he is. Simply out of spite.
""Oh man, but there's helicopters in the game. You can just fly."" 
Yeah, just wait until you accidentally ascend 10CM above the ground and the motor gives up, sending you crashing down to the ground. 

Repetitive sidequests that are all the same thing over and over again remain the blight of Ubisoft.
Much like the Shanath Arena, that forces you to reach rank 10 in order to unlock all guns. 
The Arena is a cheap and trivialized version of the combat in the game where you're encouraged to stay engaged for several hours at a time, yet every arena match feels, is, and plays out as the exact same.
Especially after you figure out how to abuse the infinitely spawning medpacks.
""Oh man, but you can connect your mobile app into it and then...""
Yeah no- fuck off. Literally stop breathing.

I reckon whomever wrote the story thought it's ""oh so deep"" as everything ends the same way it starts. Woah, so cool it's like a circle of life and death bro woah damn. Maybe the real farcry 4 was the journey we had along the way.

As a proud owner of the season pass, I am choosing to completely ignore both DLCs and additional content after experiencing the main game. It truly is a blessing to put this sad excuse of a videogame behind me.
I had to quit and start this game on 3 separate occasions, as it was just too terrible for me to bear in one go. Just play Farcry 3 instead. Or better yet, play anything except this.

The Shangri-La sequences were genuinely cool and well done, perchance holding more significant spiritual implications than the ones in 3 and 5. Truly awesome.

Game always in window when booted up, have to change it to full-screen every time.




My first thought playing Far Cry 4 was ""Oh I like this"".
Second was ""Wait you can ride an elephant?!""
Third was ""Hell yeah, I'm riding a a fucking elephant!!!""

Far Cry 4 is very similar to Far Cry 3 yet manages to surpass it with characters that are more compelling, and with a villain you actually like. As in, you'd actually want to get a beer with him and just hang out. He is so damn likable.

Far Cry 4 is in my opinion better than 3 hands down. Better music, better sights, better characters, it has it all.

Also I got to mention the first person driving is so good! All the vehicles in this game have such character and life to them! The empty cans that roll around to the soft sway of the hanging tassels just makes driving such an enjoyable experience.",1702788819,1702788819,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game was advertised as having single player content. But it requires you to connect to their servers even if you are not playing online. 

What does this have to do with this game? Well it means that all of their games moving forward are potentially just long term rentals that are not advertised as such. This is a very anti-consumer practice. And I cannot in good conscience recommend any games from this publisher when that has the potential to happen to any buyer. Ubisoft could patch these games to remove the online requirement. But they're choosing not to. So that makes their products a very poor value proposition in my opinion.

Review is after 100% completion of the main game, Escape from Durgesh Prison and 100% completion of Valley of the Yetis DLC. Obtained all single player achievements except the 4 co-op and multiplayer achievements. It's vital to note that Ubisoft does [b]NOT[/b] respect you in  [b]ANY[/b] way for achieving 100%. No achievement to showcase, no in game reward, not even a pop-up saying congratulations. However, Ubisoft does force several co-op and multiplayer related achievements (dead now because the game released in 2014), that intentionally prohibit you from earning all achievements.

So why did I 100% this game? It was a mix of: the allure of Kyrat, the Ubisoft open world formulae, vibrant colour palette and lastly just to see if I could 100% a Ubisoft game.

[h3]The Good:[/h3]
[list]
[*]The initial momentum after being introduced into Kyrat helped me tackle the South Kyrat map with gusto.
[*]Interesting allied characters such as Amita, Longinus, Rana, Sabal, Willis. Their voice acting performances were of good quality.
[*]The main villain had 3 lieutenants with backstories and motivations.
[*]The main villain Pagan Min was constructed and presented remarkably well. Is he better than Vaas? Yes I think so, considering he lasts the entire game.
[*]The main highlights are the 5 Shangri La missions. The complete shift in the colour palette and the greater emphasis on stealth made for an incredible experience. The lore and the scenery were engrossing. There were many screenshot worthy vistas. The shift to a different language fit those missions very well. The peak of Far Cry 4’s game design here in my opinion.
[*]Arena missions were initially enjoyable and offered a variety of options.
[*]The Buzzer a.k.a Badass Mini Chopper. The ONLY efficient way to travel.
[*]Mini climbing puzzles for the tallest mountains.
[*]Wingsuit and parachute traversal.
[*]17 Bell tower puzzles and unlockable rewards for hijacking all of them.
[*]20 Lost Letters with their separate interesting story.
[*]20 Journals that add more to the history of the protagonist. Essential collectathon in my opinion.
[*]Adequate level of mystery surrounding the protagonist's past. The search for answers is a strong motivation to finish the game.
[*]Valley of the Yetis DLC allowed more playtime in the snowy Himalayas.
[*]While the grind to 100% was gruelling, it did feel worthwhile upon reaching the final 3 missions.
[*]100% completion progress tracker for completionists.
[/list]
[h3]The Bad:[/h3]
[list]
[*]The massive North Kyrat map eroded my motivation to complete the game. Simply no need for that area to be so large.
[*]At the 70% mark I was truly feeling the grind of the collectathon. I had maxed out levels, karma, skills and upgrades while rolling in rupees. The XP rewards and the karma boosts from the collectathon felt pointless due to this.
[*]Skills reducing bow sway and weapon reload speed and weapon switch speed did not feel impactful.
[*]Utterly despised all the drug missions as they always take away control from the player. No weapons, no skills, no syringes or utilities. Absolutely loathed seeing those mission icons on the map.
[*]Missed opportunity to add more ammo types for the recurve bow, e.g. tranquilliser, sleeping gas or smoke screen arrow heads.
[*]150 propaganda posters with only meagre rewards and no final grand reward.
[*]50 mani wheels spun while having max karma, to receive nothing special at the end.
[*]55 masks destroyed to receive only a serviceable reward. Honestly I only used that reward once. Moreover, there is no decisive conclusion to that mystery.
[*]Terrible end fight in the Shangri-La missions. Previous missions can be played in stealth; not the final battle. It's simply a boss + horde mode, with minimal cover and limited ammo.
[*]Sadistic of Ubisoft to lock a weapon (quite powerful) at Arena rank 10. That grind was mind numbing. I needed to muster all my dedication to grind for that.
[*]Escape from Durgesh Prison game mode felt pointless as it was a timed challenge gauntlet. Detested that timer.
[*]Valley of the Yetis DLC took away the protagonist’s guns; then asks that he search for them randomly lying around in the wilderness. All skills were force reset to 0, which I think is the greatest travesty. Since, In the main game I had unlocked the majority of skills prior to entering North Kyrat; therefore, it felt like a pointless chore to skill up yet again in the DLC.
[*]Regrettably the Valley of the Yetis DLC shattered my enjoyment of the game due to the repetitive grind to skill up (again) and obtain weapons and upgrades.
[*]Moreover, the DLC could have benefitted from adding snowstorms to the mix to reduce visibility and allow for stealth gameplay. Sadly a missed opportunity.
[/list]
[h3]The Advice:[/h3]
[list]
[*] [b]DO NOT[/b] play the alternate ending first. I made that mistake out of curiosity and it cost my excitement for the story. Not all mysteries are explained there, but my enjoyment of the story was diminished.
[*]Optimal and chronological order to play the game is: Main game till prison mission, Escape from Durgesh Prison DLC, Valley of the Yetis DLC, Main game till conclusion.
[*]From the beginning it's possible to work towards upgrading all equipment. Grind this out as much as possible as it provides varied options for gameplay.
[*]Snow leopard skins will be out of reach initially; however, there will be Himalayas missions. Once there, reach a vantage point, throw bait, kill any animals that are drawn to it, including snow leopards. Restock bait by looting killed animals. Farm as many skins as needed.
[*]Use the sidearm grenade launcher with the Buzzer to fly close to propaganda posters and grenade them.
[*]For the Mask collectathon throw Molotovs at the general area; the fire can burn the mask.
[*]The Arena grind for the final weapon is tougher now without the companion app. Try to finish it off in one game session.
[*]For the final Shangri-La fight, run straight to the stone sculptures surrounding the arena and hide from enemies and boss attacks. Keep moving along that rim to avoid fire attacks and fireballs. Snipe the boss using the special abilities. Pick up ammo quickly while the boss is temporarily down.
[*]The Survival races were unnecessarily challenging due to bugs with boarding the hovercraft. Enter, exit and enter again to get the hovercraft to move.
[*]Heavily pace yourself to 100% this game. At the 80% mark I just wanted to be done with the game. Even the vibrant Shangri-La missions appeared daunting.
[*]I can’t even imagine 100% completing the game after exhausting all story missions, as the grind is excruciating at times. As such, pace yourself on the story missions if attempting 100% completion.

Something like Pagan Min comes back to Kyrat, and is trying to take it over again from Ajay and the Golden Path. Since he had a clone of himself the first time Ajay killed him, he could reappear as having had another switch after Ajay comes to the end of deciding to kill Pagan, or let him go.

I don't think ubisoft tried their best to represent India/Nepal because there are tons of sign boards in devanagri and it's either random gibberish or transliterated english words lol , also the radio has tamil songs wtf? makes no sense at all , and the auto rickshaw has a steering wheel 0.0

the gameplay is not bad , it has animations like previous fc games like looting animation , skinning animation etc which was cut from farcry5 which i like, and the gun play is decent too 

and there r annoying bell towers which are very tedious to climb one by one it was annoying i hated it , but there is a trick you can use that helicopter to reach the top 

The missions in this game are not well designed there  r some missions where enemy keeps on spawning n u have no time to heal or reload lol

[spoiler] and yeah Pagan min wasn't the villain lol [/spoiler]

Conclusions ? idk i've a love and hate relationship with this game its very odd n weird idk what to say like.... i like how they represent indian /nepal culture its good to see , but at they same time they mixed up different things like adding random sht lol

I just expected so much from the beautiful trailers... *sobs*

GOOD:
- Story
- One of the best intros ever.
- Pagan Min. He's not as good as Vaas, but he's alright.
- The entire island, and the culture.
- Very good graphics
- Really good soundtracks
- Secrets. So far I've reached the within first 15 minutes to wait that triggered the secret ending
- Whole concept that ISN'T American. Finally, a game that isn't about USA! I'm sick and tired of games using everything about USA like maps, people, society, native English language and more. The songs, people, the culture. they're relaxing and peaceful with their religion around the island.
- Autodrive feature

BAD:
- Some animations are the same used from FC3
- Uplay
- Crap controls. Who the hell binds mouse wheel from weapon 
- Crashes
- Not optimized well. High end PC years ahead of game's technology and yet the game dips to 50 at ultra settings..
- Boring, repititve missions. Expect the snow mission, it's so good and it felt like playing Modern Warfare 2.
- Ubisoft lied to us that E3 gameplay was so much graphicaly better than the retail.
- Crap load of bugs. Including the fucking annoying draw distance fading. And the AI.. you cannot believe what I see in my eyes.
-10 seconds of damn logo startup vids
-Terrible stealth sections and AI
7/10

Surely enough I don't care if this gets 100 dislikes but I changed my mind and played it. It's relaxing. The one thing that isn't relaxing is fucking uplay. FUCKING UPLAY.

My only issue is that regardless of your choices you can't really chose how the story line goes, ends or continues once you complete the game.

Me personally I liked Pagan Min but you don't get a chance to hear him out or side with him.

I wouldn't mind that though if I got the option to Kill Sabal & Amita then side with Pagan because their just using you to obtain power & wanting to do the exact same things they are disgusted at Pagan doing. You can kill one but its just to side with the other. So stupid. 

Maybe Ajay Ghale is too brain dead and needs it spoon fed by Pagan to understand but, by the time you do the game is over, Pagan leaves indefinitely.

So what you should do to get it to open again is the following: First do Windows Key + R

Then Type in ""regedit""

Look for a folder starting with ""S-1-5-21-"" (It might have two folders with this name try checking both).

Software > Ubisoft > Far Cry 4

Delete the Far Cry 4 folder.

Close Registry Edit.

Try to open Far Cry 4 again. (Close everything and restart the PC first).

I also played the Valley of the Yetis DLc and after some time it started freezing and closing randomly through a cutscene when you encounter the first Yeti, but it solved itself after couple of tries, it worked smoothly again.

Far Cry 4 is possibly my favorite game series ever to come out.

I've played almost all the Far Cry series, but this one is probably my favorite (including Far Cry 3, where Vas was the main villain :D)

Even as a kid I played Far Cry 1 on my old pentium and enjoyed the relaxing game, but where Far Cry has reached today is really amazing how times change in this gaming world :)

As such the second + are the workshop maps which were absolutely luxurious and awesome. Thanks to the developers who participated in the creation of new maps. It brought another great feeling for players and dozens of extra hours of gameplay.

❌
- This game has multiplayer, which was completely worthless, but of course someone could enjoy it.

The DLC as a bonus also seemed unnecessary to me. They could have put it together with the game, but I understand that the company wanted to make as much money as possible for interesting DLC.",1618414347,1701374171,True,0,0,0,0,True,True,False

Vaas, Joseph Seed, Castillo… They are so charismatic that FOR THEM, you play the game. And the last one is so cool that many were willing to pay up to 70 bucks for zoomer crap just to meet him.

Now, what about the bleached blond guy? What can you remember about him?

Disclaimer: we're going to lay down the facts about Far Cry. It might get stuffy for the kids and the challenged ones. It's better to open a window for some fresh air right away.

ALL Ubisoft games of the last 10 years are built on one concept.

    They introduce you to your friends, show the enemy, show why he's bad.
    Then they throw you into a pit called ""Endless mini-missions in an open world to summon a boss.""

If it were a fantasy or Souls game, I would say, ""Well, it's an RPG, you have to level up.""

But is Far Cry an RPG? For those who are not aware, RPG implies a tabletop role-playing game, or as they say colloquially, a tabletop! If anyone's interested, go to YouTube and watch the evolution of RPG games.
And, of course, RPG doesn't just imply character leveling up, but a gradual advantage that you can gain through mini-duels, which will give you an edge by the end of the game!
Example? Any part of tabletop games where you can level up and break the face of another boss with one blow.
Correct, this is done for the serfs who heard the word RPG in the Dota chat one day. The second time when they were yelled at in Minecraft. And a day later, they went to Google to see what your RPG is, went to Steam, found Far Cry, and bought it on torrent trackers.

In other words, with this little flaw, the developers lowered the entry threshold (into your mom).

Now, what about Far Cry? Here RPG is for the sake of RPG, and missions for the sake of running time. Because of the impotence of the writers or laziness? - a rhetorical question.
Go milk cows or collect manure to accumulate the required amount of reputation points to summon a boss. This stupid RPG is what we deserved. Hello Dying Light 2 and goose presentations.
""This is an RPG!"" one of the readers of this review will caw. No, this is not an RPG, - I will answer.

An acceptable example of RPG NOT in a tabletop game is Cyberpunk 2077.

In general (by the way, go to hell all those who suddenly started saying ""in general and as a whole"" because of the son of a prostitute from what was next)... Here... in general, the marketing department and executive directors of Ubisoft are just geniuses who changed the whole industry. They took the concept of Blacklist and turned it into garbage, and even added an RPG tag.

Now again, for the gifted. Ubisoft took a game with a cat-poop scenario and stuffed it with mini-missions up to the top! And this gave them exactly a smooth surface for stamping games on it. Soon, from garage garbage collectors to other companies, everyone picked up this concept, and it became the canon for RPG games.
And you won't finish it! The game has an RPG tag, half the country doesn't even know that it's not the same as an MMO. And the other half is sure that character leveling equals a role-playing game, and screw the fact that there are no roles, and in the case of Far Cry, the protagonist is mute!

With such a ""given,"" it's not surprising that Far Cry 4 became absolutely mediocre and faceless crap. And what carried this franchise on its shoulders, suddenly turned out that besides the clay ""bow"" and one hundred percent botoxed boobs, it couldn't offer anything else.

Scenario - minimal, and it's an old story
Villain - porous
Gameplay - any Ubisoft game.

enemies shoot you from 3 miles away, eat up your syringes, then you are forced to heal for 20 seconds. every fight, i was healing more than i was able to attack. this game feels more like a driving sim with random stops to pick flowers than a far cry game. nothing feels fluid, i dont feel any progression, im not motivated to keep playing when i just keep getting fucked in the ass by every part of the game.

you play as ajay ghale, a kid who came to nepal to set his mother's ashes free and somehow gets stuck in the middle of a battle to end a dictatorship. the funny part is, mr. ajay here is an absolute beast at killing both humans and animals alike and does it better than anyone else while having no actual reason to be as skillful and fearless as he is. you just start good, there is no sense of progression, character development nor motivation to help end the war. i mean, sure, the north (where you'd want to set the ashes free) is blocked by the army and you are ""the son of the great man who started the revolution"", but is this seriously all the motivation the story has to offer? having your main character live in the shadow of their father? 

the game throws 2 dimensional characters in your face multiple times and expects you to give a shit about any of them while forcing you to make nonsensical choices - my favorite being having to pick between 2 characters who 1) want to burn an opium field to stop the distribution of drugs or 2) instead recapture it and use the drugs to fund their war. i chose to burn the opium fields and one of the characters slaps me with a ""why did you burn the fields??? we could have used the opium for medicinal purposes!!!!""

then why not just tell me you wanted to use the opium for medicinal uses? why hide this information? your whole argument was using the opium for drug use, not to help people, and now you're trying to be all self righteous when i chose to burn it all.

the whole game is filled with stupid little choices like these that are supposed to make you question your actions but they only make you question the reason you are playing it.

combat is boring, frustrating and unispired. enemies are spongey, never miss their shots and can hit you behind objects or trees most of the time.

i came into this game with high expectations because of how well everybody talks about it but i just don't see it. had a very frustrating time with it and at this point i'm dragging my feet to just end the story.",1700873549,1700874014,False,2,0,0.499615103006362915,0,True,False,False

The first is that all cutscenes are unskippable. The story is great but sometimes I don't want to watch 3 minute cutscenes and occasionally the game doesn't remember your save and you have to watch like 3 cutscenes again. Another thing is I feel like there aren't enough enemies. I started the game on regular difficulty and there were barely any enemies so I switched the difficulty to hard. There still aren't as many enemies as I would like. For example in Far Cry 5 there are enemies that spawn all over the place and they just drive around in vehicles around the map and it's very hard to run around for 5 minutes and not see an enemy or have one drive past you to shoot at. In Far Cry 4, you basically drive from one mission to the next without any enemies interrupting so the gameplay feels much more linear.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This game helped me realize that.

I'll be covering how much this game means to me as well as how it performs with max graphics and what it has to offer along with it's gameplay, story, and dlc.

Graphics.

I was blown away with the difference of graphics with this game compared to the console version of this game, I had my 4070ti running a smooth frame rate of 160-170fps as the average. I believe that it wouldn't have dropped have dropped any lower than that. The graphics during cutscenes felt as if I was watching a film from my monitor (1440p + 170hz) regardless of cutscenes, the game didn't fail to wow me from the attention to detail as you journey your way through Kyrat. For a game almost 10 years old, it was amazing to experience it all. Please notice that this game shows its age. However. When I mention how great these graphics are, they're more than acceptable for anyone.

I never experienced any issues with my time during the game in terms of graphics.

Graphics: 8.3 
Reason: Performs great with no issues with amazing detail, however shows its age with the surroundings and textures such as trees, ground, buildings and hills, etc.

Gameplay.

The gunplay in this game was quite fun, I'd say that its easily enjoyable for the average individual player. I always enjoy the satisfaction of liberating the several outposts along the map and playing through missions with an addiction of taking down my enemies with a suppressed sniper capable to penetrate the dome of your enemies with a simple bullet. Odd? no. FUN. If you loves guns then you may find this game fun to play with the many guns available to you to claim in YOUR hands. Not a fan of guns, choom? not a problem!

Perform takedowns upon your enemies and murder them as the savage you are that we never question in some ways. The possibilities are endless wether its takedowns from ledges, maybe using grenades to combine within your takedown would be your cup of tea! No? WELL MY FRIEND. This game features a GUN TAKEDOWN. Allow me to explain. Performing a takedown on your foes to where you grab their sidearm and dump a mag with their pistol on their comrades. PURELY satisfying.

The driving is meh, I wont say much since I barely ever drive in this game. I find it boring but to be fair this is a 2014 game. The driving is limited with its vehicles and it bores me.

Oh and the game includes grappling which I find incredibly fun.

Gameplay: 7.3 
Reason: Wasn't much to say and this game was very similar with Far Cry 3 in some of the skills and weapons and the driving is the worst part of this game in my opinion.

Story and DLC.

I probably won't say much here since it's quite late at the time of this review however I must say that the main story is an absolute thrill to play through as you are playing through the perspective of Ajay Ghale, a man who comes to Kyrat to find Lakshmana and spread your mother's ashes. You are thrown in Kyrat as it's under a battle of war which you assist with whilst attempting to reach Lakshmana. I personally found myself getting side tracked with the open world as well as doing quests to unlock skill points and hunting animals to upgrade my gear. All to improve my character and preference of experience, it happens to the best of us lol.

The dlc was short for me, this was mainly because of how many times I've replayed the story several times many years ago, in other words I knew what to expect and how to handle situations along with a simple and easy grind. Do I recommend this DLC? yes. It opens a new area to the player along with a new style of environment and enemies which I won't spoil.

Story and DLC: 7.1
Reason: This may be biased towards how I feel but the story may feel incredibly short when you are primarily focusing on it, yes it's fun but after replaying this game several times on console only to finish it once more on pc, the experience isn't the same rather than others so there is my honest review on FC4.

I can't give this game an overall exact rating on my behalf due to how I'm currently rushing this review, however I'll say that this game is around the rating of 7.0-7.6.

Thanks for reading my honest review and apologies on my rushed response on this review. 

As always. BUY THIS GAME DURING A SALE. It definitely isn't worth paying full price for what it has to offer, I'm sure you could find other games.

MAN1
Think it's in there?
MAN2
All right. Let's get it!
MAN1
Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what
that thing can do to you?
MAN3
Yeah, it'll grind your bones for
it's bread.
Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.
SHREK
Yes, well, actually, that would be
a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're
much worse. They'll make a suit
from your freshly peeled skin.
MEN
No!
SHREK
They'll shave your liver. Squeeze
the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast.
MAN1
Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya!
(waves the torch at
Shrek.)
Shrek calmly licks his fingers and
extinguishes the torch. The men
shrink back away from him. Shrek
roars very loudly and long and his
breath extinguishes all the
remaining torches until the men are
in the dark.
SHREK
This is the part where you run
away.
(The men scramble to get
away. He laughs.)
And stay out! (looks down and picks
up a piece of paper. Reads.) ""Wanted. Fairy tale creatures.""(He
sighs and throws the paper over his
shoulder.)
THE NEXT DAY
There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the
guard sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy
tale creatures to him. There are cages all around. Some of
the people in line are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell
in a cage, Gipetto who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer
who is carrying the three little pigs.
GUARD
All right. This one's full. Take it
away! Move it along. Come on! Get
up!
HEAD GUARD
Next!
GUARD
(taking the witch's broom) Give me
that! Your flying days are over.
(breaks the broom in half)
HEAD GUARD
That's 20 pieces of silver for the
witch. Next!
GUARD
Get up! Come on!
HEAD GUARD
Twenty pieces.
2.
LITTLE BEAR
(crying) This cage is too small.
DONKEY
Please, don't turn me in. I'll
never be stubborn again. I can
change. Please! Give me another
chance!
OLD WOMAN
Oh, shut up. (jerks his rope)
DONKEY
Oh!
HEAD GUARD
Next! What have you got?
GIPETTO
This little wooden puppet.
PINOCCHIO
I'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his nose grows)
HEAD GUARD
Five shillings for the possessed
toy. Take it away.
PINOCCHIO
Father, please! Don't let them do
this! Help me!
Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps
up to the table.
HEAD GUARD
Next! What have you got?
OLD WOMAN
Well, I've got a talking donkey.
HEAD GUARD
Right. Well, that's good for ten
shillings, if you can prove it.
OLD WOMAN
Oh, go ahead, little fella.
Donkey just looks up at her.
HEAD GUARD
Well?
3.
OLD WOMAN
Oh, oh, he's just...he's just a
little nervous. He's really quite a
chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded
dolt...
HEAD GUARD
That's it. I've heard enough. Guards!
OLD WOMAN
No, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest
damn thing you ever saw.
HEAD GUARD
Get her out of my sight.
OLD WOMAN
No, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk!
The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter
Pan's hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets
sprinkled with fairy dust and he's able to fly.
DONKEY
Hey! I can fly!
PETER PAN
He can fly!
LITTLE PIGS
He can fly!
HEAD GUARD
He can talk!
DONKEY
Ha, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm
a flying, talking donkey. You might
have seen a housefly, maybe even a
superfly but I bet you ain't never
seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the
pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh- oh. (he begins to sink to the
ground.)
He hits the ground with a thud.
HEAD GUARD
Seize him! (Donkey takes of
running.) After him!
4.
GUARDS
He's getting away! Get him! This
way! Turn!
Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally. Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared for a moment then he spots the guards
coming up the path. He quickly hides behind Shrek.
HEAD GUARD
You there. Ogre!
SHREK
Aye?
HEAD GUARD
By the order of Lord Farquaad I am
authorized to place you both under
arrest and transport you to a
designated resettlement facility.
SHREK
Oh, really? You and what army?
He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as
well and we see that the other men have run off. The guard
tucks tail and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about
his business and begins walking back to his cottage.
DONKEY
Can I say something to you? Listen,
you was really, really, really
somethin' back here. Incredible!
SHREK
Are you talkin' to...(he turns
around and Donkey is gone) me? (he
turns back around and Donkey is
right in front of him.) Whoa!
DONKEY
Yes. I was talkin' to you. Can I
tell you that you that you was
great back here? Those guards! They
thought they was all of that. Then
you showed up, and bam! They was
trippin' over themselves like babes
in the woods. That really made me
feel good to see that.
SHREK
Oh, that's great. Really.
5.
DONKEY
Man, it's good to be free.
SHREK
Now, why don't you go celebrate
your freedom with your own friends?
Hmm?
DONKEY
But, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by
myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a
great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the
spit out of anybody that crosses
us.
Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring
very loudly.
DONKEY (CONT’D)
Oh, wow! That was really scary. If
you don't mind me sayin', if that
don't work, your breath certainly
will get the job done, 'cause you
definitely need some Tic Tacs or
something, 'cause you breath
stinks! You almost burned the hair
outta my nose, just like the
time...(Shrek covers his mouth but
Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek
removes his hand.) ...then I ate
some rotten berries. I had strong
gases leaking out of my butt that
day.
SHREK
Why are you following me?
DONKEY
I'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause
I'm all alone, There's no one here
beside me, My problems have all
gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith...
SHREK
Stop singing! It's no wonder you
don't have any friends.
DONKEY
Wow. Only a true friend would be
that cruelly honest.
6.
SHREK
Listen, little donkey. Take a look
at me. What am I?
DONKEY
(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall?
SHREK
No! I'm an ogre! You know. ""Grab
your torch and pitchforks."" Doesn't
that bother you?
DONKEY
Nope.
SHREK
Really?
DONKEY
Really, really.
SHREK
Oh.
DONKEY
Man, I like you. What's you name?
SHREK
Uh, Shrek.
DONKEY
Shrek? Well, you know what I like
about
you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobodythinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You
all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's
cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place
like that?
SHREK
That would be my home.
DONKEY
Oh! And it is lovely! Just
beautiful. You know you are quite a
decorator. It's amazing what you've
done with such a modest budget. I
like that boulder. That is a nice
boulder. I guess you don't
entertain much, do you?
7.
SHREK
I like my privacy.
DONKEY
You know, I do too. That's another
thing we have in common. Like I
hate it when you got somebody in
your face. You've trying to give
them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with
you?
SHREK
Uh, what?
DONKEY
Can I stay with you, please?
SHREK
(sarcastically) Of course!
DONKEY
Really?
SHREK
No.
DONKEY
Please! I don't wanna go back
there! You don't know what it's
like to be considered a freak.

I get it when you have the same franchise have the same stuff (such as all far cry games), but holy, all the games are the same, what the actual f###? The difference between this crap and skyrim re-release is that at least Bethesda is honest and IS SELLING THE SAME GAME WITH THE SAME NAME. Ubisoft does the same, but with different names

Combat is the same - detection system is the same.
Sneak is the same, so is their related skills - chain sneak, etc
Talking about sneak, there are f##### guard camps? And they light FIRES DURING THE DAY TO CALL OTHERS ATTENTION LIKE EVERY OTHER GAME? Well.. who'd have guessed.
The map FEELS the same, but with different skin and guess what? You probably have the stupid towers to explore this crap.

Furthermore, the game is really worth the money because even after you complete the campaign and practically ""beat the game"" you can still go in and do little side missions.

One of Far Cry 4's standout features is its captivating storyline. The game immerses you in a politically charged and morally complex tale, offering choices that influence the narrative's direction. The characters are well-written, and the conflict between the rebel Golden Path and the oppressive King Pagan Min adds depth to the game world.

Gameplay:
Here's where Far Cry 4 stumbles a bit. While the game retains the open-world exploration and combat that the series is known for, it occasionally falls into monotony. Some of the missions and activities can feel repetitive and lack the spark that the story provides. The abundance of collectibles and side missions, while offering depth, can sometimes lead to a sense of sameness.

Graphics and Sound:
Far Cry 4 excels in the visual department. The game's portrayal of the Himalayan landscape is breathtaking, and the attention to detail is commendable. The sound design complements the visuals, further immersing players in the game's world.

Conclusion:
Far Cry 4 is a mixed bag. The compelling storyline and intriguing characters make it worth experiencing, especially if you enjoy narrative-driven games. However, the gameplay, while not terrible, can become boring due to repetition and a lack of innovation in certain aspects. Despite this, it's a journey worth taking for the gripping narrative and the beautiful world of Kyrat.

Let me explain. even though you clearly have steam, you need to STILL need to make an Ubisoft Connect account/ profile to play. that is one more password to remember (which I never do), one more thing to keep updated, and it doesn't automatically update like discord or Steam. no, you need to open it and give it the permission to update before you launch the game. Your Ubisoft Connect needs to open and running FIRST before it will launch the game you PAID FOR on another gaming service. And this for i am assuming EVERY Ubisoft game. I have to with Far Cry 5, i have yet to play New Dawn, Far Cry 3 isn't installed and Far Cry 6 isn't even on Steam. and you know what I have yet to find it on Ubisoft Connect. 
My advice get a console and play this game (Far Cry 4) on there, and BUY A USED COPY, one of the ""premium"" editions with all the DLC and such. 
So, TLDR Ubisoft's own PC gaming platform ruins the fun of this great game that has been purchased on another gaming platform by making you run and use both, AND UBISOFT'S CONNECT SUCKS.",1697749987,1697749987,False,134,11,0.801291108131408691,10,True,False,False

People usually hold far cry villains on pedestals, hell, the games are marketed around the villains, but from 1-4, Pagan Min is the first one where i felt like he delivered on the hype. The golden sun and their bickering is rather boring and has no likeable characters. The game is carried hard by Min.

When the two faction leaders of the golden sun line up their own kind and kill them with a machete for having differing beliefs.... u realise Pagen torturing what he considers actual terrorists (they are by definition) wasn't so bad.

One wants drugs to run rampant to boost the economy, which will have the side effect of killing many innocents and making the country worse, and other countries through the black market. The other wants tradition, which values human lives but accepts child marriage and the ruthless cut to any who oppose them. While i chose the traditional way because the leader wasn't an ass to you, i would of sided with Pagen at many points throughout the game if given the choice. This game can easily of been better by allowing that third branch.

The MC Ajay shows up and instantly becomes a killer and terrorist for no reason. People praise Jason turning slowly as being well done but i think both cases so far have been absolute ass and unbelievable. I feel like this trend will continue.

Summary: Pagan got this game 1 additional full star over far cry 3 (Backlogged)

I enjoyed it a lot, especially when you get started in the first part of the map near Banapur. The gameplay barring a few bugs is very smooth, and I love the story, mostly because all the Kyrati NPC's dialogues are in my language (Hindi) which is amazing as I had never played any game with Hindi dialogue before and a protagonist named Ajay and there's a lot of funny interactions. One of the things that drew me into this game is how immersive it can get, for example when you do a mission you gain Karma and based on that the NPC's will start becoming friendlier with you and you get access to new dialogue etc. The first few missions made me feel like a true part of Golden Path, helping their fight against Pagan. ""Kyrat is free !"" lives rent free in my head lol. The biggest issue I faced though is how boring & repetitive the game gets after the finishing the first section of the map, every other map section is basically the same with the same types of side missions which end up feeling like a chore, the core missions are great but I ended up finishing the main story line before I even explored the last section of the map, and once that was done I am only going through the side remaining side quests cause I don't like to leave a game unfinished. Also I feel some of the ongoing parallel storylines don't get resolved properly, for example I was expecting a final confrontation with The Goat, especially cause he was leaving messages behind for Ajay, same thing with Mr. Chiffon  just disappearing after spending all this time getting those animal hides. Overall it's a good game that I would recommend people get, if nothing else then just for the Pagan Min cutscenes alone, the voice actor killed it. But wait until it's on sale.",1696826978,1696826978,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A lack of Gyrocopters (it would have been good to have implemented a 'call-one' token system similar to GR:Wildlands) and only one mission by Lester to explore around the mountains that surround the campaign map, make it feel less like a game set around a fictional Nepal country and more like a generic sandbox game with wasted scenery potential that could have been put to better use.

- combat wise it's more of Far Cry 3, just better
- A large arsenal of weapons to choose from
- Fun and challenging outposts with the ability to replay them if you want
- Traversing the map is fun an offers so much choice
- There's a ton of stuff to do if you care to do it all
- Having a grenade launcher as a sidearm

Cons:
- The story. it's just not that interesting, and [spoiler] everyone just turns out to be awful except for Pagan.[/spoiler]
- The missions with the two dope heads (can't even remember their names) are probably meant to be trippy and interesting, but they just come off as running simulators.
- Basically, all of the main missions aren't really all that fun.
- The platforming can be inconsistent at times. Especially in the bell towers or when dropping from what seems like a very short distance.

IMO this game is at it's best when you try to play it stealthily. I also personally found it more fun to go treasure hunting or blowing up enemy vehicles with my grenade launcher as I pass them on the road than do any of the main missions. Kirat is a beautiful world to run around in and is one of the few exceptions to the many emptier open worlds. It's just a shame that the story doesn't follow the same golden path. Not worth replaying to find out what you missed out on. Make your decisions and watch YouTube to see what could have been.",1695540458,1695540458,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The open world is massive and the story is incredible with the main villain Pagan's ways being actually understandable. Its easily completeable under 40 hours~, but I'd rather fly or drive around the map because it is truly beautiful.

Some things that I like are:
-The missions (especially hostage rescues)
-The variety of animals, ways of transport
-The guns

Some thing that I DON'T like are:
-CO-OP is unplayable (literally)
-Arena mode is boring as hell ( you need it for 100%)
-Random Outpost attacks , and the weirdest locations for hostage rescues and fights for Karma points

But all-in all for the story, the gameplay, and the scenery it is 10/9 for me and my favourite Far Cry from the franchise so far! (DLC'S are cool too)

Це найяскравіший представник відомої серії від Ubisoft, і я впевнений, що кожен геймер, хто вирішить віддати їй шанс, отримає багато незабутніх вражень.

Графіка у Far Cry 4 просто зачаровує. Відкритий світ гри розкривається перед гравцем в усій своїй красі - різноманітність ландшафтів, деталізація природи, архітектура екзотичних міст і селищ - все це створює неймовірну атмосферу, яка просто вбиває своєю красою. Зачаровують і великі різноманітність пейзажів, починаючи від живописних гірських вершин і закінчуючи зеленими джунглями. Відчуття відкритості і свободи в цьому світі дійсно неперевершені.

Геймплей також на висоті. Ви отримуєте доступ до великого арсеналу зброї, і можливість вибору між різними стилями гри - чи то скритний підхід, чи ж вибухові ворожі армії. Динамічні сутички з дикими тваринами та ворогами завжди залишають вас в напруженні. Гра також пропонує багато різноманітних завдань і завдань на вибір, що додає багато годин геймплею і різноманітості.

Сюжет гри теж дуже цікавий. Ви опиняєтеся в середовищі політичних інтриг і боротьби за владу у вигаданій країні Кират. Головний злодій - Пейган Мін, зображений з дивовижною глибиною і амбівалентністю. Ваші вибори впливають на розвиток подій, і ви можете обирати, яким буде кінець гри.

Також варто відзначити дуже різноманітний і веселий мультиплеєр, де ви можете зіграти з друзями в різноманітні режими, включаючи кооперативний режим, який дозволяє пройти кампанію разом з товаришами.

У підсумку, Far Cry 4 - це гра, яка неодмінно зачарує вас своєю красою, різноманіттям геймплею і цікавим сюжетом. Це справжній шедевр серії і гідна уваги для будь-якого шанувальника відеоігор.

The game boasts stunning visuals, with lush landscapes and detailed character designs that immerse players in its richly crafted world. The storyline, centered around a civil war and a ruthless dictator, adds depth to the gameplay, though it occasionally lacks the emotional resonance of its predecessor.

Gameplay is a highlight, featuring a vast open world ripe for exploration, a variety of vehicles, and a wide array of weapons to choose from. The game introduces the verticality of its mountainous setting, which enhances both combat and traversal. Additionally, the inclusion of wildlife adds unpredictability to encounters, as dangerous animals can suddenly disrupt your plans.

One drawback is a repetitive mission structure, which can make the game feel a bit formulaic over time. However, the wealth of side activities, including hunting and outpost liberations, offers plenty of opportunities for diversions.

Aside from pretty graphics and landscapes, If you pay attention to some NPCs you'll often find that they move and interact with the world like a normal person. one of my favourite things is finding an NPC with a broken down car, and being able to fix for them, and seeing them actually get in the car and drive away, after thanking you, of course. 

This also applies to animals as Sometimes in the wilderness you'll find two animals fighting it out, or you'll see an eagle grab a small pig and carry it away. 

While this game doesn't have the detail and depth of Red Dead Redemption 2, for example, the world feels more alive than people give it credit for, and with a decent amount of lore and a solid storyline, I highly recommended experiencing Kyrat at least once in your life.

As for gameplay...it's genuinely fun, and you'll probably spend hours trying to stealth outposts or fortresses in the most bad ass way you can. Gunplay is solid, the enemy AI is decent, and there is enough side content to keep you invested for a while, although that aspect can get repetitive. 

the last point I need to make is that there are bugs, and while some are hilarious, there are others that can get frustrating, but this is entirely subjective. I've played through this game a total of 4 different times across multiple platforms, and 3 out of 4 play-throughs were relatively polished experiences.

Overall, I highly recommended this game, especially on sale!",1694601695,1694601695,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

First and foremost, the game's open-world setting is nothing short of stunning. The fictional country of Kyrat is a visually captivating blend of lush forests, snowy peaks, and vibrant villages. The attention to detail in creating this world is commendable, and it offers a truly immersive experience.

The gameplay is where Far Cry 4 truly shines. The freedom it provides is exhilarating, allowing players to approach missions and objectives in a multitude of ways. Whether you prefer stealthy takedowns, explosive mayhem, or utilizing the game's extensive arsenal of weapons, Far Cry 4 caters to your playstyle. The introduction of the gyrocopter and grappling hook adds new dimensions to exploration and combat, making the game even more enjoyable.

The game's antagonist, Pagan Min, is a charismatic and memorable character, brilliantly portrayed by Troy Baker. His unpredictable nature keeps players engaged in the story, and the moral dilemmas presented throughout the game add depth to the narrative.

Far Cry 4 also excels in its variety of side activities, from liberating outposts to hunting exotic animals, all of which contribute to character progression. The co-op mode is a blast, allowing you to wreak havoc with a friend in the open world, adding a social dimension to the chaos.

However, the game does have some minor drawbacks. The story, while engaging, may feel less memorable than its predecessor, Far Cry 3. Additionally, some players may find the pacing a bit uneven at times.

Overall, Far Cry 4 is a thrilling and visually stunning open-world experience that successfully builds upon the strengths of its predecessor. It offers a vast playground for exploration and destruction, with a compelling antagonist and a diverse range of activities to keep you entertained for hours on end. If you're a fan of the open-world FPS genre, Far Cry 4 is well worth a playthrough.",1693770388,1693770388,True,1,1,0.516129076480865479,0,True,False,False

You explore a new huge world, have a new weapons for killing, gyrocopter available for flying over a big spaces, and a new wildlife. To make things even better you can play it in co-op. And when you finish campaign, there is workshop for new maps made from fans.

They have kept the satisfying options to how you want to approach the missions. 

The story overall is better than Far Cry 3. I liked Pagan as the villain but he's no Vaas. The voice acting is much better in this one.

Far Cry 4 is an absolute gem in the open-world shooter genre. Ubisoft has once again delivered a breathtaking world to explore, this time in the Himalayas, and it's nothing short of spectacular.

The game's protagonist, Ajay Ghale, finds himself in the midst of a civil war in the fictional country of Kyrat, and the storytelling is engaging from start to finish. The character of Pagan Min is a standout, a charismatic yet unpredictable villain that keeps you on your toes.

The gameplay is where Far Cry 4 truly shines. The vast open world is teeming with wildlife and activities, and it's a blast to take on outposts stealthily or go in guns blazing. The addition of the gyrocopter and the grappling hook adds a new dimension to exploration and combat.

Graphically, the game is stunning. The attention to detail in the environment is top-notch, from the snow-covered mountains to the lush forests. And the use of color in the game, especially the vibrant reds and blues, creates a visual feast.

Co-op mode is a blast, allowing you to team up with a friend to tackle missions and wreak havoc together. It adds a new layer of fun to an already fantastic game.

My only minor gripe is with the occasional technical glitch, but they were far from game-breaking and didn't detract from my overall enjoyment.

One part is being the new game in the franchise.
The other, its almost similar to previous entry, only with different world and story.

First, i'm gonna talk about the negative thing from this game and then work our way up :
- ONLY ONE SAVE SLOT, Like, Why? Far Cry 3 has 4 save slot if i remember correctly, and this game has different ending too. I mean, you can backup the save before playing
new game for different ending. But it obviously so much better if there is more than one slot.
- Unskippable cutscenes. Again. Why? It should be common option to have choice to skip cutscene.
- It plays too similar to far cry 3, for example like outpost, tower, gunplay, skinning animal sounds similar, the stealth also similar. I don't really mind with this,
as long as it still fun, but for some people, it can be pretty stale.
- Comparing to far cry 3, the story is pretty weak here in my opinion, the motive just doesn't make sense. And there is no character development. You're just getting
stronger and thats it. 
- The mission can be a bit dragging at some part, by just pouring more and more enemies.
- Bugs still exist and some can be annoying. One of them is a location can't be explored and has to be exploited to get there. And i encounter some unnecessary death.
- Crash also still happen, but only when i do shangri-la mission, which really annoying, because if you crash, you gonna start from the beginning of the mission, instead of checkpoint.
- The enemies can also be annoying, like some enemies can shot gun very rapidly and drain your health so quickly even on normal.
- I don't know about the multiplayer or co-op, but i heard it doesn't work anymore. So thats bad.

The Positive : 
- The main villain is always key role in far cry games. And this one isn't disappointing. The charm and vibe is so much calmer than far cry 3, but still intimidating at some point. 
Probably one of my favorite character in video games. It voice by troy baker, which already one of the most iconic video game voice actor, and he did so well in this one.
- The World is beautiful and stunning. I like the settings in this game. I just wish we can fully explore the snowy mountain part more and it become permanent place instead of just there for certain mission.
- More sandbox than previous game, even tho i said its almost similar to far cry 3, gunplay still fun.
- There is duality during the campaign mission, where there are 2 people that you can side to and which person's mission you want to do. 
This is interesting idea, and i quiet like it. Altho, i haven't try the other option.
- At least there are more variety in terms of look for the outpost and tower. That means, it give more different way in capturing outpost. And the fortress addition is great.
- Soundtrack is great, not as iconic as far cry 3, but great.
- One of little detail that i like is the car radio announcer, which they will say different stuff throughout the story till the end.
- Lot of interesting easter eggs and hidden location. 
- Riding elephant is definitely good addition.


I swear there are many things i want to say about this game, and i definitely missed some things i don't mention above. But in the end, i still appreciate this game much.
Its definitely not as average as people think. And i definitely still like this game.

Those two factors are fairly major in setting it apart, though. This time, the thing loses all pretences of being a satirical look at the complicity in violence of its player-base, instead focusing on delivering a relatively nuanced story with more straightforward narrative theming. It also removes the 'white saviour' aspect of prior titles by having its protagonist return to the place of his birth at the start of the game. Of course, he gets caught up in a civil war, participating in bringing down a local regime simply to find some personal closure. The thing does a great job of tying these two aspects together, especially as it reaches its conclusion. It also features branching mission paths that don't change the overarching story so much as emphasise the 'give and take' aspects of each route. For example, whether you blow up a drugs farm or reclaim it - a choice between morals and money - will have ramifications for the next generation far after your time here is over. Obviously, the game and its world don't continue when you turn off your console, but they almost feel like they do; the choices you make may not have all that much impact - they don't affect the gameplay, for instance - but they still feel important. The game itself consists of clearing out bases, climbing up towers, finding hidden caches, hunting to make equipment, delivering arms to resistance fighters and working your way through the story, ultimately aiming towards a clear goal outlined at the very start of the campaign. It's highly enjoyable and doesn't get dull. The ending is actually satisfying, too. (I got the worst one) Overall, this is probably the best game in the series. 8/10",1692289954,1692290360,True,20,2,0.64317852258682251,0,True,False,False

I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories.

Unlike far cry 3 which had a separate campaign for coop this game lets you coop in the main map, but you have to drop for story missions which is awful. Also had some issues with multiplayer with connection drops and desync. No matter which of us joined the others game we'd experience times where enemies would be there but the joining player couldn't see them. Also the game only saved progression for the host so we ended up having to do everything twice. 

The story itself sucks, you go to scatter your mothers ashes and somehow get drawn into a civil war. Obviously games need a premise to get you to fight but this makes the alternate ending where you just stay at the table at the start feel like the true ending because you scatter the ashes without so much bs between. The golden paths two leaders are both awful, and rather than feeling like it's hard to pick who's right you end up not wanting to pick anyone because their both garbage.

Gameplay is the same as other far cry games, the guns are good, taking over outposts is fun, climbing radio towers to show map objectives, and some side mission things that feel like varying degrees of busy work (I found assassinations and hostage rescue fun, but hunting and racing boring). The drug missions were stupid and the strange spirit vision quests that basically were prototype far cry primal didn't add much to the game for me, I completely forgot what their story was and gave up doing when i got 3/5.",1691300020,1691300020,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I had no care for anyone in this game and had no drive as a player to immerse myself in it. The bad guy was just... pointless! There was no fear of him or his henchmen. The Golden Path was just as pointless. It was like being tossed inbetween two Jersey girls fighting over an ugly dress that hasn't been washed in a week. Why would i care to side with either one?

Power choices are a joke when it doesn't change anything related to the story. There was no fight with one or the other. You see nothing at endgame to suggest you made a bad or good decision. So why even have it?

The lone fighter trope has gotten incredibly old and i have no doubt the rest of the games in this series will be any different. FC 1 & 2 made sense but 3 & 4 don't.  You have an army of people are you disposal but you still race on to do everything yourself. Yes you have a ""Token"" you can use to summon one person but not for story missions or any mission infact. Its boring and a waste of potential for a game as big as this. 

It surpasses the past FC games in terms of size and visuals. I'm one for open world games that i get to explore but with the constant rebel fighting that continues to happen regardless of how many Outposts and Fortress's you take down, it makes you feel like you haven't done shit. The hunting aspect of it would have been good if it wasn't for the crappy gunplay for the majority of the weapons. You have to wait till the end to get the guns you care about and there's no reason to sub in any other. And at that point, you're already done with the story so you don't get to use them as much. The constant eagle attacks made finding loot crates and other collectibles an annoyance. The AI was just as bad. Driving directly in front of your vehicle when you pass by, driving right over you when you're fighting bad guys, running right in your line of fire and heli blades when trying to land. It was a mess that made me verbally moan in frustration since the game just kills you if you hurt a good guy... 

I can't personally recommend this FC game but that won't stop anyone from playing.",1691256110,1691256110,False,0,0,0.47191011905670166,0,True,False,False

The game aside from the story is a lot of fun and has a lot of creative approaches. After all, it's an open world game that gives you whole side missions and freedom over the possibilities.

Of course there are other downsides besides the story, such as shooting. The weapon physics are weirdly created in FarCry4. the AK47 does not fire at its target and it is not an isolated case. *But you notice it quickly with her, because it's one of the first weapons in the game* Generally, all auto weapons are so poor in accuracy, even though you only fire single bullets. Semi auto guns, pistols and shotguns have been made better since then.

Another thing that bothered me was the enemy spawn probability. If you destroy a convoy, the next one comes after about 15 seconds. this restricts the calmness of the game a bit, but fortunately there is almost travel for that.

I would say that you should give the game a chance and that you should focus more on the positive sides, such as the graphics or the quiet approach to missions and outposts.

As an avid gamer, I recently had the pleasure of immersing myself in the captivating world of Far Cry 4, and I must say, it was an extraordinary experience from start to finish! Ubisoft has truly outdone themselves with this installment of the beloved Far Cry series, delivering a game that combines heart-pounding action, stunning visuals, and a richly diverse open-world environment.

One of the most impressive aspects of Far Cry 4 is the breathtaking landscape of Kyrat. The lush, Himalayan-inspired setting provides players with a vast and visually mesmerizing playground. From towering snow-capped mountains to dense forests and picturesque valleys, every corner of Kyrat is a sight to behold. The attention to detail is remarkable, making exploration a sheer delight as I found myself constantly getting lost in the beauty of the world around me.

The narrative of Far Cry 4 is equally compelling, as it takes players on a roller-coaster journey through political intrigue, rebellion, and personal discovery. The complex characters, particularly the enigmatic Pagan Min, add depth to the storyline, leaving players emotionally invested in the outcome. The freedom to approach missions in multiple ways also enhances the game's replayability, ensuring that each playthrough feels unique and personal.

Gameplay mechanics are fluid and polished, making combat encounters feel natural and satisfying. Whether it's engaging in intense shootouts or employing stealth to take down enemies one by one, Far Cry 4 offers a wide range of options to suit any playstyle. The introduction of a vast array of weapons and tools adds spice to the action, allowing players to experiment and adapt their tactics to different situations.

Moreover, the game features a wealth of side activities and collectibles, which kept me constantly entertained between main missions. Hunting exotic wildlife, liberating outposts, and participating in thrilling races and challenges added depth to my adventure, offering countless hours of enjoyable content beyond the main storyline.

Let's not forget the delightful co-op mode, which allowed me to team up with a friend and embark on unforgettable adventures together. The seamless integration of co-op into the single-player experience made for an even more engaging and memorable time.

Lastly, I must commend the game's impeccable sound design and a phenomenal musical score that heightened the overall immersion. The subtle sounds of wildlife, the echoes of gunfire across the mountains, and the stirring soundtrack all contributed to making Far Cry 4 an audiovisual masterpiece.

In conclusion, Far Cry 4 is an exceptional gaming experience that excels in every aspect. With its captivating world, engaging storyline, diverse gameplay, and impressive multiplayer options, it's a must-play for any gamer seeking an enthralling and immersive adventure. Ubisoft has truly raised the bar with this installment, and I can't wait to see where they take us next in the Far Cry universe!",1690549651,1690549651,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This company just grabs it's cash and keeps rolling. There are literally only 2 more AC games I want to buy, AC:2 and Brotherhood then I refuse to deal with any new UBISOFT shit. Far Cry 4 is fun although it get boring when you become O.P with a WW2 machine gun, but my point is UBISOFT can get bent if they're not going to actually care about customers.",1690480429,1690480429,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

KILL KILL KILL I HOPE GHALE DIES KILL HIM KILL HIS STEP-FATHER TOO KILL HIM!!! I HATE THEM I HOPE THEY BOTH GET STUCK IN A CAVE AND DIE. I HOPE THEY BOTH GET TO RELIVE THEIR WORST MOMENTS IN THEIR LIVES. GOD I HATE THEM

Anyway, this is a fantastic game with a great story, a breautiful atmosphere and generally beautiful graphics. I could not recommend it enough, even though I may be biased since this is my special interest ^^' I Think the thing that stands as one of the strongest points in the story of this game is Pagan Min and Ajay Ghale's relationship, especially since we get to see the relationship through the eyes of Mr. Ghale ourselves. I love how Ajay never got the hints Pagan gave him that they were semi-related, for example, Pagan refering to himself as Uncle infront of Ajay, talking in a fatherly manner towards him every time they talk, sometimes going to the point of trying to save his life too, etc.

 Even in the ""Escape From Durgesh Prison"" DLC, Pagan refers to himself as ""Daddy"" infront of Ajay two times, (and perhaps even more times that I have not counted,) yet Ajay still doesn't pick his hidden message up. He is so stupid and that's why I love him so much. (Platonically!!)

Ajay and Pagan's dynamic is just so interesting in general. We have the step-son, who literally is trying to kill his step-father, and the step-father who loves his step-son and thinks that all of what is happening is a game and not really that serious. That is at least what I interpret from their interactions... But that is why I love their dynamic. To summerize it, I usually just say ""Son hates father, father loves son."" And I think that this type of dynamic is kind of hard to find, which is why I might like it so much. They are just!! So special to me!!! And they are a big part of the reason I still play this game. The other parts are just as awesome though.

As I've said before, this game is STUNNING. The graphics are actually fantastic for a game made in 2014, and the entirety of the map is a pleasure to walk and ride through, however I don't think this would have been possible if the developers had not gone to Nepal to get research on how the landscape, buildings and civilzations looked like. You can tell they put a lot of effort into trying to get everything right to it's respective original source, and I sincerely hope they got everything right. All I know is that Kyrat and it's people are beautiful and amazing.

The contrast between the fantastic landscapes and horrific gunshots everywhere is definitely noticable though, and I think it's certainly interesting how they chose to portray war here. If you didn't already know, the war between Pagan and the Golden Path is inspired by the Nepalese Civil War. It was a tragic time period in the history of Nepal I can imagine. <:( I will not go over it here though since I do not have much knowledge about the topic. 

Even though this is a Far Cry game we're talking about, it's still nice that they tried to include some serious moments. War is serious, and I do not think it would look good for them if they made war look like it was all fun and games.

But the characters.... Ooohh the characters... I love how they are all different and distinct from each other, like in terms of appearance, personality, etc. The backstories for each important character are so well written I think, though a bit obscure sometimes. The character designs are top notch though, and you can see that many of the important character outfits are impacted by their wearers respective culture(s). Even the NPCs have culturally impacted clothes and accessories on, which is really cool! There are ethnic features on every character as well, which is really nice to see. :)  But talking about the story again, I do think Ubisoft could have at least given people like Noore, Paul and Yuma more screen time, as well as some of the side characters like Rabi Ray Ranna, Mumu Chiffon and Longinus some more attention as well. They are all lovely and loveable characters, but the fact that they have so little screen time makes them more forgettable, sadly :(( And don't even get me started on Pagan. God I wish he had more screen time, both cutscene wise and radio call wise. I loved seeing and hearing Pagan and Ajay interact, specifically because Pagan was probably the most well-written character in the game. Troy Baker absolutely killed it with his performance, and if you squint, you can hear that he makes his voice softer when Pagan is talking to Ajay. That just shows even more how talented he is. GRRR I HATE THEM I HATE THEM SO MUCH DIE!!! DIE!!!! WORST FATHER SON DUO EVER!!! THUMBS DOWN

No but everyone in the game did such a fantastic job with their voice acting, and motion capture as well! And even though many players like to hate on Ajay, mostly because of his vocal absence in the main game, he does actually speak from time to time. If you go through the side quests, you can see that he really has quite the personality! ^^ He apparently likes taking risks, and seems more humble than Jason from Far Cry 3. You can see that a lot through out the story, but a great example is also when he laughed for the first and only time in the entire game. He accidentally laughed at a man's story about his wife getting eaten alive by Honey badgers, thinking it was a joke. In the end though, he realized it was a real story, and quickly apologised. You could physically hear him feeling bad, and that is also why I think James A. Wood, Ajay Ghale's voice actor, should get more credit for his work here. He is a fantastic voice actor, just like everyone else in the game, and he did an amazing job giving Ajay more personality when he finally did speak in the game. Thank you James A. Wood, your performance won't be forgotten.

But anyways, enough rambling from me, thank you for reading! Would definitely recommend buying this game, it's especially fun with friends. Still hate Ajay though I hope he and Pagan dies. Right now. Ubisoft please",1593635004,1690467973,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Having a non-white protagonist in a Nepal inspired country, setting up multiple endings where none of them can be considered clear-cut good, tackling so many social issues in a less cartoony way compared to Far Cry 3... I think playing this game is a great experience that still holds up today.

Tried replaying FC 3 lately and really gave up due to how old the gameplay feels, but this one feels smooth even after several iterations of the game. 

It's curious that in Far Cry 6 they also went back to the idea of leading a guerilla insurrection against a dictator, but instead of having you choose the paths taken by the guerilla and shaping the future of the country in the process, it just gives you a (good but) linear story where you can really only have one experience. 

Wish they would go back to trying what they did with FC 4. Give you options to shape the country according to whose vision you associate with the most. Address the gray areas of a revolution.

1. Great open world and graphics
2. Elephants
3. Conquering the outposts and other similar quests are very fun
4. The gunplay feels good, especially with the better weapons
5. Humorous dialogues and monologues  

What I didn't like
1. On the missions where you choose which leader you are going to support, the voice acting is off
2. Checkpoints could be better in some quests
3. I found the driving quests to be boring, irritating and out of place and the driving in general felt a little off
4. The ""radio show"" monologues, although funny, were very repetitive
5. Some irritating and illogical criteria to complete some quests, as well as illogical behavior from the npcs. Why should I use a particular type of gun to kill the commanders? And why are the guard's first priority to shoot at the hostages instead of me, when I'm obviously shooting at them.
6. ""Shangri-la"" and any other drug/dreamy related quest was by far the biggest con of the game. Fortunately, only a couple of those are forced. Still, I didn't spend my time looting to buy the best weapons, just to fight the boss in a drug-induced dream sequence with a magical arrow. If I wanted that, I would play assassin's creed origins again.  
7. The endings are badly written and the characters are not well developed. The whole ""choice and consequence"" theme was not well done - it felt like your actions didn't and couldn't have any significant impact. 
8. The music was unimpressive
9. Unskippable scripted scenes


Summary
I have played far cry 1 and 2 and watched extended reviews and gameplay of far cry 5 and 6.
I did not like any of them, so Far cry 4 is the first game of this series I like. 
Personally I prefer tactical/team shooters because they are more realistic, thus more immersive for me. In this case, even though it's not a tactical shooter and I did not like the how the ""choices and consequences"" theme was handled, the open world, the gunplay, the humor and most of the quests were more than enough to keep me entertained. 
It was a very fun game to play. If you like the ""one-man-army FPS"" genre, then you will most probably like this one.",1689434978,1689957535,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Not because it's a bad game, it's an amazing game, only due to game length. There are many, many side quests , however it's still not a loooong game. If you want more about the game, keep reading, If you were only looking for a short answer, I guess this is goodbye :(

So my boyfriend and I have gone back and forth on whether I should buy this game for an actual year. He said yes, I said nah. I was a moron just fyi... So I got it on the Summer sale and my Lord. I loved it!! For reference, Fallout was my ride or die, but now I'm feeling like a divorce might be in order. It's small things like character stories, the mini map that helps you work out a route to get to where you have to be, Fashion Week, yes Fashion Week! Gun skins, all sorts of vehicles, everything wrapped up into Far Cry 4. I love this game and I wish that more devs would look at small convenient ways to make my life easier and more creative, like Fashion Week!! I'm serious ya'll, it's a ride and you will be getting something out of it!

Now for the critique, so I would have liked a story with a bit more oomph if that makes sense. Beware, there might be spoilers ahead. Sabal and Amita are lovely but in the end I hated both of them and fell head over heels for King Min. Now others might disagree with me here and that's actually a good thing since we're all gonna have our own experiences with this game! But to me personally, I would have liked an option where I did something that actually felt like the right decision to make. So without giving too much away, both Amita and Sabal are fighting for a Fucked up overall vision. Keep in mind that I did extra reading on both Amita and Sabal and what they're actually fighting for. I did not want to fight for either of them. I would have liked if there were an option to fight for a country free from them both. Now I know that this is not always possible, but it would have been nice. But this is just my opinion and you might love the story so don't think too much of it and go play it to figure it out for yourself!

The beginning is hard in terms of staying alive, finding your gun bestie and figuring out what everything is, just keep playing and I promise you it will get better!

Happy Hunting Ya'll!!

The gameplay was extended new features were added like grappling hook, revised hunting (no more hunting deers with a RPG-7) etc.. Graphics wise the game still looks beautiful after all these years, it aged well.

The story might seem basic at first but if you notice the red flags througout the game you're gonna realize who the real villan is. I disliked the story at first, felt a bit boring but after the my recent playthrough I found the story to be good along with the characters. Although there are some annoying, the game would-be-better-without-them characters. Also if you want to learn more about the background lore I recommend to collect Mohan's diaries as they greatly expand the story.

--------Word of warning!-------------------------------------------------------
Don't open the map editor. It's going to break your game, you won't be able to launch it afterwards. It is a major issue that Ubisoft never bothered to fix or even tell us. It's going to break the .reg file for Far Cry 4 which is going to cause the game to close every time you open it, making it unplayable, and a simple un and re-install is not going to fix it.

But good news that there is a fix for it. You can download the fix through this link: https://steve.farcry.eu/files/FC4_Steam_StartupFix.zip

Despite this issue I still recommend to buy Far Cry 4. It is an overlooked entry and it only went downhill after this game. As for the DLC, Valley of the Yetis I can recommend but the rest are pretty meh.",1689210423,1689210423,True,1,0,0.511278212070465088,0,True,False,False

Also, when I started the game it did not let me change my settings until the long long cutscene was over, which would have been okay, had the settings not been at the wrong resolution! wtf???
I had a CTD that put me back to the beginning of a quest, which was very annoying. Once again ""checkpoints"" do not save your progress and neither does the game even allow you to do so manually. It's really annoying.
The game has the Wingsuit-Hotkey bound to the sprinting key, which means that when parcouring you can at any time just wingsuit against a wall or off a cliff instead of jumping somewhere.

Then you've played Far Cry 4.
Same game.
Same animations.
Same plot.
Same stuff to do.
Just different map/world.
And now there's a grappling hook to get to some places.

Far Cry 1 & 2 focused on a hero that had military training. So, it made sense they were a ""one man army"". But, for some reason, with Far Cry 3+ they went all ""extreme tourism"". It feels meta, like you're a rich person that paid West World for some ""X-treme adventure holiday!"" package that lets you go around living out your fantasy of being an extreme super soldier / hiker / adventurer.

""Would you like the 'white savior' sub-plot for an additional $1000 credits, Mr. Quaid?""
""Sure, why not.""
""How do you like your women, Mr. Quaid?""
""Sassy. Domineering. Like I have to prove something to them while they don't have to prove anything to me. (getting sleepy) But, I also want to be their alpha male.""

(I know, I'm mixing West World and Total Recall analogies together. It's a hodge-podge, just like this game.)

The heroes in 3 & 4 have no indication of military training. But, they are instant experts in anything they pick up that shoots of blows stuff up. Meanwhile, you're going up against enemies that have supposedly had some military training. But, they're easily slaughtered, and no match for a person that has no skill or background in soldiering.

The games play this off as ""oh, you're just a natural! A natural soldier! A natural killer!""

Again, feels like what a rich person would want to hear during their West World fantasy vacation.

And what's with all the ""savior complex"" all of a sudden?

Far Cry 1 had you stopping some mad scientist. Not the most original plot. But, oh well.

Far Cry 2+ are all about you being the ""chosen one"" that's railroaded into saving some oppressed people from an oppressor. All their armies and guerrilla tactics couldn't overthrow their oppressors. But, you, some rando that comes along, will ""one man army"" them to victory. It was entertaining in Far Cry 2. It was delirious but passable in Far Cry 3 as a ""rich boy's"" fantasy. But, by the time we get to it being repeated in Far Cry 4, it's wearing thin.

If you haven't noticed, my biggest aggravation is the repetitiousness of it all. There's little innovation from Far Cry 3 to Far Cry 4.

They reused a lot of animations (eg: climbing, searching bodies, etc).
They reused a lot of weapons.
The enemies look darn-near the same as Far Cry 3 (red clothes and all).
There's a nut-job Vas replacement, but not as entertaining.

The graphics are the same, yet have some how gotten a little worse. Maybe it's because Far Cry 3 was in a lush jungle environment that had colors that popped while Far Cry 4 is in the mountains with more drab colors. But, it feels like they got rid of fresnel lighting that was helping add ""body"" to things when seen at an extreme angle. Feels like the specular lighting is... odd. I can't quite put my finger on it. But, it's not as nice-looking at Far Cry 3 even when cranked to Ultra settings.

They included some Nvidia-only settings like soft shadows, enhanced god rays, etc. I have an Nvidia 2040 super, and when I tried the Nvidia-only awesome settings.. they didn't work. They disabled the feature that was supposed to work. So, I had to turn it all back to regular settings.

So, with all this bagging on the game, why do I recommend it?

Because, like other Far Cry games, it's a ""summer popcorn movie"" / switch your brain off game.

I come home from a long day at work, and I just want to switch my brain off and go shoot things in the face. Far Cry 4 accomplishes that. The familiarity of it from Far Cry 3 means I was able to get into it easier without much learning curve. The bog-standard ""kill this, collect this, etc"" busy work that dots the landscape can be ignored or engaged with as you see fit. The game is filled with ""hundreds of hours of game play!"" but most of it is repetitious scavenger hunts or respawnable ""kill this convoy, kill this messenger"" junk. You can knee-jerk react to it and go do it on a whim, or just ignore it and go find something else to do. The game world is your sandbox play ground.

I just wish they had innovated a bit more rather than produce what essentially looks like a reskinned DLC for Far Cry 3.",1688485164,1688485164,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I get why people say is just 3 again, if you compare the evolution in the next 2 titles. However, is much refined than 3.

Pros: 
+They keep the interesting villain trough the game.
+Visuals, still looks beau in 2023, specially now that cards can easily output it to max.
+Gameplay loop still engaging, don't care what Redditers say about clouded Ubisoft UI, its functional and keeps you getting at it.

 Cons:
-The story, really, if I opted for the most sensible choice the game ends in 15 min. (which is funny that is an option), why would my character really care about a revolution he just heard about from strangers? plus both leaders of the golden path are as bad as the main villain. 
-By the end I did grew tired of climbing towers, at first was not so bad and I think I left only 3 untouched as I wanted to wrap thing up, but was the same in FC3.
-Lacks variety in the setting, most areas look the same.

Unfortunately, they never did much to improve upon the original formula.  Each game is just a new region re-skin, with a map repopulated with items to collect and similar things to do.

The story is good, but there's not enough of it in comparison to the level of collecting required to clear the map.  I wasn't able to press on through the campaign to completion because of it.  My biggest complaint by far though is the crashing without any auto-save.  I lost hours of progress one time due to a crash, and immediately quit the game, never to return.

He's partially based on Kakihara from Ichi the Killer. This is confirmed, and it's very fun to know that someone at Ubisoft watched Ichi the Killer and then decided it was both a normal and good idea to base the game's antagonist off of a character from it.

I generally like the progression in Far Cry 4. There are a lot of different avenues towards expanding your arsenal, making money, leveling up, and becoming more powerful in other ways. 

Story is pretty interesting. There are a bunch of different questlines. I like the quests where you enter the tapestries and control the ancient warrior in Shangri-La. The bow is cool, and I like having a tiger companion. 

The helicopter that respawns right next to a fast travel outpost was a mistake though. It made exploration entirely trivial as soon as you unlocked that outpost, which is in the first region of the game.

Personally, I wasnt a big fan of the geography of Kyrat, it felt so copy paste all over, you could barely tell what corner of the map you were on without looking at the map, same goes for the villages. However, where Far Cry 4 makes up for all this is in its story, and the amount of culture makes this fictional country feel so REAL! Im not too familiar with Himalayan culture, so im not sure if they just utilised parts of their culture and ported it in, but either way it definitely aids the game. What kept me going was learning more about Kyrat culture, and the struggle between keeping old tradition vs new, a heavy theme in this game. The story, and more specifically Pagan Min, was such an interesting character to me, especially how he treats you throughout the game. He's clearly always aware of your actions, seeing you kill his people, his territory he stole, and at times even acknowledges it, but still has an odd form of caring for you. He doesn't even hide when he tries to manipulate you, he knows youre aware and plays with it, teasing you almost like old friends. id love to see more of pagan min, im definitely checking out his far cry 6 dlc when i get that game. overall, its an alright game, i wouldnt recommend it for more than Ten Dollars however, as, especially if youve played a ubisoft game before, itll feel a bit stale in terms of gameplay.",1687489158,1687489158,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Without the story all the missions are basically the same : sneak into the enemy base, take some shit from the enemy, kill or fight some dude. The story is stereotypical : a normal dude wants to thrown ashes of her mother in an unknown country. He meets a ""bad psycho dude"" who is stereotypically evil. He suddenly meets the ""good people"" and finds out that he is a son of ""great leaders of some ISIS, oh sorry, I mean of some freedom fighters"". Later he finds that he is the chosen one who fights and kills like Chuck Norris. Add to this arcade shooting,  normally trivial AI and some ""superficially crazy characters like the priest"". But it´s like they try to cover the absence of detailed conversation using phrases from the Bible to make it like ""wow, so profound"" . The main character is just an observer of the ""freak show"". The writer of the game tries to add some drama or ""dilemma situations"" between the generals of the Kyrat, but it´s not worth to pay attention. Because only in the end the dilemma  of choosing paths between ""tradition"" and ""progress with drugs"" will have some effect or will change the ending related to the country. Ubisoft will just sell you in the end an actual propaganda about ""drug state is bad"" and ""traditions are bad too"". Lib agenda. 

The gameplay is a copy-paste with better graphics. Basically you just want to finish the game and forget it. Far Cry 3 has more interesting story even thought the main character and his friends are just some childish golden youth. So without a good story the open world is useless. I don't know for what you need an open world? Just to hunt animals and to kill convoys x10 times? Wild animals attacks you too often. To cover the emptiness? To make it feel that to live in the world is harder? In some games it´s interesting to play secondary missions or to read some papers/diaries, but here nothing is interesting after completing a secondary mission once. Even the main missions sometimes feels like secondary. AI difficulty is based only in the accuracy of their shooting and there is no improvement from the Far Cry 3. Some secondary missions have bugs (You can't complete it). 


Also ubisoft wants you to create a useless account in their useless ubisoft connect. 

Can´t recommend a game that creates a feel of just wanting to finish the game as fast as possible.

The game is fun, Guns are a bit samey, but I got through all the side missions and saved all the Towers and Outposts, so at the end I had a Machine gun that could shoot down helicopters in 2 seconds, and I could kill the toughest enemies in 5 shots, I had a heat seeking rocket launcher that would rain hell when ever used, and both reloaded faster than the AK you get at the start. End game was like being the God of Death, and Like Far Cry 3, I enjoyed the really basic narrative of video game violence being applied to a real person. You killed 1,000 men to get to the end, you have rained fire from the sky, but was your goals really worth it? It's easy to say in a video game that it is, but for a real person?

I find myself enjoying the Far Cry games. I liked how the villian in this one, Pagan Min, seemed to understand your whole violence against and seem to not even be angry about it, even when he faced his certain doom. Pagan also doesn't get replaced by some nobody later, so it's better than previous entries in that regard.

Finally, I get to my actual gripes.

First, This game crashes every 30 minutes if you don't install the game on the same drive as the Ubisoft launcher. It also requires that you go into your graphics card settings and increase the pre-rendered frames to 3, which drops texture quality so the game doesn't run like it's trying to run the game on a potato from 2005. You can't use any fancy graphics card tech either, it's a mess. The game should run alot better considering it's a AAA, high profile release game. This is the only fix too, and if you look through all the guides to fix everything, it points to ubisoft releasing a crappy port and not doing anything to make it run better out of the box, instead you have to spend half an hour fixing their game. AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL

final, screw third party launchers to launch my game. Awful practice.

I would recommend this if the game worked out of the box, but I can't recommend it now.",1644295871,1686249717,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have played the game to 100 % completion three times and have 200 hours in it, which shows that one can definitely fall in love with Kyrat and play this game multiple times, if one wishes to do so. However - and this is based upon my 200 hours in it - there definitely are quite some bugs in this game, but if you look passed this, you will have a great time.

If you are a fan of Single Player games, this one is for you. 

If you are more into co-op, Far Cry 4 only allows you to attempt outposts and other aspects but not the story, which in my opinion is very sad, but was luckily fixed in the future games of the series.

However, if you are a fan of the co-op mode, I highly recommend the DLC 'Valley of the Yetis', which I have played through three times, as it takes place in an entirely new location and with a short but sweet story and is lots of fun to play together.

This was my second Far Cry game I ever played, after Far Cry 3, so I might be a little biased. Also, ever since Far Cry 3, I think Ubisoft has created a trend where the protagonist actually works for the villain, and this is game is very much that.

The Story:

You play as Ajay Ghale, an American-Kyrati man, who served in the US Army with the 82nd Airborne Division, going back to his birthplace, Kyrat, to fulfill his mother's dying wish: ""Take Me to Lakshmana"", and gets tangled into a civil war started by The Golden Path, against the dictator Pagan Min. Now, Pagan knows Ajay Ghale, since both his parents were related to Golden Path, and Ishwari, Ajay's mother, was romantically entangled with Pagan, while working undercover for Mohan Ghale, Ajay's father. Golden Path's new leaders, Sabal and Amita, want Ajay's help to reunite Kyrat and gain Independence from Pagan's rule, through two very different idealogies. Sabal is a right-winger, Amita is a left-winger, and you decide the fate of Golden Path, by deciding who leads it (PS, both are idiots, although Amita is sexier). Within all this politics, Pagan Min regularly keeps contacting you to parle with him, but Ajay is dissillusioned, and is hell bent on killing Pagan for killing his father (who, later revealed, was also an idiot).

Pagan is an amazing character, the 3 other bosses, are also amazing characters and brilliantly acted out, especially Noore, who is possibly the most beautiful video game woman ever created, Yuma is hot, and De Pleur is downright terrifying. Amita and Sabal are terrible characters, and I hate them from the core of my heart. But Amita's ""honey pot"", due to her great looks, make her the better character. Plus. she does have a decent plan for furthering Kyrat's economy, although a bit dictator-ish like. Side characters like Yogi, or Longinus are.. fine, and have small little drug induced side quests that are very entertaining.

Agent Huntley makes a return, and provides with 3 action-packed missions that make you feel like James Bond, also low-key reiterating the mid-air plane hijacking sequence from GoldenEye, which GREAT!

Gameplay:

Its Far Cry 3.5, with all the Ubisoft tropes, towers, outposts, so many damn sidequests, and a skill tree progression system. New features include the ability to ride elephants, a mini-copter, and a grapple, that allows you to act like Lara Croft from Tomb Raider Anniversary, while you're killing fauna all around the map.

Graphics:

It looks AMAZING! Even pushing settings to High makes you realize, this game is a Looker! The performance is mid-tier, however, on modern systems. It appears to be Thread 3 bound, so I'd suggest using a super fast CPU, disabling E-cores, and disabling hyper-threading through Process Lasso, and hope to make it past 60 FPS. Even an i7 11800H, I was CPU-bound, and the game regularly dropped to 35-40 FPS. The only way to make it GPU bound was by pushing 4x MSAA on my RTX 3050, which makes no sense.
The same issues are present in most 2011-2015 Ubisoft games, including AC2/3/4, Far Cry 3/BD, and Watch Dogs etc, so you have been warned.",1684334115,1684334115,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It was so low-stakes and not investing at all. Unless you do the secret ending, you end up split between two religious kooks infighting over how to overthrow the country which is canonically none of your business, you're just there to spread ashes.

3 was and forever will be a masterpiece, even if you didn't care for the characters, you still had some cool gameplay to back it up, this is the same as that, though the only good character I might say is the antagonist, Pagan Min, and he doesn't even get as much limelight as Vaas did, and Vaas was the mid-game boss! 

Maybe it didn't particularly catch me, maybe I just wasn't captivated as some others were. I watched the endings on youtube. And good god am I glad I did. Every ending is bitter sweet.

Graphics: 9/10 - It looks great for a 2014 title. The setting and artistic direction makes for a very aesthetically pleasing experience. The mountains are gorgeous, The wildlife is rich and flavorful, the culture and religious figures are fascinating, and the drug induced scenes use colours beautifully to create a fantasy like experience.

Mechanics: 7/10 - The game doesn't really bring anything new or interesting to the table, it's just a standard shooter with standard shooter mechanics. That said it's well polished, glitch free (in my experience anyway) and what else can you really ask for? We don't always have to reinvent the wheel.

Story 8/10: Pagan Min is a great villain. There's an interesting complexity in his personality between flamboyant and menacing that makes for a memorable character.

Update (4/5/2023):
A new update for the game was released, and unsurprisingly it broke the game for a lot of users, but thankfully someone found a fix.
I quote:
""One of the changes is removing the distribution.steam file from the game, for whatever reason this file is necessary.

To fix this, simply open notepad and click save as on an empty document, save it as distribution.steam with ""All Files"" selected for Save as Type.

Be sure to save it to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Far Cry 4\bin or whatever your Far Cry 4 game's directory is.

Once the file is saved into the folder, the game should run normally again.

The .steam is the EXTENSION of the FILENAME: distribution

MAKE SURE to place the distribution.steam in the Far Cry 4 BIN Folder.

Far Cry 4 boasts visually stunning graphics that bring the beautiful landscapes of Kyrat to life. The attention to detail in the game world is impressive, with lush forests, snow-capped mountains, and vibrant wildlife creating a realistic and immersive environment. The character models are well-designed, and the facial animations are top-notch, adding depth to the story and making the characters feel alive.

The audio in Far Cry 4 is equally impressive, with a rich and dynamic soundscape that enhances the gameplay experience. The voice acting is superb, with convincing performances from the cast, and the atmospheric sounds of the wilderness, gunfire, and explosions create a sense of immersion that draws players further into the game world.

[b] Storyline (8/10) [/b]
The story of Far Cry 4 is intriguing and takes players on a journey filled with political intrigue, rebellion, and personal vendettas. Players assume the role of Ajay Ghale, a young man who returns to Kyrat to fulfill his mother's dying wish, only to get caught in the middle of a civil war between the oppressive regime of Pagan Min, the self-proclaimed king of Kyrat, and the rebellious Golden Path.

The story is filled with memorable characters, each with their own motivations, and players must make difficult choices that impact the outcome of the game. The writing is well-crafted, with a balance of serious moments and dark humor, and the plot twists keep players engaged throughout the game. However, the pacing could be improved in some areas, and the story occasionally takes a backseat to the action and exploration.

[b] Gameplay (9/10) [/b]
Far Cry 4 offers a vast open-world environment that is a playground for exploration and action. Players can traverse the diverse terrain of Kyrat using various vehicles, such as cars, helicopters, and even elephants. The gameplay offers a wide range of activities, including stealthy takedowns, intense firefights, and challenging puzzles.

The combat system is fluid and satisfying, with a wide array of weapons and tools at the player's disposal. Players can craft their own equipment, upgrade their skills, and recruit allies to aid them in their battles. The game also features a dynamic ecosystem, with wildlife that can be hunted for resources, adding an element of survival and strategy to the gameplay.

One of the highlights of Far Cry 4 is the freedom it gives players to approach missions and challenges in their own way. The game offers multiple paths and options, allowing players to choose their playstyle, whether it be stealthy, aggressive, or a combination of both. The open-world also offers a plethora of side activities, such as hunting, racing, and liberating outposts, which add to the replayability and extend the overall gameplay experience.

However, the game does suffer from some minor issues, such as occasional glitches and AI inconsistencies, which can break immersion and disrupt gameplay flow. The driving mechanics could also be improved, as some vehicles feel clunky and hard to control.

[b] Overall Experience (9/10) [/b]
Far Cry 4 is an epic open-world adventure that offers a captivating story, stunning graphics, engaging gameplay, and a vast, immersive game world to explore. The game's freedom of choice, along with its dynamic gameplay mechanics, keeps players engaged for hours on end. The game's minor issues do not significantly

Playing Far Cry 4 is like taking a vacation to an exotic land where you can do anything you want, as long as it involves shooting things, blowing things up, and running away from wild animals. From the gorgeous mountain landscapes to the intense shootouts with enemy soldiers, this game has it all. Just don't forget to pack your rocket launcher and your sense of humor, because you're going to need both.

You can climb radio towers, ride elephants, and engage in all sorts of other absurd activities that have nothing to do with the main plot. But who needs a plot when you have a grappling hook and a flamethrower? 

The villain, Pagan Min, is a fashion icon with a penchant for pink, making him the most fabulous despot you'll ever encounter in a video game. And let's not forget the game's memorable opening scene, where you are asked to wait while the villain goes to take a phone call, leaving you to sit awkwardly at his dining table. This game has it all: action, humor, and a little bit of awkwardness thrown in for good measure.

The graphics in this game are gorgeous. Kyrat is a beautiful, vibrant world filled with lush forests, snowy mountains, and of course, elephants. The attention to detail is very good.

The gameplay is just as great as ever. The shooting feels smooth and satisfying, and the addition of new weapons like the crossbow and the auto-crossbow (because one crossbow just is not enough) keeps things fresh. You can ride elephants into battle and they will smash everything in their path.

The story is a bit hit-or-miss. Pagan Min is a fantastic villain, and his interactions with Ajay are always entertaining.

This is overall a fantastic game. It has got great gameplay, beautiful graphics, and of course, elephants. Pagan Min may be a terrible dictator, but he sure knows how to throw a party.",1680445783,1682169802,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Letting it down monumentally is Co-op.
I want to play this with friends, it's a reason it has co-op.
67 hours in and I've managed 1 hour if that playing co-op.
Continuously crashing out before loading or part way in session, having to sit through that noisy assed loading scren time after time, it's like watching your fav show on TV cranking the volume up to her it, comercial break and waking up half the neigbourhood with a tampax advert, while your trying to take that quick shit you so deapratly needed an hour ago, but the remotes in the living room, not that it would do you any good from the shitter, the dogs the next town over are now howling as the birdseye comercial with the wolves howling is on and your just sat there head in your hands, crying into the toilet paper you just realised you wipped your ass with seconds before.

I'll be pushing to finish it with out 100% completion then uninstalling it, fucking fuming now, done with it.
Just like that shit I was taking.

(*) Charismatic but sadistic villains with no concept of personal space or killing the protagonist when given the chance, 3 standard endings, drugs, supernatural elements, swearing, rape, harrowing cutscenes, collectathons, base assaults, Hurk, Willis, jank and bugginess.

A few notes of warning: The ever-present and unbelievably aggressive animals in this game nearly ruin it. They literally spawn behind you as soon as your turn your back. They can stunlock or instantly kill you, and have so much health that you're forced to carry a LMG and molotovs everywhere to deal with them. I changed my second playthrough difficulty to Easy just because it nerfed the animal damage. The wingsuit will constantly deploy when making even small jumps, instantly killing you. The later Shangri-La quests can also suck a fart out of my @$$ due to difficulty and lack of any meaningful reward.

[h1]The Good[/h1]
+Graphics, sound and music improvements
+Great voice acting
+More exposure to consistent villain with a few redeeming qualities
+Looting/interacting is easier
+Can move bodies now
+Menu design is much better
+Weapon scopes aren't obscured by scratches
+Not quite so many loot stashes
+Many syringe improvements
+Greater mission variety
+Vehicles handle much better
+Skills and weapons gated much better
+Minigames replaced with repeatable missions
+Few missions that made me genuinely LOL
+Can change difficulty any time
+Save anywhere, no real penalty for death
+Can disable each part of UI if you want challenge/immersion

[h1]YMMV[/h1]
~Occasional file corruption issues, requiring file verification
~Still easy to max XP and money early in game
~Animated animal cruelty and areas filled with animal gore
~Drug use and more cheap topless nudity
~Arena is an absolute slog, though the rewards are account-bound
~No steam achievements
~Villain is far more likable than your allies
~Weapon balance issues. Many early weapons outshine late ones.
~Quicktime events still in game, but use a consistent button, which is much easier for KB&M players

[h1]The Bad[/h1]
-POS Ubisoft Connect launcher and Denuvo
-Wingsuit will frequently get you killed
-Second half of game is crashy, buggy mess
-No volume control! Music is either on or off.
-Unskippable splash screens (without modding command line)
-Some missions have unclear objectives or unfair mechanics
-Still can't fully inspect or compare weapons in shops/menus
-Shangri-la missions are pretty horrible
-DLC not integrated into main game like FC3
-Enemy snipers and vehicle gunners are omniscient hitscanners
-Animals are still ridiculously aggressive, bullet-sponge, cage-breaking, stealth-ruining, teleporting-behind-you assholes

...but significantly worse in almost every way. 

Never in my 15+ years of playing video games, has a game ever made me say out loud ""please stop, this isn't fun"", quite this often. It's really and truly THAT bad. 

Let's start with Freedom. This is something that FC4 constantly removes from the player. You have no freedom to do whatever you want, and it's been very frustrating for me. I think of a way to do something, and does it work? No, no it doesn't. 

I can't shoot anyone because this mission is mandatory stealth, if someone sees me I instantly lose the mission. 
I can't stealth in the particular way that I want to, for the same reason. If someone sees me, I instantly lose. There are more ways than one to do stealth. 
I gained access to the northern part of the country, and now it's impossible to do my favorite way of capturing missions - turreted trucks - because there's guaranteed to be multiple enemies carrying rocket launchers now. I instantly die.
I can't melee any enemies because each and every single time I get close to them, they bash me with their gun and I get stun locked. I literally can't do anything, get shot, and die. 
And now, just plain shooting someone has become a huge headache because the moment I get nicked by a single bullet, my entire camera shifts upwards, ruining my aim.

I can't even go anywhere I want sometimes, it keeps telling me I'm going out of bounds when I'm very clearly not. The player should be allowed to go anywhere they want to, whenever they want to. Just don't activate the main missions in that area.

Stealth is atrocious. 

If you shoot someone with a silenced weapon, and you miss, oh well... Every enemy NPC becomes superhuman. They know the exact location the shot came from, they look in your direction, they see you from ludicrously far away, AND THEY CAN SEE YOU THROUGH OBJECTS. 

Trees, vehicles, in one case an entire wall, I have gotten seen when I absolutely should not have. They even try to shoot through the same solid objects they see you through, most noticeably trees. Not only is this a problem, but during their superhuman status, they will also notice you extremely quickly. That little ""vision bar"" fills up nearly instantly, if not literally instantly, if you're in their ginormous field of view.

I tried to force my preferred way of stealth - Loud Stealth, which is using noise and dead bodies to attract enemies away from my position - and it took me two entire hours and I didn't even completely do it. It saved my progress of saving the slaves, but it didn't save any progress I made killing the enemy. The checkpoints in this game are some of the worst I've ever seen, and this is a horrifically beautiful example of how. If I kill people and save a slave, it should also save all the enemies I killed. Basic checkpoint design.

The weapons in this game are better balanced than they were in Far Cry 3, but it doesn't solve the issue that the ones you unlock earliest in the game are pretty much the best weapons you'll have for the rest of the game. It took me all the way to unlocking nearly every single weapon in the game, and there was only 1 weapon for each of my 4 slots I've found to be better than what I immediately had access to from the beginning of the game. This is not okay. Things I unlock, should be better than what I started with.

The graphics are messed up and I can't understand why. There's a forced blur on weapons, and I have absolutely no way of disabling it at all. I've tried following online guides, nothing works anymore. Just nothing. It looks like sh*t. That's not the worst of it, the worst would absolutely be the fact that the game's lighting on weapons is unbelievably bad. I can't enjoy the way my gun looks because it constantly has a shadow casted on it, making almost the entire gun black. I just can't see it, arguably making it a waste of money for me to have bought that skin for it.

The wingsuit is a very good item in concept, but executed awfully in FC4. You press, OR HOLD shift to activate it. HOLD?! YOU CAN HOLD SHIFT?! WHAT???

If you're confused...

When you run and jump, you instinctively HOLD SHIFT during the duration of the jump, don't you? You hold the run button? IT ACTIVATES THE F*CKING WINGSUIT, AND YOU FLY STRAIGHT INTO A WALL AND IMMEDIATELY DIE. Or get needlessly hurt really badly. 

Far Cry 4 also has the exact same problem that Far Cry 3 has - You're not allowed to choose whether you want to physically heal yourself, or use a healing syringe. If I want to heal, no matter what, I use the healing syringe. I am missing 1 bar of health, I don't want to use an item that heals 6 bars of HP to fix that. 

Sometimes when I walk away from an outpost, it instantly starts getting attacked and now I'm forcefully roped into a mission of having to defend the outpost. These suck balls, there are way too many enemies literally everywhere and all I do is die repeatedly in my sad attempts to defend my outpost. I eventually win, but only after dying 5 or so times. It's so stupid it hurts.

Oh, and I can't forget this: Friendly NPCs LOVE to run DIRECTLY in front of your car, you hit them, AND THE GAME PUNISHES YOU FOR IT. IT WASN'T MY FAULT. THEY RAN IN FRONT OF ME... But this never happens with enemy NPCs. They always perfectly run out of the way. So what the hell, are the friendly NPCs just suicidal? God, I don't get it. 

The only genuine improvement that Far Cry 4 has over Far Cry 3, is that the whole place doesn't magically become completely safe after capturing an outpost. There are still enemies roaming around and actually giving you something to do instead of being bored.",1679431355,1679938760,False,2,1,0.506387948989868164,0,True,False,False

The game contains truely lots of unfixed and serious bugs. From the very first start I encountered several of them:First, the game was not launching. Well, I could fix that one after trying several things, but then...Sound would stop right after the intro - every time I would try. A long-standing issue never fixed, widely known through the web. I'm not going to delete windows system files as some suggest as a fix and risk issues with other properly working games or apps. So, for the moment I continued without sound...After many other ""tiny"" issues came the worst, which made me ask for a refund, right after the intro, on the very first area you play, there is someone supposed to throw you a rope when you ""escape"", before actually having completed anything else yet (it's like the first kinda-mission). And this, with several restarts, it just won't trigger. It triggers half of the dialog and the 2nd half - as seen on youtube videos - is when it tells you, he will throw you a rope to climb. If you don't climb up, there is no way to progress. And this 2nd part of the dialog just won't trigger.Borderless mode also just won't work correctly. It shows like half of what should be displayed and the rest is ""outside"" of the monitor. And the windows key is being blocked by the game. Finally, when exiting, it would simply get stuck and the task manager would be the only thing I could bring up more or less up, and that only being usable, after trying to start the game in windowed mode, otherwise I had to hard reboot. Inform yourself, it's widely known that the game suffers from an incredible amount of never fixed bugs, obviously. Had I seen this before or researched a little (it becomes so obvious if one searches, as people even ""joke"" about the many issues this game has), I would had probably never bought it. How can a supposed triple-A game be developed to be so badly done? Must have been really bad, if they didn't fix all that, or maybe, it was so deeply bugged, that it was pointless to even try to do so for Ubisoft.

Some things improved, some things decreased in quality (I'd say traversal and collectables were more fun/less annoying in FC3). The story is about of equal quality, but voice acting significantly improved compared to FC3.

THE GOOD: The villain is really, really well written and acted. Progression and open world mechanics feel nice. Good selection of powerful, nice handling weapons. Missions are fun and don't drag on too long. There are even some winks to FC3 and memes from the period this game launched in. Stealth works well enough, but it's not great. Sometimes you really wonder how the heck you were spotted, or why AI acts so dumb when looking for the murderer of their 20 friends.

THE BAD: One major downfall is that the open world can get highly annoying due to ridiculous amount of living world events. Every 2 seconds somebody is getting killed by an eagle, or honey badgers, or tigers. Or attacked by rebels. Or needs help with their car. Or yells at you for some reason. Or you yourself get attacked. The 2 seconds is not even an overstatement, it is that frequent, and it's highly distracting. I've also had quest givers die from dumb stuff like this, resulting in me conversing with the air, with subtitles but no audible voice lines when I start the quest. 

The ""backup call token"" is the most useless feature ever, can't use it in any situation it would be relevant. 

The main characters Sabal and Amita are annoying as heck and their anger outbursts and bickering make me not wanna help them at all. I don't like either of their characters one bit. The main villain is far more interesting and relatable.

Finally, using the map editor bricks your game. There are also some other major technical issues at times - for example Shangri-La missions tend to completely crash your game on newer hardware (I'm playing on i9/32GB/RTX3070). This makes you have to start over from the beginning with no checkpoints. Those missions nearly made me quit the game, they aren't fun and even less fun when you have constant crashing.",1678755205,1678755341,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The whole point of the story is to overthrow a dictator and install one of two 'freedom fighter' lieutenants as the new leader of this country. Here's the problem: they're both worse than the actual dictator is. One wants to be a heroin kingpin and raise an army of child soldiers, one wants to enslave the country and slaughter opposition. And every time you pick the lesser of two evils you have to listen to the other one bitch at you for 10 minutes for not siding with them.
The villains, save the main one, are all forgettable, too.
But the worst part, the truly worst part of the plot, is that if you go for the secret ending - which is available at the literal start of the game - you find out (spoilers) the protagonist actually not only has much more reason to side with the bad guy, he has great reason to side AGAINST the so-called 'freedom fighters'! The whole purpose of the protagonist coming here is better served joining the enemy!

The story and the combat are pretty decent, and the graphics can be quite breathtaking... But the game suffers from the Ubisoft Syndrome. Exploration is very modular, with each area having a tower you have to climb. Most locations don't seem unique (I get flashbacks to dungeons in Oblivion). When you unlock a tower, the game shows you the locations of interest nearby, and it's often just a shack or two with nothing interesting in it. Combat is repetitive as well, if you've done 2 or 3 fights, you've done it all.

- Addictive gameplay and gunplay
- Wide variety of weapons and equipment
- Great open world with lots of stuff to keep the player busy
- Beautiful graphics, a solid upgrade from the previous title
- Second most iconic antagonist in the franchise
- Different choices impact on the missions the player will do or how will they end
- You can tame and ride elephants (that's 100% a pro in my books)
- Game is very stable (played on a RTX 3050 with an Intel Core i5 9th Gen and a 1080p Full HD monitor), runs at 60 FPS on high at full resolution with very little visual/gameplay bugs, nothing gamebreaking but might impact the realism of the experience (do people still care for realism?)

Cons:
- If compared to Far Cry 3, the story didn't have that great of an impact on the player, but isn't in any way bad
- As it is the same with many (if not all) Ubisoft games on PC, it is tied to the Ubisoft Connect launcher, a con that's already enough for many people to skip many good Ubi titles

The music and wide variety of wildlife and map features serve to complement this and provide a satisfying open world experience. 
Perhaps most importantly, I find the story to be quite a compelling one. Many action games like this seem to centre around a rebellion against a dictatorship, but Far cry 4 is one of the few which shows the consequences of these regime changes, and how easily one tyrant can be replaced by another (an aspect which is helped significantly by the presence of a charismatic villain). The player has a direct hand in the course of the story, and while the game does not have RPG levels of choice, the player can at certain points take actions which will impact the overall course of the story. In short, some of your actions will have lasting consequences in this game.
The game is not perfect. I find the liberation of camps in the game to be quite repetitive (although the presence of ""fortresses"" in the game alleviates this somewhat by providing more unique and challenging liberation sections). That said, the dynamic open world still offers a lot of fun activities for players, and many locations to explore. Furthermore, the I personally find that the progression system fits an acceptable balance between being too fast and too slow for the character to upgrade along with the course of the game. A similar thing can be said about the weapons, which generally become available at the right time in the game, and the crafting system, which encourages exploration of the map without being too tedious. 
Overall, I feel the mix of a compelling story and a rich open world environment makes far cry 4 truly memorable, and I have revisited the game many times. I would say that this game is worth a playthrough.",1677521778,1677521778,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Seriously, fuck the eagles and whoever was in charge of the open world encounters in this game, he needs to have an eagle shoved up his ass and be sent far away from any game development related job. I suggest ornithologist, what with the weird obsession / phobia of eagles. Whoever is this creep, he needs to step away from whatever position he holds in Ubi and really go do something else, preferably far away from people.

The eagles are one of the most annoying enemies in video-games in general, they are fairly small flying enemies that generally attack from the back / blind spot, they are extremely aggro, they spot you long before you can spot them and there is generally no warning. Furthermore, there is about a trillion of them around the map at any given time.

Want to got to mission, go towards a vehicle. Eagle attack.
Get into car, drive to location. Eagle attack.
Start mission, go to target location. Eagle attack.
Finish mission. Eagle attack.
Need to hunt some animals for drops to upgrade, go to animal location, sneaking around to get as many as I can quickly. Eagle attack. All animals run off.
Go to different location. Eagle attack, all animals run off.
Repeat multiple times. Multiple eagle attacks, give up on hunting, go free an outpost instead.
Sneaking into outpost to get clean clear. Eagle attack. Enemies alerted, call reinforcements, get swarmed and die.
Repeat a couple times, couple eagle attacks later give up and go looking for loot chests. Multiple eagle attacks.
Money items gathered, drive to a trader to sell the loot. Eagle attack.
Get out of trader location. Eagle attack.
Go to one of the map reveal towers. Three eagle attacks.
Scale the tower, reveal map locations, go down. Eagle attack.
Hide inside a house because I have to step away from the PC. Come back to NPCs outside the house being attacked by an eagle.
Walk around. Eagle attack.
Take a breath. Eagle attack.
Blink. Eagle attack.
Live. Eagle attack.
Die. Eagle attack.
Eagle attack. Eagle attack.

The rest of the game is fine. It's your generic decent Ubi game, about 7/10, just the bare minimum you would expect from an AAA game. As with the rest of the games, the main issue with FC4 is not the derivative design, it's the fact that even after so much time and tons of games with the same design, they still have the same issues - the general lack of technical polish, janky physics, extremely basic and limited drive model for the vehicles, grindy crafting/progression that is forced on you if you want to carry more than one weapon, two magazines of ammo and a chump change barely enough to buy ammo.

The shooting is okay, the gun selection is okay, the combat balance is okay for the most part with a couple unnecessary bullet sponge enemies as in almost every Far Cry, and so on. 

As mentioned, it's nothing special, except the fucking eagles, and those are not a good addition.

Anyways, if you can grab it under 10 bucks/eur (or whatever your equivalent of 5 cheeseburgers worth is), go for it. Now excuse me while I go commit mass eaglecide.",1677509140,1677509140,False,5,15,0.540463149547576904,0,True,False,False

This game through me for a loop. I really like the core gameplay elements, except the hunting, but the game did not feel as fun and engaging as it could have been. This is my first experince with a far cry game (I bought far cry 3 and above) so I'll update this review to compare them to this one. I just can't find myself recommending this game at full price. I however got it for something like 90% off during a winter sale which I recommend anyone looking for this game do. I've been wanting to expand my gaming experince and decided to start with the far cry franchise (along with some other games which I will be reviewing as I play). Overall I had a decent time with this game. Here is my review.
Things I like about the game (pros)
- Good Shooting mechanics, felt fun to play
- Fun weapon and shop system (though tedious) 
- Good setting 
- Open world 
- Fun to mess around
- Great stealth mechanics (felt very fun to use stealth though you could just shoot everything and be fine) 
- Good villan 
Things I dont like about the game (cons) 
- Lackluster story 
- Empty open world
- Hunting is required to progress the game (ik that is kinda the point but I didn't like it) 
- Chracters lacked depth
- Thrown into the world without much explanation 
- Not much flexibility in playstyles 
- DLC not worth it/not very fun 
- Kind of grindy to complete main quests 
- Lack luster prologue  
- Not much replayability 
- Felt like a worse Just Cause game

Overall I had a fun time but I don't recommend this game at full price. I only enjoy this game for the sake of trying to expand my gaming taste and experinces. 5/10 for me",1677281805,1677466913,False,1,0,0.506387948989868164,0,True,False,False

Far Cry 4 is definitely one of my favorites in the series. It took everything what made Far Cry 3 fun (minus the radio towers) and built upon it. Open world freedom, use whatever gun you want from a huge assortment, do whatever mission you want, it's all up to you. All of that in the beautiful Himalaya mountains. Oh yeah and you gotta take out a flamboyant, discount Vaas Montenegro called Pagan Min.

There are some weird things though like people doing the most random-ass ѕhit besides the road and all animals want to kill you, but arguably this is just amusing.

One big downside is that co-op is horrible, don't even try it. You can only do small missions and raid outposts together. Anything story-wise is singleplayer only. On top of that, connecting to each other doesn't work most of the time because it's Uplay. A complete miss on that department.

The thangka missions give Far Cry 4 a different flavor that players can respect to distinguish from the other series. The buzzsaw is OP, and so once you obtain it, it feels hard to let go of it and you end up progressing the mid-late game in a more Rambo-style fashion. It limits creativity. I used to rely on takedowns and careful strategies when taking outposts. But as soon as I get my hands on a Buzzsaw, then it really doesn't matter what I'm facing.

[b]1. Personal Opinion:[/b]
I first knew of this game on youtube, this game introduced me into the Far Cry franchise, back at 2014... Now, I've already played every single Far Cry, and this one is still my favourite one.

There's something on this game that tells me, this is Far Cry... Multiple endings and variations of the same endings, a hidden plot behind everything, multiple ways to do things, stealth, silence, unseen, ghost. As well as rushing, explosions, gunshots, powerfire, artillery or simply bait and wildlife... This is Far Cry.

I enjoyed Far Cry, Far Cry 2, Far Cry 3 and Far Cry 5 a lot, but the 4th one, for me, is still the best, there's no other reason for having played this game 17 times... [not a joke]


[b]2. Pros:[/b]
- Great, inmersive, complex and misterious story
- Adictive gameplay: Freedom, your choices matter, AI [b]is[/b]* a threat, choose your way to do things
- Extremely great, inmersive, suitable and perfect OST. [spoiler]LOVE THE LAST MISSION SONG ""THE RIVER"" it means more than you can imagine the first time you hear it when you hear it[/spoiler]

- Choices you make will alter the story course [spoiler](but you'll get the same ending options no matter what you've elected, with just some variations on dialogs).[/spoiler]

- Cooperative Mode.
- Ultra easy to adquire all the achievements on Uplay

*[spoiler]AI is a threat if you play it accordingly, I mean, AI will adapt to your actions but you can easily overpower it (when on early and mid game) with unlocked late game weapons that you might encounter on some side missions.[/spoiler]


[b]3. Cons:[/b]
- While not doing missions, gameplay can turn boring, not really though there are always tons of things to do, but if you're a ""mission mainstream"" player then: hook up some friends and do crazy things
- You'll need a low-medium specs pc to enjoy this game, get a high one if you can, you'll enjoy it. 
-You can't do principal missions in cooperative mode
-Buggisoft greatness is ultra present in this game, there are some bugs that will nerve you out, and some other will make you die laughing

Well... truthfully I have been alittle Far cryed out over the years, I completed a ton of time in 2, then 3 and now 4...

My big issue is 4 feels very.. very similar to 3, the gun play, graphics, AI and overall mission design, hunting for animal pelts and collecting random junk to sell... liberating towers and outposts...

To the f*cking T this game walks the Far Cry line, it never deviates to surprise the player.

Overall its the same old fun but unfortunately.. for me, it's Far to same same with no exciting fleshed out lore or story to care about

I've completed it 4 or 5 times and I still love it as much as I did on my first playthrough. This is quite possibly the best setting in any game I've played. The rich culture and beautiful scenery of Kyrat helps make this an immersive experience that keeps the player interested at all times. Yes the graphics are starting to show their age now, but I still maintain the idea that this game is beautiful. Ajay is an interesting protagonist and he's a lot more likable than Jason in my opinion. The voice acting is very solid and helps bring each of the characters to life. The gameplay is typical Far Cry, which is brilliant. My only gripe with the gameplay is the return of radio towers; I'm glad this is the last game they make an appearance in. The story is very interesting, I like how you are presented with the choice of backing Amita or Sabal and how your choices lead to different mission objectives. There are far more guns than there were in Far Cry 3, including more signature weapons, which have special attributes and mods. Overall, I'd give this game a 9/10. It's a must play for Ubisoft fans and anyone who loves first person shooters.

Valley of the Yetis DLC:
Definitely worth a playthrough if you enjoyed the main game. The story is pretty much nonexistent, but it's engaging enough to make the whole playthrough interesting. Gameplay is identical to the main game, no new weapons or combat skills were added unfortunately. The relay defense missions are fun, as is the relay station upgrade system. The yetis are rather underwhelming unfortunately. Even on the hardest difficulty, I never died to one. Still a fun, worthwhile experience in my opinion.

Farcry 4 is a smooth and amazing game, this version have much stable system compare to Farcry 3, encounter several hard crush on Farcry 3, have a bad taste in mouth.

this game offer a lot of vehicle and weapons for use, there are tons of replay value even if you just mess around, the main story however is poorly design that tacky, really hard to get into the story, two child like leader arguing is not a well written plot, at the end or other path the developer offer many choice, you could kill for spared this kind of option many times.

with the wild animal and the whole environment system that developer create, made this game not just a video game but life in it's like wild life that living, the sad part is you have to run two platform at same time, which time consume and a clumsy to start the game.

for a few title, like the Farcry 4 is the few example, it's a pack all content in one, and ending or choice which give it replay value, some missing like the achievement, but I still playing till end, it's a good example how the modern game company should follow",1525852109,1674322178,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

This game is very interesting and i loved this game i highly recommend it for people who love the other far cry games. I started 2023 with a classic because this is like far cry in its roots and i enjoyed how they set up this story because its starts with a guy named Ajay Ghale and hes in a country called Kyrat around the Himalayas mountains which is a great setting to put this game in. Ajay is in the country to fulfil his mothers dying wish which you end up meeting Pagan Min the antagonist to this game and he captures you to a dinner but honest he ends up not being a bad villain because he ends up being really nice to you and have a great relationship with you and wants to help you fulil your mothers wish. This game is great for 2014 when it came out and has a lot of action packed and exciting things to do in the game which can go from killing animals to fun take downs on Pagans men.

People call this a FC3 reskin, and honestly, though I'd disagree, I don't think that's a bad thing. FC3 was a great game. The QoL updates this one got made it so going back to 3 is a bit disappointing.

Graphically, I love this updated FC3 look, as well. The setting lends well to sweeping landscapes, lush forests, and snowy scenes. The newer games with the new UI just feel worse. Even 6, which I enjoy so far in the demo, has the same boxy, changed feeling that made me loathe 5 off the bat (before the storyline and scant, boring feeling took over).

My only gripe with this game is that it has to be played through UPlay/Ubisoft Connect. I wouldn't even mind that if launching it didn't necessitate both Steam and Connect running since I bought it here. As much as I'd love to just play it from Steam, I'd much rather play it from just Connect than needing both. There are way too many shortcuts to accidentally step on with all the software I have running. But anyway, that's not this games fault. It's still part of the experience, though.

Overall, this game has a lot of replay-ability. I still roam around with the UI off and every so often reset the outposts because it's so fun. I wouldn't do that in any game but this one. 3 is missing QoL updates, 5 is boring to me, and 6's setting doesn't quite make me wanna roam around like this one.",1673745243,1673745243,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There's tons of content and the gameplay is definitely fun enough on its own to justify a purchase. I think what really stands out about this game compared to others in the franchise is the world building, it is so far above and beyond that of the other games in the series that none come even remotely close. Even if Far Cry isn't about the story, having a truly fleshed out world and characters really added to my enjoyment. Kyrat has a beautiful, unique geography, as well as its own culture, economy, and politics. Pagan Min is easily my favorite villain from the Far Cry series, and the faction you fight for is also one of the most nuanced I've seen. Even so, the story never overstays its welcome or distracts from gameplay. There's also lots of replayability through the arcade and arena once you beat the main story, as well as many side missions. 

That's not to say this game is perfect. Here are my biggest pet peeves:
1) Things get kind of buggy in the second half of the game. Generally, this wasn't a big issue though.
2) The wingsuit can be quite annoying to use, especially because the button to activate it is the same as the sprint button by default. I died many times to accidentally opening my wingsuit when I didn't mean to and I eventually learned to stop holding shift any time I jumped.
3) The arena is painfully grindy. There's one signature weapon that can only be attained by reaching level 10 in the arena. At first it wasn't so bad, but after about level 5, it took an obscene amount of time just to go up one level. My 100% Completion Playthrough took around 50 hours, and probably about 5-10% of that time was spent in the arena, which doesn't seem bad until you realize that I spent a LOT of time exploring the map to collect every single loot chest (which doesn't contribute to completion), so grinding the arena could easily take up 10-15% of a 100% completion run that doesn't include the loot chests. Also, there's almost no variation in the arena mode, so for that entire time you'll be playing on the same map against the same waves of enemies over and over and over and over again. It gets tedious very quickly.

TLDR; Far Cry 4 is the best game in the franchise imo, barring a few nitpicks and a very grindy (but optional) arena mode. If you enjoy open world games and/or first person shooters, I would highly recommend.",1672364703,1672364703,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Having played, and thoroughly enjoyed, FAR CRY 3, I approached FAR CRY 4 with the same willingness to suspend disbelief and was rewarded in so many ways albeit one: the Ending, or should I say Endings (plural). Without hesitation, the graphic quality, the open world, the freedom of play, the weapons, the myriad characters, the MOCAP and the voice performances are all spectacular. 165 hours of game play is a testament to this adjective. As a ""completionist"", I carefully strove to uncover and discover the ultimate outcome of the stated motive of the game: return of the ashes. Thusly, I felt sadly robbed of this satisfaction because of a simple choice made during game play. Without offering spoilers, and knowing that FAR CRY 3 had two endings, I searched on-line and discovered the game had not two, but MULTIPLE endings, all of which were predicated on choices made both earlier in-game, end of campaign, and even post-campaign. Ultimately, having satisfied my need for story-line closure, I have an almost bittersweet recognition and acknowledgement that there are no ideal end solutions, and""choices"" do indeed define our reality, whether day-to-day or immersed in the alternate reality of gaming.

1. The missions are tedious. It's capture this territory, shoot the bad guys, and repeat. There's some collectables too, but again, tedious work for very little reward. There's some hunting quests but they're not very hard. What makes it hard is animal AI, which sucks. 
2. The antagonists just aren't compelling. Without spoiling anything in the game, they're basic textbook bad guys. They technically have a reason for doing what they do but it all boils down to ""I hurt people because it's fun muahahahaha"" ; and that's just not compelling enough to go through such a long game. 
3. The open world is awesome. There's always something hiding somewhere. Unfortunately some areas are locked until a certain progress is met but beggars can't be choosers. However the NPC's do suck and have no substance, they kinda just walk around and repeat the same 10 lines of dialogue. 
4. It's a very long game if you choose to do everything. I didn't do any of the collectables and I still clocked in 45 hours on the base game, and another 5 with DLC. But I like sneaky tactics which can take longer, so I take a little extra time to plan out my assault. 
5. The absolute worst part of the game are the Yoggi and Reggie quests. They're just so dumb. I don't want to spoil. Google it if you're curious. But oh my, I hated every single quest they gave me. My character had zero reason to keep doing the quests and it felt so out of character that it just took me out the game completely.    
6. Even with 50 hours clocked into this game, I'm going to say, Don't buy this. There's a lot of other games you could play that are better than this. It's not even about the money, it's just not worth sinking so much time into. It's not a compelling game. It's just a time sink.",1672201677,1672201677,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The gameplay is fast-paced and intense, with a wide variety of different weapons and abilities to choose from. The game's world is also beautifully realized, with a wide variety of different environments to explore and a dynamic weather system that adds a lot to the atmosphere of the game.

One of the things I love most about Far Cry 4 is the sense of progression you get as you progress through the game. As you complete missions and earn money, you'll be able to upgrade your weapons and abilities, which adds a lot of depth to the gameplay. The game also has a wide variety of different enemies to fight, each with their own unique abilities and behaviors, which keeps things interesting.

The graphics of the game are also a standout feature. The environments are all beautifully detailed, and the character designs are all very unique and interesting. The music and sound effects also add a lot to the atmosphere of the game.

Overall, I highly recommend Far Cry 4 to anyone who enjoys open-world action games. It's a fantastic game that offers a lot of depth and replay value.

It's hardly the innovative leap that FC3 was, but for me it meets the same high standard (more or less), does a good job at differentiating itself, and stays interesting through to the end.

First, straight improvements over Far Cry 3:
+ Better graphics and comparable, if not better, performance.
+ In general, side content is much less spammy. There's both [b]more[/b] variety yet [b]fewer[/b] of each type of mission and collectible, and actual side plots that add a touch of continuity. For example, you can collect Masks of Yalung, tokens of The Goat, a serial killer on a killing spree in the name of the demon Yalung. He leaves notes behind at many of the mask's locations that add some lore; I appreciated having small side plots like this to follow outside the main story. There are also a wide variety of people who give you missions, and for a variety of purposes.
+ More verticality: grappling hooks, buzzers (small personal helicopters), and an early-game wingsuit. They're very natural additions to the Himalayan landscape, and also serve to make the game a bit more exciting. I mean, who doesn't love mowing down soldiers from a helicopter with a Tec-9 or grenade launcher?
+ Now, instead of being obsessed with in-law jokes, the journal is a piece of propaganda from Pagan Min. I like the twist.
+ There is a similar parallel of mystical themes, but it's a very different approach that felt novel, original, and even more immersive than in FC3.
+ You can ride elephants into battle. I can't stress this enough.
+ Mortars.
+ Outposts can be attacked by the Royal Army after you take them. It doesn't happen often, but it adds a little more believability to the war.
+ In some ways, the story was a bit less contrived, i.e. your involvement in the plot is a little more intentional, you're not just a student-turned-mercenary. Kyrat is your birthplace. Pagan Min, the dictator, is your [i]stepdad[/i]. Immediately, the plot has intrigue, and the complexities of family give it depth. Some characters are a bit one-dimensional, but it delivers overall.

A few more neutral comparisons and comments:
• Stealth is a bit harder. Suppressed weapons are more scarce (more on this later), foliage is less dense, and enemies like hunters and snipers can spot you very easily. This is a matter of taste, I did end up going guns blazing much more often, even though I tend to prefer stealth, and I came to enjoy it. Both playstyles are arguably equally viable, which is a lot more than many other games can say. 
• The fauna of Kyrat is much more hostile than that of the Rook Islands, and lots of things try to kill you. This is explained in the game as a result of heroin and rabies, which isn't ridiculous but a bit odd. It was a little annoying early game (fuck eagles and dholes) but less so once you get strong weapons.
• Gun progression is weird. You get access to pretty powerful weapons early in the game, and now a big point of differentiation is availability of attachments. For example, many signature weapons are just some other weapon (which doesn't support attachments) with a full suite of pre-equipped attachments and slightly better stats. I can see why this was done, it forces you to expose yourself and be aggressive early on, but it feels bad to lose the customizability, and it's weird for only weaker guns to have it.
• They kept the cluttery loot system, with random garbage items on bodies worth various amounts of money. It's not that big of a deal, but after seeing that most of the rest of the clutter of FC3 is gone, it's a shame.
• Some of the interaction hitboxes are obnoxious. It seems to be less common than in FC3, but still present. The worst offender I found was a note that could only be read if I crouch-walked right into it and looked at a specific angle. I think that's unacceptably bad.
• Pagan Min is not as unique as Vaas. He's very similar to Handsome Jack, similarly morbid, but less funny. That said, he makes up for it in certain ways ([spoiler] You instigated, not him! He kinda wasn't the bad guy! Well, yes, he's a horrible person, but so are Amita and Sabal![/spoiler]), and he obviously has more complexity and depth (than Vaas).

And, now, the problems:
- I have the game set to fullscreen. When I click to start the game, the game exits fullscreen, and I have to re-fullscreen it. I made sure to learn the shortcut for that (Shift+Enter) because I had to do it [b]twice, every single time I launched the game[/b]. Tabbing in and out, and weirdly enough, certain interactions in the menu, caused similar behavior.
- Advice: DISABLE BOTH LOOTING ANIMATIONS AND NOTIFICATIONS. Although the animations are pretty decent, they take WAY TOO LONG. When you're looting after a firefight and you have sit through a solid minute of animations every time, it gets old fast. And, nearly all of the item names are irrelevant, so you don't have to see them anyway.
- Similarly, notifications last way too long. If you unlock/pick up/etc a lot of things in a short time frame, the notifications can lag really far behind. Worst case, I've picked up a journal entry and was able to finish a mission before I was prompted 'Press M to read'. It's very, very annoying to have to wait for a game menu to catch up to you.
- Following missions exist.
- Outpost Master and Kyrati Films missions that you complete don't show any visual change on the minimap, only when you physically walk up to the mission table to accept it. I lost track after beating a few outposts, and that was annoying enough that I decided they just weren't worth doing.
- I find it really irritating that gun stats only exist as a sliding scale without any numbers, and weapon comparison shows bars that I didn't find immediately intuitive (white and red, but does that mean white = the highlighted one is better, or white = the one being hovered over is better?). Also, you can't compare weapon stats across tabs in the shop, so I had to take pictures of my screen to be able to see the stats side by side. Once I had a lot of signature weapons available this got really annoying.
- The buzzer is a literal helicopter, so it makes sense that it has very dangerous blades. It even makes sense that if you make a misstep, you can be decapitated by the blades. However, it's ridiculous how many times I've died due to this. When you dismount, you stand just under the edge of the blades, so if you land on any uneven surface, the buzzer may settle, tip, and instantly kill you. There's no way to turn the engine off before dismounting, so if you land on some rocks and start in the wrong direction, you may just die.
- The wingsuit was a hazard. You get the option to deploy it whenever you're midair at least ~6-8 feet above the ground, and deploying the wingsuit and sprint both use SHIFT. I like to press sprint mid-air to hit the ground running, and this led me to accidentally deploy my wingsuit fairly often. This isn't the worst thing, except way too many times that caused me to ""crash"" and instantly die, despite [b]not even being high enough up to take fall damage[/b]. Similar is true for the parachute.
- Random bugs and more than one annoying crash.
- Karma levels and skill levels both run out way too early, the upgrades basically stop 50-75% of the way through the game. The fact that there are [b]tens[/b] of levels just dedicated to boosting syringe duration comes off as really lazy design. They are also two huge incentives to do side content, and they become irrelevant mid-game.
- The [spoiler]Yogi and Reggie[/spoiler] missions become a bit stale, and there's not even that many.
- The elephant in [spoiler]Shangri-La Thangka #4[/spoiler] is BUGGY AS HELL and would teleport out from under me and de-aggro. It's also necessary to ride it to progress through one part, but it wasn't communicated well and I ended up restarting the mission.

When I first played I do not think I was as aware of what's going on, however considering many peoples criticisms of this game that are much older than me even now, I think have yet to touch grass and use the thinking part of their brain. However I also agree, this game ain't perfect, nothing is. I agree with many that say its honestly hard to believe that Ajay wouldn't side with Pagan. [spoiler] A though this is entirely possible according to the secret ending and if the excerpts from other games are to believed, it is relatively clear that either Ajay took over by eliminating Amita and Sabal in the end or joined Pagan in the first place, also makes the most sense considering to spread his mothers ashes, you know, the whole point of the game, he had to do one or the other at some point. The bad ending is honestly the ending where you either let Amita or Sabal rule, one a child slaver who wants to continue and build on Pagans drug empire and honestly inst all that different or Sabal, the radical follower of Mohan Ghale who believes a religious state who kills all who opposes is what Kyra wants. [/spoiler]
Anyways with all those spoilers and ranting spilled, I honestly would play through this game yet again, despite this already being my third or fourth time playing it and this being the time I am finally going to go for a 100% run. Normally with most games I would go for all the achievements, this game I will not simply cause they are through Uplay and nobody here pays attention to that, not even me. Add Steam achievements so i can brag to all my nonexistent steam friends please. 
In conclusion this game is great and definitely holds up, even today. Lots of political and social remarks, secrets to find, respect shown to the religions of the East, stuff to find, implications that you have to find out, clever foreshadowing dependent on choices, and much else.

More ways to encourage you to explore using creative thinking. Different ways to get around the map make it refreshing to want to just look at something, and then figure out how to get to it. There's a new vehicle too, It's a one person helicopter that makes travelling the map A BREEZE. Different weapons (and some fan favorites returning as well, which is great to see) and throwables help with finding out different ways to suit a playstyle you find more comfortable instead of awkward. The story alone is interesting with different outcomes YOU get to be a part of, the game itself is very fun. I especially enjoy an NPC named Longinus, and his missions he offers.

I give it 4/5, only because I have noticed some annoying bugs that have been in the game since the third entry, and the enemy AI seems to still be very similar to the past few titles. The friendly AI has improved but they still have a lot of issues with pathfinding. It isn't enough to distract me from a great Far Cry game.",1419683233,1671569580,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If u r on 1680x1050 16:10 u have black bars on top and bottom, that u cant get rid off unless u use a fix from a dubios russian url - no thank you.
Major problem is crashes though. Also a problem since 8 years, research reveals theres all kinds of things that might fix it for u, because seems hardware doesnt matter, it can can crash for anyone. So have fun reading pages over pages and MAYBE find a solution. The thing is the crashes are really random - in prologue mission i had 3 in a row within short time, read a bit about the topic, gave farcry4.exe admin rights - didnt have crashes for many hours, next day without changing anything, many crashes in a row again, than again hours without crashes. Im 99% certain its not my PC, no problems like that with other games that would lead me to thinking its a problem on my end. 
Altough i have a 10 year old potatoe, the game runs really well and looks amazing as well.
One can notice right away within the first 10 minutes of the game the many improvements compared to Far Cry 3.
Looks way better, runs way better (fps wise) and many needed improvements in gameplay, hud, ui, inventory and skilltree.
Was able to fix the crashes by putting environment details to low - weird issue that one.
U  might try ur luck, and if the crashes are to annoying, refund within 2 hours. Than get Far Cry 3 and install an overhaul mod - done.

Gameplay wise there a few things that are really annoying. Constant aggressive animals that attack u all the time out of nowhere. U just healed up in base, got a new armor, u want to enter the vehicle over there, WAAAA snake attack - half of ur health gone, 10s later eagle attack - another heal wasted, u shoot that thing out of the sky which alerts half the entire enemy army around u, which are ofc always near in those situations, u defend urself, which alerts even more enemies, and thus lead into a full out war, which at the start of the game most probably gets u killed and later on is just annoying as hell. U can reduce those encounters with a mod, but who knows if that mod is also a crash source?
This enemy aggressiveness and spawn mechanic gets even worse when u try to be stealthy.
On top the animals are quite the bulletsponges...
No one can tell me, that anyone ever playtested this over a longer period and said ""Yes thats fun""

On sale this is definately worth the money, eps with all the options one has available, to make the game more ""realistic, by removing certain hud elemtents and markers and whatnot - good adjustabilty there.",1668522072,1669583031,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

it is a polished up and streamlined far cry 3 with better combat and level design with some fun story missions but getting to where this game shines takes a while as it starts with no narrative stakes and the early missions are so boring

stick with it, after the temple mission the heat gets turned up and mechanically this game flourishes and turns into a high stakes action movie (get the wingsuit in the shop oh my god) and act 3 was so good i couldnt put it down until i finished it.

the story is just ""we have got to overthrow the king"" but its kyrats culture and atmosphere that really bring it together and is a great world to be apart of even if the south looks kind of bland.

a great shooter that takes a while to get off the ground, has some annoying missions but alot of great ones too.

Let's start with the beauty: visually, the game is absolutely stunning. Quite an improvement over Far Cry 3, and still holds up very well even eight years later. The fictional country of Kyrat looks gorgeous no matter where you go. Screenshot-worthy sights are around literally every corner, frequently making your jaw drop. Sometimes you just want to relax for a minute and take it all in, except you can't, because there's probably something waiting to kill you. 

The fauna is extremely aggressive in this game, more so than the previous one I'd say, and it's just as plentiful. While you're taking in those picture postcard views, there's probably a gang of vicious dholes sneaking up on you already, and they have absolutely no instinct for self-preservation and will keep hunting you down and attacking until you reluctantly kill them all, despite their cuddly cuteness. And even if you're careful when sneaking around the pastures and keep your eyes on the ground at all times, you may suddenly get attacked by an eagle mistaking you for its prey. 

In Far Cry 3, you could at least count yourself safe from animal attacks while you were driving a vehicle, but not so in this game, because there's rhinos and elephants who are more than able (and frequently willing) to have a go at you, and if they do, you may end up in a ditch faster than your average drug fiend. 

Of course, it's not just the animals trying to kill you. As usual, the map is also absolutely littered with dumb but trigger happy enemy soldiers, who are always wiling to have a shootout with you. In addition to that, there are now hunters as well, who will attack you with arrows, and due to their sneakiness can be hard to spot. And as if the wildlife wasn't already aggressive enough, they'll lure in predatory beasts to attack you (which, by the way, is an ability you also have). Finally, if they fail to kill you by those means, they can even use fire arrows to set the vegetation around you on fire, which can in some cases cut off your only escape route. 

Fortunately or unfortunately however, the AI is exceedingly dumb, leading it to frequently make extremely clumsy mistakes. Hunters sometimes set themselves on fire by shooting their burning arrows too close, and I've observed soldiers dropping smoke grenades right in front of themselves and then complaining loudly about their inability to see anything. Also, the NPCs are just as likely to be a target for the aggressive wildlife as you are, and because most of them are quite easily killed by one or two gunshots, they frequently fall victim to it en masse. 

Apart from all that, the game pretty much follows the same formula as the previous entries in the series — liberate radio towers to uncover more of the map, capture enemy camps to make the area safer by removing enemy spawn points (and creating fast travel points for yourself), raid loot boxes to get money to buy more guns, hunt animals for their skins to craft more gear, and collect plants in order to craft syringes. And of course, if inbetween all this you still have time for that, there's a story as well, which now occasionally confronts you with different choices, although I have yet to see how those play out eventually. 

All in all Far Cry 4 offers cheap and constant thrills in a very appealing package, but it can get dull rather quickly due to  repetitiveness. Apart from the story missions, there isn't really much to surprise you. You just keep doing the same thing over and over, but with more and better weapons and upgraded skills. It's basically like comfort food: predictable but tasty and generally satisifying.",1668844088,1668844088,True,1,0,0.514563083648681641,0,True,False,False

It has it's good points. Some of the side quests and mini missions are fun so it has some okay-ish pick up and put down aspects but that's it as far as the good stuff goes because the rest is an absolute dumpster fire. 

The AI is buggy as hell. If you drive past an NPC too fast they will try to dodge you..... by jumping straight in front of your vehicle..... and then you loose karma. Enemies at times appear to be psychic somehow seeing you through solid objects and at great distance. There also seems to be a 50/50 chance whether or not the suppressor upgrade for your firearms will actually work. 

The lack of ability to make individual saves and load previous saves is beyond infuriating. When attempting to do perfect undetected liberation's of outposts you have to die in order to to go back and make another attempt, although in hindsight that was pretty stupid because the game doesn't reward you any differently when it comes to how you go about it. Whatever you do the outcome is the same. 

The in game economy is pretty pointless. I made it no less than a quarter to a third of the way through the main missions by the time I had most to weapons and attachments unlocked and purchased because there is no limit to what you can sell and how much you can get from ""vendors"". They may as well have just not bothered with any currency mechanic.

The karma system is completely pointless considering it only has 8 levels which can be gained pretty quickly, yet even so I had all the maps purchased by the time it gave me the first discount which is one of the rewards you get for advancing your karma level. 

The general mechanics of the game are also tremendously bad. Regardless of the enemies strength, rank etc you can't charge them with a melle attack as you will be knocked down 100% of the time and loose 75% of your health in the process. Most of the weapons are barely useful, and even then they are only so for a very limited time. The compound bow for example does a great job at one shotting people in early game but it won't be long before you have to be right behind an enemy giving him a headshot if you want to one shot him. Which is a total shame because doing stealth liberation's with the bow and throwing knives was quite exhilarating and fun. They could have offered various upgrades like higher Ibs rated bow strings or other components. Instead you get two different ""optics"" only one of which is actually useful.

The upgrading aspect of weapons is also just completely stupid. alot of the weapons have hardly any worthwhile upgrades/ attachments and those that have a plethora have an arbitrary limit as to how many can be used. The signature tier of weapons makes the main weapons tier completely pointless as well.

Cut scenes and voice acting are so terrible and are just pure cringe. Very little thought went into the character development. It's pretty obvious from the outset that you(the protagonist) are basically the pawn of two aspiring dictators and the only likable character is Pagan Min, the currently reigning unapologetic dictator. He is also the only decently fleshed out and voice acted character in the entire game. As for the general theme and style of the world itself, it too is as cringe as the acting if not more so. It feels like a weird mishmash of south pacific and east Asian cultures.

Your options in the story line are quite limited and to say this game has ""multiple"" endings is very generous. There are only two endings. You either dethrone the current dictator and help another ascend, or you kill everyone and take it all for yourself....

Over all this game had a lot of potential but it shows the dev's just said ""ah fuck it I couldn't be arsed, send it"". This game could have been so much more. It just feel's like a mishmash of poorly executed ideas that were hobbled together and saddled with a bare basic story.

This will be the last Ubisoft game I dare touch. They are now on my no go list along with EA and Blizzard. It's a shame seeing the companies I grew up with as a kid just going to complete shit and essentially running off with the bag not giving a toss about their fan bases anymore.",1668706204,1668706204,False,3,1,0.513242900371551514,0,True,False,False

I felt a lot of frustration from the game play, with vehicles and animals disappearing before my eyes, combat that was not improved from the last title in the series, and times where it took me five minutes to skin an animal because I was interrupted by hawks, patrols, and other animals simultaneously attacking, leaving a trail of forty dead birds, wolves, bad guys, hawks, and yaks. The story however, is brilliantly different from FC3. I hated the choice in the end of FC3 because it made no sense whatsoever. Your character spends the entire game trying to save his friends, only to be given a choice to kill them at the end of the game. While FC3 had bad guys with very clear evil intent, FC4 has nothing BUT hard choices to make. The king of Kyrat (the main protagonist in FC4), IS a tyrant, but is still accommodating and will keep his word to help you spread your mothers ash's at the end of the game (if you choose not to kill him). You must also choose which character to help in rebelling against the king of Kyrat, while doing the main missions in order to get to the end. Both characters are freedom fighters, but have different ideologies as to how to free the country. I am AMAZED that this game has nothing BUT hard choices, and ALL of them seem to have downsides. All of the choices I made playing this game left me with a raw, empty feeling, like I wasn't sure if I'd made the right decision, but that's war, hell on the mind.  Just like FC3, the land is beautiful, and is fun to explore, there is plenty of things to do and people to kill. The setting is different, but the combat is still the same (fun).

Taking down the whole garrison of an enemy camp or a fort single-handedly by stealth, without being discovered, with a silenced sniper rifle is the biggest buzz in the game for me. The single seater autogyro is a great piece of kit, especially for getting to the top of the bell towers if you carefully manoeuvre it onto one of the upper platforms. Combined with the one-handed grenade launcher it's a formidable weapon. However the thing that really tanks the game are the drug-fogged missions, most forced on the player when held captive and all based in some fantastical environment that really, really doesn't belong in the game. Instead of fighting baddies with all the combat gear upgrades and skill improvements you've earned you're fighting with a knife or bow and arrows against a swarm of demons that can suddenly evaporate into a mist. To be fair they're armed with knives or bows and arrows too but they NEVER seem to miss because your agility has been seriously compromised! And then because you've been stripped of all your gear you have no recourse to your med kit either so you're laboriously pulling out arrows, patting down the flames on your arms or wrapping yourself in dressings - all actions that seem to take an eternity while said demons advance on you. SO YOU KEEP DYING. Re-spawning and having to go through things all over again from an earlier checkpoint are a real buzz kill. The abandoned gold mine mission in Northern Kyrat has got me so frustrated I'm on the cusp of uninstalling the game because it's just so damned tedious, tedious, tedious. The game doesn't even offer an option to abandon this supernatural nightmare when I just want to get out and fight with the rebels in the real world.

In some ways its similar to FC3, but it has many improvements, and feels a lot less clunky compare to FC3. The game still looks actually pretty dam good, story is solid, gunplays is good and guns....sound...awesome!

ISSUES:
It has helicopter now, its tiny and very unsafe, with clear intention to kill you. Jokes aside i probably died more times killed by heli than actual enemies. Unless you park it level, chances are, it will chop you to peaces every time you want to exit...ah ubisoft...never changes. 
You still have to climb towers. Luckily you can skip that by parking helicopter on top of the tower, probably not intended by devs, but its a huge time save, that means no reason not to. 
Flying is very clunky and tends to break quite often.
There are many bugs, sometimes mission don't simply work, textures failed to load and many others. 
If you have upgrades to your ammo counts, every time you exit shangri-la you lose your bonus ammo, and have to buy back at a HUGE expence. What seems to be happening there, game dosent take into account your weapon ammo upgrades when transferring you there and assigns default values. There for, removing any ammo that is over default value.

PERFORMANCE. Actually quite good, didint encounter any issues there,

STORY. Very good. Straight from the start its very engaging. It has good lenght and its interesting. Story is messing a lot with morality. There is not a truly good side, all of them are in various shades of grey, and none compromise anything. Game is constantly challenging, asking, are you doing the right thing? Are you supporting the right side? Can you justify your actions? Game made me ask those questions, and realise that for sake of ""fun"" most of those questions will result in ""no"". And at the end, game points out that none of that was necessary. Just enjoy you Crab Rangoon. Just awesome stuff.
  Really really liked ""Shangri - la"". There narator is describing the land, and telling you the lore of the land and what befell on it. And surprisingly, its very interesting, and good, could not wait to listen more.
Other sides quest are ok tho.

The little chopper is a nice addition for bum-rushing all the quick-travel towers.
The grappling hook is a nice addition for climbing up to wingsuit jump spots.
Also you get the wingsuit before Act 2, and it is MUCH more forgiving.  In FC3, if you wingsuit off a slightly-too-small hill, you'll be instakilled.  In FC4, you just take a bar or two of health damage.

Hitler's Buzzsaw (MG3) is game-breaking overpowered, but you can't unlock it until Act 2.
The mandatory Vedic archery sequences are annoying, but at least they aren't the whole game (cf. Far Cry Primal).

I have played every Far Cry game and each was somewhat solid, in terms of the story. Playing FC3 was really immersive, you've started as a tourist, fought for your live, developed some skills, got better with guns and finally made it to the end.

There is a downside as well. Since FC2, the end of game phase looks kinda alike. Get to the outpost, clear it out, proceed. Rinse and repeat. But that's acceptable if you are already deep into the story and you can really have fun clearing the enemies with all the combos, explosive arrows or totally Rambo style, opening fire at everything that moves with a machine gun. 

However with the FC4, the game fails to entertain right from the start. Spoiled alert - do not proceed further.

This time we are just a guy trying to fullfill the last wish of the mother. We are being kidnapped by some local king which when compared to Vas, is totally unconvinceable. Anyway, after following the corridor (literally!) we find ourselves in Call of Duty style escape, shooting with the SMG into incoming enemies. Like, yeah, from ""I am scared tourist"" to ""Captain Price"" in a mere seconds. And then we have get to the desired point. Which we do by throwing grenades and silent killing dozens of enemies with a knife. Yeah, totally normal for an tourist who just got there. Any backstore? Anything which would turn this plausible? NOPE. Like a wet dream of a teenager, we were thrown into guerilla warfare and we totally outperform Rambo. 

But that's just a tutorial! And it gets worse! We are instantly offered typical missions like ""Kill X"", ""liberate the outpost"" and ""take down the radio transmitter"". Even driving, well, drives you mad because the tunes are like 2 minutes long and repeating constantly. Even the fact that the world is absolutely full of everything - money, ammo, even vehicles! In FC3 finding a car was a great help. Here, ATVs, jeeps, even helicopters, are just scattered in the area. Pick whatever you want. Go, kill, rinse, repeat. And you might think, yeah, the story might save this game. Aaaand we are let down again. The choices have no real impact. The cutscenes are not interruptible. I have played 4 hours and I am this close to uninstalling.

First time that I logged to game I thought that intro was waaaay too long, well another time that I started game over, I realized that you cannot skip intro even on second start and that 5 mins discussing chit-chat /shooting session is really annoying and stupid. Also during questing there are long videos that you cannot skip, it really is disturbing.

Game looks great in ultra resolution. With ultra resolution enemies can hide behind bushes making them almost impossible to detect without binocular/camera (tagging makes enemies visible even behind the walls, like in other parts of series). 

When you shoot enemy ""out of range"", you cannot hit him/her, but same enemy can hit you with same gun that you are using, bit strange? If you are shooting without silencer, all enemies will detect you at once. And as said, enemies can use AK-47 from distance 200 meters even you cannot hit anything with AK-47 from 150 m away.

The most disturbing thing is that in a middle of the fight EAGLES are attacking you. Wtf, Eagles do not attack people, ever IRL, what is this?

I have used withing another parts of this series that you can study enemy movements (with binoculars) before starting your attack and you can survive normally within the first try even on hard settings. Well, not in this game, at least not before you collect descent sniper rifle with silencer. Enemy aiming is superior compared to you. Enemy have unlimited ammo, so more or less, it takes multiple tries before you can complete even quite simple task and that is a bit frustrating. When you are clearing outposts and you get killed in action, you need to start again from quite far away. You have to kill same bears and wolves all over again meaning that when you finally are back in action zone, you have already spent half of your ammo...

VOICES is game are sooo annoying. Females are crying all the time, your allies are shooting in air so you cannot hear if there is fight going on or are they just wasting ammo. Civilians are chit-chatting all the time, disturbing is that player cannot turn any of these stupid sounds off...

Even your character itself makes disturbing sounds i.e. when skinning animals, luckily that animation can be set off so noise is gone too.

All these negative things listed here makes it impossible for me to recommend the game.",1488617409,1666560648,False,1,2,0.359513401985168457,0,True,False,False

I've completed it 4 or 5 times and I still love it as much as I did on my first playthrough. This is quite possibly the best setting in any game I've played. The rich culture and beautiful scenery of Kyrat helps make this an immersive experience that keeps the player interested at all times. Yes the graphics are starting to show their age now, but I still maintain the idea that this game is beautiful. Ajay is an interesting protagonist and he's a lot more likable than Jason in my opinion. The voice acting is very solid and helps bring each of the characters to life. The gameplay is typical Far Cry, which is brilliant. My only gripe with the gameplay is the return of radio towers; I'm glad this is the last game they make an appearance in. The story is very interesting, I like how you are presented with the choice of backing Amita or Sabal and how your choices lead to different mission objectives. There are far more guns than there were in Far Cry 3, including more signature weapons, which have special attributes and mods. Overall, I'd give this game a 9/10. It's a must play for Ubisoft fans and anyone who loves first person shooters.

Valley of the Yetis DLC:
Definitely worth a playthrough if you enjoyed the main game. The story is pretty much nonexistent, but it's engaging enough to make the whole playthrough interesting. Gameplay is identical to the main game, no new weapons or combat skills were added unfortunately. The relay defense missions are fun, as is the relay station upgrade system. The yetis are rather underwhelming unfortunately. Even on the hardest difficulty, I never died to one. Still a fun, worthwhile experience in my opinion. I'd give it a 7/10.",1665810476,1665810476,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

You can lure a rhino into a forest, and then YEET it into the sky with a C4 you have planted on a tree.

I would like to mention that yeah I'm aware of this game's age. its nearly 9 years old at the time of making this review but honestly I still wanted to share the experience and see how the game is doing.
This wasn't my first playthrough at all, I played the game on the Xbox 360 for the first time but of course. I wanted to experience this game at its max on a high end PC. (9900K+RTX 3080).

Far Cry 4 is a good step forward over the third game in the series by a large margin. not only you get large graphical improvements but overall, the game itself is deeper in terms of the story, adds more variety with your options as a player and in general is annoying more challenging but also felt unique.

Graphics - yeah, the game is old as it came out in 2014 but if I gotta be honest. it doesn't fall off from newer titles by much and looks like way ahead of its time and at maximum settings with high FPS. It was an amazing experience but even on the Xbox 360 which was nearly 10 years when this game came out. it looked reasonably well despite the limitations of the given hardware. overall, the game aged well with lighting and general texture quality + effects.

Story - FC3 was a parody in that regard, it was about Vaas and purely about him. but FC4 did expend upon the idea and gave us more possible views to understand the game by introducing multiple high priority characters and also introducing the element of choice which would affect the outcome of the game. choosing between Sabal and Amita will give you different missions in game. similar but with a different taste

Gameplay - Taking Radio stations feels at times much more difficult as now you have an actual challenge that you need to deal with which is ""how I get to the top floor"". on FC3 it was simply a ladder while FC4 is far more like a puzzle inspired by platformers.
Then we get to the option of riding an elephant and the introduction of the Bazzer which makes matter so much more comfortable when it comes to long distance rides.

In conclusion? 9/10.
FC4 was indeed an awesome experience that I would people to check it out but unfortunately it wasn't all perfect. FPS drops from time to time (130-140 to 65), Wingsuit being utterly annoying to use and the game doesn't tell at times how to interact with certain items if you are low on HP. but overall. it was an awesome experience and I was glad to revisit the game once more.

The main character isn't an empty shell and is easy to get behind.  I actually prefer the weapons in this game over the ones in 5 and New Dawn.  There's a lot of discussion about how the antagonist is one of the most likable of the franchise.  Indeed, he is charismatic, but I wouldn't say I ""like"" him.  He's a whackjob dictator who oppresses his people.  Players have a few choices when it comes to the game's outcome, but nothing too impactful.  The plot and story are average, but not bad.  You basically have only two choices at any given moment and none of them are really winners.  You can side with an old-fashioned dude who's traditions consist of women being married in their teens and not treated as equals, or a friggin' harpy who wants to turn the country into a drug state in the name of her warped vision of progress.  Like I said, no real winners there.

I'd have to say my biggest beef was with that Rabi Ray Rana (that Radio Free Kyrat clown).  I know he's a radio personality, but even by those standards he can't seem hear enough of his own voice.  Not to mention the crap he talks about is just stupid.  I'd rather hear the music, or even the propaganda, thanks.

Few bugs here and there, but nothing really game-breaking unless you somehow get stuck outside the map like I did once.  The most frustrating thing is when you're wingsuiting and you brush the side of a tree for an insta-kill.

Jason Brody was a party guy with his friends, and his character developed into a psychotic warrior who could kill at a moment's notice. He was a survivor. On his first kill, he actually seems somewhat hesitant and guilty. The story was very consistent. The main character grew, rescued his friends and brother, but became a monster. The two endings allow you to embrace your inner animal and die like one, or remember why you started and save your friends. The story asks ""What have you become?"" Are you a survivor or an animal?

In FC4, the mc just casually starts killing people. It's really weird. A normal person from the states wouldn't be like that. If you look him up on the wiki he served in the us special forces, but that's not well explained in game. There's no logical reason to leave when the villain tells you to sit and eat. No one wanted to get ""rescued"" by the golden path. Why is he volunteering to go on these suicidal missions? The golden path ends up being even worse than the previous dictator. You either turn the country into a drug den or let it languish into poverty. I'd call this storytelling noire. He also doesn't really grow as a character either. The story asks ""Why are you doing this?"" And I don't have an answer. Pang is ""a bad guy?"" OK, what does that make you? Turning the country into an impoverished starvation bin? Turning it into a drug den so it can profit off of other people's suffering?

Compared to Farcry 3, the gameplay is better. The environment is beautiful, the challenges are more tactical. Scouting is easier and your arsenal is larger. I found the bow much less useful then the previous game, but the rest of the kit was exceptional. The son of Mohan is much stronger than jason brody. But his enemies are stronger too.

Overall I would only recommend this game if you don't care about the story and just want more FC3 gameplay. Other than that this game feels like an attack on the player. It effectively insults you for enjoying killing in your spare time.",1664087172,1664132972,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I still stand by the precedent of how it's a drop in quality from the previous games, basically just a copy of Far Cry 3 though it looks absolutely beautiful and I completely understand how they wanted to recreate Vaas by having Pagan Min which I enjoyed Troy Baker's performance, it just wasn't the same. He didn't have that same magic. The only thing I can really give this game is the fact that there's alot more like replayability to it. Even if you beat the campaign with one of the multiple endings, there's still alot more you can do which I appreciate. Far Cry 3 didn't give you that option sadly. But yeah, it was pretty bland. Pretty boring. I didn't really feel anything for anybody. At least when I killed Vaas, I was sad because I loved every encounter with him. With Pagan, I just did it no mercy style and they didn't even attempt ya know like tryna give Ajay an arc.

TLDR; My husband says ‘Goblin Mode activated’ when we start to have sex, growls and acts like a caveman, and then says ‘Goblin Mode off’ when we stop, and then pretends not to remember afterward.

I really love my husband and he’s always been great in bed. But recently he’s been acting really weird. So, a couple of days ago, my son went on a rampage through our house and said he was in ‘Goblin Mode’. We didn’t really know what to do with him, so we sent him to live with my parents so he can go to a special needs school. My husband a really great relationship with our son and loved him more than anything. Naturally, he was upset when he had to leave. He’s an incredibly tough man, but this was the first time I’ve ever seen him cry. I think since then, he’s been a little emotionally unwell. I’ve heard him muttering, ‘Goblin’ repeatedly when he didn’t notice me, staring blankly into his food, and just going alone by himself to do who knows what. I feel awful for him, but we both agreed that this was for the best. Last night, the day after our son went away, we decided to have sex to relieve our stress. However, my husband said ‘Goblin Mode activated’, starting growling, and went wild having sex with me. Admittedly, it was some of the best and most experimental sex I’ve ever had, but I’m worried that something might be going on with my husband.

Being an Indian, I can tell you, it very authentic. Game is set in North India where people look like they are from east India and they speak in south Indian accent. Excellent <sarcasm>.

The latter includes lentils, pulses and vegetables spiced commonly with ginger and garlic, but also more discerningly with a combination of spices that may include coriander, cumin, turmeric, cinnamon, cardamon, jimbu and others as informed by culinary conventions. In an actual meal, this mental representation takes the form of a platter, or thali, with a central place for the cooked cereal, peripheral ones, often in small bowls, for the flavourful accompaniments, and the simultaneous, rather than piecemeal, ingestion of the two in each act of eating, whether by actual mixing—for example of rice and lentils—or in the folding of one—such as bread—around the other, such as cooked vegetables. Dal-bhat, centred around steamed rice is the most common example. as well as dairy and sometimes meat, is the most common and prominent example. The unleavened flat bread made from wheat flour called chapati occasionally replaces the steamed rice, particularly in the Terai, while Dhindo, prepared by boiling corn, millet or buckwheat flour in water, continuously stirring and adding flour until thick, almost solid consistency is reached, is the main substitute in the hills and mountains.

Ubisoft's last far cry with decent storytelling and game mechanics. Unfortunately, 8 years and several games later, that suffer from the same issues, Ubi developers put out unfinished products every single year. It's the game I probably put the most time in, and I've only recently ported to PC, and I can't bear myself to play anymore, the game has by far the best stealth system, in theory only, in practice, the developers make it feel like it was rushed in a couple of weeks with 0 playtesting. I won't focus much on loud gameplay since it's very basic and there's not much to talk about. The worst offenders are the character controller and the dogshit AI. To keep it short, the movement feels very stiff, you bounce off anything Ubisoft didn't intend you to be able to climb onto, which is the case for the vast majority of ledges, not to mention the awful delay to having the climb button pop up, EXTRA: (which is present even in takedowns, I've failed plenty of stealth attempts because I would press F too quickly and the game wouldn't register it as a takedown and as a melee hit, which no matter where it lands, it alerts the guard in front of you alongside the entire map. The AI is awful, in most cases the moment they spot you or hear noise(bullet passing by their head/hitting some surface close to them, the gun itself[silenced weapons still make noise], running or walking) they alert the entire map even if they are killed the next second, thus the only way you can kill enemies is by landing one-shots and takedowns as even an extra bullet hitting their corpse will alert the enemies near.
Animals are superior to humans in almost every way, they soak bullets like an armored enemy unit to the point where it takes two sniper shots to take out a small dog, which has the power to instantly alert the entire map once it starts barking. )

In conclusion, Ubisoft will go out of their way to ensure you play their way and to have the least fun possible. Every action you do has an animation for it(climbing on a small elevated surface? the game climbs on top or over instead of letting you jump on top), the game wants you to play stealth as slow as possible, because of the awful movement system, running around taking out enemies fast is very difficult and takes a lot of skill since you're trying to get around all this crap, and it's the only reason I'm still playing the game. 

You'd think they'd fix all this in the future games, and while stealth is easier because of the brain dead AI, the exact same issues are still present, reason why I cannot stand the stealth in FC5, it's a buggy unfinished mess. FC6 does fix a couple of them, but manages to introduce others. I'm not even going to consider trying out the next Far Cry, since I know for certain it will suffer from the same problems as it predecesors.

Right off the bat, the game is super familiar to it's precursors, and its graphics have improved drastically; it is an insanely beautiful game. Though not too much changes apart from the more high-definition textures and higher quality cutscenes. Even the UI is practically an exact replica, just designed the slightest bit better. Again, it's no surprise considering this game came out two years after its previous mainline title. But I would describe Far Cry 4 as a different experience entirely, despite carrying over a lot of the features from its predecessors.

Because this world is set in the Himalayas, Far Cry 4 gives you a plethora of locations to use your wingsuit, alongside the new addition of the grappling hook. The map is designed very well, and doesn't at all feel bloated. Loot and collectibles populate the map just enough that exploration isn't quite the hassle that it would be in other open-world games. Something I appreciate about this game is that it really likes to emphasize on its inclusion of animals. Stealth has become much more fun with the addition of bait, and the ability to ride elephants into battle adds a new spin to combat.

Although not much of the gunplay has changed since its predecessors, some of these guns are still quite powerful. If you struggle to get past story missions, it might be worth it to invest in the Buzzsaw and the Auto-Cross early game. The Buzzsaw just straight mows down tank enemies like it's no problem, and the Auto-Cross is basically just a throwing knife but a bow. These guns really made every mission after obtaining them feel like a breeze to get past. Fortunately, you get both of these as a reward for liberating the 17 Bell Towers, which makes exploration a must. My personal loadout includes the Buzzsaw, Auto-Cross, Bushman and the M-79 just for good measure.

Before Far Cry 3, the franchise never really had a status of creating the 'larger-than-life' villains that they do today. I think that Pagan Min really helped solidify that for Far Cry; him and Vaas are usually the two characters that come to mind when someone says 'Far Cry villain'. I think that because of him, this game exudes a type of charisma you genuinely wouldn't find in other Far Cry titles.

Having to live up to the expectations of Far Cry 3 must have been quite difficult to do. Since 3's whole schtick was that the kill count you rack up throughout your playthrough completely demoralizes you by the end of the story, that concept was something really unique and one that couldn't be replicated by it's successors. I think that Far Cry 4's story still does a good job at presenting the player a moral dilemma in the first place. If you're going into it blindfolded, it can definitely be quite charming and clever. I personally enjoyed it, anyway. The story ends in four different ways, with two epilogues based on which person you chose to lead the Golden Path. It's worth it for you to try and figure out some of these endings on your own. Just make sure to regularly back up your saves. This is especially important after the Payback mission.

This game really makes you FEEL like you have a father figure that genuinely cares about you.

I enjoy the Far Cry series, I've played most of them. I enjoy the loop of expanding the map, liberating outposts, unlocking more guns, yadda yadda. 

This entry is just awful. It literally SEEKS to make every step of the way more unfun. 

- The game takes place in the freakin' HIMALAYAS but anything sharper than a 35 degree incline will make you slide down. 

- Where in the world are eagles legitimate threats to humans? Anywhere? Well in this game they are ever-present and will take your health down to zero even after health upgrades. EVEN THE NPCS are constantly screaming about them. I'm not even kidding. 

- You want to walk a mere 100km to get to a mission start? Sorry, there's a pack of wild dogs. Now your ammo is gone. Gotta go back and refill. Oh wait sorry also now you have to go back and defend an outpost you already liberated. Oh wait now there's two or four ""Karma"" objectives in your way too. 

- Within the first hour of the game my ""wallet"" was full??? I had to go out of my way to kill a specific animal just to increase my wallet size to over 250k??? Who thought this was a good idea. 

- Same as above within first hour but for the worthless ""loot"" bag. Loot is just random nouns you extract from chests that serve as nothing more to turn into money at stores. But oh wait you can't do that right now because your wallet is full. (Can I open up a savings account or something???) I CANT CARRY ANYTHING ANYMORE. 

- The acting, per usual, is pretty quality, but holy shit I don't have patience for this dude to do his best King Lear monologue after all the aforementioned has exhausted my patience with this game. 

- Speaking of the acting, you will be pulled between two main protagonist characters and whomever you choose you will literally have to sit through extended cutscenes where the other is just berating you for choosing that way. Again, who thought this would make the game enjoyable?

- There's an early mission where you are transported to the high Himalayas, wind and snow whipping everywhere, an Oxygen meter (aka a timer), and it ends up being a glorified fetch mission where you go to four corners of the map to loot bodies to find nothing. And while I was doing this mission, there was a point where whilst getting shot at, I was also attacked by TWO mountain lions and an eagle at the same time. Did anyone stop to think if any of this crap would be fun?

- The healing system is stupid.

- There's a gladiator arena in the Himalayas??? Ridiculousness aside, again, this is an unfun mission that they also will let you go back to play again and again (no thanks). 

- There's a set of missions where you're always ""tripping out"" and while I guess creative they are just frustrating and confusing. 

- Hipfire headshots are easier to hit than looking down the sights. 

If you really want to play Far Cry, go play 2, 3, or 5.",1661796671,1662060014,False,1,0,0.464196860790252686,0,True,False,False

THATS IT, no other reason but then you get dragged into a civil war and you have no idea what's going on but you just fight back against the main villain for no reason.

You play as Ajay Ghale, the son of Kyrati freedom fighter Mohan Ghale, who is returning to his mother's home nation of Kyrat to spread her ashes after moving to the United States when you were a child. You're caught in the middle of a political struggle between eccentric zealot Pagan Min (who claims he had a relationship with your late mother) and the Golden Path, a rebel group attempting to wrest control of the current regime. After being rescued and recruited by the Path, you have to choose between the differing approaches of their two leaders: Sabal, a traditionalist, wants to protect people and honor the ways of the Path, while Amita, the radicalist, wants to try new, controversial angles and stop playing by the Path's rules. This is the core story, and while the idea of choice in the narrative and mission structure is interesting, the fact that neither Sabal nor Amita ever seem to be best option kinda removes that illusion a little bit. I honestly wish there was a third option to balance out the choices just a little bit more. The story is also pretty paper thin, there's not much more nuance outside of the core premise. 

The gameplay is very similar to Far Cry 3, with the game being mostly open world (parts of the world open up as you progress through the story) and the ability to choose multiple approaches to any confrontation is still a really fun aspect of these games. I, however, think this game's mechanics are more fun that 3's, with the addition of new weapon, riding elephants, driving flying vehicles, and more helping to give you even more routes to success. Capturing radio towers to clear up the map and raiding outposts are still the main non-story world activities, but there are additional missions including hunting rare animals, finding and delivering supply drops, and Karma missions that affect your stock with the Golden Path that add more variation to when you're just farting around in the open world.

The graphics in this game are still great to this day. Character designs are vibrant and interesting, the world is gorgeous and feels very similar to traditional Pan-Asian and Indian culture, and the HUD is clean. Voice acting is well performed and the game can occasionally bug out, but more often than not the result is hilarious rather than intrusive. Ultimately, I'd give it an 8/10, a very fun open world shooter with a predictable but serviceable story.",1661099471,1661099471,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Still fun if you like the Far Cry formula, which gives you plenty of things to do in a massive and still graphically impressive open-world setting. The trick with all the Far Cry games, I think, is not to get sucked into completing everything. Different players will enjoy different kinds of missions, so I'd recommend resisting the obsessive urge to complete and collect to 100% and just do what's fun. Even then, Far Cry 4 offers a good 50-60hrs of gameplay. OCD completionists might clock in twice as many hours.

Personally, I find unlocking towers and taking out outposts undetected the most enjoyable aspect of the game - combined with the open-world exploration and the relaxing 'puzzle game' aspect of negotiating the landscape to find treasures, masks, letters and whatnot. It's only when this open-world gameplay narrows down in certain scripted missions that the fun factor can diminish and frustration levels rise. I generally avoided anything involving escorting supply trucks, beating the clock, or bossfights - but that's just me. It's all very subjective and I guess it's to the credit of the Far Cry DEVs that so much is put on the table for you to choose from.

On my system (GTX1080, i7 9700k, 16MB DDR4 3200 RAM), the game ran well at 1440p almost maxed out. Following online advice (and some crashes - especially in the Shangri-La missions), I avoided any of the special Nvidia settings and turned off the fur effects. Using 4xMSAA, the game typically ran at 50-80FPS at Ultra.

What about the story? Do we play Far Cry games for the story? I guess it's OK. Pagan Min is an engaging villain (if that's the right word) and your character Ajay isn't the annoying frat-boy that Far Cry 3's tonally deaf protagonist was. Of course, you 'win' the game basically by shooting almost everything and everyone in sight, so I wasn't sure what all those karma points earned really amounted to. That's when I spared a thought for it in the interludes between indulging the glorious power fantasy, blood-frenzy of the OP and aptly named Buzzsaw. I know. Coming back as a cockroach, right?

Particular likes? The more vertical aspect of the Far Cry landscape is fun. The wee Buzzer helicopter is a neat addition that is fun to fly and that helps traversing the game's alpine settings. Of course, you still have the hang-gliders, wingsuit, etc.

I thought the Shangri-La missions were imaginative and striking, and that they presented a great contrast to the regular game-play.

Particular dislikes: the Steam/U-play interface is tiresome to negotiate when starting up the game

The graphics, especially the character rendering is beautiful. What I found amazing was that the animators were able to convey subtleties like body language so easily -- it was truly like watching a movie. I would have liked a little more of the backstory to be spelled out, by the time I had finished the game, I was still a bit confused as to who had done what to whom, and what was motivating the story. As far as the game play is concerned, as other reviewers have said, it is a Far Cry game, if you have played any of the others, you know what to expect. If you haven't: the game gives you the option to use stealth, or brute force. I greatly enjoy playing with stealth. There are a fun variety of vehicles, including mini-helicopters, speed boats, and elephants. Some of the vehicle controls were a little fussy, but on the whole, they were easy to get the hang of. A nice variety of weapons to choose from, again, allowing you to play towards stealth or brute force. My biggest complaints were the game play was HUGE with fewer respawn spots than I would like, meaning you could spend an hour crossing the map, only to get killed in a random accident and respawn back where you started, forcing you to do the whole thing all over again. My other complaint is that I did not think that there were enough Experience Points upgrades. About halfway through the game, I had leveled up my character almost to the maximum and had purchased or won most of the weapons. After that, I didn't feel much motivation to go on side-quests because while I kept earning Experience Points, I didn't have anything to spend them on.

However, the gameplay more than makes up for it. This game has by far the most amount and most diversity in weapons of any Far Cry game that I've played (3, 4, 5, Blood Dragon). Compared to FC3, lots of game mechanics have been improved, making the gameplay much smoother than it was in FC3. I'm not going much into detail here, but I'm talking about little changes here and there. The graphics are a lot better too! The music chosen in this game (most of it from The Bombay Royale) fits the setting and Indian/Nepali culture beautifully. The Himalayas are beautiful, and the wildlife is fantastic too. The eagles are a bit annoying sometimes though.

Pagan Min might not have a lot of screen time, but I like him. He comes across as mannered, organized, yet insane at some level. He often contacts you through your radio and rambles a bit. It's pretty funny sometimes. There's a lot of mystery surrounding Ajay's parents, specifically the relationship between his mother (Ishwari) and Pagan Min, and his father, Mohan.

The story is built on a moral dilemma between old, religious values (which is what Sabal wants) and modern values, centering profit and the economy (which is what Amita wants), For nearly every story mission, Sabal and Amita each have their own approach to completing it, and you choose which way to go. One of them will become the leader of the Golden Path at the end of the game.

He is probably second only to Handsome Jack in terms of ""over the radio"" banter with the player character.

Far Cry 4 is, in my opinion, the best game in the franchise. The story has so much heart and soul, and it's clear that a lot of passion was poured into this game before things splintered before production finished - the characters are well played, well written, and mesh so perfectly together. The gameplay is intuitive and engaging, and not hard to get the hang of. Does it lack some of the more modern amenities of the later Far Cry games? Sure. But I don't think it needs all the new stuff to still be an enjoyable, easily replayable game. And, let's be honest, Pagan Min is an amazing villain, especially for a series that relies so heavily on their bad guys.

About 1-2 hours before finishing this game, I was ready to give it a mediocre review because of the story, the way it didn't seem to make a whole lot of sense. I admit that especially in comparison to FC3, the gameplay is subtly improved in many respects. There's a LOT more to do, in an equally beautiful setting. Of course, Pagan Min is amazing. 

Then I finished it. And it all made quite a bit more sense. This game gets into politics a bit more than other games in the series, but it does so in a way that you don't really notice until after you've finished. 

At the end of the day, FC3 > FC4

Far Cry 3, don't get me wrong is very fun, and has some great features to it, that really innovated and caused them to stick to that formula for 10+ years, while it has changed it would be nice if they really tried to reinvent the game, it's been getting repetitive, swap map, swap outposts, towers, etc in their own way. I still enjoyed the game a lot, it improved, and added new features to what was great to 3, the backdrop of the Himalayas really was cool. Fortresses was an amazing addition, graphics are still very good, underrated compared to 3's love, 4 generally didn't reinvent the series much, but it made the game better, with new features, weapons and more. Was it basically a cheap copy to the extent of innovation in a sense yes, but it improved over many things in 3 with flaws too. 

Is it worth it? 
Yes. 
The next part is slightly a rant about Ubisoft:
$30 is good for it, you can get it on sale for under $10 and the other far cry games generally for dirt cheap, sadly Ubisoft hates us and we hate them so it's mutual, considering their removing content for older games when it costs next to nothing to maintain the servers, hearing a company with billions of dollars unable to upkeep online functionalities for games that came out around 10 years ago is unfortunate. They should also just bring 6 over they are limiting their profits specifically because they dislike steam.

Keeping the core of a game with each new release is not bad, it's something that many franchises do, but we have to learn that keeping the core of the game does not mean recycling the same things from the previous games: Better graphics and different characters is not a ""new game"".

In matters of history I do not recommend this game either, it makes no sense. Although Far Cry 3 did not have the most credible story, the characters were charismatic, they had reasons to do what they were doing, FR 3 left memorable characters that people still remember today. But what about Far Cry 4? More of the same but worst implemented, another crazy villain who has an army of people at his disposal, how original. Ajay is the flattest thing that exists, this character has no motivation, no personality: ""Oh yes, I came to this island to fulfill my family's last wish, I don't know anyone, I'm not a soldier, I have no experience in combat and I've probably never killed anyone, but I'm going to help the people on this island (people I don't know) who are at war, who have hundreds of soldiers with more experience than me, but who are completely incompetent and can't move forward until a nobody, son of a supposed legend shows up. And now I, like I said, not being a soldier and not having any military experience, I'm going to take out entire armies myself because that's what the script says."" I'm not going to talk about Amita and Sabal, it's physically impossible for me not to fall asleep while these characters are talking, flat and filler characters, useless more than anything. Pagan is another character who at first seems to be the only interesting character, but he is completely another excuse and completely boring. It's hard for me to empathize with the characters in this game, they don't seem memorable to me, they seem boring.

The only reason to buy this game (And even then, it doesn't seem like a good enough reason to me), is if you like the Far Cry 3 gameplay loop, since it's the same thing; You free the towers, clear camps full of enemies and shoot everything that moves. Do not buy this game thinking that it will be a new experience. Far Cry 3 is a better game, if for some reason you haven't played it and are thinking of starting with Far Cry 4, go for FR 3 and don't waste your time with this game.",1658278939,1658279066,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

The graphics look very nice when standing still, However as soon as I move in this game there's like a visible zone a couple of meters infront of the character where the graphics change to the better (Pixelated Artifacting). It's ugly as hell seeing shadows and textures change as I move back and forth. Apparently it's part of how the engine works to reduce pop-ins but it looks horrible. 

The fights are decent but there's so much annoying crap. Quick time events, slopes you can't climb normally, constant animal attacks that makes the game feel so retarded. Mixing bears, wolfs, tigers, elephants, eagles all in these areas is so dumb. They really needed to tone down the animals aggression and numbers. It's laughable how many tigers and other predators there are running around attacking humans. I'm surprised they didn't add polar bears as well. 

There's a whole myriad of things that just feels badly balanced and wrong. 
Being able to deploy the wing suit 5 feet above ground from you moving at running speed jumping over some tiny rock. Dying from wing suit by touching a branch.
Dying or getting seriously injured from a 1m drop of a ledge or something. 
Shooting animals or people with a high powered sniper rifle in the chest and they take 2-3 hits before going down. 
The story characters blabbering on radio for minutes about total random bullsh*t I don't wanna hear and being unable to skip it.

The story is a joke. I started the campaign and got a choice of two missions. Because I choose to help get some intel the other guy is now actually accusing me of not saving his men from the other mission. I can't believe they actually wrote this garbage. Even if the rebellion was only made up of the three people involved and the law of physics only allowed one mission to be carried out at the same time, he still has the gall to blame the player character for something he could have done himself. It's not like he's in a wheelchair or anything. The very idea that the player character who just arrived and started to help is now somehow sole responsible for their whole combat operations is laughable and retarded.
Normally games try hard to make a player feel like they are part of a large organization, here instead they tell you outright that you are the only person fighting and handling everything. It's beyond retarded. 

I seriously hate most of the allied NPCs and I straight up want to murder Reggie and Yogi along with rabi ray rana and join pagan min. 

The franchises love of mixing in pointless and stupid drug sequences is baffling and does nothing but trivialise story and boss elements.

I admit, I played the game wrong. Instead of concentrating on the actual missions, I constantly veered off collecting loot and completing random tasks. And they do not enrich the experience. If you aim to 100% this game, please don’t. It will not reward you.

The game is riddled with little bugs and annoyances. Shooting an enemy can be blocked by an invisible object, enemies and NPCs get stuck in rocks and trees. People, vehicles, animals disappear when you turn your back on them, buttons may not register, etc. Game always starts in windowed mode, and resets auto aim to ON at startup.

Largely the same issues FC3 had, but amplified. Nothing game breaking, but frustrating to say the least.

Harder enemies are just bullet sponges. Collecting items and completing tasks is tedious and meaningless. The vast open world offers nothing after the first few hours. This isn’t fun. This is work.

The story of FC3 kinda explained all the extreme sports, crazy characters, random titties, and wild drug trips. But in FC4 these elements seem out of place.

If you are thinking about buying this game (and ""BUY"" is the plain wording on every Steam store page), be aware you may only be able to play it for the next 6 weeks, before Ubisoft REMOVES it from your library.

Ubisoft also thinks it is clever to put the game on promotion for new suckers just before REMOVING the game.  Ie AC Liberation HD was on promotion price last week during the Steam summer sale, this week the store page says the game will no longer playable in 6 weeks time.  

The Steam store pages (links below) for AC Liberation HD, and Silent Hunter 5, both have notices saying ""Please note this title will not be ACCESSIBLE following September 1st, 2022"".  Even though you BOUGHT these single player games, you will not be able to access them.

I saw the screenshots, saw the trailer, I thought to myself, this game looks stunning, and it was, so I contemplated it for a while, then I broke down and bought it.   The game is a lot of fun, I really enjoyed every hour of it, and it's a beautiful, vibrant, colorful game.

  Story: You are Ajay Ghale who's returned to Kyrate to achieve his mothers last dying wish, and that's to spread her ashes at Lakshmana.  But, Ajay finds himself trapped in the middle of a war between, The Golden Path, The Royal Army, and Pagan Min a corrupt dictator.  It's up to Ajay to decide which side of The Golden Path he wishes to help most, and in the end to debate who gets control.   

  The gameplay I find to be rather smooth and tons of fun creating chaos.  Only complaint is the Damned EAGLE!!!!!!!  The Eagles are a pain, but just keep a look out, cause they do massive damage causing you to use a syringe.

The AI is rather stupid, lol!  I don't know what it is, but NPC's for some reason will run right into your Vehical, dying, and the game will tell you to not kill civilians.  My bad, the guy just ran in front of me, instead of getting out of my way!  

Keeping this short, I'd recommend playing if you wanna get into Far Cry, or go Buy Far Cry 3, still a great game.

FarCry 4 fixed the ""I die and loose the ammo used in free roam after I got teleported to next radar tower"" which I hated in F3 but what is worse is the way how you get to missions, seemingly forcing the players to waste time in a meaningless open world which is also I think more interesting if it would not be the same boring copy paste goals.

I jumped off a rock and guards heard me like ALL in the camp. WHY. Dishonored introduced the arrows-to-mission-goals and missing mission info in the game word but instead only as HUD-info / on-screen info.

The jumping off a rock and dying made me uninstall this Ubisoft game. F3 was the die, loose ammo, no save points like manual saving and being spawned at a tower. F4 is so bad but fun with friends because there is no stealth system. No not brainwash yourself. Even Return To Castle Wolfenstein has a per-AI alert state. When one sees you, alert has to be pressed or he shoots to alert the rest. Thief has a proper alert system and Deus Ex 1. Other games too like FarCry Instincts, where all AI go from calm to cautious permanently and alert. Hiding works better. ALL suppressed guns do make a sound so the key is on stealth kills or avoiding. Also cars have proper physics same as boats.

TL;DR: for older players FarCry and any new Ubisoft games are dead. No per-AI alert states, any missed shots is an alert, jumping silently is alerting AI, worst CAR physics worse than Cyberpunk somewhat or equal, samey missions built upon wasting player's time compared to all PS1/2/og xbox and most early 7th gen gaming.

Play older games including Assassins Creed before or till Black Flag. Play orignal Xbox games on any platform or PS2 and realise how much gameplay got features stripped away.",1657474315,1657474315,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I installed this game and OMG the women are HOT!!!! Then I met Mondstadt's Archon (The god of the city) and it was this SUPER CUTE GIRL!!. She was called Venti and was high-pitched, playful, 100000% my type! Naturally, as a red-blooded heterosexual alpha male, I got hard. I played the storyline for a few hours. Every time she got screen time, I would take several screenshots of her dialogue and animation for future studies. SHE EVEN HAS A DRAGON!!! SHES CUTE AND POWERFUL!!!!! After completing the quests, I visited the wish screen to see if I could get even more cute girls. Then I saw her, the goddess, the queen, VENTI! I immediately needed to get her. Grabbing my credit card, I bought more wishes, which costed my entire life savings of $100. It was worth it, Venti was my favourite girl after all. After 140 wishes, I got her. I was so excited, I went on reddit and joined every subreddit related to her. From that day on, I was a hardcore Venti fan. I put posted pictures of my queen all around my room, wrapped my car with her wallpaper and only bought Venti-sized drinks from starbucks. As all alphas do, I made sure to bust a nut to her at least 5 times every day.



My life was bliss with Venti around. She was everything I had, my pride and joy. Well, all until recently. I was speaking to my co-workers who also played Genshin Impact. Of course, I had to share with them about my goddess, Venti. So I told them about my c6 (I got 7 copies of her, for you non-gamers), R5 Elegy For The End (the best weapon for her) and my perfect artifact sets (80% cr, 240% cd). But then, they told me Venti was a boy! It turns out that he was not actually a girl, (I didnt notice his lack of booba) but acted like one! I was fooled! That was years of dedicated service, thousands of dollars and countless hours of reddit scrolling and nut busting, ALL WASTED! I could not control myself and broke down. I didn't care that I was crying in front of my co-workers, or that my boss was watching. My public humiliation could not compare to the grief I felt of knowing this. I had spent half my life telling people all about Venti and my love to him, I now realised how gay that was.



As a male, I have failed my brothers by simping for a male that looks feminine. I regret my decisions. I will now live out the rest of my life to better myself, by focusing on my true queen, Yae Miko. After my past mistake, I can now identify between males and females and I can proudly say that Yae Miko is a true female. I have spent millions of dollars on her, both in-game and her merch. She truly is, and will always be, better than every other girl and that backstabber Venti. Morale of the story, be careful who you simp for. I have caught whispers of another false female, Astolfo. Men who are new to this simping community, beware of him. Do not fall into the trap that I fell in for Venti.

I originally finished playing through this multiple times a year after it's release, but back then I had bought a physical copy of the game which I unfortunately lost. So when I saw that the gold edition with all the DLCs were on sale on steam I was bought it because all the nostalgia of trekking through the Kyrat's borderline mystical setting came flooding in.I am one of those people that severely missed the immersion Far Cry 2 conveyed through it's environment and overall gritty aesthetics, I felt that Far Cry 3 was lacking in that sense, but it seems that Ubisoft picked up on that factor when making Far Cry 4 because the immersion I have felt in this game is very similar to that of Far Cry 2. Even after picking it up in 2022 I am still mesmerised by Kyrat just like I was the first time I played the game. Maybe it is because I can resonate with the setting a lot. The small bits of Hindi spoken by the grunts, old Indian movie songs played by Rabi Ray, the mythology and the snowy mountains all remind of me places that I have gone to. The exploration, the environmental storytelling when uncovering Yalung's masks, and of course Shangri-La all form an intriguing setting. The different environments and the various types of guns all fir in well with the story. Although the main quest may be dogwater compared to Far Cry 3, the rest of the game is exceptional. I wouldn't buy it full price though. Wait for the gold edition to go on sale and then buy. It is an old game and the graphics might not be upto the taste of newer player, but the game is breathtaking. The outposts are also very well designed and the strongholds will be very challenging.

Well, If you have played Far Cry 3 and Far Cry 5, Far Cry 4 is a weird combo child of both of them (well, I now realise that a lot of mechanics were taken from this game into Far Cry 5). Mechanics work great, especially refreshing to be in the Himalayan setting. The colours ooze out, and its a feast for your eyes.

Pagan Min is by far the best villain of all time, and nothing can change my mind.
Story wise....it is engaging enough to know what happens next, but other wise not the absolute star of the show.
The Far Cry series is now known more for its enigmatic villains and freedom to do anything the player wants rather than a... well written story.
Some characters feel a bit off and annoying (Amita, especially), but other wise this was a blast.

The graphics and the landscape is amazing however can not be compared to Farcry 3 which is the original (in my opinion) the 4th Farcry is just a bit edited gameplay and a much more boring story. I have played the 2nd and the 3rd and personally the 4th is the most horrible out of those 3. 

Main reason is that most of the missions are pretty repetetive  and get very boring with every hour played. There is no interest in the main villain, even though he is a very unique you are not really interested to fight him as your friends (Sabal and Amita) would do the same thing with the country and your decisions does not change anyting until the last mission. 

Also those fucking buged areas in the game where you would just get stucked and can't move anywhere and especially those bugs used to apear in the middle of a mission and make me restart the whole ting again. Although I played till the end I would not recommended if you have played the other Farcry's especially the good old ones. If you are new and would like to play the game just for the graphics or for some other reason go ahed but personally Farcry 3 is the best and will be forever.",1656712965,1656712965,False,1,0,0.514925360679626465,0,True,False,False

Annoying once i am done with something i want it gone. 

A lot of the weapons are obsolete early. Lot of the skills are not that great. you can unlock most of everything before even unlocking anything past 25% of the map. so now it gets even MORE repetitive. 

mission starts are just all over the place with no real organization, just names of the people not even the names of the mission and if its story or not so you can just straight up miss stuff or start stuff you dont even want to start right away.

If you play nothing but shooters go for it because well there will be plenty of that. If you need more depth and variety and change you will get bored of this.

The DLC´s are great and I´m always in for some cool Yeti monster hunt or Durgesh escape, and especially these gyrocopters and Tuk-Tuk vehicles are an absolute blast and always good for a laugh.

Like in FC3 the plot is pretty simple, but the main antagonist steals the show. The main plot is actually pretty short, but there's still plenty to do. The side quests and such do get very repetitive, though. And the world, while beautiful, is pretty empty and exploration isn't very interesting in the long run. These are fun games, but nothing groundbreaking, really.

I for one, believe that Ubisoft creates some of the best gaming introductions and villains. Far Cry 4 is no exception, the intro to this game is classic and really gives you as a player an insight and thought on what you are about to embark on.

You are the protagonist Ajay Ghale in a Himalayan based countryside but a fictional area called Kyrat. Kryat is riddled with Narco- Guerrillas, rich Kirati inspired cultural history, and an ongoing civil war between the rebel Golden Path and the forces of Pagan Min. The game draws heavily from Nepalese influences including drawing the games real world design, gameplay and characters from local other countries, cultures and lore. 

There is much on improvement here, in terms of graphics, a diverse but very dense and large map, new weapons, animals to hunt, challenges, side quests, locations to explore.  Things such as utilizing and riding elephants, flying miniature helicopters called a gyro copter. You have the choice to attack with brute force or to have a stealthy approach. They have also introduced fortresses which are much tougher than a simple compound and require more planning before attacking. You are also encouraged to do other quests from a range of characters in the game to proceed further in the story as well as increase your skill points to use.

I have to applaud the characters in this game, incredible really. Golden path characters like Sabal and Amita struggling for power with one another while trying to lead the Country in the best way they see politically, traditionally, progressively and resourcefully fit. Whilst Pagan Min is the acclaimed antagonist to the story and is of a some what eccentric, calculated but a calm character, with his passive aggressive and carefree attitude takes on a different personality approach to previous, predictable hardcore villains in other games. 

There are also other side kicks and goons to both sides who bring richness and a story of there own which ties into the realm of and predominantly are dominoes to the story that is Kyrat.

I will say that, the game also at times is not without its psychedelic qualities. Taking you on many paths which appear hallucinogenic and transmundane like. As the player you will have choices along the golden path as the symbol of the people and this will reflect what occurs at the end of the game. 

I did not have many technical issues with this game if at all. It still requires Ubisoft interface to connect to whilst playing.

As Pagan Min says.... "" Ive cleared my calendar for you!...you and I are going to TEAR SHIT UP!""",1654663936,1654663936,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's FC3 with more sandbox tools, a weaker story, co-op gameplay, and Himalayan setting. It doesn't have the same charisma that FC3 had, and you wont be as invested in the main character as FC3, but its still totally worth your time.

PROS:
- Gameplay variety that actually uses the new mechanics without being gimmicky.
- Kept the FC3 mechanics that worked well.
- Fun and unique setting.
- Great gameplay feel, guns feel and sound great. I'll come back to play this game just for the elephant gun alone.
- Co-op play is a good addition, but is pretty restricted.
- Great bang for your buck. This game has a surprising amount of content, even it's not immediately obvious.

CONS:
- Forgettable story
- Forgettable characters all around. Protagonist is forgettable. Side villains are forgettable. Other main characters are forgettable, etc.
- The only characters I can actively remember from this game are the Radio DJ, and the main villain.

CONCLUSION:
If you liked FC3 for the gameplay loop, this game is for you. It's surprisingly easy to waste 10-20 hours in FC4 just messing around and trying out different gameplay styles. While it doesn't have FC3's charisma or character moments, this game very much has a charm of it's own. It's story and characters might be forgettable, but you'll remember the gameplay moments you create for yourself.

I would't recommend buying the game for the full price as Far Cry 4 can usually go on sale often, you just need to be patient. I bought this game for £7.79 ($9.73) when it was on sale a couple of months back (Jan 2022 - Mar 2022 approx.). I have been deeply fascinated with Far Cry as I was introduced to the game a couple of years back by an older sibling of mine.


Arguably, it is better than Far Cry 3, but while in the middle of completing Far Cry 3 but still haven't completed both, I quite like the story-line and environment of Far Cry 4. It is good for the quality and you'd be playing the game for hours on end at a time. Don't take my advice on it though. Have a look around, maybe check out some gameplay of it as-well. Whatever Far Cry game suits you best, I hope you find the right one for you. Thanks for reading!

Similar to Far Cry 3, you essentially start as an outsider, who evolves into a one man army, taking down the bad guy, who is a dictator by the name of Pagan Min, who is in a war with a faction known as the Golden Path, lead by Amita and Sabal, two very different people, with very different ideas for Kyrat's future.

Ajay as a protagonist starts out boring, and ends up - boring as you dont learn much about him. He does not seem to have any kind of reaction about suddenly being put into the middle of a raw civil war in a foreing country although that could be chalked up to the fact that according to the lore, Ajay was in the army when he was younger, and was fully aware that there was a civil war going on in Kyrat when he arrived. Right from the start you're thrown in to the action, and treated as the key piece to winning the war and everyone just accepts that, and the members of the Golden Path promise to help you accomplish the goal you came there  to do, scatter your mother's ashes at the peak of the highest mountain in Kyrat. 
As for other characters, I enjoyed the conflict between Amita and Sabal and how it intensified as the storyline progressed. As a returning character, we get to once again see Willis, who in Far Cry 3 was a delight, but in Far Cry 4 he was turned into an unlikeable douche. 

Kyrat as a map was beautiful, and the missions that took place in Shangri La were also a fun change of pace, though they were incredibly linear compared to the main game. 

While the gameplay is enjoyable and you can approach missions either guns blazing with grenade launchers and flamethrowers in your arsenal, or as an assassin sneaking around with simply a bow and your knife as your companions, towards the end I felt the game kept dragging on and getting repetitive. 

Many upgrades and weapons in the game are locked behind you completing additional tasks around the map, such as taking over radio towers, or killing animals for their skins, to craft equipment that would allow you to expand your arsenal, and the only drawback in that system is that some of the animals tend to be overpowered, and you can sometimes  even get stunlocked and die to an animal while trying to kill it to upgrade something you need.

Overall I'd say it was easily worth the 10€ I spent on it, and I would recommend the game to anyone who is reading this, especially if you're looking for a gameplay experience similar to Far Cry 3.

-REVIEW-

Imagine you’re a young adult going back to the country of your birth, attempting to honor the last wish of your late mother to bring her ashes home, only to find yourself caught up in a civil war between the haughty rich and the desperate poor, doing whatever you can to hopefully unseat the horrible dictator if only it will get you closer to fulfilling your parent’s last request.

Now imagine trying to remind yourself how important that task is while a local radio DJ spits out a bunch of material that constantly wavers between chuckle-worthy and cringe inducing. Yeah, this game is a bit more comical than the last, but don’t let that scare you off-it’s actually a lot of fun, and definitely improved on quite a few things from Far Cry 3.

Let’s start with the story, an element that, while still very enjoyable, I’m admittedly a bit divisive on. Ajay Ghale(yes, it’s pronounced more than one way in the game, so I’ll leave how you say it up to you) is coming home to return the ashes of his mother to her home country of Kyrat. His arrival in the country is a rather unpleasant one; he gets caught in the middle of a standoff between country officials and a group of rebels. He survives the minor onslaught, only to meet with Pagan Min, the ruler of Kyrat that rocks an arrogant mindset as much as he rocks a snazzy tux. From there, Ajay has a couple choices: listen to Pagan and be done with the game in 15 minutes(I’m pretty sure the whole world knows about this secret by now) or escaping the palace and, you know, PLAYING THE GAME, where Ajay will wind up joining with a movement called the Golden Path, a resistance movement started by Ajay’s late father, hoping to topple Pagan’s regime. Only with their aid does Ajay have a chance at returning his mother’s ashes to their proper resting place.

The question is, is this story better than Far Cry 3? I’ll be honest, it’s a tough question for me to answer. For one, FC4 definitely has a more interesting world, as there’s not just an evil group to stop, but also a team of allies to help. Furthermore, the Golden Path itself is caught in it’s own civil unrest, thanks to its two leaders, Sabal and Amita, constantly at each other’s throats over what path the movement should take. Amita favors more equality between genders and dropping outdated traditions, but isn’t above using unsavory means to make the group prosper, including profit by drugs and forced conscription. Sabal favors a more traditional foundation meant to preserve the group’s honor, but has no issue with denying women’s rights, executing Amita’s supporters, and putting a girl named Bhadra in a supposedly honorable position that is likely far more unsavory than it sounds. It makes for quite an interesting scenario.

That said, what I don’t like is that, while they are fun to talk to, most of the characters are pretty much there for getting quests from and that’s pretty much it. It’s kind of sad to be honest, especially since they all have enjoyable personalities; they can entertain you for sure, but only if they have a mission available. Far Cry 3’s side characters weren’t a whole lot better, but the fact that most of them were friends that you had to rescue gave them a bit more purpose in the story, and they all had fun personalities to boot. Furthermore, Pagan Min, despite being an amazing villain, is simply not as good as Vaas. Pagan has what I call “Sarevok Syndrome;” you see him at the beginning, and at the end, and one other short scene in a mountain prison, and that’s pretty much it. I’m not saying he had to be in every second of the game, but Vaas being around more in FC3 made him more exciting and unpredictable, as you had no idea when he’d pop in to ruin things. Pagan, meanwhile…well, he’s on the radio a few times! Yay?

Gameplay, on the other hand, is a definite improvement. Everything in this game is better. The gunplay feels better, animals are easier to find and hunt, skill point upgrades are more clearly defined in terms of when you can get them, driving is a bit more fun…even the radio towers are better! The actual act of capturing outposts hasn’t changed too much, but it still carries a good deal of excitement, especially when you go after lieutenant strongholds. The only thing I didn’t really enjoy were the Shangri-La side missions, simply because it was hard to get used to fighting with only a magic bow and little else(it was still enjoyable in terms of mythology). Yeah, there’s a ton of stuff to do in this game(Thanks, Ubisoft), but like in the past, you don’t have to do absolutely everything.

As is usually the case with ever increasing sequels(even if they’re indirect, as with this franchise), the graphics continue to improve, and this game looks really good, considering how old it is. Far Cry 3 already looked impressive to begin with, but this title raises the bar further still, especially in how the world looks. The character models are nice, but the island you move through, complete with forests, mountains, and even the interiors of strongholds, look very impressive. Sound design is also amazing, with well-performed voice acting(Troy Baker needs no introduction) and enjoyable music that, like in previous entries, amplifies the tribalistic setting that this game employs.

Say whatever you want about Ubisoft, but no matter how much they cling to old traditions. Sure they get old fast, and they certainly don’t guarantee good games. That said, Far Cry 4 was a blast for me; it was simply a better version of FC 3 in so many ways. Thanks for reading!",1652372958,1652372958,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

OK, sure, buy this is you're absolutely DESPERATE for more Far Cry, because that's ALL it is, but there's no way you'll want to play this given the options of playing Far Cry 3, Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon, Far Cry 5, Far Cry New Dawn, Far Cry Primal, Crysis, Crysis Warhead, Crysis 2, Crysis 3, Fallout 4 or the Outer Worlds. There's simply nothing better about Far Cry 4 than any of these other open world games from approximately this same generation.

Above all, Far Cry 4 is by FAR the LEAST engaging setting and cast of characters I have ever seen in a Far Cry game, like, they're bad, as in PATHETIC. ALL YOU SEE IS MOUNTAINS IN FRONT OF YOUR FACE EVERYWHERE, IT DEFEATS THE PURPOSE OF THE FAR CRY SERIES' OPEN WORLD OF ALLURING VISTAS! As soon as I got into the game I simply didn't care about the entire place or any of its denizens, and the huge mountain valley thing is just a trashy way to make an open world game, you see nothing but steep hills, cliff faces and upward climbs everywhere you look and it's just a chore to navigate, as well as not being very pretty, despite standard Far Cry photorealism, on account of this kind of mountain valley environment being just boring to begin with, with a boring color palette and annoying rope-climbing obstacles literally everywhere to the point of it being a nuisance (you use a grappling hook, whoopie, it's freakin' LAME). The only way to have made this better would have been to completely axe the grappling hook in favor of making some legit alpinist parkour the equivalent of Mirror's Edge in the mountains, but I doubt Ubisoft would put THAT much effort into gameplay mechanics as they seem content to simply continue re-skinning Far Cry with minor adjustments, and, regardless, it WOULDN'T have made the setting any more palatable. It's just an ugly world, and not fun with nothing really cool about it beside it being more Far Cry if you're really that desperate.

In Far Cry 3 we had Vaas, one of the coolest and most memorable video-game villains since Sephiroth, and Citra, who was an engaging and sexy supporting character and eye-candy. Brody being a college kid in the islands with his friends, girlfriend and brother and getting caught up in bad business with Vaas was a great setup for adventure that felt like you were in a movie similar to something like The Beach or Into the Blue. Where does Far Cry 4 put you? IN NORTH KOREA? OK Kim-Jong Ubi, whatever, I'd rather be in the Vietnam War or something than fighting your weird, re-imagined hybrid of the KPA and the Khmer Rouge in the Tibetan Himalaya. I think the big thing here is that Ubi simply tried too hard to do something very different and none of it paid off.

I am not recommending playing this above any of the other games I mentioned, it's simply not worthwhile when it takes twice the disk space of the vastly superior and infinitely more entertaining Far Cry 3 and Blood Dragon games combined, which were actually fun gems, particularly for their time. Far Cry 4 is just more of the same done worse in a time when there are so many better games to invest your time in.

DELETED.

- Open world feels quite empty and repetetive.... after 39 hours I can not remember any locations - because they do not feel special at all
- Missions.... also highly repetetive
- Story... borring - I do not even finish the game because it never made me wonder what is happening next. Feels like a action storry written by a 12 year old. You can see the effort but it is not really klicking....

For example, when a wolf is too close to you, there is no way you can see it, and when you see it, is because is killing you already.

The graphics are impresive, but the repetitive gameplay and the overall experience are not woth a buy. The looting is boring, the crafting is boring, the upgrades are boring, the game is sooooo boring like this review.

In a large mixing bowl, whisk together buttermilk, hot sauce (optional, for added flavor), salt, and pepper in a mixing bowl. Add in chicken pieces. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate 4 hours.
When ready to cook, pour the vegetable oil in a skillet until it is about 3/4 inch deep. Heat to 350 degrees.
Prepare the breading by combining the flour, cornstarch, onion powder, garlic powder, oregano, basil, white pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, and salt in a gallon sized resealable plastic bag or shallow dish. Mix it thoroughly.
Working one at a time, remove chicken pieces from buttermilk mixture. Shake it gently to remove the excess. Place it in the breading mix and coat thoroughly. Tap off the excess.
Place the breaded chicken into the 350 degree oil. Fry 3 or 4 pieces at a time. The chicken will drop the temperature of the oil so keep it as close to 350 degrees as possible. Fry each piece for 14 minutes, turning each piece about half way through, until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees F.
Remove from the oil and place on paper towels. Let them rest for at least 10 minutes before serving.",1538271643,1650535192,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Best one yet, to me at least.

I loved Far Cry 3; everything about it was beautiful, from level design to combat mechanics. Far Cry 4 takes all that a step further. If you loved Far Cry 3 then give this a go, you won't be disappointed.

There's plenty of side missions and extra content to keep you busy for months; my first play through took me a little over 25 hours and that was nowhere near fully complete. Honestly, the open world is so well put together you'll find yourself just driving around, slotting the odd enemy you find or just hunting...just watch out for honey badgers, the vicsious little shits.

Storyline is solid enough, with the usual misanthropic Far Cry flavour to it proving once again that people really are just a bit crap, and no matter what you do, evil will usually find a way through one way or the other.

Graphics are good, game play and combat is smooth and there aren't too many bugs; I certainly didn't find any that were game breaking.

The one gripe I have, and it was the same with 3, is UPlay. I already have a similar piece of software...it's called Steam and it works just fine. The only bonus with it is it does give you the option of adding a weapon for free (if you have the UPlay points, obviously) and a weapon bundle for PvP. Honestly, I'd take not having that as a trade of for not having to have UPlay installed. 

Bottom line, go for it. It's certainly worth the full price (25.99 GBP at time of writing this) and if you have the opportunity to get it on sale then definitely go for it, because that'd be an absolute steal.",1547213515,1648890387,False,0,0,0.588850677013397217,0,True,False,False

Lost letters and journal pages are much the same, and no specific award is given for completing the Shangri-La storyline other than a decoration in a half-complete homestead.) What leads up to obvious final missions, like Mr. Chiffon's designer gear, is cut off with a literal letter about how he was ""discovered"" and forced to flee, which makes no sense. There are perhaps five characters you regularly talk to, which is enough for a good game that takes place in the middle of nowhere, but there are gaps in their story lines that make little sense.

Much of the art work is rehashed repeatedly, but is consistently treated like it's a brand-new, explorable thing. The map is packed down with an absurd density of busywork, but little original terrain or artwork. There are maybe six original enemies, none of which are particularly intelligent, and about as many vehicles.

The wingsuit is about as useful as a noose around the neck, as it feels like a coin flip whether landing is going to get you killed; meanwhile, wolves are taking half a clip of ammo and continuing to charge you like nothing's the matter. Traversing the map is virtually saturated with ""random"" karma events, which seem to consistently be ""protect from animal"", ""kill lieutenant"", ""kill slaver"", and ""fight skirmish"", which all amount to more-or-less the same thing. Most of the missions also amount to the same thing, with a weird lack of consistency—sometimes you have to loot a commander's dog tag, sometimes you have to kill him with a specific weapon and take a picture, sometimes you have to hide the body, but they never go into why or how.

By the end of it, I didn't give a hoot about anybody getting attacked by anything, I just wanted it over with. Only in FC4 can a snow leopard, a wolf, and an eagle fight over the same goat, and then immediately turn their weirdly-hunger-grazed attention to you. Yes, that did actually happen to me.

As I said, the writing is strong, but you can feel where the project went off the rails, and this is a tragedy as the foundation of the game is really good. I would recommend it on sale, but with reservations. If you're looking for a good blow-up-installations-in-exotic-locales game, I would suggest maybe a Just Cause game; or perhaps Far Cry 3.

This game had about six hours of great plot line, but stretched out into nearly thirty because of the sheer amount of busywork. Additionally note that Steam continues to count your play time as long as UPlay is open, so many of the reports of playtime are biased higher than they should be. I definitely didn't play for 70 hours; it just felt like I did, and it was a little belittling.",1647987678,1648696164,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Consequently, I liked Far Cry 3 quite much, too. The superb game concept was inherited by Far Cry 4. It is a good sequel.

So on my part, there is not much not to like. The mountain landscape is amazing, the fight mechanics are awesome, the story is okay so far. This Pagan Min guy is a good counter-protagonist [SPOILER=1] as he is not clearly on the black-or-white side of the story, in this game no one is [/SPOILER] but falls behind Vaas Montenegro of Far Cry 3. So to say, in my opinion every villain falls behind Vaas Montenegro in gaming history, thanks to actor Michael Mando.

Big plusses are:
A) fully customizable UI (which also makes sense, disabling some elements won´t make the game unplayable)
B) mini chopper called ""buzzer"" is awesome and lets you cheese tower climbing (thank god for that)
C) riding elephant is also awesome and bizzarely fun
D) really good weapon pool that is fun to use
E) coop if you are into that and have gamer friends (I don´t have any :´()

A) loads of bloat, so so much of it (just do what you want and what you need to unlock all weapons you want)
B) almost pointless crafting and rpg leveling elements
C) hunting is not fun at all and wildlife is overly agressive

The atmosphere is beautiful. That feeling when you wing-suit from a decent height, passing by valleys, feeling the breeze due to it's well executed ambient sounds, feels real good. Not only it feels great from above, the ground prespective is jaw dropping aswell.
It has variety of animals, fishes & birds scattered throughout it's gigantic world. Driving feels good & also there are multiple landmarks marked as 'interesting places to visit'.
Guns feel great, side missions are great, upgrades are meaningful & feel deserved, story is decent & offers an overall unique one time experience.

I particularly like FPS games but if you are grabbing this game for the open-world or the story there are so many better options. The world is so repetitive, every outpost, every fortress, every special mission area feels exactly the same. It's just old-style stone and wooden buildings, some rocks and some forest. Kyrat is supposed to be a country, but there are maybe 4 shanty villages across the entire map. No big towns at all, no modern infrastructure beyond a few military buildings. It just doesn't make sense for the narrative to be about this big revolution when there just aren't any people.

If you've played Far Cry 3 you've played this game. The side quests, outposts, everything about this game has been done before. And if you want to get the game for Pagan Min, he is barely in it. And much of the time you see him he isn't interacting directly with you unlike Vaas of Hoyt from 3.

If you are easily entertained maybe this is the game for you, but if you want to experience something new and have played Farcry already you should probably call it quits on the series. If you haven't played Farcry yet, play 2 or 3. I see no reason to make a point of playing this game.

You play as Ajay Ghale, getting back to the nation of your birth, the lush backwoods and harsh snow covered peaks of Kyrat, to fulfill your mom's final request of spreading her remains on a place called Lakshmana. This huge and unpredictable nation offers its guests opportunity and risk. You rapidly end up caught in a rebellion to topple the brutal system of Pagan Min,  a figure known as much for his sense of style and charisma as for his cruelty and naked brutality. Exploring the treacherous landscape, you observe your not entirely set in stone by the decisions you make on the grounds of Kyrat as there is a fight for leadership between two characters namely, Sabal and Amita. 
In Far Cry 4, you'll conquer stronghold outposts and fortresses from the back of a 6-ton elephant and take to the skies as you rain down explosives from your gyro-copter. The upward scene of the Himalayas isn't simply a beautiful background, but a playground that urges the player to battle, hunt and explore, grappling cliffs or even launching in the air, diving into the valley beneath in a controlled free fall with your wing suit. 
You'll carry with you a truly unique armory of weapons that allow you to play your way, whether it's killing, sneaking or hard and fast attack. At the point when all else ends up short, animals can be your greatest partners or your most prominent hazard, as Kyrat's wild follows through on the guarantee of a genuine open world story processing factory.

Far Cry 4 is a first-person shooter which has Ajay Ghale as the protagonist.

Uncomparable to FarCry 3 story vise. Good thing you are reminded of your purpose in Kyrat in every mission, otherwise you would have no idea what are you doing there. The story doesn´t feel as organic and ""flowing"" as it does in FarCry 3. In FarCry 4 it feels more like a mission after mission and they don´t seem to follow each other at all. Many missions were glitched and when I finished the game ( decided not to shoot Pagan Min ) and when he flew away in his helicopter, the game froze and it completely killed the whole cinematic and vibe of the whole game.

There's so much depth & detail in terms of ambition of the original project, they had just received the love and fandom from Far Cry 3 & it's so obvious they were going for another home run; while I haven't played FC3 properly,

I just wish this game had received the tech love that FC3 received, it's obvious that it hasn't been tuned to more recent golden standards, example being the low resolution logo in the menu, certain shading issues, fps issues; but it beats 60fps- on a 50"" flat screen any-day lmao.

On top of that I was too young to fully understand the hook of the FC franchise 

(That being that they have a main protagonist each game and it isn't the player)

Pagan Min was a fucking crazy & beautiful person for a FC villain, especially at such a young age it was an intoxicating experience,

The vibrant colours, guns, stories within this game make for a gorgeous & unique experience; I never got over the unique atmosphere of Kyrat & Shangri-La.

Some extraordinarily bad design and balancing choices were made with this game that just has me constantly thinking WTF??? By far the stupidest thing in this game is you constantly get attacked by hawks, and these hawks are MORE powerful than any other enemy in the game, in terms of how much damage they do to you. You'll be doing any number of normal game tasks from traveling to unlocking towers, fast travel points etc...and every 5 minutes a hawk will dive bomb you and take away 95% of your health (it seems to scale with your max health). Normally, when doing mundane tasks, this just means you have to waste a healing syringe, but if any other aggressive animals or NPCs are nearby, this means death. You'll take on entire camps filled with NPC enemies armed with assault rifles, flame throwers, sniper rifles etc...and the entire camp will still do LESS DAMAGE TO YOU THAN A SINGLE HAWK (I'm not exaggerating! it's that stupid!). If you hear a hawk scream, and then turn to face it and try to ADS with your gun to shoot it, YOU CAN'T! If the hawk gets within 15 feet of you, it forces you into an animation. Yes, it's still 15 feet away from you but, you can't ADS and shoot it! This is what makes it truly frustrating and the stupidest game feature I've ever seen in my 38 year PC gaming career (yes I've been playing PC games since 1984).

As if the hawk wasn't enough, other animals are also grossly overpowered. A little badger can also kill you in about 3 seconds, but takes 4 or 5 sniper shots to the head to take down. Yes, no animal in FC4 can be killed with a single sniper bullet to the head (as in real life). Tigers take 6 sniper bullets to the head, and badgers, the size of a small dog, take 4 or 5 (I forget). The problem is of course, that by the time you put the 3rd or 4th sniper bullet into their head, they are now in melee range, so it's literally impossible to kill ANYTHING with a sniper rifle before it reaches melee range and takes 95% of your health with each of their attacks. Yes, that's right - your sniper bullets (to the head) do about 15-20% of their health, and their melee attacks do 95% of your health regardless of where they hit. The enemy NPCs also seem to take way more bullets than a human should be capable of taking, but at least they are somewhat more balanced in that a bow can one shot kill them, even with a body shot. I do think it's silly though that you can kill NPC enemies way easier and faster with a bow and arrow, than you can with an AK-47. So every ounce of realism and immersion is destroyed in this game by poor design choices. This isn't vastly different than FC3, but FC4 is just constant stupidity with the hawks and other animals. The gameplay in FC3 was much less annoying, even though there were still slightly overpowered animals, it wasn't nearly as annoying as FC4.

You might think I am over complaining about the hawks, but trust me, within a few hours of playing the game, you will realize how f#$#$# stupid the hawks are, and how stupid it is that 5 sniper shots to the head of something isn't enough, and that animal will then kill you with 2 swipes.

Other semi-negatives - I mean it's basically FC3, but worse. Let's face it, FC games are all just the same at this point, but with a slightly different looking map and slightly different story. I knew that when I bought it though, and I was ok with that, as long as they executed the game well, I didn't care if it followed a generic formula. I enjoy the general game design of open world, explore, fight bad guys, complete quests, hunt animals for upgrades, etc...that's all fine, but you still have to use basic common sense when making design choices. Hawks shouldn't be the most deadly enemy in the game, and popping up every 5 minutes out of nowhere.

The good: the game looks nice, as FC games all generally do. It's a nice open world to explore and using a glider or a helicopter is cool. I think it's a shame that you can't pull up on the glider at all so you are forced to descend at a 45 degree angle at all times....how much nicer the glider would be if it were more realistic and you could catch air and actually gain altitude or at least maintain altitude. But instead, gliders are very short rides and you can't stay in air more than 20-30 seconds....Same thing with the squirrel suit - you basically nose dive straight at the ground and can't stay in the air for more than 10-20 seconds. Hang gliding or squirrel suiting around the map for realistic amounts of time would be AMAZING, and I'm surprised that they severely handicapped these features. I would probably just spend a few hours gliding or squirrel suiting around the map every time I played, but they had to ruin that experience.....

Far Cry 4 could have been an amazing game! But instead we see so much lost potential. Animals are severely imbalanced. Weapons mean nothing! A powerful sniper rifle becomes a BB gun, and a bow and arrow becomes the most powerful and effective weapon in the game. One of best possible experiences in the game (gliding around the map) is ruined because they didn't want us to enjoy it or spend hours doing it. The story, as in every other FC game I have played, is so stupid that I wish I could skip all the cut scenes, but for some reason FC is the only game in gaming history that won't let you skip cut scenes. The story and poor dialogue makes you cringe, but you are forced to watch it. I literally take my headphones off every time a cut scene starts because I know it's going to be stupid AF.

If you want to experience FC4, but the better version of it, buy FC3 (still plenty of flaws, but not nearly as many). If you already have bought and played FC3, don't bother, FC4 will be a let down.",1645076008,1645076008,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Completely different setting, but with similar aspects as the previous games, charismatic characters and villain, beautiful graphics for the year it was made in and I could go on and on, that's how much I love this game.

The basic premise is that you control Ajay Ghale, a young man who fled his homeland of Kyrat for the US as a child. Following his mother’s death, he has returned to Kyrat with her ashes and become embroiled in a years-long conflict between the tyrannical King Pagan Min and a rebel group called the Golden Path. Gameplay mostly consists of exploring the Kyrati landscape, climbing towers to reveal the map, capturing outposts from Pagan Min’s forces, and undertaking various campaign missions and sidequests like rescuing hostages, assassinating key targets, and escorting supply convoys.

The gameworld is probably Far Cry 4’s greatest strength, as it builds on the solid foundation laid by 3. The Nepal-inspired Kyrat feels much more like a real location with its own history and culture compared to the somewhat generic Rook Islands in 3. Missions take you to farms, mountain villages, shrines, ruins, and more, and fantastic art direction and music design help the setting feel more substantial that the usual FPS playgrounds. The mountainous landscape makes traversal more vertical, so obtaining a wingsuit much earlier than in 3 and the newly-added gyrocopter keep navigation fresh.

Gunplay is similarly strong, and there is a nice difficulty curve which makes unlockable weapons and skills fun and useful without completely spoiling the challenge (though a few endgame guns turn most missions into a joke). On a related note, XP and money are plentiful through world exploration and collectables, so you never feel strong-armed into a particular playstyle like all-stealth with melee takedowns in order to scrape up any bonus rewards. I finished the game with all skills and all but one arena-mode unlocked weapon, and still had loads of undiscovered map locations and collectables. 

Storywise, I can’t decide how this compares to 3. Ajay, Pagan, and the Golden Path leaders Amita and Sabal are interesting characters with compelling dialogue and a consistent presence throughout the story. The themes of family history, revolution, and national identity also resonate more closely than 3’s “Heart of Darkness” man-turns-savage narrative. However, the story’s conclusion is less satisfying than 3’s despite a nicely foreshadowed buildup, and I immediately restarted the game to view a bonus alternate ending (wait at the dinner table for about 13 minutes).

On a more impactful note, Far Cry 4’s other major flaw is that the open world is a bit too crowded: you can barely walk 10 yards in a given direction without getting attacked by an animal, run over by a civilian vehicle (at least Pagan’s troops shout that are going to ram you), or encountering Golden Path members in need of help. These types of world events tend to overlap, and the resulting chaos can lead to frustration like losing body armor and having your stealth spoiled in the middle of a mission. To add insult to injury, many of these random events do not offer any meaningful reward except a separate XP called Karma, which after a one-time skilltree prerequisite and minor shop discount, has no purpose beyond summoning useless AI allies in battle.

The overly-crowded open world has one other notable drawback in that with so much XP and money available, there is little incentive to track down every location, collectible, and side mission. Unlike Assassin’s Creed, there is no special reward for 100%, so when you have maxed-out skills and the best weapons, and see that there are still dozens of icons on your map, there is little fun left apart from finishing the story.

Criticism aside, this is still one the best FPS or open-world games I’ve played, and I might give it another run someday. The setting, scenery, and action are top notch, and I even told my partner I’m interested in visiting South Asia thanks to the locations, art, and, and music in this game. I’m looking forward to making my way through the rest of the Far Cry franchise, and seeing if any of them can match this!

Absolutely awe-inspiring, gorgeous world based on Nepal. You can easily lose yourself in the world just looking at the views. The snowy mountains and lush forests really make the world Ubisoft designed to be awesome to look at. 

The story is really good. I would say Far Cry 3's story outranks it, but it's really close. The antagonist, Pagan Min, is also easily my favorite Far Cry villain so far. His wit, performance and amazing voice actor really makes you enjoy dealing with him. 

The gunplay was improved A LOT since Far Cry 3. Guns feel more... ""weighty"" so-to-speak. In Far Cry 3, they felt a little more arcade-yish. Far Cry 4 made playing with them a lot more... immersive I guess? I'm not sure how to explain it. The gunplay just feels a lot better than in Far Cry 3 is my point lol

The only cons I have about the game is that there's just... too much to do. For some people that's awesome, but there are a CRAP ton of repetitive sidequests, and so... so many collectables. Seriously. Ubisoft has always been known to torture completionists by putting an insane amount of collectables in their game but I think this game has the most. There's posters, journals, lost letters, mani wheels and masks. Each have 50+ to collect. The posters alone have 150. Insane. Thankfully, I'm not a completionist and couldn't give less of a damn about them. [b]HOWEVER, I HIGHLY SUGGEST YOU READ MOHAN'S JOURNALS ONLINE[/b] (or collect them ingame. There's not as many to collect as the other collectables) They really add to the story, imo. 

All-in-all, I highly recommend it. Very fun with tough decisions you're forced to make. Now I'm off to play Far Cry: Primal!",1643421678,1643421810,True,26,1,0.745527327060699463,2,True,False,False

If you liked the previous Far Cry games, you will like the gameplay in this one, as it follows the previous likable and nice gameplays however i felt like the story in this one was not exciting, and same was the ending, very meh.

But honestly this game feels more like far cry 3.5 rather than an individual game, the weapon handling, the same non-innovative outpost system (the reinforcement system was kinda better tho) and many more things are just straight up copied from far cry 3 without any improvements, additions and innovation.

What they should actually have copied from far cry 3 was their amazing story line, someone coming from far cry 3 will definitely find something amiss when comparing the story lines.

Nonetheless, it is still a fun game to play and with the new far cry 6 DLC the game becomes a very important part of the vast far cry universe. 

A few tips/random stuff:
- You will find numerous references to both far cry 2 and 3 look very closely while playing.
- Don't buy the DLCs to this game the prices are very high and the DLCs are not that special.
- Do enjoy the Crab Rangoon.

Far Cry 4 is, hands down, one of the best open-world shooters I've ever played. There's a certain charm to the setting of this game which makes me want to keep coming back to it again and again. The atmosphere in this game is simply unparalleled, compared to any other Far Cry game out there.
Most people consider this game to be inferior to Far Cry 3, but they couldn't be more wrong. I would actually prefer this game to its predecessor (I know this is an unpopular opinion), simply because it's, in my opinion, so much better in many aspects, and I'm dead serious.


[b] Gameplay: [/b]

The weapons sandbox is vast and the gunplay is tight and intense. You can apply tactical attachments and paintwork to your weapons, which are unique to every weapon that exists in this game. You can buy pre-customized ""signature"" weapons on liberating bell towers, which have their own perks. You can liberate enemy-controlled outposts, which once freed can become a fast-travel location. There's a crafting mechanic which allows you to hunt animals and use their skins to craft holsters, bags and pouches, or collect leaves to craft syringes used for various occasions like healing, hunting, swimming underwater longer and more. The enemy takedowns are really satisfying and evoke a sense of achievement once you successfully manage to kill an enemy using stealth. The AI, unfortunately, is kind of dumb. I encountered a number of annoying bugs and glitches, and although it didn't take away much from the experience, I'll list some of them below:

-> [i] Friendly soldiers fire at you and hit you with their vehicles for no reason. (Rare) [/i]
-> [i] Enemies and predators don't notice you while you're crouching right in front of them. (Rare) [/i]
-> [i] NPCs and animals glitch out and start falling across the map on dying. (Rare) [/i]
-> [i] A slight scratch on a friendly soldier from your side causes everyone in the area to turn against you and start shooting at you. (Common) [/i]

Now, the fall damage has been optimized way better than Far Cry 3 (where falling from 3 feet made you lose a quarter of your health), and the platforming overall, has been greatly improved.
There's a good number of vehicles (boats, cruisers, autorickshaws, jeeps, trucks, buzzers, sedans, hatchbacks, parachutes...). You can even ride elephants in this game, which is honestly one of the best things that I've come to enjoy out of it. There's also one cool part in the game where Ajay is in a trance-like state and as he enters a fight in his dream, the framerate knowingly locks to 30 fps, making it seem like a slow-motion, action-filled moment, which is so simple yet so effective that it's mind-blowing. Of course, you first need to be able to run the game at over 60 fps to actually enjoy and appreciate this moment, but it's there nevertheless, and it is amazing. The gameplay, in short, is diverse and never gets boring or overused.

[u][b] 7.5/10 in Gameplay [/b][/u]


[b] Story: [/b]

Compared to Far Cry 3, where the story, although decent, felt way too dragged and filled with clichés, this game is such a huge improvement. It gives you numerous choices from time to time which actually affect the story and gameplay. It's certainly no ""Detroit: Become Human"" or any Telltale game in terms of branching narratives; and the choice given to alter the story and gameplay is quite minimal and limited, but it rarely gives the illusion of free choice and it's set up in a way that makes you question what would have happened had you chose something else.  The thing it does really well though, following its predecessor, is explore the psychological boundaries of the protagonist and question your morality and decisions taken throughout the course of the story.
Pagan Min is an intriguing and well-written antagonist, and although he has less screen-time, you can't forget that he controls Kyrat and he's the one you have to defeat in order to save the Golden Path throughout the length of the game, simply because he's such an interesting character. This guy surpasses Vaas (unpopular opinion) in every aspect. He's dynamic, more well-written, and actually has motivations and things that he cares for, instead of being a psycho that's just pure evil. Also, he's voiced by Troy Baker... I mean what else can I say?
Aside from the main story, there's a Kyrati mythological side story set in ""Shangri-La"", a mysterious place known to be once freed from the demons by a saint named Kalinag. In this story, you get to collect five ""Thangkas"" in the map, each of which transports you into the shoes of Kalinag, and you get to relive his myth in the form of five linear missions. This side-story was so well done and presented, that had it not been in the game, I would have enjoyed it less.
In addition to this, there are several secret locations, side quests, notes and journal entries that you can visit, complete and collect, which give context to the lore of this game's setting. Engaging and thought-provoking, that's mainly what the story is.

[b] 7.5/10 in Story [/b]


[b] Graphics: [/b]

There's not much to say about the graphics except that they're absolutely stunning. This is one of the best-looking games ever, and it's not an overstatement. There's a full 24-hour day cycle (which depends on how fast you're moving on the map, literally), and the Himalayan backdrops look gorgeous during... well, every time of the day. The world is quite detailed, with intricate textures and shaders on the ground, water, leaves, clouds and animals. The fur on animals looks amazingly detailed and beautiful on enabling ""Simulated Fur"" in graphics settings. The color palette and art style is quite beautiful and interesting, and complement the story and setting really well.
It's not perfect, however. The tessellations are (rarely) off and look like blocks of textures, and the grass sometimes floats above the ground wherever there's a slope of some kind. But that's just me nitpicking, and these details are only visible upon very close inspection.

[u][b] 9/10 in Graphics [/b][/u]

[b] Soundtrack: [/b]

Inclusion of good music during cutscenes and various gameplay scenarios is a fundamental in video games, provided they're used when necessary. While Far Cry 3 had some good soundtracks used properly, the majority of cutscenes felt as if nothing was at stake and everything was just an exposition dump and mission brief, because of the complete absence of any kind of music.
Far Cry 4, fortunately, addresses this problem quite well. And I mean really, really well.
The diversity and quality of the soundtrack of Far Cry 4 is just phenomenal. From ancient Indian music and melodious, atmospheric flutes in the Shangri-La missions, to local licensed tracks during driving vehicles, to intense, captivating music during fights and stealth missions, Far Cry 4 keeps your interest intact through its music. It's amazing.

[u][b] 9/10 in Soundtrack [/b][/u]


Far Cry 4 has an engaging and interesting story, a phenomenal soundtrack, well-written characters and an astounding setting. It is severely undermined by the Far Cry community, for little reason. Go play it. It's really good.

Defend the objective 
Rescue the hostages
Destroy the objective
Also the forced stealth in some missions drives me absolutely insane. If you want to play Far Cry 4 to enjoy a well thought out story STAY AWAY from Far Cry 4. The story in this game is so BORING. The character you play as is sooo BORING AND BLAND he has no personality he just blindly follows Amita and Sabal's orders depending on who you choose. On the topic of Amita and Sabal the choice you make does not matter one single bit. I like how they give you a choice to pick Amita or Sabal but make it so it does not matter. The two characters are also so unlikable I can barely stand them. Funnily enough it seems like the character(Pagan)  with the most personality is more interesting even tho he has way less screen time than Amita and Sabal. The gunplay is just straight ripped from Far Cry 3. I tried liking this game I really did but in the end I just could not bring myself to finish it it was just to boring. Do not get this game if you are looking for a good Far Cry do not even get it if you just want a fun game. Just get Far Cry 3 or Far Cry 5 even both are better and funner games to play.

Thank you for reading hopefully I saved you some money and sanity.

I mean I got it for less than a tenner because I wanted some brainless FPS action, and that's what I got, but that's as far as the game goes, really. Has all the problems of FC3, in fact it's really just the same game only with different graphics. Haven't tried FC5 or 6, because now I have a strong reason to believe they are also the same exact game only with different graphics.

Pros: 
Scenery is pretty
No silly monsters or anything like that as enemies
""open world""

Cons:
The world is open, but really just empty. You can't hope to find anything truly interesting anywhere, so why bother exploring? Also the world looks exactly the same everywhere, so after the first 15 minutes you've seen it all even if you've only seen 5% of the actual map area. 

The characters are just extremely caricaturish and shallow, everyone has like 2 lines of dialogue and that's as deep as their personalities go. The main villain initially comes across as a totally out-of-control psychopathic homicidal maniac (who for some reason talks and dresses like some London Soho gay TV-personality), and the big plot twist is that there isn't any. He remains just as homicidal psychopath all the way to the ending, and if the game is trying to give you some mixed feelings about him it's failing badly.

There's quite few different guns and weapons in the game, but because they are all more or less equally good, you just end up choosing one or two and sticking with those, so then you'll have like 27 others which you never have to touch.

There's like half a million 'side quests' available in the world, but they are all completely pointless since all they give you is money and xp, and you don't really NEED either to progress through the main story line.

You can buy some 'perks' with the xp, but they're all completely pointless so after a while you just can't be arsed anymore, and you have 35 skill points unused, and half of the available perks unselected. 

The main story line takes about that 30 hours to complete, not even that if you never bother with any side quests and stuff. It offers no real surprises or really anything truly impressive story-wise.

So in conclusion, if you just want to shoot at some human enemies AND the game happens to be in a big discount, then maybe yeah, otherwise naaaah.",1641581378,1641582015,False,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

this time is kyrat a country, that have beautiful scenery and a pretty decent map size with many things to do like hunting, crafting, saving hostage, climbing tower and many more, 

even though the gameplay the same as in another far cry games every far cry games have its own unique story and villain and this is the good thing cause you enjoy a new storya and meeting another antagonist with different background this time you need to fight Pagan min one of my favorites antagonist in video games unlike father joseph seed in far cry 5, pagan min is much more connected to Ajay our protagonist since pagan is the one Ajay mother love in the mission and chatter between Ajay and  Pagan you going to know more about what Ajay parent doing in kyrat.

there are some bad things about the game first of all its going to be exhausting doing hunting and doing side mission cause its the same mission all over again with a different challenge, and the second part is economy in far cry 4 its pretty hard to earn enough money for buying weapon and ammo you could stole some weapon from the enemies but some weapon are unique to the store and certain area that you could miss.

the game story is average outside of a few great scene with the game main vilain but the main problem is that this feel a lot's similar to Far cry 3 , not much has been improved outside of the visuals.

you still have a good variety of weapons , from pistols to smg , AR , light machine guns and shotguns and I have to say the double barrel shotgun are fun to use , especially the shawed off double barrel you can use as a side weapon.

It's overall a mindless fun game with a large open map where the pace get broken once in a while by some highly cinematic missions , you have multiple endings but the game is so repetitive I don't think most peoples will play the game again to really try to get all of them.

The main gameplay loop is as Far Cry as Far Cry gets; this is why the game gets a recommendation from me. If you like the formula the series has been based upon since FC2, you will continue to like it here.

That being said, there are significant flaws here, which make it a weaker entry than FC3, Blood Dragon, and 5.

The biggest of these is that Ajay Ghale might as well be a voiceless protagonist. He is a cipher, a nothing, a blank slate, but unlike more meaty RPGs, you cannot fill that slate with much of anything. The reason for him to go to Kyrat makes a little sense, but as for why he stays and fights an insurgency against the tyrant Pagan Min? Not really well motivated. 

The two NPCs he interacts with are some of the most insufferable prats in all of video games. Amita and Sabal are the pruported ""leaders"" of the Golden Path resistance, but they spend the entire game bickering with one another over stupid shit, shit that won't matter at all until they win. Ajay's role is to play middle-man, and ultimately choose who comes out on top, but he is so voiceless in their squabbles there is no rhyme or reason for who you choose to support or why. 

Pagan Min and the story of Ajay's origins are a far more interesting story than the Golden Path resistance, but the game seems to go out of its way to avoid telling it. Pagan Min, who is an otherwise great FC villain, spends very little time on screen and only a little bit more talking to the player via radio chatter.

If you're fine running around Kyrat (a very good and visually stunning setting) doing the usual FC busywork and side-questing, you can have a lot of fun here.

Also love how you're not going to survive every encounter and thats ok. Games that make you fear failing only succeed in making you not want to play. 
Player animations are cool, the cut-scenes are well done (if a little over-acted) and it looks awesome! 
The atmosphere and geography while being a bit repetitive is picturesque.
Love the open world freedom. Also a very large map. 
The crafting, store and RPG elements (choices/paths) add depth
There's variety in how you take out your enemies
some great realism elements
you can ride a f*cking elephant
story is so-so; when it gets too serious its a bit lame.
 
CONS:
Wish I could make the guns louder. Sound beautiful. There is virtually no sound options. 
Needs to be a distinction between locations under ground and/or hidden away with a map marker (above/below you rather than one-size-fits-all)
Difficulty finding a good balance for nighttime view with gamma/contrast though might be my monitor
Works great on old CPUs as long as you have a good gfx card
I can tell this will get a bit repetitive, but i'm 11 hours in and spent about the same amount # of money on the game.

Game crashed a couple of times, I think I've died twenty times to my character diving headfirst into the ground because I held down the sprint button while jumping a wide gap and he thought I wanted to pull out my wingsuit, other interactions in the game are a mess. Very long loading times even on a machine thats only using high speed SSDs for storage. It takes itself half serious, which is annoying because this game is way too buggy and nonsensical for it to have any amount of realism or seriousness applied to it. Animals constantly try to hunt you down aggressively as if you were just covered in squirrel blood constantly + whatever the f*ck honey badgers want to eat. Birds will attack you from the sky but it doesn't matter if you can hear them coming, if you turn to shoot in time, they will seize control of your character and prevent you from shooting your gun magically from 15 feet away as the game starts up a quick time sequence way too early. Stealth is buggy and enemies often can detect you because you killed someone 50+ feet away on the other side of a building, they'll just telepathically instantly communicate to each other that the other guy died or was hit.

(Slight spoilers in this paragraph)
I thought it'd be a bit worse compared to FC5 which is the first ever FC I played and enjoyed, but jeez this one was quite annoying. I have a bad habit of being a completionist gamer. When I have so many games to play and so much other stuff in my life to do besides gaming all day, being a completionist takes up way too much time. But one good thing I can say is this game was bad enough to force even me, a habitual completionist gamer, to stop caring about collecting all the little thing-a-ma-jigs or doing side quests and just finish the damn storyline, which was also a little anticlimatic to be honest. Ending was sour-sweet but mostly sour, and going through the alternative endings it seems clear that this is one of those games where no matter what ending you get its a ""damned if you did this, damned if you did that, damned if you did nothing, damned if you did it all"" type of game, which for me personally was annoying. I mean, I f*cking conquered all of kyrat and my reward in the final epilogue cutscene is showing both of the potential golden path leaders doing horrible shit and repeating the cycles of abuse that the final boss of the game perpetuated. 

DLC was so bad I didn't even notice I completed it until I went online and realized the missions I did were the DLC. They were very cookie cutter and nothing was special about them that made them feel like an extended experience to the game.",1638662304,1640468491,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

FC3 was a great time and a character like Vaas is hard to follow, and in that aspect FC4 is disappointing. Pagan Min isn't anywhere close to as interesting as Vaas, but is still an intriguing antagonist. The Protagonist (Ajay) also isn't nearly as interesting as Jason Brody from the last game, and doesn't go through much, if any, growth throughout the campaign.

If you enjoyed Far Cry 3's gameplay, you'll love this game too. But if it's the intense exciting story of Far Cry 3 you're looking for, well, you'll only get about half of that here. This game does have excitement, but it just doesn't have the unexpected surprise elements that Far Cry 3 had. The story is more... political, which makes it feel more grounded but less exciting. 

My main complaint is that its been 7 years but Ubisoft has not fixed the issue that causes crashes in Shagri-La. I'm using a 3070 but I still have to lower the graphics to Low or else the game crashes in that area, which is a damn shame because I find it to be one of the most beautiful areas in the entire game.

We were forced to play solo through the first 3 hours of the game before getting to the point where we could even try to play coop. You're supposed to complete the first Act of the story and get to an insufferable American character whose sole purpose is to tell you that you can play coop now. Except we couldn't because it refused to register the fact that my friend had talked to the guy. It kept starting the game before that point and made him listen to that moronic cutscene 5 times, before we gave up. I'm assuming he'll have to play another mission before it works.

Thus we haven't been able to play the game for the purpose I bought it for. It's also possibly the buggiest Ubisoft game I've played, which is surprising given it's been like some 7 years since this game was released and 10 patches to it. But the list of bugs are as follows:

1. Alt-tabbing will disconnect you from the server, which will lead to the game freezing and dumping you back into the main menu, losing all the progress. Any connection issue will do the same.
2. It stutters a lot, surprising because Far Cry Primal ran completely fine. There is a guide on steam that suggested disabling mipmap loading, which did improve things but there seems to be more pop-in of assets.
3. So much asset pop-in my god
4. Skipping the intro videos via command line may not let you play online (happened to my friend but not to me).
5. No explanation of why you can't play coop. Just generic ""can't connect"" or whatever.
6. Generic mission / world bugs.

We played the first two hours at a stretch and i don't rememeber everything except the fact that we were raging by the end of it.

There are also other issues regarding the game itself. The writing is kinda bad, the dialogues especially. If you're South Asian or speak Hindi/Urdu, then you will find the dialogues almost high-school like. The writers subscribe to the philosophy that ""insults are gritty"" so you have murderous border guards saying something a 10 year old would. Moreover, the various texts written in Hindi make no sense. The loading screen will say ""KYRAT"" in english but the hindi under it says ""ek minute"" which means ""one minute"". Why? Who knows. Other loading screens are similarly weird. The in game sign boards etc are often poor transliterations from english to hindi (and maybe nepali too). Sometimes they outright just use gibberish. It's really bizarre. The asset team did a fantastic job of making the villages and buildings, but then everything else just feels lazy. There are blanket vendors in random places. Like sure you'll find a few on the roads in the region IRL but it's not like you'll find them in a forest.

Apart from that, the game really loves its torture scenes, even more than FC3 which is quite the achievement. The whole opening act is just hyperviolent assault followed by prolonged torture scenes. The open world is irritatingly densely packed with things that want to kill you, either animals or people. It completely kills any sense of exploration or freedom. There are no rhinos so far up in the mountains either. Why are there so many rhinos? Why do eagles want to kill you? It's so strange.

The mission design is more or less uninspired. The voice acting can be good but the dialogues themselves feel forced and stereotypical. Some of the animations also feel exaggerated. The cutscenes are insufferable. I have nothing really to say about the game that I like.

Do not play it. If you absolutely must play a FC then play something like FC6. Especially for coop. But it's really put me off buying any more Far Cry games. It's a real shame because Primal was actually quite good by comparison.",1640086242,1640086242,False,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

Absolutely garbage game. 
A product for consoles.

Awful storytelling is what makes this product unplayable.

Character development is non existent.

Gameplay is boring, repeptitive, clunky and bland.
Developers focused on creating meaningless activities.
The opportunity to create awesome and memorable missions is missed.

At the beginning of campaign you already have no space in your inventory, everything is locked, every aspect of gameplay feels unfinished or restricted. Is it called progression now?
Forcing you to mindlessly hunt animals to expand your inventory bag, for example.
This kind of repetitve gameplay is what they want you to experience.

Characters are boring, annoying, not memorable.

I am interested in playing through one more time after reading that it is possible for the lead character to defeat the dictator and become king (after all Kyrat needs good leadership-ahm).

If you are considering playing this game you might enjoy it if these factors appeal to you. The battle for control plot dynamics make your choices matter, and the game offers a vast, realistic looking, mountainous terrain with lots of unique items and places to discover. The texture maps still look good. Traveling through Kyrat included swimming, mountain climb, zip lines, hang gliders, aircraft, wing suits, various vehicle and motor cycle models, and, oh yes, endless running on foot, if you choose which was my favorite way to move about. Highly recommend the Yogi and Reggie quests because they are hilarious and take the player into another realm-very  entertaining and a break from conventional combat missions.

The game offers many side quests to help rescue villagers from different criminal operations. I wish that the game offered side quests to attack and shut down animal poaching operations. The game offers wonderfully and realistically designed animal species that make the wilderness seem alive. Quests to save endangered animals from Pagan Min solder's exploitation would have felt just as good as rescuing hostages or captive mine workers. Also, when a base is liberated from Pagan Min control there is often an animal trapped in a cage. I wish that I could have peacefully released it back into the wild.

The basic movement, traversal, and gunplay are all pretty solid. The graphics are pretty, but clearly dated at this point. The writing is good. The progression is pretty fun until you max out most of your abilities, which I think happened a little bit too early. The game is actually mildly difficult at some points, leading me to die a few times, which I wasn't expecting. There is quite a bit of padding and filler content in the form of collectibles and certain missions labeled ""Side quests and activities"", though these latter actually have unique dialogue attached to them, so they don't feel totally copy-and-pasted, which was nice. You can easily ignore most of the collectibles, since there isn't any real reward attached to them other than checking it off the list of the game's progression menu.

I think the game is a bit too long unless you beeline through the main quest.

If you want a review from a player to new the series and has more to say then ""lol FarCry 3 beter"" or ""rrrrRRRRrrr Uplay is dum"", here's a super concise review

Having never played one of the series before, I really enjoyed this game. like a 7.5/10

Stealth play: Fun, good diverse play, sometimes a little tedious.
Combat: Flows well, gun variety, vehicles can be a bit over powered against player(I played on Hard).
World: Beautiful! Himalayan mountain country, unique cultural setting not usually scene in games
Story: Lackluster, missed out on some opportunities to immerse the player. It drives plot as well as the auto drive system in-game works: barely.
Movement+travel: Helicopters, wingsuits, cars, large open world. Character movement is quite standard for an fps, can climb stuff too. Exploration can be quite fun at times, but also sometimes gets old 
Content+Length: a 100% run takes time, its a solid 80 hours I would predict. Game isn't very replayable unless you absolutely love it. Good mission variety for game of its kind.
Frustrations: Not many, only that the stealth weapons bow and throwing knifes inconsistently don't kill. So why advertise em for stealth if they dont work well? I gave up trying and stuck with sneaky guns quickly.
Characters:
I lied, Im not gonna be concise, I'm going to spend time talking about the characters because it bugged me. The most colorful character is Pagan, the antagonist but that's what happens when you take a bunch of normies in a room and throw in some super alt dank kid from reddit. As in, he stands out but not because hes clever or masterfully written, its cause everyone else is so boring. Also what even is the main character? Hes a total chump and I really didn't understand his reaction or lack thereof to most of the events of the game. Like despite all the death, torture, and hints that his mom is not who he thought she was, the most visible emotions he displays is anger at the Amsterdam douche-hippies upon the first drugging. P r i o r t i e s  I suppose. And the two main supporting characters, Amita and Sabal, escalate their antagonism far faster then you get to know them. Suddenly Amita goes from ""hey Im progressive"" to ""lets make opium"" and sabal is like ""saving lives is important"" to ""I wanna marry a kid"" or something. My point is that I wanted to enjoy the characters in the absence of plot but I couldn't because they didn't portray them well. I've played alot of games that successfully forsake a deep/intricate narrative by including well developed characters you learn to love or hate. This game forsakes the plot but also the characters. Sadface. And yes, I opted to take any story route that allowed more character exposition (like not shooting Pagan) but it still was disappointing. I'm told thats a FarCry thing.

Also quit posting reviews dumping on this game just cause of Uplay. Yeah I didnt like that I had to use it but its unhelpful to post nothing more than Uplay hate. Warn me of it yes, but also, hows the game?????

Farcry 4 has managed to pull me in and not let go till i finished it completely, yet i still have more and more to do which, i do very much so wanna do 

this game is an easy yes for anyone who likes shooters with big maps filled with things to go find or discover 

and i will say on my own opinion that its the last great Farcry game in the series, with its good story and the choice of sides and people, id put it higher in rating if we could join pagan or do more with other people to put even more story based missions into the game that were not for the rebels, of whom i did not enjoy being with to much, but the good times did come around at some of the points in the main story and abroad

Almost every aspect of this game is on a decent level and many things are straight up great. Of course there are plenty of repetitive side activities, but game mechanics don't make you bored while doing them. The fictional country of Kyrat is beautiful, very vertical, vast but dense at the same time, with so much content and interesting places to discover.
Stealth approach is perfectly polished, gun feeling is satisfying, with many different types of weapons to choose from.
Shangri-La's storyline is majestic with a really nice boss fight at the end, it was something fresh, something positively different, as well as parts in the Himalayas. It's hard to get bored in this game, you can always just go conquering outposts or even fortresses or go ahead and push the main storyline further.

Imo main negative aspect is character design - many of them are just cliche over the top American style weirdos like Hurk, Willis, Longinus or Yogi and Reggie. It makes me wanna puke how Ubisoft, a french company tries so hard to befriend an american player, aiming at the taste of an average gamer from across the ocean. This is very visible and looks forced as fuck. To be honest the only great character in the game is the main antagonist - Pagan Min, but at least he has something mysterious in his attitude and doesn't act like some badass homie from the average action movie.
Also some quests are stupidly designed and made me wanna punch a person who created them eg. the driver of a truck needs to be killed, but you must do that while using a buzzer (small helicopter). Why? No one knows. Things like that are just unexplainable and always been a pain in the ass in Ubisoft games. What kind of a moron is responsible for such things I would love to know.

And in case of ending {POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT}:

I killed Pagan Min and I have no regrets. To all that think he is a good guy - are you delusional? Tyrant supporting slavery and censorship, allowing his soldiers to abuse the people of Kyrat etc etc.
Amita and Sabal are not perfect but way better than this psycho. He has a charming personality, I give him that, but still I've just chosen to shoot him in the head. It's the only logical way to put away the threat that this human being is to the surrounding people.",1639076806,1639076904,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There is lots of repetitive fetch quests, collectible hunting, base capturing, and trippy drug/trance missions that are kinda boring. If you played another Farcry and liked it, you'll like this one. If you played a Farcry game and hated it, don't buy this one. Having said that, Farcry is probably the best Farcry game I've played. I'm just the level of braindead to find enjoyment in Farcry 4 so I'm giving it a thumbs up, overall 77/100. 

The Setting:
 Farcry is known for having great locations, and Kyrat is no exception, in fact I think it's my new favorite. It's basically Tibet and Nepal mashed together, and I never would have thought of it but it was a great choice. Expect a lot of climbing, long distance sniping, and flying to get around the beautiful scenery and crazy animals (the rhinos are my favorite because they just crush everything in their path causing chaos) Some missions also fly you out to the Himalayas for some snow action, and it's so much fun to snipe NPCs in the blizzard just by watching their muzzle flashes, Simo Hayha would be proud of me. Setting is easily 100/100 
The Characters:
-The Ghale Family. Your character Ajay Ghale is a sociopath. He has no personality other than the occasional ""yeah okay"" as he goes to commit warcrimes all over Kyrat. He doesn't even have training or a thirst for freedom or anything, he just... starts murdering people without hesitation. That's all there is to say about him tbh. His parents are the ones that are interesting. Ajay's father Mohan was the leader of the rebellion and has journal entries hidden around the map uncovering more about his life, Ajay's childhood, and Ajay's mother (who is also basically the Dalai Lama btw) and the rise of the main antagonist Pagan Min. This is probably the only collectible I really wanted because I liked the story of the failed rebellion.
-The Golden Path. You will be helping the southern resistance movement in Kyrat called the Golden Path, a hodgepodge of radicals both reformists and traditionalists with an impressive amount of realistic internal struggle. You decide through two leaders which path (pun intended) the Golden Path takes- will you join Sabal the Traditionalist and bring Kyrat to former glory? Will you help Amita the Reformer pull Kyrat into the future? You decide.... not that it makes a lot of difference. It would be one thing if the choice affected gameplay (like allied NPCs get a defense buff or better weapons for ex) but in the end it doesn't change much for you. I also wish the characters were better and given more screentime than just a few minutes. Great ideas here and I hope to see more internal struggle B plots like this in Rebellion type games, but poor execution as it has no bearing on gameplay.
-The Villain. Pagan Min is better than Vas, there I said it. He's more charming and has more to say, dropping little monologues here and there about how great he is, and his North Korea style propaganda is equally entertaining (even the animal descriptions circle back to how perfect yet brutal his reign has been, claiming ""There are no rats in Kyrat, anyone who reports seeing a rat will be tried for TREASON."") He also plays an important role in the backstory of the game, being the driving factor in the game's prologue with Ajay's parents, which you uncover later through journal entries. 
-The (B)h(ad)ra. Look, Kyrat is a fake country and I know why- politics doesn't sell well in *certain* countries that start with a C- but this could have been more meaningful and important had they chosen to be more bold politically. Bhadra is a girl you meet early on who is a ""spiritual leader"" to the Kyrati religion who ""reincarnates in order to carry on the faith."" for those out there who were not raised Buddhist this is the Dalai Lama by any other name, an important religious figurehead who has been in exile since the Chinese government invaded and occupied Tibet. China has since gone on a campaign to raise most of Tibet to the ground, committing some of the CCP's earliest atrocities at reeducation camps against the monks and the Tibetan way of life. It's a very dark, very sore mark for Bhuddhists and China even today, and its becoming more apparent that we need to start talking about it. Instead, the story just introduces the concept of Bhadra and her role in the Kyrati culture, and then completely ignores all of that. She barely makes any appearances outside of like, two or three missions tops. Ubisoft rather hide behind fake countries and fake religious titles to sell more games, but the way this story washes away the very real struggle between Tibet and the Chinese Communist Party is almost insulting. 
overall are the characters good? Eh there's a couple winners, but most are kinda just there to fill space. 60/100
The Gameplay: It's a Farcry game. That's it. Stealth is OP, NPCs are stupid easy unless in large numbers, and the fighting is chaotic when fire and explosions are involved. As decent as the last game, literally no changes were made . Still fun I guess but not very challenging. 70/100",1638853055,1638853055,True,30,2,0.790629684925079346,1,True,False,False

Kyrat is a colossal, dense, visually diverse place that feels lived in, torn up, and ancient. Far Cry 4 capitalizes on every available strength to make it an amazing open world for first-person action and adventure, while failing repeatedly in creating enjoyable characters within it.
Its most notable misfire is the hollow, ambivalent protagonist. Ajay Ghale, the American son of Kyrati freedom fighters, returns to his Himalayan birthplace to scatter his mother’s ashes, and becomes embroiled in his parents’ revolution. It’s a smart, human premise that justifies Ajay’s rampant warpath throughout Kyrat, but Ajay isn’t remotely as interesting as the things he does.Versatility is the greatest strength in Far Cry 4’s first-person exploration and combat. I scaled cliffs with climbing gear in search of treasure, religious monuments, and hostages in need of rescue. In venturing into the Himalayan mountains, I stole oxygen masks and snowmobiles to survive, and used the unstable environment to crush enemies with snow. Long-lost letters told a tragic story I wanted to learn more about. Collectible calling cards had me on the trail of a serial killer, and gorgeous vistas had me in awe of Kyrat’s lakes, mountains, and other spectacular scenery. This is sometimes compromised by lower-resolution textures and an inferior draw distance on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, but Far Cry 4 is comparable to Far Cry 3 in terms of visual fidelity, and up to expectations for old-generation hardware.
I loved discovering every inch of Kyrat because it always presented compelling opportunities. Liberating it from the oppressive government was always front and center; as in Far Cry 3, enemy-occupied towers serve as platforming puzzles with a fulfilling sense of personal progression. Climbing to the top gives you a broader perspective of the world, highlighting notable places and unlocking new objectives.",1638032694,1638032694,True,2,0,0.501498103141784668,0,True,False,False

The basis behind the stupid drugs and religious ideals is an interesting idea but just boring. You attack bases and they send helicopters and armoured troops which without careful planning of weapons and grenades etc is a pretty painful experience. The entire game wants you to be as stealthy as possible but doesn't help with easily planning how to enter or fight the bases. I just sniped the fortress etc in the end because it was just too frustrating to keep trying to do everything in stealth without spending another 50/100 hours in  the game learning how to master stealth and i cba with that. ok game but 6/10 overall nowhere near a masterpiece and a lot with gun play needs re working.,1637194944,1637195009,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

What am I talking about you ask, well here is a list of the tripe Ubisoft has put in and things they have taken away, combine them and FC is dead pile of elephant dung.

RPG elements, different ammo types for different enemies, camp building, down graded graphics, useless animal hunting that serves no real need other than we did it in FC3 and FC4 so lets put it in because even though we can't be arsed to included the mechanics that made it interesting, enemies not dropping weapons, rubbish antagonists with silly endings, 3rd person cut scenes, overly large maps, silly coloured guns because they are pretty, micro transactions actually in the menu when you are changing your weapons and equipment, bugs and poor performance, your character never talking, your character talking too much, companions that look cool but can't do damn all half the time, piss poor AI, no hand gliders, moronic allies that find the whole situation of danger and death a big fat joke and finally Ubisoft telling you to keep playing the fu**ing game when you stop because the bad guy is winning and if you stop we can't try and sell you anymore childish coloured skins in what is supposed to be a real world situation.

All that trash listed above is in FC5, FC New Dawn and Far Cry 6 to some degree spread across the three games, no everything is in each game hence why Ubisoft have been chipping away, its been a slow process but Ubisoft have killed the FC franchise, and just to make totally sure there is no coming back apparently  FC7 will be a live service, what joy!",1636938185,1636942990,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

1. Ubisoft Connect is a totally bitch to get working and half the time, the game just crashes. This is coming from someone with a $1600 gaming pc so it’s not my PC. It’s Ubisoft’s shit cloud server... 

2. The first 30 minutes of the game is legit Cutscenes and climbing things. You don’t actually liberate stuff until later on meaning you have to play a solid 2 / 3 hours before you can start free roaming this massive open world.

3. The proformance is not great either and this is coming from someone with a mid range gaming pc. Most of the time, it’s not your pc’s fault, unless it’s something very graphically demanding or your playing the game on ultra on the higher resolutions, so 99% of the time, it’s Ubisoft’s shit cloud server. Another problem I’m having with the game is when I try to open steam overlay, it just freezes my pc and I have to force restart my actual pc. 

I mean, it’s not horrible but it’s not great either. If you really want a good far cry for a decent price, I highly recommend you purchase Far Cry 3 as it’s more optimised and it’s cheaper as well. Unless Ubisoft fixes these proformance issues, I don’t recommend you purchase Far Cry 4 at the current time.

Ubisoft connect : piece of *******!! 

To this day the game still suffers crashes on PC port.

Music is ok.

Unskippable intro......... 

Towers are a joke compared to FC3 

You have to HUG the chests to open them......

Radio in car is ANNOYING AS ********!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  And so far no way of shutting it off.

2nd time you play the cutscenes are effing irritating!

The game is too easy.

Gyrocopter is not able to fly over certain regions although he should be able. Motor fails and chance to crash .... What the??????

Fail in main mission = frigging cutscenes all over again (unskippable) ..........

Do I recommend it? The immersion is GREAT. But that is it. Buy it in sales. WITHOUT the DLCs.  FC3 is better.

Far Cry 4 takes place in the beautiful fictional country of Kyrat (based on Nepal & Tibet) and is, especially for a game that came out in 2014, gorgeous as far as graphics go. There are light RPG elements such as crafting to improve your wallet/bag space, ammo, quivers, etc.

The story is fine. The real star is Pagan Min, the antagonist voiced by the masterful Troy Baker, whom the protagonist Ajay Ghale has a connection with through his mother. Personally, I prefer Pagan Min over Vaas from 3. The Golden Path, the rebels trying to take back Kyrat from Min, is jointly led by Amita and Sabal, both of which ask you to carry out certain objectives for them. Key thing is, though, is that outside of regular Golden Path missions, you have to choose which character's missions you'd prefer to do. Do this and that certain character will end up leading the Golden Path.

Ajay isn't as interesting as Jason Brody from Far Cry 3 mostly because unlike the third game, there's no diving into Ajay's psyche and seeing how the amount of bloodshed he commits on a daily basis affects him. 3 was a psychological journey in seeing how it fucked up Jason overtime. This is largely absent here in favor of a more focused look on a tyrannical figure who looks a bit like an asian Milo Yiannopoulos (sorry) and a massive rebel force against his rule. It works here, though, and I liked it.

As usual, gameplay is great. Stealth is great. It works. There's a ton of outposts to liberate, lots of different sidequests involving hunting and whatnot, and the gunplay is amazing. Plenty of skills to level up and, if you're interested, tons of collecting to do if you're gunning for 100% like me. A standout for me is how satisfying traversing the world feels, especially with the vehicles. End of the day, though, Far Cry 4 is just more of 3 in a different and amazing environment.

Music is cool wild as the whole game :D I remember playing first time ever and completing the game on about 89% was a years ago on ps4. There I can play better and I end up doing everything up in 50 hours. I really do reccomend this game to all of u kindness. Even kids can enyoj that. The game is really like a Rambo 2 and 3 movie playstyle stealth and rampage. There's a lots of stuff to do. Crafting ,outposts liberation and a lots of quests with different requirements that they needs to be done for example in eye for an eye quests u need to do it with weapon that game gives u and it can be a bullshit revolver. In assasination quests u need to be undetected the whole time of killing. 

+Atmosphere 
+Graphics 
+Music 
+A lots of diffrent ass wiped weapons 
+Different styles of play 
+The games not brutal so kids can play too 

-Characters pointless written even our hero
-Not sure decisions to make who to kill ( if Im honest I would like to kill Sabal and Amita together they're pointless) 
-Maybe optimalization on my definetely ready PC to FC4 I had 78fps on average there goes up to max 128 or 98 and get lower to even 48 in some reason 

To be fair that's it. The game really needs to be played by all of u who didn't buyed it. 
U can be a commando a sniper a psycho with shotgun going on heavy armor whatever. 
Buy it !

[hr][/hr]

[h1]What I liked[/h1]

[b]Story[/b]
At first, I didn't appreciate the story. It's not as awesome as the story in Far Cry 3. The first part of the story is really one-sided but I was really surprised on the plot twist at the end of the story! Great job writers!

[b]Game Play[/b]
The game play is very similar to Far Cry 3 but with a lot of improvements. There are a lot of side activities that are enjoyable and give great rewards. I also liked the addition of fortresses in the map which makes the game much challenging. There's also a 'gun for hire' which can help you liberate outposts and fortresses. The graple also made some collectibles much challenging to get which is awesome in my opinion. All and all, even thou this is like a reskin of Far Cry 3, they still made some improvements which is kinda cool.

[b]Crafting[/b]
They nailed the crafting here. Because of the improvements in the game play, syringes are much useful now. I also liked the fact that they added some challenges on Crafting special equipment. 

[b]Wallet[/b]
Unlike in previous Far Cry, money here is very useful because of the upgrades. I never experience a full wallet in this game unlike in Far Cry 3 that even at the middle of my progress I already experiencing a full wallet. I just do hope they added more upgrades similar to AC Rouge.

[b]Optimization[/b]
This game is much optimized than Far Cry 3. Playing this at a gaming laptop with i7-8750h CPU and 1050ti GPU, this game runs smoothly at high settings. I wish this use this engine on their game as well. 

[hr][/hr]

[h1]What I didn't like[/h1]

[b]Environment[/b]
I do liked the setting of Far Cry 3 more than Far Cry 4. The world here is much darker than the Far Cry 3 (darker in the sense of color palette but that's just my opinion). But I must say that they still scenery in this game great! (Just look at the number of my screenshots) The attention to details on the environment is very good. Most especially when using the buggy. But then again, I liked the setting of Far Cry 3 more. I just love beaches! By the way, you may also encounter annoying animals in here. They're really are annoying.

[b]Collectibles[/b]
As a person that has OC on cleaning things, this game pisses me off. They inserted so much collectibles in the game that 40% of my time in the game is to collect these collectibles. I just wish they lessen this one.

[b]Some side mission[/b]
There's this one mission, [spoiler]Shangri-la missions[/spoiler], that I decided not to finish. It's just annoying and I really didn't feel it. Actually there's also this one mission. It's just too hard and I think it should a coop mission instead of a single player mission.

[b]The bed[/b]
Like wtf. I never used this thru out my entire game play. Enemies are still vigilant even at night so I don't think this one has a purpose. At least on Valley of the Yetis. But I never understood why they added it in the game.

[b]Arena[/b]
Actually, I liked this at first. But it becomes boring after so many times you joined the arena. But at least you're getting a rare weapon when you reached a certain rank in the Arena. But for me, I didn't like the game play.

[b]Achievements[/b]
Available in UPlay. I just hate those online achievements that requires other players to do it. I hope they copy the achievement system in AC Origins and Odyssey.

Had some really memorable missions, and stealth made the most sense in this game as well as camps and bell towers being fun to climb. Hunting was the best because it had an actual purpose. FC6 uses scrap and crafting mechanics which is a decent alternative, and FC5 was just plain bad in that department.
On the other side of the coin, however, bell towers and camps are very repetitive. Side missions are incredibly repetitive and don't really change too much. Other than that the vehicles can be lacking in comparison to later games, but isn't much of a problem. Can't think of many more negatives. $30 may be asking too much considering its age but its definitely worth it on sale.",1635567191,1635567191,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'd like to see the day they become good again and if they could forget about their greed, that would be awesome, I really do, but I doubt that will probably ever happen.

In a few words, this should be considered as an expansion that would have been sold at 15$ at max.
The copy/paste is everywhere in this ""game"".

This game would not even have been worth 29.99$ at launch so 110$? It's pathetic.
It's unoptimized, and it's the same game as Far Cry 3, exactly the same but with reskins.
The game is just a copy/paste from Far Cry 3.
I seriously hate myself for having throw 100$ at this crap which isn't even worth 20$
Seriously, I wonder when they will be able to code something, probably never.
Don't excpect lot of content.
Expect the same amount of content that you can find in Far Cry 3, and literally the same content, just different skkins.
Same story but different skin.
Still not realistic nor challenging (well, it's Far Cry, so I guess that doesn't really matters since it's a game more about destruction and that kind of things but they could at least have made it harder on the highest difficulty)
The same ""not so good"" stealth system, it was fine for Far Cry 3, but come on now, upgrade it, do something about it.
Weapons almost all sounds the same.
AI is still as retarded as ever (pretty much like those working at Ubisoft).
They're slow, they're dumb, they will rush everything just to stab you with their weapon then run away, in lot of missions, they'll just stop coming and stay away which means you have to get to them to kill them even though they're the attackers, well done Ubisoft.

This ""game"" should have been an expansion, an expasion that would cost max 14.99$.
Now, that would have been fair and it could have been considered good.

So, in the end, it is not ""bad"", it's just the same overpriced experience as before.

If it would have been 9.99$ - 7.5/10
But I'll give it a 3.5/10 since in the end, it is just the same experience that you pay full price again, and let's be honest, even Far Cry 3 wasn't worth 110$, no game is worth that much.
The Witcher 3 was sold at 50$, that's the max, and that was a great game that deserved its price, lot of content, lot of everything, and it's beautiful at the same time.
This, no, just no.



Edit 2020: They released Far Cry 5 and New Dawn awhile ago, seriously, Ubisoft are just a bunch of worthless piece of shit at this point, ignore them, their games aren't worth crap anyway, and if you really want to play them, do whatever you want but do not give them your money, they do not deserve any of it, let it die already, Ubisoft doesn't deserve to even exist.

I was looking to try a new experience in this game with a friend who got it on sale. After we got set up we went to download to map editor from the game and that's where things went wrong. After we successfully installed the editor and went to launch Far Cry 4, we were met with the pre-loading screen and then it would close. Many fixes didn't work like running as administrator, uninstalling u-play launcher, verifying game files and more. This is on the game's behalf and it seems like other people are getting similar issues too. 

Edit: Going to try to fix this soon...

The AI is so dumb, and after so many FC games it is really weird the same problems are still there. You frequently get things like rebels running up to soldiers shouting at them while they get shot. Road accidents or sudden convoys happen all the time. I was run over and killed by an allied boat while stopping my boat to fish. I respawned, travelled back to the area and shot the pilot in the head and the other person in the boat didn't seem to care.

Also, rhinos like to enter gunfights I discovered (and i am not talking about one released from a cage).

You cannot save on certain missions, which means if RL gets in the way you are abandoning progress.

The random encounters are just too many and too similar. It is boring.

Once I freed an outpost I got told three times in a row that i could now co-op, but i had to sit through a cutscene first with another dumb stereotype character. Felt like EA with their 'only the online experience matters'.

The plot is so contrived as are all the characters and you have to sit through unskippable cut scenes about people you do not care about but act like you are either the saviour or the rookie deserving of contempt. The writing is on the level of the worst of Disney, pitching me as some sort of chosen one as fast as possible (though with a brief disbelieving moment from the hot girl).

The illusion of choice is so bad in this game and the way it is presented... 'you will now get to choose between X and Y. This will impact your missions'. wow, ok well what if i don't choose X or Y? oh, nothing like that in the game huh? I wanted to join the evil side 5 minutes after meeting these people, or more correctly I wanted to shoot all of them!

Then i wandered to the safe room in the outpost to refill my ammo - oh, left mission area by just crossing to another building and the mission restarted with all the same cut scenes. I quit the game at that point.
