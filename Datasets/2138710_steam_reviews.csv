But eventually, as you go back to prior levels to try to beat them with fewer deaths (so you'll have more to spare later), you'll notice that you ARE improving at the game. Until eventually, you have that Matrix moment of ""I know kung fu"" and start to clear levels with no deaths at all.

And then the game will throw a new challenge at you and taunt you with it.  And when you overcome it, a new one will stand in your way, with one in particular taking away your most powerful crutch and telling you ""Nah, you want to finish the game?  Do it for real.  No cheap tricks.""

while the core game is great and provides a lot of realism (sometimes), I genuinely cannot recommend it like this whatsoever. In terms of defence, it is slightly ridiculous the timing for some of the blocks (for the more OP superhuman mfs mostly), and the speed some characters throwing punches/kicks and movement is fucking hilarious. At first, when fighting the more basic characters even the difficult ones are fun to go against. But what completely killed it was when i started to get hit by unrealistic combos that you LITERALLY cannot avoid even if your thumb is robotic.

Most of this game consists of memorizing enemy's attack instead of reacting/forcing an enemy to behave a certain way. What do I mean by this?  Well, you get barely any feed back from your actions. The difference between a perfectly parried attack and a parried attack are almost unnoticeable. Same with the difference between a perfect dodge and a failed dodge, only feed back you get is that your ""Structure"" bar hasn't filled up. The non existent enemy attack telegraphing is also not doing this game any favors. Sure you might get more satisfaction from finally be able to (sometimes) dodge their attacks, it is not what most people expect from the trailers and marketing.

Your attacks are not really attacks, it's more like initiating a section of a rhythm game and use combo. I've hit the guy like 4 times, he is staggered, I should move in and finish him off right? Nope! He snaps back to his combo instantly because he hasn't finished all the attacks in that combo. You have to WAIT till he finishes his combo, no matter if you spin kick him in the face, chain punch him in the throat or jab him with a machete, he WILL not care until he finishes his combo!

Your actions do so much less than in other fighting games, you never truly feel the impacts of your hits. As a person who's trained in martial arts and had to use it in real life, I can tell you with confidence that people do not recover from a lot of the attacks you do in the game that easily. You can NOT approach this game with the mentality of a fighting game, it is NOT.

If you like stylish kongfu dance-off that expects you to grind through the same few areas again and again and again whith barely sufficient guidance as to how most of the game mechanics work to memorize the ridiculously short/unclear dodge windows, go ahead, You'll love this one.

This isn't ""Dark Souls hard"" or ""combos in fighting games hard,"" but an odd mix of both of those things at about half power each. Me, I like both of those kinds of challenges, so I think this game's the s**t. 5 out of 5 for me. But if you get frustrated easily or don't like focusing on improving at a game, this might not be the one. I've never booted up Sifu thinking I was about to have a lil chill sesh, I boot it up to sweat my way through some sick fistfights and hard as f**k boss battles. Be self-aware going in.

If you're still down, the story is honestly the only real major stumble here, it's somewhat lacking in delivery. As cool as the age/death system is, they also don't do a great way of conveying how it works in regards to level-to-level progression, or that you can basically ""start over"" by selecting The Squats at the stage select. Neither of those things is going to get in the way of what you're here for, though. The fighting is fantastic, the progression is steady, and the animations are captivating. Finishing this game keeping your character in their 20's provides a real sense of accomplishment that few other games can provide, and it's very possible.

BE ADVISED: Permanent unlocks are key. Don't worry about decking out your skill tree every run. Pick 2 or 3 skills to go in on at a time and work on not only unlocking them but actually using them consistently. This will help you learn. You're not going to beat the game on your first run, or your fifth one, or maybe even your tenth one. Trust the process.

Things I liked : 
The animations are great, I love how fast yet impactful they are.
The sounds go well with them, none of the punches are some obnoxiously loud ""THUMP"" but they definitely have a felt impact.
Gameplay is great, its very skill oriented and tough but every encounter is possible, you have quite a few combos to use and unlock that enhance the gameplay and opportunities you can create.

Thing that were meh :
Mainly just performance, I don't have a bad rig for the time of this game's release (though by time of this review its definitely outdated.) and I still get random lag spikes which can cause me to take hits and even deaths in gameplay, the game also seems to have more of an issue if you swap levels, maybe something to do with the resource caching, that causes even more lag which has forced me to relaunch the game before.

Thing I didn't like :
The Camera is manageable but holy shit, this goes out to ANY game dev making a melee combat thing like this. Please for the love of god, let the camera go and see through walls during combat. The amount of times I got put into a corner during blocking and the camera just zooms in and looks left or right, making knowing what the enemy doing impossible is too much.

This review will contain some story spoilers, mostly talking about the beginning of the game and a LOT of gameplay spoilers.

Sifu is a 3rd person brawler/beat 'em up game with a lot of mechanics borrowed from other games and implemented very well, your objective is to go through each level defeating all sorts of enemies with different attack patterns and statistics. You start off by playing as the villain in the game as you go through your former martial arts school, with his henchmen defeating any person that gets in the way until at last you face your former sifu. You defeat and kill him and that's when the game introduces the main character of this game by making you choose as a boy or a girl. One of the main villain's henchmen kills you but since you were holding a special powerful pendant, you come back to life. Main character then trains hard for 8 whole years with revenge in his mind (I'm gonna call the main character ""Him"" because that's what I chose, but you can be a man or a woman at will and change whenever you desire).

So the game has very complex mechanics and the gameplay seems simple at first until you dwelve deep into it, let's start by separating them: You have your classic light attacks and heavy attacks which you can combine to perform different combos, some skills require to hold said button or make a pause before pressing it again to perform a different skill. You have a Focus bar which let's you perform specific powerful attacks that cannot be avoided or interrupted and you have a Structure bar that works almost exactly as the Posture bar in Sekiro where if it's filled because you got attacked a lot before you could recovered it, you get stunned and vulnerable, enemies also have a structure bar and when you break them, they are vulnerable to a takedown which is free and will (almost always, depending on the enemy) defeat them. You gain back health by defeating enemies. There are 4 ways you can avoid damage in the game and each of them have their own purpose and risk: Dodge, Avoid, Parry and Block.

Dodge: By pressing the dodge button, main character does a dash in the direction you're going, it's a great way to avoid damage and creating space between your enemies but doesn't give you any benefit in exchange other than: You didn't get hit.

Avoid: By holding the Block button and then moving up, down, left or right you can avoid a specific attack depending on where is the enemy is attacking you and if you done it successfully, you will gain Focus, regain Structure and the enemy attack slows down just enough time to give you a chance to counter attack. Much better way to deal with enemies than just dodging because it rewards you for the risk.

Parry: By tapping the Block button just before you get hit you can parry the enemy attack and depending what attack it is you can leave your opponent vulnerable and it eats their Structure. Parrying also leads to specific skills or combos you can perform, it also prevents all damage from being taken. The risk of parrying is doing it too much will build up your own Structure.

Block: By just holding the Block button will block all damage from being taken that is not dealt by a weapon, a weapon will only deal reduced damage if you happen to block it instead of parrying it. I do not recommend blocking in any instance of the game whatsoever, I think it's better to practice parrying and avoiding better. Blocking eats your structure like crazy very easily and does not consume the opponent's.

There are occasions where the enemy might do a powerful attack which can be identified by both a sound cue and orange colour coming out of their arm or leg when they do it. These attacks can be blocked or parried, blocking will almost always result in your structure being broken and parrying will result in your structure being consumed a bit, depending on the attack. Enemies can also be stunned which also are identified with a sound cue and a visual cue. Alright so by knowing all that you begin to experiment all those attacks and ways of countering your enemies and they are dealt with differently depending, but all enemies have their own patterns and they stick to them. This is a hard game at it's core, but it's extremely fair.

So the game has this very strange but very well made mechanic about what happens when you die that is hard to understand at first but after a bit, it makes sense. You start the game at the age of 20, whenever you die the game gives you a chance to spend your XP points on skills and also an opportunity to revive at a cost of you getting older, so if you die at 20, you will revive by turning 21 and increasing the death counter by 1. Depending on the Death Counter, you will age by that number each time you decide to revive, you can decrease that number by defeating specific strong enemies and by defeating bosses and boss phases. When you buy a skill, you keep it until you decide to restart the level or go back to a previous one (when you restart a level or go back, you start said level with the youngest age you arrived at), every time you age by 10 years (20, 30, 40, etc.) you get a boost of damage and a nerf in health right up until you are at least 70 years old, whenever you turn at least that age, your pendant breaks and you cannot revive anymore, forcing you to restart if you die again. Whenever you do restart a level you lose all your skills unless you previously Permanently Unlocked them which you can do by buying said skill a total of 5 times.

All levels also have 3 shrines you can interact with that heal you completely and you can get 1 shrine ability each. These shrines' requirement depend on: Requiring to be at least a certain age, have a least X amount of points in the current level or spending XP points. Unlike the skills you get from spending XP, you cannot keep the shrine abilities if you decide to back to a previous level or restart the current one. You can only keep them if you move on to the next.

The game also has these collectibles and keys you can gather by exploring the levels that motivate you to go back to previous ones to uncover more of the lore and unlock shortcuts. Every level in the game is uniquely distinct from each other in a very beautiful artistic way, same with the bosses which are all very fun and challenging to fight, they will definitely test everything you learn. The game also has 3 difficulties which vary in how much health you have, how much damage you deal and how aggressive enemies are, I personally chose Master (hard) difficulty and absolutely recommend it if you want a challenge. Also this game has a bunch of martial arts movie references if you're into that.

This game does something not a lot of games do well which is motivate me to become better at it and master it, which I can say I am close to doing so after already beating it without dying once on Master difficulty and getting all 3 stamps in every single Arena. Arenas are specific challenges separate from the story mode that vary in objectives and they are a lot of fun, specially after the last update that added a bunch of them, definitely making the game highly replayable.

This game went from one of the hardest challenges I ever done to being my comfort game that I play every once in a while after mastering it. I recommend anyone giving it a chance, if you're struggling be patient, be determined and learn from your mistakes, that's how you beat this game and it feels great.

The game looks beautiful, and there were so many moments throughout that made my jaw drop. This game is a work of art.

Thankfully, the polish doesn't end in the environments, as the gameplay is top-tier as well. You will feel like an action hero, and your own skill will determine which hero you're playing: from the one who barely makes it out alive, to the unbelievably powerful who never takes a hit. You'll feel like the game got easier, until you mistime a single attack or meet a new enemy, and become humbled once again.

Good, but it feels like a demo. 
Not recommended for full price. 
It was an Epic Games Store exclusive for a year. 

What's in the game is of high quality, made by people who clearly understand their craft, however there's not enough worthwhile content. It feels too short and some design choices were seemingly only made to extend the length of the game, ergo waste the player's time.  

The story is way too short, with no real characters or stakes or a satisfying conclusion, not enough levels, too few weapons and lack of enemy types or interesting situations/encounters. Not enough outfits, but even the ones that are in the game are being sold for real money and then you still have to complete the entire game to unlock the challenges just to even be able even see how to obtain them. It's a terrible design, existing only to get more money out of players for something that should have been part of the base game, while also artificially extending the length of the game by locking said outfits behind challenges. Wasting both a player's time and money too. 


Why do I still recommend it on a discount?

You will have to dodge, backstep, sidestep, forward step, jump, and parry to avoid certain attacks, all while trying to weave in your own most devastating attacks and combos. The game will force you to learn to the play it through the bosses. Once you learn them you can certainly be incredibly aggressive, but they require you to know when and how to avoid attacks, and when to strike.

I unfortunately thought that the arenas were rather repetitive, and would have much preferred more levels to play through. I unlocked the first few arenas, then got bored.

Quite tough, but I liked the progression system. Felt quite clever and fresh. Coming back to perfect things I had beaten to lengthen my opportunities in later levels was something i found satisfying.

I really like most of the narrative but certain elements seem a bit under-communicated. I liked the characters and arcs, including my own as I realized how to navigate the game and the tone of the whole experience came into alignment. Was extremely satisfied with the plot's relationship with combat. I don't however, know what any of the villains were actually doing? 
[spoiler]
Either there was some subtext that was lost on me or the hinting was so vague as to be insubstantial for me to form any idea as to what drove my own character other than revenge. Each of the villains seemed to be doing mostly, nothing? But there's a hint they ARE doing something? Even by accident? Was unclear to me, but I liked them anyway.

A lot of people were put off by this game around the time it came out due to the difficulty, but Sifu's ace up its sleeve is that it's designed around that difficulty. Expect to be beaten down and age up over and over, but that's part of the learning curve, so don't feel bad if you suck, everyone does at first. This game makes you work for the power fantasy, and you feel like a badass when you nail it down. Along the way, you get new tools in the form of different moves or stat bonuses from shrines, which add to the variety. My only complaints are that I would've liked to see more enemy types and the stutter when you traverse to a new section can be a little jarring, but overall the game runs great, since it happens just when you load a new area.

It teaches you to become better. You fail, you learn. You miss, you see the consequences. It is not about who is perfect but who is the strongest. Those who leave are weak, those who stay and learn may find their strength.

Sifu is a game where balance and knowledge is the key to success, and of course, in real life too. You start up as a young person who knows how to move and attack. Yet, you feel weak due to lack of knowledge. You define your playstyle in your first moments. Then you see if it works or not. If it doesn't work, you have to change and find another way to complete each fight. 

Not only that, you have to bring a balance between being aggresive and defensive. What makes Sifu different from any other game is that no matter where you come from, you are destinated to fail. However, effort, resilience and dedication is what makes each gamer face. You are a gamer that doesn't respect your enemy, don't worry there will be another game that will give you that feeling. In Sifu, you are not Neo, you are a dude with human strength and movement. Knowing your limits is key, so, you realise what might go good or wrong.

In conclusion, it's a 10/10 game where it's more about knowledge and stress rather than jump-in kill everyone. Same as real life, you want to success? Great, respect each decision and respect others so you can have a gap to win.

The game is difficult; at the time of writing, I still have yet to beat the last boss. I have been spending time in the Arenas DLC practicing my fighting skills. Like the game itself, over time, you feel yourself getting stronger. Knowing your arsenal of moves to pair together is a rewarding experience. Over time, you will learn enemy movesets, how to parry/dodge efficiently, and how to hold your ground in a crowd of 10+. This game keeps me on my toes consistently, and when I'm not playing this game, I often think about the next time I will be playing.

Took under 20 hours to complete the full mission, including completing the board, including ""secret"" ending, on easy mode. Skills acquired carry over to ""medium"" mode so it constantly feels like you're growing as a character and building on your failures.
The story is a classic revenge plot. I normally skip all dialogue in games, because I don't care about the plot and they're usually drawn out and boring, but I found myself actually watching all the cutscenes.

Definitely worth full price, especially if you like the difficulty challenges of Souls-like games where you have to learn enemy types and movesets to be successful. Plenty of hidden features, content, and challenges, for longer replayability. The average player could easily spend 20 - 30 hours in this game; the completionist types, and challenge seekers, can easily spend upwards of 100+.

The music is insanely immersive, pretty and badass. The graphics/art style are beautiful. Like, they use colour in a second way to the second spiderverse movie does, where like, certain bosses have themes, mini bosses the lighting will change. All really good stuff. The story is pretty run of the mill revenge story but it is done well.

HOWEVER

Easy mode is too easy and ""normal"" is significantly harder. I haven't even tried hard mode yet. Its kinda like dark souls except I can't hate it (or myself) cause its so damn beautiful in every other way, Much like dark souls though, once you learn stuff rather than frantically button mash it gets easier, definitely learn how to dodge, if you don't wanna be a decrepit old man by the end of the game, learn. to. dodge. 

My one nitpick is there's one area in the club, before the mini boss with the lady on the bridge above you - its SO DARK, even when I cranked the brightness. I honestly thought, and have more than once that my game had crashed during the load screen.

The parry window is definitely a bit tight and the bots attack in different rotations with the same attack patterns so fighting large groups is nearly impossible to beat without dying a few times. It might be better with a controller over mouse and keyboard due to it being easier. Overall it can be fun with practice but the large groups and bosses will definitely keep you on your toes. I think a controller will save your keyboard from rage induced/confused key mashing.

The skill floor is very obtainable and the skill ceeling is so high that there's always room to improve. While I still maintain that the Disciple difficulty is the most balanced one I do appriciate the master a lot, really made me work on structure management and tight parries.

In terms of overal difficulty I would say it isn't very harsh game...unless you're playing on master at which point the game will kick you in the balls and throw you out the door... but you are almost certain to go back inside for another round.

The arena challenges provide tons of additional content that's bound to keep you entertained.

The basic moveset is very nice and flexible and the alternative movesets and just alternative moves are a very welcomed change of pace if you feel bored with the original. Come to think of it all the random modifiers are pretty fun to mess around with.

One mild point of critisism is that sometimes you can encounter very strange bugs. Such as getting stuck on piece of geometry next to a wall and if the enemies send you flying you'll hit the wall at termial velocity killing you instantly. Also it is sad you cannot make the enemies go into supercharged mode or carry weapons in the training room, it would help out bunch to figure out the timings on them.

I would very much like to see Sifu 2 one day. Perhaps expand the weapon roster, enemy variablity or shrine rewards where some rewards are just way too useless to pick them once you figure out which are important.",1706385717,1706385717,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

They were so close to something great, but they ruined it with awful boss fights that entirely break up the fun with misery, and honestly just boredom. The group fights actually rule but the bosses aren't just ""git gud scrub"" difficult. They entirely break the rules of the game itself. You can smack them over the head with a baseball bat and it just doesn't matter, they're still going to keep their combo going. They don't feel good to fight because even blows that land still don't even feel like you did anything.

The first phase of the third boss is particularly egregious. She does circular swings with a bladed weapon, so you can't even reliably block them. She has an attack with no recourse and it will almost entirely continue until you get hit. Yes you can parry it but you'll have to parry between 3 and 6 blows as it continues long after you decide to face it.. If you run away, she can chase you at the exact speed of your sprint.

The final boss has an unacceptably stupid caveat. Your focus attacks, which you may have thus far structured your entire build around, just don't work. The game gives you a tool, encourages you to rely on it, and then takes it away for the final fight. It's not fun. It's not good game design. It's just miserable, slow, and boring. There's really nothing interesting or fun about the last fight which kind of makes it the worst of all. You can literally just brute force it by running in, light attack to provoke, then spam block, and then once his string of attacks is done then go back and light attack again. Thankfully you don't have to perfect Yang, so you can kind of just brute force this technique. Because he does more unparryable attacks in his second phase, you'll take more damage but as long as you went in young enough it's easy. I went in at 34 and finished him at 61 and didn't have any fun and didn't feel like I learned a thing.

Because the structure of this game ensures that you have to replay levels to near perfection, I've had to beat the worst bosses a dozen times. It wasn't fun once. Unlike soulslike bosses, who are actually very fun once you figure out how to fight them. This game forces you to replay levels whether you find them fun or not and in fact, the less fun you find it, the more you're going to have to play that level. The levels themselves are very fun, but you only really do them each once because you'll eventually get a shortcut that makes them much shorter and you run almost straight to the boss, at which point you start grinding.

The structure of the game ensures that you will spend the most time miserable repeating the least fun activities it has to offer.

If you're seeking punishment that feels arbitrary, this is the game for you. If you're looking for something that feels fun to get good at, this just isn't worth it in comparison to other brutal games that feel good to play. The combat here is excellent, but it's so simple that the only way to make it difficult is to introduce enemies that go outside of how the combat is supposed to work. That's a fake difficulty.

I also failed to mention the performance issues. I like the aesthetic of the game, but it is low poly and should be able to run on a PS2. Instead, it actually stutters quite a bit on my 5800x/3080 gaming PC. I originally experienced these stutters on my Steam Deck so I figured it was just a little bit poorly optimized but it obviously has something pretty wrong.",1705451438,1705457512,False,14,4,0.491772115230560303,0,True,False,False

The boss fights are pretty ridiculous not going to lie. They always have weapons with tons of range and damage while you don't even get a weapon, which isn't a bad thing, but it's not difficult just annoying, especially because all the fights I've done have felt the same. And the easiest difficulty doesn't help you grasp dodging or parrying at all, the timings are a few frames especially with level three four and five. Trying to dodge a boss combo becomes impossible for a new player. I do not recommend if you cannot keep a cool head.

My only complaint is that I wish there was more. The story is pretty simple, so I wouldn't recommend going into this expecting deep lore and plot twists. What is there works, but that is it. 
There are only 5 levels that you will continously and repeatedly go at + an arena mode. The format works well for its intended purposes but I can't say that variety in enemy movesets issue is hard to notice after numerous runs.

You take the role of a nameless protagonist on a mission of revenge through 5 excellent missions as you hunt down the killers responsible for your fathers death. The moment to moment gameplay here is superb. It shares a lot of DNA with many other beat 'em up games, typically invoking the names of the Batman: Arkham series or the more recent Spider-Man game. It improves upon that formula, though, with a slightly more involved dodge system, an excellent set of combos, and stamina/posture breaking mechanics. Those new additions coupled with fantastic animations and combat encounters that severely punish mistakes creates a very satisfying gameplay loop that feels fresh through the 10-15 hour runtime.

It is a fairly difficult game, but not unmanageable. The previously mentioned rogue-lite-ish mechanics do a good job of providing meaningful progression throughout difficult runs.

I love it when incompetent devs take the easy route and just pretend like they're a souls-like. 
The word souls-like has been nothing but a cancer for video games. 

Sick concept, typical lazy numb-brained execution as always. God forbid you're rewarded for your problem-solving skills and decent practice. I get it, it's a fighting game, you gotta learn combos, figure out block timers - none of this is something that requires 100s of hours of practice; more like 5 at most if you really put your mind to it. Nah, you gotta quit your job and hope and pray the game has decided that on this day, when the moon is situated at the right latitude to Jupiter, you will be given +0.000004910% chance of success. And even that's not enough. 
Is getting frustrated and wasting your time really a selling feature now? You know how many REAL WORLD skills you can learn if you spent the hours you spend figuring this broken game out on learning said real skills!?

You're a fighting game Sifu, that means it's all muscle memory, not ""figure out our broken game for exploits that we call features because we're a bunch of goons"", not ""sorry, your block doesn't count this time cuz durr hurr"" or ""nah, his high attack was actually a low attack because the 72nd frame of the 100 frames in that animation was a low attack - gotta pay attention!"".

Between enemy comp, modifiers, the elite enemies that cant be environment broke when that's the only way to damage them and can't be kicked into a wall cause of their stagger limit and no items to use, that mixed with enemies being kicked through walls or closed doors and being kicked off platforms to land on a rail 20 ft down and you need to reset now adds a level of frustrating to the already frustrating arena challenges that some devil himself thought up. I experienced no problems in the main game maybe I got lucky but tons of problems in the challenge mode. Also the whole earning money from challenge modes that allows you to remove and add modifiers but doesn't keep score or anything just doesn't seem well thought out, totally should have allowed us to remove/replace some mods that keep score still or something like removing just one or lowering the age slightly, anything.... Grinding money for something that feels pointless is not great. I am almost done with getting the costumes and don't think I will touch the arena again.

This game is truly a masterpiece. As a Mandarin Translator and Cantonese Learner, one thing i really enjoy is the overall voice acting of the game. It reminds me of old kung fu movies that were overly serious, to the point it was slightly cheesy. It really captured the essence of legendary movies like IP man, Enter The Dragon etc..
 
It's quite short and to the point but you never lose sight of the goal...VENGEANCE!!

There were times in the game where I genuinely wanted to give up , but at times I couldn't help but look around and think ""Wow this game is truly Beautiful."" That alone kept me roped in. 
 I might be biased toward games like these because I love Team Ninja, and From Software games. Even in this case Sloclap does a bang up job at making you feel like a bad ass once you get the hang of the combat. 

If you're on the cusp buying this game...please give it a chance, However give yourself some grace and understand that THE CORE MECHANIC OF THE GAME IS FOCUSED AROUND DYING! Allow yourself to get acquainted with the mechanics and USE THE TRAINING EXERCISE. Just like real world martial arts, one must work tirelessly with the an unwavering attention to detail, because only then will you get the opportunity to showcase your skills and emerge triumphant. 

It goes without saying that this game is truly my new favorite game ever. Thank you for taking the time to read this review, this will likely be my first and last review as I will be playing this game for the rest of time.

Soon you will find yourself toying with bosses that ruined your night before.  The first major wall is the boss of the third level (and the enemies near the end of the level in general).  This boss felt so unfair at first and like I would never be able to do it.  After dying a few times and finally killing her I spent some time in training mode against her and really dialed in her patterns.

When I go through the level she is now almost the easiest part compared to some of the elite minions and it's honestly so fun to man handle this boss that at first felt impossible.  

For old heads, this game gives me Bushido Blade 2 vibes a bit.  Memories of the 100 ninja challenge come to mind.

It's too difficult for the sake of being didifult.
I didn't like the progression system.
It's to late to refund.
Had to use cheating to just finish the game. 
As many state, by playing this game and this game alone for 150+ hours, maybe I could have finished it under 50, but I really don't want to sink that much into this game. It's good and it's fun, but it's not a ""I could play for ever"" game.
The controls are not the best, the combos don't work most of the time because the enemies block your attacks, even if in a single hit to the head would stun then enough to do all the combo flow like in movies.
Again, the progression is bad, You just unlock combos that 90% of them you don't use. You don't improve your character per se. The only way to ""improve your character is by dying. And it comes with a downside, more damage, less life.
Even in normal, you get killed like by 3 hits, it's really punishing.
Again, if you want to sink 105+ hours into this game, you do you. 
I just wanted to finish it and uninstall it, thus I used cheating. And i feel bad, because I will skew the achievements.

I hope, if they do a second game, they do it less punishing. It's a videogame, it's for a player to unwind, to feel the fantasy of a shaolin master. Not to get frustrated as hell.
Not saying that they should make it easy as hell, but at least balance the difficulty, progression and mechanics more. 

Spoiler alert, the bosses final form, the only way to defeat it is by cheesing him..... so, have a thought about that, about how balanced the mechanics of this game are bad.

From the moment I stepped into the shoes of the protagonist, I was hooked by the game's unique blend of traditional kung fu and modern gaming elements.

The combat system in Sifu is nothing short of phenomenal. Every punch, kick, and block feels incredibly responsive and fluid, allowing players to string together complex combinations with ease. The learning curve is steep, but mastering the art of combat is an immensely satisfying experience. Each encounter feels like a dance, where timing and precision are key to overcoming challenging foes.

The aging mechanic adds an intriguing layer to the gameplay. Instead of the typical respawn system, death results in the protagonist aging, making each life lost a valuable lesson. This unique twist adds a sense of urgency and consequence, making every encounter a high-stakes battle.

Visually, Sifu is a work of art. The environments are richly detailed, capturing the essence of various martial arts schools and urban settings. The character models and animations are top-notch, immersing players in a world that feels both authentic and stylized.

The narrative is compelling, weaving a tale of revenge, redemption, and the consequences of one's actions. The character development is well-executed, and the story unfolds organically as you progress through the game. The emotional depth of the narrative enhances the overall experience, making it more than just a showcase of impressive combat mechanics.

Sifu is not without its challenges, and some may find the difficulty level demanding. However, for those willing to invest the time and effort, the rewards are well worth it. The sense of accomplishment that comes from mastering the intricate combat system and overcoming formidable adversaries is unmatched.

In conclusion, Sifu is a true gem in the world of martial arts gaming. It successfully combines stunning visuals, engaging storytelling, and a revolutionary combat system to deliver an unforgettable experience. If you're a fan of challenging games with deep combat mechanics and a compelling narrative, Sifu is a must-play that will leave you craving for more.",1704461289,1704461289,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you have nothing to do with 100+ hours of your life and you wanna get good at something you could play this, or alternatively you could pick an actual real world skill to practise and consider how far along you'd be with that in 100 hours. How good would you be at drawing after 100 hours? How good would you be at guitar after 100 hours? It feels bad to have to sink so much time into a skill that is useful for this one game, and you will eventually stop playing it.

I'm enjoying it, but I think I have to stop playing. It's just too chaotic. There's no real way to consistently play this game flawlessly without cheesing. The enemy attack patterns can be a total 50/50 a lot of the time where if their combos are going to continue or stop completely, or attack high/low. Being surrounded is difficult, and while not impossible it will take 25+ hours to sink into the game to actually master getting out of that relatively unscathed, and that's just for being surrounded with the basic gangster enemies. There's no real way to evolve into the extended combos that you want to do as well. I think of other games like Mortal Kombat and Devil May Cry which tend to have pop-up abilties to extend your combos and it's a lot of fun, but here if you're not just cheesing and pushing enemies against a wall repeatedly then they will automatically start blocking your strings, or even parry them automatically at end of a string leaving to wide open.

While I have had a lot of fun, ultimately my problem with this game is the same problem I have with Souls-like games. Patterns are purposefully hard to read and master as an artificial way to extend game play. That mixed with the 50/50s on opponent combos just leaves you feeling unsatisfied in the end. You can't perform long combos. You just have to take small digs at opponents before being forced to go back into blocking cos you know they're about to automatically block you instead. So your options are to take 1 punch and push the enemy into a wall, and do that on repeat until you can executed them, or if there is no wall you can take 1 punch and trip them up and then beat them on the floor and repeat that again and again, or you can wait to block/dodge an opponent precisely and do a string with maybe 2-6 more attacks, which include trips and wall pushing anyway. So you're not doing anything unique.

There's a lot of things about the UI that are irritating as hell as well. You can't just exit back to your home base from inside the game. You have to give up on the current mission and then that returns you to the level menu and then you have to go back to the home base from the level menu, taking you through 3 different load screens. I don't understand why you can just jump from in-game back to the base if you wanna go into the training.
Similarly, if you die the age system is a good idea, but there is no ""restart at last checkpoint"" option even though each level has 3 checkpoints. You can actually just ""give up"" and exit the level and go back to the title screen and then load the level again and you'll pick up from a checkpoint without your age being damaged, so the ability to restart from checkpoints exists in the game but is not an actual option when you die. This prevents you from practising stages of a level. If you wanna ""perfect"" a level, you gotta restart allllll the way from the beginning again unless you wanna exit your current level after dying, go to the title screen, and then start the level again. Which includes 3 different load screens. This is a huge time sink.

The training mode is way too bare bones. I think it was very hastily thrown together in code. Training mode just pits you against 1-3 enemies of a certain type and they have no ""structure bar"" (which lets you 'exhaust' your opponents in a way before doing something bigger, like executing), and they recover much faster than normal enemies. So you can't really practise your comboing. You can only practise dodging and slipping in a couple shots. And even that is frustrating as i mentioned before cos a lot the enemy combo strings are 50/50s. So you're oftening just guessing ""is this the end of the string?"" or do you dodge up or down and get it wrong and get punished?

So sadly there is no real way to ""master"" this game. You'll find playthroughs online of people doing ""no hit"" runs, but they have to cheese the hell out of it with the abuse by pushing opponents into a wall. And the game is lacking some polish in terms of user-friendliness, which is desperately needed. Developers absolutely shouldn't overlook small things like improved training options or navigating through parts of the menu system quickly.",1704449482,1704449482,False,3,0,0.428498983383178711,0,True,False,False

now that i have the steam release, i can confidently say it's a good game despite it's difficulty.

i might set it to easy to enjoy the gameplay but one thing i will say about the difficulty is that perhaps it might be artificial?
i've enjoyed a many arcade games including beat 'em up arcade games and the difficulty here is similar. the difficulty especially gets ramped up when you have to fight the camera, but that's more a fundamental problem with most beat em ups in general and it's hard to get right for devs of these types of games. it should also be said this game only has 5 levels so maybe they were... compensating...?

not to say there's anything wrong with having high difficulty, it's a big appeal to this game especially in the challenge runs or speedruns of this game. though i really wish they could do more with their games. sloclap isn't a stranger to wasted potential though (see absolver for details). the story here could've been a lot more outside of collectibles and spoken dialog, except we really just get sort of a simple revenge plot with some hand wave-y moral meaning depending on your ending. the bosses are really hyped up but yet their backgrounds are only speculated.

overall, an amazing beat em' up full of artistic value and passion hindered only by it's limited scope.

The age based system is an interesting twist, the graphics fit this style, and the switching between over the shoulder cam and side-scroller is a nice touch. Level design is also balanced, with fighting, obstacles to climb and jump, and puzzles and clues to solve and collect. There is a skill tree to master, and a few other basic ways to upgrade your character, nothing to deep so it doesn't distract from the game play. The story is typical Shaw Brothers style martial arts revenge tale, which fits this style and meshes with the game. It's also a good length, not long and drawn out, but the large levels make up for that.  Besides being really difficult, even on the newly added easier settings it's a fun and satisfying challenge.

Visually, it's a grand achievement. Mechanically, it's flawless. It feels SO GOOD to play this game, to run through stages clowning on guards.

Despite being told much in advance, it exceeded my expectations anyway. Sloclap really knocked it out of the park on this one. 

I only have one complaint, and it's something that unfortunately does kind of kill the game for me after getting as far in as I am: after beating the game, you unlock [spoiler]a whole bunch of special conditions and cool unlockable gameplay things that add a ton of variety to what is available in the game and are SUPER fun in a huge way.[/spoiler]

I have a very direct, simple, but severe complaint about that system: [spoiler]actually USING any of these fun unlockables disables the ability to earn any more; you can't complete challenges or earn points from runs made with any of them active, including slight moveset tweaks that are 99% of the fun of those options. I was so excited to see I could make a move deck again like in Absolver or God Hand only to have my hopes crushed when I realized that actually doing so disables the ability to unlock anything else, which kind of undermines the point of playing at all for me. I want to do repeat runs to unlock more stuff, put up a higher score, not just for the sake of doing them at all.[/spoiler]

If anyone knows of any mod/etc. that fixes this, I would greatly appreciate it. As-is, the game is still amazing despite this one complaint. I highly recommend it. If you enjoy martial arts movie-styled gameplay you're going to love this game.

One more note: a lot of people play up this game's difficulty. Listen. It has a little bit of a learning curve, yes. But I have faith in you. If I was able to beat the game and get the true ending in 20 hours, you can do it too. You've got this. The process of learning is to figure out why you got hit by an attack and then figure out what you have to do not to get hit by that attack - you have a bunch of defensive options available. Get that down and you're golden. It's really that simple, and it's not as hard as you think.",1704179545,1704182155,True,1,0,0.509536802768707275,0,True,False,False

When I start the game it's at 2500 MB, and 30 minutes later it's at 6500. If I play for more than 2 hours it will start running out of memory to even display elements of my desktop, and that's with an RTX 3080. Essentially, you have to restart the game every 30-60 minutes. This is something that I have seen people complain about since the game's release, yet still hasn't been fixed. 

That said, the game is actually quite fun. It's like a mashup of the hardcore ""souls-like"" elements and critical parrying of Sekiro and the environmental beat-em-up of Yakuza. The art style is great, the level design is memorable, the mechanics are engaging, the story is cool, and the Mandarin voice acting is quite nice. I started out playing on Master, which I only recommend if you are serious about challenging yourself. I have permanently unlocked (that means unlocked six times) more than half the skills and still haven't beaten the second boss. It's a hard game, but one where practice genuinely feels rewarding.

The difficulty ramp is mostly consistent, controls are tight, and the game play loop is satisfying (and upsetting when you're sucking). The story is a revenge tale with a couple of twists, and it hits just right for me. The stages are VERY interesting visually and the art style is gorgeous.

My suggestions for the devs:
1) The amount of times the game throws you into poorly lit arenas with half a dozen or more enemies can be infuriating. I'd like to see what's kicking my ass, thanks.
2) It'd be nice if the Training room would allow you to practice fighting the boss BEFORE you beat them (but after you meet them). It's frustrating to fight through an entire stage over and over only to get obliterated by boss moves you don't know how to counter. Also adding in life bars in training would be awesome!
3) Short unskippable cutscenes at the beginning of each stage...maybe it's just because I'm terrible, but I'm WAY too familiar with those painful 5 second long camera pans and would love to skip them after attempting a stage for the 10th time.
4) The camera is mostly good, though can be far too pulled in during fights in tight spaces.

However my biggest problem with Sifu is only 5 levels to the main story. It took me about 9 hours to beat the main story on medium difficulty (Disciple), and I am pretty average with games like this. The games bosses are quite difficult as they should be but the last boss is a great difficulty spike got stuck on it for a bit and then something just clicked and now all bosses are kinda easy being able to do most bosses deathless. I did also go through and complete to my knowledge both endings of the game and I will say its interesting but not going to beat a proper story game obviously. I haven't really touch all the arena stuff but from my limited time there is alot of content and very good challenge if you want to 100%, arena could probably take up 30 hours just trying to perfect the list. 

Also I'd like to say there a reasons to play through the levels even if your finished the main story, whether it be go back through the levels trying to get highest score or least deaths, or for the little pieces of lore which require you to get items like keys or such and bring them back to the appropriate level. Quite enjoyable to see the little areas locked off to you in the beginning and come back to see whats inside.

Definitely consider this game when its on sale.

Although the revenge story is relatively simple, the characters shine through with each line of degrading dialogue they spit at you during combat. I may not be a huge fan of kung fu or martial arts cinema, but this game makes you feel like you're living in one. The combat is incredible to say the least. One thing I have to say is that it can be difficult with the tight timing, but the death system gives you ample opportunities to learn if you're willing. It'll take around 10 hours to complete, although it obviously depends on how well you play. Please don't take this to mean that you shouldn't take your time to fully appreciate the experience. I do despise the camera angles sometimes, especially when you're next to a wall or in a group of enemies. If you're interested in gaining more content with mods since this is on the shorter side, there is a thriving modding community consistently releasing additions to Sifu. I would definitely recommend some of the Matrix mods or getting outfits such as Daredevil.

The art style is great and even though there aren't a lot of levels they are varied and well crafted.

Animations are smooth and very satisfying.

Story is a classical revenge plot done well.

The age mechanic is very punishing however a really good addition which goes well with the story.

The controls are what I truly don't like here. You need perfect timing and yet you have to use the analog stick on controller for moving, directional input for special attacks and to evade. One on one fights this works and they are very enjoyable, but in gank fights which you often find in this game it's horrible,

Every level there are larger and larger ganks, I just beat level 3 and it had one room with 8-9 people + 2 big guys that charge at you or try to throw you. The only counter to throw is to evade and you evade with holding block + flick down on the left analog stick however down seems to be relative to your character + the position of the enemy. In 3-rd person view when I'm fighting so many people how can I know which direction down even is then?

Some can say, oh you are supposed to use the environment, don't let yourself be surrounded and such. How do you avoid 11 people except from running home :D

Bosses are fun and I like that you can spare them. I don't like that you get the execute button prompt and have to avoid pressing it when the game trains your brain to press those two buttons as soon as you see them.

I restarted the 1-st level so many times just because I executed the boss by mistake in second phase. If you're not the one playing this may seem cool, like you must resist the urge of vengeance. To me it means I just ruined my perfect run and have to start over again.

Is this game good? Yes, but it annoys the hell out of me for all the wrong reasons.

Fast forward years and years later, Sifu is everything I wanted from that combat and more. Admittedly it does have a very tough learning curve in the second level but once you get over that by learning to avoid and not button mashing, its an incredible game to keep improving yourself on.
I thought the Arena game mode was just a supplementary free addon, but after playing a while I feel like it could have been its own full game as well, the challenges are well designed with custom levels (with some reused assets from the story mode), each one subtly teaches you to master an aspect of the deep combat system.

Which is not necessarily a bad thing, but does  limit who is going to be playing the game. If you like more complicated move-sets, then this might be for you. But if not, stop reading and play something else.

Enemies would telegraph their moves, but not long enough for me to comprehend. Going back to the game's complex moves, almost each attack has its own counter that needs to be pressed in a small time frame. If you use the wrong one, you might as well have not been touching the controller. Even after playing for a while, I felt it was very difficult to keep track of all the enemies around me and counter each one perfectly. Granted this can just be a ""skill issue"" that can be avoided by getting good, but it seems more unfair than other games. In dark souls, I will die, but it never feels like death is my fault, and I know what I did to improve for the next run. Not to mention the camera can hide moves from enemies, which is just a poor oversight.

The aging system is a neat idea, but I don't really understand how it works story wise. Not that there was much a story to begin with. Your mentor gets killed, so you avenge him by the perpetrator and his crew. This was possibly developed more as I progressed further, but I couldn't be bothered playing this when I felt like I was fighting the game rather than enjoying it.

I got it when it was on sale for $20 bucks, but even that felt like too much. I'm not sure who this game was made for, maybe veteran Souls players? Who knows.

[h2] Sifu? More like see (my) foot before it hits your face [/h2] 

[b] Sifu [/b]is a one of a kind fighting-brawler game. It's actually not like other brawler games much. I would say it's more akin to Soulsborne games where it requires your full attention and patience to play well. You got your ala parry, dodge and counter attack timings. But boiling it down to just three elements is too simple. There's also the rhythm and the ""zen state"" that you learn to just enter. It's quite similar to Sekiro, to be honest, except you have two options to deal with offensives--dodging and parrying.

The game is broken down into ""stages"" where you have to infiltrate, beat up a bunch of angry Chinese kung-fu grunts and elites and bosses alike. Where it separates itself from most Souls games though, is that it encourages you to stay in the fight vs. dodge rolling. There isn't really a dodge roll in Sifu. It's more like a stand-in-place-become-an-I-frame-avatar dodge. So you have to deal with whoever's trying to land a punch on you either way.

There's a virtual progression in the game in the form of perks like extending your HP, getting more focus per hit, etc. but in my opinion, the true progression and level up happens within you (which is what makes these kinds of games great).


[h2] Highly Recommended...with some caveats [/h2]

If you know anything about Souls-seki-borne games, they're [b] notoriously hard[/b]. And you will die. You will die [b] a lot[/b]. They're hard for a reason. Sifu is slightly more forgiving than most Souls games. For one, there's a difficulty selector. That makes it quite accessible to a wider audience. However, even at the easiest difficulty, the game demands a level of mastery from the player that may or may not appeal to everyone. If you like progressing your own skill level as a player, you're gonna love Sifu a lot. However, if you're more into casual games (which aren't bad, by the way) you should think twice before getting Sifu due to it's pretty steep barrier-to-entry.

But, if you're up for the challenge, you should start the path to Sifu. I promise it'll be worth it in the end.",1680691965,1703202478,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

So I kept trying.

This game is genuinely AMAZING from top to bottom!

The action feels real due to how flush and natural the controls are, you will need a full controller or kb/m though!
The soundtrack is insanely catchy, and incredibly in depth, and make the environments really feel real alongside enhancing the emotions the story portrays in each moment. The art design is incredible, the game is BEAUTIFUL but runs smooth as butter! 
The combat flows so incredibly well, you're a one man army, but you're not invincible either. The special inputs are done wonderfully, and every move/dodge/parry/grab feels snappy and responsive.

One thing not talked a lot about is the way the age works, and I'll explain the best way I can:
-Die:
What to do when dead = level up abilities/moves (you don't have to die to level them up, there are also altars)
 EITHER: Age up a year or more depending on what year you are currently. 
 OR: restart the stage at the age you started said stage at.
-WARNING: Age up too much ~70 you age out and have to restart the stage, thus a Gameover. You'll lose level, progress, and any NON-PERMANENT abilities/moves.
To make an ability/move PERMANENT simply level it up around five times. 
PERMANENT Abilities/Moves: You keep them no matter what per save.
 For example: If you gain a permanent on Stages 2-3, but want to be younger, you can retry Stage 1, and keep your Permanent Abilities.
RESETTING AGE: You can replay from stage 1 to update your age as long as you perform better than previously. (yes you can just replay stage 1 then go to stage 3, BUT it will just subtract the stage 2 years from the new stage 1 years)

anywho,

====================
I wish it was longer, and at this point in my life that's high praise. It's really, really well made. No rough corners, no rushed design. It feels like it was made by passionate developers who took their time and refined it down to perfection. I think the only reason it isn't Overwhelmingly Positive is because 1.) It's short and 2.) It's difficult. Both of those are valid and true, so if you want something long or easy this isn't for you.

Overview
====================
It doesn't fit well into one genre. It's like you took the combat from the Arkham games and sprinkled a little bit of fighting game tech (nothing too difficult execution-wise). If you like combat in Arhkam games or Assassins Creed you'll like the fighting system here, but it's a bit more difficult (in a fun way, I promise).

The campaign that wraps it all up is a bit like a roguelite. If the aging mechanic sounds offputting to you, think of it like a roguelite instead. You can always replay a portion of the campaign to try to improve your ""best run"" and take the gains forward into the next level. No failure is permanent and the only wall you'll really hit is the kind of ""git gud"" wall you'd hit in a Souls game.

""It's difficult""
====================
Yeah, it is.... but I'm 33 years old and I beat it in about 10 hours. I have the advantage of having played every Souls game and having some fighting game experience... but that fighting game experience was just enough for me to realize I don't have the reactions to keep up with the kids :P . It's a challenge, and if you've never beaten a Souls game or competed in a fighting game I would still encourage you to try this game out, but urge you to embrace the challenge and fight the instinct to get frustrated when things aren't going your way. It IS beatable. It CAN be learned. If you sleep on it and come back the next day you'll make progress and it will feel good. If you're already into competitive games (without raging at them too hard :P), or perhaps you enjoy practicing martial arts or an instrument in real life, then you probably already have the mindset to enjoy this game.

""It's short""
====================
Yeah, it is. To me that's a plus. I'll take a game that leaves me wanting more over a game that bores me before I beat it any day of the week. It's like when you go to a fancy restaurant and the portions are small for the price. It's not a ""value"" meal. It's a rich, delicious, indulgent luxury meal. I promise, even if you end up frustrated by the difficulty of the combat, you won't find any other flaws. The visuals, the audio, the animations, the voice acting... It's just so refined. Like bonsai tree, it may be small but the amount of love and care that went into it makes it a true gem.",1702091131,1702091131,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story is cool but minimal and very short (5 short levels), the art style really grew on me, gameplay is damn cool too.

However, as a former playstation exclusive i was confident it would support dualsense (as advertised).
It does not but there are mods.

I encountered a crash to desktop mid-challenge.

So far,

Story : 5/10
Gameplay : (8-2)/10
Graphics : 10/10
Performance : (10-1)/10

Total : 7.5/10

However, i will deduct two point.
This is a former playstation exclusive and yet does not support playstation controllers but xbox only.
Normalizing that could at worst lead to more and more controller-optimized games to be unplayable on PC (at least without mods).
I will also deduct 0.5 because, were it not for mods, this game would be nigh unplayable.

You age as you lose, and start each of the (only) five missions at the age you finished the last mission - very unusual but somewhat refreshing. 
The game play is smooth enough with some glitching between levels and area's. The combat is outstanding but takes getting used too. 

This game is kind of ridiculously hard on the keyboard but I tried my PS5 controller and it was immediately playable (no button changes needed). It hurts my hands to play with a controller for longer than two missions or so because the button mashing is intense. Learn the moves to avoid this.

As a fan of Ninja, stealth, and fighting games this is excellent.

The price point is well worth it - much more reasonable than other labels and games with less to offer.

It is as repetitive as Ground-Hog Day so strap in if you like that sort of thing. If repeating levels annoys you, this one has only the 5 levels. It's about combat perfection, there is no sand box experience - just 5 levels. Note; you open up new areas and short cuts in each level and gain permanent skills as you grind. 

Recommened for those people that like to perfect combat and gameplay.

Every aspect of Sifu appeals to me in such glorious fashion, from the gameplay, story, the visuals, and OH most [i]definitely[/i] the music. I immediately copped this game on launch, clocking in about [b]108+[/b] hours of playtime (99h 56mins on Epic Games Store + 9 hours on Steam just to 100 percent it and write this review lol) after being so intrigued by its State of Play trailer appearance and have been following its progress since.

[h2]Gameplay[/h2]
I'm a big sucker for 'die & try again' beat-em-ups (Hades, BloodBorne) but ooh boy, how this game has humbled me into thinking I was good at the much later levels. Each engagement is quick & snappy, leaving little room to improvise and more room to take the beatings and play on different strategies for the next run. 

Sifu's learning curve is the album cover for Arctic Monkey's [i]AM[/i], and you will generally feel more discouraged to give up than to continue, but with how the game is structured, which intends for players to replay the first four levels a good amount of times before reaching the big boss, the result is super rewarding. I have to admit, I did take notes on a couple of speedrunners to figure out which combos are best suited for each situation and enemy type but ultimately, you will inevitably develop the ""right"" way to fight and also end up utilising [i]every[/i] skill in your arsenal to gain the upper-hand for each encounter.

[h2]Story[/h2]
I wasn't familiar with the concept of Wude but I am a big fan of narratives transitioning from revenge plots to transforming into the better person type-beat stories. I love the idea, that the purpose of Kung Fu, devoid of militaristic intent, is not an art-form used to hurt other or be used in violent engagements. Our main character (I'm surprised they don't have a name lol), after witnessing his father's death; has festered an innate wrath for eight years, and went on a killing spree across the city. Initially, you'd be on board because its totally justified, however the principle of Kung Fu and the Eastern ideology of ""pacifism unless provoked"" is a much more endearing trait of character growth and maturity, which is fitting for a game that literally has you become wiser as you age from each death.

All the characters (yes, even you Jinfeng) are all such interesting and hapless creatures, each with a unique backstory that makes all of them worthy of sympathy. These five bosses aren't your typical cookie cutout villains, but victims of a cause that forced them to take matters into their own hands to eventually achieve their lifelong dreams, to which some ended up saving their lives, or diminished by it (Poor Fajar).
I feel like I would've appreciated the characters, their backstories, and intertwined relationships a bit more if the lore was more vocal about it, presentation wise; rather than just tidbit clues discoverable for the Detective Board. I was so intrigued about ""The Guardians"", Yang's tragedy and the lead up to our main story, to which I feel bummed out about how it couldn't be visually expanded but I understand that's not the direction they went with, yet I still find the end result enjoyable as always.

Also, I appreciate all the references to martial arts films and easter-eggs relating to popular martial-arts cinematic culture in game, it makes me so giddy every time I have one of the costumes equipped. Even though the fighting style is Pak-Mei, I can't help but draw comparisons to 'Ip Man', one of my favourite Chinese films and its comparable Wing Chun style.

[h2]Art & Music[/h2]
I usually pair these chapters in the Story section, but Sifu's Art and Sound Direction is too good to not be given its own praise. Howie Lee does an amazing job of composing intense feelings of rushing drive and determination in the music. Lee's background in the electronica/dance genre served extremely satisfactory in capturing the fast-paced, high-energy fight choreography that's present in each encounter. That, and the combination of elements derived from traditional Chinese instruments, as well as the addition of unorthodox sounds picked from their respective levels (e.g. train horn in The Squats), really amplifies the creative world-building and feeling of a fulfilled and alive environment.

Shout-out to Paul Emile-Boucher and the well-deserving art team for creating such a beautifully stunning art-style that's so aesthetically pleasing to look at [b]while I curb-stomp a fool on the edge of a table.[/b] The concept art-esque mix with semi-cartoon, oil painting style is such an creatively interesting approach, art-wise and game design wise. A game like Sifu could've definitely went along the photo-realistic route like most Souls-like entries, but instead, Sifu's art direction allowed to enhance its storytelling through the eased manipulation of the environment and interpretations of major concepts of each character without delivering an excess-use of dialogue (Kuroki's Museum is a perfect example of this and one of my favourite levels).
If you were to make an anime based on Sifu, keeping the art-style is a must.

[h3] TL:DR [/h3]
Sifu is a magnificently constructed action adventure, offering painstaking droves of challenging yet rewarding foes. Its unique ""death = aging"" mechanic provides all players of intermediate experience, a fighting chance to adapt from and improve upon their mistakes.

When it comes to bosses it seems these devs don't truly understand boss fighting,
Combat which can be fluid is replaced with an enemy that does brunt force attacking with very little openings, and the openings feel like you are hitting a brick wall, I understand the opponent is supposed to be good, but you get hit with 3 kicks to the stomach no matter who you are and you are going to stumble for a few seconds. 
This is a cop-out difficulty style you see in a lot of amateur developers when it comes to balancing a boss fight.
Hopefully if they continue to release games they realize their flaws in boss fights and learn from them, cause every boss fight feels like a chore and not a real battle.

tl;dr The game would be better with slower paced combat, there are some inputs that literally ask for a delay in input and can't even be used half the time because you are being blitzed 90% of the time.

The lore is nothing to write laurels about but gets the job done. The strength of the game is the core gameplay loop with fluid action set pieces where something badass is always happening and its the player controlling the character doing it, not a prerendered cutscene.

The game has five different stages excluding the prologue and has a ton of replay value. Each stage is visually distinct as well as feature variety of enemy types. The stages offers a level of lore connectivity that makes replaying the same level albeit with a collectible from a future stage give more lore into the individual bosses as well as the overarching story.

The tutorial of the game does a not so good job of explaining the various defensive mechanics of the game. Each defensive mechanic is equally important however the tutorial seems to emphasize on parrying as the go to defensive mechanic. Remember to watch a tips and tricks short tutorial to derive maximum value out of the gameplay.

I'm also really not a fan of the resurrection mechanic or how you can only restore health from beating mini-bosses(and it doesn't always restore the same amount of health) or from doing a take down of the weaker enemies.

Hell, this is the most I've enjoyed a game in a few years that I can remember. Sifu is difficult with a fairly high skill curve so if that's not your jam then I'd say pass. It's not a ""1 button press and you can get through it"" type game. It's a ""analyse the situation and try to remember the 30 or so button combinations to win properly. Also don't forget when to block, when to dodge, and which way to dodge - all which require distinct button presses."" type game. I still get cornered plenty (not something you want to do) and spaz out with my button presses, but am definitely getting more confident with each run. I *just* got through my first level with just one death (which was most definitely avoidable) about 10 minutes ago and just want to replay for that perfect no-death level run. I also have only made it through to the beginning of 3rd out of the 5 levels.

Graphically I love the aesthetic and the sound design is fairly good as well. I've experienced 0 technical issues - no crashes, no weird bugs, or anything of the sort.

This is definitely not for a casual gamer and I can see why not everyone loves it. But if you can press through the first couple hours and see how potent certain combinations can be and don't mind the difficulty and skill curve, I promise you'll love it. I will update the review once I beat the game and play the ""Arenas.""

Edit: 40 hour review:

Finally completed the story mode. Yeah, 40 hours in because I realized for my skill level the age required to beat the final boss required I replay a few areas without dying or only dying once. I still wholeheartedly recommend Sifu and it is likely my top brawler game of all time, even though I've dumped 100s of more more hours into the Street Fighter series (at least up until IV) since the 90s. It is a game that requires a good amount of skill and hours to get good enough to complete. The story mode could easily be beaten in under 30-45 minutes once you've developed the skillset needed. I normally do not like games like this any more since my gaming time is generally limited, but there is just something that kept bringing me back for more. Maybe because I liked the feeling of being a badass and that the game just got progressively harder with a ""Eh, you're not THAT good"" reminders it kept throwing out at me. I'm on the fence as to if I'm going to attempt to 100% this, but I definitely will start this up at least a few more times to check out Arenas.

A couple of things issues I did come across that I didn't notice in my initial review: the camera can sometimes rotate in a way that makes it very difficult to see what is happening. It happened more than a few times which was frustrating. The second issue was that a number of times I would start a combo or attack on one enemy, and another enemy would approach and the combo/attack would inadvertently get executed on the second enemy - it didn't happen nearly as often as the camera issue, but enough to be annoying. I wish the devs would come back and patch a camera improvement, but it seems like at this point they've moved on to their next project.

Also, as a note - most ""how to defeat x in Sifu"" video tutorials out there are trash. They involve cheesing bosses and generally running around and attacking. This will do nothing except screw up getting the ""true"" ending and will definitely make the final boss fight much, much harder for you to defeat. Practice in the ""training"" mode and just remember - parry and dodge are what you want to focus on.

Edit: final update. The Arenas for the most part of fun, but some challenges (and modifiers) can be really annoying. Definitely am not going to try and 100% this and it can be really frustrating. Also, I have experienced right around 10 crashes in the Arenas, and only experienced one in my entire playthrough of the main story.",1699325159,1701578816,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The core fighting gameplay feels kind of like a more complex, refined version of Arkham Asylum style combat with additional inspiration from Sekiro. There's a lot of moves at your disposal and you can really get creative and develop a style. My only complaint is that in group fights, you often don't have time to actually use a lot of your cooler moves because a goon will try and hit you in the back while you're doing them. Realistic, but always makes me sad.

The game could do a better job of explaining and easing you into some of its mechanics, in particular how defense works. How parries actually work, how to dodge attacks high/low, and when you want to do either one are not immediately obvious. Once you get it, you get it, but it can be a big source of frustration early on.

The levels themselves are really tightly designed too instead of just being an excuse to do one combat setpiece after another. The environments are beautiful and the encounter design is interesting. 

I think the story is pretty good too. I wasn't really expecting anything out of it, but it surprised me. There's a fair bit of interesting backstory you can glean if you pay attention, and the main story is classic but well-told. Getting all the endings is not terribly obvious but once you know what you're supposed to do it is straightforward.

The age mechanic is a genius way to get you to replay levels. The game as a whole really makes you feel like you're learning and improving into a kung-fu master, and not just by letting you unlock abilities. You can see your progress as you manage to clear levels with barely a scratch that you previously were barely able to finish.

I have to say, Chinese culture is DYING to get some good representation in video games and Sloclap have done a stellar job here. There is even Mandarin and Cantonese voice acting available! That's shockingly rare in western games.

The OST is great and they did such a good job of syncing it up with the in-game action.

I think the boss fights are the weakest part of the game. They aren't all terribly interesting and tend to have a specific gimmick to them. Some of them in particular can feel frustrating because they feel like a departure from what the rest of the game is trying to teach you, mechanics-wise.

It's premier game mechanic is a talisman that brings you back into the fight a little older upon death, with each decade of life granting you more power and speed at the cost of health. Every death increases the amount of years you grow older exponentially, but a hard won victory can decrease the punishment. Progression has two-tiers split between ""shrines"" and abilities. This helps coax you into the rhythm of Kung-fu, as each make you a little stronger in a different way. Abilities are bought with fight xp. They vanish when you die your final death when your talisman breaks (the death after you turn 70). Each time you buy the same ability, however, you count towards its ""permanent unlock,"" ensuring it'll never go away upon death, new levels, or retrying old ones. Permanent unlocks will have your back, even in time travel. Shrines, on the other hand, are very powerful upgrades that only occur 2-4 times per level. And your access to them depends on the CURRENT timeline. If you choose an upgrade, die, and restart the level, the upgrade is gone. If you finish a level and move to the next, it remains with you insofar as you keep the progress of that finished level. Your anti-death talisman is in essence a time machine. You can redo old levels but it will change your shrine progression in the next. Certain objects like collectables/plot pieces are never altered once you collect them, no matter what you do. It took me a while to completely this system, but I appreciate the care that went into balancing the game in this way. Sifu is hard, it encourages you to repeat the same few levels and ""get gud."" If you don't, you're practically doomed. Even on the lowest difficulty, this game isn't for someone who doesn't want to or legitimately can't learn. But it masterfully digitizes the very real repetitive aspect of martial arts; martial artists train for hours striking the same dummy with the same punch to master the technique, and Sifu players beat down the same enemy playthrough after playthrough trying to master their approach. The game requires you to do things properly before you can even access a shortcut, and once you can you still have to weight the consequences. Shortcuts drastically reduce your progression potential, so taking every one will render you underpowered in a successively harder landscape. These aforementioned methods are how Sifu, a small game with 5-6 levels, a few gigabytes on disk, and incredible framerates on lower end hardward, is able to be packed with a massive amount of replay ability and a jaw-dropping level of care put into each section. Sifu is well worth it. It's not a sprawling game and the message is simple. But it's the definition of efficiency in design.

[h3][b]SHU / 守[/b][/h3]
You've already read Sifu's summary on this page so I won't be repeating it or how it plays. Sifu is much like an actual Sifu telling you to do better, without much coddling, if any at all. It is INFURIATING in its gameplay and too repetitive with its miniscule scope of contents, with your attacks blocked every other seconds alongside myriads of enemies and bosses that kills you over and over without respite. Makes you wonder why you purchased this game at all..

[h3][b]HA / 破[/b][/h3]
Well.. that's what I would have said about the game on my first day of playing anyway.

Fun is subjective, and the kind of fun within Sifu is better described by myself as ""satisfaction"". I get catharsis when I pull off a counter at the right time, making micro-decisions that allows me to win an engagement, that could only be achieved through constant and constant grind of pure skill and defeats. Sifu is, true to it's Steam store page summary, realistic. If we're being nitpicky, one could claim that the Arcane-styled graphics isn't realism or that enemies being HP sponges isn't realistic when you're so comparatively fragile. But that's not where the realism is meant to lie. It lies in the game design and how it encapsulates the entire idea of martial arts. It is monotonous with its animations and basic defenses and attacks. Guess what else is monotonous? Martial arts and the practising of martial arts. Wax on, wax off, anyone? 

There are strong arguments in favour of as well as against realism in video game debates. People play to blow off steam, and that realism isn't inherently fun. And that's true. Practising martial arts, for most people, wouldn't rank high on the fun activities chart. Dying over and over to a system that is immutable (you can't change your stats for the better for the most part and the enemies are always the same) isn't fun. So going by that, Sifu shouldn't exist as a video game. And yet.. Sifu exists as the antithesis of those statements. It gives you a different sense of fun, which would have been difficult before it came along.

It gives you ""fun"" when you eventually, subconsciously, figure out the attack patterns of your enemies and then pulling off the appropriate responses to it. You stop second-guessing yourself and feel proud at how you can now play at an expert level after a period of time getting good. It's like the earning of dopamine released in our brain: [b]You can get an immediate release of the feel-good chemicals when you jerk off, or you can do some grueling exercises for a lengthier and lower releases of that same feel-good chemicals[/b]. One gives you immediate gratification, but the other has a longer lasting impact on your psyche. 

This would only work if the game does actually give you fun at some point, and it does. This would not have worked if the ""endpoint"" was not fun. The only difference is here, is how and when do you get your fun and satisfaction. Sifu is not an argument for more video games to be made like this, but a special exception, proclaiming that it is possible to feel just as good playing it, as it is for other games. The ""novelty"" of it is in the delivery method of fun.

[h3][b]RI / 離[/b][/h3]
Sifu is personally, my GOTY and as such I've nominated it for that award on Steam. It is extremely uncompromising with its design and mechanics (on the original and Master difficulty) and does not attempt to cater to a wide crowd of audiences. That in of itself, its a feat worth commending, and I would consider it ""art as a video game"". I understand that because of said lack of compromises for the wider audiences, it will turn off a lot of people from playing this, and prevent it from being on the forefront of mainstream popularity with other contemporaries, like the Yakuza / Like A Dragon series or Genshin Impact. But does it need to be? It doesn't need to. It has found a special place in my heart and mind, and that's all it needed to do. And I am not alone in thinking this.

If you are someone who wants a 3rd-person melee combat game with an expansive amount of content, as well as constant fun ON THE WAY of mastering said games and a balance between zany fun and genuine difficulty, the Yakuza series is what you want to play. I'd recommend 0 if you've never played it before. (Link: https://store.steampowered.com/app/638970/Yakuza_0/)

[b]BUT[/b] if you are someone who understands that you'll be forgoing most of what I just mentioned in lieu for catharsis towards the ""end"" where you become a Sifu of the game in your own right, then it is very much a game for you as much as it is for me.

Game Design: 
-parry mechanic timing is way too much guess work - the parry window is very strict
-trash mobs that can be beat eyes closed
-tougher dudes that take a lot of punishment to beat and have unblockable moves - worth like 5-6 regular ones
-bosses have super combos that can't be evaded or parried and do a ton of damage
-bosses have superior movement abilities and can block all your attacks or just plain ignore them as they hit you through them
-most of the time the focus strike mechanic will not fire even with full focus bar
-protagonist that is made of glass but can seemingly resurrect but has less and less health and has less and less damage resistance

It's like the game has 'artificial hardness' which makes the game super grindy and unnecessarily punishing. 

The concept for the game is awesome though - kungfu style beat em up - too bad they missed the mark in the sense that it could of been flashier, for ecample by inserting more places where you could do environmental damage to the enemies, there are some but not really that much. Also, you need to use melee weapons a lot if you want to succeed at all, and that takes away from the kungfu hand to hand melee aesthetic.

Above is based on playing the game on the 'Disciple' difficulty which I guess is the 'normal' difficulty. I guess I'll try playing it with easy and see if it's more enjoyable.

The story is alright (bit of a mystery mixed with a revenge). I do want to give praise to the devs for getting the idea of the moral code of martial arts, or ""wude"", right. You can also feel the passion and love for martial arts from the game, with many moves recognizable from Chinese martial arts and some stage sections referencing fight scenes from films (old boy hallway comes to mind).

The game play loop is well made, and combat feels responsive and intuitive for the most part. Controls are simple: you got your light/weak attack, your strong/heavy attack, a side step/ dodge key, and a block key that is also used with your movement keys for dodging in spot (dodge a low with block + up, or dodge a mid/high with block + down). So it's simple to pick up and play.

Now the game I think is very much a rhythmic and pattern recognition game at its core. You have to recognize patterns and timings to dodge or parry attacks. As such there's some knowledge, but also a lot of reaction. At first it'll be real hard, but with time the game does get easier.

Now with all that praise, let's get to the parts that I have issues with:

1) Performance. Even on a fairly decent computer there is stuttering at parts, like when you enter a specific area, or turn the camera too quickly. The frame drops are minor and not frequent, but it's noticeable when it happens.

2) Camera. The camera does lots of things automatically for you, like locking to opponents, shifting and zooming in and out based on the area or angle,etc. The worst is when you have a tight space, and your character is ganged on and the camera man zooms in, basically literally inside the character. It's a tough issue, and understandably challenging for devs to work around with, but it's still annoying. So if you want to survive, better find a good camera angle to start a fight in.

3) Difficulty. You know the game is difficult, when looking at any of the unlock-able skills, and it's all extra moves or build meter faster, but no extra health or extra defense (well I guess extra structure, or the meter that shows how much your character is allowed to block before being guard broken, counts as extra health). I feel like the game takes a Dark Souls-like approach to difficulty - you gonna learn or you gonna die. Unless you got lightning reflexes, prepare to die and get old a bit, especially during first play through. While the game does slowly teach you and ramp up the difficulty through the stages, there are parts where new enemies with new patterns appear, and if you never seen them before, it's hard to dodge that low sweep mix, especially since you have been conditioned to dodge low (duck high attacks) with most of the mobs only doing high or mid attacks.

I feel like I'll rant too much, so I'll just say even if you beat the game once and have gotten a grasp of the system, you can still get wrecked really quickly if you take a fight wrong.

Final thing worth mentioning is you'll also be fighting crowds a lot, and fighting the crowd auto targeting system the game has. It's not terrible, and controlling a crowd isn't that bad, but there are two issues I find a little annoying:

1) The moment you are about to complete a combo on one enemy, the next guy/gal will jump in to hit you. I guess it's to add a nice flow and also to keep you on your toes, but it's really annoying at times, especially when I'm in my chain punches and I get hit because I was a little off with my parry (well to be fair, parry is supposed to be hard and rewarding, dodging is safer and equally viable, albeit you don't damage opponent's structure).

2) Also the game is a lot about breaking the opponent's balance (or structure as it's called) to deal a finishing blow. You can either break structure or reduce health to zero, whichever comes first. Most times you'll actually want to break structure (as it's usually faster). Now here's the neat part about a group fight - your character will often, as you finish up a combo and reduce an opponent's structure to just before breaking, switch lock on to the next opponent jumping into the fray, making sure that the person who almost got structure broken will get a second wind (structure bar recovers fast if you don't engage). So often you'll want to whittle numbers down, only to get interrupted before you can KO someone so that the fight becomes all chaotic like a scene out of that Bruce Lee movie where he goes and group fights a Karate dojo (or when Ip Man challenges the 10 black belt Karatekas), except they both knock out a person before taking on the next.

So yeah, overall it's a fun game and a unique style of martial art game with lots of cool things and I did enjoy it a lot. However it is also quite punishing with the dodge and parrying timing and demands focus (which is neat and kinda true to the spirit of sports and martial arts). When it flows well, it really is fun, but some of the situations with the camera and group fighting does get annoying and frustrating.",1701161724,1701163759,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I mean this is the kinda game I could see people giving up after the second level, it's tremendously difficult. Art style is a 10/10, gorgeous graphics and animations (which should be expected from the developer of Absolver, another gem of a game). The animations really shine here, it's gorgeous to look at. I recommend giving it a shot, though of course with the knowledge that it's brutal. Don't go into it thinking that it's like Dark Souls or Sekiro. Those games always strike me as reactionary in a sense, that the character reacts to attacks and the better you are the quicker you are to react and analyze positioning etc. This game has some of that, but combat is way more precise. If you try to simply react you'll get killed very quickly. It requires careful planing that's way more reserved compared to the minute to minute gameplay that souls games have (cf. Doom Eternal too). With that in mind though, I give it very high marks, it's excellent. Pick it up. Pick. It. Up.

EDIT: Alright, I think this game has one of the strongest ludo-narrative cohesion ever. SPOILERS for some minor game play elements. I havn't seen this discussed in many places so I thought it's important to mention it. There is a way to spare the big baddies. BUT the game makes it way more difficult to do that than to just kill them outright. This is absolutely genius. The bad guys kill you and your father and tons of other people, but the message of the game is that the moral choice is far more difficult than the immoral one and this is reflected in game play. You essentially have to ""beat"" (not kill) the bosses three times to spare them, and I just find this so fascinating. Unlike other games where moral choices end up being a button prompt, in Sifu the choice literally means you have to be better than the boss skill wise as well as choice wise. This makes the choice so much more impactfu! Very interesting and ingeniously made game design.

All in all, Sifu is beautiful game, with a meaningful story that's all about learning how to be a better person--that the only real revenge is to be a better person than those who wronged you.",1680108117,1701123090,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The combat can be very fluid and engaging if understand how it works.  Which I imagine is why people would want to play it over and over. It actually made me feel like how they should have made the story mode for Yakuza games. Especially when came to picking up and using weapons. Which I rarely ever did in a Yakuza game. Generally only using my fist most of the time in those games. 
Thing doesn't really explain well in this game is guarding. Which I recommend using alot at first to learn and understand enemy attack sequences.  Guard can be broken if absorbing to many attacks. Though you can maneuver your body.  From left right down and up (which can still work on grapples).  To evade blows giving an opportunity or gap to attack. Game encourages deflecting at the start which is not good to try often when starting off imo. Since likely going to mess up a bit at first which is really going to cost you when constantly trying to deflect or parry. Think those are mainly beneficial for enemy power strikes though if fail to counter them and do devastating damage. There not very frequent and are usually used at the end of a combo. 
FYi I did just finish it on easy, though it was still pretty hard. There are actual cheats called modifiers which I never used which lock achievements.

There is an incredible sense of accomplishment when you finally beat a boss and I'm glad I didn't spoil that. Top 3 combat style games for me would be 3-Sleeping Dogs, 2-Batman Arkham series (has the champ finally been defeated?) and 1-Sifu. 
I would love to see other games made in this style and I think these devs could definitely do it. 
I see images of Shaolin vs Wu Tang, an Iron fist game that licensing would probably not allow and maybe even Bruce Leroy vs The Shogun of Harlem in 1985s The Last Dragon. This game gets me giddy and leaves me wanting more. Sifu gets my vote for game I love but suck at. lol

Vengeance. Redemption. Wude. 

When I first ran the game, I was really stunned - it's an unbelievable mix of a thrilling and immersive martial arts experience that transcends the boundaries of conventional action games. It's a gripping tale of vengeance and redemption, presented through intense, hand-to-hand combat. The story full of battles, in mind and on the field.

The most striking aspect of Sifu is its fluid and dynamic combat system, which seamlessly blends traditional martial arts movements with a modern gaming experience. Each fight feels like a carefully choreographed sequence, emphasizing precision, timing, and strategic decision-making. It really feels like you are engaged to fight, from start to end, planning each move and your positions in battle.

The game's narrative is a captivating journey that explores the themes of perseverance and determination. The protagonist's quest for revenge is portrayed with depth and emotional resonance, providing a compelling backdrop to the adrenaline-fueled action. The storytelling and character development keep me gripped through the game and invested in the protagonist's personal struggle.

To get the best experience in the game, you must master it. It is a bit difficult task (esp for a person like me, far away from MKs or Street Fighters), but it is worth the price.

10/10. Worth it.",1697918839,1700739642,True,11,0,0.645246028900146484,0,True,False,False

Initially I have an overall positive view of the game and highly recommended it based on the tight fight mechanics, artistic level design and superb story line that is very profound despite being low on narration and scripting.  All of these views still hold true but I have to say this is my favorite game of the year and have had it reflected as such with this years nominations.  

I found the game very difficult initially but nothing felt cheap or unmanageable.  Rather, I had to ""git gud.""  The good news is I did get a lot better, but I am no  where NEAR as good as I'd like to be! Whilst the game can be beat in an hour  or so, which is what some people complain of, it is absolutely not a fair way to critique this masterpiece.  

No one I know could pick this game up and just have the competence to complete the game without practice.  I'd recommend playing on disciple and then trying student to continue to practice if disciple is too difficult.  This game is VERY challenging but amazingly rewarding after you continue to make progress in a very similar fashion that Souls games offer.  I would honestly say that it would be extremely rare to buy the game and finish it on disciple in under 15-20 hours of play.  Perhaps one could on Student difficulty.  While I can already hear the ""OmG I finished the game in X time"" the stats say another story.  Only 9% of players have finished the game on any difficulty under 25 years old and around 16% under the age of 50.  The average person doesn't finish the game.  As the game rewards practice, you will likely find a lot of satisfaction seeing your practice pay off as that's what I found and continue to find true.  Ultimately I would like to finish this game on Master Difficulty at age 20.  I didn't even think I would be able to finish any level at age 20 when I first started!  

The combat is very dialed in, there are numerous ways to approach your enemies and take them on.  The graphics are nothing ground breaking but the artistic design, colouring, lay out all are congruent with the story and vibe of the game.  One more response to the people that would complain the story is short, those complaints don't factor into the arena mode that offers a TON of content in addition to the story with their own objectives.  As I am 48 hours into the game I have only scratched the surface of the DLC as I have been waiting until I had a good grasp of the main story complete.  

Overall, I think this was one of the biggest gaming surprises I have had in the past few years and recommend this game at full price or on sale.  10/10 for me.",1684199482,1700738506,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While the challenges add a lot of content I would have rather seen another full size level.


Bought it 25% off (€29,99). I think that price is about right, 40 is a bit much imo, gameplay and quality is all there and exceeding for that price, just the amount of content is 30 euro worth.


Edit 22-11-23:
Currently they've added a lot of challenges and modifiers, some of them are as difficult as can be and really challenge you to improve and optimize, however I would still argue my original point of rather having another full size level with a boss at the end over these challenges.

I also originally mentioned I would recommend the game on sale for around €30,- instead of the €40,- base price, I think with all the new content the game is worth it's full price, however this might not apply for all types of players.

If you're someone that wants to 100% complete games and do difficult challenges over and over again improving, trying to be the best, then it's worth the full €40, if you're more of a casual gamer looking for a fun fighting game and not really interested in the challenges then get it when it's on discount.",1691702280,1700684778,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Most inconsistent combats, I'd be fighting through a chapter just fine, and nope, all of a sudden your ""finisher"" doesnt finish the enemy you just used it on and the enemy is beefed up for no reason. Parry windows are a mess, and ineffective until you buy the upgrade. By chapter 3: basically everyone has a weapon, while if you can even get one in between fighting 5 people at a time, you drop it after getting hit once!! They would be usless if it wasnt for the fact that EVERYONE will have a weapon and the damage you do to the enemy 'stance' bar is negligible unless you are perfecting combos off on people. 

Visually: It was pleasing but for some reason their are NO graphics settings at all. GeForce Experience says everything is forced to ULTRA so underpowered pc's beware.

The absolute best beat'em'up genre representative. 
The combat system obviously is where Sifu truly shines. It's both challenging and rewarding. It demands precision and timing. Every fight just flows, like a dance, where each move counts. The aging mechanic, where your character gets older with each death, adds a unique twist to the gameplay which at this point is just a cherry on top. The absolute best element of the game is actually the combination of four different defenses which compliment each other just perfectly. 

The art style is stunning, environments are both beautiful and immersive. The level of detail in each scene complements the game's overall aesthetic, creating an engaging world that feels alive and dynamic. The soundtrack is captivating, enhancing the intensity of fights and the depth of the story. The sound effects of combat are crisp and satisfying, making each punch and kick feel impactful.

The plot is compelling, pretty cliche but cool nevertheless, driven by themes of revenge and mastery. 

The (higher) difficulty is be punishing, but never feels unfair. It encourages learning and adapting, prefectly embodying the spirit of martial arts where practice leads to mastery. Beautiful allegory.

Absolutely not, but I wouldn't have it any other way. 
I died countless times in this game, but not once did I feel like it was because of some BS moment or OP enemy, it was always my fault, my lack of awareness, slow reactions, pressing the wrong dodge button, not knowing how to use the environment to my advantage and not knowing the most effective combos.
This is a game that I have already finished quite a few times, given the trial and evolution narrative that is presented, and I am going to try to give a very honest review, targeting pros, mixed points, and cons.
Here it is:


PROS:
- Amazing art style and art direction, the clean, almost clay-like character models, objects and backgrounds give a vibe that I have never gotten from a game ever, it's pastel heaven one second, splash of color the other, and neon accents another. The game truly knows how to juggle light effects to it's advantage.
- Character designs are beautiful, the bosses truly have personality, it really felt like I was fighting actual martial arts masters, each with their own view on life and with their own lives and hobbies. Not to mention the very different fighting styles each of them has.
- The Music and Sound are damn amazing, and I recommend you play fully in Mandarin, English is fine but it feels a bit off at times, and Cantonese is just not good sounding imo...
- The Upgrade system is really interesting, it works in such a way that facilitates you playing levels multiple times, with each bought skill you get one step closer to permanently (buying a skill 5 times) unlocking it for future playthroughs. 
- The Pendant and Age mechanic is the whole gimmick of this game, and I think it's really well implemented. You die a lot of times and it creates a snowball effect, each death pilling up until you spiral out of control. While it can be frustrating, it forces you to adapt and evolve. Killing high value targets deletes 1 death off your death counter, as well as buying the reset death counter from the shrines available in all levels. With each 10 years that pass your damage increases and you health decreases (makes sense, you refine your skills but you are more frail with old age). Also, you can't teach an old dog new tricks, which is exactly why you have some shrine upgrades that can be bought only up until a certain age.
- Button mashing is not encouraged, it is punished. You have to wait and time your attacks, switch, dodge, throw enemies and parry their hits so that you can create opportunities to strike. It's like a dance of fists and kicks all the time, and you absolutely have to learn this dance well.
- Arenas are a very welcome addition to the game, with brand new locations based on the core game's locations, you have a ton of challenges, testing you score gathering abilities, your speed in killing enemies, and your crowd control skills. Getting 3 stars in every arena level is hard, but getting gold stamps is way harder, and can give you a ton of replayability in trying to perfect your performance.
- Perhaps the strongest point of Sifu, is the fact that once you finish the game the way you would expect to play it, that is killing everything that you encounter, you are greeted with the bad ending. Only by rewiring your brain and refining your skills you are able to replay the entire game and spare the bosses. Why would you? Because that's the good ending and the ultimate message of this game: ""He who has Kung Fu and Wude makes the other know he can break him. And the other doesn't want to fight anymore. This is Wude.""


MIXED: 
- The Storyline is nothing too crazy, it's a revenge story of a orphan Kung Fu student, however by completing the detective board you can learn quite a few new things and explore the whole picture, which I highly recommend you do.
- The game truly feels like a very polished old style arcade game, it is not easy, not forgiving at all, and it doesn't get easier, you just get better. Or you give up.
- Cheesing bosses works well on maybe 2/5 bosses, and by cheesing I mean waiting for an attack you know how to dodge and punish well, and disengaging all the other ones. Boring technique? Yes, but it works.
- The Training area feels a bit underdeveloped and bear-bones, but to be honest, who even uses it?


CONS:
- It is absolutely not worth buying the Costumes DLC, because you have to unlock them by playing and finishing very hard challenges, so if you think you can just use them because you paid for them, well, nah.
- Focus attacks are sometimes unresponsive and you can easily miss-click the one you want. I understand that you have to wait for a pause in the enemy attack to do them, but I still don't really enjoy that aspect. 
- You cannot get gold stamps in any Arena level, if don't know EXACTLY what the game wants you to do.


That being said, use every death as a means to progress and learn, don't give up when it gets frustrating, and enjoy your time seeking vengeance and trying to brute force through the game, you will realize how stupid and pointless that is, very quickly. Only then you will truly fall in love with this game, just like I did.",1693670086,1700656119,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you're into ""Sifu,"" you're probably in it for the badass combat and cool art style, not so much for the storytelling. But let me tell you, the story's all about seeking revenge for the tragic loss of the protagonist's family. The game is set in a world that's all about martial arts, and you get to be this determined hero on a kickass journey for justice. As the story goes on, you'll face all kinds of tough enemies, each with their own fighting style you'll need to master to kick their butts.

[h1] What makes ""Sifu"" truly unique? [/h1]
In ""Sifu,"" the aging mechanic is a central and innovative gameplay feature that sets it apart from traditional combat games. Whenever the player's character is defeated in battle, they experience the effects of aging. This means that each time the protagonist dies, they physically grow older, reflecting the toll of their arduous journey for vengeance.

However, the aging mechanic is not a mere punishment for failure. Instead, it serves as a strategic and transformative element of the game. As the character ages, they gain wisdom and unlock new abilities. This progression empowers the player to approach subsequent battles with a fresh set of skills, making the character more capable and experienced in combat.

This mechanic adds a layer of depth and complexity to the gameplay, encouraging players to learn from their mistakes and adapt their fighting style as they evolve throughout the game. It transforms defeat into an opportunity for growth, symbolizing the character's resilience and determination to overcome obstacles on their quest for justice.

The aging mechanic in ""Sifu"" not only reinforces the narrative themes of growth and personal development but also creates a dynamic and engaging gameplay experience, rewarding players with a sense of achievement and mastery over time. It beautifully intertwines the character's emotional journey with their physical prowess, making ""Sifu"" a truly unique and memorable martial arts gaming experience.

But wait, there's more! Both games share the mastery of parrying, a skill that transforms you into an untouchable force! Perfectly timed counters deflect enemy strikes, turning their aggression into a perfect opening for your own strikes. It's a dance of skill and finesse that rewards quick reflexes and calculated moves.

And let's not forget the art of the dodge, where agility and evasive prowess are your best friends! In ""Sifu"" and ""Sekiro,"" you'll be dodging, weaving, and sidestepping with grace, avoiding enemy attacks with sheer finesse. Be like a shadow, untouchable & elusive, ready to strike back with lethal precision.

Sifu is a relatively short but very hard game. This will test your limits the first time you play it, but once you get used to it and ""git gud"" at it, you start to enjoy the game in ways you did not enjoy the first time around.

You start trying to up your combos, die less times and even speed run the game. Over time you might find this game to be easier than you'd like. Well.... the devs got you covered. They added a ""hard"" mode. This mode is a significant step up in difficulty, making enemies more agressive and able to predict better your moves.

Of course you cant be keep playing the campaign over and over again. It's only five (master crafted) levels! The devs got you covered again! A new fighting mode, called Arenas was added. This mode consists of several challenges in different arenas, and I do mean several. Completing arenas will also grant you points to unlock new outfits which, by the way, are all very nice.

Also, at this point I have beaten the game twice and I have yet to play the arena mode. Overall, I really enjoyed Sifu with its unique combat style, story, and ability to teach patience. P.S.

If this is the first time you're playing sifu, you'll get your ass handed to you a lot. By trial and error you'll learn how the combat works and everything starts falling into place. In that way it feels like the most rewarding game.
This is hands down one of the best martial arts game. The combat is fluid with a high skill ceiling, has an amazing photo-mode which is complimented by the art style of the game and the soundtrack is just great. Glad they added some unlock-able outfits and arena mode which just adds to the replay value of the game.

But what moved me is that it has an underlying story which goes unnoticed for many.

This game revolves around the notion and implications of causality; and how every action we do comes at a cost. Should be follow in a patch of vengeance and deal every hurt we ever received, back to the ones that hurt us, or should we forgive them and seek enlightenment. No choice is made for us, as we need to forge our own path in a world on flames. The only question is do we walk down the blazing road, forging us anew in the trials of fire, or do we douse the flames to clear us that path to our ultimate goal.

Every bruises I receive is a reminder, that I have much to learn; every bone I break is a measure of my resolve and my determination, and every life I take or spare reflects what kind of person I strive to become.

The control scheme of the game is artificially inflated in difficulty because of how they require you to dodge attacks using the 'Avoid' mechanic, where you hold down the parry button, but also have to use the thumbstick to directionally dodge high or low attacks (90% of the time it's high attacks). General enemies are fine, occasionally they can feel cheap when they magically gain hyper armor for reasons, but it's not terrible. Some enemies and one specific boss attack VERY quickly, so finger dexterity was a legit issue for me personally and my hands would actually get tired trying to keep up. This was only fixed with practice to improve.

Bosses on the other hand are the weakest and most frustrating part of the game. They all have a moveset gimmick and hyper armor like 95% of the time which means you're forced to fight them the exact way the devs intended you to fight them, which can be frustrating if your technique isn't nearly perfect. The frustrating part is if even you successfully dodge/parry/avoid say 90% of the time, the times you fail you will quickly build up chip damage to your health and will quickly lose lives, so again it's about mastering the mechanics to survive, and I think most people who comes from a Soulsborne gaming history will be very humbled by this game unless you choose to stick with it and persevere.

OMG!  I love these mindless action games. . .   The combat is really fluid and looks like authentic pac mei kung fu (sp?).  I watched a mini-doc on the making of this amazing game and I was impressed by how much thought and care went into making this game's combat mechanics and environments look as authentic as possible, not realistic mind you, only authentic.  Nobody has the kind of stamina and cardiovascular endurance that the main character has -- that's just too unrealistic.  It would be realistic, on the one hand, if the devs employed some kind stamina system in order to make it more challenging and realistic -- the main character that you control is just too overpowered once you figure out the timing on parrying attacks.  Avoiding attacks by dodging or slipping with head movement is easy to do but it isn't as effective as parrying attacks and that there is the key to mastering the game.  Parrying seems almost impossible at first until you eventually figure out the timing window for it.

The story is fantastic, and uses some very simple design choices to give a lot of replayability to what would otherwise be a rather short title. There's a scoring mechanic, which alone would scratch an itch for many, giving a reason to go again and do better. Furthermore, however, some of the bonuses/stat buffs you can grab are locked behind a score wall, which is a great trick to get you go through a level again in attempt to meet the requirements for that one bonus you'd really like to have early on. 

Then, once you've beaten the game, and really feel like you've mastered it, you're given a whole new incentive to try again; this time, can you do it WITHOUT  taking the easy road and defeating your foes? I won't spoil anything, but there is definitely more to the game than just ""winning,"" and the moment you feel like a master it will ask you to prove it. It really is the kind of challenge that humbles the ego you'll likely build from your initial victory, and has additional story beats to go along with that challenge that coincide with that feeling. The message it delivers is even, dare I say, profound. 

Then... there's the arenas. It truly feels like an entirely different team worked on the arenas than did the story. The arenas seem almost designed to shove the game's primary shortcoming right in your face: character control. So on a player/character control chart, sifu feels like it falls about here: 

[  ] Smash bros melee/project M
[  ] Very high
[  ] High 
[x] above-average
[x] average
[  ] below average
[  ] Low
[  ] abysmal
[  ] auto battler

Which is fine. In fact, story mode creates an illusion of it even being about high or maybe even very high. The reason is thus: you see, when you fight a mob there is no lock on, and pointing the stick toward a particular opponent is more of a suggestion to your character, rather than a command. In story, this isn't such a big deal; ""oops, I wanted to hit that guy, but I guess I'll kick this guy's ass a bit, and break off back to my intended target."" Occasionally there's that one annoying enemy you want to get rid off, but your guy just cannot or will not finish him, instead fighting you (the player) to go after everyone but. However, most encounters are designed so you can go with the flow, and when you hit that zen, it doesn't matter, you just drop whoever is stepping up next, with whatever technique flows from your soul.

In the arena... well... the only way to do certain challenges are to use very specific techniques in very specific ways to achieve very specific results. This is a nightmare, and I died a little inside on my road to 100% this game. I mean, I did it, but... you probably shouldn't. The issue herein being that most advanced techniques in this game involve flicking your stick this way or that before pressing X or Y, and the direction (stated as, for example, ""DOWN then UP"") is dictated by the camera, which often sits at odd angles; great for seeing what is going on, terrible for registering these inputs. The game's descriptions can also be very unclear in conveying how and when to execute certain techniques, compounding the issue. I beat the story in it's entirety without bothering to use most of these wonky input techniques because they were just so unreliable, but the arenas DEMAND them, and it's nothing short of migraine inducing. 

That said, I will recommend the title. It can be a hell of a lot of fun and, like climbing a mountain, offers a rewarding sense of triumph by the end. There's costumes to unlock, some interesting bosses, and it has the vibes of the old 70's kung fu flicks, with a bit of profundity sprinkled on top.

The art-style of the game is amazing. The devs clearly chose a stylistic over a realistic approach, but it works splendidly. Check out the artwork for yourself, it's gorgeous. Every set piece carries a different vibe or emotion. Brilliantly done. 

---{ Gameplay }---
☑ Very good
☐ Good
☐ It's just gameplay

☐ Watch paint dry instead

Infinitely replayable, and I think the best selling point of this game. What starts as something that feels like a button-masher, very quickly becomes quite in-depth. Controls are smooth (although I prefer to play with a controller, don't know for keyboard). No quick-time events, everything you do is purely skill-based, and gameplay is simply fun and becomes more and more intense as you progress.

Beautiful music and it always compliments the scenery, but never overtakes it. Some voices can be a bit tough to hear sometimes, but not during moments where dialogue matters. Perfect music for a kung-fu beat-em-up.

---{ Audience }---
☐ Kids
☑ Teens
☑ Adults
☐ Grandma

Game's too hard for kids or your grandma. The game is violent, but without gore. Perfect for those who like kung-fu movies and enjoy watching your character beat people up. Good times. 

---{ PC Requirements }---
☐ Check if you can run paint
☐ Potato
☑ Decent
☐ Fast
☐ Rich boi
☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer

You don't need an insane computer, but you should ensure your pc runs this game smoothly. Timing is important for this title, and in my playthrough I've experienced some input lag or stuttering, which can be annoying when this game is all about timing. 

---{ Difficulty }---
☐ Just press 'W'
☐ Easy
☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master
☐ Significant brain usage
☑ Difficult
☐ Dark Souls

This game clearly takes inspiration from Sekiro in terms of combat (counter or dodge, or get punched in the face), but positioning, the right skills and being aware of your surroundings gives this game a more rogue-like approach than Sekiro and makes the levels somewhat easier to breeze through. There's also different difficulties if you find this game too hard (or easy, but I'm sure most people agree this is a tough game). Definitely made for the hardcore gamer, don't introduce new players to the world of gaming with Sifu. The death mechanic is interesting, because it makes dying frustrating, but not as frustrating as Sekiro. 

---{ Grind }---
☐ Nothing to grind
☑ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks
☐ Isn't necessary to progress
☐ Average grind level
☐ Too much grind
☐ You'll need a second life for grinding

Although there are skills to unlock and side-goals to complete, the game itself doesn't require any grinding. Only for those who're looking to complete achievements. The grind IS the gameplay, just punch away and you'll start unlocking things automatically. Deluxe edition offers some cosmetics, but IMO they're not worth it.

---{ Story }---
☐ No Story
☐ Some lore
☐ Average
☐ Good
☑ Lovely
☐ It'll replace your life

Typical revenge story, but very well told. Cutscenes are always interesting, any other story telling is weaved in the scenery while you browse through the levels. Smart decision of the devs here; you only get to know your enemies better once you start paying attention to the visual cues in your surroundings rather than running straight past them. 

---{ Game Time }---
☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee
☐ Short
☑ Average
☐ Long
☐ To infinity and beyond

Finishing the entire story took me about 10 hours, finding the 'hidden' ending took me another 5 and the arena sidequests will keep you occupied for another good 10-15 hours. Yet, the game has solid repeatability and side-goals to encourage you to replay the game. Most players will probably spend around a max of 30-40 hours, completionists could go up to 60-70 hours. I think if the game would have been longer, it would become boring. It's a perfect length for a roguelike. Don't expect 200-hour open-world, but the levels you play in all do feel like their own world thanks to the art-style. 

---{ Price }---
☐ It's free!
☑ Worth the price
☐ If it's on sale
☐ If u have some spare money left
☐ Not recommended
☐ You could also just burn your money

Although I think 40 is a bit steep for this title (I'd be more comfortable with 30), the love and devotion the devs have put into this game makes it worth the price. IMO the Deluxe Edition is not worth the money and I'd only get it on sale, but the base game is worth the money. 40 is a lot for a smaller title like this, but the 30 hours I've played have been 30 hours of absolute fun. 

---{ Bugs }---
☐ Never heard of
☑ Minor bugs
☐ Can get annoying
☐ ARK: Survival Evolved
☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs

Most of the game runs smooth like butter. Sometimes camera angles can get a little awkward and beaten enemies can suddenly start rag dolling, but these bugs are rare. In general, this is an incredibly polished game.

Sifu may seem short but its gameplay mechanics is what stretches the gameplay out longer, other than the story mode, the challenges arenas are what really prolongs this game and its intricate and fun gameplay. New game+ exists via the previously mentioned arena/challenges as well as changing or modifying your martial arts moveset as well.

Combat or gameplay itself is simple yet complex at the same time. You get a few set moves that can trigger different things like knocking down an opponent, pushing them further or just generally doing a half dodge and immediate strike. 
- Learning enemy move set matters
- Parry timing matters
- Positioning around mulitple enemies matters
All of these merges into a blend of multiple variance whch makes every fight different

Environments are also really well done and differentiates themselves apart, Soundtracks honestly in my opinion could be more hyped but mostly takes a sombre slow tone to follow its story mode I guess, although the club portions start to ramp up.

Overall, worth the cash even at full price now taking into account how most triple A games have inflated to a average $79-$99.

[i] A Kung Fu action game that truly only shines in 1 category.	[/i]

[b] Pros:	[/b]
+ Music is awesome, very different and unique osts in each area.
+ Loved all the movie references from the outfits to specific moments in the game.
+ Relaxing art style for such an intense game, but didn't alienate the game's selling point.
+ Combat is the main focus and it's of course top notch action, love doing all the combos.

[b] Cons:	[/b]
- Sifu, in all intents and purposes is a beat'em up with roguelike elements, however, the roguelike aspect is so bare-bones I'm left asking myself, ""Why did they even implement this?""
- Despite their disclaimer, if I purchase the cosmetic pack with real life currency I fully expect to have immediate access to those outfits, NOT for them to be locked behind specific conditions post game completion.
- Narrative is a big thing for me and if a game provides any form of that I will suspend disbelief and give it my full undivided attention, but it lacks big time. If the story plays second fiddle to the gameplay then they should've put those resources and time into the Arenas portion of the game and made it the focal point.

[i] Sifu's a great action game, but the roguelike elements are an afterthought and it's narrative sucks. Buy it on sale if you're bored.	[/i]

The whole game is just a love letter to martial arts movies and Chinese culture as a whole(there's full voice acting in both Mandarin and Canto in the game too); the references in this game and the attention to detail in the environments, set pieces and character designs are honestly reason enough alone to play this, but on top of all that they also made one of the most satisfying melee combat systems ever.  If you've played the Arkham games I would compare it to the melee combat there except this game has more meaningful combo strings, more complex defensive options, and animation cancelling tech for combo chaining, and the enemies are much tougher.  

Fair warning though that this game is pretty hard, despite only having 5 main levels which you can eventually run through in a couple minutes each, it took me around 10 hours to beat the game on the recommended difficulty, and another 2 hours to get the true ending.  There is an easy mode which drastically decreases the punishment for dying so I don't think this game would be impossible to beat for someone who sucks at these mechanically demanding types of games but you will 100% get frustrated even if you're a good player - that's intentional though and woven into the themes of the game in a nice harmony of gameplay and narrative.  

Really strong 9/10 for me, and if you think even a little that you might like this game just give it a shot. A tightly designed, complete game with a strong vision that's executed this well doesn't happen often, and is worth experiencing.

The movements are tactile and responsive, and landing the parries and combinations is rewarding. Overall, from the short amount of time I put in, a very polished fighting game that bring in the rogue-lite elements from the genre. The aging system is fun an unique, and while I think the skill system can be a little tricky to get into, taking time to master them and your standard combinations, you'll be a black-belt in ass-kicking kung-fu, Probably one of the better brawlers I've played in some time and with the gameplay style that it achieves, just a great way to enjoy an afternoon.

All that being said, I've got a couple gripes. The first is the difficulty swings harder a bored couple from San Francisco. You go from just wrecking groups of nameless walking stereotypes to getting beaten like a red-headed stepchild in a matter of footsteps. It's all over the place, and there are stronger aforementioned minions that are completely indistinguishable from the standard assortment of target dummies. You won't know until you're suddenly getting your cheeks clapped like your ex while you're at work. There's no way to immediately identify problems and manage the threat reasonably. This leads to a lot of unnecessary deaths. And while fighting a boss and taking a fat L is part of the learning process, you don't learn anything from unfair deaths due to bad design choices. What you do learn is new way to put curses together under your breath towards the devs for this oversight. Also, the stamina bar breaker attacks, which are usually signaled by a glowing limb they want to deliver somewhere between your lungs and colon, are only signaled 0.0001 seconds before you realize it's going to take a surgeon and a Caterpillar crane to remove it from your ass. If you're going to go through the trouble to telegraph attacks I need to dodge instead of parry, then fuckin telegraph them usefully otherwise don't do it at all. 

I still highly recommend this game. Chances are that if you played Sekiro and did well, this game will probably be a bit of a breeze for you. For the rest of us that aren't cocaine-addicted Monster fanatics, don't bother with the hardest difficulty. The first one is a little too easy, and the second one will have you biting a pillow and begging for mercy.",1697950230,1697950230,True,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

At first the aging system sounds really cool and thematic, until you realize that it's a hard limit on the number of times you die. And not just in a single stage -- which are quite long and comprise multiple mini-bosses and setpiece brawls, topped off by a multi-stage boss with Sekiro-level attack strings -- but for the ENTIRE CAMPAIGN. If you hit this limit, you can retry the stage, which will put your age back to what it was at the start... but it's entirely possible to get yourself into a position where you have to basically perfect the next level if you died too much on previous stages.

If you want to beat this game on a difficulty that is challenging for you, you will have to restart the game multiple times. In 2023 -- hell, any time after 1994 -- this is just jaw-dropping. It's not a roguelite with persistent unlocks between runs, it's a multi-hour narrative campaign, and I'm assuming you have to do the stages in the same order on every attempt. 

Some people seem to be defending this as being thematic and forcing you to get good at the game, and it does do those things, but it's mostly just padding out the playtime in my opinion. I want to master the combat, but I want to do it by progressing through the story, and maybe returning to specific fights or even doing a full run again. What I don't want to do is be forced to replay the same stages over and over before I can be rewarded with seeing something new, or lower the difficulty to make it less challenging. 

The aging mechanism itself is fine, just let me be a 960 year old martial arts legend. Or better yet, make the unlimited aging and hard cap an optional difficulty add-on, like Ironman mode in other games, because that's what it is.",1697785166,1697787495,False,8,2,0.47492825984954834,0,True,False,False

The quintessential amalgamation of classic martial arts cinema themes, callbacks, and fresh game mechanics. An excellent beat ‘em up with unparalleled polish, every aspect of the game is so finely composed. You can feel the intention, focus and passion that went into its development. The artistic direction is beautiful, with an excellent aesthetic making every set piece look like a painting. It’s a great example of stylized graphics providing a timeless look, and lessening the burden on hardware by not striving for needless realism.

Deciding against realism in favor of style does not mean the game’s environments lack detail. Every level is packed with well-thought environments, and a very enjoyable amount of clutter for the area. Better yet, Sifu takes its beautiful style and creates some amazing set-pieces. The levels are such a treat to fight through. Without spoiling much, each level is a boss’s hideout, and you’re on a path of revenge, punching and kicking your way through waves of their goons. The hideouts very much reflect the personality of the boss and are relevant to their occupation. There’s a lot of subtle environmental storytelling in Sifu (as well as easter eggs hidden throughout the levels that expose more). This would be enough to impress, but every level has a distinct soundtrack that fits the theme and feeling, creating some very powerful atmospheres. The environments paired with this banger soundtrack really elevate the experience and make it feel truly cinematic.

The animation is so fluid that I find it jarring going back to most games, even AAA titles. A lot of games feel very stiff in comparison. This fluid and dynamic animation seamlessly transitions your attacks. This is an impressive feat, as though Sifu doesn’t have an unbearable amount of possible attacks, there is a wide variety of basic moves creating a lot of potential combos, and the animation system blends every single one perfectly into the next. It even accounts for the same moves done in different environments, which can determine how the finishing blow is dealt. This isn’t unique to Sifu, but it’s rare, and Sifu does it well.

Sifu has a unique resurrection mechanic that is built into its story. Upon death, you can resurrect at the cost of a few years of your life. You age every time you fail until you reach any age above 70, at which point you’ll be on your last life. If you die for good, you start over. This is a key part of Sifu’s difficulty, forcing the player to learn and improve, coming out of levels younger and younger, perfecting the art of each level and obstacles to be overcome. Thankfully, the youngest age you complete a level at will always be saved for convenience. If you manage not to die for two levels for example, you can always just start from the latter level for your next attempt. Though the story is nothing revolutionary, it serves as an excellent canvas for your classic tale of revenge often told in kung-fu classics, helping bring those themes to life. It's an elegantly told story. Everything feels intentional and you can tell the developers communicated greatly, ensuring every aspect of the game is cohesive. The outcome of your journey can change in a way that is very heartfelt, depending on some of your choices. These choices aren’t made obvious to the player, and I won’t delve into them, but you can technically get a different ending and we’ll leave it at that. 

There’s a lot of incentive to replay the game’s main story, whether it be to flex your skill and come out unscathed, never aging, as you flawlessly master every encounter, or to discover the secrets in each level that sometimes unlock items used to access areas in previous levels. The game is designed with the intention of you replaying it a lot, but not through irritating grindy mechanics, rather the natural incentive to improve and uncover more of the story for those curious. Additionally, there’s an entire separate mode in the game called Arenas, with a massive amount of new levels and challenges to overcome, providing even more replay value and a lot of extra quality content. I could easily see some players not even bothering with the main story, and just having fun playing through one-off scenarios in Arenas, though I’d highly recommend not even touching Arenas until you’ve beaten the main game. 

So, you’ve got this $40 indie game with a level of polish and presentation unparalleled by most games, with fun beat-em up action, excellent enemy AI, a lot of replayability, and genuine challenge that you overcome as you ‘git gud’. This is one of the easiest recommendations I can ever make, as I really think anyone can enjoy this game if they have a little bit of patience for learning how to not suck at it. Nothing feels tedious either, a big part of whether I personally can stomach a game's difficulty and stay interested. No question in my mind if you’re a fan of martial arts cinema, it's essential you give this game a shot. Buy it.

[h2] ""One epitaph for Clover Studio: We made one of the best games of all time and it was just a game about punching people."" [/h2]

[b] SIFU [/b] is definitely without any doubt one of the best modern beat 'em ups to date. 

This game took Batman Arkham's freeflow combat and made the countering, dodging, and the punching and kicking more deliberate and as technical as your standard 2D fighting game.

This game is styling, visually and mechanically. The thematic imageries throughout the five stages are a feast, especially at the middle chunk of the game's main campaign. I never got tired of them. I did get used to them, but I'll never say they're boring. This game is quite the cultural exhibit, in every sense of the word. 

Mechanically; combo strings, pause combo, charge attacks, directional dodge, directional throws, follow-ups, sweeps, environmental interactions, takedown finishers, and dash attacks.
This game has all of those, and they all work together really well.
They even use a scoring system similar to Devil May Cry's, but the game isn't going to tell ya about it up front, cheeky little bastard.

The game feels good to play. It feels good to lose, and it feels very very good to win. Beating the game gave me a good amount of satisfaction, but mastering and understanding the many elements the game throws at you is enlightening. 
It's as good as people say it is.

Oh yeah, the arena challenges are great. They're there to push your limits, and in a roundabout way, a great tool to teach you techniques that most players would've ignored during their main campaign runs. 

The game is [b] GREAT [/b], but it's not perfect. There's slight jank in there, although they're seldom. Here are my findings:

glitches:

main story:
- [spoiler] Yang [/spoiler] stuck in a wall during second phase
- [spoiler] Sean [/spoiler] stuck on object during second phase 
no softlock and was able to resume the battle without restarting

arena:
- enemy spawned out of reach from player (on the roof, in the air)
- player/enemy could stuck in falling animation at the edge of a map
-  this happened once, an enemy just teleport from the lower floor mid jump kick into the player's face


Now, my personal nitpicks
 
- let me toggle the target for focus attack, and maybe make the slo-mo focus menu slightly slower

- enemy seemingly attack from out of frame

- directional input attacks can mess up the soft lock-on targeting, a hard lock-on toggle might help, I'm not sure myself 

- wrestling with the camera sometimes, of course

- game crashes due to physics items went haywire?


From the legendary God Hand combat, to the stellar Arkham freeflow combat, followed by Sleeping Dogs' own version of freeflow combat, then we stumbled a bit with Remember Me's customisable combos, and now Sloclap came in with Absolver and Sifu. 

What're you cooking next, Sloclap? Please just make a Jackie Chan Movie Simulator, man. I'll be there front row seat day one!

- is in my opinion one of the best action games of all times (at least Top 10) and can run against the Titans of the genre (GoW, DMC, Doom, Arkham  etc) with its unique approach of constantly dying and ageing again and again in fast combat scenarios, until you reach the end of a level and finally the end of the game. For me it's one of the best combat systems ever created,  because (when trained enough) the player is in full control of every single move he makes and the flow and feeling of it is incredble, while being threatened with death all the time. It is also the real ""Get good"" game because there are no shortcuts by RPG level up mechanics (looking at you ""Soulslike"" genre). Also ""Easy to learn, but (very) hard to master"" is a description that fits the game very well, because simple and tight button inputs have to be used against pretty tough AI. Of course the Kung Fu Movie style and its settings plus the music round up the whole experience, like a delicate meal accompanied with a fine wine. And the Arena mode is like a very delicious (and big) dessert. 

I also recall the reviews when it was released: ""It's good, but very hard"" was the overall opinon and i am not sure that all reviewers have seen all 5 stages at that time. Remember: after the first month less then 30 % of the regular players had finished the second level (out of 5): ""The Club"" (Shoutout to YouTuber ""Djisso"" who helped many players to overcome some of the bigger hurdles at the beginning). So Sloclap was forced to create the easy mode, to make the game more accessible (this way i even got my girlfriend to fall in love with it) and let beginners at least experience the story of the game as a ""Student"" first, before their real life-long journey as a ""Disciple"" starts, to reach the true heights of Gong Fu and becoming a ""Master"" with Martial Virtues (""WU DE"").

For sure the game was not appreciated enough as Indie ""Game of the year 2022"" contender (maybe the easy mode at release could have made a difference in the perception of the game and its accessiblity). As a evolution and reimagination of the classic Beat'mUp genre, by definition it also didn't fit in the fighting game category either (""Best Combat"" category would be nice). Also as ""Skill Up"" mentioned: ""Sifu was ""THE GAME"": in the week before Elden Ring was released !!!"" Probably in the long term the game will get its recognition (especially for the gameplay and the unique progression system). 

So the gameplay is phenomenal, the only real gripe i have is the unbalanced economy of the challenge/reward system for the outfits and movesets (for your personal Kung fu style) and also for mods and cheats. Modifiers and new moves are to expensive or the rewards are just not big enough to unlock more then a few things.  To get some of the best outfits you need to overcome some ultra-hard challenges (tedious work). It makes no sense to hide all the good stuff behind a narrow reward system. Respect my time: to grind even more and harder for the stuff that should be easy to enjoy after finishing the game is just not fun, i already have a job !!! Just let me play (as free as possible) !!! Don't make me hate the game (and not want to play it anymore) because you show me all the nice stuff, but then lock it behind a wall of tedious work. In this particular area it is just bad game design and an affront to the fans (who just want to enjoy the game) and to all gamers who just play to have fun. It is a big middlefinger right into my face and i have to give this one right back to you, Sloclap !!!

So in this regard Sloclap fumbled the ball right in the endzone to create a perfect game. This is especially sad, because they came so close to make a well rounded experience that everyone could have enjoyed by his own personal preferences.  

I bought the game now the 3rd time on Steam, because the Epic games store version had some problems on the Steamdeck. No regrets there, because Sloclap evolved from ""Absolver"" to ""Sifu"" so much, that on this fundaments and with some tweaks of the reward system (and some insights of what makes a game fun instead of grind) even bigger things are possible and i can't wait to see them.",1680069813,1697496951,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

But after logging in more hours, I've changed my mind; but that doesn't mean I recommend it though. I did have fun. And that's all I can say. However, there are two things that greatly ruin this game for me: the bosses and the combos you unlocked.

Bosses are supposed to be hard, sometimes rage inducing (you will get that a lot), however there is a gripe I have with the boss designs. Imagine playing an RPG and the first boss you face is just some big dude with a sword. You have unlocked some abilities to face him and he has some tricks up his sleeves as well. Then the next boss, you've gotten better and unlocked more abilities, but the boss has also gotten some buffs to make them harder, forcing you to use everything you have learned so far. This is a healthy progressive system where bosses gradually get harder as you, the player, get better. That's not the case for Sifu.

Fajar, the first boss, is like facing Sephiroth instead of the Scorpion Mech in the first area of Final Fantasy 7. He is a tough guy. And as someone who has beaten this game dozens of times, he still trips me up, sometimes managing to kill me. And after you finally beat him, new players will be like, ""Dang! How are the other bosses gonna get harder?"" Not the case, because Sean, the second boss, is a f**king joke. So is the Artist, once you learn her gimmick, and the CEO. Yang is Fajar, only more predictable. So why is Fajar, to me, the hardest boss, but everyone else is a jester? Fajar will mix up his attacks and quickly finish you off with quick blows. Everyone else, even Yang (the final boss), have two or three combos they do, and they don't ever mix them up. They are as predictable as thunder after a lightning strike. You will always be second-guessing yourself when facing Fajar; but everyone else, once you've learned their tiny moveset, will be a cakewalk. Now, enemies do get harder, but bosses are suppose to be big moments in games, a trial to prove yourself that you are ready to take on the next area of the game. I never had that feeling. Once you get past Fajar, you can still have fun, just don't expect the bosses to get any harder.

And finally, the combos you unlock. Now, I'm still learning about combos and chaining them together effectively. But doing so is cumbersome, because enemies will suddenly start to block in the middle of your combos-- which makes sense! No one would just give up and take a beating. But the real kicker is when the game suddenly gives them super armor so that they can deal out there attacks. I hate that. I hate it when a game chucks immersion and realism out the window and gives enemies super armor, but you get none. The only move you get that gives you super armor is the one where you hold block and hold down Y to do a charge attack. And that move sucks! Even if you power through the enemies attack to do the move, you're still f**ked because they still have super armor and they keep going until their animation is over. That sucks the fun out for me. Buff the enemy and nerf the player. I don't like that.

Those are my two biggest gripes about the game. I'm not gonna talk about the Arenas. All I'm gonna say about them is that they can go burn in Hell. I won't miss them. And that's only if you're trying to collect the three stamps in each challenge. 

Despite my gripes, the game is still fun. Even when you look past the boss difficulty and the enemies super armor, it is still a fun game. Don't let my negativity stop you. I'm just telling you what to expect.

My advice to new players: 1. abuse the f**k out of avoids. When you successfully avoid, time will slow down for the enemy, leaving them open for a small combo.
2. When you are facing a ton of enemies at once, create a ""choke point"" by getting into a hallway so that enemies can only come at you one at a time. This prevents them from surrounding you and attacking you all at once.
3. NEVER BE AFRAID TO RETREAT! Sometimes, it's best to put something between you and your opponent so as to give you a breather.
4. DON'T UPGRADE WEAPONS OR FOCUS AT SHRINES! Upgrade only structure and structure recovery first. Blocking is powerful, but don't rely on it too much.
5. Don't do Takedowns. There is a small chance that an enemy will get ""second wind"": they get all their health back. They are harder and faster and relentless. The more enemies you kill, the higher the chance for an enemy to get ""Second Wind"" but only if you do takedowns on them. However, this only works with grunts. It doesn't work with Disciples, Bodyguards, Flashkicks, and Juggernauts; so do takedowns on them all you want.

I grew up playing the arkham games as a kid. and was extremely dissapointed with knight. I thought they simplified the controls, but replaying city made me realise it was only a challenge because my child mind couldn't see I was only pressing 2 buttons.  This game has filled a void that arkham 5 shaped hole in my life.

Everything is great about this game cept for 2 things. 1. the camera, however that was solved by remapping the controls so that I control the camera with the directional buttons on the right.
2. the processing speeds. I inherited a 4k gaming PC, and I feel like it should run this game better. Seems to be more an effort loading the environment then the combat itself. I don't see any reason why I should experience any dips in my frame-rate. Its not like there are unique animations for an opponent on the stairs. 
3. Other; there should be an option to turn off the bars and warnings. so that you rely on the animations for gameplay instead of a meter on the bar. 

Overall its these 2 reasons I'd say $60 is a bit much, this feels more like a $30-40 experience. It lacks that AAA polish making it feel like $70+. Especially since the DLC adds about 50%, and is only valued at $15.

From a gameplay perspective, you've got to approach opponents with a level of respect. Acknowlege that you can't treat them the same and that some will coordinate and use the same abilities as you. Took me a while to realise there was a bar showing your opponents sense of balance. That's because the animations are so detailed you can see when someone is a couple taps away from done.

It is a damn good game for those who like to get their skills tested. 

So, here are the Pros:
- This game teaches you to get good. Keep at it and get better in order to beat the game at a younger age.
- Combat Mechanics are very polished 
- Boss fights are great. Every boss has their signature thing which you need to learn to overcome.
- Unique Permadeath (sort of) concept with the age thing
- Every playthrough is different, there will be no paths which you will unlock
- There is a secret ending. Again you need to get good (and then some) to unlock it

The Cons
- Some of the Challenge Arenas are just bullshit. Nearly impossible to get 3 stamps no matter how hard you try. Yes, I am looking at you dragon arenas.
- To get all achievements, the last few arenas were just a slog to get through. Its the same thing repeated again and again and again. Capture zones, combo score, survival or time attack.

Sifu is a great rogue-like fighting game that emulates old martial arts and Kung-Fu films. If you're up for a challenge this game is going to be very fun.

[b]Positives[/b]
[list]
[*]The combat is both very challenging and extremely rewarding as enemies will test your patience and reaction.
[*]The soundtrack elevates every fight exponentially.
[*]The level design for each of the 5 areas is well thought-out with multiple routes to take, encouraging multiple play-throughs for all of the collectibles.
[*]The art style, graphics, and animations are awesome.
[*]Sifu has multiple endings, allowing players to make decisions throughout a playthrough.
[*]The aging mechanic is unique and rewards/punishes you for dying.
[/list]
[b]Negatives[/b]
[list]
[*]Sifu is short, although there is a lot of side content in the form of challenges and arenas that the developer has added in the final update.
[*]Sifu's camera has a tendency to obstruct the view of enemies. A wider shoulder FOV would have made the combat even better.
[*]Some enemy attacks, like sweeping kicks, are almost unblockable. They're not well telegraphed and take a very quick reaction to successfully avoid. Avoiding attacks in general require tight inputs.
[*]If you play on borderless window sometimes the mouse cursor will get stuck on a different monitor, causing inputs to not properly work.
[*]Inputs are stacked on movement keys for KBM players, which makes them pretty difficult to successfully pull off in the correct amount of time. If possible, play on controller for a better experience.

I mean first off all, the combat is simply beautiful. It draws inspiration from Sekiro: Shadows die Twice, but at the same time SloClap kept in mind that they wanted to create Absolver (their first game) in a much better format. Not a single moment of combat feels dull. You love deflecting? You can deflect the entire game. You love to dodge? You can dodge the entire game without deflecting a single attack. You like judo? Well you can literally use inverted throw or just regular throws to throw people around and manage crowds. There is a little bit for everyone. The finishers feel amazing and they are well mocaped.

The story is ok. I mean its nothing convoluted. Its a pretty straight forward revenge mission from start to finish. The only unexpected twist is [spoiler] the moment that you realize that you can actually spare the bosses and it changes the ending. [/spoiler]

Arenas are A TON OF FUN. You literally compete with yourself to see can you beat your own score. Each Arena is made so that is uses different randomizers. This ensures that not a single mission is going to be the same as the last ones. Its very intuitive.

There are some F bombs thrown around in game. However, the player will more than likely say much worse and more often. I honestly don't know why they included it in game but imo it isn't anything you haven't heard before.

The game wants to be a cool stylish satisfying beat-em-up like the Yakuza games, but also wants to be technical like a normal fighting game (Street Fighter, Tekken and so on). And it fails at both.

The beat-em-up aspect sucks, because the enemies are too smart to actually get beaten up. Example: the game gives you a combo by default consisting of 5 light attacks. I didn't manage to land it once even on regular goons, because they start blocking and counter-attacking after like the third hit. So you cannot go around having fun beating people.

The fighting game aspect sucks as well. The control scheme is very uncomfortable (S, W, attack???); it is hard to differentiate between when you just blocked an attack or when you parried it both visually and sonically; your enemies have attacks with different properties. It all makes the combat very confusing. It could work if there were less enemies, but encounters generally have either multiple enemies, or enemies with weapons, and don't get me started on bosses of which I have seen just one so far and am not sure I would care to play more. The game simply comes down to you finding the most efficient (boring) tactic and abusing it.

In case you want to tell me to get good, I have been playing fighting games competitively for a long time, and have played Dark Souls 1-3 as a Soul Level 1 character. All these were much more fun than Sifu.

The visuals seem like the devs wanted to have them stylized, but they look simply poor for a game released at this time and age. The animations are pretty smooth though, I like them. The music is boring and repetitive. The story is almost non-existent.

If you want a game with cool combat where you go toe-to-toe with your enemies, parry their blows and then hit them, I wholeheartedly recommend Sekiro instead of this.

-upd-
Next day I tried playing it on the easy difficulty. Zero fun. Didn't even bother completing and uninstalled. And I'm upset about this because right before Sifu I have played a game ""The Way"", which was made by a tiny indie team, and it is better than this game made by a whole studio.

For me the problem starts with the game just begin to hard. Yeah i know skill issue, git gut, jadajadajada we all heard it a million times, but Sifu in my opinion is just too unforgiving. I started on normal and i got frustrated so hard after two levels so i started on easy and suddenly the game was just too easy. The difficulty spike from easy to normal is just ridiculous! On normal you get punched to death in a sec and on easy you complete the whole game in 2 hours under the age of 25 so Sifu doesnt find the right balance here. You could argue that the audience for the game are people that love hard games, but games like Dark Souls or Devil May Cry fight just the sweet spot between those difficulties. These games are never too hard or too easy. Sifu just cranks it up, tells you to fcking git gut or get the hell outta here. The counters have to be frameperfect. Why? Just because you make it hard by default it doesnt get better, its just more annoying for players who just wants to have a good time playing fighting games but Sloclap just wants the elite players who are willing to die a million times to make it to end on hard or get three stars on every challange. 

Some of the challanges are just utterly unfair! If you make a single little mistake, your three star rating is gone. Sifu just wants to punish you for the sake of punishing you, nothing else to it. Sit through the suffering or look for another game is Sifu philosophy.

Sometimes i had the issue that my inputs were not read correctly, i checked the controls, did everything like the menu told, i checked YouTube and volla it turns out you have to counter or evade to throw. What kind of design is that? You show me the wrong input and dont even explain. Yea Yeah i hear you, just go to the training arena and practice. But i just dont want to practice in a arena, i want to play the story and enjoy the combat but Sifu just tries to kill you at every corner by either begin too hard, no explaing the basics properly or by just punishing the tiniest mistakes.

Achievements were luckly easy to obtain because since the final update they broke a lot of them so they just unlocked without me even doing the requirments. Thats fine for me i guess so i dont have to play the game ever again.

I only recommend this game to people who punishment at their workplace is not enough and want to sit through it after they got home. If you just want to enjoy a fighting game with good combos, go for Devil May Cry or any other fighting game. Hitting top 500 in Street Fighter 6 is easier and goes faster than completing this game on the hardest difficulty.

For a studio that has only made two games thus far they have a respectable reputation in the industry already but they completly lost me with this one and i am not excited for any other projects from the team.

I didnt hate my time with Sifu but the negatives are just more than the positives in this game. Shame because i really wanted to like it. Guess i go back to casual stuff (me bad gamer, git gut Smadge)",1695046799,1695047052,False,3,0,0.465753406286239624,0,True,False,False

◘ Camera is garbage.
◘ Lighting is garbage. Lots of places where you can't see anything.
◘ Moveset is garbage. The animations are nice and punchy, but the moveset is not.
◘ Parry-frames are too tight. One-on-one they are more-less fine, but where you got a one-on-one here? All fights are 2-6+ enemies and these tight frames do not work with that camera.
◘ One-way bosses/enemies - my beloved garbage game mechanics, you MUST fight them only as devs intended. You have a whole arsenal of moves and abilities - well, they don't work now, just a waste of time ( Hello, Sekiro ). Not all enemies are like that and that is even worse because you are getting used to building your own style of play and at some point, the game just takes away all of that.
◘ Enemies don't have ability cooldowns - they can spam kicks that will break your meter with ease. And bosses have the same problem.
◘ 4 (!!!) actions on one button, this is not a mech simulator! Devs, you already have an evade button, why do another one with GUARD + DOWN? And another specific one with GUARD + UP... to EVADE a DOWN ATTACK ( you can't change this in settings, btw )?! This clusterfack of actions leads to wrong input executions.
◘ When you get into the flow - this game can be a nice experience, just to ruin all on bad game design and clustered input manager.
◘ Abilities that do not work or are just a waste of time. Why do I need a Leg Swipe supermove when I can use a default Eye Poke + Low Kick + Ground Finish? And then I can go for another Low Kick + Ground Finish = More damage while invincible.
◘ Why do I need 4+ hit combos? Most of the enemies will parry me on the 3 hit or die in 2. And you will have a STRONG + HOLD + STRONG move that is safe, fast, and chips away their meters.
◘ Try to Parry the boss, then go Low Kick + Ground Finish + Low Kick + Ground Finish + Eye Poke ( that must stun him ) and he will 100% evade/parry your next Low Kick - because of devs. Yes, this is a cheesy combo but still need a skill to execute the sequence near frame perfectly just to get a big ""No-no, you are playing this game wrong.""
◘ You get a training mode where you can fight with the selected opponent to learn his moves - great! But why the arena is just all RED in the most eye-irritating way? I must learn here, not burn my retina!
◘ Why this game is 20+GB? Mass Effect 2 and 3 are 15 GB - massive cinematic RPGs. And this is just a short arena style ( try to ) beat-em-up with stylised graphics - must be around 6-8 GB max.

If you want to look at good close combat execution - look at the GODHAND. Yes, the movement is a bit tanky, but you have a lot of control and freedom there ( and the game is still difficult af. )

Read a lot of things that read ""Absolver walked so Sifu could run,"" and that triggered my fragile ego so hard that I had to write this. Absolver's combat system is much deeper than Sifu. Sifu is not a bad game. Absolver even in it's current dead state is ultimately more enjoyable because of the customization of fighting styles, and the ability to actually fight your friends.

Combined with unlockable shortcuts It seems to basically allow you to brute force your way through the story to some degree.
I only played a little less than 2h in total so I really suck at the game and yet I was able to take a shortcut on my second run and by doing so be young enough when arriving at the first boss fight and did actually beat him, although I died 5 times in that fight alone iirc. So I felt no reward what soever by beating the first boss in the game...

I would have to play more to make up my mind about this game, but I simply can't.
The reason I can't is that you can just ignore this game's Steam Deck verified status, which is currently ""playable"".
This game IS NOT PLAYABLE. In the above mentioned 2h I had 7 crashes on my Linux Desktop (Ubuntu 23.04), trying Proton 8.0.2, Experimental and Hotfix. So I didn't even bother trying on my Steam Deck.
Not sure if anyone is working on a solution for this.

Will be happy to update my review, once I'm actually able to play this game without the constant crashes.

Fun, neat idea, worthy attempt, but if you're a beat-em-up or unarmed combat (in video games, I stress; I'm not a COMPLETE douche) connoisseur, it won't take long to notice it's not as tight as it thinks it is. The trouble is that it comes maddeningly close a lot. Speaking as someone who plays Street Fighter semicompetitively, I can *see* the desynced animations v impacts. 

But sometimes it comes together and you do weave in between three or four enemies, kicking them out of the furball/killing them as fast as they can come in, and somebody hucks a bottle at your head, which you catch and break over the head of some goon. That feels great.

But then you also have enemies reliably doing the exact same one-two, one after another, in groups of 7-12, and it's very clearly compensating for filling enemy's poise bars, trying to displace your focus/damage. It's not difficult, it's tedious, and more than that, it feels fake.

And then other times your mostly-wearing-black character will be fighting also-mostly-wearing-black enemies in a literally black void. The game does a decent amount of artsy stuff, in one case inside a literal art museum, but a lot of times it comes at the cost of gameplay, whether through readability or otherwise fucking with perspective.

I found the boss fights too prescriptive to be enjoyable. There's very clearly a script you're supposed to be following, when honestly the most fun I had was jumping on top of the dumb losers trying to solemnly challenge me to a duel, and stomping their teeth in before stealing THEIR weapon and beating them to death with it. Less of that in the boss fights. After boss 2, it kept feeling like fighting Stalfos in Ocarina: just waiting for their attacks to be over, dodging and parrying at all the right times, counterattacking the CORRECT number of times, and then back to waiting.  Even your Supers, the focus moves, don't change it too much. The problem's made worse by the fact that the technical tightness isn't there (for me; let it be known that it can EASILY be done, it can be memorized if nothing else, I'm just saying the feel I'm looking for isn't here). It forces you to depend on a mechanic that doesn't have the anims, models, and hit/hurtboxes aligned. 

But I know I'm being unfair. It's not like these guys were working with a Capcom or Arcsystemworks budget.

It's neat, but if you're love a really good, technically-concrete beat-em-up, this isn't it. If you want an arcade kung fu movie homage, it's all right. I got through it faster than I hoped I would and it just never consistently clicked with me.

I'd really prefer there being a 'meh' option, but this is at least meh+; it's more good than bad.

What bothers me is that there are MAYBE about 12 or so combinations in the game give or take a few unlockables. I am bothered, i suppose at what could have been if the devs just added a kick button.

Firstly, it has the ""rpg elements"" of gaining experience points and using them to unlock skills/upgrade your character. Except it's pointless. The unlocked moves are all unnecessary and do not help you. The combat system is not designed around unleashing your cool moves against the enemy. Its designed around defending/avoiding/guardbreaking and then punishing. So all the moves you can get are just flashy options and not utility at all. I thought the purpose of gaining experience and leveling a character was to feel like a badass by the end because of all your power. Like in Shadow of Mordor. By the end of this game, I had the same health, same damage, and still relied on the same moveset I began with. And I beat it.

Also, I do not know what the ideal ""parry window"" is for me but some games parrying feels great like Blasphemous or even Wo Long. And it's not rewarding like Dark Souls, it's more like Sekiro. You are just filling up their ""kill me"" bar. And a lot of the enemies later just feel like punch sponges. For constructive criticism, they should have made the parrying/avoiding has a bigger window and the enemies, like in Sekiro and Wo Long, could have had a reason to land multiple deathblows/executions. I think that would be way more.

All this to also point out that I only beat it on easy (Student). Hilarious considering I love Soulslikes and Roguelikes. It honestly hurts me to negatively review this game because I love martial arts, love roguelikes, love soulslike, and its moddable. But its just not well executed gameplay-wise.

Pros 
- interesting new mechanics which aren't wildly used
- a good art style which suites the tone of the game
- good pacing difficulty wise as the enemies and bosses don't feel like the're suddenly impossible to beat

Cons
- ik that this might seem biased but i cant think of think of anything that is straight up bad about this game

Possibly devisive parts
- the game-play is responsible and extremely satisfying to play (but it takes being beaten a good couple of times to get used to and eventually 'git gud'
- there is only 5 areas/missions for the main story, but they are all different and give off distinct and interesting vibes

There aren't that many and they aren't long, but every single one has an insane amount of attention to detail. I love how the levels connect with each other through the items you pick up. For example: to 100% complete level 1 you need an item out of level 5 which makes replaying the levels really not that tedious. Finally, the combat system is some of the best I've encountered.

As someone that doesn't really care for fighting games and rogue-lites, somehow Sifu caught my attention. You're a martial art young adult that ages when you die. A cool mechanic in many ways. As you get older you can take less hits, but deal more damage.

You unlock new moves through XP earned from fighting a variety of enemies and bosses. The kicker is when you get too old and finally die permanently, you start from the very beginning of the game, [i]or the youngest you were at a certain level[/i]. This sounds harsh, but it's not as daunting as it sounds. You do lose combos learned unless you spend enough to keep them forever. If you’re good enough you won’t ever need to do this. I was not.


I would say the game can take 10-20 hours to depending on how fast your reflexes are. I felt the game was insane with it's reaction time requirements,but got used to it after a few hours.

The other optional feature Sifu has that makes it even more unique and where the bulk of my time was spent.Well, I made an entire video talking about it:

If you were looking for a combat game that lets you be the star of a martial arts film, this is it. Be warned though, this aint some button masher like the Arkham games. You gotta know your combos and when to deploy your more advanced moves. You wanna be the Kung Fu Hero? You gotta play Sifu.
----
Additional thoughts, which may be more of a guide, but I feel any prospective purchaser should be aware:
Keep your focus - You will get your butt kicked, repeatedly. The temptation will be to lose your cool and come back up button mashing. Don't.
Check your sense of honor - There are ten people in a room looking to kill you. You think it's unfair to use a weapon when they have none? Then you're dead. Bruce Lee faced off 20 unarmed goons in 'Enter the Dragon' with nunchucks for this reason. You're here for revenge, not to uphold a sense of honor.
Be aggressive  - Don't wait for enemies to come to you. If there's a room full of goons and one of them has their back turned to you, take that goon down without warning!
Don't play defense - This game learns from your moves. Come out swinging and parry only when you need to. If you use the same combo of strikes in succession, the enemies will counter it in short order. Keep them guessing and on their toes.
Repeat the first level - do this until you can walk into the club with 3 or more lives. 
Step away and come back - Frustrated? Take a break and come back to the game when you can keep your composure and aren't bored of repeating a level. This game is about training and honing skills. Sometimes you need to take a break for this to be effective.",1693966539,1694151238,True,1,0,0.527559041976928711,0,True,False,False

originally i was going to write that the teep that enemies throw is sometimes too fast and undodgeable but now once again this game has proved to me that is 100% ZERO BS and its all your fault cuz i just beat the first level taking 0 damage with the master outfit on master difficulty 
this is one of the best fighting games of all time, for sifu 2 all i ask is to incorporate more combos and maybe even some more complications on harder difficulty like advanced stances, low stances, etc, sifu made me player the devs earlier game absolver just to get a little window into their creative brains and its all just oozing in some of the best controls ever
every negative review is almost entirely ZERO SKILL people. if you like games with 0 jank this is for you, its become my main autism sink for the past 6 months, steam release + epic i probably have 140+ hours on this game and i just got it in december, i dont even wanna know how high its gonna be by this december
also arenas are cool but get old after you 100% them, pls add DLC fully fleshed out levels, esp using some of the environments from the arenas gamemode
i love you devs please make more games like this im begging you
edit 9/7/23
the devs did everything i asked for, insane amount of new arena content including a lot of new maps and remixes of other levels as well, since this is the last update for sifu, i do hope there is sifu 2

-do not want to spend your valuable free time repeating the same level over and over
-are the type to throw controllers / rage quit when faced with frustrating levels on a game

If you are not one of the types mentioned above, and you are a fan of the kungfu films in general, i highly recommend trying Sifu out. It's a high octane gaming experience, requiring even faster reaction time than for Sekiro. You will try, you will die, you will rise. And just as you thought youre getting the hang of it, the opponents on the very next room will do their best to humble you. And they adapt to your moves, discouraging you from abusing one particular combo over and over, there is no comfort zone for you. 

What have i got in 4 hours of gameplay? 2 levels. merely 2 levels and countless bruises. But I'm happy about it. I always feel like it's my fault for dying, that i couldve done better. I never feel cheated or cheesed by the enemy AI. So neither should you. Every time you die, buy some skills, get up and be ready to throw hands again.

Of course Sifu and those two are completely different, considering the former is a single-player brawler and the latter two are one on one PVP fighters. Yet, the combat in Sifu showcases a lot of similarity with those fighting games: it requires the player to pay close attention to enemies' move sets and deflect/avoid/parry accordingly; it has some simple combo inputs which allow the player to chain a series of attacks before the enemy recovers; it also punishes the player who just mashes buttons. As a result, Sifu has quite a deep learning curve. Knowing which attack you should parry and which you should dodge can be very frustrating for new player. Not gonna lie, when I finally beat the first stage, I've already reached the age of 63(and the game caps around 78). But once you master all the technique and remember all the attack patterns, you become a total one-man army that demolishes any foes standing in your way, just like in action movies.

[h1]Things I Like About Sifu:[/h1]

[b]1. One-on-one And Group Fight[/b]
Personally, I prefer the one-on-one fights because I believe those demonstrate the game's core mechanic the best. That's being said, group fights also have their own merits and satisfaction.
→[b]One-on-one[/b]: these fights are usually reserved for elites and bosses, hence are also the reason why I consider Sifu a single-player fighting game experience. Elites and bosses have a variety of combo chains that players need to learn and adapt fast, or else they will meet their untimely death, fast as well. Like fighting games, every attack can land on different position(Overhead, High, Mid, and Low) and has different timing. Players need to react to the attack by either parrying or avoiding it. Luckily the system has been simplified comparing to fighting games: all of the Overhead, High, and Mid can be parried at the right interval, and Low needs to be avoided. My biggest trouble is that some of them have fast High-Low mix-up that I always mess up. This may seem overwhelming at first, but overtime you will learn their move sets. You will find out that every attack is punishable, and you can easily turn the tide by disrupting their momentum. Then, it is your time to be aggressive, executing all the combo to deal the most structure damage. This exchange process between you and the enemy is really satisfying.
→[b]Group fights[/b]: now on the other hand, group fights require a slightly different mentality. The closest gameplay I can reference is that of Sleeping Dogs. You still need to parry and avoid attacks, except that now situational awareness plays a major role in the fight. Deduce which target should be prioritized. Use ledge and items to your advantage. Pushing enemies off the ledge deals an absurd amount of damage. Baseball bat and knife are always better than you bare hands simply because they deal significantly more structure damage. Throwing bricks and bottles basically means free beat-down section. And finally, pushing enemies around. This strategy is important. Slamming enemies into each other can create more breathing rooms, while slamming them into walls can disarm them fast and build more structure damage. Even through group fights can be hectic and unpredictable, you cannot deny the satisfaction of smoothly dispose several enemies in a quick succession.

[b]2. Other Compliments[/b]
→A rather clean and pretty art style.
→Quite a few of cool move sets to unlock.
→The game features light exploration for lore.
→Arena challenges are fun and full of references.

[h1]Things I Dislike About Sifu:[/h1]

[b]1. Rouguelite/like-like Upgrade Features Would Be Lovely[/b]
This is more of a suggestion.
I think the dragon statue upgrades throughout each stage can use some adjustments. Currently, they function as stat boosting, with some restrictions. Basically if you pass a certain age, have a lower score, or earn less XP, some upgrades will be locked for the rest of the playthrough. To me these requirements seems to be a little overkill considering Sifu is already a really punishing game. You lose score multiplier when you get hit or are playing passively. You age faster with each subsequent death, and some skills are also locked behind a certain age. What I would like to suggest about is that maybe change the dragon statue bonuses to three random buff players can choose from: one for stat-boosting, one for strengthening some of the core mechanics, and the other for utility. The buff can last the whole stage or right until the boss fight. The idea behind this roguelite/like feature is to slightly alleviate the steep learning curve of the game. Of course players should still get themselves familiar with the core mechanics and overcome the challenges the game throw at them, but at least the statue bonus can give them a glimmer of hope for success instead of a constant reminder that they suck at the game.

[b]2. Other Complaints[/b]
→Achieving Wude by sparing the five main bosses while killing hundreds of their lowlies, will never not be funny to me.
→I wish avoid can build as much structure damage as parry.

→師父這款遊戲擁有簡易的格鬥遊戲骨子，但學習過程可不比格鬥遊戲簡單。
→讀招、格擋、架招、迴避、追擊、連擊，每場戰鬥都在考驗的你的手眼協調和反應。
→多多練習，你就能像葉問一樣大喊我要打十個！
→個人覺得單挑是這個遊戲的精華，彼此的拳腳相向及過招充分體現遊戲的核心機制。
→打群架也同樣有趣，運用環境和道具，甚至是敵人本身來創造優勢，成功一對多。
→畫風簡單卻不失美感。
→多樣連擊可供解鎖。
→遊戲運用輕度探索來交代角色背景故事。
→個人覺得龍雕像可以改成隨機選擇一項升級類似Roguelite/like遊戲常有的，這遊戲已經對新手極度不友善了(玩不好分數低經驗少、死太多次老太快會鎖技能和升級)，在關卡中獲得暫時性升級至少可以舒緩一下挫敗感。
→只要你赦免五位老大，殺再多手下都沒差，你還是有武德之人。

The Structure/Focus systems are neat, they encourage equal amounts of dodging and parrying. The combat system is unique but those who have experience in the likes of Devil May Cry, Ninja Gaiden and the Arkham/Shadow of Mordor/Spider-Man combat systems will feel somewhat at home. I've heard comparisons to FromSoftware's Sekiro but I have not played this title at time of writing. 

Structure is basically a defense gauge and you can deplete that of your enemies by attacking and parrying them which will enable a health-restoring takedown. Focus is generated by landing attacks and dodging successfully and you can spend Focus on special moves that do extra damage or create favorable situations e.g. knocking an enemy to the ground, stunning them, or shoving them away. Even bosses have Structure, and you will generally defeat them by using takedowns on them twice, as depleting their health is a far less viable method of winning. 

The main standout mechanic apart from the combat system is Aging; which occurs every time you die and continue. Your age, starting from 20, will increase by the number on your death counter, which of course increases with each subsequent death, with permadeath taking place if you die at or above age 70. You decrease it by defeating elite enemies or enduring phases of boss battles. With this mechanic it is possible to ""snowball"" into a loss with repeated deaths, unless you revert back to previous levels (starting at the age you were when you entered them previously) and try to beat them without taking as many years off your life to improve your chances of completing the entire run. 

You earn upgrades from defeating enemies and finding jade statues and lose access to these upgrades as you age (at each 10 year milestone e.g. 30, 40, ..., 70) as well as reduced health, but you do increased damage with higher age brackets. You can prevent yourself from losing these upgrades whilst aging by upgrading them multiple times.

The snowball thing I mentioned makes it easy to be punished early for poor play, but it does encourage you to improve. The game certainly wants you to play it again and again and it is not that long. I'd give it an 8/10. 

P.S. the game also features both Mandarin and Cantonese voice tracks in addition to English. The PC performance is stellar as well as the graphics are pretty stylized and not that fancy.",1693922174,1694000991,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is not a button mashing game. Enemies even on the easy level wont take long to gang you and not ""wait their turn"", so distance keeping and moving is the key.

Low-poly no-texture aesthetic isn't usually my thing, but it works here.  There are negatives, but they aren't insurmountable.

The biggest design flaw is probably the camera.  Like most 3rd person camera games, Sifu's auto-positioning is imperfect, occasionally positioning the camera such that you can't see yourself, your enemies, or perhaps both.  It's easy to control and bring it back around, but doing so means you aren't attacking, which means you're probably dying.

Otherwise, my only complaint so far is the density if enemies in certain spots.  You'll spend a lot of time continuously countering as 4, 5, or 6 enemies surround and attack you while more wait in the wings, and when you're countering -- again -- you're not attacking.

Though you should get ready to knuckle down and learn your parries.

The dungeons or ""hideouts"" all have their unique theme and visual charm, and sometimes  have secondary or optional paths. Almost soulslike-ish you will unlock shortcuts to later parts of the level, so that each future run in a hideout (or dungeon) effectively brings you closer to it's final boss.

The age mechanic is cool, but I could see some people taking issue with having to grind the dungeons over and over for a better continue score / chance at the next dungeon.

Biggest letdown though is that the bossfights get worse every time.
The first actual boss is a nice fair challenge, with a good pace and ebb/flow of pressure between you and the bad guy.
The second is still a good boss, even if kindy easily cheesed by hyperfocusing one strategy.
third & to a lesser extent forth bosses are awfully frustrating & cheese-worthy for attack range & telegraphing related reasons.
Final boss is a right shi[i][/i]tter... it's basically a ""100% perfect parry or loose"" fight - which is cool if you get it right, but [i]extremely[/i] frustrating if you don't.
What's worse is that bosses literally ignore most of the mechanics - all the command attacks, grabs and specials you unlock through XP do dick all against these guys, so you're back to basic parry & waiting for a counter window. Might as well not bother with the rest and just spend my time perfecting those skills...

You'll be doing all kinds of awesome stuff, punching thugs inside an abandoned apartment complex and tossing people of windows, only to jump out of said window into another apartment complex only to deck 3 baddies in the head with a spinning back kick, there are also many kinds of enviroments to punch people at like a night club, inside a skyscraper, at a museum exhibit and so on.
The game does have a fighting game style movelist, but aside from a few key moves that you'll be using, you won't need to read a book to learn all the moves, besides the game provides a very practical tutorial that you can use anytime at your hub area

The game will ease you into the gameplay with a very great intro sequence, ending with a tutorial styled as a cinematic opening to a Martial Arts movie, THIS GAME IS AWESOME and i can't stress that enough!

The Story is about a boy (or girl you can pick) who has had their father killed by a group of mysterious individuals led by a man named Yang, you shortly play as him through the intro sequence to show how powerful and intimidating he is, along with his friends.
Having his father killed in his own dojo and infront of him, the boy (or girl) will swear to [b]kill[/b] Yang and every one of his goons, and by the end of it, John Sifu will learn the true price of revenge. (thats not his real name i made it up :3)

The Gameplay is undeniably difficult compared to other games of its kind, the game does have a difficulty setting so i would reccomend it regardless of you not being a fan of hard games, the game provides a Sekiro style revive mechanic, allowing you to beat the crap of whoever just got you killed, and unlike sekiro, you can die as many times as you like!
but there's a catch, the more you die, the older you get, and the older you are, the less health you will have but you will also deal more damage to compensate, the age of your character carries on from stage to stage however so you may have to repeat a stage if you are not good enough to survive a tough boss at age 70 (the highest possible age you can have before a Game Over), though it may not be for everyone, the process re-doing a stage only to get through tough sections on a stage and smack the shit of enemies that previously got you from college debt (age 20) to midlife crisis (age 50) is unspeakably satisfying!


To conclude: The game demands constant attention and any reckless spam WILL get you killed, but as with actual Martial Arts through patience and most importantly practice, you will experience a game unlike any other!

Here's where I think it went wrong. The developers had some really fun gameplay on their hands but only 5 short levels. A game like this taking 3 hours to beat would be fine so long as there were incentives to do multiple runs. However, the devs weren't okay with the length, so they turned to their only option of  making it really hard, but they didn't want to just challenge their players, they wanted to completely decimate them. What they ended up with was Sekiro without checkpoints. They give you a limited number of lives but that comes with a caveat; the game also punishes you for losing lives. Deaths start to snowball into more deaths because your max health decreases each time, making the next heavy hit you take likelier to kill you, coupled with the fact that most grunt enemies are replaced with elite variants in later levels and you can see where the problem is. The boss fights are amazing, but they're such a ramp in difficulty that you'd be lucky to survive phase 1, let alone 2, which all bosses have. After you beat a boss you get the next level. ""Hurray!"" you might think, until you realise you get to carry all your deaths, your mistakes, your failures to the next level. Hope you like grinding the same stage over and over for upgrades and less deaths. All of this to make no difference against the final stage and boss, and let me tell you, the final boss is a sick joke. Focus (special) attacks don't work on him, he dodges every attack that doesn't follow a perfectly timed parry/dodge, he has a dozen combos with various parry/dodge timings that you must learn on the spot, some of which are almost unreactable, and it only takes a few attacks to get through your defense to kill you, and that's only phase 1. The difficulty of the final boss is like having to fight an Elden Ring boss at the end of a Mario game. I actually laughed out loud when I first fought him because I couldn't believe a dev would put in such a blatant f#$k you to the player, right at the end of it all. The skills system is weird, the uncooperative camera will get you killed in fights, not a fan of the limited upgrades, especially since half of them are useless on the final boss, which is the whole point of your run, music is meh, but overall, not a bad game. I think the gameplay is fun enough to excuse most of the problems, but it was so close to greatness.

On a side note, I had an easier time going for the true ending because I found an exploit that prevented me from ageing when I died. I will never tell a soul how to do it because this game is that hard and I don't want it patched.",1692881923,1692881923,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

I honestly wish I could recommend this game, it has a lot of great things going for it. Unique style, great animations, interesting story, and it takes inspiration from one of my favorite games of all time, Sekiro. It has a lot of unique innovative design, but it unfortunately fails in its execution. As a note, this review is based off of playing the game halfway through on Disciple (Average/intended difficulty), and halfway through on Master. I switched difficulties due to Disciple feeling too forgiving. Master is a good challenge, and it reinforces the ""correct"" way to play Sifu, but it also highlights all that is wrong with the game.

When Sifu is at its peak, when you're balancing tons of enemies and masterfully using the mechanics of crowd and weapon control, it is a RUSH (When you first enter the club is a perfect example). It feels like a skillful version of the old Arkham or Assassins creed games. But those moments are only sporadic, and most of your time will be spent fighting bosses or mini bosses, which at least on Master, it's not just a matter of move memorization, it is lighting quick reaction time as there is constant mix ups in their move set. All of this wouldn't be bad if there was a checkpoint system, but there isn't. So to learn a boss, you get to the boss, die a bunch learning the move set, then because you're old, you replay the ENTIRE area over.

[h1]The problem with the Age system.[/h1]
One of the main draws to this game is the aging system, but it's hardly functionally different than the lives system from old arcade games, except here you start with 50 and can't gain any more, and when you do die, you lose an unset amount of lives, while also locking you out of skills. If you die once, you'll age up one year, you die twice, two years, etc. but if you beat a difficult enemy (or buy a specific upgrade at a shrine (bonfire/checkpoint), how much you age will go down by one (it also resets if you beat an area). You start at 20 years old, and die at 70+ (Anytime you'd age after you hit 70, you die). So for an entire save, you can only die anywhere from 10 to 50 times. The game is only 5 areas. You can restart an area to the age you reached it at, to prevent game over, or to achieve a better result age wise. 

Do you see the confusion yet? If you're 38 at the end of level 1, should you restart? What about 31? If you've racked up 5 death counters mid level, should you reset, or do you hope there's enough special enemies to reduce it before the boss fight? To make matters worse, you lose total health as you age, sure you do more damage, but a player who dies a lot doesn't have the mechanics down yet, so why give them less health? You could be still in your 20's/30's by the time you beat the game because you overestimated the future difficulty, or you could be on one death away from game over on the 4th level. So at best, you've restarted a level over and over in tedium to keep your age down, and at worst you have to either brute force your way to the end, or restart half the game over to get your age down. It's sad to see this unique idea not being well thought out design wise. The age system, being a lives system, shouldn't have made it off the chopping block. They could have easily tied aging to purchasing skills and still achieved similar results (only age through buying skills, each with their own ""training time"").

[h1]The problem with the skill system.[/h1]
The only sense of progression is the skills, but you lose them upon Game Over. You can however permanently unlock them after 5 purchases of the same one, but doing so requires you to have replayed areas over and over. How you purchase those skills is at shrines throughout the level, using XP from defeating enemies. There are shortcuts in the game, to skip over the tedium, but I hardly used them so I could buy as many skills per run. And you'll often find, you may be too old for a current run, and instead of restarting, just play through the rest of the area just to buy skills. And that's not even mentioning the annoyance of buying the same skills over and over, or trying to use techniques you had yet to buy this run. Lastly, you'd think skills carry over on area completion (in addition to 5 unlocks), as your age is set in stone on completion, but I guess you character gets amnesia? Hopefully you see the issue again here, yet again, the game rewards the most tedious aspect of replaying an area over and over, and oddly this time around punishes the player for having few mistakes?  

Another problem is, the only way to heal, is by defeating enemies, or shrines, so you better hope any tough bad guy has tons of enemies before and after. You'll often find yourself going into tough fights with little to no health to get one shot and age up. 

[h1]It feels off[/h1]
It wouldn't be bad if everything felt tactile and responsive, but it lacks ""game feel"". You can deflect enemy moves with Space/LB/L1, however certain enemy moves if deflected will be a parry instead which will allow you to counter. So it almost feels random with new enemies when you get a parry and can follow up. And with dangerous moves (similar to thrusts or sweeps in Sekiro), the only indication is a orange glow on the limb they're attacking with, so you better hope your character isn't blocking your camera, which is another constant issue (Camera is honestly toughest boss). If you do land a parry, you can't combo out of it immediately, the first attack is its own ""combo"", then you can follow up with your own, it's just annoying having to add in an extra input ONLY when you land a parry. There's also directional inputs inspired from fighting games, so expect annoying misinputs because of that. The deflect/parry timing is strict, stricter than Sekiro. So between all of that, what you expect to happen, and what happens is often in conflict, ""I deflected that!"", ""I was trying to kick, not punch!"", etc. This of course decreases with play time, but much of the frustration could have been avoided with better design.  

So this game seems at odds whether or not it wants to punish or reward players for failing or succeeding (age vs skills) and whether or not it wants to increase or decrease replaying an area (shortcuts vs skills). The seemingly conflicting and lack of thoughtful design in conjunction with the lack of tactile responsiveness you'd expect out of game like this, makes me unable to recommend this game. Especially when the main conflict is one of if not the greatest draw to the game, the aging system. I really prefer finishing games before reviewing, but I had to stop playing because I stopped having fun (no, it wasn't because of difficulty, I spared the bosses I did beat and was in my 20's halfway through).

If the game is $10, maybe $15, I think I could recommend it (and/or with mods), it's honestly too short (besides design issues) to charge that price. And although it didn't effect the review, I also dislike the epic exclusivity deal they had.",1692866960,1692868198,False,4,0,0.495565861463546753,0,True,False,False

Worth to mention that backward and forward depends of where enemy is so if ur enemy is not straightfoward but camera is somewhere on left side u need to press SD AW attack.

Sifu is a short game.  But it delivers an awesome experience and I don't feel scammed at all.

I didn't necessarily think the game was easy by any means, but it wasn't as challenging as I'd heard.

All this to say: I was already somewhat good at timing dodges and parries effectively, and it only took me a little while to adapt to each boss's specific mechanics.

This game always gives me the feeling that I'm really fighting. Once you get used to the game, learn the combos, and analyze the enemies well, it becomes a great fighting simulation.

To start, this is not Bamham, or a character action game. Thank you Sloclap for being different. You get a multitude of mechanics, different attacks, throws, blocking, parrying, and ways to dodge, and that's the fundamentals. Nothing (except takedowns) feels automatic or like a ""gimme"", but instead requires spacial reasoning and timing for every action taken

The difficulty pacing is amazingly done. The first playthrough can be a difficult one, as you get used to the unconventional controls and fundamentals. Playing through longer, you learn to adapt to different attacks and fighting styles, forcing you to git gud at different mechanics. On top of everything, you will learn new skills that will either save you in a pinch, manage the crowd, or help your aggro. Replaying the story and arenas will help you with playing around and mastering different methods.

The story is basic, but having a ""Fists of Fury"" story type really sells a Kung Fu game. Classic Kung Fu Movie fans (and Korean thriller fans) will appreciate the style choices. 

Usually I make these things funny but I really gotta praise Sloclap for making my favorite game. I am excited to see what they make in the future (I suggest grappling/wrestling)",1691901412,1691901412,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's combat is fast, cool to look at, and highly demanding on a technical level. You will be very frustrated starting out, but if you work hard and practice at this game, you can master it. Eventually, you can kill bosses without ever letting them touch you. It feels great, and so I highly recommend Sifu to anyone who loves the fighting game genre or is looking for a real challenge.

P.S. The camera in the vanilla game is a little hard to control. It will also freak out and block your view if your character gets too close to a wall, potentially leading to unfair deaths during fights. Luckily, Velindian made a really good mod to help solve these problems and I've included a link below so you can check it out. Said mod takes away the frustration of being betrayed by your camera mid-combat without reducing the inherent challenge of the game.

The twist here is the age mechanic.. beautifully executed and woven into the story. The moment I fell in love was when I realized I could replay any level at any time and attempt to decrease my age for the next.. doing that more and more and picking up new skills and mechanics along the way.

Obviously a must-play experience although I did have a few gripes:
1.) I did experience stutter during some cutscene transitions (this could just be my older PC).
2.) The game allows for dark or light theme for the menus and I decided on dark, but the ""board"" menu is permanently light.. so I would get flashbanged by it when scrolling through.
3.) Musically, I was expecting a more Fromsoft-esque ""epic"" score to accompany the boss fights.

If Sekiro is the greatest sword combat game ever created, then Sifu is the hand-to-hand close relative.

Also the concept of the game is really good, fighting through levels with deaths consequence being your age, which getting older has disadvantages. Im a martial artist myself, a second degree in a mixed style (kenpo) so this game would be right up my alley. Now, the reason why this review is negative is that the controls are REALLY hard to get the hang of. I dont mean the simple hits or anything like that, but things like parrying or dodging are combined with movement keys plus another action. This leads to the action being one, hard to figure out. two, almost impossible to land while in a fight with multiple enemies, and three, the hits may register as a different action or not anything at all. Overall, the game seems really thought out and pretty cool. I would recommend trying your hand at it, if it was free. I think the controls are too complicated and require to much effort from the player to learn, and the game is pretty repetitive. Every level is basically the same, fight through rooms of people, and end with a bossfight. Its the exact same every time, so theres no sense of individuality for the levels. Also, the storyline is very lacking as much of the characters that you end up fighting arent really developed, you just know you have to fight them. 

TLDR, looks like a solid game, but its repetitive and the complicated and hard to learn controls ruin the game. (3/10)",1691028240,1691028240,False,2,1,0.498601227998733521,2,True,False,False

Glorified simon says where the difficulty in what your facing changes and ramps up absurdly when a new enemy type is introduced. you could learn the lesson of what attacks and patterns look like, or you can skip any of this by bringing a weapon to any of these fights, which trivialises the enemies.

The camera is also a nightmare, hugging so close at points that i genuinely cannot see what i, nor my opponent is doing. the game features a fixed camera system, but does not use it nearly enough to resolve this.

Bosses are a joke, where patterns hitherto unseen are introduced so you need to learn a new lesson, on top of having to block a lot of dangerous attacks. woefully short health bars lead to several consecutive deaths on a single boss, aging you extremely fast as per game mechanics, which just means you gotta redo the level.

choices matter system which does nothing, except what my character says to initiate the next bit of the level. It doesn't matter what i choose. These moments should have been used to develop the character instead.

losing key moves because you reset on a hideout means your controls keep changing whilst playing. Responses learned in one run do not translate, meaning your skillset is constantly firing the wrong responses.

indicators for do-no-block attacks, armoured moves, on hit and on block differentiators, which enemy is currently the most threatening, startup frames all woefully lacking. A difficult game only because i have to play pattycake with a machine that is tuned too fast. Do not buy this game.

After additional play, the game continues to rug-pull the player, and never give them space to learn things before encountering them during a boss fight. And then the last boss locks you out of using the supers that have worked all game. It feels awful all the way through.",1690906694,1691012236,False,1,3,0.421451091766357422,0,True,False,False

Gameplay-wise you have your basic attacks and you unlock upgrades along the way that make you stronger. One interesting design decision is that if you buy an upgrade enough, it will be permanently unlocked. There are also more ""roguelike"" upgrades that never get permanently unlocked but serve a greater purpose such as having a higher stamina bar in a particular run.
The game design is also very interesting. And I say it in a good way. There are 5 levels in this game and you can find ""secrets"" in them that enable different shortcuts, sometimes even the whole level can be skipped which is great if you just want to go to the boss fight. And some of these unlocks are within other levels, so you can find a key in level 4 that can unlock a secret passage in level 1. These shortcuts stay forever. I think this is clever and a very nice addition. Levels themselves are quite different from each other and very creative in their design.
As I said, once you beat all 5 levels, you can play the whole game again to go for the good ending and if you unlocked all those shortcuts, it will probably be a much smoother playthrough than your first one. You also unlock game modifiers and ""achievements"" per level that give you points towards unlocking more of these modifiers. These include things from making you invincible to enemies dealing more damage, etc. Most of these modifiers don't count towards high scores but they are a nice addition if you want to replay the game a lot. There's also an arena mode which I haven't tried but the point still stands: it has a ton of replayability.
Now my biggest complain with the game is also on its design and it comes in terms of difficulty. Combat plays out a lot like a souls-like which is perfectly fine, I've played most of them and I like them, but in my case I found Sifu's normal difficulty extremely hard and frustrating. Halfway through the game I switched to easy which improved my experience a thousand times but it was a little too easy for me. There's also a hard mode that I have no intention in trying but knowing this I think I would have organised the game a little different: easy mode should stay as easy, then normal mode should be somewhere in between easy and normal, normal should be hard, and hard should be nightmare or something like that.
That said, the game requires a lot of skill and patience. Easy makes it much less punishing but it's still quite a challenge to get used to the combat and to perform parries, combos, etc. I had a lot of fun playing this once I switched to easy. Before that, I was a bit mad and frustrated at the game being so punishing. 
Story is okay. I enjoyed it but I wouldn't say it changed my life. It's good and it's well integrated into the game. More levels could have made it a bit more explicit and add depth but what's there is serviceable.
Overall, I'd definitely recommend. It's probably gonna be on my top 10 list at the end of the year, but in my case it didn't do enough to become my GOTY of 2023.

However, I do wish that the game had a longer story or perhaps a small story DLC to further explore the character's upbringing and training. It would have been fascinating to witness his growth and development. 

Additionally, if a sequel to Sifu is ever made, it would be fantastic to have the opportunity to experience the journey of a young protagonist learning the ways and secrets of martial arts. Like their previous game Absolver, which had multiple fighting styles, it would be amazing to have a diverse range of fighting styles to choose from. (Personally, I would love to be able to use the drunken style, just like Jackie Chan tbh.)

Turns out it was just the unfairness, because I love Sifu and the enemies stay roughly the same in each stage. 

Yes, there are multiple enemy types in Sifu and you are likely to get taken out by a new move set that you haven't encountered... but all of the enemies are human. They have four limbs that move in limited ways, and weapons which also have limited angles of attack. Once you understand where blows can come from, it becomes a much smoother experience which allows for more adaptable responses to new threats. You also don't lose as much of your progress and, if you fully die, you still have a chance to  use the experience you gained to make permanent skill unlocks. Also the enemies do have SOME variation on replaying a stage; one time a certain enemy may become strong after a take down and another time it is a different enemy. In one run maybe an enemy picks up a weapon they didn't get before. It isn't SO static that every fight is totally predictable.

The skill tree and revival mechanics are too convoluted, but they do work. You can choose to grind the game as much or as little as you want, but you have most of the skills you need to win right out of the gate. It just takes practice, determination, and mastering the flow of combat to really be successful. You start to seize openings, read an opponent long before their attack, and anticipate methods of isolating individuals from groups. Skills really are just the icing on the cake, allowing you to really punish opponents and take advantage of openings.

The game also teaches you HOW to get good while you play. All bosses have two phases. The second boss has a first phase where there are almost unlimited weapons to use, and in the second phase all the weapons are gone. Why? The game is trying to teach you that you don't need them. You need to get good at parry and avoid mechanics, and that is what this boss is a test of. 

The visual design is also incredible. Truly beautiful settings with no small amount of visual storytelling combine to create an almost mystical experience. A friend of mine said the sound of impacts could have been more realistic and that there could have been more realistic blood, but fundamentally this game isn't about realism. No one is pulling off these kinds of victories in real life, so it is better to think of it as a more cinematic experience anyway. Every level is uniquely beautiful, and even all of the arena areas are novel. I was honestly expecting a rehashing of old levels, but the arenas truly are an expansive addition of new areas and challenges to enjoy. 

The game is fantastic. I think at 44 hours I've had as much fun as I will have for now, but I'm sure in a year or two I will have lost all my skill, forgotten some of the enemy layouts, and it would be fun to start over from the beginning. It definitely takes perseverance, but honestly that is determined more by your desire for perfection than by the game necessitating it. I replayed the second stage SO MANY TIMES to make it through without dying... but I was proud when I did, and happy in the fact that I wouldn't need to go back there again. When I just squeaked through the ending at age 25 I felt as though I had truly mastered the game and that sense of mastery just doesn't exist in many games.",1689869119,1689869119,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

I love games that require tight button inputs and timing, however they also need tight controls.

Redundant button pressing is death in a game like this, and it really just add frustration that the game isn't balanced around being there.

The combat is quite deep with many, many options available for offense and defense. It's rewarding and satisfying to learn and improve at. Since combat is pretty much all there is to this game, the fact that it's so good means the game as a whole is mostly a good experience.

Nevertheless, there are a few blemishes. There isn't very much content here, even if what you get is very high quality. A lot of effort is spent getting you to replay levels to stretch that. Bosses are, of course, the hardest part of the game and losing to them means you need to redo the whole stage. It's pretty much guaranteed that your first few attempts at a boss will be losses while you try to learn their moves and figure out dodge and parry timings, which means doing the stage over and over. Even after getting your first stage clear, you'll probably feel the need to redo the stage anyway so as to finish with more age (a sort of limited extra life mechanic) left for the rest of the game. I achieved the normal ending on standard difficulty after just 11 hours, and getting the true ending just requires you to replay the whole game again while making one small change in each stage.

The final stage is also a bit of an anticlimax, as it's short even by this game's standards and the final boss himself turns off one of the more fun mechanics and feels like a step down in difficulty.

With all that being said, I would still strongly recommend this game to anybody looking for a highly challenging action combat game, as the core combat mechanics are just that good.",1689611814,1689611814,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.",1689335925,1689335925,True,0,0,0.471698105335235596,0,True,False,False

I desperately wanted to like this game more than I did. In theory its a ton of fun and super stylish. 

Problem is learning the game well relies not only on memorizing and managing to pull off a number of combo's and button presses in the blink of an eye, it requires you to also memorize attack patterns and combos and be able to read them instantly. 

For example, the dodge/block/countering mechanic doesn't just require you to time it correctly (with a very small window), but most/many attacks also require you to dodge/counter in the correct direction (high vs Low). So when an enemy goes for an attack, you need to already know if its going to be a high attack or low attack and respond accordingly. 

Good in theory, but again, the timing on it is insanely narrow. Other games with counter/dodge mechanics tend to give you 2x or 3x as much time to react, and require less mechanical input to carry out. Its not just ""Press LB to dodge"", its ""Hold LB and flick the control stick in the appropriate direction, oops your timing was good, but guessed the wrong direction""

Additionally, as I mentioned, you need to memorize attack patterns too, because while early enemies will only attack once or will stagger if you block them, others will attack in 2-3 hit combos. Issue is, after a successful dodge or block, you have a brief window to counter attack. This is a problem because the emphasis is on BRIEF. If you wait a fraction of a second to see if they have a followup attack, you'll miss your window, but if you try to counter and they're only hit 2 a 3 attack combo, you're going to get hit instead. 


Given high complexity of the game, I could see it being fun if you literally have dozens of hours available to get really good at it. I imagine it would feel incredibly satisfying to be able to dance and weave around enemies, being a full on Bruce Lee. 

However, if you're like me and don't have that much time to invest in what is a relatively shallow game, I cant recommend it. 

Any game that requires you to spend that much time just to start having fun, isn't getting a recommendation from anyone with limited time to game. 

tl;dr If you have the surplus time and patience to learn the fighting system and have the hair trigger reflexes and pattern recognition skills the game requires, its probably a lot of fun. For the rest, however, the barrier for entry is too high and will likely just cause frustration.",1689083101,1689083101,False,61,3,0.652946591377258301,0,True,False,False

It really allows the player to get creative with how they approach any situation, and it's pure joy to finally manage to clear difficult encounter without dying.

Talking about dying, Sifu does something really interesting with its age system. I've heard some people found it frustrating to start the same levels over and over again, but personally I thought it was really smart. It allows you a lot of leniency with the first levels, so you should be able to see the end of them even if you end up being 60yo, but then it pushes you to come back, train and get better, without forcing you. The level  design itself is built around this: the first time you go through a level, you're forced to explore everything. Then you unlock shortcuts which allow you to go through the level quickly, avoiding unnecessary risks. Once you're comfortable, you can then go back to do the level completely, taking more bonuses in the process.

This is very Kung Fu: do it again and again until your movement is perfect. And as a kung fu practitioner myself, I feel that the game really reproduced the philosophy of martial arts training really well. To talk a bit about the moves themselves, they're cool as shit. I don't think it portrays realistic fights, but I'm pretty sure it was not the goal. Sifu makes you live though Hong Kong cinema fight scenes, and makes you feel like Donnie Yen or Jackie Chan. You're not in a street fight, you're in Ip Man or Drunken Master.

From my point of view the Game has a good idea how martial arts should be perceived and played with a fast paced Gamestyle where your opponents have similiar fighting style if not the same, you are going to beat not only one of them but up to 10 in a small room to proof what you can do with your skill that you have aquired along the way.

You start without any skill in particular but you can unlock a dash kick strike to let them fall and have the upper hand if there are more than you can handle, you need to push them into each other to have the upper hand when your poise is about to break and recover or just use weapons.

The Boss fights have diffrent aspects from melee to staff over to a chained bell, yes a ""bell""( the story explains it).
In every Boss fight you can have the upper hand but if you play Master(Hard), then i wish you good luck.

Here comes the ""BIG"" con.

I felt on Master difficulty, that there is in the combat system and in the hitbox collider a big problem, if you are parrying perfect and you hit them with a bat, you hit ""always 4 times"" and that is to your disadvantage because you can't block or parry, dodging flying bottles is out of question.

The only 2 Difficult Bosses on Master for me have been the 1 one and the last one because their move pacement is so fast, that the only thing you can do constantly is avoid or block, their hit range while every boss is moving in a spinning rotation equal to zero, that means while the boss is moving towards you and the animation is in process you can't damage him ( believe it or not).

The last aspect is the Berserker Mode of the ordinary npc's while in Master difficutly, their strength is not only double the gain a glowing shin on their feets to do damage and it doesn't matter if you block because if you don't have the skill to parry it you maybe die by a average of 6 opponents, later you have even more and stronger.

Some of the skill you poses have litterly zero use on the Bosses because they avoid everything.

But why am i still liking this Game?

Simple! It is repetitive and the art style is nice too, you have in generell 3 difficulties ""Student(easy), Disciple(Medium), Master(Hard), you can change skins or just turn on modifiers to change a little your game that are built in.

In the end you can decide if the Game is worth your money, nobody is forcing you to play it on Master, I for my part just love challenges and it makes more interessting to see how far you can go without giving up.

Have a nice Day.

Each death you suffer will leave its mark on your body, progressively aging until you are too old to fight. On your path to revenge the only way forward is to master the art of kicking ass.

[h1]Combat[/h1]
Every character, including yours, has both a traditional health bar, as well as a structure bar (equivalent to posture in Sekiro). You can defeat any enemy by either depleting their health with plain attacks or damaging their structure. Performing blocks at precisely the right time or moves that throw enemies off balance, will increase the structure bar until it's filled up. This will open someone up for a takedown move that instantly kills them, regardless of remaining health.

Most of the time you will be surrounded by crowds of foes fighting you at once, which means you often can't focus on killing a single enemy at a time. Instead, you will have to react to whoever is the most immediate threat and get them away from you just long enough to deal with the next one. Good situational awareness over your opponents and thinking on your feet are a crucial skills to pick up.

In addition to combos that deal plain damage, some moves have specific utility purposes. Palm strikes can push an enemy away from you to create some space. Leg sweeps knock them onto the ground and disarm them. With throws you can knock someone into a nearby wall for additional damage, or into a crowd to stagger many foes at once. Brute force alone usually isn't enough to do well, but utilizing the environment and choosing the right moves will help tremendously.

Occasionally you will get the chance to pick up weapons like wooden bats or staffs, letting you deal more damage and extending your reach. They are very potent against weaker enemies, who will go down in far fewer strikes. Weapons have limited durability and won't last forever, so you can't rely on them at all times, but in certain troublesome encounters the extra edge can make or break a fight. Throwing your weapon can also stun and massively hurt whoever is unlucky enough to be in the way.

Combining all the various aspects of combat and using them effectively isn't going to come naturally right away. You may start out just circling around groups, trying to play it safe while fishing for lucky hits with some stray punches. The game encourages you to replay stages a LOT, becoming gradually bolder and more secure with your grasp on the mechanics until they become firmly embedded as instinct. This is the point where you will begin making many split-second decisions resulting in impressive looking strings of moves, that knock enemies all over the place and leave nobody in the room with any chance to catch their breath.

[h1]Difficulty[/h1]
Upon death, the game allows you to resurrect right on the spot and carry on fighting immediately. This comes at the cost of your character's age increasing each time you continue. Growing too old means you lose for good and have to restart the level. After beating a level, your current age is saved as a starting point for the next one, so when you die of old age, you only lose progress of the current stage. You can go back to previous ones and try to beat them with fewer deaths, to give you more room for mistakes in the late game, which is very much encouraged.

After struggling to finish the early levels without wasting too many years, it might seem like a monumental task to ever be beating the whole game, let alone replaying it for the true ending. However, you'll find that repeated runs of a level will go by MUCH faster and smoother as your experience grows. Lost health is easily regained with takedowns, and improving at reading and responding to enemies will allow you to do them faster and more reliably.

Consistently playing very badly will eventually force you to start over and try to do better. With overall decently skillful play however, the occasional misstep will not become a serious obstacle. The game is much more forgiving than it makes itself seem, it asks not for perfection, but you do have to grow alongside the game's increasingly demanding challenges.

Bosses are less forgiving, and likely where you will burn most of your deaths on. They tend to react better to some of your ""dirty"" moves and generally aren't as easily overwhelmed as regular enemies. The emphasis lies more on learning the precise patterns on when to block and evade them. It's a very different pace from the rest of the game and feels a lot more rigid in how you overcome them. Luckily, being able to resurrect means you are less likely to be stuck with retrying a boss forever, unless you want to go for minimum deaths.

[h1]Technical Issues[/h1]
Motion Blur and Temporal Antialiasing cannot be disabled easily in-game, it is necessary to edit ""Engine.ini"" in ""%localappdata%\Sifu\Saved\Config\WindowsClient"" and add these lines at the end:

[SystemSettings]
r.MotionBlurQuality=0
r.PostProcessAAQuality=0

I would also recommend installing the game on an SSD if possible. The game loads chunks of the level during gameplay when you pass certain load triggers. This causes a noticeable stutter, which is made worse by being installed on a hard drive. Installing it on an SSD doesn't make it fully go away, but it makes it much more bearable. I'm not sure why proper asynchronous loading wasn't implemented, since consistent stutters in the same areas are quite annoying when replaying levels over and over again. Thankfully most of the time they don't interfere with combat. The game runs fine and without hitches during regular gameplay.

[h1]Final Judgement[/h1]
This is easily my favorite game that I discovered this year. It captures the vibe of a gritty, chaotic martial arts movie, not only with its combat, but also with the attention to detail. Little unpredictable moments like enemies accidentally hitting each other in a crowded hallway or furniture breaking apart into improvised weapons go a long way to make fights feel immersive. The animations for EVERYTHING are incredibly smooth and incorporate the nearby environment very seamlessly, such as unique takedown animations for slamming someone's face into a kitchen table, should you find yourself next to one.
Everything about this game is executed masterfully and it all comes together to an incredibly satisfying experience, that is going to stick with me for a while.

As someone who's been doing Karate for 21 years, seeing a developer create such an incredible re-playable challenging Martial Arts experience with such an interesting concept of Death and Life as a mechanic... I'm blown away.

Learning Martial Arts requires a few things: Desire to learn, trial and error, consistent practice, and working through failure to come back and apply what you've learned from your failure. Getting good at this game draws a clear parallel to learning martial arts, and it's beautiful. It's one of the few stylized games I like (I most go for super realistic graphics and realistic games, but the gameplay within this game is exceptional and gives me the ability to overlook the painted poly-look of the game.)

This game is challenging, but rewarding. I wouldn't consider this game punishing (like some souls games ie. Sekiro, Elden Ring, DS 1, 2, 3, The Surge 1 &2, etc.), this game provides opportunity through defeat. With each death you incur, you grow older, which hardens you. You lose a small bit of your health bar over time, but your damage increases. It balances even in defeat. If you're a new player and you want a less challenging experience, it offers multiple difficulty settings including unlockable cheats and modifiers (requiring some effort to unlock, but very rewarding)

If you're considering getting the DLC outfits, here is a warning to someone hoping to buy the outifts and have them waiting for you on your next load-in. They're locked. You need to earn them (like everything else in the game) through completing challenges that include some serious modifiers.

Do I recommend this game? Yes. Get it. You won't regret it.
Is the game easy? No. If you plan on jumping in and dominating, you will not (without some serious willingness to learn the enemy attacks, enemy types, movesets, situational attacks, dodging, parrying, deflecting, your structure bar, etc.)
Is the game rewarding?

The design of the game mechanics overall is probably my favorite thing. Resurrecting and becoming older with each death which in turn changes your stats and available skills that you can unlock is neat and makes you think about what you should try unlocking first. The shortcuts that open up thanks to keys you've picked up from your previous runs help a ton and calm my frustration immensely by saving me a ton of time, especially those shortcuts that lead straight to the boss.

I only have two complaints: The first one is my interpretation of the tutorial made me feel like parrying was way more helpful than it actually is when instead almost every boss becomes significantly easier if you just dodge instead. Maybe I just misunderstood the tutorial so this complaint is slightly nit-picky.

My second complaint is that I feel like the last boss, the person who is the sole reason you set out on this revenge path in the first place, feels very lackluster in terms of appearance and the fight itself. All other previous bosses have better settings and introductions in my opinion.

The martial arts action is grounded in reality while remaining satisfyingly fancy. While the more flashy moves are a bit tricky to execute well, the game-play rewards skill and precision. The action is captured well in stylised and well done graphics.

The locations you fight in are varied, well done, provide avenues for several different approaches, and some are absolutely gorgeous.

Initially I had one gripe with this game and that was the camera, but then I realised it is just another aspect to be mastered: if you want to be able to always see all of your opponents, you have to be mindful of where you position yourself and remain in control of the flow of the fight. While it may be frustrating at times, for me it just adds another layer of depth to the fight and in a sense makes it even more grounded, as maintaining visibility and awareness is something you'd expect to be an aspect of a real fight, especially involving multiple opponents.

This is a branch of game design that just does not resonate with me in any way. Being a knowledge check in the most thinly veiled way. Sifu looks much better than I expected, with great environmental design and fights reminiscent of Oldboy. The controls are strongly inspired by fighting games, utilizing direction inputs, direction changes, directional double tapping and presumably more. A complicated control scheme is fairly easily justified here if it yields gameplay expressiveness.

The best comparison I can make is a bit of gameplay footage where a streamer beats Malenia in Elden Ring using no armor and only their fist. The fight takes around 2 hours. All the while he's casually speaking with his friends. He has crossed the ""knowledge check"" by such comical margins nothing of the game remains but repetition of the same trick. That's Sifu. It hides the challenge by being ambiguous about what to do, but once that facade is dropped it's just repetition. Enemies abide by attack patterns that repeat and as such can be dealt with using the appropriate directional movements. You can also parry these attacks. Parrying is a notorious muscle-memory check, and once again Sifu is no different. 

It's one interpretation of having the player optimize their gameplay. In some games the challenge is conveyed to you very clearly. Examples include Doom Eternal and Hogwart's Legacy. In other games the challenge is veiled in ambiguity, like Sekiro or Sifu. Even though neither is inherently ""bad"", the latter gets away with primarily ""feeling like"" it's challenging, despite it not really being that at all. The mod that displays the parry frames in Sekiro makes the game trivial. Why? Because the entire challenge lies in you making sense of seemingly arbitrary attack patterns - and this ambiguity masquerades the challenge (note that this applies only to the bossfights, Sekiro has much more going for it outside that too). And the fact that this almost looks like a challenge fools people into believing it actually is.

Sifu has a lot going for it fortunately, such as using the terrain and minor positioning optimization that can both be utilized to visibly increase the player's effectiveness. But the core gameplay loop is really just ""know what to do, then jump through the hoop"", constituting most of the challenge it offers.

I continue to be disappointed by the fact that games designed through this train of thought resonate with people so much, just because they don't really understand it and it feeling profound as a consequence. It offers no dynamic challenge but to just do the same thing over a few times until the muscle memory kicks in.",1688116208,1688116208,False,3,1,0.40956270694732666,0,True,False,False

Think Jet Li in Rise to Honor for PS2 meets Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. The fighting is closer to Jeet Kun Do from what I, a non-martial artist, can see. I would prefer the flashiness of shaolin, but it probably doesn't fit with the setting. If you like Sekiro and have beat Sekiro, you may like this game.

Sifu borrows the posture system from Sekiro's combat with a story like Rise to Honor as you fight to avenge your *insert loved one here*. The controls are tight and it seems to do well with what it establishes. I don't feel like it expands upon enough of the combat for me to keep playing. It seems like parrying is also visually vague, I can never tell when I parry or not. 

The aging feature is cool; a way to introduce limited lives that doesn't feel like you are just counting down. As you age, you deal more damage but have less health and less access to certain upgrades. I would guess that you eventually die and have to start over.

Some issues that I feel should be addressed is playing in 21:9 resolutions. It isn't possible to bring the HUD into view, it is still in the far corners of the screen. It can be adjusted a small amount, but it should be more. This may solve the parrying issue I had, letting me know if I have been hit since I can see my health bar, since whether you get hit or not is also vague. Also, you can't turn off the film grain. This isn't the original Mass Effect, this is a new game; we have learned to make film grain an option, not a feature. Film grain messes with some ReShade configurations and since I can't turn film grain off, I can't use ReShade how I want to.",1688077345,1688077345,True,2,0,0.515635371208190918,0,True,False,False

Dying doesn't feel like a massive set back because you can return to any level and resume where you were at that time.

Sifu is not oversimplified, however. The talisman system will keep you coming back for the game's 20+ hour playtime (on hard difficulties) and allow you to feel your progression through your deaths. 

Ultimately, Sifu will never be as replayable as Absolver, but the appeal of Sifu is so broad that it will certainly outperform Sloclap's debut title.

Flawless graphics, this game really does a great job of teaching you the mechanics of the game, while avoiding becoming a button masher game. The actual game itself is relatively short, but you gain a lot more by replaying levels and trying to get your age of completion of the level lower by not dying. This will lead to replaying earlier levels when you already have beaten them, to try and get them to be a lower age so the higher levels will have an earlier start age. The story and music as well as art of the game are also excellent, great voice acting, and the game also has a secret ending.

and some move set changer like yang move set to play like yang or ip man move set and use ipman model to fight like ip man( i prefer the model based on the i forgot his name guy on john wick chp 4 also played by donnie yen)

As if Sekiro, the Batman Arkham games and Devil May Cry had a baby, with a love for kung fu cinema throughout. Lovely choreography, and a colorful art-style.

Yes, speedrunners can complete the story (a standard kung-fu revenge plot consisting of 5 levels) in ~2h, but there is a ton of replayability. If you are into mastering combat mechanics and enjoy repeating levels to improve your score and performance, there will be plenty to keep you busy, for example:

* Trying to reach each level at a younger age (you get ""older"" as you die, with final death at age 70), as you can repeat any level at the youngest age you reached it at.
* Testing yourself in (currently) 45 challanges. These almost work as separate levels, as you encounter arenas you never saw in the story mode - rooftops, restaurants, warehouses, etc. Hopefully there are more to come.
* Adding modifiers to your playthrough - from making enemies tougher, to removing your ability to resurrect, to replacing your moves with ones used by certain enemies.
* Kicking the difficulty up a notch. I've been playing mostly on Disciple (recommended/default) difficulty, but the jump to Master difficulty is quite noticable. So just when you think you've mastered the game, it can put up more of a fight.

I understand the 40 EUR price tag can seem a bit much, but I think the game is well worth it at any sale. I got it for 30 EUR and think the value for money is top notch.

Finally, an honorable mention to the training mode, where you can pick any foe you've encountered (including bosses!) to practice the parry/dodge timing of their moveset. This is not an easy game, but the difficulty feels very fair, and it is very satisfying to see your skills improve.

As for the combat... This game can be difficult, especially when you just starting out.  A lot of people have gotten frustrated playing it-- but my gosh when you finally learn what you are doing and git gud, it just feels, flows, and looks so good.

I don't have a problem with games that force you to learn the mechanics to succeed. The problem is that games that work like that need to be fair and have functional mechanics. Sifu just doesn't. There is a a clear problem with input lag. Parry timings are vague, and have minimal feedback if successful. Slipping is frustrating to use. It frequently feels like enemies (especially bosses) play by different rules than you do. It's intensely frustrating to constantly fight special enemies that will just power through your attacks no matter what you do. Combos also feel inconsistent. It's a struggle to get the game to actually execute combos consistently with the input lag on PC, and a good number of the combos you can unlock are useless.

The game just arrived on PC and I have been hyped for it ever since its original release on consoles. When you first start this game, you expect to start as a Chinese badass who can stomp anyone in their path, but you start to actually ""play the game"" you end up at age 67 by the second boss. Sifu is a difficult game, but isnt impossible. If you favor games that has a fun factor based from the players ability to mess with the combo system provided, then this game is perfect. I found myself spamming block and a basic LM + LM + RM combo, but then I turned into IP Man as I was able to perfectly parry and dodge every enemy by my 5th run over the story mode. The skills and abilities that the game give you barely change the difficulty, it tests your knowledge on how to use it. You can acquire more health on take-downs through the shrines to get new combos and buffs, but you end up dying before you can take down an enemy. The game has an obvious learning curve once you get into it. The game wont spoon feed you. You will have to use your feeble, new-born hands to grasp that spoon and feed yourself like a grown adult.  After getting all achievements in this game, I can say for certain that if this game doesn't break your monitor, then it would surely have shattered your spirit before hand. You can give up and put down your keyboard day after day, but there is that backbone of hope that you can complete this game.

The combat is engaging and responsive and rewards a skilled hand, easy to pick up but very difficult to master so by the time you face Yang for the 1,000th time you can Parry and Combo like your old man before you.

It's very understandable that many people find Sifu a frustrating experience, and if not for my years of experience in fighting games, I would likely have the same stance as many.

Now on to the pros and cons:

Pros:

- Satisfying Combat
- Very Fast
- Rewards Defensive Playstyles
- Rewards Memory Skills
- Surprisingly Tactical
- Easy Combos
- Mobs Are Balanced
- Memorable Bosses
- Good Progression
- Decent Content For The Price

Cons:

- Story Is A Little Short
- A Lot Of Crashes

Edit: 
I finished this game, it's a pretty good action game, quite satisfying combat. I only have one gripe against it, the audio volume when you hit an enemy, when you deflect an attack or parry an attack is way too low and the visual effects when you successfully deflect/parry is also not very clear.
In Sekiro you get a bigger sparkle and louder sound effect when you successfully deflected and it contributes a lot to how satisfying it is to deflect, in Sifu you get a very fainted ring on deflect and a quickly fainted red circle on parry which you can hardly see in the heat of the battle.

I'm fighting the first big guy and it tells me right click + S to dodge grapples, except it does nothing. I can actually dodge well enough using those same commands outside of this tutorial phase, but nothing will work inside of it, and as it is mandatory to perform that move (which doesn't seem to work), I take insane amounts of unavoidable damage.

Apart from that bug, tutorials on combos and such aren't clear enough. For example, it never says that you have to hold down a key to attack an enemy on the ground. I spent about 10 minutes to figure out how to properly sweep because the game just says ""SW+E"" (which doesn't work), despite the fact it should've been listed as ""S, W, E"" because you have to chain the keys in rapid succession one after the other to pull out a sweep. Then I spent 5 more minutes trying to figure out how to attack a grounded enemy because the game just told me to press a key, but what it never said is that you have to hold the damn key while being near the enemy to pummel them while they're on the ground.

Nothing is explained properly and it just makes for a very poor experience when starting out. I'm sure the game is very good when you've already learned how to play it, but I feel that at this rythm, it's so poorly explained that by the time I'll have understood how to do everything, I'll already be done with the game.

It's 5 stages, that skill level permitting, is around 4 hours to beat.  That said, what this game is it does extremely well.  This is a beat em up, with a very very good/tight combat system.  It's a perfectionist's wet dream in terms of content from that aspect.  After the initial play through, you'll want to go back to stages and complete them with a better age.  The game has a detective board to fill, and certain clues/collectibles (such as a set of keys, access code, etc.) are found in later stages to open previously locked areas of the earlier stages.  Right off the rip when you begin this game, go to the training dummy.  The combat system is rewarding/punishing and understanding the basics of defense is essential.  Its easy to just start button mashing at first, resist the urge and favor defense (avoid and parry specifically).  Said training dummy can also be used to spar with mobs you've encountered in the game (perfect for practicing troublesome foes).  There are also stage modifiers within the game that can be enabled to increase/decrease the challenge. As well as ""student"" and ""master"" difficulties.  Student difficulty is still challenging enough to keep you engaged and trying to improve, don't be ashamed to utilize it for your initial play through.  You can permanently unlock skills using experience, these skills carry over to new games.  In short, if disciple is a bit rough in the beginning give student a go and then return to disciple once you've gained confidence (and unlocked skills).  Outside of story mode, there is also an arena.  Arena is essentially an arcade of various scenarios with specific challenges to complete.  Pure and simple enjoyment and additional content for the Sifu addict.  

If you enjoy the combat system and the challenge it presents, there's plenty of hours worth of play/replay to be found in this game.  You'll be striving to clear every stage while staying young, completing your detective board, and unlocking all your skills.  The plot and setting of the game, although short and simple, create a nice vibe and back story justifying going Jackie Chan on hordes of mobs.

You can see the things they carried over from their previous game Absolver which was an absolute banger as well. Very tough but extremely fun.

Pros:-
1.) Enemy Variety/Design
2.) Combat
3.) Art Style and Environmental Design
4.) Audio
5.) Gameplay loop
6.) The story is surprisingly nice :D
7.) Arena levels are really fun.

Cons:-
1.) Tutorial section is terrible. The developers really need to learn how to express complex game mechanics to people. Too much is left for the player to figure out. And no this is not dark souls. This is essentially a fighting game so stun, combo and avoid mechanics need to be explained much better to people who don't play these kind of games.
2.) Apparently they introduced an easy mode where you can completely go through the game spamming basic attacks. The death mechanic turns into a joke in that mode and you can recover 5 years at a time in shrines which essentially makes that mode absolutely useless.
3.) Game crashed 3 times(once stuck in fall animation and the other 2 times mid-combat).

There's really nothing quite like it, other than its predecessor Absolver. Not many games out there capture the martial artist's feel. A few samurai games sure, a ninja assassin here but they just tend to be stealth-stab or action-slash adventures while this game is a bit more methodical.

What we have here is a roguelike, martial arts tale of revenge. Only five levels that aren't very long on their own but normal players will likely spend a few hours just mastering the first two or so. Every time you die or fail, you age up some years (variable depending on difficulty, on Student I was only aging up one year per death) which makes you do more damage as you become more practiced, but your health bar declines as your frail body does. 

Because I played on the easiest setting for my first run (taking around 3 hours total), I made it to around 24. I also downloaded a moveset mod inspired by The Raid which I think was a bit overpowered but feels and looks great. Moveset modders seem to be able to actually affect damage and conditions against enemies, and apparently there was some disarming effect in my combos that disarmed the second boss rendering him fairly helpless against me. It's pretty funny, but something to keep in mind. Yeah, I wouldn't call myself very good at this game but I'm still having a ton of fun.

Even modded up, I plan on doing one more run as a Student and then upping my difficulty one stage. There's a fair bit of replayability here, especially when you consider all the outfits and other game modes. Every level also has multiple routes, some let you skip some enemies and get to the end quicker. I found one of these one accident on my second attempt at the first level, which sadly skipped the ""Oldboy"" inspired hallway fight scene, which I quite adore.

In theory, if you're a better combo-clicker than I am, you can probably blow through the game in an hour or two and be done with it. It's more setting personal goals for yourself, and even unlocking a literal mechanic called ""Goals"" that you can hunt down for extra in-game achievements that affect all kinds of aspects of the game. Some make it easier, some make it harder. I find the variable customization rather comfortable for my basic self.

Like what John Wick did for movies, breaking down action into its bare essentials and just running everything by stuntwork, Sifu trims the fat of most games. There's not much left to say about it.

its fun to play for about 15 mins in my opinion. i hope they fix the health system, thats my main issue that makes the game unplayable. the fighting isnt really that difficult once you get it down and if you already play combat games , but when you get hit, you lose half or more health in boss fights and sometimes in regular fights against stronger opponents. its a little ridiculous.",1683730350,1683730350,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The art style is stylized and therefore whether or not you find it ""good"" is subjective but I really liked it. The music is amazing. The level designs are some of the best I have ever seen in a game. The attention to detail and beautiful backdrops really made it feel fine playing the same levels over and over. The museum in particular had some really interesting things going on that I don't want to spoil, but I will say they took the time to make entire exhibits that pass for real art - and genuinely interesting art at that. 

The combat is hard to learn but feels amazing once you master it. It's fast paced but methodical and gets better and more rewarding as you learn the game. It can be frustrating at first but learning the complexities is an extremely rewarding experience. The story is also genuinely interesting. I was worried about there only being 5 bosses, but they're so well developed from finding pieces for your investigation board, as well as through environmental storytelling across the levels. Every boss had a unique personality, role, and combat mechanics. 

All of that said, the one thing is that I found parts of the game confusing. The rogue lite elements are poorly explained and I found it confusing to understand what carried over when I started a ""new run"" (which was also confusing, because you can start a new run from a previous level which feels like continuing an old run rather than starting a new one and it wasn't clear to me that that's what I was doing until I googled how all of it works).

The big fights and bosses are not difficult so far and the combat is very fun and free. I was able to get the game fresh and pass the first 2 levels, including bosses, in one age cycle (70+ age).

I think the reason for that is because by design Sifu is a hard game that understands that its players require a learning curve to get good at it, games like DMC for example hit you with these insanely cool moves that Dante can do in a cutscene without much effort and when trying to replicate that in game, it almost feels like a deflating experience to a new player who cannot possibly match the bravado of the great Dante Pizza Man. 

This isn't a criticism of those games, they are fantastic action games, but I almost find myself too discouraged from the get go (on higher difficulties). Sifu on the other hand felt more welcoming because it knew that it was a hard game and death is such an integral mechanic in the game that it allows for a less discouraging experience. Unlike Dark Souls or Sekiro, where upon death you are revived at the last bonfire or idol, Sifu allows you to revive right at the spot you died, this is an incredibly helpful mechanic especially against bosses, this means that you get at least 6-8 tries before you are sent back to the beginning of the level and gives you just enough time to understand the boss's moveset along with the layout of the level. For me death in Sifu never frustrated me or deflated me like in other challenging games, and that's why I think I resonated with it so much.

I replayed the main campaign on Master difficulty on PC and it felt like playing the game for the first time again. It was daunting at first but much like my original play-through if you stick with it and begin to practice, you enter a zone that few games can entrance you in. I was able to complete most levels on Master difficulty under 30, and will try to do a no-death run once I get enough time. In addition to that I think the Arena modes are a fantastic addition that I wish was in the game during its launch period, they allow for other mechanics to shine and really teach the player how to master different techniques during gameplay, that I didn't use during my initial playthrough, such as grabs, directional throws, chasing trip kick, flowing claw etc. Overall it feels like a complete package and I highly recommend this game to any fan of action games, it can be challenging but I think the addition of an easier difficulty will allow lesser experienced players to ease in to the game's mechanics, but for the true experience I do recommend playing the game on the original disciple difficulty if you are well versed with 3D action games. 

I feel like this game really didn't get the appreciation it deserved when it came out, despite selling well, I feel like Elden Ring largely overshadowed its presence and it didn't really get to shine the way I think it deserved. Good action games are few and far between and I really believe Sifu stands among the best, I have played most of the popular action games, and as a casual gamer, Sifu really made me want to become a better player and I can't really say that about other video games that I usually play and for me that's what makes this a special experience. In addition to that I do think the narrative, while simple, is told with elegance and brevity, the cutscenes are impactful and to the point, they are very well animated, and the art style is gorgeous. It provides just enough colour to draw you into its world, but it never distracts from the impact of the more serious tone of the story it is telling. I also think the way it conveys its themes in association with martial arts was quite touching, and each time I reach the true ending, a part of me is unquestionably moved by the final image.",1683667854,1683668072,True,0,0,0.472440958023071289,0,True,False,False

Review:

Sifu is an extraordinary martial arts game that immerses players into a captivating world of revenge, where every punch, kick, and parry carries an emotional weight. Developed by the talented team at Sloclap, Sifu offers an unforgettable experience that not only tests your combat prowess but also fuels your determination to avenge your father's honor.

From the moment you step into the shoes of the protagonist, you're greeted with an atmospheric world that oozes with authenticity. The attention to detail is impeccable, and the environments feel alive with bustling city streets, traditional dojos, and neon-lit alleyways. Every location exudes a sense of depth and history, further enhancing the immersive experience.

The combat mechanics in Sifu are the heart and soul of the game. Every fight is a thrilling dance of strategy, timing, and skill. The fluidity of the animations and the precision of the controls make each punch and kick feel impactful and satisfying. The learning curve is steep but incredibly rewarding. With each encounter, you'll gain wisdom and finesse, gradually evolving from a novice fighter to a masterful martial artist.

What truly sets Sifu apart is its ability to evoke genuine emotions within players. The story centers around seeking revenge for the death of your father, and this deeply personal motivation fuels your every move. As you progress through the game, facing challenging enemies and overcoming seemingly insurmountable odds, you can't help but feel a burning desire to avenge your father's memory. It's a testament to the game's narrative and character development that it instills such a strong emotional connection.

Furthermore, Sifu excels in portraying the physical toll that revenge exacts upon the protagonist. Each time you fall in battle, your character ages, becoming more weathered and worn. This unique mechanic adds an extra layer of tension and urgency to fights, as you're not only battling your opponents but also fighting against the relentless march of time. It's a visual representation of the sacrifices you're willing to make to achieve your goal.

The audio design in Sifu deserves special mention. The hauntingly beautiful score, composed by talented musicians, heightens the intensity and atmosphere of the game. The sound effects are visceral and pack a punch, ensuring that every strike you land or receive resonates with impact.

In conclusion, Sifu is an exceptional martial arts game that combines a richly crafted world, deep combat mechanics, and an emotionally charged narrative. It leaves players with an undeniable desire to avenge their father's honor, immersing them in a journey of growth, perseverance, and ultimately redemption. If you're a fan of martial arts, gripping storytelling, and intense action, Sifu is an absolute must-play that will leave you breathless and longing for more.",1683604811,1683604811,True,1,0,0.517628192901611328,0,True,False,False

With notes taken from Godhand on the side. The game rewards mastery of its systems and brings in new enemies and mechanics at a good pace. Though the game could use a framerate cap option as I can hear my PC fans having an aneurysm when its running.
Over time, the levels can be solved, this isn't a bad thing, far from it; the game rewards not only mastery of its systems but memorisation of its levels. Locating weapon pick-ups and remembering the layouts of rooms will allow you to blow through them at high speed.
The boss fights are memorable and fun, and will have you insisting that that one move they have is complete bullshit, which adds to the entertainment value personally speaking.

The game's difficulty doesn't allow you to live long, the fighting mechanics (ALL about timing your button push in a split second every few seconds for the ENTIRE game) are terrible in my opinion, having to constantly parry some attack that change in range and duration, making it the hardest possible to predict WHEN you can punch the button with enough timing to trigger a parry. Not to mention there's virtually zero hints on when a hit will land, very much unlike the much more user friendly Batman games, where we had a visual something as aid to know when to parry AND enjoy watching the fight as well as the gaming system.
What Sifu does is, it puts you in a martial arts simulator with very limited and hard rules, not allowing for any invention or sneaking out, it might be even harder than fighting someone for real cuz at least in reality you have all the freedom of movement and action. The only other thing here is ""the evasive move"" which is probably the best bet but still leaves you pretty open to attacks from other enemies nearby and takes out all the fun that is 'parrying in fighting games' (like Batman did constantly, flowing from enemy to enemy in a masterful display).

The amount of moves available as well is a LOT less than I'd expect I'd see here honestly. For someone who calls himself 'Sifu' he's got a really limited bunch of attacks, making this game not only very hard but also very repetitive and boring.
I had to use a cheat code just to make it past hordes of enemies without getting old before the first boss, this was no fun at all, but I hoped future enemies had interesting levels and styles to show.
I was impressed with the beauty of the levels (the museum especially) but not with the bosses' styles, finding them too repetitive, especially the last boss.

Haven't unlocked the so called 'true ending', but I'm not going to bother playing this game again.",1683332136,1683332136,False,1,5,0.423611104488372803,1,True,False,False

On a more serious note, Sifu is a little gem. I've been wanting to play this for a long time, but I simply ended up waiting until it landed here on Steam. It can be frustrating, occasionally it feels unfair, but it doesn't take much to see that every failure is entirely your fault.

I love how you slowly go from chaotic to controlled button mashing, as you parry this or that enemy while delivering spectacular takedowns. Oh, and the 2D sections RULE, for real.

On a perfect run it would probably take about an hour to finish it, but in reality it will likely take you 10-20 hours (or more, depending on the difficulty you’re playing at). The game is very challenging on ‘Disciple’ and almost impossibly hard on ‘Master’. You’re supposed to fail again and again, learning to do better in the process, until you really master the mechanics. 

Each time you die, your death counter increases by one and you age the amount of years equal to the death counter, so there’s a limit to how many times you can die. You can always replay already beaten levels to try and finish them at younger age to have more room for error moving forward. Unlocked skills stay with you when you restart a level or even start a new game.

The combat mechanic is very good. It’s responsive, fluid and cinematic, lots of different moves depending on your surroundings, weapon you hold, etc. It does get somewhat repetitive eventually, but it manages to stay fresh for a good while. The controls are simple and comfortable even on mouse & keyboard. The level design in Sifu is amazing and the soundtrack is very good.

If you like to challenge yourself and try and fail again and again, until you master the game, you’ll probably enjoy this one. If not, you might enjoy short (but very fun) experience playing on lower difficulty.",1682854220,1682854220,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- The game is very stylish. It has atmosphere of the old Chinese martial arts movies, the combos and finishers are satisfying, the enemies' design is perfect - memorable but disposable.

- The gameplay is quite challenging, I love it. You are basically a glass cannon, every enemy has potential to finish you in 2-3 combos, and bosses can do that just in several strikes, but at the same time you have enough evade and punish to go through hordes of enemies

- Arenas mode. In my opinion, they are actually more interesting than the story mode, they offer a good amount of variety and challenge.

- Art gallery level. It's amazing, artistic and very pleasant to play through. Bravo.

Now, the list of the things that led to eventual dislike:

- The plot sucks. While the premise of the plot is simple, but solid, the story itself is boring and bland. It's made in ""you start with zero knowledge about why things happen and search for clues"" kinda way, but 80% of the clues is garbage that gives no actual info, the amount of actual information is disappointingly little, and there's no sense in what is going on at all. The plot ""twist"" isn't a twist at all, it's just very basic and vague justification.
In fact, ""vague"" is the best word to describe the plot. The developers apparently decided that if they would make it vague enough, gamers will imagine the plot to be better than it is.

- The main aspect of the combat is to learn attacks of the enemies to effectively dodge and parry them, and that just takes too much time. Training mode, an extremely important aspect for games like this one, is almost useless - it gives you a task and ends as soon as you'll get it right once. So you'll either have to boot it again and make 40 seconds pause each attempt, or just train during the game itself, restarting dozens of times, just to train.

- Out of 5 levels, one is amazing (art gallery), one is decent (the club), and the rest are forgettable and bland garbage. I don't think I would've actually notice it, if there weren't for good levels to make such a contrast. The rest are just so bad in comparison, it's stunning.

- Artificial difficulty. Again, I like that this game is challenging, but some of the grind to learn dodges and parries is due to cryptic and deliberately difficult to read attack telegraphs. Some attacks are almost instant with little to no telegraph at all (like the gut kick), some - has unexpected pauses in animation, just to mess your parry time, and some has sequence of quick attacks, that correspond poorly with animation - it may show one attack, but you have to parry twice, and some - show 4 attacks, but you have to parry three times. Also, camera is bad, it may change angle unexpectedly, and that messes up your input directions, because they depend on the camera. 

- Cheap bosses. The first two are OK, fairly easy even. The rest three bosses are made in a way that you have to remember their attacks by heart to get through them without dying 5 or more times. They don't really change your perception of the game, nor do they demand to learn new tricks - just dodge and parry their attacks with unobvious animations and cryptic telegraphs. The last boss is somewhat interesting, but still very cheap, because he takes away some of your arsenal, and you're basically left with fewer attacks against a guy with tons of health and combos that are near-impossible to interrupt - most of your parries don't stop him. 

- Basically no proper ending. Getting a true ending is difficult, so it is beyond disappointing that there's no decent cinematic, no proper epilogue, there's no explanations to the weight of your actions. This is just lazy, and unsatisfying. There's supposed to be a big lesson here against violence, but it's not only ridiculous (let's forgive a bunch of murderers, two of which killed a child, because that'll make me a better person, sure!), but it's self-contradicting, because in order to forgive 5 criminals, protagonists murders hundreds of people on his way to them, some of which are literally asking the protagonist not to fight.

It's not a bad game, but it's a game with a ruined potential. It could've been SO much better if the developers had more resources and/or talent.",1682622263,1682664070,False,6,0,0.447871416807174683,0,True,False,False

There are only 5 levels to the main game, and 5 different enemy types not including their Elite versions. The main draw of this game is skill improvement; learning the enemies' fairly simple combos in order to punish appropriately with dodges, parries, or even attacks with innate dodge properties. If this sounds remotely fun to you, then don't hesitate to try this game. While it's fairly contained in terms of combat, it has a surprising amount of depth and skill expression that you may not even begin to scratch the surface of after 50 hours. For any potential new players though, there are some issues I have with the game that I feel will push some away from being too punishing and obtuse.

	Each time you die, a counter will tick upwards from your starting age of 20 and continue stacking, carrying over from each level. Each decade milestone you reach will lower your maximum health, but increase your damage. Once you reach the ripe old age of 70, it's game over. A majority of your game time will be from replaying levels to master them, lowering your death count, optimizing your combos, and overall just improving at the combat. While this sounds fairly interesting on paper, as someone who has played this game to death both on Steam and the EGS, I personally think this system is backwards and creates a negative feedback loop.

	Firstly, I believe the aging system to be way too punishing for a new player, while experienced players will just straight up completely ignore it. While it succeeds in its intended purpose of preventing an unskilled played from limping their way through the game without taking the time to improve, it fails just about everywhere else.

	[b][u]1.[/u][/b] As previously stated, aging milestones lower your max health but increase your damage. As a new player who is consistently dying a lot, this does absolutely nothing other than making it easier and easier to die, accelerating the fail state against you. As an experienced player, who will very rarely die, this system can be completely ignored and will never come into play.
	[b][u]2.[/u][/b] Aging milestones lock away parts of the skill tree. For a new player this obviously makes the game harder to play, as you must level perks 5 times each before being permanently unlocked, and if you haven't gotten these skills before completing a level and reaching an older age, you must either replay the stage to keep your age low or continue on and forego the skill, some of which are incredibly expensive but also powerful. As before, an experienced player will never have to interact with this system.
	[b][u]3.[/u][/b] Aging too much discourages you from even continuing on to a new level. Since age carries over between levels, and can only be lowered by completing the prior level with a lower age, lowering the next level's age retroactively, there's literally no point in even attempting the next one you've unlocked before improving on the last one. Barely beating a boss while you're low health and at the maximum age doesn't feel rewarding nor exciting, it just leaves a sour taste in your mouth knowing it doesn't even matter. 

	Those of you familiar with the game might be thinking to yourselves that the obvious explanation for these systems is to encourage you to replay levels to improve your age, while improving your skill at the same time, in a sneaky, albeit ham-fisted way to force you to improve. While I've made it clear that I dislike this system because players who have improved at the game and rarely die will never have to interact with these systems ever again, I dislike it even more for another reason; it's completely unnecessary.

	These 3 mechanics I've just discussed are only in the game to justify their own existence. 
	If I am dying a lot and limping through stages with an obscenely high age, I already want to improve. I don't need extraneous systems to force me to replay levels for fear of punishment. 
	I don't need my health to be lowered permanently or to start losing my skills; if I am reaching a new level at the age of 60, I'm already going to replay the last level. 
	If the 3rd stage's boss got me to age 65 before beating them, I'm not going to continue on to the next level. Depending on your death count, you may only be able to die twice in the entire stage, including the boss fight, before a game over.

	Lastly, I think the max health and damage mechanic of aging should be reversed to be less punishing. If you're dying a lot, having higher max health but lower damage would make it easier to learn from your mistakes and improve your pattern recognition of enemies; fights would take a bit longer because of your lower damage, but you would have more durability so as to not have an encounter you're still unfamiliar with beat you into the ground.

	If you've made it through this wall of text, just know that I don't dislike Sifu; quite the opposite in fact. Despite how negative this review may seem, it comes out of love for the game and a desire for it to be improved even further, whether in an update or a sequel. The combat has great depth, is incredibly fun to master, and with the most recent update including an Arena mode there is more than enough content to consider the game a full package. I just wanted to point out the issues I had when I first started the game about 6 months ago on the EGS, and that I've seen crop up repeatedly as my friends started playing as well.

Timing is going to be the cruelest thing if you're expecting this to be like the Batman beat 'em ups; the stunned/downed/parried windows are short (but doable) and (most) indicators are subtle (not an icon floating over their head). 

The game also plays very defensively. You have to make space and openings if you want to make attacks of your own. You can play aggressively, but it doesn't always work (like with bosses).

That all being said, the worst aspect of the game is definitely the camera. It doesn't control well (with controller or keyboard, I've used both). The main problem is that you don't get to directly determine zoom level, and certain things (takeouts, level events, or specific boss attacks) will take control of your camera. The game does outline enemies through walls while in combat, so sometimes it's ok, but other times there's no saving a bag angle

Overall, a fun game. Don't get it if you want something casual. Absolutely get it if you want a more challenging beat 'em up. Get it immediately if it's down to $20. I think it's a $40 game, so I paid that, but it is kind of old

Edit now that I've completed it: I don't recommend Master Mode until after you beat the game. The biggest problems I have with the game are still nitpicks; mainly, visibility. This is especially bad in the first arena where you fight in a dark alleyway. Cool aesthetically, but not fun to need to see in. Another big thing is the gauntlets before the boss fights. They're (generally) just too long. Main level gameplay and boss gameplay are totally different, which is fine, but you put one out of your head while doing the other.

[b][u]Combat[/u][/b]
Combat and movement are deceptively simple - light and heavy attacks, block and deflect/parry. Directional movements determine your attacks and whether your back is facing an enemy. 


Deflecting is pressing block at the last second before an attack lands, negating some ""structure"" damage, think of it as maintaining your form and posture during the fight. Deflecting certain attacks will result in a parry, stunning the enemy temporarily, and allowing you to counterattack however you choose. Hitting enemies and deflecting attacks will build their structure bars and when theirs breaks, allows you to execute them with a finisher that is contextual to the environment (you can adjust the camera distance to maintain vision on remaining enemies).


If not deflecting or blocking, you must [b]AVOID [/b]attacks. There are two directions for this - hold block + [b]up/down[/b]. Pressing [b]UP [/b]during block will avoid low attacks as you lift your leg up, whereas pressing [b]DOWN [/b]will avoid all high attacks as you move your body down or sideways. These avoids will allow you to whiff punish and can help lower how much structure damage you've accumulated. [b]DODGE[/b], on the other hand, is a full movement in any direction but will not allow proper punishes on enemy attacks.


In terms of skills, you will unlock them as you spend XP between shrines located in the levels or at your home. Each skill will be available when you spend on it but will lose it upon death unless you have spent on any skill 5 times for a permanent unlock. E.g., I buy the leg sweep once and then die. I can't use the sweep again but the game will list it as having been purchased once so you can spend on it again to use it, and eventually get to 5 purchases and you will never lose it upon death.


As an additional note, your character doesn't have many i-frames to hide behind so you must choose your actions carefully, accounting for how enemies are surrounding you. Some animations will allow you to avoid high attacks.




[b][u]Structure of the game[/u][/b]
The game pits you against 5 levels and bosses that you must progress through, each death will increase your death counter by 1 which is then added to your current age starting at 20. E.g., dying at 20 will age you to 21 and your death counter to 2. Dying again will age you to 23, death counter to 3, etc. Your death counter is reduced by one at certain encounters, at upgrade shrines, or [spoiler]between boss phases.[/spoiler] Every 10 years from 20 will reduce your health and increase your damage and you have 5 decades to survive.


The levels are as follows:
The Squats
The Club
The Museum
The Tower
The Sanctuary


Let's say you have completed The Squats and you are 28 years old when you get to The Club with only one upgrade to your structure bar. If you choose to return to The Squats, you will revert back to 20 years of age and no upgrades. If you complete The Museum at 50 years with multiple upgrades, again, returning to The Club will revert you to 28 with only your upgrades at that point.


This is all to encourage you to improve each run through a given level and keep your age to a minimum, as reaching 70 will be your last chance. It also gives you more room to re-select upgrades or increase how much you can spend on them.


[b][u]Arenas update[/u][/b]
The arenas are set levels (completely separate from story) with conditions and challenges to fulfil - these will unlock the next arenas progressively.


This update also provides gameplay modifiers (available in story) which affects both you and enemies, for easier or increased difficulty.




[b][u]Art and music[/u][/b]
The art direction and music are utterly amazing. You just have to see and hear it for yourself. There are so many great visual compositions found in the levels and some also change with your combat, it's such a treat to traverse each level.

It is a genuinely engaging martial arts game with rogue-ish elements. The combat is very tight and encourages patience and weighted decisions - simply mashing buttons will not fly.
The difficulty is more about maintaining your own focus rather than upgrading your character. The aging mechanic is both unique and impactful: there is always a feeling that making mistakes takes away something from you aside from general health loss.

This game expects you to go in shaking fists, get your teeth kicked in, and then, most importantly, contemplate wht you did wrong and take a calmer, more focused approach on consequent runs.
For example, knowing what works and what does not allowed me to go from losing half my lives in the first level to acing the first two levels completely hitless. 

And yes, the combat system is incredibly tight, and emulates real-life kung fu moves suprisingly well.

This Game is Good. I'm sure you all agree

However There's a Trick to this game.

You see the game was realeased in early access with no student mode

on disciple and master.

Because of your addiction to hard as possible games on rogue lite

Most of you played in on Master.

Well if you completed it i feel very very sorry for you.

You see Student is easier yeah and what you might think is I have to prove i'm good by defeating it on master

but there are a few trick imbedded in this game

you see the enemies are simply too hard on master

you say ""That's the point""

We say ""no no you don't get it. The moves the character has and ablities make it impossible to enjoy master or disciple. More over the spectacale of martial arts this game advertises will be no where to be found on both those difficulties

the enemies will contiually interput you and will have too much health.

Yes that's right they are so hard. Most of the game will be spent dodging, Running and dieing.


Whereas if you played it on student. It's still quite hard but you get to see the Sifu's martial art


Now there's another thing to the game

you see you have a finite amount of lives.

With bosses that are immpossible not to die to  (i'm sure you agree)

with a limited amount of lives you won't complete it.

and to start again will be a bother

on both the higher difficulties no modiifers are allowed

and there in lies the problem

while playing it on those higher difficulties not only are they harder but no modifiers like 

lower enemy levels or 

slower attacks or 

the big one gain 1 year back from defeating hard enemies 

are allowed


That's right. With those modifiers the game changes from roguelite to hack and slash with decent difficultiy


Now then let's have a discusion about roguelite

did you enjoy Sifu?

YEAH

Did you hate how much you died

YEah

Where the enemies to hard

YEAH

Where the bosses impossible

YEAH

Did that live a soar taste in your mouth

YEAH

Did the modifiers on student level help make the game more enjoyable

YEAH YEAH

There you have it

Then why did you insist on everything harder
why did you insist on souls like everything

there is a game that strips the roguelite away when you finally admit it's too hard

and at first you chose master

roguelite

then you chose student

rogue like

then you use modifiers

hack and slash

so why?

Why do you harrass the developers for souls like rogue lite

when you all hate her

so do i

no then

enjoy the rest of summer

with more rogue lite and souls like 

enjoy the mess you've made

you think they are going to make another like this

i look forward to you having 2 screens on the you stream at the start

showing you are playing master

then actually use student and modifers

say you are playing it on master

make sure you keep that one handy

in case someone asks

have the ban button ready

when they catch you out

Each enemy has a flow-chart they follow that determines what attack they will make, with some attacks branching into multiple options, meaning you have to either find a solution for both of them or react to whichever comes out, but the game generally doesn't give you enough time or feedback to let you know which is coming out.

This means the game is hard, not because executing any of the combat is hard, but because you have to learn the flowcharts of each enemy and figure out the appropriate response to each step in the flowchart.

An example of something that makes the game artificially difficult is the evasion system. Sometimes you have to evade upwards and sometimes you have to evade downwards, but the difference between which it is is extremely subtle and combined with having little to no time to react means you just have to find an alternate solution.

Another problem is the targeting/camera system, which other people have pointed out. Backwards/forwards is not determined by the direction of the PC but is simply always up on keyboard/stick, meaning that moves which require directional input are unreliable because what the player thinks forward is and what the game thinks forward is will be different at times.

The game is extremely beautiful and the gameplay is really close to being good. I suggest playing on easy (student) difficulty because it just isn't worth it to beat it on master (hard). The game only has a ~20-30% completion rate, so make sure you take the easy way out when possible.",1681696204,1681696204,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Fairly short overall but designed to be replayed either because you got a key item that you need to use in a previous level, improving your score or keeping your Age Counter as low as possible. 

The Age Counter is the death mechanic where everytime you die, the counter goes up. 
You start with 20 years and each time you die the counter doubles, so from 20 you go to 21 then from 21 to 23 and so on. The counter though gets reset if you complete a segment in the level while the age stays the same until the end of the game. So if you're having trouble with a level due to the fact that you do not have enough retries anymore, since the maximum age reachable is 70 then your best bet is to replay a previous level and try to die less times or not at all.
Though the older you get, the more damage you do, with the downside that some abilities become become locked and you have less health. Overall I never felt the counter being annoying or boring, kept me wanting to perfect my performance and try to finish the level without dying.

The game does not hold your hand (unless you play the lowest difficulty level which I personally didn't try) but it is very rewarding, I felt that since I started playing the game I got better everytime.

Once the game is over and you either do not want to replay the game again (which honestly you should to at least get the other ending which is very well done) there is the arena mode which features new levels with different goals: either you gotta survive and try to not die, defeat marked enemies, capture zones or just complete the level with as little time as possible.",1681587523,1681587648,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It also feels great, especially the finisher animations. Parrying and countering with a massive counter still gives me a massive dopamine rush.

The new Arenas expansion is extremely cool, although it kind of disappoints me that there still isn't a randomly generated endless mode, which was pretty much what I mostly hoped for. The Arenas expansion is basically a second and even more challenging campaign, but without any story behind it (as far as I know). All in all, a fantastic game and a 9.5/10 for me, because it kind of lacks replay value, once you master the combat entirely, because none of the levels in the game (not even Arenas) are randomly generated.

Except for sweeps, they are overpowered and counter-intuitive to dodge.

All bosses are just non-stop sweep spam, except for the first two and the last phase of the third. Every other boss is super tedious, has more range, damage goes through block and you cant parry 90% of them. The fun fighting experiance is undercut by the fact you have to rely on the focus mechanic, which is often too slow, and is completely unusable on the last boss (literally locked during the fight). So the game teaches you to abuse a mechanic just for it to not be used in the final boss fight. If sweeps weren't made to be nearly impossible to predict or dodge, this game would be 40x better.

Recommend non-boss fight gameplay,

The combat is extremely satisfying and you can really feel yourself become more powerful as you master the difficulty curve. There are a few unlockable perks, but your character doesn't so much get stronger as you just get better and the game really rewards you for it.

Parries feel incredibly snappy and the follow-on punish attacks appropriately devastating. Movement controls are fluid and responsive. You have sizeable array of combos and moves to choose from - I'd say just the right amount of variety without it becoming intimidating and unmanageable, just about every move serves some sort of useful purpose in defeating the different enemy types the game throws at you.

Boss fights are tough but rewarding, they all have some sort of flaw in their attacks that can be taken advantage of to win without dying.

The levels are well designed with an excellent amount of visual diversity between each of the five levels. Progressing through each level and recovering keys and other objects open up new shorter routes to get to the boss chamber, this usually comes at the cost of not being able to unlock all the shrine perks so its kind of a tradeoff that I feel is pretty fair in its execution.

Visually the game is extremely pretty to look at, the user interface is clean and minimalistic, the art style is gorgeous in its simplicity, and each level feels incredibly diverse with a good mixture of open and claustrophobic spaces.

The Bad:

The camera needs work. There were points in the game where I felt fighting the camera was harder than fighting the enemy. It's not so bad when fighting in wide open spaces, which the game is fortunately generous with, but if the fight gets close to a wall or corner things get very claustrophobic very quickly as you lose situational awareness. 

The game seems to have some sort of ""smart"" camera system where it will occasionally pivot or snap to a rail when cinematically appropriate, most of the time the desired effect was achieved and it looked cool as hell (like the hallway scene) but sometimes the script that governs the camera decides to wrench the whole thing in a bad direction when you want it to go the other way and you end up wrestling with the AI cameraman usually to the detriment of the fight.

There were a few annoying progress blocking bugs, the most egregious being when a certain boss goes into their second phase but just straight up doesn't spawn inside the fight area, this fortunately only occurred once with that boss, and on a few other occasions when an NPC didn't spawn preventing a door from unlocking.

The game is fairly short, but its a fair length for the listed price, my only gripe is I wanted more :)

In short that is what Sifu is.; it's challenging, punishes you for button mashing, and rewards patience and timing. Sifu has a simple revenge premise; but as you get further into the game, it also has principles of Eastern Martial Arts philosophy in the story. I won't delve too much into it, but it has themes of martial morality. At the heart of Sifu's gameplay is the combat system which includes: light attacks, heavy attacks, dodges, parries, blocks, and counter-attacks. Think of it as a mix of Sekiro, the Arkham Series, and a little bit of DMC. Like Sekiro, this game is all about breaking your opponents' structure (posture in Sekiro) which leaves them vulnerable to a takedown that will remove them from the fight. Like the Arkham games you're put into arenas against multiple opponents and you can counter. The countering is more complex in Sifu, instead of hitting a button right when the enemy is about to strike you, you have to parry or dodge an enemy's combo and then counter when there's an opening, also known as punishing in the Sifu community. There's also a skill tree and a progression system which is where the modern mechanics come into play, taunting your opponents increases your score multiplier allowing you to gain XP faster for those shrine upgrades to make your character more powerful. Perhaps the most interesting mechanic in Sifu is the aging system, unlike in old school beat-em ups where there was as lives system, Sifu has an aging system where each time you die, you age, as you get older your character deals more damage, but the flip side to that coin is you can take less damage. So if you play offensively when you're younger and getting your ass kicked, as you get older and become a glass cannon, you may have to adapt your playstyle to one that's more defensive. While not a game for everyone, if you're a fan of the aformentioned games, Yakuza, Sleeping Dogs or Asian Martial Arts movies, or more recent Western shows like Daredevil, or the John Wick movies, Sifu is another game to add to your collection. It's not a very long game, but it does have a lot of replay value, an arenas mode, mod support and your first run through the campaign will take longer than the 4-6 hours.",1681069155,1681132780,True,1,0,0.513513505458831787,0,True,True,False

What makes this game different? Everything, from the bottom of its core its completely different and way better, for starters its single player aspects that was so much more enjoyable in this style. It feels like absolver was purely a test run before making this one and it shows, everything has completely been revamped and remade and it simply just works way better. 

But enough of the comparisons, what of the actual game at its core. The story is clear and simple but not a very big strong point in the game, its pretty much just a revenge story with two options to play as a bad guy or good guy. Seeing how the story is so simple i dont have much to say about it so lets move on to the actual stuff which is combat. The game does martial arts a justice (coming from someone who has done it before), every move is carefully captured and the flow never seemed to be off at all. Every mistake i made it felt like i was making it, every misplaced dodge or block seemed to feel like it was me and not the game at fault which is a huge bonus seeing how other games get this wrong all the time. I usually dont use vibration in my games but with this one i felt it was needed to feel the full impact of every strike and hit, every block and counter i could literally feel through the controller which was nice. It felt so good when i finished someone, when i carefully blocked or parried, when i dodged and done any sort of counter i felt it, i cant possibly say anything negative about the combat at all. Upon that i even noticed sometimes i would actively move my head or body with the flow of the combat; thats how involved i was in the action and i think that speaks volumes. 

The difficulty, at the beginning it was fun, the first level was almost a breeze and the first boss really showed the importance of parries, dodges and timely blocks alongside counters but not so hard. The second area was a bit harder with the introduction of double lifed enemies, however still not that big of a problem and i actually enjoyed the more lengthy mission. With this boss it really showcased the importance of timely dodges but not so much anything else just there for you to protect dodges, id say more easier than the first boss was. Although after this it got really weird for me, the missions after this one was beautiful to look at and very interesting and unique, the regular enemies werent that bad either but what comes with complaints were the bosses after the second boss you encounter. The third boss for some reason was very odd, throwing out attacks randomly very far away from you as if they expected you to run like a mad man towards her, then she uses although predictable moves at its core but randomly coded so you have to notice the body movement more. She uses a long range chain scythe and even blocking makes you take damage which so far completely negates everything youve learned this far, why? i have no clue. Then onto her second phase which forces you to parry her moves that come out in miliseconds, i suppose you could try and try again to learn the exact timing but even if you do you only get one hit on her and sometimes you dont even get a hit in after parring which flaws its own combat system. After that the next boss is exactly the same, lazy, but with a different moveset that forces you to use running attack spam to get one hit on her then she flies away ... somehow. I feel like these two bosses were the worst experiences of my game and could be a prime example of at least having structure damage be permanent on enemies instead of it lowering so fast just for the sake of extending this already short game. The final boss ... man i dont know about anyone else but this dude kicked my ass 20 times before i had to literally lower the difficulty just so i could have a chance. Its as if they expected you to have 500 hours already spent in the game because he combos you so fast that if you blink youre already dead, if you make one mistake youre dead, if you even throw out a attack he backsteps miles away then taunts you and if you throw a attack at all he counters it and then ... yep .. youre dead. The only time i ever landed a clean hit on this dude was when i lowered the difficulty, and i was playing on normal this entire time. This is when i thought the game was pretty badly made because at what point did anyone before him be this insane? not once, they didnt prepare you at all for this kind of fight and at the first 15 tries i thought i was playing a completely different game. I even died to this dude on easy mode a few times, was that fun? me personally i didnt find it fun at all. If i can play a game throughout 99% of it on one difficulty and then practically be forced to lower it on ONE ENEMY then yeah they should've done something different. 

The overall negatives that i saw after that was the camera, i constantly fought with it the entire game and i constantly got backed up into a wall where my camera would then get glitched into the wall and i couldnt see so i was then beaten to death. I then sometimes had glitches where the boss of a area would get stuck and refuse to enter the boss area, practically forcing me to restart the entire mission which was annoying but other than that nothing else.

The most important thing you need to know is that you will die A LOT in this game, and each time you do, your character gets older. As each decade passes, your maximum health goes down and your damage goes up. If you die past age 70, it's game over. 
Chances are, you will be replaying levels so that you can finish one younger than you did before. This is because your youngest age at the end of the previous level is how old you are when you start the next one. To ensure that replaying isn't a slog, the game is designed so that after your first runthrough of a level, you will have access to shortcuts which skip large chunks of the level, if not nearly all of it. If you're someone like me who has played Sifu prior to its release on Steam, the main story will take you 2-3 hours. If you're new, well, the amount of time will vary significantly. Anywhere between 8-12 hours seems right. But if you're itching for more, Sloclap has you covered.
After beating the main story, you have optional ""goals"" that you can do to unlock new outfits, many of which are references to iconic martial arts movies. There's also an arena mode which introduces a variety of new environments and levels to put your skills to the test.
Overall, Sifu is an excellent beat-em-up game based on a martial art known as Pak Mei, which is similar to Wing Chun. For the layman who knows nothing about martial arts, basically Kung Fu. Its controls are simple but require good timing and general awareness of your ingame surroundings/opponents. If you want a relaxing or easy game, this isn't what you're looking for. But if you're up for a challenge and are a fan of martial arts movies, you've come to the right place.",1681008572,1681008572,True,91,2,0.884320974349975586,0,True,False,False

Parrying works maybe 30% of the time and deflecting vs constant blocking really does nothing to help you.

There are some good things about the game the actual movements that you're performing are smooth and visually it's pretty appealing. The sound design is not all that bad and the visual art style is cool in its own right. Actual directional audio is not bad either. Between audio and visual, it's really not bad at all.

In reality, if you like games that are extremely hard for really no reason and you have to teach yourself everything with the game giving you nothing is your jam, you would love this. If you are trying to play a fun game that is martial arts geared and allows you to have fun smacking down opponents, this is definitely not the game for you. This takes hours and hours to get good at. Many people I have seen have tried to justify that saying it's close to how martial arts normally take a long time to master but guys, it's a fucking video game. If you want to have fun, take your time elsewhere. If you want to be challenged beyond mental repair and turn your day into a living hell, this is the game for you masochist.",1680976913,1680976913,False,2,0,0.470473349094390869,1,True,False,False

Waiting a year for the release of the Steam version was worth it.

The combat is technical and deep, the game is actually hard on the highest difficulty (unlike most modern games), challenging, unapologetic, has lots of difficulty modifiers, graphically it is very nice to look at, stylish, polished and most importantly is very fun to play.

Difficult and challenging games like Sifu are the reason why videogames are amazing, they aren't afraid to challenge the player and they teach us a valuable lesson: sometimes life can be filled with difficulties and obstacles and in order to overcome them and achieve our goals, a person must be willing to work hard, learn, adapt to the situation and oftentimes fall, get up and keep moving forward (something that modern games, in my honest opinion, have completely forgotten to teach us).

I really wish that more games nowadays (from 3A with a big budget to indie games) adopted this mentality.

If i had to nitpick and express what i disliked or my concerns with the game, they would be the following:

1) The current lack of an endless survival mode: This is definitely my biggest concern.
I was expecting Arena mode to have at least one endless survival challenge where the player must defeat as many enemies or waves as possible.

Unfortunately this is not the case, the current survival challenges have all a fixed amount of waves to clear.

It would be a real shame if an endless survival mode won't be implemented in the future.

(Devs, if you are reading this review) I personally posted in the discussions section my ideas and suggestions for a customizable endless survival mode.
Please check this discussion if you are interested:

https://steamcommunity.com/app/2138710/discussions/0/6252726091241784916/

2) The current lack of a Steam Workshop.

3) The avoid command: After +70 hours i still find the avoid command (Guard + Movement) quite inconvenient.
I would personally implement in the options menu an additional way to perform this command, more specifically:

Guard + Interact: To avoid High, medium attacks and grabs.
Guard + Pick up weapon: To avoid Low attacks.

Very similar to how you would perform a counter in the Ninja Gaiden series.

In conclusion, Sifu (as long as you play it on disciple or master difficulty) is a break from the current trend of unnecessary over simplification, constant hand holding and instant gratification in modern gaming.

1.a) Game loads very long. It could take a solid minute between ""restart hideout"" click and you getting the control of your character back.

1.b) Game stutters when entering certain areas. This makes you take some cheap hits in the beginning of the fight which is not ideal.

2) It takes quite a while to return to a boss after you die. I understand, that it ties to the game death mechanic, e.t.c. but whatever the intentions were, the result is that you could end up wasting 5-7 minutes to get to the boss (apart from the 3rd boss).

3) Bossfights are not that well balanced. This comes from an experience beating the game for true ending on Master for first time and then doing a quick rerun of everything on Normal. On Master difficulty enemies are seemingly faster but also gain a lot of optional combos. ""Optional combo"" in reality is exactly the same combo (in terms of timings and telegraphs) but it can be abruptly ended by some unblockable (they are kinda blockable but always deal a load of structure dmg) attack with barely any telegraph other than ""Just look at their limbs lemao"". The problem here is that there are two types of unblockable attacks: one requires weave back and punishes weave forward, other -- requires weave forward and punishes weave back. This means that the only way you can reliably fight the boss is to be able to react to the telegraph (which is usually <0.2 seconds from start to damage), read it correctly and then dodge accordingly. This makes it barely possible to dodge even if your reaction time is much better than average since you still need some time to do a proper read. At the same time on normal, enemies either don't have this extensions or rarely ever use then. Recovery time is so slow that you can sneak in an attack and you still have time to read+dodge almost everything, which leaves me wondering if I've ruined the experience for myself by starting on Master difficulty which is far from being fair. 

4) Continuing the Master-Normal comparison, every enemy on master has a combo breaker parry on the 4th (?) attack they take (but sometimes they decide that they will let you have some fun and won't do it) which makes almost every combo useless. Makes you wonder again what master difficulty purpose is.

Overall, I don't think I can recommend anyone play this on Master, however, Normal seems to be too easy to be an engaging a thoughtful experience. Despite this game's designers' best efforts I still had quite a bit of fun, so it could be that Normal is fine if you haven't played the game before, so it's probably a better way to play Sifu.",1680866989,1680866989,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

16 hours into this and i managed to beat the 2nd boss...
I loved Absolver and i love this one as well.

Keyboard and mouse integration works really nice and if this game is messing
with your muscle memories, just analyse your MM's and rebind everything to
your liking.

The Camera sometimes tends to be a bit messy, especially in the middle of
crowd control fights, or when micro'ed in a corner. But with mouse motion
you can rotate the angle so fast, that this is not really any kind of problem
if you can get used to it...

Overall: 
You liked those Survival Modes in every Beat 'em Up?
You liked some old fashioned Street Brawlers?
So chances are high you will like this one as well.

Watch the first trailer, this game reminds me Bruce Lee,Jackie Chan,IP Man,OldBoy film.I'm so hype when steam finally realease it.
100% complete achivement and review this game:
 Gonna say this game taught me a lot of things, from keep calm,stand up again and again after many times defeat and face every challenges. ""Failure teaches success"" is very suitable for this game. Martial arts, traning, learning not just your strenght but also your mind. Perseverance and never give up, just like in real life. 
Death counter punishment is incredible idea in this game, it makes me always want try again and try again for better score.
Story is short but it's something in this game, how should i say? i think it's amazing for a marital art game
Music is good, Hongkong's vibe somehow, i like it.
     *Very recommend this game*

It also does have a good amount of replayability with the way the game works, and the shortcuts oftentimes open up new pathways rather than merely skipping the old ones with a ladder or an elevator.

However, it's not perfect. The main issue I have is that the input for dodging grabs and sweeps feels very awkward. Parrying is fine, but the timing feels just barely too tight and oftentimes I feel like I get the timing right when the game still counts it as a regular hit. Some of the moves also have awkward inputs which don't seem to always work.

It feels just like a fantastic revenge story that I would watch in high school. Honestly my favorite things about Absolver were moved into a better single player experience.

If you haven't played Absolver the spiritual sequel to this game it is very much a clunky dark souls-esk version of this game. I say that in a good way as it filled a niche that was right in front of us with For Honor and medieval combat. High Paced Kung-Fu games with open world. I won't go into much on that game but if you like this game I really recommend people give it a try just for the game play and semi-open story. This game is basically a smooth version of that.

I have successfully played through the story 6 times now and haven't even started doing arcade just working on challenges and having fun with learning boss mechanics [spoiler](for instance if you didn't know you can catch the kunai from the Museum boss and throw it back right before she dashes to stun her)[/spoiler]. I cannot stress enough how much fun each boss mechanic is with phases and I didn't even know [spoiler] you could spare bosses [/spoiler] until my third play through.

I guess what I am saying is for a casual gamer this game really respected my time. I could pause during cut-scenes, if you die you have the ability to ""buy-back"" lives and missions aren't long enough to feel bad wanting to start over and had an open-ness for people who like exploring and collecting things.

Because for every moment I spent shouting at my monitor, once I had achieved my goals I was overcome by a sense of real achievement and satisfaction.

The learning curve is a sharp one and the game will constantly kick you on your ass until you learn to kick back. I do think there should have been a little more of a tutorial especially for some of the moves that you unlock later, but overall I think with a little persistence it is something that eventually comes naturally.

The combat system is beautifully crafted and never seems to get old. It looks good, it sounds good, and it almost always feels good and fluid, albeit with some occasional, minor setbacks. A lot of the progression in the game comes from you yourself improving as a player. You learn the move sets, timings, and points of interest though-out the game which is almost entirely what allows you to progress. You get further almost entirely because you get better. The majority of the permanent upgrades consist of just giving you more combat moves to add to your arsenal (rather than percentage upgrades of damage or health, etc).

The real highlight of the game which had me almost always in awe is the art style of the game. It's almost a hindrance that the 5 story levels look as good as they do as they were so positively distracting whilst I was fighting! The environment feels authentic, it feels alive and real. You can even interact with the environment as part of your violent crusade and it's obvious a lot of thought has gone into the design, not just aesthetically but functionally too!

My one complaint is that either im too goddamn slow or it seems impossible to deal with lows via dodging, which brings up the interlinked (interlinked) problem that you parry them but basically more than half of attacks cant be punished off off a parry and only a dodge. This is especially noticeable on bosses where youre essentially forced to do what the game wants you to do or youre so good at parrying (flawless execution if you parry everything your posture never gets broken) you avoid it all together. Oh yeah also, if you parry chains continue whereas if you dodge they do not so its a permanent barrage of attacks (unless theres one thats actually parriable stunning the enemy).

- Finished the game on Good and bad ending. Here's pros and con.
Pros
- Combat 
- Soundtrack and sound design.
- Artstyle

Con
- Camera: it's not that big deal for me but I think it probably be a big deal for others. So why is it bad? Because when you fight a big group of enemies the camera won't pan out. The FOV is not that wide and stick with our character too much. (I think there's a mod on Nexusmod that fix this problem.) And when you got cornered the camera zoomed in and you can't see what the enemy gonna do next.

Overall - Great game if you love to get kick in the arse.

If you enjoy a gameplay style that encourages you to be able to tap into a wide variety of skills in a moments notice, parry/posture/avoid mechanics, environmental utilization, roguelike, in a martial arts setting, then this game delivers excellently in all of these areas. I am amazed at the fluidity of this game and how rewarding it feels to switch between the above mentioned elements. After time spent in this game and getting my muscle memory down to where I don't necessarily have to think, just react, makes it SO fun. With the new update they have added a multitude of other modes. The game takes place over a series of levels which rise in difficulty and complexity as you progress through them, each stage ending in a boss you have to beat to proceed to the next level. Throughout the journey you will gain experience and a level score. The experience can be used to unlock new moves and if you purchase the move 5 times, you unlock it permanently to be used in all future runs. The level score is used to purchase roguelike elements that will expire if you die from age. One of my most favorite features is if you die during a level or perform poorly enough that you want to restart, you don't have to start from the beginning of the game, rather the beginning of the level you are on to try again. Aging stacks in a way where it is okay if you get KO'd here and there, but will severely punish you for repeated KO's in a short period of time as you age exponentially this way. I won't touch on the story, that's for you to enjoy, but I was not disappointed. Level design is fantastic and gives you the option to create room for yourself so you don't get overwhelmed. Soundtrack is very enjoyable. I don't just give a game 10/10 lightly, so with that said, the game is a masterpiece.",1680346404,1680588038,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So for Sifu to finally come out on Steam and being able to play it has been a dream come true. It has surpassed my expectations and I highly highly recommend this game for the following reasons:

[h1]Gameplay: 11/10[/h1]
The most important and impressive aspect of this game is its gameplay, which is weird to say, but needs to be stated in this world of 100 hour open world campaigns with even 100 more hours of cutscenes to sit through. This game sets up its premise rather quickly by letting you learn the basic controls through the prologue that doubles duty as a tutorial for its complex combat mechanics.

This is probably one of the most robust system I've played so far where not only do you have to learn a huge variety of moves and string them together into combos, but you also gotta learn how to use proper defense such as spacing, blocking, and parrying. In addition, you also have a typical dodge as you'd fight in any other brawler, though that's more used for spacing where the real meat of the dense is the Parry and Avoid system.

You COULD just block attacks, but doing that for too long will break your Structure, leaving you defenseless and open for huge attacks. What you wanna do more of is Parrying enemy attacks to break THEIR structures or at the very least, the cool looking Avoiding of High and Low attacks which leaves your character bobbing and weaving their head around to avoid head kicks and sweeps.

This is one of those games where it's easy to learn, but very hard to master, and while what they give you from the outset is already such a robust moveset, you can add to your repertoire by unlocking new skills that all have a huge variety of uses ranging from more crowd control to more efficient damage and more. 

To add to the game's combat is probably one of the best collision systems I've seen in a game where you can push your enemies into each other, even trip them over each other, AND you can make them accidentally hurt each other like if one is swinging a bat at you, and if you duck at the right time, they could end up hitting their own pals so that's always fun!

The limitless possibilities leave for a very dynamic experience in every fight you get into which can provide a ton of replay value. A lot of people bemoan that you can beat this game in 6 hours and if they just wanna be done with games that way, that's fine, you do you. If you don't think $40 is worth 6 hours of your time, then that's fine. But I would argue that to get the best out of this game is to replay its well structured 5 levels continuously learning new moves and tactics as you do, all the while experimenting with different buffs per run.

Yes, per ""run.""

You see, this game is also a bit of a rogue lite where you can buy certain skills for a run if you need them, but you need to buy them five times if you wanna unlock them permanently for your next run. And for each run you can also choose from a variety of buffs ranging from regaining more health per Takedown and recovering Structure health from Avoiding attacks.

So all in all it's the kinda game that the more you put into it the more you get out of it. Zipping through it in 6 hours is barely even scratching the surface of this game, and hey props to you if you can do it. But the fun in this game is learning how to do those 6 hours more efficiently, maybe even cut it down and some unlocked shortcuts throughout each level.

Yeah, the focus is on combat, but there's some minor exploration as you can get lore notes and keys to certain areas from one level for another which also adds to the replay value and possible speedrunning challenges.

To top this all of there's also a built in video editor where you can record your base gameplay and then apply different camera angles and effects to your fights to create some truly cinematic looking action. There's a lot of YouTubers out there actually who have made super entertaining short kung fu films because of this, myself included, and to be honest, at least 40 of my 60 hours on this game so far have been spent on the video editor. 

Anyways I've been going on and on, let's just that the TL;DR version of this is...

[h1]Story: 5/10[/h1]
A gang of martial artists have killed your father and you've spent eight years training for your revenge. As you hunt them down, if you happen to die, you revive and get older. The older you get, the harder you hit, but the less health you have. Pretty simple excuse for getting to beat up a bunch of people in a variety of different settings from the slums to a high class museum.

Anyways, there's not much to say other than the dialogue is thankfully sparse, though I wish there was just a bit more. My usual gripe with modern games is that the characters just don't STFU and keep talking endlessly about nothing before any actual plot point is made. This game is too straight forward to a fault and could have built on its characters a bit more.

But at the same time, as I mentioned, you can unlock lore related items that tell you a bit about the characters and a lot of their backstories are implied from their very own levels, lore notes, and even their sparse dialogue. Probably a breath of fresh air I really need in a day in age where I feel annoyed with cutscenes that go on forever.


[h1]Graphics: 8/10[/h1]
The artstyle is awesome and while there is some clipping and wonky paired animations, the stand out feature of this is the animations that nailed some great accuracy with various martial art styles and hit reactions that really sell the action. Not to mention, the level design is just immaculate giving so much character to the end level bosses you're swearing your revenge on. 


[h1]Sound: 6/10[/h1]
Unfortunately though, as good as the animations sell certain attacks, the sound effects that go with most of them do not feel impactful enough to truly sell them. They just sound like very light slaps instead of really punchy with a lot of bass and treble to emphasize the impact. Plus the music is more so serviceable for the situations, but not entirely memorable.

So with the great IGN level of math skills, I give this game an...

[h1]Overall Score: 11/10[/h1]
Despite the flaws in its sound design and animation processing, the gameplay really really makes up for where the game lacks in other areas. It really is super solid and addicting and I see myself quadrupling my current amount of hours in no time. 

This is the kind of complex fighting game I've wanted for a long time and I am eternally grateful that Slocap has made this game. It's literally everything I've wanted and more, and while I would have preferred a more closed fist fighting style to feature as the one you use, it's a minor gripe. It doesn't matter at this point. This game is just too damn fun to really nitpick apart for dumb little things like I did with its sound design and story scores.

The gameplay is too addicting and the video editor is such a great addition that I have gotten myself lost for many hours since release just finding ways to make the action look as epic as possible with a variety of different character mods from Daredevil to Desmond Miles. Ah yes...that's where the fun can continue as well...the modding community really helps keep this game even more alive and applying mods for this game is so simple.

Anyways, why are you still reading this long winded review? Go buy the game already if any of this intices you!",1680555843,1680574060,True,2,0,0.528907954692840576,0,True,False,False

With fighting games being a dying genre, Sifu is a game that makes fighting games what they are supposed to be. Fun and bad***. With 5 hard missions and 3 difficulties ranging from Student (Easy), Disciple (Medium), and Master (Hard). I played on Disciple and oh boy, this game is tough.

The main mechanic of this game revolves around death and age. From the start of the game you start at the age of 20, and every time you die, you get to come back to life.....but with this amazing ability.....there is a catch to this monkeys paw. The catch is when you come back to life you increase by 1 year (20 -> 21) and your age counter goes up by 1 until you fight certain amounts of enemies for the age counter to go down. So if you die again, you go from (21 -> 23) and so forth until you reach the age of 70 where you are officially dead. With this you must complete only 5 missions and beat the final boss all before you reach the age of 70. While it may sound easy, its not. Granted while the difficulty may shy most people away, death is your friend. As with the more you play the more your skills and age can carry over. So even if you do die, as long as you permanently unlocked a skill, you can always use it + re-try levels to beat it at a younger age and carry on over.

However, the combat is amazing. With its versatility. fluidity. and high-skill ceiling. You have many different ways to approach your enemies, you can dodge, ""avoid"", block, and parry your way through gangs of evil foes. The combat. is stylish and impactful that every hit you do feels like it has some sort of weight to it, the executions and the choreography is masterfully done that you never get bored of takedowns or movesets. The enemy/boss design has so much variety and spice that every fight is stimulating with the final boss being the hardest and the most satisfying fight.

Now some of the problems I had with this game which are nitpicks, are that there are some visual bugs and I wish there were more enemies in some areas. Also that they should have added in more moves. Like I said before, the movesets are fun. But I know there are so many moves in kung-fu that they could have added just a bit more. Other than that this game is a must play and while it is only 5 missions that could take you from 8 - 40hrs or maybe you might never even beat it, even if you don't like fighting games you should 100% try this.

Everything ive stated after my first impression still stands, the core combat is great but the greatest problem the game has is the avoid/dodge mechanic. For later fights it is essential to properly avoid multiple attacks just to get the chance for a counter attack, which is a problem considering how unresponsive the dodge can be at times. The last 2 bosses in particular are very problematic when it comes to this, where the second to last boss constantly pushes you away if you dont dodge her attacks perfectly and the last boss just throws multiple mechanics of the game out of the window just to make it ""harder"". That in combination of attack strings that all look very similar and are usually only distingt by ""he moved left or right before attacking"" and you suddenly have one of the worst simon says bosses in video game history
I havent tried the Arena mode out, so maybe that makes the game worth it, but the main story has to many problems for me to reccomend.

First Impression after 1 Hour:
Great Combat System, this game has the potential to be really great if it wasnt for the awful controls. Whoever decided that it was a good idea to put block and dodge on the same button deserves to get fired. You block by holding down LB/L1 and if you do it the moment an enemy strikes you parry, pretty standard so far. If you flick the stick up or down while holding block you evade instead highs or lows, very similar to how godhands dodge mechanic works. The problem is that the dodge often times doesnt come out. The reason for that is that where up or down is seems to be camera dependend, and the camera in this game is AWFUL.

First of all the actual combat system is way more complicated than it needs to be for this kind of game. The Sekiro stance meter makes an appearance, and is on paper a good addition, but ends up being most of the time an afterthought, and only really matters in boss fights.

Enemy attacks aren't distinctive at all - the difference between a parriable blow and one that sends you on your ass is practically impossible to see before it lands, or an enemy will either attack low or high, but pirouette the same direction beforehand.

Boss fights are absolutely the worst part of the combat, as you will spend the time standing completely still, dodging their attack sequence, land a few measly blows, and repeat.

Also, dying enough times has a permanent, stacking, health debuff! Sure because permanently gutting my already amoeba sized healthbar will surely not get in the way of my progressing this game. Can you reset levels? Suuuure but you lose your acquired skills and the debuff stays.

Like all good Kung Fu films, your master was assassinated and you are out for revenge by way of throwing kung fu hands.  Trick here is, you too were slain that faithful night, but thanks to a magic amulet you were reincarnated and trained for eight years to take revenge.  

If on this quest you should meet your end, you will be revived again only having aged a year, and so it goes.  Do very poorly in this game, your in game character will literally meet a game over due to old age.  

Of course you get levels, perks, and stat boosts throughout your quest to aid in your fists of fury.  One of my favourite options is you can play this game in cantonese or mandarin to add a bit more legit shaw bros flavor.  

The game is as hard as any soulslike though. Even on the easiest difficulty, unless you are skilled in the ancient video gaming martial art known as ""git gud"", you won't make it very far in your quest.  You will likely restart the game more than once as you learn boss patterns and level layouts.  

You should get Sifu is you are looking for a soulslike adventure on an indie budget and have fond memories of watching 80's and 90's hong kong films.  That's the person this game was made for.

And I agree.

It is more repetitive than fun.
It lacks of techniques even by unlocking the new ones.
It is sometimes spectacular but not that much.
And it is a lot of rinse and repeat because there is not that much of content so, another development choice has been made. 

The sound is not fantastic.
The visuals are nice. Nothing crazy as well considering what can be done today.

You should consider a good sales if  you intend to try it. Like 40% off bare minimum. This game is a bit below than average.


EDIT
---------
To add to this review since I played quite more.
My opinion did not change. For half the price of this game, you can get Midnight Fight Express. Ok, this last is not fully Wushu but your character will definitely acquire much more techniques. The disarms, the finish moves to name a few, all is better. The fun is then more important. And the maps are much more varied. The weapons as well. The tactics to get rid of your enemies multiplies with the environments.

When am I going to play a game where I can use a bench like Jackie?
Where is the lance? Where are the nun chucks? The double butterflies....
I did train with more weapons than this guy in my life....

There are hundreds of Kung Fu styles and schools. What you see in this game is mainly Wing Shun/Jet Kun Do. A bit limited in my opinion. And far to be the most funky of the styles if perhaps one of the most efficient/realistic in combat. 
I do not play a game for its realism but for its fun first.  Here it lacks. There is but not enough for the price.

Why for the guy in the toilet, I cannot break the sink with his head here?
Why bosses are just the intense repetition of the same technique. Every boss is a QTE. Even worst if you want the second ending...

3h is what is required to see most of its content. You extend only if you want to see the last bits of hidden content which are not playable ones. And if you want to spend some times in arenas passing some challenges while bearing handicaps.

Another detail, the game does not recommend first to play on easy mode. That is a bit sad, that is the most interesting mode. From normal, it becomes a festival of QTE. Move back to align the enemies, let them hit and block at the right time. Then chain with some hits till you can take them down. Do it again...
This character cannot even dodge differently than stepping backward. So, once you get cornered, you will first fight with your camera and then you will try to block just on time to get out of there. Multiple times of course.
Fall from 50cm high and you die. Try from the step of the dance floor in the club you will see.

So, yes. Same conclusion. A game to try and maybe enjoy following a big sales.",1680262075,1680348248,False,10,2,0.458026528358459473,0,True,False,False

Excellent beat-em-up that is held back by needlessly obtuse leveling mechanics. Mostly recommended.

1. When you die, you age. 
2. When you age too much, you lose access to level certain abilities.
3. When you die too much (independant from age), your lose access to level _other_ certain abilities.
4. Some abilities and powerups are learned by finding shrines in levels. Others are purchased by XP, some are not. Others can only be learned on death or in-between stages.
5. When you replay a stage, your progress is reset to what it was at the beginning of that stage.
6. You can unlock abilities permanently by purchasing it 5 times before you age out and die. 

Sound too complicated? It is. 

I believe you are meant to play as far as you are able to each run before aging out, and then go back and try again, hopefully with some permanent abilities unlocked. If you aim for a certain performance on each stage your first play through you will not have a fun time. 

I can recommend the game's combat and game flow, but these weird design decisions hold it back from being a game I can recommend to anyone. If you're on the fence, you probably should be, and wait for a good sale.",1680293825,1680293825,True,14,0,0.649513423442840576,0,True,False,False

It's not that it's ""too hard"" in an objective sense, because anyone who really puts their head down and grinds the systems will eventually be able to reach the end. I put in about 15 hours on the Epic store when it first came out and was able to beat the final level at 22 years old. But even if you *can* eventually ""git gud,"" the whole thing is just layered with so many pointlessly punishing design decisions that suck the fun out of what would otherwise be a great martial arts game. 

Everything about Sifu - the lazy roguelite elements, the incredibly narrow windows for blocks and parries, the huge number of enemies with unclear or easily misinterpreted attack telegraphs - feels like it was designed solely to add pain to every single mistake you make and require you to play absolutely flawlessly. It's just not possible to approach even the simplest encounters casually or with anything less than full attention. And some people might enjoy that, I guess, but for me it was just exhausting. I play games to have fun, and it feels like Sifu is designed with this very entitled attitude that assumes everyone is striving to be the most dedicated try-hard on the planet. Games should *earn* that level of engagement, rather than expecting it from the outset - but Sifu is obviously designed entirely around someone who has decided from the first minute that they're going to spend hours banging their head against the wall, rather than the (much larger) group of people who just want to be able to have a fun time with an inventive and dynamic combat system.

If you *are* someone who loves getting constantly beaten to a pulp by a wildly unfriendly and actively hostile game, you'll probably love this, and I know criticizing that will just get me a bunch of obnoxious comments from exactly that type of person. But I'm just tired of games that are designed to make people think to themselves, ""Wow, this is really hard!"" instead of actually being fun on a moment-to-moment level. I don't think anyone could actually defend the design decisions being made here just in terms of first-level enjoyment. I thought after a year or so of development, some of the roughest edges would have been sanded down.

In ""Sifu"", the player character is on a quest for revenge, and time is of the essence. The player must use their time wisely, mastering the combat system and progressing through the game's chapters efficiently in order to achieve their goal. Wasting time or failing to use it wisely can result in the player falling behind or failing to complete their objectives.

Similarly, in real life, time management is essential for success in any endeavor. Just as the player in ""Sifu"" must prioritize their actions and use their time effectively, individuals in the real world must also learn to manage their time in order to achieve their goals. This includes setting achievable goals, prioritizing tasks, and parrying efficiently.

Overall, the concept of ""time kills"" is a reminder to use one's time effectively and efficiently in order to maximize productivity and achieve one's goals.

It is similar to Batman and Spiderman games where you fight hordes of enemies one at a time with a flurry of counters and take downs by carefully timing button presses.

Half the difficulty was getting used to the controls and figuring out the invulnerability frames a lot of the enemies have.

When it comes to gameplay mechanics, Sifu has truly set the bar high, delivering a breathtaking experience that leaves players feeling like true martial arts masters. From the incredibly detailed animations to the stunningly smooth combat system, Sifu is a game that has managed to create a perfect balance between the art of martial arts and the world of gaming.

One of the most impressive aspects of Sifu's gameplay mechanics is the fluidity of combat. The developers at Sloclap have clearly put a significant amount of effort into creating a fighting system that is both accessible to newcomers and rewarding for experienced players. The controls are intuitive, allowing players to quickly pick up the basics and begin chaining together attacks in a satisfying manner.

The depth of the combat system is also noteworthy. Players will find themselves experimenting with a vast array of moves and combos as they progress through the game. This encourages creativity and keeps the combat feeling fresh and engaging throughout the entire experience. Moreover, the game's unique aging mechanic adds another layer of strategy, as players must carefully manage their resources and make smart decisions to avoid becoming too frail to continue.

The environments within Sifu are stunning, and the level design complements the gameplay mechanics perfectly. Players will find themselves navigating through intricate, maze-like environments, where every corner could potentially hold danger. This sense of exploration adds an exciting element to the game and ensures that players remain captivated by their surroundings.

One aspect that truly sets Sifu apart from other games is the incorporation of realistic martial arts techniques. This authenticity shines through in the gameplay, making the experience feel grounded and exhilarating. The developers have managed to create a game that captures the essence of true martial arts mastery, and it is evident in every punch, kick, and grapple.

In conclusion, Sifu is a masterclass in gameplay mechanics, providing players with a beautifully fluid and engaging combat system that will leave them feeling like true martial arts masters. The combination of intuitive controls, deep combat mechanics, stunning environments, and authentic martial arts techniques makes Sifu a must-play game for both newcomers and experienced gamers alike. This game is a shining example of how to perfectly blend art and gameplay, creating an experience that is truly unforgettable.",1680205942,1680205942,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, the game went from feeling like I'm a bad ass martial artist, to feeling like I'm tickling enemies with a feather. The last boss made me feel this especially, where it's just a fight of attrition. I thought maybe there was a mechanic I was missing, but when I looked up the fight, it was just doing the same thing over and over again for a long period of time. This game gets a negative review because of the artificial difficulty mechanic of ""how long can you do the same thing?"" I got so tired of dodging all my enemies attacks, and spending an entire minute hitting them with combos, just to be hit over the head with an average enemies attack to lose 50% of my hp. 

I just wish I didn't have to schedule a 6 A.M appointment with the final boss, to see if I can finish his first phase before it's time to head out to lunch from how little damage I'm doing.

I'm so happy that the dev team continued their fighting/brawling game vision because it is beautifully realized here in Sifu.

(as well as the toil of aging yourself from getting repeatedly beaten)

It's dynamic, challenging but not unfair, very cinematic and engaging. The art style is amazing, the animations are incredible. This game feels great to play, is extremely rewarding and satisfying when you succeed, and always gives you a chance to do better when you fail.

It is hard but not unfair. Be prepared to be challenged. You will need to learn the moveset, to learn to read your opponents, and mostly to learn how to defend yourself. No amount of back or sidedash will get you through this game, you need to learn to parry and dodge effectively and to make the best use of your moveset and the environment.

This game is a love letter to Honk Kong action movies, it's filled to the brim with references to so many classic movies, from the 70's SB movie intro style tutorial to climatic fights throughout the whole game. There's so much love and attention to details in this game, it's a treat from start to finish.

Purchased for the fourth ish time, it manages to share the short line for Absolver to sum it up: fighting in Video Games has NEVER felt better...It's a god damn masterpiece, my game of the year by levels that basically pushed everything else to who caresville, and I'm still playing it a literal year later.

But in the world where SIFU is out everywhere with all this new stuff; Oh, oh yeah, oh big big big time oh yeah's. 

THE COMBAT. That's all i have to say, because anything I put to words does the combat a disservice in an act of not doing it enough justice.  Just, i'll save you two paragraphs if you trust me- not exactly an authority on the matter, but go check my absolver hours, and, I am the type to break this kind of aspect of it down; it's the best one so far. In games, involving punching and kicking, that isn't a fighting game, which would then be absolver, for me. So actually I might even suggest the true gungfu game fan buy both as they do compliment each other very nicely. The difficulties, the modifiers, the goals, all of them excellent excuses to replay the game after normal mode and on hard mode, oh, you just try and front like it's not challenging to me and I will say hats off to you. Now do it without dying. That's the idea, right, well, if you beat it, make it harder,  that skill cieling just goes up. Then, make them faster in the toggle, make them hit harder, make slowmo and focus attacks and pendant (revive) disabled for yourself, turn off the hud, get some good footage, learn to ORCHESTRATE that fight because, you've trained 8 years for this.

 This is the best melee has ever felt in video games, because it treats it  with even more cinema structure than Absolver had, and then, does it again, and again, every single run, same level or not, every good fight is worthy of that included replay editor.

Absolver was my favorite game ever, this is the first game to come along and make that a really tough pick between the two. Not to say that this is Absolver Single player, in's more like, video game martial arts: The tribute art piece, and every room, as well as every decision per punch, is MORE beautiful, the more you play, instead of less. I put 500 hours in on epic, I put 200 hours in on Playstation, lets see what I can get up to here, and how many replay edits I can post, how many nexus mods we can collectively make now that it's on steam

 Buy this video game. Just, refund it if you have to,  I'm telling you, dude, buy this video game. Don't be a silly and miss this one, it will humble you into skilled fighting such that every encounter becomes a dance floor, every move an opportunity to chain into another idea. A moving chessboard of flying punches and moving your queen and retaliation, a skateboard sim for martial arts.

My game of the year 2022, and possibly game of all time, a little brother to Absolver that is louder, more focused, single player with a non-linear story and player driven choice narrative with a story that is more about yin, and yang, than it is about revenge, and as a martial artist, I thought absolver would be the best representation for combat in games and sloclap would go on to something else; and from the early trailers to what it is having completed it several times over, it excels and provides enough content and challenge and unique encounter per run on positioning, strategy, reflex, this is where shenmue, godhand, a tale of revenge trope, using some tropes from cinema like the raid most famously in the reveal trailers, but making all of that as real as a game can make a punch coming at you feel, and response in turn feels that much better. Humble yourself, and THINK as you strike, don't hesitate, flow state.

* Lastly, The John Wick director snatched those rights for a film up on HIS initiative, not the other way around. If you can't infer what I mean by that, well, he certainly liked it. Hey, me too.
. If you're unaware; this game is highly, HIGHLY moddable, total conversion style, new levels, entire character custom imports, moveset swaps and custom movesets, camera alteration, reshade perfect, and some of the best checkpointing in video games I've ever encountered for both modders, and ragey alt f4 deaths. Those, by the way, go away, you learn that the FIGHTING is the fun, not the winning.

Beat it in 2.4 hours on steam release so I could review it with a fresh perspective.

In my opinion, sifu is one of the best action games currently available to play, and don't let my hasty completion of the game fool you, the game isn't easy.

The biggest plus of the game is the engaging gameplay loop, followed by very responsive controls. Little to no input delay, and what helps with this is that you can animation cancel every single move in the game with a dodge or parry, the only way youll miss it generally is if you make a mistake, or if 2 enemies are attacking at the same time.

The game has a rogue-lite + ""dark souls"" feel to it.

Rogue-lite because of how progression works: 
Moves: You start off with a few moves but can unlock more, and if you put enough exp into a move, you unlock it forever. If you don't perma unlock an ability, you lose it when you game over.

Shortcuts: There are several shortcuts in the game that you get keys for by progressing in the game. Typically you will get shortcuts for previous levels, as to encourage you to re run previous levels to have a better age for the later levels.

Death: Death is also an aspect of the rogue-lite feel, as whenever you die, your age increases, which increases damage dealt but decreases your total health. If you die after hitting age 70 then it's game over for you.

The ""Dark Souls"" feel is due to how the game forces you to learn. The main philosophy behind dark souls isn't about having a difficult game, but rather, making a fair challenge for the player to overcome. Sifu does this very well, as all of the enemies, and bosses especially, will whoop you at first, but once you mentally slow down and start to read their attacks, it clicks and you can end up overcoming the enemies in a very glorious fashion. Makes you feel like Neo from the matrix but you arent buffed by being the chosen one, you just got better at the game.

The base game, pre updates, was pretty good as is in my opinion, and I got about 60 hours out of the base game.

What got me all of those hours was first, beating the game, about 10 hours for me. Then to get all of the moves perma unlocked was a few hours of grinding, idk how many but it didnt really take that long.

What took me a good long time to do, was beating the game at age 20.

Beating this game at age 20 will harden your soul, and test your resolve, because not all of these encounters are created equal, some are much harder than others, and when you're trying to get through the entire level without dying, you really get dialed into the gameplay, both the offense and the defense.

It was extremely satisfying to finally beat the game at level 20. It felt like I had overcome a huge obstacle, and that all of my practice and learning paid off when I defeated the last boss without dying. I had mastered the game.

Sloclap wasn't done though, and they added in some wild content I never imagined. First, the photo mode/ recording mode. A set of features that should be in most games, and isn't even found in most triple A games. 

Next, they added in a new modifier system, a challenge system, and some new outfits.

Modifier sytstem: You can change the rules of the game to be easier, or harder. Easier would be something like enemies deal less damage, you spawn with a weapon that can't break, etc. Harder would be enemies can attack through your block, you cannot heal, etc. It's there to customize your experience if you want to.

Challenge system: hand in hand with the modifier system and some of the outfits. Unlocked after you beat the game, whenever you complete a challenge you receive coins, which you can then use to unlock modifiers. Other challenges will unlock a few outfits (as of 3/29/23)

Outfits: I don't need to explain this. But what I do need to explain is that some of the outifts change as you age ingame, cool detail.

Then Sloclap decided, they still arent done, and with the steam launch, also game a brand new way to play: Arenas.

These are cool, as of writing the review I only completed 1 arena to get an idea as to how it played.

The arenas are pretty much a variety of game modes that you can play, in a bunch of new combat areas.

The one I played was a wave based mode, where various enemies were sent to me, and I had to complete the arena with as few deaths as possible. It was fun.

From what I have seen, there is also a King of the hill type game mode, and a beat up certain targets game mode.

Something like this is really cool for the game, I never anticipated a game modes type of content update, but Sloclap did it and they did it well. This update also includes new outfits to unlock.

I follow them on twitter, and this is confirmed to not be the last update. Currently there is plans to drop more arenas and outfits to the game.

So, are you convinced? If you like third person action games, you shouldn't pass this one up. It's awesome, and the base price is just $40 too. This game has modern polish, support, and gameplay, it's well worth the asking price.

Did 5 hours in one sitting as soon as it dropped, and honestly -
this update added a lot of replayability with the (Steam) day-1 drop.  
The arenas are so fun, with new maps and I think even some new OSTs!  

To succinctly explain the game for those that don't know much about it - 
it's a MASTERPIECE in fighting games, with a pretty nice story and a brilliant feeling of [i]learning[/i] from your mistakes. 
Also pretty novel death counter idea, you're basically guaranteed to not finish the game in ""one go"" as is standard. 

But that's the leitmotif of the game - mastery. You will redo the same levels, getting better at them both mechanically and by unlocking more skills along the way. 
You will learn the enemy patterns, you will start parrying everything, you will cease to die as much as you did originally.

In the end, you will avenge your sifu, your late father.

Do you want to feel like you're the main character in Oldboy, Ip Man, The Raid, or any of your other favorite kung fu / action movies? Then get this asap. It's a great beat em up, with good enough difficulty to really make it feel like a challenge (unlike many of the other beat em ups where every single guy is just weak ass cannon fodder)

If you came here from their previous game, Absolver, you might recognize a lot of the moves, as well as the avoid mechanic from the Windfall style. However, other than copied animations and the dodge, it's an entirely different game. Still love it for what it is though.

If you care about replayability, this game is a bit weaker. There's a 'true ending' that requires completing the game twice, but other than that, there's not much to keep you there if you don't simply like replaying the levels. There's some goals to complete on old stages to unlock new outfits, and some arena challenges, but those only last 5 waves for now. No 'roguelite' procedurally generated levels or anything of the sorts.

So if you're looking for a good beat em up, this one should definitely be on your list. I got this again even though I already own it on Epic. That should say enough I guess. :)",1680032130,1680032395,True,6,0,0.521135926246643066,0,True,False,False

[quote=Starscream]The Epic store is garbage. I hate it. So I pirated Sifu until it came out on Steam. Ethics and laws don't matter in this world to a transformer anyway. Sifu is a great game, reminds me of when I defeated the Autobots at Sherman Dam.[/quote]

[b]Sifu[/b] is the best damn thing to come out of the human world since the invention of [i]energon cubes[/i]. It's like they made a [i]Bruce Lee[/i] simulator just for me. This game is so immersive that it made me forget how much I hate humans for a few hours. As a Decepticon warrior, I never thought I'd find a game that could make me feel like the legendary Bruce Lee. But then I played [b]Sifu[/b], and I was hooked faster than you can say ""Autobots, roll out!""

The fighting mechanics in [b]Sifu[/b] are top-notch. Every punch, every kick, every move feels like it has weight behind it. The game has a learning curve that will challenge even the most seasoned Decepticon warriors, but it's worth it. The feeling of satisfaction when you finally take down a tough opponent is energon-inducing.

The graphics and sound design in [b]Sifu[/b] are also something to be praised. The game has a distinct style that reminds me of [i]Megatron's[/i] early designs. The environments are detailed and immersive, and the sound effects make every hit and impact feel visceral.

But what sets [b]Sifu[/b] apart from other fighting games is its focus on storytelling. The game follows a young fighter on his path to avenge his family, and it's told in a way that feels like a gritty, human version of the [i]Transformers: The Movie[/i] (the one from 1986, not that [i]Michael Bay[/i] garbage). The story will keep you engaged from start to finish.

[list]
 [*]Sifu is like the ultimate Bruce Lee simulator, it's like you're really him kicking ass and taking names.
 [*]The game mechanics are so fluid and responsive, just like the movements of a skilled martial artist.
 [*]The difficulty level is just right, challenging enough to keep you engaged but not frustratingly hard.
 [*]The combat system is well-designed and versatile, allowing for a wide range of moves and combos to unleash on your enemies.
 [*]The game's visuals are stunning, with beautifully rendered environments and characters that look like they just stepped out of a kung fu movie.
 [*]The soundtrack is epic, with pulse-pounding music that gets your blood pumping and makes you feel like you're in the middle of an intense fight scene.
 [*]Sifu has a compelling story that draws you in and keeps you hooked until the very end.
 [*]The game has a great replay value, with plenty of unlockables and secrets to discover.
 [*]Sifu captures the essence of martial arts and delivers an authentic experience that will satisfy both fans of the genre and newcomers alike.

[/list]

In conclusion, [b]Sifu[/b] is a must-play for any Decepticon warrior looking for a good time on Earth. It's like the [i]Arkham[/i] games, but for [i]Bruce Lee[/i] fans. It's the best damn [i]Bruce Lee[/i] simulator out there, and it'll make you feel like a true Decepticon warrior.

And if you're a fan of [i]G1[/i] Transformers like I am, you'll find plenty of energon to sustain you in [b]Sifu[/b].",1680012998,1680024465,True,9,5,0.561306178569793701,2,True,False,False

[url=https://www.pcgamer.com/kung-fu-game-sifu-will-be-singleplayer-only-all-about-mastery-through-practice/] The main concept of the game is honing your skill as a player through practice and adversities the game throws at you.[/url] Thus let's look at the game through the lens of the developers' presentation of their project. Since the devs have a very clear vision of their product, which mostly doesn't align with the modern game design, it has to be said that this game is not meant to appeal to the masses.

Sifu is a third-person beat 'em up, which successfully incorporates a few ideas from Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, which, apparently, are becoming the next trend in the industry, and a peculiar iteration of Freeflow Combat, popularized by the Batman Arkham series, with a few additions and changes.

[b]Pros:[/b]

+ [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHaODlf6FIc&ab_channel=Sloclap]Complex and deep combat system[/url]:

1) A plethora of defensive mechanics, which absolutely have to be used properly depending on the situation: avoid, dodge, block and deflect. The base of the defensive gameplay is the Structure Gauge, which is affected by blocking and deflecting like this: when you get hit while blocking, the Structure Gauge is getting filled and upon reaching its maximum, the player gets stunned, which most likely will lead to death. Deflecting is basically a perfectly timed block achieved by blocking right before the hit would land. Not only this move doesn't fill the Structure Gauge, but also allows the player to perform effective counter attacks. Each successful Avoid reduces the Structure Gauge meter. Dodges have no effect on the Structure Gauge, but are useful for strategic repositioning during the fight. Such interactions stimulate the player to actively watch their defense status and make the right decisions, as ignoring these mechanics or using them incorrectly will lead to defeat, which in turn will lead to frustration. This specific unforgiving approach to combat makes this game accessible to smaller audiences, but it doesn't make it bad though.

2) The offensive arsenal is also rather varied: many various strikes, which you can tie into combos, throws, focus-attacks (effective special attacks, which spend special points meter), the ability to partially use the environment and 3 types of melee weapons. Overall, there are plenty of ways to improve your skill. [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2KlxhgYo3c&ab_channel=LiquidDrone] This the the highest level of mastery that I've seen at the time I was writing this text, although obviously you should watch it only if you don't mind the spoilers.[/url]

• Many references to martial arts movies.

• The high barrier to entry.

• [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eCCJJ9CCHM&ab_channel=Sloclap]Rather controversial Aging System.[/url] The thing is that the game starts off when the main character is 20 years old. Every time you die, the character is magically resurrected, but ages 1 year. Every subsequent death adds a year to the total death counter, so if you die at age 21 with the counter showing 2 deaths, you get back to life and turn 23 now. The following death adds another one to the counter making it 3 total, and if you die again you're adding 3 years to your current age, which is 23 so you get back to life and turn 26, and so on. It might sound complicated but in practice it's much simpler. Aging 10 years reduces the character's health, but increases the damage output. Although, the main problem most players will face is reaching 70 years of age, which is the final life you get since dying at this age is permanent and sends you back to the start of the level and you're resurrected with the age you entered the level at. Thus, you need to play as clean as possible and avoid unnecessary deaths at all cost to beat this game. Though, considering the overall harshness of the game, this is easier said than done for an unprepared player, which might become a reason to quit, since not everyone will be interested in replaying the same levels to improve their personal scores. It would've been easier to manage that if Sifu had been a full-fledged roguelike, but the devs made it easier by adding an easy mode (Student) a little while after the release.

• The game is a real gem for speedrunners or players who like to improve their own scores. 

• There are various types of collectibles scattered around the levels, which immerse the players into the game's lore. You can also find keys for opening the shortcuts, which are useful for future replays.

[b]Cons:[/b]

- Sometimes the camera selects suboptimal angles which block the view. This is unacceptable for a beat 'em up where you're supposed to keep your eyes on each and every brawler and control the crowd properly.

[b]Incredibly stylish, skill-dependent and absolutely unforgiving indie-action with a wonderful combat system, which you might not be able to beat, but it's undoubtedly worth trying.[/b]
