Here's some things I enjoyed and things I didn't enjoy:
First of, I think that the fights with the combine soldiers aren't fun. They're mostly annoying and not very entertaining. They fell quite slow and sloppy. The fights with zombies and other Xen-enemies are quite fun however.

Looting and exploring the environment is fun, but eventually gets boring. In the beginning it's very fun looting, exploring, and interacting with the environment in other ways. Such as breaking bottles, throwing around chairs and other objects for example. I think that that makes the game quite fun. But, it eventually gets old and not as fun.

Puzzles aren't fun. I don't like all those environmental ""puzzles"" where you have to do something slightly tricky to proceed. They're slightly fun when you get the ""aha!"" feeling. But it doesn't make up for the fact that I found it more annoying than what I found it fun. The hacking and looting doesn't feel rewarding enough either in my opinion.

In conclusion, I just found it more annoying and frustrating than what I found it fun. But, I still haven't beaten it yet, so I might change it later on. I would give it a 4,5/10 right now.",1707587324,1708893579,False,3,1,0.537275075912475586,0,True,False,False

Wish we could have a sequel to Half Life 2, but I'll take this prequel. In fact, the only reason I got VR was for this specific game, and I don't regret it. 

Valve does a good job of designing a movement system that mitigates nausea. ""Teleportation"" and snap-turns mitigates the risk of nausea to basically zero. I had no problems playing this game with this option turned on.

Playing on VR does make the game more challenging. You would think moving around and shooting would be more intuitive with VR, but it's the opposite. Movement, especially if you are trying to shoot at the same time, is waaay more difficult with VR. But this is not a criticism of the game itself, just of VR in general.

If you've already got a VR headset, I highly recommend this game. If you don't already have a VR headset, and you if have more money than you know what to do with, go ahead and buy the VR headset just for this game. If you're on a tight budget, save your money for something more important than a video game. VR just doesn't add enough to the experience to make the cost worth it, and it comes with significant drawbacks. Again, this is not a criticism of the game itself, but it's important to point out the flaws of VR to prospective VR players.",1708790511,1708790511,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Valve has such class. They shadowdrop watershed titles and disappear back into the ether before anyone even notices. They're like the kid in class who goes first and just completely upstages any act that's supposed to follow. Alyx is the best VR game because it was purpose-built to be the best VR game.

[h2] “Xen Garden” [/h2]
- It’s full fledge Half Life experience in franchise and it’s a crime its hostage of being “killer app” for VR. Source 2 is cool, visually it’s great, absence of RTX is not a problem when you have top-notch environment artist team, alien flora of Xen from Black Mesa feels amateurish and lame in comparison with new Valve version.

- Its good they crossed the line of being afraid working on HL franchise, and rewriting whole story with old/original writer’s was right call as its (story) and banter between Alex end Russell are highlights of the game, rare display of cool dialogs from west company when there no activists in writing room.

[h2]“Blast From the Past”[/h2]
- I personally now don’t get notion that Valve will only make HL game if it will be breakthrough in gameplay innovation, is HLA have innovation’s ? Not playing VR version I may speculate, yes of course, but only for VR space in way classic gameplay interactions converted in meaningful and smooth way to became golden standard for VR. 

- Playing “Flat” version its clear there are zero innovation in Actual gameplay, the same old tricks and pieces from 20+ history of linear single player games, 1 type of 3D puzzle that works as intended only in VR is not an argument, downgrade into pixel hunt for ammo across environments and serious downgrade for weapons because VR have its own limitations. My personal position that they already made just great HL game without actual innovations and VR conversion is on sideway relevant only for future of VR as platform.

[h2]“I Hate You Jeff”[/h2]
- Also on the note of poking HLA’s gameplay with the stick, I think horror masters Frictional Games in its SOMA (2015) already said ALL about “eight shape loop” design where you can’t kill monster/s and only have to avoid it. Putting player as squirrel in the loop for whole chapter and not giving option to kill/stale bugger with weapons is Lame in 2020+ in my opinion.

[h2]“Textbook Jinxing”[/h2]
- How good NoVRMod ? It’s Good enough for full play through if you not afraid bugs and not perfect hand animations. Serious bugs appear after around one third of play through, just not be afraid of using no clip for flying through walls, I got around 7 critical walkthrough blockers (usually broken scripts), so it needed around 4 no clip fly’s and 3 reloaded checkpoints to progress. Also some hand animations and how animation are blended at the moment can be janky or buggy, and I assume some hand interaction can be completely absent, so in general I would say it (Mod) may be still cooking in oven for a year to a polished state.

[h2] “Crustacean Frustration”[/h2]
- Also there was claim that it is too easy in “flat” variant so I was expecting walking simulator experience, and oh, boy how it is wrong. I don’t know, maybe mod team made already rebalance but I had literally at least 4 situations where I was at edge of no ammo, and there is no melee at all…, so no ammo can mean you’re done, game over man. Sometimes it was proper horror survival experience that I initially didn’t sign up for. In conclusion, I don’t think there is need for any difficulty mods from workshop.

[h2]“On a Roll”[/h2]
- Its definitely worth playing, in age of live services no one asked for, good old-school single player experiences are rare, even if it’s in some places inferior modded version, there is no reason to wait if you want to, except mod became even better.

[b] PS [/b]

- For those who remember how HL2 EP2 ends, end of the HLA story hypes everything to the moon, they’d better not to cancel HLX (2026?), after such reinvigoration of fan base.

- Looking on ultra-cool sci-fi designs of combine soldiers, I see a ton of cosmetics for micro-transactions in upcoming Neon Prime (2025?)",1708617896,1708617925,True,0,0,0.470395505428314209,0,True,False,False

There is a MASSIVE difference between watching footage shot through a single eye of VR (which is what the game puts on your monitor for someone other than you to see) and actually being in the game playing. Can you get sick? Sure, but this only tends to happen when your eyes and brain are out of sync with the content coming into them. If you push on, and ignore your body, you will pay heavily. If you are on the fence, I suggest going to a local VR gaming center if you have one nearby and ask to play this game. I think you will be really surprised at the results. The game needs to be played using VR and not the mod. The mod cuts out VR content you cannot emulate, so you miss out on stuff. 

Give this a try before you just think you are not able to play the game in VR. The tech has come so far in the last few years; the displays are high-refresh with tiny pixels. This gives your brain a far more realistic view to the content you are watching/playing. 

If you are new to VR, the HL or HL2 story, or know zero about anything, you will find things to love about this title and the story within. 

Pros:
[X] Story Telling is on Point! You will come to love the banter on the radio between Russell and Alyx or some of the other people or beings you meet along the way. You don't need to skip cut-scenes or storytelling here. 

[X] Price: Worth Every Penny - No need to wait for this to be on sale. You are getting a game that expands on HL2 in ways you will love and you can learn about things that happened prior to other folks joining the game's story. If you do not have a VR headset, watch someone play the game just to see what the story is!

[X] Controls: Super Well Done VR Controls - No Gripes Here!

[X] Motion Sickness: This game will not make you sick with movement and the best type of motion is using the left control stick to move you and the right to snap-turn. Suggest 15-degree snap setting for more control.

Cons:

{] I honestly do not have MAJOR concerns, but since VR headsets are still making jumps in their per-eye resolution, I would love to see higher-res texture packs and native ray tracing in the game.

If anyone just picked up a meta quest 3 like I did, I highly recommend this game as your first introduction to VR. The story, the immersion, the combat, everything is top tier. I was hooked the entire experience. It was not something I wanted to rush through at all. I took my time to admire all the environments and search the hidden areas looking for extra loot. It has been so long since I have taken the time to play through an entire game. I found myself looking forward to go home and hop back into the Half-Life: Alyx story. I truly have not felt this way about a game since I was a kid. I love how the game is somewhat physically demanding you to crouch and even to get entirely prone to move through certain obstacles. The combat is super immersive as well. Having to utilize cover and maneuver through fire fights was a great experience. This game is a great blend between semi-horror themes (head crab guys), shooting rounds at fascist-like soldiers and solving unique and creative puzzles. The weapon customization and upgrades are awesome as well. Taking the time to find extra resin really pays off when you have your favorite weapon completely decked out, mine simply being the pistol. The only part of the game that I disliked was the part where you encounter Jeff. In retrospect I understand why this part was thrown in since it forces you to take your time to really figure out how to get out of the situation you're in. Overall this is one of my favorite games I have ever played. I love the fact that valve has no pressure to release Half-Life 3 and would happily wait 5+ years for the release. Its clear that they truly take their time with this masterpiece of a series and I can not wait to someday finally take a crowbar to the G-Mans face (:",1708358237,1708358237,True,1,0,0.501976311206817627,0,True,False,False

After personally waiting four entire years since release, to get a capable pc and a vr headset to play this game, i love this game. So far this is my first vr game i’ve played and i can tell it had a lot of love put into it to ship a valve singleplayer game once again.

Gameplay feels really nice and i seriously love using the gravity gloves (Sometimes my dumbass tries to do the gesture irl after stopping after 2 hours), shooting feels nice and i love the interactivity of stuff.

I do personally have a large bias towards the weaponry as if a game has a pistol in it, i try to use it for as long as possible. I really do enjoy using pistols in games and this game doesn’t disappoint me in that.

Graphics imo aged really well, after me following several vr game releases came out after hl:a, i think alyx aged the best out of them all, then again i am waiting for the new metro vr title to ship, as it looks like something half life alyx graphically, or even better.

Only two issues i have with hl:a is some of the weird bugs it has, like my hands not showing up due to me using quest 2 controllers. And the lack of the promised sdk for the game.. shame it never released..

Half Life Alyx is the best VR game I've played so far. It totally redefines what VR can and should be like. Controls are very intuitive and realistic, immersion is great, optimization is great, graphics are great. 10/10.

And story-wise (no spoiler), that's a great missing piece that happens in between Half Life 1 and Half Life 2. You'll get to know more of Alyx's, Elie, Freeman and some more. However, as usual with Half Life, it raises as many questions as it answers. Still want HL3.

Side note regarding VR: No need for a Valve Index or PCVR only headset in order to play it, you can have a great experience with standalone devices that do PCVR, like a relatively cheap Pico 4 (the one I have) or a Quest 2 or 3.

I can't overstate how immersive this game is and how well engineered it is for VR.  The game opens on an apartment balcony overlooking City 17, and I spent at least 30 minutes there just interacting with the environment, picking up objects and manipulating them - incredible!  Moving inside the apartment, I saw some pens, picked them up and found I could write on the windows!

So much attention to detail and fantastic gameplay.  It can be quite stressful at times when the enemies are attacking you and you have to crouch behind cover and reload you weapon.

It's a true blue Half-Life game, just as rich and engaging as any other. It got me caring about the story and lore more than any other Half Life game before it. I truly hope we can look forward to more VR titles of this quality in the future.

If I had to come up with some complaints, outside of the frustrating limitations of VR in the current year (I want to run around and jump freely and not worry about my headset or the room I'm in, damn it), I'd say the game doesn't go hard enough with the difficulty. Once you get used to the gun reloading mechanics and movement, this game becomes mostly very easy, Even on the hard difficulty. I frequently found myself with excess healing items and the like, and the combat encounters were either a snooze fest, or a frustrating instakill fest. For some reason, dying in VR is way more frustrating than dying in front of a screen with a mouse and keyboard. The long long load times after every death don't help.

But this is getting too negative. Overall, this is one of the best games I've played in a long time, VR or no, and I wish more people could play it and see how incredible it is.

And wow, i drew penis on the windows, thre everything i could down the balcony, stood and looked around, and every event and i mean those small ones where a ship flys over, characters doing stuff ect, i just watched. And i love every moment of it. 

Its incredible, theres a scene in the beginning where the combine  stops you trapping you in an elevator. I just stood and checked out the insaine detail on the guns, armour ect.

If you like halflife, you owe it to yerself to play it in vr. You will love every single second of the experience. You will see a level of detail you otherwise wouldnt pay attention to. So much more of the world of hl its insaine.

And its valve, and if u know valve, u know how they feel about details.

I played about 3 hrs, and i started to feel a bit weird in the body, so thats a cool aspect aswell, you physicly cant do those 10 hr playthroughs. And i like that.

I mean for the game, its halflife, 
The sounds of the combine just make you emotional, shooting them insainly happy, and for the scary parts, its 100% more scary
Cause vr grabs a hold of more senses in your body and screws with your mind.

Come get yer Halflife fix. Become one of us,

My guess is that it has a little to do with the scale of objects, which feels overall some of the best I've seen but can still be a bit wonky. 

The gameplay, from exploration to combat to cinematic moments feels really great. There are only a couple parts, mostly later in the game, that get a bit frustrating and feel a little dumb.

Three and a half years later, oh my god, that choice was SO worth it.

As my first VR game, this is unlike anything I've played before, and probably will be ever since. It's clear that it was made to lean into the strengths that VR has from the ground up, and it makes for an incredibly unique and memorable experience.

I highly recommend playing in VR (not the PC mod) if you can afford a headset, or know someone you could borrow one from. On mouse and keyboard this just won't hit the same.",1707254534,1707254534,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I know its been almost 5 years since initial release of Half-Life Alyx but not much has changed. It is still one of the most if not the most advanced VR games. Visually it looks stunning, the storyline is great as always, although i have to note that i am considering myself a Half-Life series fan. But honestly the game is just great. All the mechanics all the attention to details and interactions feel really smooth. The graphics are stunning and it is all heavily optimized.

First i tried it couple years ago on Meta Quest 2 and it was an amazing experience. recently i tried it on Meta Quest 3 and it was even better, everything looks so clear and smooth, even tho because Quest 3 gives much clearer image you can start to see some small imperfections if you could call them that way. Because you see things very clearly you can see sometimes how mesh LODs are changing, but other than that its all perfect.

Another thing that i noted was the soundtracks, they sound just great, I was so happy that VALVE managed to keep the same style of soundtracks from their earlier games like Half-Life 2, Half-Life 2 Episode 1 and Half-Life 2 Episode 2, the soundtracks sound like they were made by Kelly Bailey even though they are not.

Long story short here is the list of things i have rated:

1. Gameplay - 10/10 - Overall gameplay is simple and smooth, everything is intuitive and still has that Half-Life vibe.
2. Music and audio - 10/10
3. Gunplay - 8.5/10 Its realistic, it is good and smooth, personally i think weapon sounds and recoil could be more realistic and punchier, but again its is not some realistic shooter so that is fine
4. Graphics - 10/10 - Its been almost 5 years since this game was release and i have not seen any game come close to it in terms of graphics.
5. Level Design - 10/10 - Everything looks natural and simple and nothing is confusing.
6. Story - 9.75-10/10 - The story itself is really good and everything is fine, it was interesting to see the game from Alyx Vance perspective, although the scene after credits has shown us alternative reality, hinting to infinite alternative universes, i guess such thing would give developers more freedom if they are planning to make another Half-Life game, i am not sure how i feel about this but i am more than sure that VALVE knows what they are doing.

This time, you're Alyx (didn't see that coming), in a journey through Xen-infested, Combine-controlled environments, saving your father and getting to the super-weapon concealed in The Vault. The campaign is about 15 hours long, and can be extended with mods from the Workshop.

Many elements from previous Half-Life games return in this entry, to the point that some parts of the game try to exactly replicate environments from previous entries. Gnome Chompski is one such feature, but at least this time he's much easier to transport.

The combat is enjoyable and tense in some spots, and there are new and returning enemies to find, as well as many (honestly, filler) holographic puzzles, however, the story and immersive presentation are the real kicker. The audio design is also dramatically improved, and despite most returning character voice actors being new, they did a perfect job.

[hr][/hr]
Just to address a few technical things:

The NoVR mod is not worth the time, not unless the game is played in VR first. It would ruin the first experience for such a massive title where the core idea is that it's a VR game, where interactions aren't dumbed down to pressing a button, your accuracy is determined by the ability to aim with your own hands, and it is paced such that the player is expected to take a look around instead of running through levels.

The Linux version works reasonably well*, however, playing the game may require replacing some libraries due to static linking and the libraries becoming out of date.

That means here in 2024, I’m an even much older fanboy—who, unfortunately, also has intermittent vertigo problems and suffers from severe motion sickness if I’m not careful. So, if I were ever going to be able to play Half-Life: Alyx, it would never be in its native VR form. Ah, getting old ain’t for sissies, as they say. Thanks a lot, Valve.

That’s why I was out-of-my-mind excited to hear about the Alyx NO-VR mod. I would finally be able to jump back into the dystopia that is City 17 and get gunned down by the Combine--before I croak in real life, that is. Now that I’ve made my way through the entire game using the NO-VR mod, I thought I’d write a little…update?

I won't extensively review the game. Plenty of other reviews here. But if you are reading this because you are also a longtime HL fan who can’t (or won’t) strap a contraption to your head but want to play the game, here’s my short advice: DO IT! The mod works. You can play the game from beginning to end sitting 12 feet away from a flat screen (or on your couch in front of ye ole’ TV box) and not vomit. Some of the VR-heavy functions in the game have been simplified (or removed) for flat-screen use, but the big, overall narrative experience, high-tension firefights, and creepy locations are still lovingly in place. Sure, it’s not the same innovative experience as it is in VR I guess, but also…you know…no vomit, no having to lay down for an hour to make the room stop spinning. Anyway, the game looks amazing (even now, 4 years after release), and the story and actors are as good as ever. The NO-VR mod has added in workable character models (hands, arms) and reload animations so it plays like a classic HL FPS. Maybe it’s my nostalgia talking, but wow.

However since the NO-VR mod is…well…a MOD, my recommendation has caveats. So as of February 2024, here are the hurdles I (quite happily) had to jump as I played through the HL: Alyx NO-VR mod. Since the mod is in active development, I expect many (or all) of these issues will get resolved (if they haven’t been fixed already).

GENERAL ADVICE: 1) SPAM THAT QUICKSAVE BUTTON. There are some technical issues with the current build of the NO-VR mod (again, we’re talking Feb. 2024 here…read below) that could be frustrating. Saving often helps soften those problems. There is a decent Steam community controller mod (if you play with controller) which works well, but I personally made one major configuration change to that community controller setup: I assigned the quicksave function to a single button on my controller so I could always have fast access to it. 2) BACK UP YOUR SAVES FOLDER. The way the NO-VR mod works, you only have a limited number of saves (something like 3 autosaves and 3 quicksaves that are continually overwritten, and the NO-VR mod does NOT support saves that were made in the regular VR version of the game—you must use your own NO-VR saves with the mod). The game’s save folder is located within the main install HL: Alyx folder and is clearly labeled SAVES. Take the time to create a copy of that folder and keep multiple copies of it somewhere. Why? It is possible for you to get yourself into a non-reversible situation (again, see specific issues below) and all your saves have been overwritten and you have no way out, other than starting the game from scratch. You do you, but I choose the low-frustration route.

SPECIFIC ISSUES I FACED>

CONTROLLER PROBLEMS: I play my PC games with a controller (Xbox Series X/S via Bluetooth connected to Windows 11). You might not, and if you use KB+M, then you don’t need to read this. The NO-VR mod supports both KB+M players and players who use controllers, but two issues with my controller happened. First, MOST of the time, after the NO-VR mod booted, it would NOT recognize my controller as being connected even though I had the Steam community controller configuration loaded, applied to the game, and Steam input activated (which you have to do ahead of time). It was super frustrating. BUT I finally figured out what I had to do to fix the issue. I had to boot the game AND Steam in a specific order: 1) With NOTHING running (not Steam, not the mod) and making sure my controller was connected via bluetooth to Windows, I simply had to> 2) Double-click the NO-VR mod launcher.exe itself. 3) This starts the NO-VR mod launcher. (Steam is still NOT running.) 4) In the NO-VR launcher, click play. 5) This auto-starts Steam. 6) Then Steam auto-starts HL: Alyx. If I had anything running ahead of time (like Steam already running, or the NO-VR launcher already running), my controller would not be recognized. This is how I fixed it.

CRASHES: When I would die 3 or 4 times in a row (it happens as the Combine firefights get tougher towards the end) and the game would restart from a checkpoint, after the third or fourth checkpoint load, the NO-VR mod would crash to desktop. This is one of the reasons you should spam the quicksave so you don’t lose progress. But outside of this specific situation, I NEVER experienced a crash. It only happened after several quick restarts in a row.

STUCK: Due to the nature of the mod, it can happen that you end up stuck on a piece of geometry (usually because you are somewhere you shouldn’t be). Thankfully, the NO-VR mod has auto-enabled the “no clip” cheat to a specific key (V) so it is super-easy to unstick yourself if this happens.

FORWARD MOVEMENT STOPS: This one I had to grin and bear it. But Alyx would often simply stop walking forward when she encountered even the smallest object on the ground in some places. A small rock, a tiny cardboard box, a little cable on the ground—these are things she would normally glide right over, but instead she would come to a dead stop. There were some maps where I would have to hop my way through it if there was a lot of debris around. The problem seemed to come and go, but it was especially frustrating in a firefight when I was trying to beat a hasty retreat to reach some cover…and Alyx comes to a complete stop because there was a piece of paper on the ground--and then she’s full of Combine bullets.

GUN MODS: The game has Combine machines you can insert your gun into for upgrades. After the upgrade animation ends, the gun is supposed to pop back into your hand. In some chapters though, I found that my gun was still sitting in the upgrade machine after the animation stopped, and I could not retrieve it--all I could do was look at it. I certainly couldn’t go forward without a gun. So this is why I say: Spam that quicksave! Get in the habit of saving BEFORE you do anything major. Most of the time, I would just ignore that non-working upgrade machine and wait until I reached the next one.

SCRIPTED EVENTS DON’T TRIGGER: There were two cases where major scripted events would not trigger for me, and the game would not move forward. Again, this is a reason to back up your saves folder so you can revert. One was in the “Jeff” chapter where the monster you are stealthily avoiding is supposed to follow you into an elevator. No matter what I did, Jeff would NOT get into the elevator—he was stuck in an earlier part of the map banging on an invisible door. The second instance was where I deactivated a Combine force field, but it still wouldn't let me go through. In both cases, I used the built-in “no clip” cheat that the NO-VR mod has enabled, and the game moved forward, ignoring the glitched script. Yay.

Though the above list might sound like they are all reasons to NOT play the NO-VR mod, that is not the case at all. As with so many mods (and especially one of this magnitude), you have to be prepared for workarounds, restarts, backups…all that good stuff. I was so happy to be able to play this high-quality HL game. I got those old tickly HL vibes all over again after so many years. YAY!! Oh, and that ending!

I recommend starting with snap movement and snap look, and then if you are sitting for your play through like I was, change to continuous movement but keep the look setting on 'snap'. This worked well and I am someone who pukes from any kind of disorienting motion activity so if you are like me, the above works. 

As for the game itself, it's always enjoyable to see and experience valve games that iterate on  their previous game systems; they never seem to miss their mark. After playing this one, I agree that the quality of the base game, it being a true half life game that exceeds expectation, plus the virtual reality experience, are so one of a kind that they more than justify getting a whole new setup, but only to play this game. The vr market is dead and years later we still only have one complete game (this one) so if you are a HL fan, I'd say it's worth it.

First thing: Game is a triple AAA VR title and can't truly be appreciated in a non VR setting.

Second thing is and if you were never in such a situation you won't know what this game gets right. It has tons of options to combat VR motion sickness (us females are more prone to motion sickness in general).
And the accessibility options are really great, if you have any type of reduced mobility (even temporary in my case) you can 
still experience the game properly, can't bend over no problem, can't turn no problem, can't stand up or lay down no problem the game has you covered and you will still feel like being Alyx with a working body.
I can't talk about accessibility for colorblind or blind persons or one handed gameplay but Valve apparently worked on that part as well.
Also if you have an Index, a fully working body, a large play area and aren't prone to motions sickness especially in VR you are still able to use your hardware to the fullest and if you have neither of these Valve still has you covered so you can still enjoy the game to the fullest as it's just a bonus on top (nice to have but absolutely not necessary).

The third thing is great MOD support, yes you can play minigolf or visit Rapture from BioShock all via the click of a button from the Steam Workshop.
If you don't know how that works look up a YouTube video! (Hint: No other software is needed!)
All with the click of the button it's really just that easy and can be uninstalled the same way. The only hard part is finding what you want and if you want 30 things well just go ahead. You just need internet to download it (and a big enough hard drive if you're installing 500 mods on your almost full drive)
And in case a mod gets an update steam handles it like it handles updating other games and the neat part is only the changes are downloaded so if you have a bandwidth cap you shouldn't worry too much as it's usually only a few megabytes or even kilobytes.

And last but not least you get this game added to your account if you buy a (new) Valve Index at any point, alongside exclusive in-game weapon skins and an exclusive location in Steam VR.

Bonus: Jeff (I won't say more don't look it up and try to experience the game in VR.)

You play as Alyx, set five years before Half-Life 2 events happen. You explore the previously unknown area of City 17 known as The Quarantine Zone (QZ). You meet old and new enemies along the way.

I can highly recommend this game for people new to VR and to even veteran VR gamers.


Only negative sides are:
- You can't switch your weapon from hand to hand in combat,
- No sprint at all. Only ""jump"".
- In certain areas there are places where you need to crouch to get through obstacles, but instead of letting you crouch through the obstacle, it just teleports you through it.",1586109258,1706408613,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you have some heart disease where getting real scared is dangerous for you, do not play. This is the level of realism of this thing. There is nothing scarier than being in a a pitch black room, surround by fuel and hearing noises of headcrabs coming your way. Oh, and you only have a pistol to defend yourself and limited ammo.

The game itself is amazing. You don't have a fancy inventory where you collect an unimaginable amount of stuff. You do not press a key to reload your weapon. You have one backpack to carry ammo. If you want to reload, you need to actually move your hand over your head, as of reaching your backpack and make the grab movement with your hand. Then you need to open a slot in your weapon (and this is actually by pressing a button), then make the actual movement of slidding the ammo on the right place and then the movement of loading the bullet in the chamber (or shaking the weapon for it to shut closed). To take cover, similar principle applies. You need to physically craw behind a cover for it to be effective. To throw Xen granades, you need to actually squeeze the control to activate it. And if you have fear of heights, you will actually feel the same fear when being in a high place and looking down. Heck! During my first days polaying, I found myself missing the gravity glooves in real life.

However, I must say. Towards the end, it starts to get tiresome. You have just progressivelly harder enemies to shoot and story progress very slowly. I got a bit disapointed with the ending. But then, I did not played the other HL games. So I may have missed something. Overall, it is worth it.

And the story was a mix between Marvel-esque ""humor"" and ""quirky"" characters only to retcon the ending. They lost their best writers and it really shows. Disable the voices and the game gets much more tolerable. Its only saving grace is having pretty models and textures to look at, and having inspired the HL2 VR mods, which are far better because it's just Half Life 2. Alyx would be boring without the novelty of VR but a good game wouldn't need that crutch, and a good VR game would utilize VR such that it'd be unplayable without it.

As a long-time fan of the Half-Life series, I had high expectations for this installment, and I'm thrilled to say that it not only met but exceeded every one of them.

From the moment I stepped into the virtual shoes of Alyx Vance, I was captivated by the stunning graphics and attention to detail. The level of immersion achieved through VR is unparalleled, and Valve has truly raised the bar for what is possible in the medium. The environments are richly detailed, the character animations are lifelike, and the atmospheric sound design adds an extra layer of intensity to the experience.

The gameplay mechanics are nothing short of genius. The integration of VR technology allows for intuitive interactions with the environment, making every action feel natural and immersive. From solving intricate puzzles to engaging in intense firefights with Combine soldiers, every moment in Half-Life: Alyx is a testament to the thoughtful design and meticulous craftsmanship put into the game.

One of the standout features is the gripping narrative. Alyx Vance takes center stage in a story that seamlessly weaves into the larger Half-Life universe. The writing is sharp, the pacing is impeccable, and the characters are well-developed, providing a narrative that is both emotionally resonant and gripping from start to finish.

The sheer variety of gameplay elements keeps the experience fresh and exciting. Whether you're navigating through a darkened subway tunnel, solving complex puzzles, or battling otherworldly creatures, Half-Life: Alyx keeps you on the edge of your seat. The careful balance between exploration, puzzle-solving, and combat showcases the developers' commitment to delivering a well-rounded and engaging experience.

The attention to detail extends to the world-building as well. The City 17 of Half-Life: Alyx feels like a living, breathing environment with its own history and stories to tell. The meticulous world design adds depth to the overall experience and enhances the sense of immersion.

In conclusion, Half-Life: Alyx is a triumph of virtual reality gaming. Valve has managed to not only revive the beloved Half-Life franchise but also redefine the possibilities of VR as a storytelling and gaming platform. It's a must-play for fans of the series and anyone looking to be transported into a world where the line between reality and virtuality blurs into a seamless and unforgettable experience. Half-Life: Alyx is nothing short of a masterpiece, showcasing the potential of VR in ways that will resonate with gamers for years to come.",1706219879,1706219879,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Game play 1.7/2
The guns are a good mix of tactical and fun, but I wish there was a larger variety of guns. Also, the ammo system punishes conserving ammo. If you're unaware, ammo spawns based on whatever you're low on, so stockpiling shot gun shells won't get you many shells. I also would've liked some more enemy variety and more interesting puzzles, but the enemy AI is so good that you could replay a single combat encounter 30 times and get a unique result each time. Also the gravity gloves are a perfect solution to meshing first person shooter fights and virtual reality interactivity. 

Graphics 1.8/2
Everything about this game looks good and it runs pretty well on my PC, which is difficult to get for a VR game. I won't get into my specs right now though since I want to focus on the review. The graphics are not only highly detailed, but fit very well in the Half Life style of being beautiful when it wants to be and horrifying when it needs to be. They also achieved realistic looking faces that aren't uncanny, no matter how close you get up to Russel when he's trying to explain how to save Eli. My only small issue with the graphics is that the xen overgrowth all looks the sameish, but that's it.

Music 1/2
There's no memorable music in the game but the sound design fits the game well and it's not like there are any ear grating songs. Not as good as Half Life could be. 

Story 1.8/2
Pretty solid, and good prequel to Half Life 2. I don't feel like it expands upon the HL universe that much, it just develops existing characters. It also raises more contradictions than connections. However I was very excited about the ending and the reveal at the end only made me more pumped up for HL episode 3. 

Price 1/2
Average price for a VR game at $60. I played for about 20 hours, and I did two play throughs (had to get the gnome achievement.) Most VR players would be comfortable spending $60 on a game in the first place because their minimum requires PC costs at least $500 and another $200 for the headset, and another $20 for Virtual Desktop.",1706081794,1706081898,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As someone who Grew with Valve over the coarse of 20 years+ starting with Half life , then years of counter Strike and then half life 2 . I am loving this so much. Its must for anyone who played the half lifes in the past. you do not want to miss this.
ITs the best most well optimized VR game i have seen.
just incredible.
I didnt start this for many years because i was stuttering to much using Steam VR.
I had to low memory you see. i recently upgraded to 32 gigs DDR4 and now its great.
I would recommend anyone out there also have a good deal of memory and a pretty good GPU Card in order to play this smoothly.
and Oculous link works well for Solid connection and gameplay.

But in the year 2020 Half-Life Alyx was released. And I happened to ignore it.  As many players did. Because not a big percentage of players had a VR device then. And many still do. But it turned out to ignore it - was a big mistake. Alyx is a masterpiece of its own time as previous franchise games. I enjoyed myself playing it.

All those videos on YouTube and reviews can't give the feeling to you. And this is a big problem to sell a VR game. 'Cause it feels different on a flat screen. But VR is known to be highly immersive. You should use it yourself to get this experience. Everything in Alyx's world is extremely detailed. From the first seconds the scale of The Citadel impress you. It's epic and huge.

Definitely, HL Alyx is worth buying a VR headset for. 

P.s. Never play ""noVRmod"". You should use only VR device if you want to get a great experience, as I did. This game doesn't need such modification. You just need to enjoy it as is. Valve did an excellent job.

It's a visually great game, with well done mechanics, a good story and level design, with some nuanced aspects that make it the best VR game I own by far. However it is a buggy mess a lot of the time. Between loading levels it is as likely to crash as load it during some sections. Head tracking can be wonky.  

However we can't ignore that despite years of people asking for more Half -Life  and finally getting more ... it's VR only. I am lucky enough to own a VR headset and an ok sized play space to do this. But it is a huge -""GIVE US MORE MONEY BUY A €1000 VALVE INDEX SETUP"" - shaped middle finger to those fans who don't have that.

You get to explore the creepy Combine world, shoot those gross headcrabs, and even use the gravity gloves (kinda). Everything feels surprisingly real, even without the VR goggles. You grab things with your mouse, reload guns like a pro, and duck behind cover just in time.

And the story? Forget about it! You get to see Alyx grow up, fight for freedom, and maybe even shed a tear or two. It's all there, just like in the VR version, but without the sweaty face mask and tangled wires.

So if you're even a tiny bit curious about Half-Life: Alyx, don't let the VR thing hold you back. Grab the NoVR mod, fire up your PC, and get ready for an awesome adventure! Trust me, it's way better than watching someone else play it on YouTube.

I recently got into Half Life and played through the other games, this certainly lives up to the hype. Will write a full review once I've finished!

Edit:

This game is a masterpiece. From start to finish I had so much fun and even though hard mode was a bitch it was still fair and challenging. I loved the story and characters and how it tied everything from the previous entries together and even how it retconed the ending of Half-Life 2 Episode 2. Even though I only got into the series recently I still gushed so hard and got excited seeing G-Man and Gordon and all the ties to the previous games and getting to play as Alyx and I think that is a testament to how good this game and series is as a whole. This is 100% my new favourite game ever and Half-Life is my new favourite if not one of my new favourite series ever. I am not done with this game either. I see there is a workshop and there are mods and more ways to play and that is what makes me love this game even more. Having modders the Source 2 engine to craft us more games and write their own story into the Half-Life universe is amazing. I know this probably won't come out for a long time but I am looking forward to the sequel, whether it be Half-Life 3, Half-Life Alyx 2 or what not.

[b]Performance:[/b] Performance was largely good, but there were instances where I experienced stuttering. Occasionally when loading into a new area, my game would freeze and then I would get “Steam has encountered a critical error.”. These instances completely locked up my PC, but waiting a few minutes allowed SteamVR to close and I gained control of my PC again. Every time I loaded the game, it would tell me that my available video memory was low, but when I checked my resource monitor, it was only at about 30% usage. One section that noticeably affected my FPS was the [spoiler]section at the end with the Stryder.[/spoiler] As is always the case with VR titles, I’m not really going to take marks off for this kind of thing; there are just too many variables at play to say “The game is at fault for this performance.”. You sort of come to expect this kind of thing with VR titles.

[b]Graphics:[/b] What a detailed and interesting world this is! All the Combine tech stuff looks really cool. Seeing the zombies and headcrabs up close is gross and awesome. The big set pieces are massive  ‘wow’ moments. All the infested areas are so cool in that gross, alien way. They really did a great job of bringing the Half-Life world to life.

[b]Story:[/b] The story was almost in the background a lot of the way through, but not in a bad way. It does a good job at telling you what you’re trying to do or where you’re trying to go, but once you get that bit of information, it largely lets you do whatever you like in between, which I feel was the right choice for this title. It may not have been very complex; [spoiler] break Dad out of prison, then break “Gordon” out of prison[/spoiler], but it didn’t need to be, either. It just worked. I will say the end was the best part, story wise, and leaves me anticipating the next Half-Life VR game. P.S. Russel is hilarious.

[b]Gameplay:[/b] 

- Interaction: You can interact with a lot of items in the world which is nice. Shaking containers often plays a sound to hint at what might be inside; a nice touch I’ve never encountered in a VR game before. Writing on windows with markers, the way glass windows smash depending on how much force you use…these little touches go a long way in making this game feel really immersive. The Gravity Gloves were also really fun to use and so quick to learn. There were plenty of environmental hazards to exploit/avoid. The multi-tool puzzles for opening Combine machines/storage were fun and challenging.

- Weapons: You start out with a pistol that you can then upgrade in Combine fabricators with resin, which you find scattered around the world. Using the guns is great. The aim is bang on. All the other weapons you unlock as you go feel meaningfully different and the upgrades you can make along the way give that feeling of satisfaction over time.

- Enemies: Combat against the various regular enemies was enjoyable and the special enemies were designed very well. They introduced them in an informative manner and made sure you knew what to do, while remaining challenging.

[b]Misc notes:[/b] 

- You can wear a hardhats, buckets and traffic cones on your head.  The latter obscures the top 50% of your vision, but I got a huge laugh out of that and now every time I see one I have to put one on and enter a fit of laughter imagining what the Combine must think as I come sprinting at them with 2 grenades in my hands. 

- I didn’t like that we had to kill the poor little grubs for health! 

- The last level gets the “F#@k YES” award. That was one of the most enjoyable VR moments ever.

[b]Bugs:[/b] Once I had to reload a save and all the textures hadn’t loaded properly, so the world was devoid of detail. I just reloaded again, which fixed it.

[b]Final thoughts:[/b] Half-Life Alyx is one of the best VR titles, regardless of the performance issues. The quality of the game is immediately noticeable, the graphics and design are all top-notch and most importantly, it’s a heck of a lot of fun. 

[b]Do I recommend this game?[/b] Yes. At over $1 per hour of enjoyment (based on sale price, not retail price), this is one of the more expensive titles I’ve bought (I’m a cheapskate), but it’s honestly worth it at the price I paid.",1705634055,1705634180,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h3]+[/h3] The events of Half-Life: Alyx unfold before the events of Half-Life 2. From the very first minutes of the game it's clear that it's the same old, good and painfully familiar Half-Life. It was unreal pleasant to see the next game in the franchise after such a huge period of silence. And even though it's not Half-Life 3 or even Half-Life 2: Episode Three, it's still a great game with a great story and even cooler gameplay. The physics and the almost limitless possibilities of interacting with objects from the world around you are fantastic. HL has always been known for its interesting physics, but here it's even more elaborated. You can interact with almost any thing that comes into your field of vision with your glove. Want to draw a dlск on a window with a felt-tip pen? No problem at all.

[h3]~[/h3] I won't spoiler, but the end of the game hints at the continuation of the franchise, and I hope it will finally be part 3. Because we deserve it. And what we didn't deserve for sure is the silence about Half-Life 3. For me personally, this franchise has become one of my favorite games in the world. Valve managed to create an amazing, memorable story, lively characters and it's a shame that they left us without HL2: Episode 3... It would have looked even more epic in snowy locations. 
Let's go back to the game itself and discuss the minuses, because there are enough pluses here and it is close to the ideal, but nothing is perfect in this world.

[h3]-[/h3] The developers' decision to release the project completely under VR became doubtful. No doubt it's cool and it's the best game in virtual reality, but it would be possible to release a normal version. Because to buy a VR helmet for the just one game is not reasonable. Fortunately there is a solution to this problem. 
Special thanks to the developers of the [url=https://www.moddb.com/mods/half-life-alyx-novr] NoVR mod[/url]!
I think the name and so clear what its essence. Without this mod I would not have played this masterpiece, would not have touched the gorgeous story in a universe that I love very much. They have done a great job, giving us the opportunity to go through the game from the beginning to the end credits full-fledged and almost bug-free. And it all looks as high quality as if it were the original. It is unlikely that you are reading this, but if for some reason yes, then know that you are just the most real beauties! By the way, this mod is regularly updated, finalized and fixed, it's just super cool.

To sum it up: now in my list of favorite games there is also a game about Alyx. It's awesome and may more and more players live this wonderful experience. Such decent games are few and far between nowadays, modern developers are very often shoddy, releasing low-quality and uninteresting games. Or just do not try and release some trash indie projects, which flooded Steam. And among all this junk you can rarely find a hidden gem, and Half-Life: Alyx is just that.

Gaben, respect! But it was a mistake to remove CS:GO and replace it with the ugly CS 2, although I don't care because I've long preferred quality story-driven single-player games to online life-burners.

A lot of times when I open the weapon selection wheel the game will stutter and that causes pretty much all textures to switch to the lowest resolution possible with no consistent way of fixing it, also sometimes the game just crashes and makes my entire computer completely unresponsive as a result, and when it doesn't have such a dramatical crash it will almost always refuse to launch again and instead it will prompt me to resttart steamvr except that does not work and I have to reboot my PC every time it crashes which it does a lot.

If VR were more widely accessible, this type of thing would probably be a serious branch in the future of interactive entertainment. As for the moment, still a more niche outlet, but one with considerable potential as far as the power to create engaging experiences goes.

The scale of everything feels bigger, more intimate in a way that is unique to VR. Headcrab zombies aren't just a standard enemy, its a grown man with a parasite the size of a cooked turkey where his head ought to be. VR provides a perspective on that which impacted me in a way that was new. Similar to being at a theme park, that's the feeling I got. Like that weird sort of ""I feel like I'm inside a world that isn't real"" when you see the beautifully constructed sets surrounding you in the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" ride. Riding the line of the literally present but fake landscape. 

Immersive in a unique way, but out of reach for any consumer not entirely bent on obtaining it. If you get the chance, this is really really cool though. I borrowed my friend's headset after I bought this on sale. I'm a pretty big Half-Life fan and I had to get around to this one sooner or later.

The gameplay itself is another shining entry in Valve's catalog. So good it feels almost like it was always meant to work that way.  Shotgun threw me for a loop sometimes though.

great Level Design - every level feels new, good pacing between supplying, riddles and combat
stunning grafics - the level of details e.g. of the gloves is just mindblowing. 

there are 3 things that I can think of could be improved: 
1 - some objects don`t have collisionsound. meaning: if I throw a Billiard Ball it will have no sound hitting the floor. 
2 - throwing that stuff does no real damage to enemies

I've seen clips of game-play online, seen or heard of the editing of Half Life 1, 2 and Episode 2, but never played a valve-created game besides Team Fortress 2 and Left 4 Dead 2. So upon getting my VR headset this Christmas, and seeing I had enough to buy Half-Life Alyx on sale (roughly $30 CAD), I bought it after hearing its reception of being the best that 3D had to offer. I've also played on the highest difficulty provided and now attempting my second play through where I try to complete all my missing achievements.

After completing it today, I am both amazed and sadden that Valve have seemingly stepped away from creating video games.

Game play wise: The intro did a fantastic job of getting me accustom to the world and the gameplay expected from me. Gun-fights were intense, and whenever I would die, I never felt like the game cheated me. Instead, I would always go ""Hm, I could've done this better"" or ""What if I went this way instead."" This game fuels creativity from its players, and rewards curious minds who look at ever small nook and cranny for ammo and upgrade cells. Despite the small pool of enemy types, I do believe it was smart in the long-run, as it ensured players would be familiar with each type and create a mental profile on how to action around one, or take note of weapon's weak points to not waste ammo.

Puzzles wise: I feel like this part get a lot of slack from other players, but I never minded doing them. To me, they were a fun reprieved after a  high-octane encounter with enemies. It also helped that doing them never felt useless, as it is always tied to upgrade stations, or additional ammo or health syringes. Even the tripwire puzzles were fun, and added to the intensity of not setting it off mere inches from it.

Thematic Wise: Half Life Alyx gave me a story that made me want to learn more about the Half-Life Universe, and also scared the pissed out of me with its horror elements. It's funny how the tone of this game can make you go from a one-man army bad-ass, taking out groups upon groups of Combine, and also make me paranoid and fanatic whenever fighting head-crabs or traversing pitch-black spaces. I've never been this immerse in a game before, and with the current market of VR titles or flat-screen titles, I don't think there will be another till a very long time.

It's hard to think of flaws that this game have that is entirely its own fault. I could say that being strictly for VR is a downgrade, but I also know that the game's whole identity and appeal will be muddled transitioning to flat-screen game-play. It can work, but it was never built for key and mouse. Although it baffles me how this game have yet to get official DLC besides fan-made content. This game-play style has so much potential, and I would happily play more. But if I have one main criticism for the game, is its price range.

Half-Life is an incredible game, but it cost $78 CAD (Plus Tax) to play normally which I feel is too much. Sure it comes free with Valve's VR headset, but that's over 1000+ and VR is too niche of a medium to pay full price for a game that, while high quality, isn't the type of game you'll continuously play for the rest of your life. Steam already makes Valve billions, so only buy this game when it is on sale, it'll be more favourable and not send your wallet into debt within the VR gaming sphere.

Overall: Half-Life: Alyx showed me why Valve titles get the hype they so rightfully deserves. This title alone has gotten me interested in exploring Valve's older back catalog, and anticipating the latest entry into the series, while will probably not continue the story until another 20 years. This is a MUST-BUY for VR owners, but ONLY when the price is reasonable enough. All I hope is that when VR games move forward, they look at this title for inspirations and build off its foundation. If Valve knows one thing, it's building a strong foundation for others to build off it.",1705019085,1705181181,True,2,0,0.541984736919403076,0,True,False,False

The first 5 minutes of the opening had me hooked as what I saw in front of me took me back to when I was younger playing Half Life 2 for the first time. 

Everything from the gunplay, the physics, the aesthetic, the visuals, to the voice acting, the story and set pieces are truly phenomenal. Being able to see the surrounding atmosphere of City 17 in a scale not possible when half life two was released only brings this world more to life and gives you a better idea of how much humanity truly has against it when you see the Combine. 

This is a great benchmark to what I hope is a return to the universe of Half Life and there is a lot more to come. *Fingers crossed*

The primary culprit is the relentless presence of Headcrab Zombies as the main adversaries. Unfortunately, their ubiquity has become a source of weariness for me. It feels like every few minutes, I'm confronted with the predictable scenario of a door opening, only to reveal another Headcrab Zombie emerging.

In the expansive Half-Life universe, renowned for its diverse range of formidable foes, it's disheartening to see the gameplay overly focused on dispatching variations of Headcrabs. The repetitiveness of encountering these creatures has dulled the excitement that initially drew me to the game.

Nonetheless, despite this critique, I acknowledge the game's overall brilliance and my enduring love for the Half-Life series. The narrative depth, engaging mechanics, and captivating world-building remain commendable. My only wish is for the franchise to swiftly unveil a new instalment, perhaps delving into unexplored aspects of the narrative.

Yes.

The game design – the puzzles, gameplay and enemy encounters – are pure genius. 

This is in direct contrast to possibly the worst writing I’ve ever had to endure, in any format. Execrable is too mild an adjective. Googling it, I see the writing changed hands a few times, but apparently the original Half Life writers were eventually summoned back with success.

What happened?

Is this their artistic suicide note? 

Wait until you see the deus ex machina ending, which completely erases all the good work of their former selves – if it’s even the old Half Life writers to begin with. 

I personally don’t believe it.   

This was written to clearly appeal to a non-existent ‘moron’ target audience, who’s even a level below your average Marvel junkie, the She-hulk era. 

The voice actors sounded like they couldn’t take any of it seriously. It’s complete thrash. As in, it’s written in the most cynical ‘quippy’ way you could possibly think of – braindead crassness.

This is in direct contrast to the visual narrative – the story told by what you see – which is pretty much VR Mozart: beautiful and harrowing and thought-provoking and mysterious. 

And ‘epic’, of course. The last ‘boss’ fight against a strider is simply glorious, unprecedented adrenaline fuel. 

The various spatial awareness mini-games that only work in VR are the most innovative video game puzzles ever created IMO. Fantastic.

The environmental puzzles range from brilliant to about 2-3 overly obscure additions, such as an obnoxiously subtle support bar you’ll have to raise to get to the next point in the level. It’s not even a spoiler, because you will 100% miss this without a game guide.

Otherwise, these are again the best environmental puzzles (IMO) ever designed. 

The enemies, while brilliantly designed, are too few in variety to sustain the length of the game. Zombies, in particular, are overused. But overall, this is once more the most thrilling ‘pure combat’ video game experience you’ll ever encounter, by a million miles. 

To close off, it’s truly a VR masterpiece – and the pinnacle of what humans can create as a ‘gameplay’ experience. No ‘flat screen’ alternative can hold a candle to what has been achieved here. The gameplay innovation, making exemplary use of VR novelties, is the human imagination at peak inventiveness – absolutely awe-inspiring.

The narrative, meanwhile, seems to be written to appeal to I-don’t-know-who – cynically, an audience of gauche geeks, or something? 
Certainly the creepy ‘I’ll show you my gun when this is all over’ banter between Alyx and whatever-his-name-is is laced with all kinds of cack-handed ‘dirty’ innuendo. 

Lame and moronic – if Valve are to do a HL3, hopefully they sack these idiots and hire someone from CD Projeckt Red to save them.",1705104206,1705104206,True,0,0,0.458015263080596924,0,True,False,False

In the vast landscape of virtual reality, Half-Life: Alyx doesn't just set the bar; it launches it into the stratosphere, marking a watershed moment for VR gaming. Valve's return to the Half-Life universe is nothing short of a magnum opus, seamlessly blending gripping storytelling, breathtaking visuals, and revolutionary VR gameplay.

Immersive Narrative:
Set between the events of Half-Life and Half-Life 2, Alyx Vance's journey against the relentless Combine offers a gripping narrative that expands the Half-Life lore. As humanity's last hope, players navigate a world under siege, where every discovery and scientific endeavor becomes a beacon of resistance against the alien invaders.

Groundbreaking VR Integration:
Valve's commitment to virtual reality is evident in every frame of Alyx. The game is not a VR adaptation; it's a VR masterpiece. From the ground up, the gameplay is designed to leverage the immersive capabilities of VR, offering players deep environmental interactions, intricate puzzle solving, expansive world exploration, and visceral combat that can only be experienced in virtual reality.

Environmental Interaction and Puzzle Solving:
Alyx Vance's world is yours to explore and interact with in unprecedented ways. Lean around corners for that perfect shot, rummage through shelves for essential supplies, manipulate tools to hack alien interfaces - every action is an invitation to be part of the game's living, breathing environment.

Visceral Combat:
The combat in Alyx is nothing short of a revelation. VR's tactile nature translates into an unparalleled sense of presence on the battlefield. Toss a bottle to distract an enemy, rip a Headcrab off your face and hurl it out a window - each encounter is a dynamic, heart-pounding dance with danger.

Revolutionary VR Mechanics:
Alyx redefines what's possible in virtual reality. Its innovative mechanics, from aiming around obstacles to interacting with the world using intuitive gestures, showcase the limitless potential of VR when harnessed by a visionary development team.

A Benchmark for VR Gaming:
Half-Life: Alyx isn't just a game; it's a manifesto. It sets a new standard for what VR games can achieve, raising the bar for storytelling, gameplay, and immersion. As Valve's magnum opus in the VR realm, Alyx cements its place as a cornerstone in the evolution of virtual reality gaming.

In the realm of virtual reality, Half-Life: Alyx isn't just a game changer; it's the game that changes everything. If you've ever doubted the transformative power of VR, Alyx is here to shatter those doubts and immerse you in an experience that transcends the boundaries of gaming as we knew it.",1705021126,1705021126,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Luckily, over the festive period I received a Quest 3, and with my immediate delight I knew exactly what game I needed to try first.

I’ve been able to play through the game twice now, the latter whilst holding on to the iconic Gnome Chompski (my final achievement [i]Gnome Vault of My Own[/i]). 

As an immersive experience, I’m absolutely blown away by the numerous moments of wonder, excitement, goosebumps & jump scares scattered throughout the campaign. The world feels so alive. I’ve had literal moments where I’ve stood and stared, with an open mouth, in complete disbelief. These moments range from large-scale events: viewing the Citadel & City 17 for the first time in VR, to moments of small-scale interaction: releasing a used ammo clip for your gun and replacing it with a fresh clip kept in your rucksack, or grabbing a health injector with your gravity gloves, mid-fight, then injecting it into your opposing wrist. All the while, time is of the absolute essence and the enemy stops for no-one. 

As a story venture it’s been a blast. I’ve been captured & rescued in City 17, escaped underground and forged alliances with vortigaunts. I’ve fought the Combine masses, dodged Antlion waves and survived harrowing [i]near-jeff[/i] experiences. I’ve crossed all that this world has to offer and ended up at the helm of the combine supersecret. It’s been an enthralling experience from the get-go. 

As a fan, I run out of superlatives to describe what the series has meant to me. Half-Life: Alyx has continued my most cherished series growing up. As a kid I witnessed Half-Life, Blue Shift and Opposing Force. As a teenager, I witnessed Half-Life 2, with Episode One and Episode Two. As an adult, I witnessed the release of Half-Life: Alyx. No matter what queue of games I have at any given time, the [i]Half-Life[/i] series routinely falls back into the list. I’ve been doing this for the last 20 years on Steam. 

An unreal experience worthy of everybody’s time.

I played it on an Oculus Quest 2 using a link cable and it's been one of the most incredible gaming experiences I've ever had, if not THE greatest gaming experience I've ever had.
Equal parts horrific and beautiful, the work that has gone into the development of this game is just staggering. Every set piece and location is uniquely real, with purpose and level design in every square inch.
There are places in the game, so nightmarish, that you have to will yourself forward to progress. And vistas so startlingly gorgeous that you will stop in your tracks just to marvel at what is in front of you.
Aside from the insanely well-made environments, the game play is polished to a very high shine.
Plucking a grenade out of the air, tossing it back at the combine soldiers with one hand while simultaneously squeezing off a single round to rupture the valve on a gas tank on the back of a grunt.
Watch the grunt flail around hopelessly while he and the other two explode, then reload and prime your pistol for the next round. I have never felt like such a bad-ass in a game before.
The simple act of reloading your weapons, which would be a single button press in any other game, feels REAL, feels like something important.
The enemy AI is sneaky, forcing you to make full use of your environment: cover, explosives, choke points, kill boxes. Everything comes into play instinctively.
I won't say anything about the story, other than it's way more than I ever expected. 25 hours, just wow.
If this game had been released at a time when VR was fully commercially available to everyone, this would have won every award.
TLDR: If you're thinking of getting VR one day, and you played some of the Half-Life games, or just like games in general: Don't think, just get this. As of 2023, this is the best PC gaming experience you are going to have until the next one comes out.
I'm trying to think of negatives for this game, for balance, but all I can think of is that they could have handled the big reveal a bit better, but it's a minor consideration considering that this game is a complete masterpiece.",1704718422,1704718422,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's an exceptional game. If you've been on the fence about getting a VR headset, this is the killer app that makes it worth it.

You can tell it's a Valve game, because despite the jank that comes along with VR, it is exceptionally well polished. Aiming is much harder, so enemies are in small groups and always accompanied by cover. You can get sights (and laser sights) for your guns, which helps quite a bit. Enemy AI is reworked to compliment your teleportation-like movement (which you can change, though I don't recommend this), and the gloves...

Oh my god the gloves. I assume if you've read this far, you're okay with the most minor of spoilers. This game features gloves. Gravity gloves. You can, of course, pick stuff up like you'd expect. But you can also aim your open hand at an object, press a button, and then flick your wrist back to send it flying towards you.

I had high expectations, given the franchise, Valve's reputation, and the reputation of the game in VR spaces. Without a doubt it looks great and you can tell a ton of work was put into creating the world and the environments. But as a game... it's pretty bad. I'm not going to claim to be the world's greatest gamer, VR or otherwise, but I'd characterize this as ""borderline unplayable"".  The physics puzzles are fine, the VR interaction is pretty solid, but they leaned too hard into ""VR makes people sick"" which means you can't run-and-gun and every combat interaction involves standing in one spot and magdumping into bullet sponge zombies. Miss too many shots and you get to die and restart the area. I have more deaths/minute of any game in recent memory because I'm constantly out of ammo and you move so slowly you can't realistically outrun enemies, or areas are locked until enemies are defeated/locks are shot.  I think it's poor game design that a poor-average player is expected to constantly restart the game if they're not hitting >80% of shots. Even if I had infinite ammo and infinite health, just standing there magdumping into a slow walking zombie isn't very fun. On top of that, you're constantly playing ""where's ammo"" looking around every nook and cranny in each area because you'll need that one mag that's hiding under a bucket if you don't want to die and restart.

Maybe it gets better, but I've looked at guides online and can't discern anything I'm doing wrong. I've played through a ton of standalone VR games and this falls so short of all of them, which blows my mind. Maybe this game just isn't for me.

weapons: the amount of weapons lack, i dont like how there are no melee weapons or any close range combat.
but the guns are still incredibly fun to use.
Physics: Physics are amazing. glass shatters into millions of pieces and when you smash the glass it smashes the glass in a different way, its so cool. and did i mention that everything EVERYTHING is interactable? how cool is that! you can literally put a cone on a combine (if they dont already murder you) and run away! it is so fun. 
Mods: the amount of mods is good, but not amazing. easy to install the mods, easy to use, easy to enable, and the mods are pretty fun as well, like gordons crowbar. not much to say about the mods apart from Decent.
Storage Space amount: you need about 64 gigs to install this game, so a little much but still okay.
Price: price is a little expensive compared to the other half life games, but still worth every penny. 
NPCS: the ai in this game is amazing, but a little buggy sometimes with russel. but other than that they are great.
Cons: no melee weapons, a little bit of filler in the middle of the game, but it wont feel like a game with any shorter time. npcs are a little buggy at some points.

All I can say is - oh my God,

Having purchased a Pico Neo 3 (8k) off Alixpress for £180 and spending half a day configuring it to work with SteamVR, I realised I needed to use ""Streaming Assistant"" from Pico- for anyone else considering a cheap VR headset- totally recommend this -very very crips images, no lag.

This is incredible- the game starts off with the familiar and reassuring deep guitar twang and dark themed Valve head, then drops you into seeing the world as Alyx, they have accurately modeled the world in 3D, from looking down at your hands with thumb and fingers moving just like mine in real life (but detected on the controllers). 
I will clearly need to play standing up -having configured my VR ""safe"" area in my seat and about 50CM around my body, I have ended up the first part of the game in a seated position in the world, and must be literally crawling/walking ducked down, judging by looking just at rail level out of Alyx's flat, and upon being greeted by various people who are looking over my head- if I stand (in the real world) all is well but I will have to get a longer USB cable for my VR headset.
So far I have just been walking around the apartment to the basement to meeting  the guy who gives you the telekentic gloves, but to be honest, spending over an hour simply marvelling at the implementation of VR into a game and I'm still not bored having barely travelled 100m in the game, picking objects up, throwing them to them smashing and generally interacting in the world.
The sound location works very well with the VR- knowing of something is left right front or back. Looking up at the birds flying around/ general bugs -opening car doors and bugs flying in / out. Everything has a feeling of being real / alive in the virtual world and it exists, irrespective of you.

Well worth getting VR just for this game- I am glad I did. And I've barely started. 
Having been a long term Valve fan and playing all the original Half life1, 2, episodes and Black Mesa, this game does not disappoint. Very well polished and put together. I can't wait to explore further.

Having been a fan of the whole Half Life series ever since the first original game, I was really looking forward to finally sitting down and playing Alyx but, for me, it was not an option as VR gives me very bad motion sickness. It was an instalment of the Half Life series that would remain forever out of reach for me. However, I didn't count on the ingenuity of the HL modding community and, in this case, the GB_2 Development Team behind the amazing Half Life Alyx No VR mod. Thanks to them, I was finally able to play the game and, perhaps not the way you guys at Valve intended, really enjoyed the experience.

So, I have a request to make to Valve themselves. Would you, could you, kindly consider helping the GB_2 Development Team to polish and perhaps fully integrate their wonderful mod into the game itself as an option for players like me who cannot do VR for medical reasons?

In closing I just wanted to say a big thanks to Valve for creating another great instalment of Half Life and also the GB_2 Development Team who allowed me to actually play it.",1704574836,1704574836,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

HL Alyx is good. The campaign is 15-ish hours long. This game is not worth the normal price that is like 70e. I got the game when it was at 20e, and thats definitely worth it. The campaign is good, with good, simple puzzels and physics. The combat in this game is basic but still fun. You hide behind cover and then shoot. You also walk really slow wich makes this a slow-paced game. You can teleport, which you will be most likely using to hide behind cover faster. HL Alyx has phenomenal graphics, these graphics are the best to this date (in my opinion).

Now to the longer explenation

Campaing/Gameplay
I completed the game with around 16 hours. Its a good campaign. Each level is different and plays out different (going off of memory). There arent really any specific levels i didint enjoy. Maybe the later levels because my game was lagging, due to my PC specs. To put it simply, a normal valve campaign, but. Even when the game shows of new things like new enemy types, controls, physics, puzzels and all that. It all is nothing new. Its things we've seen before. No new physics or mechanics. What i mean by that is that those arent really any revolutionary things. Maybe two things i really think are cool about the game that i havent seen any other VR game do is that Alyx's hands react to what you are touching, not holding and when you pick up something Alyx will pick it up depending on your hands angle. Let me talk about the first thing, if you for an example put your hand on a slope. Youll see that her fingers react and follow the pattern/slope. And the second thing is that when you pick up an object like a bucket Alyx's fingers will correspond how you picked up the bucket. Its hard to explain, best shown visually. But those are  just visual things. They dont change the gameplay. As for the gameplay youll be mostly listening to the dialog, picking up ammo and resin, and just overall exploring your surroundings. Each levels is very well made with its interactivity. Which gives this game feel alive. There are so many things to touch and interact with. Youll probably find yourself pick up something and play with it like throwing it. 

Combat
The combat is lacking but also fun at the same time. What i mean by that is that yes it is fun shooting at enemies. But i just wish it there was more to do in combat. In HL Alyx you use the pistol for long shots, SMG to spray-and-pray/tougher enemies, shotgun for close-range and grenades for elimating enemies that are too close to one another. In my opinion that is not a whole lot of variety. While you do stuff like duck behind cover, youll just be waiting for the enemies to be done shooting. + ducking in any VR shooter is pretty much a basic thing. What im trying to say is that the combat is just hide behind cover and shoot. It is fun but i wish there was more to it. Like more weapons or gadgets like in Boneworks. In Boneworks you can use melee weapons or almost any objects that you can see to kill enemies. You can also box enemies or smash them against a wall to kill them. Also you can only walk and teleport. Which makes this very slow-paced. Which is fine with me. But as mentioned previously. There is really no variety in how you wanna approach a fight. Which is what made the Half life series so good. Ive played Half life, HL opposing force and half life 2 (but in VR). And each game gave you a set of guns. Each gun was like a tool. And you use different tools for different kinds of problems. But not in this game. It is very apparent that in this game the combat was not a primary thing. There is a mod that adds running to this game but it just ruins the flow, also the fact that teleporting is faster.

Graphics
The graphics are the BEST i have EVER SEEN. My PC couldnt handle the later levels soo i had to lower the graphics down to low in the settings. And yet it looked phenomenal. Truly the greatest looking VR game to  date. It also runs pretty smooth. I also had to turn of any background things like spotify, operaGX, steam and soo on, soo that my game wouldnt lag (My PC is a mid-spec or whatever you call it). Overall the graphics were REALLY GOOD. Even when i lowered them the the lowest setting i could it ran pretty smooth. Only the later levels were laggy.

Mods that i recommend:
""Flashlight Toggle Button""
""Unpin Ragdolls [ALL MAPS UPDATED]""
""Dismemberment"" - if you like gore
""Burtal Blood"" - if you like gore

I edited this review after playing about another 20 hours and i have only pretty much changed only one statement in this review. Which is the combat. Before this i wrote that it was slow, boring and nothing new. But now i like it. But still wish there was more to it than what we got. Still recommend this if you want a game that looks pretty, has a basic combat system and made by a very successful and popular company.",1695898646,1704572865,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have a small room and barely enough space to swing my arms around, and an inability to do a complete turn with my body without hitting stuff. I almost never had any problems playing the game like this. Both teleport-style movement and continuous movement controls are precise and easy to use, allowing me to position exactly where I wanted. 

If you have a mobility impairment, be aware there is one point late in the game where I had to physically lie on the floor of my play space and physically crawl forward approximately 2 metres. I couldn't find a way to proceed without doing so, but I may have failed to notice an alternative traversal path, and there are also many accessibility options available that I didn't enable, so they may provide a way to bypass it. Furthermore, there are some areas of the game where it is not required but is very helpful to get lower in your play space to hunker down behind low cover to avoid gunfire. Some objects which you are required to interact with to proceed require you to touch both of your hands to the floor of your play space. Again, there may be accessibility options for this that I am unaware of. The vast majority of the game should be comfortable to play seated as long as you have plenty of room to swing your arms around, and you'd probably get the best experience in a swivel chair.
For the hearing impaired, subtitles are available throughout.

[h3]How scary is this game? Is it appropriate for children?[/h3]
This game requires you to go through many prolonged sections that are designed to be frightening, such as pitch black rooms containing monsters and disturbing imagery such as decaying human corpses that you are required to touch and move close to. Regarding jumpscares, your mileage may vary: I never experienced any scripted jumpscares throughout the game, but the dynamic behaviours of some fast-moving monstrous enemies may cause them to surprise you under frightening circumstances. Some enemies you find in pitch black areas attempt to jump towards your face. One mandatory section of the game includes a large visually-disturbing monster which cannot be killed and stalks you through claustrophobic but well-lit rooms. Although these experiences and visuals may be considerably frightening to some players, the game maintains a whimsical and upbeat narrative tone throughout, which can help to defuse some of the tension. This game does contain frequent gory imagery, but only in the form of human remains of people who died long before you arrive. This includes rotting corpses, dead bodies missing eyeballs, and viscera regurgitated by monsters who had previously eaten people.

[h3]This game is very robust and well optimized[/h3]
I have played through the whole game and I never encountered any significant bugs or any performance problems in any area of the game. You can choose from 4 graphics presets (low/medium/high/ultra) and then the game dynamically scales a variety of graphics settings behind the scenes to try and maintain at least 90hz framerate: for example shadow draw distance, texture fidelity and render resolution. They do clever things to hide the transitions when they do this dynamic scaling, so it was only very occasionally that I noticed a shadow pop-in or out. 
I played with an AMD 5700XT graphics card and an AMD 2700 CPU, using a Meta Quest 2 headset connected by a link cable. With this I played on High preset and the framerate was so good throughout the whole game that I never experienced any perceptible motion stuttering or peripheral pop-in. 
How good it looks in the trailers is how good it looked for me through the whole game.
There's a free VR performance test tool you can get in the steam store. The performance you get there is a good representation of the performance you'll get playing this game on the Medium graphics preset.

The physics are very robust, and it's very satisfying and intuitive to touch and handle physics affected objects throughout the game. The game also goes to great lengths to reward creative lateral thinking by the player in how you touch and hold objects in your environment to help you overcome problems.

I have been a HL fan since I was a child playing it on my grandmother's IBM. I cannot tell you how many times I've blown through them all. I never thought I'd get a chance to experience Alyx in its full form and figured I'd have to settle for the non-VR mod. Boy, am I glad I didn't.

Not only is this the quintessential VR experience, it's simply the most fun I've ever had in a game. HL + VR? It's a no-brainer. The level of immersion that is present here is insane. The way the game plays is unparalleled. The visuals are next-level. Firefights in this game are incredible, as you can physically duck down behind desks, or walls, then peek out and take shots at the Combine or ever-malicious Headcrabs/Zombies, toss a grenade, etc.. I can't get enough of it,

The physics are so much fun to mess around with, too. You can legitimately rummage through junk to find supplies in this game. It's easy and simple to pull off, but so satisfying in the process. Haptics are on point and the controls are perfect. This is it for VR right now. There is no other VR gaming experience like this currently, and if you have the hardware to pull it off, you're only doing yourself a disservice by not playing it.

This VR masterpiece isn't just a game; it's a transcendent experience that redefines what's possible in the realm of virtual reality.

From the moment you don the headset, you are thrust into the decaying, dystopian world of City 17, a setting so immersive that you can almost feel the grit under your fingers. The attention to detail is staggering, with every nook and cranny exuding the kind of realism that blurs the line between fiction and reality. Valve has not just raised the bar; they've redefined it.

The narrative is a brilliant continuation of the Half-Life saga, seamlessly weaving the story between the events of Half-Life 1 and 2. As Alyx Vance, you're not just a spectator; you're an active participant in a gripping tale of survival, intrigue, and the relentless pursuit of answers. The pacing is impeccable, with moments of heart-pounding intensity and quiet, contemplative exploration that showcase the versatility of the VR medium.

The star of the show, however, is the gameplay. Valve has harnessed the power of VR to deliver an unparalleled level of interactivity. From physically manipulating objects to solving puzzles that require both wit and dexterity, every action feels natural and intuitive. The gravity gloves, a stroke of genius, add a layer of immersion that has to be experienced to be fully appreciated. Combat is a visceral dance of strategy and reflexes, making you feel like a true survivor in the face of relentless Combine forces.

The audio design is another triumph, creating an atmospheric soundscape that heightens the tension and draws you deeper into the world. The eerie echoes of distant enemies, the haunting ambient noises, and the iconic sounds of the Combine machinery contribute to an audio experience that is as chilling as it is captivating.

Graphically, ""Half-Life: Alyx"" is a visual spectacle that showcases the true potential of VR. The attention to detail in the environments, the realistic character models, and the seamless transitions between different locations are a testament to Valve's commitment to pushing the boundaries of technology.

While the requirement for a VR setup might be a barrier for some, ""Half-Life: Alyx"" stands as a compelling reason to invest in the technology. It's not just a game; it's a landmark achievement that sets a new standard for what VR can and should be. Valve has not only revived a beloved franchise but has also charted a course for the future of immersive gaming.

In conclusion, ""Half-Life: Alyx"" is a triumph on every front. It's a testament to the potential of virtual reality, a love letter to fans of the Half-Life series, and a milestone in gaming history. Valve has not just delivered a game; they've crafted an experience that will be remembered as a defining moment in the evolution of interactive entertainment.

It was evidently made with first timers in mind, while I prefer the more open ended ""natural"" gameplays of other stories, this isn't that and that's okay.

  Fun to shoot in. Plenty of ammo management, tons of collectible currency and ammo to dig around for with worthwhile and tactile upgrades. The puzzles weren't so memorable to me or quite fun. But the rest of the game was plenty to make up for it. Immersive looting and shooting.

What's scarier to me than any survival horror game is the thought that I could have went my entire life without experiencing this masterpiece.

Almost 4 years after its release and there is still no VR game as polished as Alyx. Maybe there are other games in terms of the number of mechanics, but none of them has collisions and interactions with the environment so well done (maybe Bonelab would have a chance, but it's a small game).

Linear/corridor productions are not made today because of profitability, and fortunately, thanks to VR, Alyx is one. Old shooter experience in a new setting and technology.

People are waiting for Half Life 3. Valve said that each HL presents some technological breakthrough. Alyx is Half Life 3 (not in the strict sense of the story) and presents new technology.

All I can say is: bravo Valve. The best gaming experience in recent years with a marginal (very small) number of non-disruptive bugs (one ladder bug was a pain).

Played on Quest 3.

A must-have game. Even without discount.

Polski:
Prawie 4 lata po premierze i wciąż nie wyszła żadna gra VR tak dopracowana jak Alyx. Może pod względem ilości mechanik znajdą się inne gry, ale żadna nie ma tak dobrze zrobionej kolizji i interakcji z otoczeniem (może Bonelab miałby szanse ale to mała gra).

Dzisiaj nie tworzy się produkcji liniowych/korytarzowych ze względu na opłacalność produkcji, a dzięki VR Alyx na szczęście taki jest. Stare doświadczenie shooterów w nowej oprawie i technologi.

Ludzie czekają na Half Life 3. Valve powedział, że każdy HL prezentuje jakiś przełom technologiczny. Alyx to jest Half Life 3 (nie w rozumieniu stricte ciągu fabularnego) i prezentuje nową technologie.

Mogę tylko powiedzieć: brawo Valve. Najlepsze doświadczenie gamingowe ostatnich lat z marginalną (bardzo małą) ilością nieprzeszkadzających błędów (jeden bug z drabiną był upierdliwy).

It truly showcases what you could do with VR while also adding a decent story and gameplay elements. I saw my friend play this via VR. So if you have a VR headset, GET THIS GAME!!! You're in for a treat. 

Unlike my friend though, I don't have any wish to get a vr headset. I could afford it, but I just don't see myself really using it being that there are very limited amount of games to make it worthwhile to me. As much as I love Alyx, I wouldn't spend more than the game purchase to get it to play on a vr headset because then it would pick up dust. I've been playing the game with the no vr mod, and while it is somewhat buggy and it simplifies certain VR elements that would have been there, I am really enjoying the game. It's akin to a slower pace FPS with a half life story. Since I am a fan of the series, I am really in it for the story alone, and maybe in the future, if the VR gamespace changes, I may play it again with a VR headset. 

Props to Valve for creating an engaging story with funny dialog. I loved Alyx since she appeared in half life 2 and the subsequent episodes. I hope we get more with Gordon as well. But, I hope they don't make all their future games strictly for VR. I feel it would limit the audience that could enjoy the half life series. I was disappointed that Merle Dandridge wasn't voicing Alyx, but the new voice actress does a decent job. Also, she voiced Julianna from Deathloop and did a great job so don't mind it as much.

For a long time I was wondering if it was worth purchasing a VR headset just to play this game. 3 years to be exact. Finally this summer I decided it was time, and, also thanks to the dirt cheap Quest 2, I eased myself into the VR world.

A friend recommended playing something else first, in order not to spoil the “G.O.A.T.” right away, and so I did. I started with other games, trying to overcome the sickness meanwhile. Luckily I got used pretty fast and I can now play as much vr as I want without feeling any fatigue or sickness.

After a few months I felt the time had come, so I installed Alyx.

I had purposefully avoided watching anything about the game beforehand, in order to prevent spoilers, so I went in totally blind.

For starters I will say: this is not Half Life 3! Nor it wants to be. There is no crowbar and the main character (Alyx) is fully voiced, so it definitely isn't a mainline Half-Life game. Someone defined this game’s genre more like a survival horror than fps. The first Half-Life was scary too back in 1998 and it also set a new standard for its genre, and the same did Alyx in 2020, in my opinion.

That said, in the game we will control Alyx Vance, daughter of Eli Vance, 5 years before the events of Half-Life 2. Eli gets arrested and abducted by the combine and we will have to track him down and rescue him. This will bring us on a journey through the city 17 quarantine zone. All the levels are quite varied and have distinct themes. Graphics are pretty good, some of the prettiest I’ve seen among VR titles. Also every location is really well crafted, with great attention to detail and little secrets scattered around. To be honest, I would have expected nothing less by Valve, and I wasn’t disappointed.

The gameplay includes all the aspects of the first two games: shooting, puzzle solving, physics, of course really well integrated with the VR technology. Interactions with the environment feel mostly natural and intuitive. 

Of course for the sake of simplicity and in order to avoid over-burdening first time players, some aspects of the game are dialed down in comparison to the older titles. The game is slower in general, combats are easier and there are fewer enemies and guns (even though they are all enjoyable). Understandably, Valve wanted to create an enjoyable first VR game for those who are new to the technology, and I personally don’t see anything wrong with that. 

Indeed, the experience is really immersive. Since the game opens, with a strider walking the streets while we watch it from the balcony of our house, I felt sucked into the atmosphere of City 17, with the constant guerrilla warfare between the Combine and the Resistance reminding me somewhat of the partisans fighting the nazis during WWII. 

Seeing all of that from an up close and personal perspective for the first time was a unique feeling for me. It might be obvious but VR lets you get immersed in the games much more than a flat monitor. Also, 16 years have passed since the release of Half-Life 2, and the graphical improvements are apparent. I multiple times found myself getting close to the enemy corpses, picking them up or moving them around in order to observe them and appreciate the level of detail and care they were made with. Combine are big, especially the chargers, with their heavy armor, and they feel really imposing.
There is a more survival horror oriented section in the game, when you meet “Jeff”, which was pretty intense [spoiler]especially when you end up locked in the elevator with them[/spoiler] and also brought up some memories of other titles (for example the berserker section in the first Gears of War) or some Alien movie vibes.  

About the plot, I don’t want to spoil more than I already wrote, so I’ll just say I liked it and it was on the same level of the other mainline games (if we want to consider this a spin-off), both writing and storytelling wise. 

Sound has the same level of detail and polish as the rest of the game, being able to convey every necessary gameplay hint (spacial sound is a must for VR). Thankfully all the classic sound effects are there, and I felt right at home with the health stations (unfortunately no HEV suit and no HEV chargers are in the game).

Music, on the other hand, alongside the classic HL2’s “Hazardous Environments”, offers some high-impact tracks, perfect to convey the various emotions and situations we find during the playthrough.

I played this game with a Quest 2 and a pretty beefy PC: 5800X3D and 6950 XT. I was able to play with everything maxed and even though I didn’t check my framerate often, I never felt the need to decrease my graphics settings since everything was really smooth. Funnily enough every time I launched Alyx, I got a pop-up message in the main menu warning me that with my setup I might have gotten sub-par performance with those settings. It wasn’t the case, after all.

In conclusion, I really loved this experience. I know some people expected a more “Half-Lifey” title and were turned off by the slow pace of the game, but I personally think this, being somewhat a spin-off, doesn’t necessarily need to be in line with the mainline titles. I enjoyed it for what it is, and I will surely try out the HL2 VR mod eventually, and decide whether I prefer that over Alyx. But even if that was the case, I’d still firmly recommend this one. 
Hopefully VR will get more accessible in the future so that a wider audience can adopt it and the medium can keep evolving and we can have some more new gems like this one.

The combat was not very good. I don’t know if it was because I was bad or because the game didn’t teach me how to fight well, but I died many times and it was frustrating. Whenever a fight started I thought to myself “Oh drat, more combat”. A shame.

The puzzles were smart and pleasing to solve.

Gameplay was varied. It never got stale.

The story was a bit sparse. Rescue Eli Vance and retrieve the weapon. I wish there had been more story.

I kind of wish it had been shorter. I feel like VR experiences should be short and sweet.

I struggle to find good VR games since I was blown away by Boneworks, and this is one of the first games to do it all again. Not only does it have a good story, expands on characters we know and love, and have beautiful environments, it encases you in all of it with an extremely immersive atmosphere and some of the best VR gameplay on top. The gunplay is so fun, and the upgrades you get make it even better.

And tell me how on Earth they made it so fun to simply pick up objects?? The gravity gloves were always so fun to use. The physics engine in this great (albeit not quite as good as Boneworks', imo) and the details like the liquid inside the bottles moving and just being able to smash the supply crates and pick up ammo. All the simple tasks are made fun, and they never got boring for me.

Being able to fight headcrabs and whatnot was amazing, but one thing I didn't expect was my first encounter with the Combine. My god, seeing the oppressive, gene-modified soldiers right in front of me was terrifying, in the best way possible. It's not even that they're hard to fight especially, moreso that the atmosphere of the game makes their appearance just fabulous.

Man, I could go on and on about this game, even more than I have. I just want more of it, although I am glad they ended it where they did! It took me 12 hours to beat, which is extraordinary for a VR game. I guess i'll look into the workshop items and stuff... wow.

I can hands down say this is the best and most impressive gaming experience I’ve ever had. The graphics are so much better that I thought I would get with a quest 2 wireless over my bog standard home router. It is 5.2 hz channel and I have a 3070 in the PC but runs impressively smooth compared to any vr title I’ve ever played before. 

Attention to detail is impeccable and a standard it seems none else can replicate. I’m only 5 chapters in and I’m already feeling like I will have a scratch that I just can’t itch by the time I have finished. 

Have to play or experience at least once.

Still wish for closure to the HL2 story though. :)

A must-play for Half-Life fans, and those interested in what VR is capable of.

Recaptures the HL2 atmosphere perfectly.  Environments, sounds, and enemy designs will be instantly nostalgic to series veterans.  A great romp thru a post-apocalyptic eastern Europe city, with plenty of Combine installations and alien-warped weirdness to pick your way thru.  Dunno if they MEANT to make it scarier than its predecessors, but it's definitely a tense experience, especially since your physical clumsiness will be amplified by hand controls.  Shooting here will make you appreciate how much easier it is to aim with a mouse.

Brilliant level design, with tons of puzzles and interactables to make the most of your hand controllers.  It's playable seated, but standing VR does help with working your way thru physics objects (and with responding to enemies).  If seated, I recommend a stool for freedom of arm movement- you'll definitely want it...

Some of the voice actors have changed, which I have mixed feelings about- they're not bad, just... different (maybe just cuz I've played the series a few times, and am noticing the differences too much).  Not the biggest fan of Russell, but he's alright.  Some parts at the end rely a bit too much on the crappy throw controls- grenades were my least favorite weapons here...

God damn what a twist of events in the Story.
The Game might have a Dynamic Difficulty tweaking in the case of Ammo but idk about it being true. Enemys remain the same amount and health, just ammo is affected.


Best Part probably has to be [spoiler]when you encounter any Strider in the Game. Especially the one you get to shoot with a Combine Turret near the End. =) [/spoiler]

Things that couldve been better is the Music fading out way too early after fights. Basically kill the last entity and the music just fades out in 3 seconds, maybe make it like 10 seconds instead.

Things i disliked so far was the Grenade Tutorial and the electro Enemys, including the [spoiler]low Gravity Grenade Part right before the End.[/spoiler]
They force you to hit a Grenade throw into a small Vent to proceed, and it just spawns infinite nades until you manage to hit it. Only thing i hit after 20 tries was my Ceiling Fan...

Electro Enemys are just bullet sponges or deal insane Damage. [spoiler]And god damn those blue Ant Lions suck dick. Also the Minigun Combine deal mad Damage and i only played on Normal instead of Hard.[/spoiler]",1585012547,1703779853,True,1,0,0.527972042560577393,1,True,False,False

Nothing to say about this game other than it is a revolution and from what I know, there is still no other game in VR that is this good. (except MS FS of course but this is different)
Hopefully, they are preparing us a new VR episode like this. The graphics are already on top of the world with Alyx even 10 years after the release, so I cannot imagine what Valve will achieve in the next episode. Well, it will be probably like in the real life... Scary !
To conclude, I will say that this game is a better experience than every other video game AND movie you ever saw or played. Bravo Valve... Bravo.

As a longtime fan of the Half-Life series, I was eagerly anticipating Alyx, and it exceeded all my expectations. The level of immersion achieved in this game is unparalleled, thanks to the stunning graphics, meticulous attention to detail, and innovative use of VR technology.

The game's narrative is captivating, seamlessly integrating into the broader Half-Life universe while introducing new characters and plot twists that kept me on the edge of my seat. Alyx Vance takes center stage as a strong and compelling protagonist, and her journey through the dystopian City 17 is both thrilling and emotionally resonant.

The gameplay mechanics are nothing short of revolutionary. The intuitive VR controls make interactions with the environment feel natural, and the physics-based puzzles and combat add a layer of realism that I've never experienced before in a game. The sense of presence and scale in virtual reality is breathtaking, and every moment feels like a true adventure.

The attention to detail in the game world is remarkable, from the atmospheric environments to the lifelike animations of both characters and creatures. The sound design further enhances the immersive experience, with every creak, echo, and distant sound contributing to the overall atmosphere.

Half-Life: Alyx is not just a great VR game; it's a testament to the potential of virtual reality as a storytelling medium. Valve has once again demonstrated their commitment to pushing the boundaries of gaming, delivering an unforgettable experience that sets a new standard for what is possible in the world of virtual reality. If you have a VR headset, Half-Life: Alyx is an absolute must-play that showcases the future of gaming.

The gravity gloves are an ingenious way to integrate a long grab seamlessly and naturally. After long sessions, I would take my headset off and try to gravity glove grab my water bottle from across the room. Enemies are fun to fight, especially the big combine dudes with the machine guns, since you have to be very careful when fighting them. I also loved how you could be fighting, and they would have a gas tank or grenade strapped to them that you could exploit for explosive kills. Another example is a section near the halfway point of the game, called Jeff. Not to spoil but the Jeff section is so interesting, as he plays differently than any other section of the game. The atmosphere was so tense, and it feels like hes right in the room with you. The graphics, both close-by models, as well as vistas and backgrounds, were beautiful. I played on the highest graphics settings and this was probably the most graphically beautiful games I've ever played. Segments outside were my favorite, because you got to see the beautifully rendered backdrops. For flaws, my biggest is the major lack of shotgun ammo. There was such a low amount of shotgun shells that I probably acquired around 80 shells in the whole game compared to the 1500 or so pistol bullets or 4000 or so rifle bullets. Its quite disappointing as the shotgun is probably the most fun weapon in the game, barring the ending sequence. Amazing game, I got it on sale but would happily have payed full price.

This was a pain to finish it, but at the end of the journey it was worth it.

I do like this game, just I would like more action shooting than obvious jump scare and horifique environment that make me think I play the wrong game, but at the end this is still a Half-life.

Before I get into the review, I wish to make it clear that I played Half-Life: Alyx using a NOVR mod. A lot of people are saying that it completely ruins the experience but thankfully the mod was done very well. It did not feel like I was just walking through the levels, it felt like I was playing Half-Life: Alyx if that makes sence. The mod allows you to pretty much experience like 70-80% of what playing with a VR headset would feel like, having animations for Alyx, fully working puzzles and so on. The mod is still a work in progress so I can't wait to replay the game is a couple of months when the mod improves even further. I don't think I am allowed to post links into a steam review, but if you wish to check out the mod, its on Moddb and its called HLA-NoVR. Extremely easy to use, you just download the game through Steam, and then download the file from Moddb and use its launchable file. But anyway, about Half-Life: Alyx. I simply loved it. I had some issues with the story here and there, mostly because this is a prequal and it's in a bit of a disagreement with some things from Half-Life 2 and its expansions, but I forgive them. If you have a VR, what are you waiting for, buy it. If you are like me and get sick from VR headsets, buy it anyway and use a NOVR mod.",1703546385,1703546385,True,2,1,0.528596162796020508,0,True,False,False

From the moment you don the headset, you're transported into the dystopian world of City 17, and the result is nothing short of breathtaking.

The game's narrative, set between the events of Half-Life and Half-Life 2, revolves around Alyx Vance, a character known to fans of the series. The storytelling is expertly crafted, with a compelling mix of suspense, intrigue, and that signature Half-Life mystique. The VR medium allows for an unprecedented level of immersion, as players physically interact with the environment, uncovering the secrets of the Combine and the enigmatic G-Man.

The visuals in ""Half-Life: Alyx"" are nothing short of stunning. The Source 2 engine is leveraged to its fullest, bringing City 17 to life with a level of detail that's truly immersive. The attention to environmental design and the intricacies of VR interactions create a world that feels tangible and lived-in. From the eerie corridors of abandoned buildings to the vastness of outdoor environments, each setting is a testament to Valve's commitment to pushing the boundaries of virtual reality graphics.

Gameplay mechanics are where ""Half-Life: Alyx"" truly shines. The intuitive VR controls, coupled with the gravity gloves, redefine how we engage with the virtual world. Picking up objects, solving puzzles, and engaging in combat feel remarkably natural. The blend of exploration, puzzle-solving, and intense gunfights creates a dynamic and engaging experience that keeps players on their toes throughout the game's duration.

Combat is a highlight, with a diverse array of weapons and enemies that demand strategic thinking. The VR platform allows for an unprecedented level of control and precision, making each firefight a visceral and adrenaline-pumping experience. The gravity gloves add an extra layer of strategy, enabling players to catch, inspect, and use objects in creative ways.

Sound design is a critical component of the Half-Life experience, and ""Alyx"" doesn't disappoint. The atmospheric soundtrack and ambient noises contribute to the tension and immersion, enhancing the overall sense of presence in the virtual world. The attention to detail in audio cues, from distant echoes to the subtle hum of Combine machinery, further deepens the player's connection to the environment.

While ""Half-Life: Alyx"" sets a new standard for virtual reality gaming, it does come with the caveat of requiring high-end VR hardware. The investment in a compatible headset and controllers may be a barrier for some players, but for those who make the leap, the payoff is extraordinary.

In conclusion, ""Half-Life: Alyx"" isn't just a game; it's a landmark achievement in virtual reality storytelling and gameplay. Valve has successfully translated the essence of the Half-Life universe into a medium that feels tailor-made for its narrative and mechanics. From the gripping story to the unparalleled level of immersion, ""Half-Life: Alyx"" is a must-play for anyone seeking a truly transformative virtual reality gaming experience. Valve has not just raised the bar; they've set a new standard for what's possible in the world of VR gaming.",1676598902,1703531750,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Unfortunately, I didn't have a possibility to play it, but I really wanted to...

Couple of weeks ago I took Valve Index (rent it) :) 
I've tried couple of different games in VR, I felt nausea after some time,
but here I played one day 12 hours in a row and next day around 7 hours.
I didn't feel any issues... Yea, my legs hurt :D

This game has lots of action packed moments, shootings, puzzles, horror, humor, breathtaking monents. 
It goes along with a really nice story.

I would say that Half-life Alyx made a revolution again, but in this time - in VR world.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.

Started on the WON servers and been on Steam since day 1. This is one of those games that always alluded me because of it being VR. I even purchased it a few months ago after hearing the 2D mod was getting really good. Realized recently that having an ROG Ally + 6850M XT dock I could probably run VR to some extent, I got weirdly giddy at the idea that I would finally get to play this game. Picked up an HTC Vive OG setup for cheap and first time getting it up and running I played 2 hours straight before I realized I had probably been playing for a while. It's like nothing I ever expected. Prior to this the closest I came for VR was an old GearVR and that was just awful. Used to give me headaches and make me feel sick. 3D TVs never bothered me so I just assumed it was something about VR that bugged me that may be different. I am happy to report that was not it, no headaches and no dizzy episodes with this setup (except for when I loaded a different game I thought had teleport movement and it did not and I was not prepared, went flying across the area I spawned in and then just about wanted to hurl lol, i'm slowly getting used to moving that way.) 

The hardest part of VR for me, is to remember that I can physically move and hide from enemies and that I can actually duck behind things and that I can dodge headcrabs and spin 180 and blow them away. I keep wanting to stand still and just turn and shoot. 

My only complaint and it is very minor, is a little more than midway through you meet a specific creature from HL2 and I had one pin me up against a wall and that turned pure stupid. When you try and move through something solid the screen goes orange and blinding orange. So I basically got pinned, ended up blinding orange and even walking forward wouldn't stop that. So I'm blinded orange, pinned and can't do anything. Eventually I guess I sort of glitched out and i could move away and then shoot it, but that was a few minutes of pure annoyance. Considering how amazing the rest of the game has been thus far, it's not remotely ruined my experience and it would not prevent me from playing the campaign again. Only half way through or so and already ready to replay it again and already have a handful of custom maps downloaded and ready to go!

I'm 29 now, and I probably first sat down at a computer when I was like 3 or something. Between the ages of 4 and 5, I was already diving into Half-Life (1998), and by the time I hit 5, I had conquered it. Half-Life became my first major storyline game and my all-time favorite game series for the rest of my life.

[h1]I was eagerly waiting for Half-Life 2.[/h1]
And it hit me right in the feels with its gripping narrative and the tech engine's capabilities, not to mention the game designers' wizardry. Then came the two epic episodes with an ending that just left me itching to know what happens next.

[h1]And bam, here comes ALYX![/h1]
Breaking the boundaries of player-game interaction, delivering a totally fresh gaming experience. Once again, an awesome storyline with a killer ending that's got me itching and hoping for Gabe's not-so-favorite number, Half-Life 3.

Physics are the best ever in a game. Doors, bottles, grenades and chairs, all have weight to them, and you can almost feel it, they behave exactly as real world objects would. It is amazing that a game can replicate physics as well as Alyx can.

Music and sounds are also spot on, but it is the visuals and mechanics that truly sell the game for me.
This is still the best looking video game I have ever seen, and that even when played in low to medium graphics quality. The level design perfectly takes advantage of all the visual fidelity the game can offer, everything is alive and reactive to touch, creatures crawl beneath your feet and the walls breath and try to bite you, and it is all so real you simply cannot feel not immersed. 

As far as the plot and gameplay go, it is pretty good. The puzzles are fun to solve and the terrain is always interesting to traverse. Levels in the dark are absolutely terrifying and messing with combine tech is always a welcome challenge. The gunplay is brutal and punishing, grenades feel truly dangerous, if it weren't for those fucking flying bay-blades and the combine feeling a little too spongy for me I would say combat is pretty much perfect, but that's coming from someone who has yet to play the previous Half Life games.

The performance in very open (like some levels in chapters 3 and 6) and vast environments is pretty bad and immersion breaking, but since most of the game takes place in smaller environments I wouldn't consider it a deal breaker. 

One thing that is pretty annoying and pretty much the only reason that I don't have multiple hundreds of hours in this game is just how long the loading screens are, both to first load the game and between levels and deaths. If you want to play this game, you basically have to install it on an SSD, otherwise you will keep experiencing 4+ minutes loading screens every time die or you advance a level. 

All around, even with those problems, the game is still one of my favorites of all time and I still plan to enjoy it for many more tens of hours. I haven't touched the Mods in this review because I haven't tried those many of them out, but from the small experiences I had, it is safe to say they add lots of content and are pretty good.

9/10 because of the loading screens and the flying bay blades.

Gaben must have entered a pact with the devil and gotten some black magic in return to make the game look this good while not being ridiculously difficult to run. Most VR games, even the ones that look good, get somthing wrong with anti-aliasing and you get jagged lines/flickering on distant objects. Alyx has none of that. Everything is smooth in all distances. Lighting is really good, giving every moment and view almost cinematic feel. Dark places are pitch black. At times it looks eerily realistic. Physics on objects are top notch. There is a lot of details, that didn't need to be there, but help the immersion a lot. Story is okay, ending is so so, but it honestly doesn't matter that much. It's secondary to fooling around with grav gloves and exploring the environment.

Now a negative: the enemies are dumb and spongy, that makes the combat kinda boring over time. It's a problem a lot of games have. It's not that bad here but I wish that game studios would scale difficulty by making combat more fast paced and punishing/revarding, rather than making enemies eat more bullets.

_______________________________________

I am so bummed to have to give this a thumbs down for now.

Until smooth turning is fixed/implemented (unclear at this time if this is intended or not) I won't even be leaving Alyx's balcony.

For anyone who doesn't understand why this is a problem, imagine if Half Life 2: Episode 3 launched on desktop, but it was with a forced 65 degree FOV. 

""we chose not to include FOV options over 65 degrees because it causes some users to be motion sick""

Haven't we learned that [i]options[/i] are the answer?

Please Valve, don't force users into the lowest common denominator experience. You can still cater to audiences who need comfort settings without making those settings the only option for everyone.

VR games have been around for quite a number of years, but they've only really been pricey novelties, merely stoking the imagination for what AAA VR games might be like one day. 

And then comes Half Life: Alyx in 2020, to show everyone that the future has arrived.

[h1]Holy sh*t[/h1]
Were the first words that came out of my mouth when I experienced the world for the first time. The visuals were [b]incredible[/b] and utterly jaw dropping to look at. Clearly, Valve wanted to blow players away right off the bat.

And then I look to my side and I see a radio. [i]""Ah, let me just play around and see if I can turn the knob and extend the antenna- Holy sh*t I can actually do that?""[/i] 

As silly as that sounds, it was amazing to me just how much of the world could actually be interacted with. Even random things that don't add anything to primary gameplay like picking up markers and writing on glass was just incredible to me. I'd played VR games before, but never had I experienced this level of immersion and attention to detail. And all that was just in the first few minutes of playing the game! 

[h1]Progression and pacing[/h1]
Progression is done masterfully. The game starts off relatively slow, letting you walk around to get a feel of the controls while admiring the world around you, before introducing you to the tension and dread of walking through the dank and dark alien-infested underground, and then on to the adrenaline pumping gunfights. 

In short... this game is a ton of fun, from beginning to end.

[h1]Accessibility[/h1]
As someone who gets motion sickness from certain games and with the effects magnified by VR, I really appreciated the teleport movement and snap turning options. It was because of this that I never once experienced any sort of ""VR sickness"" while playing this game.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Half-Life: Alyx is everything the ideal VR game should be: immersive, captivating to look at, and most importantly, fun!

It took a little time to get a control configuration that worked for me. But once I did I felt unstoppable.

Wait, Is this game really a Half-Life?
Here's my review of the game as a veteran of the Half-Life franchise (I first finished the first installment in 2003, I finished all the games on PC and consoles a lot of times).
/!\ Warning, massive spoilers.

The 13 long years of waiting for HL2:EP3 or HL3 ends with the release of a so-called prequel in VR that no one asked for.
We start with an affront to the fans, how could this end well?

Here are the few positive points that I could identify:

The game has (kinda) beautiful graphics, 
thanks to the Source 2 engine and a pleasant physics engine.
The puzzles are well thought out although too numerous and redundant.
The weapon improvement system via ""resin"" is nice.
The Gravity Gloves as useful and versatile as the Gravity Gun.
The characters are charismatic, and can have a serious or humorous tone.
The music composed by Mike Morasky is appreciable, very electro and industrial, but is not as great as those of HL1 and HL2.
The sounds are very interesting, intriging, engaging and contribute to immersion.
City 17's Half-Life Alyx version is very classic, detailed, and great to look at and to explore.

But the list of negatives is quite heavy:

- Armament:
Ammo is too scarce so every bullet counts.
The enemies are too resistant compared to the weapons we have.
Only 3 weapons! I hadn't seen this since SiN Episodes: Emergence!
Some Combine Soldiers have weapons that cannot be picked up (probably because they are two-handed).

- Script
The story is too vague and has little connection to the rest of the series.
It really seems like the devs only had a vague knowledge of the lore.
Very few elements of HL2 Beta are recycled when there really is plenty to do.
The paranormal / gore side is way too exacerbated...
Where is Dog? He is supposed to protect Alyx since her childhood...
Where is Breen? Where is all the propaganda?

- Bestiary
If the bestiary is quite varied, but how to legitimize its disappearance before the events of Half-Life 2?
We had the same problem with the Race-X in Opposing Force long before...
The new enemies are not fun to fight for several reasons.
The Armored Headcrab is armored on top and only its ventral part is vulnerable.
The different Combine Heavy Soldiers are very resistant and their weapons hurt too much, even from afar. Like I said, we can't take their guns. They are similar to the Heavy Replicas from F.E.A.R. ...
The Antlion Soldiers are armored, they have to be dismembered so that you can shoot into their abdomen, causing them to explode!
Ditto for the Antlion Workers, except they spit a painful blue acid that coats the screen...
The worst of the worst from Half-Life Alyx's bestiary:
The Lightning Dog (Reviver): A kind of electric Headcrab that, in addition to electrocuting you and being resistant, can take control of corpses like the Remnant from F.E.A.R. 2 and land powerful attacks.
""Jeff"": A unique, blind, but not deaf zombie. I have no words, how to say... Why does such an abomination exist in the Half-Life universe? Who could validate this stuff?

- Scenery
If the city, on the surface is pleasant, it is not the same for the undergrounds, moreover too numerous. You will become claustrophobic.
The interiors are massively covered with a kind of biomass, dirty as possible, sometimes explosive. There too, we are closer to F.E.A.R. 2 for example.
The last chapter is closer to Portal 2. What is the visual affiliation with Half-Life 2?

- Dubbing
The game is only dubbed in English! Seriously! After dubbing the old Half-Life games in loads of languages!
However, it is subtitled in a few languages, even if it's easy to understand in the original version.

- Bugs:
I found myself several times and easily outside the map not knowing where to go...
We regularly find ourselves blocked everywhere for no reason.
Sometimes I can't grab ammo because it's stuck in the floor.

- Conclusion
Half-Life Alyx is for me a HUGE disappointment, as Half-Life games are legendary.
The ending of the game clearly calls for a sequel to HL2 Episode Two.
The game being what it is, Half-Life 3 could be ruined.
Better for Valve not to make it, and let's keep its legendary aura.
In the meantime, I'm going back to Half-Life 2 Beta.",1690755031,1702703823,False,27,6,0.49969211220741272,8,True,False,False

Comfort (how intense it is): 2/10 <- extremely good for those who get motion sick easily
Graphics: 10/10
Movement: 8/10 <- normal controller moving is extremely slow like even in combat wtf
Weapons: 8/10 <- I like the upgrade weapons thing however need more ammo for the shotty! like you only get 15 bullets the whole game yet its so good!

Combat: 9/10 <- challenging however hard mode fries not only my pc but also my brain from how many times i died
Price: 7/10 <- Would HIGHLY recommend getting this on a discount as I don't think most people have £50 to blow. Still even £20 is worth your money

Would I have paid $20 or $30 for this? Yes! Would I have paid $40? I'd have thought it over, and maybe waited for a sale, unless I was super bored. But for $60 dollars, I expected a lot more from this game - and it just didn't deliver.
Average game length is 12-13 hours, with around 20 if you explore every nook and cranny. Breaking down the math means roughly $3/hour. Compared to other ""shooter"" games, this is par for the course, but I was expecting a lot more time because it takes longer to do things in VR than it does in a typical run-and-gun.
Now I may just be splitting hairs. The game looks and plays quite well. I used a Quest 3 with Steam Link, cranked all the settings in Steam Link for maximum graphical fidelity. My rig has a Zotac Amp Extreme 2080 Ti; it is a beast of a 2080 Ti card. I noticed some hiccups on occasion but really no complaints, everything was smooth 99% of the time. Honestly, I was impressed.
I just wish it were longer, the bang didn't feel worth it for the buck - but if you DO spot this on sale, I would suggest grabbing it.

I will update the review after more playing.

Update:

The movement speed is SLOOOOOOOW. It feels like you are moving in slooow motion while using the free motion schema. You have to move with the left stick and at the same time teleport with the right stick to move forward!! Hopefully this could be tweaked in the future because it's just a value?

Update 2:
Wow. It starts a bit slow (Tutorial levels) but it's getting better for each chapter. I'm now at chapter 5 and it's a fucking amazing experience. 

Worth waiting for. Thanks Valve! 

What a time to be alive!

Update 3:
- How should I be able to play other games?
- Hard difficulty = too easy.

Update 2023-12-10:

- I'm playing this game using my brand new Meta Quest 3 wireless. It's a new experience once again. Experience this world with pancake lenses is really so much of a difference. Everything is so sharp. I'm rendering this game at 3000x3000 per eye and then it's streamed over to the Quest 3 over Wifi 6 AV1. No perceived lag and it's so scary. I really need a break now.

It's so sad that there are so few expeirences like this. Everything on the Quest is just mobile graphics and this is something else.

If Valve only could create a new Index. They probably only need:
- Pancake lenses
- Their old knuckles controllers are still fine
- Higher resolujtion panels.
- A wireless option for streaming HEVC/AV1 videos.
- I think inside out tracking might be easier to sell to new customers but I'm fine with their lighthouses to use Vive trackers etc.",1584992101,1702165643,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The beauty of the environments (even all decayed post apocalyptic world)!! the color and texture of mushrooms, and everything is so beautiful and I just log in and look around without playing. Just be in Alyx and that made me happy.

Another thing I enjoyed so much was finding the path to next step itself. And inventive way to kill monsters, not just shooting at them. 

What an astounding experience and I’m not even a gamer.. I mean, I have only finished Red Matter1, Myst, Lat Clockwinder and Alyx. 

My life will be empty now. No other VR game left would give me this much joy.

This game is nothing short of a groundbreaking achievement, showcasing the potential of VR as a transformative platform for gaming.

The narrative of Half-Life: Alyx is a gripping prequel to the events of Half-Life 2, following Alyx Vance as she fights to save her father from the Combine forces in the dystopian City 17. The storytelling is masterfully crafted, immersing players in the rich narrative tapestry of the Half-Life universe. The characters are engaging, the pacing is flawless, and the attention to detail in the world-building is awe-inspiring.

The introduction of VR adds an entirely new dimension to the Half-Life experience. The immersion achieved by Alyx is unparalleled, making players feel truly present in the game's meticulously detailed environments. From the awe-inspiring City 17 skyline to the eerie corridors of abandoned buildings, every location is a testament to Valve's commitment to pushing the boundaries of what is possible in virtual reality.

Gameplay mechanics in Half-Life: Alyx are a revelation. The intuitive controls, coupled with the intricacies of VR, provide a level of interactivity that goes beyond traditional gaming. From manipulating objects in the environment to solving puzzles and engaging in intense gunfights, every action feels natural and responsive. The gravity gloves, a new addition to Alyx's arsenal, are a stroke of genius, allowing for seamless interaction with the world and enhancing the overall sense of presence.

The visuals in Half-Life: Alyx are breathtaking. The Source 2 engine showcases the power of VR, delivering realistic textures, lighting, and physics that contribute to the immersion. The attention to detail in both character models and environmental design is nothing short of remarkable, creating a world that feels alive and dynamic.

The audio design is equally impressive, with a hauntingly atmospheric soundtrack and meticulous attention to spatial audio cues. The soundscapes of City 17 are as integral to the experience as the visuals, enhancing the sense of tension and urgency throughout the game.

While the VR requirement might be a barrier for some players, Half-Life: Alyx stands as a testament to the potential of virtual reality in gaming. It's not just a game; it's an experience that redefines what we thought possible in interactive entertainment. Half-Life: Alyx is not only a must-play for Half-Life fans but a milestone in the evolution of gaming as a whole. Valve has not only revived a beloved franchise but has set a new standard for immersive storytelling and gameplay in the realm of virtual reality.",1702020879,1702020879,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Highlights include fighting it out with soldiers, using cover and leaning out for real.   Fending off a head crap attack.  Searching in cabinets and boxes to find items.  The city scenery is really impressive. The control system and accuracy seems pretty decent with my rift although I am using 4 sensors.
 
I have had a number of crashes though - often when I think scenery or object boundaries are exceeded, as if it's not sure how to handle it.  Screen goes back on headset and monitor and when picture returns steam vr states it needs to restart.    Restarting the game and within a few seconds of trying the same thing it crashes again.  Often requires a pc restart.

Using a rift means that the oculus software is also loaded, which sometimes causes headaches if you hit the wrong button.  May have a better experience using the Vive or similar.

Highly recommended, even with the issues mentioned.

Update: not too long after posting the review I started getting a lot crashes back to desktop.  Appears that the radeon driver crashed, then the various vr apps.  Start again and it crashes after only a minute or too.  Getting unplayable.   Have installed latest drivers (supposedly with alyx support) - only difference is when it crashes it actually restarts my pc.  

When restarting the game I've been out of bounds a few times too, walking above ceilings, other sides of walls etc - and had to load an earlier save.

Have stress tested my pc with memtest, 3dmark stress test and others - and been fine.  Have tried numerous versions of the display drivers.  Have also installed a dedicated usb3 card encase it was a headset power issue - still crashing.  

Nothing overclocked, all stock, 64GB memory - and everything else I play has been fine.  At a loss here, and don't have an nvidia card to try - shame, as I was really enjoying the game up until now.  It's just frustrating now.

Update 2 - long overdue.  After a few AMD driver updates it became very stable and far more enjoyable as a result.  Highly recommended.  Recently purchased a Quest 3 so will be playing through again with it.",1585513049,1701721884,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've heard many people say that there should be a non-vr version, but that simply would not work. this game is meant to be played in vr. it would be a completely different experience if not for VR. the small easter eggs from past games are a great edition. 
and plus, it's Half-Life, why not get it
I really couldn't leave a bad review for a Half-Life game. Half life added story telling, Half Life 2 added physics and characters, this game is the reason why many people are buying VR headsets, as well as demonstrating what Source 2 is capable of.
I will say though, this game does require a pretty powerful PC to run, being 20x the file size of Half-Life 2, and 60x the size of Half-Life 1. 
The description does say it requires 12 gb of ram, but mine has ran pretty well on 8gb with only minor lag. I wouldn't say it's as large as Medal of Honor: Above and Beyond or Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach, but it's pretty close.
This is Half Life 3, not from an in-universe perspective, but from a game perspective
Edit for the Steam Link Version: If you are a quest 2 or 3 user, USE IT. If you have good internet but a lower end PC then link is the app for you. I've personally had many issues with lag in HLA because my specs are only able to account for the game itself, not the other side applications I had to use with it. With Link you can put all VR related issues on the quest and not your pc. With link you will get roughly the same visual quality (this depends on your internet connection, if you've used PS remote play you know what I mean) and your PC only focuses on running the game itself. not to mention that without the need for cables you have waaaay more range of motion which adds to the immersion. Obviously if you have a valve index and a high end pc then don't bother, this is just for my fellow low-spec players.",1595348934,1701591717,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I don't really want to say a lot about this game, because most of things I would have to say involve spoilers of varying degrees. But here's what I will say-

Source 2 is probably the best possible game engine currently in use. Valve's art style and physics are absolutely the best in the industry bar none, and they know it too. You will never play another game that even begins to hold a candle to the absolutely beautiful physics, graphics, AND optimization this game has.

The writing is absolutely top-tier, as always, but that's all I can say.

Voice acting is great, every one of the talents fit their character perfectly, and Russell was a welcome addition to the cast, bringing some not-cringe comic relief to an otherwise pretty dark setting.

The soundtrack is a masterpiece in it's own right, and pays homage to the older games.

So couple of days ago I have finished this game and I gotta say its pretty good. I played it personally with NOVR because I dont have vr headset and I dont have a interest in buying it, of course the real and possibly better experience is to play it with vr since youre not gonna have some of those issues that come with NOVR mod. Still its not bad I had some fun with it and couple of annoying parts that slightly bugged me.

[b]Pros:[/b]
+ The graphics look really good.
+ The sound design is also pretty good.
+ The NOVR gameplay is similiar to Half Life 2 except its slower and encourages more exploration if you wanna find scarce ammo, resin and health
+ Its suprisingly fun
+ Story is alright but....

[b]Cons:[/b]
- NOVR mod is still kinda janky, you often get stuck on props, rails and all kinds of junk. Sometimes you get softlocked forcing you to use noclip, aiming with pistol and smg is janky because it can stay zoomed in if you run out of ammo, the range when you throw grenade is short + its missing some weapon upgrades, mini games and other ,,vr'' interactions.

- There are some weird changes such as: You cant normally kill antlions, you have to shoot off their legs than their abdomen also they are slow compared to Half Life 2, the antlion workers for some reason looks different compared to Half Life 2 episode 2. For whatever the f**k reason there are no fast headcrabs, fast zombies and poison zombies, barnacles are not dying when they eat poison headcrab, different voice actress for Alyx.

- There are some retconned things in the story such as the infamous Russell which we dont know if hes still alive after Alyx storyline or not, different looking combines except civil protection, combine weapons being only usable with dna or other transhuman modifications, the zoo area kinda confused me since its couple of years since the combine occupies the earth (the blood on the tiger skull looked fresh imo, zombified zoo keepers can be seen in the area somehow surviving the place infested with the combine and antlions) ...etc

- The last 2 chapters where I was fighting the combines and especially strider was tough and really frustrating.

So do I reccomend this game ? Is it a meme or is actually worth ? Vr or NOVR ? Id say yes, I belive that its still worth it. I think its still a pretty damn good game and if I was a vr gamer I would consider it a proper vr game and not gloryfied tech demo. While its not the best Half Life game its still better than Blue Shift and maybe better than Half Life 2 episode 1 but Im still not sure about that.",1701383404,1701525671,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have been a long time HL series fan. I currently can't justify to myself for getting a VR set so I was pained to learn that HL: Alyx was going to be VR only especially with rumors of its ending actually continuing the end of HL2:EP2. However thanks to all of the work done by those at Half Life: Alyx NoVR Mod I was able to play through the latest installment and I was absolutely blown away by the experience. The mod was relatively easy to get setup. While things were a little clunky at times such as being restricted to one hand for actions, some bugs due to work arounds, and platforming being a challenge I was able to play through the entire game start to finish without getting stuck due to technical issues. I will admit I could understand that if you have a VR headset definitely to play it that way as the experience would be mind blowningly good. I thought that they did a good job of making it feel also like survival with a bit of horror thrown in.

The Story: The story of Half Life: Alyx is really well done, though raises some questions that never get answered. It was great getting to explore a more detailed area of C17 while learning more about Alyx before the events of HL2. All of the areas and new characters felt like they tied well into the world. My only issues with story and world building is wondering what happened to them as there is no mention of them nor the more advanced technology going away before HL2 begins. Where are my heavy combine soldiers in HL2? What happened to other characters that were involved in the plot since they are never mentioned in HL2? For the world it was fun to see Valve trying more organics in the world as I think they made it interesting and thought provoking. 

Graphics: I think that Valve did an amazing job with making the graphics both looking more refined to modern standards of 2020 while keeping the styles that the HL2 games where using. Everything felt like it had a place. Again this is where Valve having more organics in the environment really shows. Also the game seemed really optimized that even on my weird setup I was able to play on ultra at 1080p with never a hitch in graphics though I did have mild skybox artifacting but I blame it on my GPU. 

Gameplay: Methodical is the word that I would use to describe it. If you are used to the other HL games it definitely feels slow at first as the world is more confined to reduce movement needed in VR. This is encuraged by making you look through everything, I mean everything for health and ammo. You will be finding single shotgun shells hidden in drawers as there no longer are nice big boxes of shotgun shells. Though I will admit that they made the exploration feel interesting and not like a chore. It is amazing how much interaction that there is in the world so it feels weird when something can't be opened or picked up. The one thing that I found a little off / frustrating having played as the man with a PHd in firearms is that all of the enemies are tougher while at the same time you aren't as well equipped so it makes encounters more of a slog especially with restricted movement. A lot of the encounters with combine in the end involved me hiding behind something while one shot at a time widdling away at their health. Also there were points that required multiple reloads of the game. 

Overall: If you have a VR headset and you don't own HL: Alyx then you should. If you don't have a VR headset and are willing to put up with a few minor issues then I would definitely recommend Half Life: Alyx especially if you have enjoyed all other Half Life games.

Playing this currently with a NO-VR mod. Sure it doesn't have the Valve polish and there's some bugs but it's perfectly playable as it currently is if you are willing to accept it is STILL a VR game played with a mouse and keyboard, there are going to be some sacrifices/bugs and the mod page goes into detail.
So now finally I get to enjoy some new half life content without breaking the bank.
Also Valve pls release Half Life 3

UPDATE 1:
If you want to try the NO-VR mod, I'll happily list some of the bugs I've encountered:

-Firstly the main menu doesn't appear for me once in game. I have to alt-f4 once I've saved the game.
-The Jeff section is a bit broken with the NPC you meet, he gets stuck shortly after meeting him. Doesn't really affect gameplay as you can continue without him progressing.

Half-Life: Alyx. If you feel like you wanted to play half-life but something new, different, and more immersive... This game is all of those things. It features less guns then you'd experienced in the earlier half-life games, but the guns are pretty decent and allow for some creatively challenging gameplay.

Ammo management and generally good skill in combat left me usually reasonably flush with ammunition but the gun reloading and general handling is very good. Might annoy you if you're feel unwilling to deal with cover... as you are squishy, being Alyx instead of Gordon.

Story was pretty solid and sets up for a sequel, perhaps more of the same or more VR experiences. Either way, I enjoyed it and look forward to more.

Will say I had a few crashes while playing, but the saves usually had me right where I crashed, so... not that bad an experience at all. Might just be my inferior graphics card set-up anyway. Hope you enjoy~",1700894931,1700894931,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

Graphics: Graphics are decent. They aren't overly good or anything but they very much hold up to standard. There are some things that you won't find in most vr games like the liquid inside bottles (not really liquid, just a trick Valve uses but nonetheless impressive). I didn't notice any graphic breaking bugs in the game either. You can grab headcrabs so I guess that's cool. Characters in the game are also well made and hold up to standard.

Gunplay: The only weapons you will use are SMG's, pistols, and a shotgun. They all feel unique in their way but you still get that feeling as if you are shooting every gun as a pistol. You can't punch enemies or grab them until they are dead. Very disappointing actually, I expected there to be more gore in the game but was greatly disappointed with what it had to offer. 

Movement: The movement mechanic is very simple, you can't climb a ladder for fuck's sake, you can teleport to the top or bottom though. Very disappointing. There is nothing more to add about the movement, you don't use your arms for anything but shooting.

Story: The story is cool, I won't spoiler it but it is indeed made well and the game features a variety of interesting puzzles and new unique characters you will meet.

Rating: Overall I give this game 6/10 , not much to add.

RIP to players who didn't get the chance to play due to waiting for a decade plus. Anyway, let's hope the next game, either Half Life: Alyx 2 or Half Life 3 won't take another decade to be released or some of us would not even be ""here"" anymore before it is released, judging by the COVID-19 situation.

P. S. I completed the game on my other account, through Steam Family Sharing, and you can only comment with the owner account so the playing hours is inaccurate. 16 hours to complete since I procrastinate now and then, now 21 hours and ongoing as I am replaying again. I hate Jeff, killed it with the trash compactor and it was satisfying :3

If you have a VR Headset, play it. If you don't, buy one and play it.

The game uses a good split between exploring, pussle solving, and combat between different Enemies that keep getting stronger. 
You can play the game in the story-modus with weak enemies or in the normal or hard modus.

just like a lot of people, i waited long years for this one. always suspected its gonna be VR when it comes, but i never expected what they really did after all.

the storytelling and immersion in this game are surreal. its absurd how real the experience feels all aspects combined.
the touch and feel of it is just out of this world. so are the physics. and both artistically and graphically i think that no VR game comes even close as of late 2023. overall this is propably one of the best games i have ever played in general. the feel of its environmental storytelling is beyond words. even though this is primarily a linear game, the once in a while replay value hits hard. you can toy around with the mechanics and physics for ages. or just walk around looking at the world taking everything in piece by piece. or just experimenting with different combat moves and strategies in its sandbox-y shooter environment with lovely puzzles. what i appreciate most is that it does something much smarter than just continuing the cliff hanger we got in EP2. now i try to write my reviews as spoiler free as possible. im the kinda guy who barely watches trailers and likes to go in for surprises more often than not. but what i can tell you while being non specific is that this game does something much more interesting and puzzling with the narrative than just continue where we left of. at first it seems like a not so related prequel to half life 2 but later on the connection gets seriously intense to say the least. some of its own ends are closed here but i absolutely cannot wait to find out what happens next. also make sure you DO play at the very least half life 2 and episodes 1 and 2 before you go into HL ALYX. ideally also half life 1. they are incredible games that all play like they came out yesterday so if you somehow still didnt play them, knock youurself out.
cheers.

while part of this titles purpose is a game being experienced in a completely revolutionary way, there is another purpose it serves for the greater franchise as a whole. and that is an evolutionary one. and it serves that purpose with love, care and determination. this game sets a beautiful stage for possible endeavors into the half life portal universe. and ill be waiting eager as ever.

thank you valve for your dedication to this amazing franchise and always keeping up with your incredibly high quality standards. your games continue to entice and inspire and i believe this release shows that it can be worth it to be patient and wait in ease for something really great.

Developed by Valve Corporation, this installment in the iconic Half-Life series has set a new standard for immersive gameplay and storytelling within the VR landscape.

Graphics and Immersion: 5/5
The visual fidelity of Half-Life: Alyx is nothing short of breathtaking. From the intricate details of the environment to the lifelike character animations, every aspect of the game is designed to draw players into the dystopian world of City 17. The Source 2 engine truly shines, delivering an unparalleled level of realism that enhances the overall immersion.

Gameplay: 4.5/5
The gameplay mechanics of Half-Life: Alyx are a testament to the potential of VR gaming. The intuitive controls, precise interactions, and realistic physics create an experience that feels both natural and responsive. The game cleverly integrates VR features, requiring players to physically reach for items, solve puzzles, and engage in combat with a level of tactility that traditional gaming can't match.

Story and Atmosphere: 4.5/5
True to the legacy of the Half-Life series, Alyx doesn't disappoint in terms of narrative depth and atmosphere. The storytelling is engaging, weaving seamlessly into the existing lore while introducing new characters and plot twists. The oppressive ambiance of City 17 is palpable, and the game succeeds in maintaining a sense of tension throughout the entire experience.

Sound Design: 5/5
The audio in Half-Life: Alyx is a standout feature, contributing significantly to the overall atmosphere. From the haunting echoes of distant Combine chatter to the subtle creaking of dilapidated buildings, every sound is meticulously crafted. The use of 3D audio technology further enhances the sense of space and directionality, adding another layer to the immersive experience.

VR Innovation: 5/5
Half-Life: Alyx pushes the boundaries of what VR can achieve. It not only demonstrates the potential for narrative-driven VR games but also serves as a showcase for innovative design and interaction possibilities within the medium. The game sets a new standard for VR titles and has undoubtedly paved the way for future developments in the industry.

Half-Life: Alyx is a tour de force in virtual reality gaming. It successfully marries the rich storytelling of the Half-Life universe with the immersive capabilities of VR technology. While the need for VR hardware might limit accessibility for some, those with the means to experience it will find themselves transported into one of the most compelling and memorable gaming experiences of recent years.

game is way too small and way too short and way too linear
not that half life 2 wasnt linear but this game is like hyper linear
if youve played portal 2 u know what im talking about because it had the same thing
u cant even get yourself killed in the intro sequence by not putting ur hands up or trying to grab the guy's gun too many times like why put in dialogue that serves no purpose telling me to put my hands up if it doesnt actually matter
its like the entire game is one hallway with tons of doors on each side that are all locked
it feels like a rail shooter with no consequences or urgency and its kind of hard to feel any urgency or take anything seriously when both of the main characters are constantly making unfunny quips and not taking anything seriously
clearly a voiced protagonist was the wrong choice because alyx in this is so annoying and both alyx and russell for some reason think its important to point out what i can see with my eyes any time anything happens god forbid i have to think for myself
whoever directed did a terrible job because not even the known voice actor ellen mclain said her new lines right because no one was directing her and its a very stark contrast to the old lines they used directly next to the new ones
and alyx's coughing and choking sounds are so unbelievable theyre very clearly someone trying to fake cough and choke a good example would probably be the choking sounds from l4d when u get caught by a smoker which i for some reason remember sounding more convincing in this game
call it a nitpick but it shows a lack of attention to detail when they dont even do a second take
you dont even get to fight the metrocops because people would want to do that so they purposefully left it out and anything else people wouldve wanted like seeing barney and dr kleiner in vr because that makes a lot of sense its not like people have been itching for some more half life for over a decade so why would you put anything half life in your half life game other than some bullshit little tiddlywinks like the fuckin health charger sound and nothing else
alyx's gun doesnt even turn into a rifle or machinegun anymore i guess they just retconned that because that wouldnt be cool in vr would it :) the only thing that would make sense considering they wanted all the weapons to be one handed anyway so why would you want it to be a 3-in-1 gun :)
also all the guns are one handed which is really lame they really sacrificed interesting gameplay for ""comfort""
you can only move at the speed of an elderly grandmother and theres no running or sprinting so theyre really kneecapping themselves even from the beginning with what they can do by prioritizing ""comfort"" so the entire game can only take place in city 17 and youre only allowed to move at a snail's pace and you can only fight slow easily dodgeable enemies and because of that you have to have equally terrible weapons and a minimized amount of them because anything more would be unnecessary against the 3 enemy types there are which is one of the same problems i had with boneworks
the gunplay is actually decent despite there being only 3 weapons in the entire game
the sound design and soundtrack are so ugly and so sterile generic hollywood and all the explosions and gunshots do that hideous effect that some games do for some reason where theres like a laser gun sound effect for every gunshot and every explosion and it makes it sound so ugly like not every gunshot and sound effect from a machine of some kind literally has to sound like a laser gun
like half life 2 may not have had the best sound design but it wasnt this unpleasant to listen to
the entire soundtrack is just a generic hollywood cinematic soundtrack that ruins any atmosphere there wouldve been without it and theres literally no way to turn it off
you only have an option to turn off the kelly bailey ripoff battle songs which are ironically the only part of the soundtrack i actually like
the entire rest of the soundtrack isnt trying to do anything interesting its just trying to be as generic as possible because they cant be kelly bailey so they just gave up and went completely generic like i wouldve respected doing an independent thing from half life 2 more if they were clearly trying to do something interesting or even just do SOMETHING
or at least let me turn it off god lol
because theres one part where youre fighting the strider and its kind of different and almost interesting and if they went a little farther in a different direction then i wouldve liked it
the only part of the sound design i did like were the new zombie voices because its different and new but not completely detached from the half life universe like everything else in this game
they also changed all the strider sounds to this weird boring synth sound effect for some reason and it doesnt even sound like its coming from the striders because theres constantly music playing so it just sounds like theres some random synth sound effects playing as part of the music and i dont really know why they felt the need to retcon that completely like its not even an inbetween between the muffled distorted sounds and some new thing its just completely different and unrecognizable
all the headcrab sounds just sound like someone going REEE!! and its really hard to buy as an actual animal sound it just sounds like some guy impersonating a squealing pig and nothing else
the barnacles also sound like a guy whose voice they just pitched down rather than a real animal that i can buy as a real animal
or the alien equivalent of an animal like id rather them just used actual animal sounds rather than some guy's voice
the entire vortiguant intro sucked the writing was like a terrible sitcom, much like a lot of the other dialogue, but this vortigaunt is trying to tell alyx something important and shes just like ""haha no i dont wanna go with u smh silly crazy vortigaunt with brain damage :)"" like i didnt realize her character was so self-centered and condescending
its not even like they actually established that the citizens dont trust the vortigaunts or something she's just disrespectful for seemingly no reason and its never explained
u only really go around to small parts of city 17 in this game whereas in half life 2 u go to many different far apart areas for many different reasons but in this game u only really have one goal and one location youre trying to get to which is the vault youre not trying to help the vortigaunts or anything u only just happen to come across one on the way there coincidentally because the vortigaunt was what was powering the vault's cables
a lot of things in this game seem like they were just done at the last second like firing merle dandridge and scrapping the cremator again and the crowbar or the amount of retcons (excluding the ending) plus the shortness of the game and non-depthy storyline
it really just felt like i was passively watching a movie or just playing a rail shooter with an inconsequential plot especially in the vortigaunt intro
i wish they wouldve put some new synths in or something interesting to fight like the hunters
the headcrab miniboss is the worst enemy in the entire game its a total bullet sponge and its not fun to fight and it really didnt need to be a bootleg headcrab it even wouldve made more sense for it to have been a synth anyway but they just made it like this gearbox fanfic race x alien that isnt very half life at all
also most background noises are some kind of music in some way like i get appreciating music and all but not every sound effect has to be musical
and also the manhacks make this loud alert siren sound for some reason which doesnt really make any sense because the fan blades are supposed to already be loud enough for u to notice them coming thats the entire point
i think thats it definitely not worth $60 maybe worth 30-$40

It means to them technological revolution at all means. 
Remember HL1 when it first released? Lots of voices around the world told the same thing: it's a revolution!
What about HL2? They introduced Source engine with the best physics possible at the moment. 

The game is not that much about the plot, although the storytelling is amazing...

Simply switching to Source 2 and delivering standard PC experience wouldn't revolutionize gaming. 
But using other delivery methods with fully-immersive environment and one of the best graphic possibilities - that's the revolution and the push to the world of widely known PCVR gaming.

Valve, in general, is a company that opens the door to the future of diversified gaming. When they delivered Steam to us, great physics, Steam controller (although it's a failure from business point, the controller is great), Index helmet, Deck.

Some puzzles at later stage even requires PRECISE motion control which is a challenge in VR due to the instability of controller tracking.

Not to mention getting stuck at multiple points in the game trying to figure out where exactly you should be headed.

It's not a cut-down experience made to work with VR, it's a full-fledged VR game. Unfortunately, so many years in, that's still the case. There are some issues with weapon handling that could be improved, but a lot of that comes down to bulky and inaccurate controllers.

As for the negatives, I'm not a fan of ammo-scarcity in games, and this game has a TON of it. Weapons don't seem to have enough power to taken anything down without hitting very small hit boxes (again, bulky and inaccurate controllers), so I find myself using a lot more ammo than I would otherwise. And when you do find ammo, it's one mag here, two shotgun shells there, etc. Occasionally, you'll find an ammo box, but that usually means you're about to fight a bunch of enemies, so you'll be out again soon.

The biggest issue I have is with performance. Every so often after the game loads I'll drop down to 10fps, and nothing seems to get it to go back to normal. I'll have to completely shut everything down and start it back up again. Also, even worse, sometimes the game will completely lock up my entire computer to the extent that I have to hard reset. It's the only VR game I have this issue with, and it's a very serious issue.

I'll explain at the top of this, I can't seem to play through Alyx on Virtual Desktop without SteamVR crashing. It's the only game that does this in my Steam library. Reloading a checkpoint or loading a new chapter causes freezing on the loading view and forces me to just stop entirely. I haven't played more than 10 minutes since SteamVR's 2.0 update

[Meta Quest 3 + Virtual Desktop | 3060TI/i5 9600k]
3070 Graphic Settings + HEVC 10 bit Encoding + 200mbps
I get around 45-50mbps Latency which is my usual, a little stuttering with multiple enemies on the field but not a major drawback as the HEVC 10 bit Encoding provides much more colour accuracy at the cost of this, otherwise use HEVC and have fun

[Half-Life: Alyx]
I've not really played Half-Life, closest i've come is Portal so i'm not unfamiliar with the games feel. 

Believe it or not, but I too am one of those ""Its the best VR game ever"" people, seriously even in 2023 and without playing the latest VR titles I know this is S tier. It really provides the full action-rpg experience i'd expect from a large studio, and is definitely a feel of Half-Life in the newer age
There's very little bad to say about the core game, it provides most VR options and has thought through a lot of the ways this game can be experienced

Game wise its a simple-ish action game, from tense dark scenes to grand almost cut scene level visuals all in VR which is very impressive and just like VR, very difficult to explain without ""being there""
It's also one of the longest VR games i've played really (around 10 - 15 hours YMMV). Other VR games are 30mins - 1hr of either roguelike rounds or just the full experience, and i'm tired of that. 

With Half-Life Alyx I can really see in the right hardware going for full sessions of 4+ hours, and I can see with the Quest 3 + hardware accessories, you could really get there

And that's not just going into the 10/10 game design for every part of the game (Except Jeff).  Valve may not put out games often, or ever again, but when they decide to make a 3d single player story driven game they really knock it out of the park.

Edit: I've played this game an extra 38 hours and the green lighting has never activated properly. It keep failing to activate or targeting rocks instead of enemies.

And for me imposes way to many restrictions on movement and no jumping, no sprinting. (these things are loved by hard core VR users) I get that some people can't take it, but it feel like I am playing with my feet in sand with even the most free locomotion settings. Many of us VR players want normal jump and sprint. And I personally refuse to ever use teleport in a game. It was almost a deal breaker in this game, since it ruins any fun that can be had in the paltforming sections. I mean you just point and click, really? How is that even fun? IMO Hard mode should force you to use full locomotion with no teleport and real jump. That is what hard core VR people like me want.

That being said this game is a rare gem in VR. Graphics that blew me away every time I put back on the headset. Levels so rich with detail and more physical interactivity that you can find in almost any game. Other than maybe Boneworks. I wish the physics could be used more in combat. You can't hit head crabs with bricks or boards with any real effect other than maybe moving them a little. But there is no denying that this is currently the TOP AAA VR game for PC. Any lover of VR will have a complete blast playing this game. And will be ready to buy #2, 3, 4 of this quailty of immersive VR game. Great job Value !!

-No toggle grip for items
-Stupid Rick & Morty writing(Hey old timer scientist how do you know what a flobby disk is? UHh, I downloaded the whole internet to know. That is furking cool dude.)
-Some cool physics but nothing to play with really like half life 2 allowed you to play around with various different sized objects. ""Uhh actually you can play with a marker and draw boobs with a swaztika on it"". Yeah various little dumb objects that you can only look at and ""sometimes"" use. There was a medium size stick that looks like it was sharpened on the ground and you can't pick it up/use it. I couldn't move any of the gurneys or crates to play with. Also what weakling can't pick up a small wicker chair by one leg without instantly dropping it. Alyx can't do this and yet she took on a squad of combine single handily in half life 2 hand to hand winning in the process. LET ME HAVE FUN GABE!
-Vortiguant entrance puzzle is easy but why do you need to release pieces of cardboard for it to tell you to press two buttons on a peg button board that some brain dead dev thought was cool? 
-Shooting is boring and the attachment sight half the time doesn't show the reticle on the screen.
-60 bucks of mediocre that they also expect you to pay $500 to $1000 dollars for depending on which headset you bought.

Ladies and gentlemen, dust off your VR headsets and prepare for a trip to the not-so-distant future where ammo is apparently more precious than toilet paper in a pandemic! Introducing Half-Life: Alyx, the game where you constantly feel like you're on a desperate scavenger hunt for bullets. And no, it's not Half-Life 3, so let's just get that out of the way before someone starts a rumor!

In this thrilling VR escapade, you'll be facing off against adversaries, only to look down and realize: ""Wait, where did all my ammo go?!"" You defeat them, only to run low again. And then you move on, triumphantly... and yep, you guessed it, you're out of ammo. Again. Makes you wonder if the game secretly doubled as a rationing lesson. (I swear I wasn't trying to shoot stars out of the sky, but a gamer can dream, right?)

But don't let the sporadic scarcity of bullets fool you. The graphics? Immaculate. The gameplay? Seamless. The feeling of desperately searching for ammo while an alien is chasing you? Priceless. Or should I say... bulletless?

If you've ever wanted to experience what it's like to be both awed and mildly irritated at the same time, then Half-Life: Alyx is the game for you. The VR mechanics are spot on, and aside from occasionally wanting to scream, ""WHERE IS THE AMMO?!"", you're in for an authentic and enthralling Half-Life adventure.

Graphics are incredible with the fancy Source 2 engine, displaying highly detailed character models with impressive facial animation. Physics have been improved greatly, being able to fully show the realistic weight of certain objects. And while certain beloved characters such as Barney and Kleiner don't make a return, we're introduced to a British chap named Russel, who's still as enjoyable as those we've seen in Half Life 2. Plus, and this isn't a spoiler, but it expands on the story despite being a prequel :)
My only gripes with the game is that it's incredibly laggy on slightly lower-end systems, and you'd need the Valve Index to truly experience this game to it's fullest. And while it does make sense to have it be geared for extremely high-end systems and build the game off of the headset your company made, it's frustrating to have to know what graphics card you need to run the game on just the lowest settings and not be bombarded with lagspikes. I use a GTX 1070 on 32 gigs of ram with the Oculus Rift S and can barely get an extremely clear, smooth image.
But despite those, I love this game. It's one of the last games to fully revolutionize gaming as we've reached our limit at this point. Can't wait to see what Half Life 3 will have to offer once we get to that point. Valve isn't very well-known for making games in a small timeframe, but that just shows their dedication. We had almost a whole decade of nothing but updates for Team Fortress 2 and CS:GO.

Honestly this is one of the greatest VR games I have ever played, it's well worth the $60.

I played on a Quest 2 through cable on the lowest settings, and despite one glitch appearing (When the combine are driving you in the back of their truck, it loaded as an error for a couple of seconds) it ran BRILLIANTLY. 

There's one fixed movement speed to avoid motion sickness, but also an ability to dash around if you need to quickly get somewhere. Climbing up things is smooth, if you ever let go of a ladder it just teleports you to the top. All of the guns are one handed, which is a change I really appreciate, but I can't think of a reason why, I just like it.

It's also one of the best looking games I've played in years. The environment looks real, like these places aren't well kept, only used by the combine who just cares about keeping the humans in check.

Overall, 10/10 game. If you have a VR headset, buy this game. It will make you a fan of the half-life series (at least it did for me.)",1638138081,1697659419,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

Only thing that kept me playing was I wanted to see the end.

They somehow found a way to turn every single door way into a puzzle, even going to upgrade your guns requires a puzzle.
I grew up on HL1 & 2 but this is a little much. I think they were running short on ways to keep the player engaged when not in combat or picking up on parts of the story. 

Having to line up floating orbs and match symbols to progress every 10 minutes as a way of engaging the player is the equivalent of a 60 second video split-screened with subway surfer gameplay",1690511526,1697423834,False,7,6,0.482843101024627686,0,True,False,False

  I do strongly feel there should be a sprint button, more enemies, and more weapons, but I understand Valve is scared of overwhelming new VR players.  Dont be!  we can handle it!  Hell throw in some fast vehicles too :). Aside from these gripes, everything else is absolutely perfect.

[h3] Introduction [/h3]
To this day, hands down the best PCVR experience the money can buy. Even if you are not familiar with the Half-Life franchise, give it a chance; you will unlikely be disappointed. If you care deeply about the performance aspect and worry if your setup can handle it - the game is highly optimized and rarely causes any frame drops. After all, a refund is always a possibility. The trailer will never do it for you in the same way the game could.

[h3] Story & World Building [/h3]
All the details within make this world feel truly alive, unlike any other VR environment that looks fake at a glance. The pure quality of assets used and clever level design together play a great role in immersing you as a player. The narrative is delivered seamlessly; you are always present in the world, and it actually responds to your actions. Intensive scenes are executed perfectly, and the VR itself adds much more depth than you can ever imagine.

[h3] Compatibility Concerns [/h3]
Being originally designed to showcase the true spectrum of VR interactions Index is capable of, the game holds well when it comes to other headsets and conrollers. Unique features like squeezing the palm of your hand while holding an object were simply rebinded to an action button within your reach. It means that regardless of your current VR setup, the game will adapt and provide as much content as it can without leaving some of it behind.

[h3] Conclusion & Final Notes [/h3]
The magnitude of hard work and dedication that the Valve team put in when making this game can never be expressed enough. It is a unique, mesmerizing, and engaging experience that will last you hours upon hours and will still be able to surprise you, catch you off guard. Words don't do justice at this point, and if you made it this far - treat yourself and explore the world of Half-Life: Alyx to its fullest.",1697019551,1697019551,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Worth the wait for the most part. A stunning return to one of my favourite universes. Some truly god-like design and world building; driven by a fun engaging cast. Seriously the voice work here is fantastic. It even expands on ideas that never really got explored in HL2. 

Do know going in, it plays a lot more like a survival horror game crossed with a walking sim than the rest of Half Life; and the combine soldiers; while having a superb visual rework are kind of dumb as bricks.  

It does admittingly play it a little safe at points; the monster variety is good but limited; There's only 4 weapons, pacing is excellent but and it could be gone for a few more hours IMO.  

The No-VR mod is damn good for what it it's; yes, it is very janky and crashes at points, but the pure half-life experience is faithfully maintained. Immense credit to the Mod developers for giving many who cannot financially or medically afford to buy what is still just a piece of gimmick tech a chance to experience this game. It’s also super easy to install.

Half life alyx fails on all fronts, outshined by small teams of indie devs, features like, sprint, multiplayer, online, character models, toggle flash light, and other things were completely thrown out the window to make a visually appealing tech demo gaming journos. the game play itself is absolutely god awful, Pavlov got is right in 2017... half life alyx came out in 2020, a full 3 years later... there is literally no excuse for such god awful game play. that being said steam/gaben stans are no different from Nintendo adults. they will buy anything as long as there daddy's logo is on it... a nice continuation of story for die hard half life fans, but the game is not very fun or intutive in terms of its mechanics and game play... too much of a visual vertical slice tech demo than an actual half life game... half life games should bring a new sandbox, engine, and possibilities to the table, not this garbage tech demo they are charging 80 dollars full price for...",1665016499,1696017333,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

I've played like 2/3rds of Alyx on a friends HTC Vive (IIRC), so I know what Alyx is like in VR and It was great!!
But I cannot last longer for like 1 hour at  a time,  because the headset gets too stressful for my neck and it's mentally so much more demanding for me  than 'flatscreen'-games.

---NON-VR-PERFORMANCE
 -- WINDOWS

Then the No-VR-Mod came along (currently V0.9 installer). Under Windows 10 it works great on my RX 7600. The game is playable at HIGH and ULTRA setings at stable 60Hz (probably more but my TFT does not support more FPS).
The Mod turns Alyx in a most seemless NON-VR FPS game. Only issues I had were some minor input-recognition issues on game elements specifically designed for 3D manipulation. 

 -- LINUX
 - PROTON (non-native Linux version)
Under Linux (Ubuntu 23.04) manual installation of the MOD worked only partially for me (no 'Mouse Pointer'/  strange Pointer offset), so I just copied the game files from Windows over into my Linux Steam-library and it worked as expected.
But the performance under Linux is not so good, even with Vulkan. On WIndows 10 I got no problems running with HIGH Performance settings, under Linux I get some unstable 40 to 60 FPS in LOW settings and some more minor loading hiccups (no pop-ins).

- NATIVE LINUX VERSION
I don""t get the menu at the start of the game, so - no show I am afraid.

--- CONCLUSION
So, for all you without Headsets: You can safely enjoy Alyx in non-VR. It's still downright awesome.
Just download the installer and off you go!",1695402134,1695605647,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game had a lot of fun, really interesting reactions with objects in-game reacting to the world as you'd expect them to. Feeding the little alien rat and drawing phalluses on the whiteboard were pretty much my first indications that I was going to have a good time. Although this type of object reaction doesn't exist in the same amount of detail as the first 2 hours of the game, the times where it continued this trend were truly goofy.

The gunplay was really cool. Though it took a while to get used to as a first VR game, and I learned very early on that saves are your friend for when things go wrong (not very often I have to say this with shooters tbh). Each gun has its own upgrades and styles of reloading that you had to physically reload. It had a perfect balance of immersion and gameplay feel in those aspects. It felt like my ammo was considerably lower at the start of the game, but was then in abundance toward the end. Or maybe I just got better at the game honestly.

Not really into the whole Half-Life lore, the only game I really played extensively was HL-1. But even despite that, Rhys Darby in my ear as Russel made the whole thing a little more lighthearted juxtaposed against the entire world being taken over by the combine. The twist ending was also really good, and made even someone who doesn't care about the lore soyface at their little ending twist. Valve is very good at setting up cliffhanger endings and then never releasing a game afterwards, and they do that really well here too.

All in all though definitely recommend it, as a VR vet or someone who hasn't played VR before in their life. Game is well optimised, had little to no framerate issues, and one of the few games I tried in VR that didn't make me feel like throwing up.",1695346631,1695346631,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The only thing that is extremely upsetting is that there aren't more games of this calibur. It was well worth the investment IMO. I wanted to play this, I had a very outdated computer. I spent $3000 on a prebuilt Skytech prism and $400 on a quest 2. Best entertainment investment I have made.
The level of detail is so impressive. I spent many hours just looking around and appreciating the tiny details. I small can of bug spray, when you hold it to your face and read the tiny print, you can see the ingridients and warnings etc. Everything a real can would have.
The single most impressive thing is the physics. I put a spoon into a teacup. it stood up. i put another one on the other side and it also stood up. then i put both spoons on the same side and the cup tipped over. it sounds like an irrelevant thing, but it says so much about the realism in the physics.

I played using the NoVR mod by GB_2. 


The NoVR mod: This mod is good but it's not perfect and I did have problems. jumping over objects, movement wasn't fluid, mouse movement felt really bad (never felt accurate micro adjusting). opening doors/interacting with objects is kind of hit or miss, also picking up items to put into your invent had issues for me. It wouldn't put the item into the invent, then I noticed if I had 1 item in the invent sometimes it would pick up an item. idk.. Also you can out of bounds insanely easy. Crouch jump height is OP. maybe it's just for the mod though. It was fun to jump on everything, it felt like I was climbing a COD4 map.

Graphically beautiful, also the physics are incredible. shake up a soft drink bottle and watch the carbonation, does that really matter for gameplay? No, but it's cool to see a video game actually have that level of physics and laws that apply in game.

Story was great.

As of right now I have to say this is my favourite half life game I've ever played. They did great.

Seriously though, This is a must have for anyone with a vr headset. fuck beatsaber, fuck boneworks. buy this NOW. 

Half Life:Alyx remains the only triple A game completely developed for vr, and boy does it earn this title. Beautiful set pieces/environments, quirky dialogue, tense combat, great horror sections. It has something for everyone. And if you're a fan of the half life series, which you probably are (If you arent please still play this game! its not gatekeepy and will introduce you to a lot of stuff! sadly the ending might not be as impactful, as this is a prequel for hl2, Id still hope you would have fun with this game!) This game FUCKS. 

Combat in this game is truely a highlight, as I found myself diving for cover and hiding while bullets whizzed over my head. the weapons compliment this, having unique upgrades and each serving their own purpose. I played this game on hard and let me tell you a couple of encounters really gave me a run for my money, but prevailing felt sooo soo good

Puzzles are also a highlight. the multitool ones in particular are great. theres also an entire puzzle chapter which is super fun and I loved every second of it (chapt 7 for those who knows). Some cool physics puzzles which are a half life classic, and the russles made everything feel so good to interact with. 

Speaking of russles, the gravity gun replacement in this game is downright ADDICTIVE. Flicking everything towards me and catching it just never got old. the downside is that you cant kill with objects anymore, but thats completely fine! I think the russles have enough positives to outweigh the negatives!

The graphics are nothing short of breathtaking. The level of detail in the environments is astounding, making City 17 feel alive and lived-in. The sound design complements the visuals perfectly, further enhancing the immersion.

I didn't agree with every creative decision that Valve took with this game, but overall I'm super happy to see Half Life return and I can't wait for newer games in the series.
The gameplay was amazing. All of it is incredibly fun and has Valve's characteristic high level of quality when it comes to level design, puzzles, enemy design. Having to actually manually reload guns and throw grenades adds a unique feel to the game that makes even headcrabs and zombies a legitimate challenge. The Combine especially are a much bigger challenge and have some of the most realistic behavior and tactics I've seen - they really feel like you're fighting actual soldiers. Jeff was a fantastic horror segment, truly a proud successor to Ravenholm. I just love the whole ""fungal zombies"" idea, so getting some of that in Half Life is just *chef's kiss.*
The story overall was great, it fit well into the HL storyline. As for the ending, [spoiler]at first I was a bit upset about Gman just changing the established timeline so Eli survives, I'm honestly not a fan of that trope. But honestly, the ending doesn't really show anything the Gman hasn't already been shown or implied to be capable of. [/spoiler]
The atmosphere and creative design is where I have a few issues. Everything seems a lot flashier and over-engineered than in previous Half Life games: examples like how the Manhacks glow, all the little bitty moving parts in the Combine charging stations, how a lot of characters have more over the top, exaggerated mannerisms, little stuff like that. Almost feels a bit more like Dishonored - it's not a bad aesthetic at all but I think in the future Valve should steer more towards the Half Life 2 monolithic aespects of the Combine. Not all of it is bad of course; at first I didn't like the new Combine designs but they've really grown on me. Also the humor, to be honest I think some of the humor was overdone, especially for a universe as dark as Half Life. Again, this is all nitpicking, the game still has tons of great charm and excellent little details that I truly appreciate. I think one thing that sort of threw me off was the Source 2 engine; I'm so used to Source 1 that the game almost looked not surreal enough for me lmao - this is just something I'll need to get used to, not a fault of the game at all, and the game is absolutely GORGEOUS, especially at dawn, this game is stunningly beautiful.
The soundtrack, to be honest, I was disappointed by. There were some great tracks, the track for the final Strider battle and the ending credits music were fantastic and fit perfectly. But other than that, the soundtrack was pretty generic, it seemed like something more out of Doom and Hollywood than Half Life 2's pretty distinctive sound.
Overall, I give Half Life: Alyx an 80/100. I'm so, so happy that we got a new Half Life game after all these years, and I can't wait to see what the future of my favorite franchise holds. It's clear that regardless of some aspects of HLA I didn't really like, there's a ton of love and hard work in this game and I appreciate every bit of it.

Before Alyx I only played HL2 and the episodes on X360.

I'm doing a replay now and am still as much blown away by this title as when I first bought it. I now live in a larger apartment and have a lot more freedom of movement which makes the game so much more immersive. With Air Link you can play the game untethered which makes the experience even more powerful.

It has some of the best gunplay in VR, some amazing hacking puzzles that are actually fun, and a variety of different levels both in terms of gameplay as well as atmosphere. Stumbling in the dark through the sewers infested with headcrabs and zombies is absolutely chilling, a great way to learn how to handle weapons (you have to reload manually) before diving into shoot-outs with the Combine.

An absolute achievement in VR gaming and VR storytelling and a landmark few have come close to surpassing even 3 years later. The combat, the enemies and the environments are all superb. Combat is not as fast as the two previous entries in the series but it makes up for that with much more tactical and methodical gameplay, where every shot matters and positioning is key. 

It's not a perfect experience though, and all my issues come from the fact Valve were afraid not to scare any newcomers off of VR. We lack sprinting, instead of that we can teleport for faster movement, which surprisingly works well. The teleport ability also replaces jumping, but that does not work nearly as nicely as it did for sprinting. 

The arsenal is also very limited as we have only 3 weapons this time. And again in fear of scaring off newcomers we don't have any two handed weapons and no melee combat. None of these issues are deal-breakers since the game is build around all this in mind. The ability to upgrade guns also goes a long way to make up for the limited arsenal.
I do wish they updated the game to add more movement options now that the game has been out for a few years. 

The only real problem with Half-Life Alyx is valve's insistence on not releasing a proper SDK for the game to allow modders to go wild. As we speak there are quite a few good mods and maps, but we won't be seeing a real explosion in modding until something is done about an SDK or better modding tools. 

Anyway in summary Half-Life Alyx may have issues, some in game and some out of it, but it is still unrivaled in the VR space, and absolute 10/10 experience and a must play spinoff/sequel to the Half-Life series.",1693934971,1693934971,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

VR exposes both limits and opportunities. I.e. a true 3d experience but tethered to a headset. In this context,  HL:A's VR gameplay mechanics have clearly been well thought through in order to maximise the opportunities and to negate the limits where possible.

half life alyx is a game that ive known of its existence for quite a while, but ive never really thought about playing it because ive never played any other half life games. but then one day i was looking for VR games to play on steam and i remembered i got alyx for free when i bought my valve index. so i thought ""eh, i'll give a try at least""
and i am so glad i did, because this game blew my expectations out of the water. its a really well made linear VR shooter where you traverse through the game, fighting a variety of enemies as you progress, as well as occasionally solving the odd puzzle. one of the things i like about the game was how theres a ton of things you can interact with throughout the game world. theres junk on shelves your can mess with, paintings on walls you can move around and take off the walls, knobs on sinks and tubs you can twist, ECT. sure none of these things are essential to the gameplay, but they really help with the immersion and makes it feel more like a real world. i wish more vr games did this. the game has a large variety of environments you encounter throughout your playthrough. from futuristic alien buildings, to dark dingy sewers, to overgrown abandoned houses, and more. the game has an impressive runtime, having the average casual playthrough being around 10-12 hours, which probably still isnt enough for me to consider it worth its price tag, but i got it for free so screw it.
the game also has these ""gravity gloves"" which are really intuitive from a VR standpoint. now most vr games can be a bit of a pain to have to bend over or crouch down to pick up everything, some games fix this by letting you ""force grab"" objects from a certain distance, but the gravity gloves not only solved this problem, they made it fun. you can latch onto any object from pretty much any distance, and flick your wrist to fling it right into your hand. this is done in a way that feels very natural, and enjoyable to do.
combat is pretty well done. theres a variety of enemies that you encounter, but they all require different tactics to fight. some enemies can be killed instantly if you shoot them in a very specific spot, some require to be shot in certain parts in a certain order to kill, and some you can feed explosives to for an explosive death. you have 3 weapons, a pistol, shotgun, and smg. theyre all very well balanced and you never feel like you overuse one, or one gets left out. youre also given grenades, health injectors, and explosive barrels you can shoot.
the story is pretty well done, even as someone who has never played half life before i could still understand the story perfectly fine. i think they wanted to make the game newcomer-friendly so even though they relied on pre-existing story beats from the previous games, but they still explained it for players who dont know or remember it. it had some colorful characters, both likeable and comedic, and the storyline has twists and turns that keeps you wanting to know what will happen next
overall its a great game to play if you have a VR headset. if you got it with your valve index give it a try, but if not maybe wait for a sale if youre going to buy",1693783258,1693783258,True,0,0,0,0,True,True,False

I purchased this (Half-Life: Alyx  for $1000 and got the Valve Index VR headset/ base stations and hand controls free.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  NOTHING is ""FREE"".

Now that I got that off my chest...hahaha.  

I'm sort of new to gaming and loved it passively throughout my life.  Always wondered about VR and finally jumped in the game and loving it.  

Many gamers I'm sure have tough skins and very seasoned to take everything gaming has to offer.

Well, I tell ya, I was totally unpressed on this Half-Life: Alyx ""game"".  One thing that got me on this title was that fact it was solely made for VR.  How can that be?  Well, once I set up my system and was ready to go, I fell right into playing this game with both feet in the water and never turning back.  Albeit, I do take many breaks...haha.

You can almost smell the air as you're playing.  You can almost feel the presence of ""whatever is lurking"".  For me, being weak at heart..HAHA....it's hair raising even to the point at times I have to take off the headset, tell myself it's only a game, put the headset back on and only find myself taking it off again!  The sound track is enough for me to pull off the headset.  HAHAHAHAHAA

This game is an adventure loaded with horror as well as “break time” where you can explore the area if you want.  Even after “killing” your threat(s), there is time to explore and oh man, the DETAIL.  I found myself rearranging the boxes on shelves at times...HAAAAAA

Running your fingers over the screened windows and along the old cast iron heaters brings even more life and realisim to this game as there are details way beyond I could even imagine.  There were/are times where I forget where I am and actually wave the dust from the front of my face only to realized it's all VR.  HOLY COW! Talk about DETAIL!

The lighting is superbly done to where even in low lighted areas, you can see a light source which subtly illuminate surrounding objects even at the correct angles.  In the trains,  similar lighting is so realistic. 

Only thing I found so far, is the writers/programmers could have made a similar lighting effect for Alyx.  She has no shadow whatsoever.

I finally found this as I wondered around in the plaza to the Northern Star.  The ""sun"" was casting shadows all over the place, so Alyx turns around, looks down, and ""NO SHADOW"".    Not a deal breaker by all means, but it would have added an extra layer of realism.  

Even Friends were amazed at the relistice and detailed graphics within the game.  During my “downtime” within a segment, inside or out, I would take them on a “tour” of that portion on the game.  I had to hold their hands while the spun around...Hahaha

Overall, if you like this kind of game...THIS is the game.  (like I should know what other games do...hahaha).  I found the comments about the game to be true and spot on.  Even though I have nothing to compare this game to, I would comfortably say, this is the BEST so far. 


This game was already 3 years old at the time I started playing it, I would only imagine VR will be the way to go for certain things of course.  Can't wait to finish this one and start it all over as well as delve into other titles and genres.  

Thanks for reading.
Cheers.

[u]FIRST OF ALL: ACCESSIBILITY![/u]
(because i dont see a lot of steam reviews mention it, on any game.)

[list]
[*]game difficulty can be adjusted, whether you want to play easy due to accessibility, or if you still want a bit of a challenge even if youre bad at games! 
[*]captions work great, along with great voice acting that's clear and audible. 
[*]lots of movement required. this is either an upside or downside, depending on how your body is about gettin some exercise. personally made me very achy, very fast, but thats due to my specific chronic pain issues so take it with a grain of salt
[*]big modding community so if you need somethin you can probably find a mod for it somewhere. 
[*]easy-to-learn controls, but may cause issues for those with motor skills/hand-eye coordination problems. still generally do-able though! 
[*]THE GAME CAN BE LOUD!! because theres guns explosions etc. but overall more accessible audio-wise than any other half-life game! (and most first person shooters in general, tbh)
[*]contains various common emotional and sensory triggers (blood/gore, body horror, aliens, loud audio and sudden noises, along with flashing) while none of this is new for the half-life franchise, i think its especially important to mention due to it being a VR title. stay safe, and err on the side of caution if any of this may cause you serious medical issues!

[u]OVERALL REVIEW[/u]

quite literally the most beautiful game i've ever played. in so many ways.

in the time that it took me to finish the game over years (due to inconsistent access to vr hardware) it was always so easy to get back into it after being away for a long time. after becoming unable to properly play in the way i used to, i did NOT let that stop me from seeing the absolute gorgeous entry via watching a playthrough on youtube. while it's possible to play without vr with mods, or just watch it online, i guarantee you that they DID go to the absolute fullest when selecting virtual reality as a medium. its genuinely the best vr experience, maybe even game as a whole, known to humanity. without exaggeration. and while its enjoyable in any format you consume it in, i highly encourage use of VR equipment to play this yourself.

after seeing the ending, i woke up the next day back to being obsessed with half life like i was years ago. and now im dead set on adjusting my setup to allow me to play with vr controllers even with my disability and limited hardware from my bed. im not kidding when i say that this game is so beautiful that im finding workarounds for getting it to work on a gaming laptop with outdated hardware just so i can play it again with my disability. 

level design is intuitive, clear, and gorgeous. graphics are gorgeous. overall visual design is gorgeous. game ran great for me, with little to no framerate dropping. lots of fun with both central game mechanics AND story. heart wrenching writing that made me want to throw up from getting emotional about it. easy-to-learn gameplay that never takes long to pick up, no matter how long youve been gone.

my criticisms: jeff scared me. but seriously, the only thing i have is more of a warning that applies to vr in general. take breaks!! 1-2 hour gameplay sessions with 15 min breaks worked best for me. any longer than that and i ended up achy, nauseous, and disoriented due to the heavy action and movement present within the semi-frequent combat areas.

Valve has done the impossible by delivering an experience that not only lives up to the storied legacy of the Half-Life series but also sets an unprecedented standard for VR gaming as a whole. From the moment I put on the headset, I was transported into a world that felt so real, so engaging, and so utterly captivating that it's hard to put into words.

The attention to detail in Half-Life: Alyx is nothing short of awe-inspiring. Every corner of the game world is meticulously crafted, immersing you in a post-apocalyptic City 17 that oozes atmosphere and authenticity. The visual fidelity is breathtaking, with lifelike textures, intricate environmental design, and lighting effects that make you forget you're in a virtual space. Valve's Source 2 engine is a true marvel, and it's clear that the developers have pushed it to its limits to create an experience that pushes the boundaries of what VR can achieve.

Gameplay-wise, Half-Life: Alyx raises the bar for VR interactions. The game brilliantly leverages the immersive capabilities of virtual reality to make every action feel natural and intuitive. Picking up objects, solving puzzles, reloading weapons – it all feels incredibly satisfying. The physics-based interactions make the world feel tangible, and the level of interactivity is unmatched. Even after hours of gameplay, I found myself constantly amazed by the sheer depth of the mechanics and how well they integrate into the narrative.

Speaking of the narrative, Half-Life: Alyx delivers a gripping story that fills in the gaps between Half-Life and Half-Life 2. Players assume the role of Alyx Vance, a beloved character in the series, as she fights against the oppressive Combine forces. The writing is top-notch, filled with the kind of storytelling and character development that the Half-Life series is known for. The pacing is impeccable, seamlessly blending action-packed moments with quieter, more atmospheric segments that allow you to soak in the world around you.

One of the standout features of Half-Life: Alyx is its innovative use of VR to create tension and immersion in ways that traditional gaming cannot. The suspense of creeping through dark corridors, the rush of frantically defending yourself against enemies, and the heart-pounding encounters with terrifying creatures – all of these are heightened by the VR medium. The game's sound design and spatial audio play a crucial role in this, allowing you to hear enemies approaching from all directions and creating an uncanny sense of presence.

Valve has also shown a commitment to accessibility with Half-Life: Alyx. They've included a variety of comfort options that cater to players with different levels of VR experience, ensuring that everyone can enjoy the game without feeling overwhelmed or nauseous.

In conclusion, Half-Life: Alyx is a monumental achievement in gaming, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in virtual reality. Valve has not only delivered a worthy addition to the Half-Life series but has also set a new gold standard for VR game development. If you own a VR headset, playing Half-Life: Alyx is an absolute must. It's an experience that will stay with you long after you've put down the headset – a testament to the power of immersive storytelling and groundbreaking gameplay.

Pros:

Stunning visual fidelity and attention to detail
Innovative and intuitive VR interactions
Gripping narrative that expands the Half-Life universe
Tense and immersive gameplay unique to the VR medium
Thoughtful accessibility options for all players
Cons:

Requires a VR headset, limiting accessibility for some gamers
Verdict: Half-Life: Alyx is a true masterpiece that sets a new standard for virtual reality gaming. Valve has outdone themselves, creating an experience that's not only a must-play for Half-Life fans but a showcase of the incredible potential of VR as a storytelling and gameplay medium.

The grip input on the index controllers are absolutely phenomenal. Tossing grenades, healing, shooting, hiding, crouching, surviving! The story was great; and absolute half life experience.

While many are hopelessly waiting for valve to be able to count to 3 one day, they surprised everyone by making this stunning VR adventure/FPS in the half life universe. No Gordon Freeman in sight, but Alyx is just as good.

Built from the ground up for VR, and only playable on VR, it is a true masterpiece. The graphics are absolutely stunning. I have the luck to have a system that can run this on ultra highest settings and it is incredible. The details, not only in textures, models, but also the maps themselves, are a joy to behold.

The game guides you very nicely through the entire story. And yes, it is very very linear. You don't have many points that let you stray far from the given path, and sometimes that feels a little like a missed opportunity. Some extra rooms, corridors etc on the side would have been nice.

Cans, books, etc,  moves as you tough them. Although not everything is 'touchable' like in bonelabs/boneworks, they found a very good balance.

The biggest 'flaw' I see in this masterpiece, is that the 3 or so guns are not held on your person. And it is a dial menu that lets you select them. This is the only immersion breaking point. I would have liked to see some holsters on your person instead.

But aside that, I can completely recommend this game.

The story is told through complex set building and quippy dialogue. Within the first few minutes, I was blown away; that new Valve intro, the massive Striders, the sprawling back alleys of City 17, the first elevator Combine scene, and the first Headcrab scene.

Even with my cheaper, inaccurate Windows Mixed Reality set, I was still able to fully enjoy the experience. Source 2's graphical fidelity, art direction, sound design, and physics are the best in all of VR.

The price being a triple-A $60 is worth it, but consider waiting a sale when it is considerably discounted. However, being a VR experience, it is no replacement for a full ""Half-Life 3"" PC experience. But being one of the first of its kind, this is the best VR experience you can have right now.

The main issues of the game that I had were fixed extremely quickly after launch. The addition of snap turning and Steam Workshop, and the removal of the disappearing hand bug gave me an impression of Valve's professionalism.

Compared to HL1's nine guns (excluding crowbar and ordinances) and HL2's seven, Alyx simplifies to just three guns, and though I felt it was very inadequate, it was necessary for our current generation of primitive motion controllers. My only big complaint is the lack of the classic Quake-like PvP deathmatch--a mainstay of past titles.

All in all, it was worth it to get a glimpse at the future of gaming, as well as the power of Source 2. Now we just sit and wait for the next big Valve title.

Edit: The next big Valve title is Counter-Strike 2



An Addendum For Us Nerds
2015's Source 2 is not an impressive engine by today's standards. However, some of the effective and innovative, VR-optimized techniques used are:
- PBR textures
- Parallax-corrected cubemaps
- Static-to-dynamic shadow transitions
- Smooth enemy locomotion animations
- Dynamic glass breaking
- Rubikon physics engine
- Fluid shader for bottled beverages
CS2 will add a life-like and robust water caustics shader to the engine.",1584989052,1691700519,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Usually I try to wait until I complete the initial stories of singleplayer games but I have rare exceptions. This game is amazing. 

The physics are next level in this game, nearly every object can be interacted with, objects have collision with your guns and such. It's so immersive. It's horror fairly horrific in some sections which take place in dark places where you need to use external lightsources to see. The gunplay is fun but not over the top. It's very basic, you just aim, shoot, press a button to remove mag and load the clip it, then slide the slide back to chamber a round. It's that simple but each gun has different mechanics for reloading that are easy and fluent to do. 

The story is the real outlier because it is just.. valve goodness. It is so good and well paced. Do I recommend this game?

That's why it's so disappointing that I have to write this negative review. The game doesn't have an optional walking movement system, forcing plays into archaic jumping movements. This is great for those new to VR, but very limiting to those who are experienced. 

The worst offence this game has to offer is it's horrible optimization. Any time there is a large area loaded, the game comes to a screeching, 10 fps halt. The only fix for this is to load your save. However, half the time you do this, the game will completely freeze in the loading screen. My right lens flickers on and off for the 5 minutes it's loading, and then the game either crashes and then freezes your computer, or finally loads you back into the game, completely stable(for now).  This is not hardware dependent, as I've had this problem on my computer since release. I met the minimum specs then, and more than surpass them now, but the issue remains. 

This is an amazing game that sets the industry standard for VR, but hasn't gotten the TLC it's needed since release to polish out the serious flaws it has. The story is great, the characters are well written, the gunplay is engaging, and the world is fun to explore. It's terribly saddening that the game is nearly unplayable in the second half, because that's where the game shines most.",1606344188,1691457193,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

And guess what, in the main menu: you cant change preferences, so the actual changes i wanted to make are now impossible. GJ valve, 3 years later and ya didnt learn shid.

edit: 
Anyway, I have found one workaround for now, which is to go to Program Files\Streaming Assistant\driver\bin\win64\RVRPlugin.ini and change controllertype=3 to controllertype=1. This makes the Pico software ""emulate""/pretend the controllers to be Rift CV1 controllers (as opposed to Pico/Quest 2 controllers by default).

I think some SteamVR games can't quite handle newer generic controllers yet, so this fallback is a workaround.

Half-Life: Alyx is, even 3 years after its release, one of the best VR games out there. It is clear that the developers went all out on this game. The story, the mechanics, the environment, the interactions, puzzles and hidden secrets make the game feel very alive.

I would consider the game more an adventure rather than a FPS. The game houses 3 different guns you can upgrade as the play the story. Unfortunatly the game has no melee wepons for you to use. Besides weapons and grenades you are equiped with a set of Gravity-Gloves, a special set of gloves that allows you to pull in items from around you. While the gloves are not as obviously usefull like a gun, they can be used in a lot of creative ways to help you, both in and out of combat.

The movent the game offers are both locomotion and teleport. Crouching is done by, well, crouching. Jumping is however, not part of the game. 

The story takes place in a city you won't travel far in. Map wise is seems like a short walk but the levels are plentyfull. On the streets,  though the building, metrostations and even further underground you will face many different environments on a play-through. The story is intense and well-paced. Everywhere you find silly humors and funny achievment challenges. 

Half-Life: Alyx is a must play for those who have a VR set. And when you do get to play the game, say hi to Jeff for me.

Especially if you are a half life fan, seeing Half Life with 2020 graphics and technology is amazing.
This game has an incredible amount of detail put into it, its like if Rockstar Games made a VR game

This game has gave me more immersion than other VR game our there apart from probably Boneworks. Its so damn realistic its the only game where I played for 1.5 hours straight",1634432468,1691263388,True,0,1,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False

As a fan of the Half-Life series, stepping into Alyx's shoes was a dream come true. The attention to detail, immersive environments, and seamless gameplay mechanics left me awestruck from start to finish.

The game's narrative is gripping and seamlessly fits into the Half-Life universe, providing new insights and depth to the story. The puzzles are ingeniously designed, making use of VR to challenge both your wits and reflexes. Each encounter with enemies feels intense and strategic, pushing the boundaries of what VR gaming can achieve.

Graphically, Half-Life: Alyx is a showcase of VR capabilities. The level of realism in the world, from the smallest objects to the grandest vistas, is jaw-dropping. The sound design further enhances the immersion, with every creak and whisper adding to the suspenseful atmosphere.

Valve has truly outdone themselves with Half-Life: Alyx. It's a game that demands to be experienced by any VR enthusiast and a must-play for Half-Life fans. This is not just a game; it's a landmark achievement that sets a new standard for VR gaming. Kudos to Valve for delivering an unforgettable journey that will have you craving more.

There is nothing quite like actually using your hands to physically block a headcrab from attacking you, or actually hiding behind cover or bending down to avoid gunfire from Combine Soldiers. The ending was *really* unexpected. Not gonna say what just because it's (very obviously) spoilers for the game, although the game *has* been out for the past 3 years. The fact that this game also has Source 2 Film Maker, Hammer and other Source engine development tools along with a workshop that allows people to add simple maps, model replacements (or even new models for use in S2FM) is amazing. Valve really tried when making this game. Genuinely, if you have the money and a VR, try this game. Or even if you just have the money! someone made a NoVR mod for this game so you don't need one! Although, it does *really* remove the fun from the game. short version of this review: fun game, headcrabs are silly, 10/10!

One thing I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, did-didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside and even though I tried
It all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when-
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try

To remind myself how I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside and even though I tried
It all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when-
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

But it's over-hyped. For the first half an hour it's impressive, but after that it plays just like any other shooter - not something I expected from VR. 
Shooting with your hands in games is an old idea. As they say, ""Everything new is well-forgotten old"".

'90 arcade machines had physical guns, for 2 players. NES/Famicom, PlayStation 1 had lightgun games. Time Crisis is one of the good examples. Not only is it the same principle, but it's also cheaper and better. Instead of using this expensive helmet and clunky controllers to shoot a gun with shaking hands, you get an actual physical gun to shoot things from the screen (you might buy the big screen). And it's feels great.

You can make it so on PC through emulators, by the way.
So why all the fuss with VR? Just make a new Valve lightgun, which will be accessible to many people because it's a very simple (cheap to produce) device, and revive the genre of lightgun shooters.",1689967749,1690966321,True,1,0,0.415391325950622559,0,True,False,False

Much like with Half Life 2, it feels like Valve have really invested the time (and considerable expense) to push the boundaries to see what could be accomplished with cutting edge technology.

The journey from start to finish took around 18 hours for me, although better players may be able to get through it in a few hours less. 

My one criticism isn't really a critique, but the horror sections are incredibly tense and utterly terrifying. This is a testament to how good Valve were at implementing them, but also it was too much for me personally as I don't have the stomach for stuff like that.

This is a game that really requires it; a game where you're constantly running (walking?) away from horrible creatures. A huge fu ckup. Not sure what the pathetic excuse was because it wasn't because it wasn't possible. Second, they put a flashlight on one hand and the gun on the other with no option of putting the light on the same hand as the gun or as an attachment to the gun itself, whatever so long as the light points to where I'm aiming. Again, WTF!? This was another huge blunder that has so far ruined the game for every place that requires a light. The light is a piece of crap too. One of those I'll point a narrow bright beam that leaves it completely dark outside the tiny diameter beam so I'm constantly pointing it frantically all over the place and when you move it the graphics are so awesome that the shadows in the light are annoying, constantly bouncing around with the frenetic searching. PUT THE LIGHT ON THE GUN!!! Idiots, seriously, how can they spend so much time and effort to create something so grand and to ruin it with stupid choices that make no sense. To completely eliminate basic controls and logical, possible options. Then there are the standard VR complaints that go with whatever system you have. I have a Rift and I can't alter the height of the ground, so my VR ground is always a foot or so below the real ground. Lucky Rift S and Quest owners have a simple option in the settings. Us that bought early and supported them first have been ignored and sh it on by oculus and meta for not buying a newer system. So I can't touch or open anything that's below my floor.

In the beginning of the game I thought of refunding it because it seemed like there would be zombies in it and I hate zombie games, after encountering my first enemy and seeing that it wasn't that scary I fell in love with the game. the game has parts that scare the crap out of me and parts that make me and my friend die laughing because I'm getting scared at nothing. 

I played it until I couldn't stand anymore (which was 6.9 hrs) This game will put you on an emotional roller coaster with meeting new enemies and having to find out the best way to kill them (Mostly the hard way) The zombies aren't even my fear in this game it's the little creatures that are attached to them or by themselves. Even though I played for 6.9 hrs I'm not even half way through the game. 

So far this game is amazing and I can't wait to finish it. And if you played it you'd feel the same.",1690842139,1690842139,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

For the game itself, it is wonderful for a Half-life fan to see the world again, the return to places like City 17 and seeing most iconic characters has made this such a wonderful callback. Excellent voice acting and a very interesting story, alongside a clear tease at how Valve might not have completely given up on the Half-life story and instead are cleverly attempting to rewrite it to fix dead-ends they'd made for themselves in the prior games.

the gravity gloves are a really good choice for the most important specific action the player preforms in the game because the average office or bedroom is of course not as large as the in game environments, so the gloves allow the player to interact with distant objects and pick things up without it being as tedious as in real life and breaking the pacing. additionally they perfectly fit into the half life universe thematically.

and even while making a soup of good game mechanics the devs didnt forget that the purpose of vr is immersion. so even though my janky computer cant handle the graphics without lagging out my quest 2 every 20 minutes i was still immersed in the beautiful environments because i find alien flesh growths beautiful. even if the game had no story and was just called explore abandoned buildings simulator ft. a hundred headcrabs i would still give it a good rating.

and that is because the story isnt the focus. its pretty simple and easy to follow on its own but in the context of having played half life 2 is probably a genius retcon type situation that solves the cliffhanger of episode 2 and creates a new one for the story of a new game to use. that being said i havent played half life 2 yet and i dont fully know how im meant to interpret the story even after watching an explanation video so i can write this review accurately.

the game doesnt have any outstanding drawbacks reducing its quality and the largest issue for me was the small amount of content and little replayability, but both of these issues can be fixed with mods which the game openly supports in the form of custom maps and addons.

so while i dont recommend spending $400 or so just to play this game (or any individual game), it is a must have for anybody that already has access to vr.

Servings:

Ingredients
1 teaspoon butter to grease pan

1 large egg

1/2 cup white sugar

6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

1/2 cup plain yogurt

1/2 cup milk

1/2 cup cornmeal

1 cup all-purpose flour

1 teaspoon salt

1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder

1/4 teaspoon baking soda

2 1/2 cups cornflakes, divided


Directions
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan generously with 1 teaspoon butter, and place a circle of parchment in the bottom. 

Whisk egg and sugar together in a bowl until light and fluffy, about 1 minute. Whisk in melted butter, yogurt, and milk until combined.

Add cornmeal, flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda to egg mixture; whisk until dry ingredients are moistened. Fold in 2 cups of the cornflakes with a spatula. Transfer batter to the prepared pan, and smooth the top.

Scatter remaining 1/2 cup cornflakes evenly over the top; press in lightly with your fingers.

Bake in the preheated oven until a skewer inserted near the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes.

Cool cake in the pan for 15 to 20 minutes before removing to a plate. Cool completely before serving with fresh fruit or a fruit sauce.

The story being rewritten in a short amount of time, resulting in something that's honestly very bland and could have been a lot better, the twist of it being Gman in the vault was the most obvious thing ever with no attempt to keep it a surprise, the ending being a retcon of Ep2's ending is really stupid. 
They also have a part where you watch the shadow of a lady from the cut story communicating with an Advisor, this gives the impression that she's going to be revealed later as some essential character to the plot but no, she has no relevance.

The Jeff area is cool but I personally felt it went on too long, it should have had some other segment in the middle to break it apart.
I also think Jeff has a garbage design, he just looks like a generic sc-fi humanoid monster thing, it would have been better if there was some connection to headcrab zombies incorporated in the design, something like the poison zombie from HL2 and the Gonome from Opposing Force.

The Antlion's suck, the way they walk looks stupid and the way you fight them makes you feel like your playing a rail shooter in an arcade and ruins your immersion, I'm not sure how they could have handled them but they didn't do it well.
The design of the Antlion worker also sucks, instead of using the superior design from Ep2 they went with something that mostly looks like a recolor of the normal Antlion.

Enemies are way too bullet spongy, it's insanely annoying, it takes so many head shots just to kill a grunt.

The lack of melee combat, not only that but you can't even damage enemies with props, not even head crabs, meaning if you run out of ammo you can't do anything.

I'm honestly not a fan of the arsenal, It's very small and you don't get to pick up the soldiers weapons which sucks.
I also get they wanted everything to be usable with one hand but I would have much preferred a pump shotgun.
I have astigmatism so my right eye is very blurry and makes it hard to aim since I'm right handed, so I tend to get the Laser Sight upgrade, the problem for me is that the same upgrades on different weapons are priced differently, so if I want the laser sight on the shotgun its the cheapest upgrade for only 10 resin, but on the pistol it's the most expensive for 35, kind of annoying.

Valve has really found a way to ease you into the controls and make them actually feel natural and fun to use. From the gunning down some Combine, to traversing a dank dark tunnel filled with dangers, you will always feel in control and able to deal with anything that comes your way.

The environments are top notch and always feel natural. With plenty of small nooks and crannies you will be well rewarded to do some searching in all the dark corners for resin, ammo, and the occasional med. Some of these items will just be sitting out in the open and others will be stashed away in lockers, chests, crates, and even corpses.

I got a VR headset, a 1st gen Vive, originally for trying out this new, unexplored territory of virtual reality gaming and what it could offer. I played a few games, all of which were really good in their own right but had their flaws... then I played Alyx. 

Alyx absolutely [i]ruined[/i] ruined VR games for me. Not because it's bad, but because it's so unbelievably f--king amazing. Alyx makes you feel totally connected to its environment through pretty much very small detail; how guns work, how characters in person interact with you, how you as the player interact with the environment through random things you can touch, puzzles, and how you have to actually throw stuff around off shelves and scavenge for supplies, how you have to traverse the world, and so much more. When you're behind a pillar taking pot shots at a large amount of combine, or trying to find ways to slow down zombies to buy yourself time to reload or scavenge, it really feels.like you're there doing these things. The world feels real which makes it all the more wild when the world starts breaking the rules of reality.

I don't want to spoil too much but, essentially, this game takes full advantage of its medium to deliver single handedly the best VR experience pretty much ever. And it's completely spoiled me. No other VR game comes close to being as engaging as Alyx does; not even 3+ years later. And it makes all the older VR games not fun to play because you just want to recapture that same feeling of awe, wonder, and engagement that Alyx provides.

You need to play it. You just have to. But be warned it'll ruin any other VR game for you.",1689962892,1689962892,True,0,0,0.474683523178100586,0,True,False,False

Pros:
[list]
[*] gameplay is dynamic, fluid and immersive
[*] story is great
[*] nostalgia hits where it should
[*] graphics are spot on
[*] Gman
[/list]

Cons:
[list]
[*] Alyx speaks, which kinda took me out of character (for once that we got a game where you really play as the character, it feels weird after 15 years of a silent Freeman)
[*] puzzles to opens chests don't feel rewarding and don't add any value. Half Life was about entire rooms of puzzle solving (ofc there are in the game as well and they feel great)
[*] would have loved a bigger arsenal, although I do understand that it would be hard to handle a big inventory in VR

In short, the hype is real and reviews are true. There is simply nothing on the market like Alyx. It is THE defining VR game. To the point where... think of your favorite 10/10 VR game... and realize Alyx is still way above that scale. You cannot rate it against other VR games. It's like being 3 years old at Disneyland. An untouchable, mesmerizing, unique experience. You believe you're in it. A smile creeps across your face as the Combine death sound plays, a life-sized Vortigaunt talks to you, and a [redacted] or a [redacted] or [REDACTED] is in your face. The immersion is so far above anything else and the storytelling and pace is classic Valve. I don't know why they're so frightened of public response to HL3 because Alyx proves they haven't lost a step.

It is nearly correct to say ""do not buy VR without buying Alyx"". You need it. It is what VR should've been and should continue to be (and evolve from).

The attention to detail and the level of realism achieved in the game is truly remarkable. From the stunning graphics to the intricately designed environments, every aspect of Half-Life: Alyx has been carefully crafted to create an unparalleled gaming experience.

One of the standout features of Half-Life: Alyx is its perfect blend of gameplay mechanics and storytelling. The game seamlessly combines elements of first-person shooting and puzzle-solving with a rich and engaging narrative, keeping players on the edge of their seats throughout the entire experience. The intense moments of gunfights are balanced with moments of exploration and discovery, creating a well-rounded gameplay experience that appeals to a wide range of players.

Moreover, the Gunman Contracts mod for Half-Life: Alyx adds an exciting twist to the already fantastic gameplay. This mod introduces a new level of challenge and strategy by incorporating contract-based missions into the game. Players are tasked with eliminating specific targets within a given time frame, requiring them to carefully plan their approach and make tactical decisions. The mod enhances the replayability of the game, offering new and unique experiences even after completing the main storyline.

In summary, Half-Life: Alyx is not only a technically impressive game but also a masterclass in storytelling and gameplay design. Its attention to detail, realistic visuals, and engaging mechanics make it an absolute must-play for any fan of the Half-Life series or virtual reality gaming in general.

The story was worth the price of admission. And I am glad I revisited it with my posterior planted firmly in front of a M&K playing a shooter, the way God intended it to be.

Gamers: Dear Valve, moar HL, plz. It has literally been years. We will give $$$.

Valve: How'bout a janky, narrow FOV scavenger hunt where you play as the gushy sidekick who wore tight bluejeans back in the early 2000s? Plus, it'll be on clunky, expensive hardware that only 5% of gamers can afford. Because PC Gaming! Gaben will sell you an Index.

Gamers: Ermmm...K, thanks? After all, UR gods.

Valve: Givin' the peeps what they want. Ahhhhhhh, yeah!

Modders (secretly): Non-VR challenge accepted. CU in 3-5 years.

And, yes, I knew what I was buying at the time. It just turned out to be marginally more entertaining to YouTube rather than to actually play with a visor strapped to my head. Plus, it really needed a melee weapon.

This is the most polished and detailed game I have every played. Everything is perfectly hand-crafted to add to the immersion and it truly shows the potential of VR for gaming. Every company should take this as a blueprint for how to make a proper VR experience (though of course it's not entirely necessary to match the ridiculous level of polish). Hopefully they follow up on this with another VR half-life game, because this was one of my favorite gaming experiences ever, and I want to see more games in this style, as well as the continuation to the story. 
There is one piece of criticism I want to give this game: It's a bit too easy. It throws healing items at you left and right, and it's almost impossible to run out of ammo if you pay attention to your surroundings.

I can't afford a new PC or a VR headset right now, so I decided to give the No VR mod a try, and since the game was heavily discounted I wouldn't suffer too much disappointment for the price. 

And it is actually pretty nice. Yes, the mod is still unfinished, but the world and the dialogues remain the same, it is still a Valve game. Gunplay is a bit weak and enemy AI is left as it was in VR version (pretty passive), but it is still a nice experience for the price (it was like 60% off here).

I've already seen the full walkthrough 3 years ago, so there's no bad feelings here that I experience this story this way. Feels like a walking simulator with a few puzzles and shootouts here and there. I will probably experience this in VR one day, but for now I can thoroughly recommend this No VR mod for Alyx.

But I wouldn't say it's as good as HL 1&2.

[u] Biggest cons in my opinion: [Spoiler] [/u]

[b] - Couple of weird/incomprehensible gameplay decisions. [/b]

[b] - The game is way too easy, spending time to collect resin is not absolutely necessary, because weapons are still strong enough without upgrades. [/b]

[b] - I am really disappointed about the finale, It wasn't as epic as I was hoping for, the battle against the strider was a joke - absolutely not challenging. [/b]

[b] - After around 15 years of complete radio silence about Half-Life, I've wished Valve would have risked something in terms of story. There is no storytelling about Alyx or her past, no storytelling about her family, no new storytelling about anything, just a tiny cliffhanger that is new at the end of the game. I have the feeling that Valve is so scared of the Half-Life franchise (fear of doing anything wrong), that they don't want to risk a bad new game (HL3) or risk something in the story that would create new problems. So HL:A feels like a not really necessary, squeezed in spin-off that brings no value to the story other than the last 30 seconds at the end of the game. [/b]

But in the end, a video game has to be fun, and this is what Half-Life: Alyx does great, like every other Half-Life game.

The story lives up to the quality you expect from Valve, with a similar storytelling style to the Half Life series, this feels right at home in the series. Valve really showcases the highlights of VR gameplay and the game feels very natural while also running surprisingly well. I was a bit worried my 1080 wasn't going to keep up but Valve's optimization had this game running great across all quality levels.

The highlight of the game is obviously the Northern Star Hotel. Jeff is a meme but in reality he stops being scary the instant you realise how he works, that you can never be killed by him except by some extreme incompetence, and then he feels like a chore. The bit in the lift was very cheap but also the last time you're ever going to be scared of him.

Otherwise, it's either bland or annoying. The game's controls are fucking awful and often contributed to death when an input just didn't work.

edit: I played for two more hours and I wish Reddit Russell would fucking shut up

This game does not fucking want you to play it. I've never seen a more insufferable opening in my life – you walk slowly through empty environments and set pieces while one of the most cretinous radio sidekick characters I've ever heard delivers lines that never fail to irritate. And he does not shut up. Alyx isn't really any better – almost every single line is some boilerplate snippy response. She's ingenuine. 

After an hour of pain, the game trusts you to be able to shoot enemies, and it turns into a very simplistic first person shooter. It seems designed for people who have never worn a VR headset before. Compare this to the VR mod for Half Life 2 and it's just insulting... where was I at this point in that game? Bashing those flying drone enemies with my crowbar in the sewer? Paying utmost attention to my surroundings because of the multiple types of threat that had been introduced at this point? Here it's walking forward slowly and shooting headcrabs with the pistol when they appear.

Eventually, I did find an encounter that posed some challenge; multiple headcrab zombies came after me in a fairly tight arena. Perfect time to load some bullets into the shotgun, so I press the button to open the shotgun up, grab some ammo from the shoulder, load it into the gun... Oh, not only did the ammo not grab but the gun inexplicably closed when I performed the loading action. I tried again two more times. Nope. Fourth time's the charm, but two shots isn't enough, so I went for a fifth attempt... nope. I threw the headset off as I heard the headcrab zombies chewing Alyx to bits. Good. It's what she deserves. Let's hear her try to be sarcastic when her head's been gnawed off. Stupid fucking bitch.

I've mentioned the character's slow walk a few times. For some reason, this game is designed with the expectation that you use teleporting. I despise this. I don't ever want to teleport in a VR game. By all means, include it for people who need it, but why gimp the player character's smooth walking speed so they have to use it? And why design the game without a normal jump? I want to feel some sort of immersion here, isn't that largely the point of VR? The moment you start warping around you might as well pull the headset off and play on the monitor because any illusion of being in a real place is gone. It surely wouldn't be difficult to give the player these options. Faster walking speed, a sprint and a jump. Maybe there's a mod that does this. I hope so.

I realise I'm only a couple hours in but it was disappointing enough that I brought myself to write this. It feels like the entire reason this game gets credit is because it's a big budget VR game. To be fair, it does look nice. I'm playing on a Pico 4 with dynamic res scaling turned off and 3000-something horizontal and vertical pixels per eye (via Virtual Desktop's Godlike mode) at 90FPS using an RTX 4080, streaming through the router. I'm beyond the point of being amazed by seeing depth in VR, sadly, so I wasn't walking around and poking my head into every surface, but I probably would have a few months back when I got the headset.

I'll continue to play the game but I have a feeling my opinion won't change... I feel as if the game has shown its intentions and probably will continue to be designed in this geriatric kind of way.",1688264550,1689049268,False,4,4,0.464668244123458862,0,True,False,False

If you have a Vr Headset, this game is a must have. I haven't played any of the Half-Life games but this makes me want to pick them up. The graphics are awesome, there's attention to detail on everything. Read newspapers or bottle labels you find around the place. Open every drawer, cabinet and box you see.

Guns are really satisfying to use. Aiming is difficult at first but with upgrades and experience it gets easier. Every. Bullet. Counts. You always go into a fight wondering if you have enough bullets and managing to get through by the skin of your teeth. 

This game takes every advantage of vr at every turn. So much innovation in one game. 

You'll run into some bugs, objects being flung into nothingness from explosives, hands get stuck behind something, minor clipping. Nothing crazy though, you can smash bottles against things and throw bombs all you want with no issues. My biggest issue throughout this whole game are ladders.

Across all VR platforms and the PC that exist as of right now, Valve managed to not only release a new installment 13 years after the last Half-Life title with a twist that re-wrote the end of Half-Life 2 Episode 2, but also combine everything I constantly miss about VR games - fluid gameplay in all actions with polished technical elements, all into one package.

I'm particularly fond of the Gravity Gloves, which are super quick to learn and super easy to use. It's not on a level like Half-Life 2's sandbox gameplay with it's Gravitron, but still allows for cool moves in the world. Sometimes foregrounded physical objects that you accidentally pull towards you can be the reason you get frustrated when using them, but those moments are pretty rare.
And speaking of physical objects: Every object in the world can be interacted with as you would expect in real life: Understandable, with weight, sometimes requiring two-handed actions. I found myself very often just playing around with rattling a box of matches near my ear to hear them moving in the box or just throwing and jiggling cardboard boxes around. It's a lot of fun.

The weapons serve their purpose in the world, although I would have liked to see a rudimentary melee weapon to knock down wooden slats or headcrabs, even though i can sort of understand why it is missing in the world because it can make inventory management a whole lot easier, taking away the situation Alyx is in. But a pipe you can smack something like 3 times with would've been cool nonetheless. What i dislike about the weapon selection is the pistol, which like in many VR games, takes the design of the 1911. We've had enough games that use this as a standard. Other than that, the game shifts the focus from the pistol being the main weapon to the SMG in the second half of the game with the shotgun being the weapon which is the most coolest out of them, but also the one barely used because of how few shotgun shells you find for it.
The multi-tool is cool and is also well incorporated into the game world.

The story is well-written and i liked to experience it while playing, although the connection to Half-Life 2 Episode 2 in this game makes me want to see another game in the franchise again. Normally, when people beg Valve for another Half-Life game, i often roll the eyes, but now Valve brought it up to themselves with the ending. Characters in the world are also very well designed, have amazing voice actors and body motion within the world, with the exception of Alyx' voice. Russell is normally a character i'd despise of in real life, but through the conversations i had with him, i started to like him more and more. The conversations with Eli are often only ""I miss you baby"" and ""I can't believe it"". A little bit uncanny is the Vortigaunt's mouth when speaking, since i was so used to the design in Half-Life 2.

The game world is very well designed and fun to move around in, with the only thing in it that i can't understand being the existence and placement of resin balls which are used for weapon upgrades, or the fact that there is always ammunition scattered around and on some people and ONLY the ones YOU need, which makes the feel of the world a little bit out of place. SMG rounds being found somewhere is fine, since it's a weapon actually used by someone else than you, but finding shotgun shells and pistol magazines when seemingly no one else has a weapon like it doesn't make a lot of sense to me.

But even with little logical mistakes or irritating design choices - at least in my eyes - the game is a must-have for everyone who owns a capable PC and a VR headset. The community-made campaigns, especially Levitation, are also incredibly well-made, making them the big cherry on top of your dessert. And especially in a sale for about 24 euros, which is a bit more than Blade & Sorcery or Pavlov VR outside a sale, it's totally worth it. You can also use the NoVR mod if you don't own a VR headset, in that case tho except a lot less of the impressions that VR players normally have with Half-Life Alyx.",1688772748,1688826045,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Game play is great too. It's sort of a post-apocalyptic dystopian/zombie/alien theme. They packed a lot of genres in there, but it works. Combat is good.

This was an absolute blast, played with the NoVR mod by the GB_2 team, and it worked well enough, but has issues currently.
I might be in a minority of HL fans but personally I wasn't a fan of the Episodes 1&2, they were a bunch of wheel spinning ending in sour cliffhangers, I always just feel like replaying HL2 and then ignoring the Episodes over the last two decades. Alyx, and the plot developments it has, it's own cliffhanger, redeems those episodes for me, and I really really wish Valve won't just again stop development for another two decades before we see the next entry.

Even outside of VR, I think Alyx is a great game.
What the modders trying to translate Alyx VR into NOVR need to understand is that Alyx is a lot more Survival Horror mechanically than just vanilla Half-Life FPS, stop trying to force Alyx into the mold of HL1/2 and instead look at Amnesia/RE.
All the weapon upgrades and much more intense scavenging, the way enemy encounters, AI and combat environments are set out, your puzzles and environmental interactions.
If the modders would just copy the homework of Resident Evil 7/8 & Amnesia/SOMA in how you interact with objects/environments, how you move and aim and shoot, inventory system and HUD implementations, then I feel like Alyx would have been perfectly translated to a normal flatscreen experience without losing its core identity.

As it stands, Alyx with the current versions of NOVR mods are incomplete experiences less because of what lofty ""immersion"" is lost from VR but more because they are simply put unfinished:
-Half of weapon upgrades are straight up disabled because modders couldn't implement them mechanically or visually.
-Environmental interactions are buggy and limited (hitting ""E"" doesn't even always register, can't interact with all objects, only vanilla HL2 style interaction)
-Puzzles are downright missing and ""autocompleted"" when you interact with them (This can result in confusion with progression, as you aren't following power lines but wondering what on earth you now need to go and interact with, you can easily sequence break/softlock this way)
-Sprinting is half-baked (if it took a page from RE, you'd have faster sprinting but no shooting, and normal movement with shooting but inaccurate, instead current sprint is barely faster than normal speed which is also surprisingly low)
-Jumping is required for normal traversal as you collide with incidental debris, jumping puzzles are half-baked as you can't pinpoint jump easily or collide with ceilings-- You WILL need noclip still in some places.

Still, with the frustrating limitations of the current NoVR mods and their direction, I still really enjoyed my time with HL Alyx.

The story, without going into spoilers, is just in my opinion something HL needed after all this time to revitalize that spark, to add a twist to the plot developments we've seen, and the execution of those developments, even without fancy VR, still were powerful.
The gameplay, I envision would be really, really fun, if it just handled better, and I can see that ideal flatscreen translation in my mind, where Alyx controls more like Ethan Winters in RE7/8, she can sprint fast, but needs to slow down or ideally stop to get proper accurate aiming with her pistol/SMG/shotgun, and thus getting the lasersight upgrades, the reflex sight upgrades, would feel impactful, they'd help and be meaningful improvements to aiming like they would literally in RE games (see lasersight literally in RE4R). Alyx's ""wristpockets"" would be a smaller but still important inventory system that you'd need to manage, and if you'd adapt the weapon wheel of VR into noVR, you could add to the UI the wrist pocket slots from where you could then pull the items you'd have (currently in noVR by BG_2 you can only store 2 health syringes, no grenade tradeoff, no random items like for Russell the vodka bottle - & weapon selection is the crude HL1/2 method of cycling, then clicking to confirm, why??? You only have a pistol, shotgun, SMG, just cycle through those without a need to click!).

Even in a flatscreen noVR experience, just walking in the environments was really entrancing, because they had to put effort in to making it all look and feel immersive in VR, it is bound to spill over to a noVR experience as well, not many regular FPS games where entering a boring room with some shelves and a desk and a corpse will have you just turning the place upside down interacting with everything before moving on, it still is fun to look at the highly detailed props and decals and vistas, and exploration, scavenging is just as fun, to find the right angle to look at something to see the obscured little loot, resin, ammo, whatever, just rewarding you constantly for observation.
The mood, atmosphere, with environmental sounds and the music, the effects, the improved lighting and materials, just standing in a place listening and watching feels pretty great.
It all holds up really well on zooming in and such, City 17 has never looked more impressive, and I just really liked the Quarantine Zone as a place, something that was kind of missing from HL2, a place that still is kind of a no-man's-land of xen infestation and combine trying to clear it out but half-heartedly. Shame no sonic doggos or bullsquids still didn't make a comeback. 

Combat, is funnily enough almost better than HL2, it has more to do with the fact that current HL2 is broken, Valve in their infinite wisdom while ""upgrading"" the Source engine over the years broke many features that were present on release in 2004, lots of visual touches, and gameplay ones like enemies used to twitch from every singe bullet shot, but after the 2009 & 2013 updates a lot broke, and Valve haven't bothered to fix anything except a handful of tiny things in 2019/20 when they made HL2 work on the Deck.
Alyx you have a lot of fun enemy animations, staggers, twitches, flinches, stuns, limping, their death ragdoll reminds me of FEAR, mixing animations blending into a ragdoll. So even with a limited arsenal of a pistol, SMG, shotgun & grenades, still, they felt a lot better than their counterparts in HL2.

Performance was rock-solid, even with only 4GB VRAM, a laptop with an i5-11400H, 3050RTX & 16GBRAM it ran capped 60fps on Ultra settings minus texture resolution on 1024 which still looked surprisingly decent even on closeups. You can modify stuff with commands easily, like the bloom effect was a bit too strong so I disabled it with r_post_bloom. 
Honestly kind of impressive how well it ran while looking gorgeous, but you do see some limits, aggressive culling, shadows that rematerialize when you look around, LODding even rather close, but nothing super distracting.

I wish Valve would make the game even more open to modding, if that would help at least a bit with stuff like making a noVR mod faster more feature-complete.
Or just make the noVR patch/addon themselves, just take a few pages from Amnesia/RE Valve, you already technically did in the game itself.

Alyx & Entropy Zero 2 made me crave for so much more HL stuff, Valve, get on it (& fix HL2 already, preserve 2004 legacy features like 343i did for Halo 1&2)
If I have downside for Alyx itself and not just the noVR mod, it's that it's 67 gigabytes of space for an 8-15hour campaign, so reinstalling this for a replay will require a high threshold as I choose what space to clear and games to uninstall to make room for this.

I would say if you're not a hardcore HL fan then maybe wait for the noVR mods to become more polished and feature-complete, but personally I just liked the game too much so a thumbs up from me.",1688303989,1688303989,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

An important con:
- at least a half of the gameplay is a thriller/horror, where you're slowly crawling through dark places, waiting for a zombie around this corner.. or that.. is there a headcrab in the box? Or is it going to drop on me when I'll turn this switch on?.. And yes, Jeff, I'm about you too.

Okay so
The game has 98% positive reviews
With that said - this game is probably the only valid reason for you to buy the VR set
Unless you dont have enough budget/big enough room/problems with wearing such a thing

But since NoVR mod (on ModDB) is working pretty great and will have neat updates in the future, we gotta look into that deeper.

[h1]Main features[/h1]
Visuals, immersion and the huge level of details in level design - if you like this stuff - you will love this game. With or without VR - this game takes you in and you will struggle to leave.
Liquid physics, lighting, props everywhere, great optimization on an average PC. There a lot to tell.
Basically, its a very neat tech demo for Source 2.

[h1]But you are not Gordon Freeman and you do not have the HEV suit[/h1]
Now, if you came here for amazing gun blazing gameplay - dont expect a lot. You will shoot stuff from time to time, solve some basic puzzles(some are not present in Non-VR atm), some of which will require a standart awareness of your surroundings. Frankly, Half-Life 2 wasn't that great with shooting either, but in this game, if you play Below Hard - you will be bored, probably. On hard though - enemies are just bullet sponges. Although its cool that almost every enemy has a little trick to beat him fast like - shoot a propane tank, a parasite, or throw a grenade, or wait for him to reload etc, etc. There's really not too much enemies or their variety so yeah, there's that.

Also, there's lots of looting, scavenging and an okay-ish upgrade system (some of which are not present in Non-VR atm)

[h1]Embrace ""Combined"" Earth[/h1]
The events of the game - is a prequel to HL2 with an amazing twist at the end, though, expectable.
You are Alyx Vance - a rebel who will be dragged in some dramatic events pretty soon after start of the game. 
You will meet a couple of new characters, destroy a lot of property, explore some weird places and shoot a bunch of angry soldiers. At the end - well, there's a lot.
Expect lots of easter eggs and nostalgia emotions.
Soundtrack is...eh, its forgettable, in comparison to HL2+Episodes music. While the sound design is pretty great.
Level design is awesome, lots of things to mess around with (like the famous piano, pool table, touching everything you see)
Dialogues between Alyx and Russel (her partner-in-crime so to speak) are pretty cute and occasionally funny
And as for replay factor - only if you wanna hang around the whole game with the Damn Gnome. Or wanna play Fan Addons.

[h1]NoVR shenanigans[/h1]
The installation is easier than easy, they made it automatic this time.
Controls are decent, although you will occasionally noclip because the button is pretty near to Use Inventory buttons
Alyx will clip through some of the objects (will be fixed in next update)
Animations of the guns is whack (will be updated)
Enemies hit hard and you will fly through the whole room from time to time 
Some puzzles are already solved or require only one push of a button (will be updated)
Upgrades are pretty buggy and there's not too many of them atm (dont know about that one)
Final battle is too easy because of the workaround
Props will meddle with your movement a lot.
Currently 8 achivos are broken because of the scripts that rely on Alyx's Hands THAT DO NOT EXIST in the mod.
And some story scripts are broken and can be skipped completely  (giant hatch after Jeff moment for example)

Can you beat the game without Noclip though? - yes
Are there any critical bugs that made game unbeatable? - no.

[h1]TL;DR:[/h1]
Really good idea to add this to your collection if you are a Half-Life fan or if you have a VR set
You might wanna think twice (or thrice) otherwise since NoVR is Not Perfect.",1688212736,1688269058,True,125,5,0.832756876945495605,12,True,False,False

In my other reviews for Half-Life titles, I point out that having a PC without Half-Life is like having an Xbox without a Halo game or a nintendo console without a Mario game. This extends to VR and this game, and then some.

This is indeed the next Half-Life fans have been waiting for over a decade. It's great and not so great at the same time that it's VR exclusive. Great, because the experience cannot be the same in non-VR. Not so great, because not that many people can actually play it.
 

Also it has a pretty terrifying horror section, that doesn't even need to be in VR to be terrifying. Ravenholm is gonna be a trip through disneyland after this. 

And good lord, that ending... [spoiler] Another Half-Life, another cliffhanger [/spoiler], well, here's to another decade and a half.

I do have some criticisms though. There's never a shortage of pistol ammo and almost always a shortage of shotgun ammo. Everything else other than ammo and resin there are only 2 inventory slots.
Now I did play on normal difficulty, but there was really no sense of dread due to overabundance of pistol ammo and health items. Toning down with the combine soldier's health for normal difficulty sounds way better in my opinion. You wouldn't need so much pistol ammo if they didn't take 7 shots to the head to kill.

Also, why does the flashlight have to work only when it decides to? There's plenty of dark areas where it would've been useful, but it only works automatically in certain parts. I realize VR controllers have limited buttons for such things, but having it as a headlamp, for example, and having to press trigger near your forehead would've made its use much more pleasant.

I also have mixed feelings about the changes to enemy design. I understand they're for gameplay purposes, but in some cases, it's almost at the complete cost of consistency. 
Some creatures have new traits that weren't seen in events before and after this game's events, with no explanation whatsoever.

I will add more to this if I notice more issues.

That aside though, after 13 years, Valve can rest assured that this one was definitely worth the wait. I don't know how many reviews the devs read, but if this was one of them, I hope you take the criticism into consideration when making the next title.

If this doesn't become VR game of the year, or even Game of the year, I will be upset",1585141747,1688128948,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

Everytime I review any Half life game, i feel the need to say that I am a gen z so I don't have much nostalgia for older games so in other words I was sort of going into this game blind. Knowing part of the lore to understand who the characters were, but not enough about how the world works (combine, head crabs, ant lions, etc). 

But it was immersive. from physics, graphics, dialogue, characters, environment (so beautiful), and SO MUCH MORE. Its just so charming and the fact that it went from a pretty decent 1998 game with basic physics to being INSIDE the world of half Life, the enemies like the combine were TERRIFYING looking around a corner only to see a tank with a shotgun, and being with low ammo, it really makes you forget that youre in vr, the guns feel so good. 

But the best part is that not every situation you're put in can be solved with a gun, sometimes you need to be stealthy because the enemy you're facing is too dangerous to fight or there are too many that challenging them would be too risky. and exploring other places are encouraged cause sometimes you can be rewarded with loot like resin or ammo. Sometimes you  can see people talk to each other and it geniunley feels like those were real people, cause theiur dialogue gives them so much character. 

Thats not even close to describing how scary the atmosphere and places can be in Half life Alyx, from head crabs in cages, rooms full of dead bodies (who knows maybe one of them arent dead), 

if you have the money and the power (for pc graphics) get this game. I recommend it as  a person who has played half life both 1,2 and now Alyx.",1687893277,1687893277,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But plagued by a host of minor issue that turn it into a fairly tedious experience. It's very arcade-y: stay on the rails and do what you're expected inside your playpen and no one gets hurt. I spent the first hour just wrestling with the controls and keybinds, confused about the lack of obvious actions such as jumping, sprinting, turning the flashlight on/off(that one came a little later, but fits into the same vein of confusion), and trying to get the game to accept my preferred VR controls with my irl muscle memory for gun handling. Similarly, the amount of items you manage is very obviously and obtrusively managed for you. Every time the game reminds me that the ""backpack is ONLY for resin and full magazines"" I can't help but think of that joke about women's clothes having no pockets. Honestly I'd switch out storing resins for the ability to store items in the backpack since the upgrade system was kind of lackluster.

I understand that it was likely to facilitate optimal flow for players, ensuring that they don't need to worry about resources because those will spawn appropriately as you need them outside of combat, so that they can simply enjoy the game... But when a good third of said game is about rummaging through every drawer, shoebox, basket, and fridge with the physics-engine-enabled trash panda experience, that seems REALLY counter to the game's core design. I definitely spent more painstakingly moving my hoard of valuables from one area to the next than actually fighting and needing those items. Not because I really needed all those heals or booms, but because hoarding them is its own reward. I was also immensely disappointed when the keycards were single-use and offered no secrets later down the line when I opted to keep them past their obvious uses. And when I would find an obvious ""no coming back up that""-ledge I would run back to my cache of goodies to ensure nothing would be left behind, and in a few cases even ended up reloading an earlier save because the level-load areas came unexpectedly in plain rooms...

Going back to resins, I found most of the upgrades relatively useless and ended up saving before each to really think about whether I wanted to keep some new obtrusive feature on my guns, and to listen to the banter before moving on without them. For example the tactical sights were a distraction and annoyance over the plain iron sights, and I mostly ended up using it as a Dragonball Scouter over my eye to sweep rooms quickly. Instead of weapon-specific upgrades, I think it would have made more sense for the upgrades to be like Aftermarket parts irl; things you can freely put and remove from a gun (at the upgrade stations), switching around which part is on which gun to suit your need, with perhaps the ammo upgrades being the only truly gun specific ones, This way you could print as few or as many as you wanted of say, a laser or tactical sight, rather than having to buy it (at different costs, too???) for each gun to try out. It's a shame because the resin hunting itself is quite enjoyable and I ended up doing more for its own sake than because of the supposed benefits. 

Going back to how arcade-y the game is, I was continually startled by my entire field of vision turning orange from going out-of-bounds whenever I leaned a little too far back against a wall while doing CQB sweeps, how clunky the smooth movement was, and how ""sticky"" the physics interactions felt. My hands would seem to get stuck in drawers and doors, under and behind at un-intuitive angles. In combat the dissonance between ""geriatric shuffle"" and ""instant point-to-point teleport"" made for rather strange pacing and made turtling down my preferred tactic, especially as my hitbox seemed much larger than it should be given my careful management of angles and silhouette. And once it came time to defuse mines I actually ended up having to revert gun-hand settings to default once. Between the aforementioned orange vision issue, Alyx's badonkadonk dump truck ass pushing open a door and triggering a tripmine, and the my VR set-ups angles of coverage for hand tracking, it was impossible to defuse that one mine hidden behind the half-open door, ruining an otherwise very clever part of the game I was initially delighted to spot.

The way handedness also annoyed me, since I would have liked being able to switch hands when clearing corners, making use of my relative ambidexterity, or having the option to place the flashlight on my gun hand, along with the lack of ability to adjust the virtual hands alignment, as the handle of my oculus controls do not match the gun, throwing off my intuitive aim (which I eventually fixed IRL by 3d printing a gun handle for my controller, somewhat fittingly for the game's resin upgrade system).

Annoyingly, the game is also apparently considered a masterpiece, so the modding scene seems very reluctant to modify the game mechanically the same way say Skyrim VR's modders do. Say what you will about Bethesda, but their incompetence, laziness, and greed make their games better by virtue of irreverent modders than they could ever actually do themselves.

Also, kind of boring too. 

Much like HL2, Alyx took the initiative of front loading the intro of the game as the best part. By the time you get progressively deeper into the end of the game. The game finally picks up, throws tons of enemies at you with cool set pieces, and then it just ends. The mid-section is just meandering about, sifting through garbage, and occasionally being more mechanically advanced than a rail shooter.

I mean it has some advancements over the prior HL titles. Enemies are a bit more reactive when shot at as opposed to barely flinching in like HL1/2 despite being mag dumped with submachine gun. It’s cool they managed to get on par with Doom 1 in terms of how the shooting feels. But this game is never really demanding to the player in combat, you can hold a corner and solo the entire game with your Colt .45. The shotgun and plasma gun feel situational. Two of the only three guns in the game don’t feel particularly useful. The enemy AI is persistently less aggressive in comparison with HL2. 

You’re just rummaging about in industrial areas and places taken over by some xeno-infestation. Doing some boring ass puzzle solving. A fungus infected guy named ‘Jeff’ stood out as a highlight. But if you played any prior game with stealth segments and a shift in tone to horror, you know this game was outplayed and done by them. Thief Gold, Thief: Deadly Shadows, and TLOU come to mind.

Ya remember Boneworks? Supposedly, the devs were proposing a new HL title. What if they had a budget and they worked on HL: Alyx instead with Valve’s input? It would probably have been a better game.

This game carries itself on novelty. That novelty being the first AAA VR game done by competent devs. But afterwards, it just felt like you consumed air. It’s bewildering this game is held on a pedestal. It is because all the other VR games are boring hogshit tech demos that never go anywhere? I’d say yes.

6/10.

I thought I'd miss Merle but not at all, big shout-out to Ozioma Akagha who did an outstanding job for the voice acting of Alyx

Despite Mike Morasky doing a great job, I felt like the music was closer to Portal than Half-Life. I really missed Kelly's music but was happy when some of his previous works started to kick in

Ennemies were diversified and it was a real pleasure to kill them (especially one in particular), I wouldn't mind a bigger arsenal and AI was a bit of a lackluster tho

Map design is linear (it's Half Life, what did you expect?) but rewards exploration by giving stuff or some lore

The artistic direction is really over the top and I was in awe at several moments

Can't speak about story without spoiling so I won't talk about it

I had only one bug in the entire course of the game, which was a health syringe disapearing through the ground

Overall, it was an amazing experience and I really recommend it to all fans of the Half Life saga.
If your still hesitant buying a VR headset just to experience it I'd say go for it. IT IS FUCKING WORTH

The first play through is an experience I'll never forget. It was also the first VR game I ever played and to be introduced to VR in this manner is one of the best experiences in terms of 'gaming' you can get.

You are given the tools to survive and the game guides you through the experience in a somewhat interactive manner. 

There are many reasons to replay this title over and over again, first for the story, then for the visuals and surroundings, then for the interaction and the collectibles, then to platinum all achievements, all of which are worth it.. (even the gnome one).. Then you can explore the workshop items for it --some of which are gems--.

As my first serious foray into the VR realm, I found it to be the most refreshing and original gaming experience I've encountered since Half-Life 2 in 2005 and World of Warcraft in 2007.

Stepping into City 17 in VR is a breathtaking experience, offering a sense of immersion that truly makes the player feel a part of this dystopian universe. The lovingly detailed environments and the realistic physics interactions make the world come alive like never before.

One of the core strengths of Half-Life: Alyx is its seamless marriage of the familiar and the new. The game embraces the beloved elements that have come to define the Half-Life series - the menacing headcrabs, the shambling zombies, the relentless Combine soldiers, and the iconic arsenal of weapons are all faithfully represented in their VR incarnations.

However, it's the introduction of new mechanics - specifically designed to take full advantage of the VR platform - that truly propels this game into uncharted territory. Whether it's the intuitive gravity gloves that allow you to manipulate objects with a flick of your wrist or the innovative ways to interact with the environment, these mechanics open up exciting possibilities that evolve and expand all the way to the game's thrilling finale.

Alyx also offers a compelling extension to the Half-Life lore. As a prequel to Half-Life 2, the story is richly layered and is sure to pique the interest of series veterans and newcomers alike. It pushes me to revisit the previous episodes to piece together the intricate narrative tapestry that Valve has so masterfully woven.

The game also brings a whole new level of physicality to the Half-Life experience. Crouching in your room, using in-game objects for cover while evading Combine fire is a wholly unique experience that no traditional keyboard and mouse setup can replicate. It's both hilarious and intense, as the VR environment drives an unmatched level of player engagement.

Half-Life: Alyx is an exceptional addition to the Half-Life series, that utilizes VR to its fullest potential, improving on an already brilliant formula in groundbreaking ways.

Lastly, I would like to say that while I managed to snag this game at a 50% discount, it is undeniably worth every penny of the full price. If you're on the fence about making the purchase - don't waste your time on waiting. Valve has once again raised the bar in the realm of gaming, proving that they still possess the magic touch.

Developed by Valve Corporation, this long-awaited addition to the Half-Life franchise delivers an unforgettable experience that showcases the incredible potential of VR gaming.

One of the standout features of Half-Life: Alyx is its captivating and well-crafted narrative. Set between the events of Half-Life and Half-Life 2, players assume the role of Alyx Vance, a key character from the series, as she fights against the oppressive Combine forces in City 17. The story unfolds through a series of immersive encounters, intense combat situations, and thought-provoking puzzles.

From physically manipulating objects to solving intricate puzzles, the game takes full advantage of VR technology to immerse players in its world. The combat is intense and satisfying, with a variety of weapons and tools at your disposal. The need to physically dodge, duck, and take cover adds a heightened level of immersion and intensity to the combat encounters. The level design is exceptional, offering a mix of exploration, puzzle-solving, and intense action sequences that keep players engaged and on their toes.

Visually, Half-Life: Alyx is a technical marvel. The game boasts stunning graphics, detailed environments, and impressive attention to detail. From the decaying urban landscapes to the alien-infested areas, each setting feels richly realized and contributes to the game's immersive atmosphere. The lighting effects, particle systems, and realistic physics simulations further enhance the visual fidelity, creating a world that feels alive and reactive to player actions.

The audio design in Half-Life: Alyx is exceptional, adding another layer of immersion to the experience. The sound effects are incredibly detailed, capturing the subtle nuances of environmental interactions and combat encounters. The spatial audio enhances the sense of presence and realism, allowing players to accurately pinpoint the direction of sounds in the game world. The voice acting is superb, with the performances of the cast bringing the characters to life and adding depth to the storytelling.

One of the most impressive aspects of Half-Life: Alyx is its ability to deliver a sense of presence and immersion that only VR can provide. The game makes excellent use of VR technology to create a truly interactive and lifelike experience. From physically reaching out to grab objects to leaning around corners to peek at enemies, every action feels tangible and responsive. The sense of scale and presence in the virtual world is astonishing, making players feel like they have truly stepped into the Half-Life universe.

In conclusion, Half-Life: Alyx is a masterpiece of virtual reality gaming. Its compelling narrative, immersive game-play, stunning visuals, and exceptional use of VR technology combine to create an experience that is both groundbreaking and unforgettable. Valve has demonstrated the immense potential of VR gaming through this title, showcasing the power of the medium to deliver unprecedented levels of immersion and engagement.

There are several VR games that focus on interesting mechanics but overused gameplay or simple gimmicks, or have one trick that's hella fun but only that one trick, or they feel great to play but lack in character, story, etc. But with VR being still a relatively new market, it's hard to come across something with all of those. It's a bit too early for premium quality triple-A games to be in the immersive virtual world.

To that idea Valve said ""f*ck you, here's a game with as much quality as any other big release console or PC game, crafted to take full advantage of virtual reality.""
Not only is this a game that continues the story of Half-Life and finally gives us some new content after 13 long years, but it also, yknow, has a story. It has a gripping, super cool plot and fun characters throughout, with the Valve quality we've come to love. Dialogue is funny, animations are so damn realistic and graphics are so phenomenally appealing they make you actually feel like you're in City 17 in your headset, and music is all fantastic.
And that's just setting the scene. The gameplay... OH BOY THE GAMEPLAY.
Valve keeps their crown for being second to none in creativity. They are the most innovative and crafty studio in the world, and that reflects beautifully in this game. There is shooting, yoinking physics objects with your specialized Gravity Gloves, and creative puzzles with objects and wires with Alyx's handy Multi-Tool. And you bet your ass they thought of taking advantage of the hardware they made this game for too. You'll be ducking behind cover, twisting and turning through levels, and moving all around in the shoes of the Eli Vance's daughter. The game is only about 12-15 hours long, and is worth every second and every cent. God dammit Valve, you did it again. You made a masterpiece.

Even though you need a good enough PC to run it and a VR headset I have a Quest 2...I don't want to hear it was financial reasons. But the standards were set with a lot of acceptability features to combat motion sickness which I don't get sick that much in games but wow I rarely got sick or I forgot to take a break and I still felt fine. The graphics are amazing well for VR standards and it's Source 2 thank god.

I'm actually kind of happy that I had the technical and financial problems because once I got everything ironed out there were tons of fan content on the workshop already to go like Return to Rapture, Gunman Contracts and LEVITATION just to name a few.

If you are getting into the VR space and you want to have a great story, gameplay, acceptability and mod support. This is an extreme recommendation for you and I can't wait for the next gen VR headsets like Index 2 (if that ever happens), Quest 3, etc pushing HL:A to it's limits and hope other developers look at HL:A specially it's acceptability motion features take note of it.",1685935612,1685935612,True,1,0,0.514170050621032715,0,True,False,False

Gameplay is paced according to VR interaction, and I am glad I didn’t spoil it after waiting multiple years to get a Valve Index. It will take some time before a comparable product is released with this amount of things to do. Everything is able to be picked up, and can be used in creative ways to traverse the world. 
Gunplay is very satisfying, and easy to pick up. Sound design is on point and the game runs very smooth and responsive on my outdated machine.

The thing that got me about this game is the visuals but on top of that the amount of interaction that can be done with the environment. Being able to draw with a marker, being able to pick up glass bottles and toss them, gun play is terrific and so forth.

There are tons of things that I can rave about this game but everything I'm going to say has already been covered numerous times.

When I mean trash, I mean the type of stuff that when you shoot someone they have the flying GMod physics that look like they were trying to make a human omelet. But, in Half-Life: Alyx, it uses the mechanic that with heavier items it's harder to pick up. For example, you cannot pick up a crate with only one hand. Another mechanic is how an item cannot pass through a wall if you're on one side trying to go to the move you're gun to the other side in a shootout.

The guns are alright, they feel nice to shoot but the combat was disappointing. The guns don't really have much effect on enemies, you just kinda shoot until they die. It would've been nice to see them have more reactions to getting shot instead of just a slight staggering animation, things like crippling legs or loss of limbs.

The graphics and optimization are great, even on my mid tier pc with a Quest 2 the game was still pretty stunning and ran beautifully. The audio is really nice and I enjoyed the environment and interactions with npc's. The puzzles were also pretty neat, solving things was very satisfying.

From the moment you step into the shoes of Alyx Vance, you're transported to the dystopian world of City 17 like never before. The attention to detail is mind-blowing, with every nook and cranny meticulously designed. The graphics are stunning, pushing the limits of what VR can achieve, and the level of immersion is unparalleled. Exploring the meticulously crafted environments, interacting with objects, and solving puzzles feels incredibly natural and satisfying.

The gameplay itself is a perfect blend of action, exploration, and puzzle-solving. The combat mechanics are superb, utilizing VR technology to its fullest potential. The ability to physically duck behind cover, aim and shoot with precision, and wield a variety of weapons feels incredibly intuitive and immersive. The encounters with enemies, especially the terrifying headcrabs, will keep you on your toes and your heart racing.

What sets Half-Life: Alyx apart is its captivating narrative. The story is a prequel to the events of Half-Life 2, and it weaves seamlessly into the existing lore of the series. The characters are well-developed, and Alyx Vance takes center stage as a compelling protagonist. The voice acting is top-notch, and the dialogue is engaging, adding depth and emotional resonance to the overall experience.

One minor downside is that the game's length may leave some craving more. While the campaign offers a solid 15 to 20 hours of gameplay, dedicated players might finish it quicker. However, the replayability factor is high, thanks to collectibles, hidden areas, and the desire to experience the game's world again.

In conclusion, Half-Life: Alyx is a monumental achievement in VR gaming. It raises the bar for what can be accomplished in virtual reality, delivering a captivating story, intuitive gameplay, and breathtaking visuals. Valve has once again demonstrated their mastery of game design, creating an experience that is both thrilling and unforgettable. Whether you're a fan of the Half-Life series or a VR enthusiast, this game is an absolute must-play that will leave you in awe of its immersive world and innovative gameplay mechanics.",1683074155,1685228286,True,22,0,0.650737643241882324,2,True,False,False

Half Life Alyx has made every other VR game feel half baked, it's really set the golden standard for what a VR game should have: immersion, story, fun gameplay mechanics, all coupled together with great visuals and humor. Whenever Valve does release a game, it changes the gaming community in some way, such as how Half Life 2 pioneered physics in gaming. Half Life Alyx's port over to virtual reality is an amazing step in the right direction from Valve, and I honestly hope going forward that this will be Valve's new standard going forward: virtual reality. It adds such a unique flavor that can't be achieved in flat screen gaming. There were moments in HLA where I was terrified just with how immersive the experience was. I desperately await Valve's new VR  titles, if they're even half as good as HLA, it'll be an amazing experience (fingers are crossed for Left 4 Dead 3, Portal 3, Team Fortress 3 all in VR)!",1685219789,1685219789,True,18,1,0.67287600040435791,0,True,False,False

The graphics are the best I've ever seen, even beating out kayak vr, which is literally a game made to demo vr visuals. I have a 4090 and 13900k and can crank the settings up to max on a quest2 with half the GPU utilization to spare. I expect the visuals to hold up for years to come.

Alyx has been available for over 3 years now and I'm yet to find a VR game that comes in any way close to how Alyx looks, feels, and overall plays. I can't quite put my finger on it but Valve did an incredible job immersing the player. The way the game gives you feedback about the environment is second to none, it's almost as if you can feel walls and objects. The only thing that's still missing is a magic weight pack of sorts for your VR controllers so we could finally feel the weight of objects (I doubt I'd be able to wiggle around a heavy Combine Soldier this easily IRL, haha). The only downside is the over-the-shoulder-item-management. The box where it registers interaction could be a bit bigger, especially when you're trying to fumble with mags because you once again emptied your gun earlier than expected.

Furthermore, I have to say that I never played any of the Half-Life titles before (I know, I know). But I don't care that I have no idea what's happening in this world. Why? Because I am IN this world and have no other choice but somehow deal with it. I love it, I can't recommend it enough.",1684937159,1684937294,True,8,0,0.586776852607727051,1,True,False,False

This is the premier title that shows exactly what VR is capable of and how every VR game should play. I played through the whole game on the OG Vive on a 1070 and i7 6700 at 90hz and it was great. Now with a new build and an index headset + knuckles controllers, the game at 120hz feels brand new.

It sounds trite to say that the audio is a major part of a game but in HL:A, the sound design and music and positional audio really take you into the world. Even in spots where I knew there were going to be sudden enemies I was still startled due to how good the audio is and how good the level design is.

MILD SPOILERS AHEAD: The story follows Alyx on a quest to save her father after the combine kidnap him. There are a small handful of other characters and they all feel like they fit in and belong there. The game does have some jumpscare parts and one scary sneaking section but they are tastefully done and they teach you about safe navigation through the world and add to the immersion. I am startled easily and I was still able to enjoy the whole experience.

There are a handful of weapons in the game that fill their respective roles well. Reloading weapons is ""realistic"" enough to make you feel powerful but also ""arcady"" enough to not get in the way of the flow of combat. Upgrades are not mandatory but they add variety to the gunplay and there are a few QoL upgrades too (optics, bigger magazines, alt-fire modes, etc.). Make sure you are searching under every box and behind every half-wall for the upgrade material.

If you have a VR headset and don't have this game, you are majorly missing out. My hope is that Valve makes more VR games because HL:A alone makes the investment worth it. After finishing it once, I recommend playing through again with the developer commentary. 

Tips: 
0. If you are having a ""mongoose timeout"" error, add ""-novid"" (without the quote marks) to the launch properties. It will just skip the Valve into video with the bald guy with the valve in his head and has no effect on the rest of the game.

1. If you are startled easily or get too immersed, I recommend lowering the sound and use off-ear audio. You still get immersed but have a little more grounding to reality.

2. Even on the hardest difficulty, the game provides enough healing items and ammo to get the job done if you are paying attention. If you want to make it extra hard, try throwing away some ammo or healing items. You can also try to limit yourself to using only one of the two available ""pouches"" to store a healing item or grenade (or use neither for even more challenge).

3. Don't forget to check out the workshop for a small but high quality collection fan-made mods and new levels and some totally different stories!",1684626881,1684626881,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's actually very unfortunate how good this game is as it just sets the bar for what a VR game could be SO high, nothing I have played since has come anywhere even close to this, it's not nostalgia for the 'Half-Life' franchise either as this is the first game played from the series, in fact after playing this I decided to purchase half life 2 and try the community made VR mod within that game.

Playtime:
I am actually not sure how long it took me to complete the game, as mentioned before I have completed it all the way through twice and played a couple of the Community made maps with their story and am only just over 20 hours. I never felt that the game dragged on, I was actually quite upset when I completed it the first time round because I got so invested in it.

The Story:
Easy to understand, has very likeable characters even to someone who has no knowledge of the Half-Life lore.
Although avoiding any spoilers I will say that I found the ending quite upsetting, I feel like It should have had a rock solid ending that cleared up all my questions and concerns but instead I found the ending rather sour, leaving me even more confused. 

Gameplay:
Very, very controlled, basically just keep moving forward, once you have moved on from an area you cannot go back unless you reload the previous chapter, for some players this may be too controlling but for me it was perfectly fine.

Map Design:
At a certain point I did start getting a little irritated about the large amount of time you spend underground and in subway tunnels rather then seeing the graphically impressive outside world, after playing a little more though and getting more into the combat I realised it did make sense for the developers to (and this is of course all a guess) make it more playable on lower end hardware and focus the player more on the gameplay.

The Graphics:
As mentioned before, the game looks incredible even on the lower end headset display that I used, the Meta Quest 2, even with that headset though, I was in shock the whole time, It's actually quite hard to compare it to any other games (both VR and Non-VR) that I have played, The best way to see what it's like is to just watch some gameplay or the trailers online.

Community Features:
There are tons of hours to be spent in Half-Life Alyx, not only in the main story but with all of the community made maps and custom campaigns. Even if you don't want to dive into a new story at all there are still loads of things you can customise like custom Resin Models and Weapon remakes from the old Half-life games.

The Price: 
Whilst a little pricey, I would highly recommend grabbing it.

[/list]
Does it need further introduction? Ok I get it... you may have not been around long enough to experience true classics due being busy playing fortnite. While i'm sure everyone is/was waiting for Half Life 3 (but got this instead) is a bit disappointed... I am here to tell you that... it did not (despite still high hopes and dreams for HL3). This story is set years before HL2 where you play Alyx Vance and as usual will need to put a stop to those meddling combine aliens. While VR may not be for everyone, this is likely, despite being released 3 years ago, still one of the best VR titles in the space for its genre, which is sad to an extent... but shows VR capabilities (if companies are willing to throw a butload of money at it).

[list]
[*][h1]Gameplay[/h1]
[/list]
As any Half Life game to date... this one has it all... exploration, combat, puzzles, story... and even the occasional jump scare.
Personally one of the most satisfying things in VR is the level of interaction with the environment and this game took it a step further where i can interact with the most random and useless things that have zero contribution to the actual game. 
The physics in this game are simply amazing. To illustrate... when you fire your pistol... not only you can clearly see the bullet case jumping from the gun... but that same bullet case is actually interactable to the point that if it hits a movable object in its trajectory (e.g. a soda can...) it will throw it down. If that isn't mind-blowing...
The AI is fairly smart in combat/events and one of the best things i found is that you actually need to manage your ammo since you don't necessarily have a crowbar to help you :)

[list]
[*][h1]Graphics[/h1]
[/list]
The best graphical detail (to date) I ever saw in a VR game. It is also the heaviest game where even a beefy computer will struggle if you max out everything but worry not as I personally played on medium settings and everything was equally amazing since for the level of quality experienced this game seems to have been extremely optimized.

[list]
[*][h1]Length | Replayability[/h1]
[/list]
You can expect to take anywhere from 12 to 18 hours on the main story depending on how much time you spend gazing at how amazing this game is and trying to investigate every corner of every area. On top of that there is a substantial amount of mods available, with new maps, weapons, enemies and more, developed by the community that are also amazing and provide further hours of gameplay.

[list]
[*][h1]Worth Buying?[/h1]
[/list]
Not only worth but mandatory if you enjoy VR as this game sets the bar for what is possible. The price without any discount is in my view worth it, especially when comparing with other titles that are no where near but charge top dollar, however if you are not in a rush, it goes on discount every now and then

But the execution of the game is where it truly shines. Game mechanics refined to a point of near perfection, this game is a shining example of what Triple A game quality should look like in VR. The detail of the headcrab's claws and belly create a truly immersive atmosphere, as well as the textures. It was almost as if I could get a feel for the game by looking at it. The softness of the headcrabs, the smooth surface of the Combine's mask, the rough, tough nature of the walls, it all screams immersiveness. Although sound design is often overlooked, Alyx takes account of echo and ambience to deliver a truly immersive experience. As a VR game, it plays it safe, but manages to surprise, please, and wow the player in many ways. It is truly the pinnacle of virtual reality experiences. Walking down a dynamite filled hall to grab a valve, the ambience and growling of headcrab zombies being all you hear through the earth-shattering quiet, Alyx manages to immerse the player in a way most VR games never succeed to do. When people tell you how VR is amazing, THIS is what they are talking about. As a Half-Life game, it has nice bits of lore, top-notch story (for a prequel anyways), and a good quality you expect from Valve. However, as a fairly experienced VR player, the game felt a little campy in some aspects. Valve knew this would be many peoples first foray into virtual reality, launching alongside the Index. However, four hours in, I have not died yet. This isn't truly a criticism and more of an observation though, as I never thought the game felt ""too easy"", only in comparison to other Half-Life games. Other than that bit, Alyx is a state of the art VR game that Meta and Sony should take note of. Truly a masterpiece of its medium.",1683680999,1683680999,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

And this is the only VR game I've played so far that had this many issues. I use a HP Reverb G2 on a RTX 3070 with I7-12700K and 48GB RAM.

Long story short, i googled for a week and i browsed the steam forums for any clue on how to make it better. And after a week of trial and error and testing everything in human knowledge, i finally got the game to run stable and without any crashes.

And what i have to say about this game is that it's definitively a worthy installment in the Half-Life franchise. I spent hundreds of hours playing the first Half-Life with every story expansion and multiplayer, and Half-Life 2 the same way, and i consider those games to be among the top 3 games I've ever played.

Looking past the issues i had with Alyx to begin with, when it works, it's not only a fantastic game at it's core, it's also a showcase on how to do VR correctly, Valve just set's the bar with this game, a bar for which every one else will struggle to match, let alone surpass.

I might just have been extremely unlucky with my headset and setup, i don't know. The main thing that fixed my problems was to change from Direct3D 11 to Vulkan API. So i don't count my technical issues into my review, they were annoying beyond belief, but the game redeemed itself once it was working.

Anyhow. Yes, i do recommend the game. Immersive visuals and story, good performance. Russel's voice and way of speaking almost 1:1 resembles a Canadian colleague of mine, so funny every time he speaks.
BUT
Despite the time and money at Valve's disposal, it still has bugs e.g. 
- disappearing items, 
- collision errors, 
- at some places you fall through the floor, 
- the ""low graphics settings"" error that is there from the start, 
- spawning in the air sometimes, 
- unawarded achievements, etc, 

and unsympathetic design decisions e.g. 
- backpack only holds resin and ammo (probably infinite at that), but not any health recharger syringes, grenades, or mission items 
- the placement of items -- you would think enemy soldiers had ammo magazines and such, but no, you find them in cupboards and trash heaps
- when there are actually ammo on dead soldiers, the soldiers disappear very fast and ammo with them.
- the flashlight -- dont tell me its for performance reasons, because sometimes it activates by the game in wide/busy and not dark areas too.

There is some trickery going on in the background with automatically scaling graphics settings and performance that makes some youtubers and articles say to set it to ultra even on potato computers and others saying to set to low even on NASA machines... Would have been nice if the devs gave some help and documentation about it, preferably ingame.

It was only two years ago during the pandemic when I had lost a patient I was operating on during ER. She was the first one I've lost. At first I only thought of it as ""just another respiratory illness"" among the multitude of seniors flooding in. But a child no older than my 7 y.o. niece? I pulled everything out of my bag of tricks but there was only so many treatments for advanced pneumonia-like symptoms. They said hundreds of thousands are dying all around the world, but for me, a child is a child. A life is a life. Did I choose the wrong profession? Am i betraying God's will by trying to save those who shan't be saved? Was my oath taken in pride and vanity. I had to leave, hoping if fate lures me back I'd reconsider it then.

Retirement was as expected: someone who's been working his ass off his entire life rarely has time for personal endeavors. And with the pandemic, inability to travel. My friends and colleagues thought I was crazy not to be living it up and doing everything I wanted to do now that I'm out of the grind. My take: I'm such a pathetic wretch, I don't even have one single hobby. A confidant recommended I check out the tech industry, starting with VR (as it was also making the medical rounds). Enter Half-Life: Alyx. Wow, while I was cutting up bodies the nerds were busy cutting up circuits. The visuals in VR are simply stunning. Sure this dystopian sci-fi setting was not mellowing out the lockdown mood but the writing was more intriguing than most Hollywood scripts. Every dead body I passed by reminded me of the collateral casualties of recent times; I proceeded uneasily. But the last straw: I had to jab myself with the medical syringe...the flashback was like someone woke you up from a dream with a pail of cold water. Natalie? Was that her name? I shut off everything right then and there.

A few months passed and I tried out a few more hobbies, one more intense than the other: mountain biking, sportsbike track days; yes, things more suited for those 30 years junior but concentration or death kept recent events off my mind. Recently, the FB metaverse in the news reminded me of VR and this game. Although I dreaded having to open drawers and doors like an OCD person, I jumped back into the rabbit hole. Maybe enough time had passed, but I think hearing Alyx's voice helped me push through to completion this time. I can't credit this game enough for helping me through the unknowing guilt, but I felt a tremendous weight lifted off my shoulder and am at peace.

The graphics are top-notch and the immersion is just amazing. Once I started playing, I didn't want to touch any other game until I finished it, beat saber is an exception xD. I played 20 hours in one week, but then had to take a break cuz my headset was causing trouble. During that break, I played Boneworks, and I have to admit, I was pretty impressed with the interactions in that game. But even though Boneworks enhanced my gameplay experience, I was still super curious about the ending of Half Life Alyx, so I went back to it. And it was totally worth it. Even though the gameplay wasn't as good as Boneworks, the graphics and the story made the rest of the game an incredible experience for me. And the ending was really cool. So, if you're looking for an immersive VR game with a great story, definitely try this out. And I can't wait to dive into the next series :D",1682702174,1682702174,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

They added new aliens, guns, equipment, concepts, etc. which keeps it fresh. There, of course, are tons of puzzles you have to navigate to advance further. The dialog from all of the characters, including Alyx, is FUNNY! I catch myself chuckling at the sarcasm and commentary from Russell a lot throughout the game. And it's interesting hearing Alyx make comments or ask questions about life before the seven hour war- also something we're not used to because we never heard Gordon speak. Something I really like about the series is you're learning everything as Gordon/Alyx is learning. There's no cutting to story or really any elaboration beforehand. Obviously we have context from the previous games for Half-Life: Alyx, but I really like that they continued doing that. The game is beautiful! The attention to detail is insane! As I'm defeating enemies, I often have to take an extra look around to make sure I didn't miss any ammo or resin. And being able to upgrade your firearms??? SUCH a cool feature! Special shout out to Jeff, as he's absolutely terrifying! They did a great job making you feel like you're really there. To the few jump scares, size of enemies and even being able to feel your heart beat in the controllers when you're low on health, you're totally immersed. I am more than satisfied with this game.

Is it the most replayable VR game out there? Ehh not really.. There are some insanely top quality mods on the workshop that are must play in my opinion (Gunman contracts, return to rapture, etc.)  but it’s really a one maybe two playthrough kind of game. But that playthrough is fantastic, the story is an absolute masterclass as to be expected from Valve, the immersion and interactivity with the world and objects found within is great, and the music/sound design is really top notch. 

As an added bonus Half Life Alyx is one of like 2 VR games to make me genuinely scared. Not by cheesy gimmick or jumpscare but just genuine immersive horror. Also the gnome achievement is super surreal to complete in VR. 

If I had to give one negative about the game it would be the lack of melee combat since there is really something to be said about being able to physically beat the s*** out of enemies, but admittedly, it probably wouldn’t fit this game very well given the layout of combat encounters. 

Perfect 10 since it’s the only VR title that I’ve played that feels like a “real” AAA game.

Half Life Alyx has a great story, great gameplay (Tho, a bit easy). There are a multiple movement modes for comfort and preference, but regular walking (No blink, no teleport) is not great since it's slow and there is no sprint. 
Half Life Alyx is great to me, as I never experienced Half Life 2 ""Change Gaming"". But I got to experience that partially with Alyx. I say 'partially' for the reason that Alyx just isn't accessible. Half Life Alyx is better than Boneworks, but it is still a tech demo in a way. Let me say, it never ever felt like a tech demo (Because of incredible gameplay, story, characters, and scenery). 
But you can tell this game is best played with the Index, with how good the game looks and since it was meant to be paired with the index. 
Good Scenery? Index's Resolution.
Good Physics? Index's 'Knuckle' controllers.
I use a quest 2, I don't have the room or money for the Index. And it feels a very slight bit lacking. And because this game is meant to be paired with the Index, Valve thinks most people who'd buy the Index would have the hardware specs to crush Alyx. And that is fair to believe, 100%.
I don't have those specs that they're thinking of, but I have better than the recommended and I am using medium/low with some things even disabled. Just to get 60 FPS.
Other than those issues, its a great game.",1681690955,1681747240,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

It's like a shot of pure adrenaline straight to the heart. I mean, you put on that VR headset and suddenly you're transported to a whole other world. It's like stepping into a dream, but a dream that's realer than real.

And let me tell you, as someone who's been around the block a few times, that game is something special. It's like nothing I've ever seen before. It's like the guys who made it took everything that VR can do and turned it up to eleven. It's like they said, ""Okay, we're gonna make a VR game, but we're not gonna do it like anyone else has ever done it before. We're gonna blow people's minds.""

And you know what? They did. They blew my goddamn mind. That game is so immersive, so intense, that sometimes I forgot I was even in my own living room. I was so caught up in the action, so swept away by the story, that I lost myself completely. And that, my friend, is what gaming is all about. It's about losing yourself in another world, another reality, and feeling like you're really there.

So yeah, you're right. Alyx is significantly better than everything else VR has to offer right now. And I wouldn't be surprised if it stayed that way for a good long while. Those guys who made it are geniuses, and they've set the bar pretty damn high. But you know what? That's okay. Because even if nothing else ever comes close to Alyx, we'll still have that game. We'll still have that feeling of being transported to another world, of being a part of something incredible.

Is it the best VR game? Probably...

Valve have done it again. The Half Life franchise is basically PC game royalty and Half Life: Alyx keeps up the almost impossible standards of quality that we've come to expect from the series. If you've got a VR headset and haven't played this yet, then why did you bother buying one?!

The Good
-----------
[list]
[*] Really immersive. The atmosphere, the graphics, the controls, the sound, the lighting, the physics - everything comes together to make this the most immersive experience I've had so far in VR. Whenever I came back to Alyx after playing another VR game, it immediately just felt better and far more immersive than anything else out there.
[*] It has a fantastic story that ties in extremely well with the other Half Life games, especially Chapter 2. That ending... Just wow! (Make sure you sit through the credits for the post-credit scene)
[*] Superb voice acting. Russell is new to the series and added some much-needed levity throughout. I believe that the actress who plays Alyx is different from the original but she does such a good job that I wouldn't have noticed if someone else hadn't pointed it out.
[*] The horror bits are great. That section in the lift - aaaargh!! The action bits are great.
[*] The VR game design has been incredibly well thought out. Everything feels natural from picking things up, from reloading the guns, the gravity gloves never get old. It's a joy to play and soon feels really natural.
[*] The enemies are familiar but the game presents them in way that you haven't experienced before; i.e., killing ant lions is definitely done differently from HL2. The ""electricity dogs"" were my favourite but I'm glad there weren't too many of them!
[*] Fantastic graphics. These are the best I've seen in a PC VR game so far by a long way. Great lighting as well.
[*] The difficult level is pitched to just the right challenge. I died quite a few times and while there are a couple of tough sections I think that most gamers will be able to complete the game.
[*] Excellent performance. Valve have shown that you really can have your cake and eat it when it comes to graphics and performance. I start playing on a Ryzen 2600X / 5700XT set up and had no performance problems on Medium settings, half way through I upgraded to a 13700K / GTX 4080 so got to play with everything set to maximum quality.
[*] The sound effects take you straight back to HL2 and they've extended them to the VR universe brilliantly. Nostalgia done in the perfect way. The soundtrack is pretty decent too.
[*] The puzzles make good use of the environment and VR set-up. The repeated puzzles for opening containers and the upgrade machines gradually increase in difficulty as the game progresses and do not outstay their welcome.
[*] The game is a good length and will take most people 16-20 hours to complete, I think. The chapters are long enough that you can comfortably play one chapter per sitting before VR-fatigue sets in.
[*] Pedantic, but I like that you lose your ammo if you reload too soon. Most games, apart from the serious combat sims, just let you reload all the time, constantly, without any consequences.
[*] No bugs encountered throughout my play through.
[/list]

The Bad
---------
[list]
[*] Movement speed is painfully slow. While I appreciate that this may be done deliberately - certainly at the beginning - to help people orient themselves in the VR environment, it feels daft that you're walking around at a snail pace while involved in a firefight.
[*] No melee fighting, which seems an odd and obvious missed opportunity given how much Half Life is associated with crowbars. While I appreciate that it is Gordon's crowbar, plenty of other things lying around (i.e., wrenches) could be used as melee weapons.
[*] The action scenes are awesome but there aren't too many of them. 2-3 more would have been very welcome.
[*] You will look stupid when someone walks into the room to find you crouching behind a wall that they can't see and shooting blindly over it. Lock the door!
[*] It reminds you just how good Valve are at making games - and frustrates you that they don't make more!

I really like how the game keeps introducing different mechanics that takes advantage of/highlights its VR medium (the Jeff level, holy SHIT), keeping things fresh even towards the very end.

Speaking of the end, the final chapter of the game has made it into my top 10 (5, even) video game sequences of all time. Beautifully executed art direction, music, and sound design. And it would not have had the same impact on me if it wasn't in VR. I was going to play this game with the no-VR mod, but I am SO glad I didn't and was able to experience it with the Index.

The game's attention to detail extends beyond just gameplay mechanics, as every aspect of the environment and sound design work together to create an incredibly immersive experience. As you explore the ruined City 17, you'll be surrounded by incredible sights and sounds that truly transport you to another world. From the eerie silence of abandoned buildings to the cacophony of Combine machinery and the unsettling whispers of headcrabs, the game's sound design is second to none.

SWEET JESUS

I started my Half Life: Alyx journey by dual wielding beer bottles. I tipped them down my gullet confused why I couldn't feel the beverage pouring down by throat. Then i froze, ""I REALLY hope no one can see me right now"". But I was having so much fun I didn't care. 

Such a bizarrely fun experience this VR stuff is.

I wandered the empty streets trying to finger pigeons who foolishly allowed me dangerously close. I had no idea what sort of sadistic arse i'd become immediatly in this digital world, I thought I'd be saving terrified guards from zombies, but no, I was trying to finger dirty pigeons on the street for hours after misbehaving with endless bottles of liquor. What a ****ing gem this game is.

Five minutes into this mind altering experience and i picked up a plastic bottle and held it up to my eye and it just completely blew my mind the level of detail that continued all the way through. I cannot get over how immersive this game is. The shaders, the textures, the lighting. All absolute top notch. 

Peering into that plastic bottle, trying to spin something in the air, or tossing an object and seeing it land exactly where you expected it to with amazing precision. Goofing around in the world it dawned on me: Half Life Alyx isn't just a game, it's the most advanced, incredible toy ever made, and it can even be enjoyed even by jaded, old sob's like me. 

Alyx represents not just years of game development, but years of innovation to interactivity, Head tracking, interface, and graphics by one of the largest most advanced talent pools in human history. If you're new to VR, this experience hits like a ton of bricks with all the competency and innovation that goes into this experience. It's a revelation. The mind wanders wondering if we'll get full on movies and entirely new genres of entertainment now that Valve has shown a small bit of the potential of VR.

I'm not saying this with hyperbole. Half Life Alyx is the pinnacle of technical innovation in all of entertainment up to this day, and as you experience this artful story and setting, you can pick up anything around you and be a total fruit @$$, throwing it at anyone in the world, or make any kind of obscene action you wish in this world without any embarrassment. This is true freedom from all the mundane social niceties as you teabag zombies and toss their bodies about with joy, unless of course someone is watching you make a total fool of yourself with this stupid headset on. 

I kinda felt like Mr. Bean playing this, a total weirdo, devoid of shame, thinking of all manner of ways to interact with the world around me to be a total bafoon for the fun of it all. I haven't encountered a single enemy yet, because I have been carefully walking the rooftops, clay jars in hand, looking for some poor soul to walk by so I can toss it with all my might and try to smash their heads in. Jolly good fun.

Is it worth the pain in the butt setup? Is it worth installing VR, learning the kinks of the interface and finally getting the game running?

A RESOUNDING ""yes"". 

The game is so good one has to wonder why there isn't more chatter. Perhaps it's that the tech is improving so fast that no one wants to dev for it. Or maybe it's just too expensive for mass adoption. Or the massive investment cost. Or maybe Valve just isn't in bed with the right major companies to get the attention they deserve with this project.

I'm so blown away by the tech and immersion that I haven't even commented on the stellar animation, interactive puzzles, and story interjected within this joyous romp. And frankly, i don't even care to remark on the 10/10 game because the tertiary elements eclipse the core game. I'm going to have to play this again to give the dialogue and story the attention they deserves, because as I'm being told about the danger my (Alyx's) father is in, all i can think about is how cool it is to smash bottles, and pull things towards me and catch them with these perfectly implemented force powers. Holding weapons, reloading them, chambering rounds, using force like powers... it's all so damned rewarding, and as you master this incredibly organic interface system, you start feeling like a real badass, as you make weird motions alone in your living room. Shooting things has so much tangibility, that it's hard to go back to pressing a mouse to fire in other FPS's.

If you have the means, or if you can steal a headset from someone for a few days treat yourself to this incredible experience. It's a bit trickier and not as immersive, but you can pick up a quest 2 and get this set up for a semi reasonable price. If you have kids it's much better exercise using one of these than sitting on the couch with a handheld device.

Half Life: Alyx is an absolute banger. It's the closest I've gotten to the magic of Christmas morning since becoming a jaded, bitter old man in a video game. 

(21/10) This is a mind blowing roller coaster ride ON TOP of being an incredible game, easily worth the price of admission many times over.

I played this on a quest 2 and the experience was still incredible and fully worth it. Addressing most of the negative reviews (that I have read, not including crash complaints) are about how there's no melee and the non teleport movement is to slow. (99% of these people come from boneworks/bonelab) witch is a complaint i guess. But valve made this to kick-start vr, and they wanted it to be friendly to people who haven't played it before. So it makes sense they should make it anti sickens. But it is annoying there is no sprint or anything. Other than that this is the best vr game I have ever played. (to be fair I haven't played very many).

This is what I have been looking for from VR since I bought my Oculus Quest 2 about a year ago.  The way this game takes me back to the original Half Life  and Half Life 2 is nothing short of incredible!  A combination of nostalgia while pushing back the boundaries of VR gaming is nothing short of amazing.

My setup is i7 8700, RTX 3060ti, 16Gb DDR4 3200mhz, Windows 11 on SSD @ read speed 450mb/s, game is on NVME PCIe 3.0 @ read speed 3500mb/s.  Oculus Quest 2 running @ 120 mhz with a latency of around 6ms on a USB 3.2 type c to c 16 ft cable

My average gaming session in this configuration was 1 to 2 hours.  There were some glitches using this setup but I'd say 95% reliable.  Sometimes when I got moving around a lot with the cable it would glitch and crash.  It seems like a little movement at the headset connector would cause it to crash.  I would be playing and my peripheral vision would start to go black with fine lines and the controls would stop responding.  The only solution seemed to be reset the headset.  I ended up solving it by zip tying the cable close to the headset connector securely .  I don't love using the cable but I found gaming for an hour or more it would only use 10 to 20 percent of the headset charge.  I did connect very successfully with Airlink but found it would go from 85% to 30% charge in about 40 minutes.  The headset would then take almost 2 hours to recharge with a 20 watt Anker type c to c charger.  If you don't use your Quest for other things this may not bother you but I found it annoying, however Airlink did work for me with no issues.

before I started playing this game I went through some very helpful tutorials 1) for PC/Quest performance and 2) for Airlink performance.

1) (youtube) 'The Ultimate VR Performance Guide' by AEXLAB
2) (youtube) 'How to play PCVR on Quest 2 in 2023 with Airlink, Virtual Desktop' by VRelity
also (youtube) 'Air Link Setup | Meta Quest 2' by Meta Quest
also (youtube) 'HOW TO PLAY STEAM VR GAMES WIRELESSLY IN MINUTES' by My Tech Gear

Key things for Airlink, turn off your VPN if you have one.  Use a 5G setting on your router.  I'm using a 4 year old Shaw (my ISP) router that has a 2.4Ghz channel and a 5Ghz channel.  I started with the 2.4Ghz channel and had problems but once I switched to the 5Ghz everything ran smooth.  You can also use a USB 3+ type A to type c for a wired connection but understand that it won't charge the headset while you play.  I bought a cheap unbranded type c to c cable off Amazon.ca for $30 (CAD) and it has worked flawlessly for me.  Another tip for the cable is I took 2 small squares of duct tape and close to the PC side I taped the cable to the floor.  When you get flailing around in combat if you pull on the cable the duct tape gives you a bit of a safeguard against ripping it out of the PC.

If there are any negatives for this game and honestly there aren't, I would say that when you reload the pistol, especially in the heat of battle I would bang the 2 controllers together and 50% of the time end up not reloading.  It was frustrating but eventually I did get the hang of things.  The other weird part of the game is when an enemy gets right in your personal space you just seem to die.  There's no close combat and there's no way to really tell what's going on and suddenly you're just dead.  Not really a short coming of the game but more really just VR itself.  There's no haptic feedback to really get a sense of what is going on in this scenario.  You just learn to stay a couple arms length away from enemies.

Thank you Valve,  this game is nothing short of a masterpiece.",1680733809,1680737104,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Amazing game, couple of minor bugs that had no major effect to gameplay.

I think an endless/challenge mode would be really nice to keep playing it more long term but still an amazing game as it is.
