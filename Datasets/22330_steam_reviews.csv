Oblivion is an underbaked 6/10 game with its saving grace being how rich and extensive the lore is. Somehow the game is compelling enough to continue playing until the end, but overall it leaves a lot to be desired. Spongy combat, bad levelling design, and outside of the main cities, the world is bland and dull.

Where the game falls down in a huge way is the quest design is unbelievably heinous. It is standard fare that quests take place over multiple stages, and in a majority of cases, entail heading from one end of the map to the other just to trigger a 30-60 second conversation to be told to do something or go speak to someone else at another location just as far away again. The game makes it too labourous to be enjoyable solely relying on the horse or walking when it can often take 8-15 minutes to travel between the locations you need to get to. So, in the end it’s just far too convenient to fast travel all the time leaving you with an unfulfilling experience.

I’m sure people will get on at me saying, “Ah! But the game is 18 years old!” My response to that is; Morrowind is 4 years older and a better game that wasn’t plagued with the same issue. If you ask me, Morrowind is akin to meeting a girl for the first time and falling in love with each other, and Oblivion is the stage in the relationship where you get married and she begins to let herself go.

I don’t think I could recommend this game to new-comers. Oblivion, shows its age in a bad way and I would find it hard to believe if Bethesda claim they put serious efforts into playtesting. I’ve seen what people have been saying about Starfield since release, and it looks like nothing has really changed for two decades. They’ve extended themselves into a company happy to rest on their laurels because people will lap up anything they release.

Anyway, for me personally, it’s the last time I play an Elder Scrolls game. There’s a reason why people will tell you to mod their games, and if you can be bothered messing around with all that; jump in. Otherwise, don’t bother.",1708995007,1708997479,False,1,1,0.51906663179397583,0,True,False,False

Its main quest is a bit dull, and it abuses in the number of oblivion gates to close, but the world itself is great to explore. It's like, the world was made, and then a main quest was added as an afterthought. So, if you play that game, don't focus too much on the main quest, and explore around instead.
It is obvious today that mods are necessary to really enjoy the game. Especially the NorthernUI and the loot menu, which completely change the interface and makes it way more modern and nicer to play. And of course, the texture overhaul. Once you made the essential mods, you can truly enjoy the game, even in 2024.
Fights are also feeling good. Instead of Morrowind, each of your attacks connect and give damage. 

By the way, I played it on Ubuntu with Proton, and aside from a few crash to desktop, typical of ES games, it worked perfectly well at full speed.

Overall, Oblivion with mods is like a Skyrim in golden-green lands and forests. If Skyrim is themed on winter, then Oblivion is themed on summer.

Played Oblivion for the first time in 2024 and this is my opinion.
GRAPHICS: They are okay, its playable and enjoyable.
LEVELING: You do stuff like running, jumping, hitting, getting hits , spells etc, you sleep and you get leveling points. You go to jail, you lose leveling points. So dont go to jail.
STORY: 10/10 
SIDE QUESTS: 11/10. Have done quite a few of them, and i have found a list on google with all of them ,and i m trying to complete them.
BUGS: Encountered only on in one of the last main quests. Found the solution on google and it was very simple. I have to type a command on the game , and everything was back to normal. Bugs will not ruin your experience.
CONTROLS: Very easy. Played with keyboard and mouse.
MUSIC: Epic. From the battles to roaming the map.

You can walk across water like jesus, you can make your own spells etc. They go out of there way to even place the constellations in the damn sky. They didn't do that with skyrim!

With minimal direction. My first few play through's of oblivion were so exciting as I tried to find all the guilds. Playing through the arena to win my first real money. The accomplishment of buying the first property after saving up. It was such a unique experience. No game has really replicated that. The only thing I wish is that they gave you more options to run the flip side of some of the guilds. Such as the necromancers or the Blackwood company. Though even with out these options, the modding opportunity really gives you a chance to experience these elements and it really opens up that RP side of the game.

The fourth part Oblivion, is my second favorite... I still can't decide which game has a better story, whether Skyrim or Oblivion. You might recognize significant story excerpts from Oblivion in Skyrim.
I also have to praise its soundtrack, which gives the game the right atmosphere.

[h2] Story [/h2]

The game takes place in Cyrodiil in the last days of the Third Era, about 5-6 years after Morrowind. You wake up as a prisoner in the Imperial City, where you meet Emperor Uriel Septim, with the understanding that your cell should be unoccupied.
The Emperor is accompanied by members of the Blades, who accompany him out of the city because he is being targeted for assassination by the Mythic Dawn cult. His sons have long since died. Unfortunately, the group falls into a trap, and the Emperor is killed by the cult's assassin.
Before that, he gives you the Amulet of Kings (an amulet that maintains barriers between the World and Oblivion... assuming it's worn by the Throne's Successor with dragon blood.)
The player receives a task from the Emperor to deliver the Amulet of Kings to Jauffre, Grandmaster of the Blades. Jauffre knows where to find Uriel Septim's illegitimate son.

Jauffre informs the player about the Emperor's son, who is located in Kvatch acting as a priest of the god Akatosh. The player finds Martin, but he agrees to go with Jauffre only if he closes the Oblivion gate that has appeared outside Kvatch, which is currently in ruins.
After the player closes the Oblivion gate, Martin sets out on a journey with them. However, in the meantime, Jauffre has been ambushed by the cult, and the Amulet of Kings has been stolen. Here begins the quest to retrieve the Amulet of Kings, with which Martin Septim can ignite the dragonfires and seal the barriers between Oblivion and Nirn.

[h2] Ratings [/h2]
Oblivion was incredibly enjoyable for me, with its excellent story, gameplay, and soundtrack... Even from a graphical standpoint, the game is beginning to resemble newer generation games, and its gameplay is even better than in previous installments.
Exploring Cyrodiil and delving deeper into The Elder Scrolls lore is truly engaging.

[h1] Recenze TESIV: Oblivion [/h1]

Čtvrtý díl, Oblivion, je můj druhý nejoblíbenější.. doteď se nemohu rozhodnout, která hra má lepší příběh, zdali Skyrim nebo Oblivion. Značné úryvky příběhu z Oblivionu můžete znát z Skyrimu.
Musím taky vychválit její soundtrack, který hře dodává tu správnou atmosféru. 

[h2] Příběh [/h2]
Hra se odehrává v Cyrodilu v posledních dnech třetího věku tuším, že 5-6 let po Morrowindu. Jako vězeň se vzbudíte ve vězení v Císařském městě, kdy se potkáte s Císařem Urielem Septimem, s tím, že vaše cela má být neobsazená.
Císař má doprovod ze společnosti Čepelí, kteří doprovázejí Císaře z města, protože se ho chystá zavraždit kult Bajného úsvitu. Jeho synové jsou v tu dobu dávno po smrti. Bohužel se skupina dostane do pasti a Císař je zabit vrahem kultu.
Před tím, ještě dá Amulet králů (Amulet, díky němuž jsou bariéry mezi Světem a Oblivionem... tedy za předpokladu, že ho má na sobě Následovník trůnu s dračí krví.)
Hráč dostane úkol od Císaře dostat Amulet králů k Jauffremu Velmistrem Čepelí. S tím, že Jauffrem ví, kde najít Nemanželského syna Uriela Septima.

Jauffremu informuje hráče o Synovi císaře, který se nachází ve Kvatchi jakož to kněz boha Akatoshe. Hráč Martina najde, ale půjde s ním za Jauffrem jen za to, že uzavře Bránu Oblivionu, která se zjevila před Kvatchem, který je v tu dobu v Troskách.
Po tom co hráč zavře bránu Oblivionu, tak se s ním Martin vydá na cestu za Jauffrem. Ale mezitím byl Jauffrem napaden kultem a Amulet králů byl ukraden. Zde začíná cesta získat zpět Amulet králů, s jehož pomocí může Martin Septim zapálit dračí oheň a zacelit bariéry mezi Oblivionem a Nirnem.

[h2] Hodnocení [/h2]
Oblivion mě neskutečně bavil, skrze vynikající příběh, hratelnost a jeho soundtrack... Už i z grafické stránky se hra začíná podobat hrám novější generace a její hratelnost je zase o něco lepší než u předchozích dílů.
Člověka pak baví prozkoumávat Cyrodill a více se ponořovat do Lore The Elder Scrolls série.

Wait for a sale. I am talking like below $5. If this was gamestop this shit would be like $3. Besides the price point though, this is from an era when Todd wasn't a walking, talking meme. This edition to TES is the best one imo. Probably not saying Morrowind because I played this one first. Skyrim just doesn't have the replayability that Oblivion has and was too stream-lined for the typical COD enjoyer. If you are a DnD nerd that likes fully voice acted long and branching questlines, this is the game for you(just don't pay attention to all the potato heads). If you are a DnD nerd that is like 45 years old now then Morrowind is probably more of your cup of tea.

I recall hours and hours of just exploring the world, finding all the nooks and crannies, learning all the game had to offer. I probably put over 200 hours on my PS3 playing this.

Even now today I find myself coming back to it. Sure the faces are silly, sure the dialogue is mostly terrible, sure its buggy. But man do I love this game. Graphically its old sure, but the visuals have a somewhat timeless quality to them. Cresting a hill coming out of Chorrol in the early evening and seeing the White Gold tower in the distance will never lose its charm.

If Skyrim was your first elder scrolls game (as im sure it was for many), don't approach this game thinking its going to be some breathtaking modern gaming experience, because you will be disappointing. Approach this game knowing It was made in a time when most games cost less than 50M to make (exact numbers for the budget in this game prove hard to find lol), and computer programming was being done on PCs that weigh more than you average infant. This game was made with passion, and the limited resources it was made with are utilised to the fullest.

Also, main story line in the game is actually good.

The setting is nice, and has some pretty unique and fun side quests. Both of the DLCs are solid, and add interesting stories and characters (especially Shivering Isles). The game does greatly falter when it comes to the main story, cookie cutter dungeon designs, terrible AI and lackluster voice acting, and most of all, the horrendous leveling system that almost requires you to either efficiently level or use mods to fix the leveling.

Knights of the Nine: 6/10. Very short, and if you're not running a heavy armor or one-handed build, the rewards are essentially useless.

Shivering Isles: 7.5/10. Very good DLC that adds a good amount of quests, a great story, and the best character in the game. It has pretty good enemy variety for a DLC, with the only negative being that it's an Oblivion DLC.",1707672809,1707672809,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This time it clicked, so I started playing, and it is just not a good game. Skyrim did what this game should have done, because  despite all of its problem Skyrim is a fun game to play, this isn't. So what's the main problem? Leveling, that is, leveling of the enemy. As you advance, your enemies advance with you, but the problem is, they don't become more stronger, they don't pose more of a challenge, it is just that now they have more health. So what happens is that you will have hit normal enemies 1023929038 times for them to die, and with this combat system, it is tedious. They said level until level 30, than stop, but the problem starts way earlier in the game. It makes no sense to level up, and that should be one of the main focuses of an RPG game. So combat system is, either I will jump around them and pray to god that they don't stagger me, because then animation will start, I won't be able to move, and that will happen 5 times during a normal combat, against one opponent. So what you can do is hit him twice, defend yourself, hit him twice, defend yourself, and now imagine doing this shit with almost every opponent, and there hp is high, it takes ages. I will try to finish the game, but at this point I'm killing only enemies that I absolutely must kill. Because I won't find an item that will change the game if I kill them, nothing I do with weapons matters, because I'm blade master, my strength is 100, endurance is 100, other stats are not 100, but are high enough of a level, goblin with a small sword, knife, ax or something similar attacks me, I need to spend like 3 minutes killing this dude, because I will hit his block with a great sword, he will stagger me, and it's incredibly annoying. Which brings us to weapons that could maybe make your game easier, if it wasn't for a goddamn charging system. Let's say that your sword is charged at 100 and that from every hits it takes 1 energy point from your sword, so when it hits 0, you have to recharge it (doesn't work this way, you will have like 1200 energy, or 3000, or something similar, I'm just using it for simplicity, and it uses more energy per hit, so you lose charge much faster). If I would let's say need 5 hits to kill a normal enemy, and I would lose 5 energy, it wouldn't be a problem, but you will have to hit 1 enemy 100 times, so you will start a battle with fully charged weapon against couple of enemies, and during this battle you will have to recharge weapons 5 times, and then you will have to recharge the stones, find new ones, or develop a different build where you can charge weapons with your power, but it is still tedious work, even if you get that power it won't change for better, because you will still have to recharge it every time. There are other problems, bugs and similar things that come with Bethesda, I could have overlooked that if it wasn't for this leveling up and battle system problems. If you are an masochist, I would recommend this game, if not, and especially if you didn't play it as a kid, I can't recommend it.",1707630027,1707630027,False,2,0,0.434782594442367554,0,True,False,False

1. Awesome Story.
2. Melee Combat can be Compared to Fallout 3.
3. Sheogorath is Goat'd.
 4. Doing quests for gods/statues is cool.
5. So Many Builds.
 6. Environment looks beautiful and enjoyable.
7. Arena has offered more challenge, even after eliminating Agronak gro-Malog, They Give you more Challenging enemies and Coins.
8. The Fight Between Martin and Dagon was cool.
9. Won Game of the Year for 2006.
10. Despite Not having much companions, you can spawn some allies and consider them as ""Companions"" 
11. Can Make your own class.
12. Crusader Armor looks Cool
13. Multiple Player homes but in 2 different categories. 1 in which you play the game regularly and get an house using gold and 2 is to buy the Deluxe Version of this Game. In this case, I think the Deluxe Version is Worth it.
14. Enchanting Stations are rare to find.
15. Character Customization is Fun.



Cons:
-1. Shivering Isles Sucked ASS.
 -2. Shivering Isles to the north is too Colorful and to the south is Swampy and Emo.
-3. It feels like You played for an hour, but in reality you have been playing for 20 minutes. (Don't rlly know if this is a con or not, just felt like it is).
-4.  When you look from a mountain to look down upon Cyrodiil, everything but the imperial city looks like PS1 Graphics. 
-5. The Pilgrims Path is lazy. You Have to find 9 shrines and then Whitestrake will talk to you.
-6. Mehrunes Dagon is an Unkillable ""Boss"" which is why i think he should be an boss fight.    
-7. Mehrunes Dagon is Very Mean.
-8. Hardly any good Boss Fights at all.
-9. Killed off Uriel Septim at the beginning for no Reason.
-10. In order to use the Crusader Armor, you have to Good. This is bad after you complete the Crusader quest line before doing Dark Brotherhood quest line.
-11. Not much cut Content.
-12. Expensive ass house deeds and Stuff you can pay for 2000 Coins each.
-13. Kvatch is attacked For no reason, giving us less of an city to actually live at.
-14. Playing as an Vampire Sucks.







Conclusion: 
This Game is Amazing, and i Hope this Classic Game will never Die.

He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn.
Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.",1707425037,1707425037,True,0,2,0.466926097869873047,0,True,False,False

As with many Bethesda games, Oblivion is known for its bugs and glitches. However, with the installation of 485 mods, the game has been running smoothly with only occasional crashes occurring every 3-6 hours. The only other issue I encountered was with HDR on my monitor, which made dark areas like caves difficult to navigate. Despite my attempts to turn off HDR, the game refused to listen and forced it on. I eventually had to use the console command TLB to make the game playable in these areas.

Just a glance at the game's visuals compared to other early Xbox 360 titles reveals its stunning quality. Its expansive, intricate world is everything you'd expect from an Elder Scrolls game—beautiful, vast, and captivating. Before Skyrim's arrival, Oblivion reigned as the pinnacle of gaming excellence for many, myself included. Even today, it retains its charm and allure.

With the inclusion of two expansion packs, Shivering Isles and Knights of the Nine, the Game of the Year Edition offers over 30 additional hours of gameplay, ensuring long-lasting enjoyment. Personally, I've sunk 180 hours into my character, completing every mission and meticulously exploring every location. Its replay value remains high, prompting me to purchase the original release and later the Game of the Year edition just to delve into the new expansions.

Oblivion GOTY is undeniably addictive, ranking among the finest RPGs I've ever experienced. Until the release of Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim in November 2011, it stands as a beacon of adventure, inviting players to immerse themselves in its richly crafted world of hacking, slashing, and spellcasting. A must-play for RPG enthusiasts, it promises an unforgettable journey through its enchanting realms.",1706531633,1706531633,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

All of the NPC's look like slightly melted GI Joe's which I guess is fine, given the games large scope and that it came out in 2006.

That's another post for another day...

My buddy showed me this game when I spent the night at his house, My life changed after I played this. It was incredibly hard at first, being my first game (same for Fallout 3, at the time), but I overcame it and had so much fun in the painted-looking world. 

This game hits a soft spot in my heart and have loved it since that night I played it. If you haven't play this game, or any TES 1-3, I highly recommend you try it. Morrowind is great start. Arena and Daggerfall are good too, but doesn't necessarily play the same as Morrowind, Oblvion, or Skyrim, but they're great games.

This game IS dated. Yes, it released in 2007. It's old, but it has so much to offer and the world is huge. If you're going to give it a chance for the first time, give it some patience and grace. You'll be thankful you did.

As many may know, this game is a bit dated at this point so graphics and sounds are a bit older and don't have the quality of modern games that people expect. It doesn't detract from the fact that the visuals are decent and the sounds match their visual counterparts. There is sometimes a little bit of lag behind the visuals when sounds come, though.

I feel that the main strength of this game is the gameplay. While it can take a very long time to do, grinding up to maximum power and having the ability to just stomp your opposition or sneak around literally in front of people because your sneak skill is maxed is a ton of fun and really scratches that itch to feel overpowered that many games have gone away from.

One thing that can get a little frustrating is the time it can take to get to a new area, but if that's more of an issue if you are looking for instant gratification. If you are just looking for the adventure of it, this can be a great feature, though. It can even make the game more relaxing. It honestly depends on your mood. 

Oblivion is a great game for anybody that is looking for the adventure that we all see in the movies or read in books but in a more interactive way. There are tons of weapons and armor combinations as well as specialties in skills that fit into anybody's play style.",1706062527,1706062527,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h2]Story[/h2]
Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion opens its gates to a world rich in lore, where the fate of Cyrodiil lies in your hands. With a narrative as expansive as the landscape itself, the game thrusts you into a gripping tale of prophecies, daedric influences, and political intrigue. The story weaves a tapestry of choices, moral dilemmas, and unexpected twists that will leave you questioning alliances and your own moral compass.

From the haunting words of Emperor Uriel Septim VII, ""Close shut the jaws of Oblivion,"" to the enigmatic words of Sheogorath, the Daedric Prince of Madness, the dialogue is a treasure trove of memorable lines. Each character you encounter feels like a piece of a larger puzzle, and your decisions resonate throughout the world, shaping the destiny of Tamriel. The humor is sly and well-placed, providing a welcome respite from the weighty decisions you're forced to make.

[h2]Gameplay[/h2]
Venturing into the heart of Oblivion is a joyous romp through a vibrant and dynamic world. The gameplay is the meat of this epic, offering a sandbox of possibilities. Whether you're casting spells, swinging a sword, or sneaking through the shadows, the controls are intuitive, allowing you to lose yourself in the immersive experience.

The attention to detail is staggering, from the bustling cities to the serene landscapes. Quests are diverse and enthralling, each contributing to the rich tapestry of your character's journey. The radiant AI system ensures that NPCs have lives of their own, creating a living, breathing world that reacts to your choices. The freedom to approach challenges in your own way adds layers of replayability.

In the true spirit of open-world RPGs, Oblivion excels in providing a canvas for emergent storytelling. The unpredictable encounters with wildlife, bandits, or wandering adventurers add spice to your travels. It's a dance of swords and spells, with each confrontation feeling unique and satisfying.

[h2]Graphics[/h2]
While not without flaws, Oblivion's graphics were groundbreaking in their time. The stylized visuals capture the essence of a fantasy realm, and the attention to detail in character models and environments is commendable. Sure, some textures may show their age, but the overall aesthetic charm prevails. The sweeping landscapes of Cyrodiil still manage to evoke a sense of wonder.

Considering its release date, the game's graphics hold up well, especially when you consider the vibrant modding community that has breathed new life into Oblivion's visuals. Mods can transform the game into a breathtaking spectacle, proving that even in the realm of graphics, the modding community is a force to be reckoned with.

[h2]Sound[/h2]
From the haunting melodies of Jeremy Soule's score to the nuanced voice acting, Oblivion's sound design is a symphony that enhances the overall experience. The ambient sounds of the wilderness, the echoes of footsteps in the Imperial City, and the resonant echoes of spells all contribute to a world that feels alive.

Voice acting, a potential pitfall in many games, shines here. The characters' voices convey emotion and personality, making your interactions with them all the more engaging. The soundtrack, with its iconic theme, stays with you long after you've left Cyrodiil. It's a testament to the power of audio in creating an immersive gaming experience.

[h2]Overall[/h2]
Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is a masterpiece that has aged like fine wine. Its narrative depth, expansive gameplay, and enchanting world make it a classic in the RPG genre. While the graphics may show their age, the vibrant modding community ensures that the game can still compete with more modern titles.

Should you embark on this journey into Cyrodiil? Without a doubt. Whether you're a seasoned adventurer or a newcomer to the realm of open-world RPGs, Oblivion offers an unforgettable experience. Lose yourself in the grandeur of Tamriel, let the echoes of Uriel Septim VII guide you, and revel in the madness of Sheogorath.

This was my first ever RPG as a teen as I remember my friends bringing this game to school to show it off. With the leaks about an Oblivion Remake/Remaster plus the Skyblivion mod coming out, I thought it would be a great time to review the original game! Many of Oblivion's aspects can be viewed as outdated to its dungeon design, potato looking character models and its levelling system. Do I care? Not really no. Oblivion is honestly magic and there's no game that has made me want it to explore its world more then this one! But I will dive into these aspects and critique them.

Firstly we have the dungeon design that felt interesting to revisit after Starfield pretty much copy and pasted all of its dungeons imo. This was back when Bethesda was still really small and they only had one developer to make all of the dungeons. Exploring them, I could definitely feel the repetitive nature but again it felt more varied then a certain other game I have already mentioned. That said, the dungeons are definitely one of the weaker aspects. The world exploration is fantastic though as the draw distances look beautiful despite the texture pop in. When you first step out of the dungeon and see the small dock along with the Ayelid ruins in the background. That will always be iconic to me! One quest that also relates to that is ""The Collector"" quest-line which sees you diving into the ruins to find statues for a rich benefactor. I honestly thought that was great and it gives you a reason to dive into them so you can get rich quick!

The levelling system is another thing to critique as it can be broken at times in how you build you're character. I also go for skills like Athletics, no matter what kind of character I'm making since its easy to level up since all you have to do is run around which you will be doing a lot of. Enemies also level with you which can be annoying, when you see a bandit in full ebony armour attack you on the road for 100 gold. That man should be retired at this point! If they do remake oblivion and not just remaster it, like the leak suggests, I feel like this is an aspect they will have to fix!

The music is absolutely amazing and its something I listen to almost every day since it always makes me feel relaxed and calm. The battle music can get a little repetitive, especially when you sink as many hours as I have into this game. The sound design overall is decent but you can definitely see the small team size and not big budget like they would have now. The voice acting also is great, even if they have a small cast voicing all of the NPCs. Me and my sister would always laugh when we would speak to a beggar as they asked us for a coin with an old, tired voice. But then when you asked them rumors their voice would suddenly change and be normal lol

That's a good segue into the dialogue system, which Bethesda took inspiration from for Starfield. It has the infamous zoom into an NPC while the world in the background freezes as you talk to them. I have never really minded that style of interaction and in many ways I prefer that to the more dynamic interaction of Skyrim and Fallout 4, mainly in that you don't get attacked or interrupted mid conversation like the after mentioned games do. The persuasion mechanic would be laughed at today as you basically just recycle a bunch of options like compliment, intimidate etc until the the relationship meter with that NPC is as full as it can get. Me, I have a lot of nostalgia for this mechanic as it again always seemed funny to me how the NPCs reacted to whatever I said to them. In any other game, I would hate this but in Oblivion, I am blissfully happy with it!

Second to last, I wanted to talk about gameplay. The combat is very much just as bad as Skyrim was as Bethesda has just never been good with FPS melee combat. I don't mind it again, but replaying this game made me see how its very bland in how you basically block and then swing to hit, rinse and repeat. I also hate how some enemies can just keep swinging at you even though your hitting them, like theirs no stagger or visual feedback from your hits. This is especially bad in the goblins and also some of the enemies from the Shivering Isles expansion which I will rant about, when I review that. Its also just annoying because you have a stamina bar that runs out, but the enemies just seem to have unlimited stamina. The spells are a cool addition though and I love the enchantments that you can put on your weapons in this game. I just wish their was a way to enchant weapons other then doing the Oblivion gates which get repetitive very quickly. If I were to give a pass on the dungeon design, I will not on the Oblivion Gates, as they are always just confusing to explore and feel very thrown together last minute.

Lastly, the story. The main story is decent in its execution as I like the tale of the Blades trying to protect the emperor against a cult that worship the daedra. It is however still the most forgettable part and it is epic to hear the voices of both Patrick Stewart and Sean Bean as the Emperor and prince respectively. Where the writing does shine though, is in the faction and side quests that are really well done in this game. It definitely made the tedium of dealing with all of the previously mentioned mechanics much more durable. I feel like developers have just put less effort these days into side quests in games and replaying this made me see how much they can add to an open world game. The Fighters Guild and Dark Brotherhood will always be my favourites!

Overall, this review may have read as very jumbled but its just because its hard for me to express how much I love this game! It introduced me to the RPG genre, and it always provided an amazing level of escapism, whenever things IRL became hard for me. I owe a lot to Oblivion and I will happily replay this and any remake, mod or remaster that we get in the future!",1705925070,1705925091,True,24,0,0.6700020432472229,0,True,False,False

It brings together a very cohesive world with side quests that feel like main stories, but there are just so many of them to choose from. Any interaction with any character, whether it be the emperor or a simple peasant can lead to a truly inspiring story, some coming out of nowhere, and some you have to seek out. Finding the prophet in Anvil is one of the most captivating story arcs in the game, and it is found by complete chance when visiting Anvil for the first time. It is a truly fascinating story, and yet it is a simple side quest. There are also the different guilds you can join. The fighters guild for example sends you on quests to help others using you sword, making you a sort of vigilante. Some side quests are so small they only take a few minutes, and even those are packed full of story that keeps you captivated within the world.

From my childhood, it used to scare the crap out of me solely because of the Oblivion Gates. I would not go through them as a kid and therefore couldn't really finish the game. When I got older, about my teenage years, is when I was finally able to finish the game because I was brave enough to go into the gates. 

This game is vastly better than Skyrim and I will die on that hill, all the way from graphics to gameplay to story (music is pretty equivalent). Skyrim really isn't that great as a base game; the community has made it special and amazing via mods. Oblivion is just amazing on it's own. 

I absolutely love the graphics of the game; the bright and colorful painter style of the game is pleasing to some degree. It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I absolutely love them especially compared to vanilla Skyrim's tryhard realistic graphics. The creature designs are just absolutely wonderful as well. 

The gameplay to me is FAR more interesting than Skyrim's simply because spell-crafting was one of the best things that I was able to do. I loved making my own spells in a diegtic and fun way. Joining the Mage's Guild gives you access to creating spells to begin with and sets up an incredible roleplay choice of studying magic enough to the point that you can create your own spells. And WITH those spells you can even enchant your stuff which is super cool! Being able to cast magic WHILE holding a sword allowed for a real nice battlemage playstyle which I love. Skyrim took away those aspects and kinda made me not like their gameplay that much. 

The story is just much better. I am a sucker for stories where you are not the hero, you're just some guy. Throughout the entire game, you are not the chosen one, there is not some mystical being that has just given you these ultimate powers and stuff. You fight through a prison, become a free person with one mission: bring the Amulet of Kings to Jauffre and find the last heir of the Empire. It's true you can become super powerful and you're the one shutting the Oblivion Gates, but you weren't graced with some power by the gods. That just comes from your capability. Questing in this game is a lot more fun too and honestly, I think there are more funny moments in Oblivion than there are in Skyrim. 

I really think people should play Oblivion and experience probably one of the best TES games. It's super fun and just a great game to go through.",1705380125,1705380125,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I was on my fourth draft when I realized that the reason my rant wasn't getting short enough for Steam's dainty review criteria was due to me simply listing what changes the series had undergone from Morrowind. That alone pushed me into the 10k character count.

	So, I suppose that the only way to even try to approach this is on the game's own terms, limiting both comparisons to what came before, as well as gauges against its sequels and spiritual successors in hindsight. I have to understand what the devs were going for, decide whether they accomplished it, and most importantly, decide whether the result is worthwhile.
	How do I begin, though? Everyone already knows this series.

	TES IV: Oblivion was released right on the cusp of the ""HD era,"" before developers had truly figured out the realism that many titles strove for later in the life of the Xbox 360 and PS3; At this point, everything from that time looks dated, that wasn't at least drenched in some peculiar style to make up for its inevitable shortcomings, but the earliest to the party still manage to look the most... off.

	Oblivion is no exception to this rule, especially considering its scale. It's beautiful from a distance, but jagged and rough up close. Cyrodiil's beautiful hills and mountains are covered in forests and other foliage that seem to grow with your approach. Pristine castles and elaborate houses of clean wood and sharp stone sit abruptly on patches of waxy wilderness, with no effort to blend their points of contact, or make it look like anything other than a Lego set placed on astroturf. Even the dirt looks clean. Medieval fantasy towns of somewhat believable size are populated by a wide array of Dr. Seuss characters: potato-faced elves, beardless Nords, and Khajiit resembling fursuits made on a two-digit budget.

	Speaking of looks, the look of your character's equipment, a reflection of your level, will feel limited in the late game. High-tier heavy armor loses out to high-tier light armor when your light armor skill is maxed out, and there just aren't many of either.
	Most variety in fashion is found not in the armors, but in the clothing that takes up the same slots, which is still lacking. Single-item outfits will supplant several equippable items to make you a visually boring amorphous blob, while some items display differently depending on the sex of your character. (I, for one, liked my man-skirt in Morrowind.) Fewer equippable items means fewer options for constant effect enchantments, and just overall less depth... but then, that is the overarching theme of this game.

	Particularly with the actual RPG mechanics, that missed depth is on display. The 21 skills on offer are distributed equally among your attributes, and weighed equally when it comes time to determine what bonuses you get when you level up, which is frustrating seeing as how all skills are obviously not equally useful. You're *encouraged* to max out Endurance as soon as possible, as the exponential health gain benefit between levels is that much more exponentially punishing to delay; The other attributes, there isn't much long-term penalty for ignoring, and I ask, ""Why deny myself the extra health if I'm going to max out whatever my favored attributes are and have to branch out into Endurance anyway?""

	The world and its challenges are very much scaled to the player, right down to many of the enemies and quest rewards. On one hand, this often allows you to plow right into the content most suited for your character (or just whatever you want to do first) without regard for whether you'll be underpowered for the upcoming challenge. On the other hand, it means that items obtained earlier on, that would've been permanently useful if acquired later, are instead doomed to become obsolete. So, in essence, the game encourages a more counterintuitive behavior; Avoid doing the quests for the items you know you want until you're sure you'll get the best versions of those items.

	Strangely, the quests mostly feel built to accommodate that sense of postponement. Their associated persons exist basically in their own isolated bubbles for their one quest, apart from maybe being regular merchants or guards, but nothing more. Again, calling back to Morrowind, many characters existed in what was more of a web of quests. They could become your best friends, keep you at arm's length, or die by your hand. It was still empowering to the player, but gave choice and result.
	Here, though, you're only supposed to scratch the surface, and nothing more. The scale of the game was kept similar, but there's just less to it.

	The factions share the same sense of isolation, and apart from the Thieves Guild, they don't really step on one another's toes or interact with each other. You can join every faction in one playthrough, and be the head of each simultaneously. They exist primarily as vehicles for their own questlines, atop one or two little perks each, rather than as extensions of your character's class and identity. These are very much ""do or delay"" scenarios, at your convenience, often in the manner of your choosing. Most of them play out in only one fashion, unless you do something stupid and get kicked out, which usually requires you to intentionally go out of your way. It's not that you can do anything; It's that you're supposed to do EVERYTHING, often without consequence, and there's a serious lack of immersion as a result, NPCs daily routines notwithstanding. There's rarely any sense of risk or urgency in the vast majority of this experience.

	You have to realize, though, that most of these design decisions were clearly intentional. This was either never meant to be immersive, or, if it was, then the overly generous world that seems built to revolve around the player undermines it at every turn. It's a series of short bursts of fun, at the cost of a believable world and any long-term satisfaction that comes from building up the type of character you wanted to play, a class-based RPG that seems to resent its class system at every turn.

	TES IV: Oblivion is an entertaining title, one that every ARPG fan should play once, and even that one playthrough is worth the price. Beyond that, though, it's also the most poignant shift in its series into a bland, utterly player-subservient direction. Its influence is more due to its quirkiness left over from its predecessors than the depth of its gameplay. Subsequent playthroughs feel less like I'm spending time in a fantasy world, and more like I'm dissecting a fantasy stage production where I'm the main character. Part of me knows that no matter what sort of character I create, it's usually going to end up in the exact same place, not because I want it, but because that's how the game was designed. Yet, even their journeys are only as different as a five-lane highway. Even in one lane, you can basically see what the others see.",1705227058,1705227058,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

PROS:
-A beautifully crafted world
-Cities actually feel like cities with dozens of people living in them, each one with their own schedules, families, friends, jobs, talk to each other (way better than in Skyrim)
-A very good main storyline
-Likeable NPCs
-Some good side quests
-Some armors and weapons looks are just *kiss* perfect
-Lockpicking is a not awesome but solid system

CONS:
-It wouldn't be a Bethesda game if it didn't had the lamest, stalest, dullest, boring and broken combat system you can imagine.
-The looks... Why did they do that..? Horrible. Characters, the vast majority of armors, clothing and weapons are just ugly. Ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly...
-Sadly, again the writing is not thyere yet. Many quests make no sense in-universe, like how a Daedric Prince would grant an extremely powerful artifact created with their own essence to an unknown non worshiper for a random task that isn't even  dificcult? Answer: poor writing.

Oblivion was a game that exploded child me's brain as a kid, and I've put an unspeakable amount of time into it (mostly back on 360)

Going back to it as an actual human being though makes you realized just how incredibly messed up this game is in many aspects. I WOULD NOT PLAY THIS GAME UNMODDED. The combat is a pool noodle fighting simulator with some basic rps sometimes, the world scales like a shonen manga that's way past its prime and sucks at power scaling, and the worst yet, the leveling system that promotes playing like you have paranoid schizophrenia or just accepting you can never sleep again or risk waking up in a world where everything is the same but the local cancer ridden mutts down the street can now mating press your mom and steal your lunch money in front of you and you can't do a thing to stop them. 

What I'm saying is, not even counting bugs, the game's basic systems are broken in game ruining ways. 
However, it you're not a coward and just mod the game, stuff can get wacky and extremely fun. Curing Oblivion of its many plagues unlocks a silly little dungeon crawler that has a lot of charm and great character expression. The main story and factions are generally quite good, and when dungeons aren't just walk in straight line and turn around, feel quite good.

For the DLC, Shivering Isles is basically Oblivion Pokemon Platinum where you get to go the the based realm to crazyland where the Little Caesars only sell 'Normal' Bread. It's fantastic, 
Knights of the Nine is just a really cool faction quest added in, also very very good.
Everything else can familiarize themselves with the wrinkles of my nether region. 

I remember only having SI and KotN on X Box 306, so I never had any of these honkey DLCs like horse armor or the DLC houses that make it where you can instantly become a gorillionaire demigod. 
I hate in mods where you spawn in and instantly you're the heir of Versailles and Epstein Island, but I never realized the origin of this annoying trope would be Bethesda themselves. 

Tl:dr:tl:dr Oblivion is the weird middle child between Morrowind and Skyrim, but I think it's quite fun and interesting as long as you mod it to not be CBT.",1542910983,1704871202,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pra um jogo de 2007 é bem complexo, o sistema de ""level up"" e ""Efficient leveling up"" é capaz de confundir os novos jogadores, entretanto é possível baixar um mod onde o sistema de upar de level volta ao normal.

É incrível que, toda cidade tenha suas características, cada uma é única, completamente diferente das outras, acredito que isso seja um zelo que poucos jogos possuem hj em dia. Cada interior tem a sua decoração, com seus items, decoração e por ai vai.

Você também tem uma liberdade absurda pra fazer qualquer tipo de build, Guerreiro, Mago, Stealth e várias outras, nesse quesito a criatividade de quem joga é o limite.

As músicas são um tanto repetitivas e chega num ponto que fica chato de ouvir, embora, seja bem feita e bem ""imersiva"".  

O jogo entretanto é repetitivo, as dungeons, cavernas e acampamentos fazem o jogo ficar um tanto massante. No começo pode até ser divertido e suscitar essa vontade de explorar o mapa mas a longo prazo fica chato.

A customização de personagem é ok pra um jogo da época, não acredito que seja complexa mas também não é tão simples assim.

A interação com personagens é divertida e imprevisível o que adiciona um tom de humor

Em relação a DLC: Não recomendo comprar nenhuma além da Frostcrag Spire e a que habilita Sundercliff watch.

Eu daria 8.9/10 pra Oblivion, não é um jogo que eu jogaria denovo, mas guardo com bastante carinho

My Apologies, my testy-ness has nothing to do with the fact that Oblivion GOTY edition is a 10 out of 10 video game STILL, just to do with the impossibility of modding any games simply to have some fun. Unfortunate, Really makes me wanna get a couple consoles in the future at some point cuz having this amazing rig I have along with having a well built gaming PC was suppose to provide that sorta thing for my and other folks gaming experience... simply not true. OH WELL, Thank the Lord this game along with its DLCs does more for me than most modern games... from of all game genres, studios, etc etc",1704544473,1704544473,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Many folks will not agree with me, choosing Skyrim or Morrowind instead. I grew up playing Daggerfall, and Oblivion is the closest Bethesda ever came to capturing a sense of scale and freedom close enough to Daggerfall but in a modern way. Oblivion is full of great ideas, charm, discovery. I love its weird clunky UI, its side quests, DLC, progression systems. Skyrim is far too cleaned up in its systems to me, and I found myself incredibly bored with it.

-forgettable main quest
-braindead AI
-massive retcon of the setting (LotR had come out recently around its release and suddenly Cyrodil is no longer a jungle as previous games had mentioned)
-clunky combat, especially spellcasting (fuck you if you wanna have more than 1 spell at the ready, right? Just kidding, you're gonna be a stealth archer anyway)
-character models have aged terribly and look like wood carvings of people
-byzantine menus

So why the recommendation?
-Oblivion is the all time champ for most unintentionally entertaining games. Just watching the aforementioned AI spiral into absolute chaos from something unremarkable or get locked into surreal conversations with each other still makes me laugh. 
-I'm a sucker for a good OST
-I love the look of the menus and UI, even if they're arranged poorly. 

If you catch it on sale, you will absolutely get $5-10 worth of entertainment.

This game holds a very fond place in my memory. It was the first open-world RPG I ever played. Back in 2007 when I was 15, I didn't understand English very well. I bought a guidebook translated into Thai a month before I even got the game. I read the guidebook cover to cover, but even in Thai, I didn't understand much of what was going on. Eventually, I got the game two weeks later and started playing. I was totally hooked on the game world. There were many enjoyable moments in the game, and it's also where I started to understand English a bit more.

I played as a Khajit Warrior proficient in both melee and ranged combat. I still remember looting everything I could find, getting the 33 all-element damage staff, then going to kill Umbra to obtain the best sword. I rushed through the Brotherhood questline to get Shadowmere, then found a forest camp to farm melee and ranged skills on Shadowmere. After that, I focused on restoration until I maxed out the three main stats at 10 before I slept to level up. I remember doing that in a bandit camp somewhere across from Leyawiin. Then I completed tons of quests, and when I almost reached the max level, I continued the Mage Guild questline to create custom spells. That's when I started using cheat codes because the spells I wanted to try used way too much magicka. I ended up with a character with 200 in all stats and a spell that let me run on water, making the game feel ridiculously fun. By the time I started playing the main quest, my character was already way too overpowered. All of this remains a very fond memory.

This game was also a stepping stone for me to start working in an international company and led me to pursue my graduate degree here in the US. It's where I began to grasp the English language, along with Fallout 3. The latter game also got me into a bit of modding and programming.

I'm 31 now and still can't believe how much this game has affected my life. My life wouldn't be like this if I hadn't played this game and if my parents hadn't allowed me to.

All the best,

It does have a unique culture in the world, and is a unique story and experience, and helps explain some of the lore and does some worldbuilding, however, it feels very forgettable as compared to Skyrim and Morrowind, and you could skip over Oblivion in favor of either of the other two. Oblivion has plenty of meme potential and some good moments, with a final mainline quest moment that is more epic than possibly any moment in Skyrim. I do wish it was more dynamic like Morrowind or had more features such as Skyrims smithing/mining systems, but its definitely a complete game and theres a lot of hours of content to enjoy here. However, it personally doesnt appeal much and I often just forget what I was doing in the game when I boot it up with the feeling that I could move on from this title and not miss out on much.

Let us embark on this epic journey into the realm of disappointment, where even the most fervent defenders of this overrated title might find it hard to ignore its glaring flaws.

First and foremost, let's talk about the groundbreaking graphics that Oblivion flaunted upon its release. Oh, how marvelous it was to witness the characters' faces that looked like they had been sculpted by a blindfolded toddler with Play-Doh! Truly, the creators of this game must have decided that realism was overrated and opted for a more avant-garde approach to character design. Who needs facial expressions when you can have a cast of characters resembling a bizarre masquerade ball gone horribly wrong?

And let's not forget the awe-inspiring landscapes that were ahead of their time – if you happen to consider flat, textureless fields and awkwardly placed trees to be the epitome of artistic achievement. The sheer audacity to present such lackluster visuals as a triumph in open-world design is a testament to the game's commitment to underwhelming its audience.

Now, let's delve into the riveting narrative, a tale so captivating that it might as well be a textbook on insomnia. The main questline, featuring the illustrious protagonist known as the Hero of Kvatch, is a rollercoaster of excitement that somehow manages to be as predictable as the changing of the seasons. Save the world from impending doom? Groundbreaking. It's almost as if the writers pulled a generic fantasy plotline from a hat and decided to roll with it.

And let's not overlook the enthralling characters that populate this vibrant world – from the stoic and forgettable knights to the wooden and lifeless elves, each one a masterpiece in uninspired dialogue and lackluster voice acting. It's as if the developers went out of their way to ensure that players would form no emotional connection whatsoever with the denizens of Cyrodiil.

Combat, oh what a joy! The fluidity of movement, the precision of strikes – it's like watching a ballet where everyone involved is stumbling over their own feet. The sublime joy of engaging in combat is only heightened by the erratic AI, which seems to alternate between bouts of genius and downright idiocy. Who wouldn't want to face off against enemies with the strategic acumen of a confused chicken?

But let's not forget the pièce de résistance – the leveling system. A stroke of sheer brilliance, or perhaps madness, that rewards players with the profound experience of facing increasingly powerful enemies as their own skills stagnate. It's a design choice that can only be described as avant-garde – a term we'll use liberally throughout this review to mask the glaring issues.

In conclusion, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is a shining example of a game that managed to capture the hearts of players through the sheer force of nostalgia goggles. If you have a penchant for masochism and an insatiable desire to experience a fantasy world that's less immersive than a puddle, then by all means, indulge in the delight that is Oblivion. But for those who prefer their gaming experiences to be something more than a trip down memory lane, perhaps it's best to leave this relic of a bygone era in the dusty annals of gaming history.

* Dialogue is anything but natural
* Graphics are dated to put it nicely

Overall Outlook:

* 10/10 Would suggest picking up this game to play. I first played this game on my Xbox 360 about a year or two after it's original release. Fell in love with all of it's quirky characters, missions, enemies, environments, and bugs. Sure it's goofy but it makes for great fun and a relaxing play through. I love the game because I can screw around and just decompress. And if I really want to, I can just walk around and appreciate the landscapes in the game. It is an old game but there is a lot to admire about it. The dungeons and traps are way more unique and actually scary at times compared to that one game (Skyrim). Don't get me wrong, Skyrim is visually appealing in numerous ways. But in terms of game-play, I have always preferred Oblivion. Maybe it's the bugs and the finicky fighting.

The one game that should have never had horse armor to begin with, and what I see as the start of a terrible DLC practice.

This was my first Elder Scrolls game, and I absolutely ADORED it, I also heavily wanted to add MORE to the world, and that's where I started to dabble in mapmaking and modding (along side of Half Life and their tools as well, with the actor lipsyncing and all)

But since this game is now SUPER cheap, and the price reflects better than any other CoD game, it's worth it to buy the GoTY edition or Deluxe.

As always though, I recommend watching a few videos to make sure this kind of game works for you. It's not as pretty as it once was, but it still plays well, the mercantile system is unique. It doesn't hold a candle to Skyrim, but the region and sprucing it up with some mods may work well in your favor.

I do recommend Oblivion, but I can't help but see the potential if Bethesda had improved on some of the systems from Morrowind instead of deleting them outright.

My first contact with TES was with Morrowind like in 2006 or something and I would only return to the franchise again after Skyrim was released which made me replay Morrowind and then finally beat skyrim for the first time when I got a better pc back in 2012, which meant I had this gap in the middle, that I never played oblivion, so I played it like almost a decade ago and I never got it on steam because I never cared about getting it here, even tho I already had skyrin and morrowind, recently on a sale I got it for cheap.

To start with the review, Oblivion is a complicated case, compared to other TES games, I feel like its the one that has the biggest personality, maybe it wasnt made on purpose but whenever I see the characters talking in the middle of a town, the zoom in their ugly faces, this followed with the more colorful nature of the game which is a lot brighter than skyrim or morrowind, it just makes this game feel funny and despite playing this one after Morrowind and Skyrim pretty much years ago, I still found it fun to play and enjoyed its more fast paced combat system, it felt sometimes even more fluid than skyrim, however the more I played the more I lost interest...

Despite the more colorful visuals that I prefer over than morrowind and skyrim, cyrodiil is the most boring location out of all 3 I mentioned before, despite having a great capital city, the map of Oblivion doesnt give me the same desire to explore it especially with its very weird difficult mode with scaling enemies, the story here about gates of hell opening everywhere isn’t that interesting either, I felt like the game was lacking a central villain like Dagoth Ur or Alduin, Mehrunes isn’t as interesting as them and the way the conflict against him is resolved is lame, the overall closure of the game is very disappointing, I do like the soundtrack of this one the best, however since Cyrodiil didn’t give me that awe that morrowind or skyrim did as locations, a disappointing main story mode and weird difficult aspects the game had, turns out I only did a few stuff outside the main quest which was like a dozen sidequests, all oblivion gates closed and no participation in any guild, when the main story left me with an off feeling I just wanted to get over the game.

However besides all this personal experience, I think Cyrodiil didn’t hook me because maybe I already had experience Morrowind and Skyrim before so Oblivion didn’t had much to offer that felt more unique compared to those two games, Im sure with some mods certain issues can be fixed as any Bethesda game, but I for me its the weakest of the 3 mainline 3d elder scrolls game but still definitely one of the best rpgs of its decade and how cheap it is now, definitely worth getting.

Oblivion isn't just a game; it's an immersive experience that I couldn't get enough of, even faking illness for a 20-day gaming binge. 

The story, character interactions, and combat are on another level, encompassing everything done well in role-playing games. What makes Oblivion stand out is its sheer magnitude, complexity, and attention to detail. It's a rare gem that elevates the Elder Scrolls series, addressing the shortcomings of its predecessor, Morrowind.

The game starts just as every other Elder Scrolls' title: creating a character being held as prisoner. This time we are prisoners in the Imperial City, in Cyrodiil. During the escape of the emperor Uriel Septim VII, he gets murdered, but before his death he gives us a task of finding the heir to the throne. And so, our adventure begins. 

Just like I said time ago with Morrowind, it can look kind of outdated technically playing, and no wonder: it's a game released in 2006, as one of the first Xbox 360/PS3 titles. Still, it's playable and enjoyable, with many missions to play, characters to meet and many places to explore.

The aspect that might have aged badly is the graphic style, since the characters lack of good facial expressions with some goofy faces. Still, the enviroments aged well, with a good looking landscape, cities, etc... 

And the soundtrack? Incredible. Personally it's not my favourite in the saga, but I still like it. The voice acting might be kinda weak tho.

I would wait for sales to buy the games. The full price of the game is 15€, which considering the hours of gameplay it's not that expensive, but buying it for 3,74€ (or 5€ the deluxe edition) can hurt less to your wallet.

Has a few cons though. Mainly its leveling system, which sucks ass because as you level up your enemies see their stats boosted until they become big annoying HP sponges.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Having embarked on my journey through The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion 16 years ago, it remains a timeless classic that holds a special place in my gaming soul. While some may scoff at its aging graphics and UI, I find solace and charm in their simplicity, evoking a sense of nostalgia. The diverse landscapes, from majestic mountains to mysterious marshes, create a fantasy canvas that continues to surprise and awe. The guild quests, especially the Dark Brotherhood, steal the show with their narrative brilliance, making them a shining example of gaming storytelling. Oblivion's open world is a living, breathing entity, where every decision resonates in a vibrant tapestry of consequences, creating an immersive odyssey that transcends mere gaming. In an age of hyper-realistic visuals, Oblivion's unique beauty lies in its simplicity, allowing the imagination to fill in the gaps.

It's one of my primary gripes with FO3 and I can just barely tolerate it to enjoy FNV. No amount of mods can deal with the fact that playing the games on this engine just doesn't feel good. Morrowind at least has the benefit of being jank in a fun way, like Daggerfall.

Anyways, when I first played the game I liked what the game tried to do, and there's plenty of quests that are interesting and dialogue that is fun, but now that I've experienced (almost) the whole series (fuck Arena), this game is honestly really disappointing. It's more of a generic fantasy game more than an Elder Scrolls game, and in terms of gameplay it's straight up just poorly designed. The way the scaling works makes me think no QA tester actually played through the whole game with one character, and it got rid of all of the interesting RPG mechanics that help make Daggerfall and Morrowind fun while not being a satisfying FPS/TPS experience like Skyrim can be.

Overall, I think it's the worst offering in the series (except Arena).

Unfortunately, I have experienced a bug on this version that makes it nearly unplayable in my opinion. Whenever the audio changes, the game pauses for about 8 seconds every time. This might not sound too annoying on paper, but considering that the audio changes whenever you enter or exit combat (which is almost constantly) and you have to wait 8 seconds for the game to process the audio change, every, single, time, it gets quite annoying. I have tried changing the audio codecs and every other thing I could think of to remedy the problem, but nothing works.

My first taste of Bethesda magic came through with Skyrim when i was 12. Spending well over a hundred hours running around from dungeon to dungeon. City to city. Conquering dragon after dragon. Surely, going back to their previous title was going to do nothing but disappoint me. Skyrim's graphics were borderline dated for their time already. And the floaty melee combat would simply be more exaggerated. So surely, I wouldn't be able to spend more than an hour in Cyrodiil before calling it a day... right? 

Bethesda worked its magic again. I found myself falling in love and immersed in yet another world. Hell, who better than to welcome me into it all than [i]Patrick Stewart[/i] himself as [i]Emperor Uriel Septim VII[/i]. Thrust into another grand adventure upon escaping prison - the world became my oyster and I was sucked in for 100+ hours. 

Combat is as you expect of a Bethesda title, even as I write this at the end of 2023. Weightless and rather janky at times - especially if you're more focused on melee based builds. I've always enjoyed being somewhat of a battle mage myself; Trusty sword in one hand and some combat based spells in the other. Always a great combo to go for with the amount of effects you can conjure forth and rain down on your enemies. Dare I say, I found myself enjoying questing more so here than I did with Skyrim at the time. The Shivering Isles DLC certainly left a good mark on me. Although I certainly do miss the organic and seamless Dragon battles that occurred in Skyrim - the feeling of badassery is felt more there for sure. 

Presentation leaves lots to desire too I'm afraid. This is a badly dated title. Running on the Gamebryo engine - if you thought Bethesda's current Creation Engine iterations are dated and bothersome. This isn't going to be changing your mind anytime soon. The facial animations and apparent use of 4 or 5 voice actors across Cyrodiil is rather incredible. Not in the best of ways - but at least in a funny way.

Perhaps it's the music and soundtrack then that all came together to provide me with such a chill and pleasant time in Cyrodiil. The world and vibe is reflected incredibly well through its sounds. There's a reason there are memes to this day referring to real life, ""Oblivion Dialogue"" , set to the sounds of this game. It just works so well with awkward social encounters apparently. But it just endears me to the title further. I might even prefer the main theme over Skyrim's. There's something about the [b]GRAND[/b] nature of it all - being here at the Emporer's calling and request to defend a nation against impending doom. Rising up as a Champion. 

I adored the time I had spent addicted to saving Cyrodiil from Oblivion. While Bethesda may have lost some luster with fans nowadays - the rumoured remaster of Oblivion will certainly quell some negativity...",1701979079,1701979280,True,24,1,0.739613592624664307,0,True,False,False

It has the love and care of Morrowind, and it is only slightly harder to understand than Skyrim. You could easily make it a simple game if you don't want to go into the more complex mechanics, but it feels so rewarding to play tactically as a mage or rouge.

Edit: Recalling the detail of lore in Morrowind, it is certainly lacking, but Oblivion doesn't gut the core philosophy of ES. In my opinion, Skyrim feels more like a quicker rpg than it's predecessors. The class choices you make are far more important than Skyrim, but not as fleshed out as Morrowind. I remember how in love I was with Skyrim because it did feel like a freshened up world of ES. As time goes on and I watched more videos on these games though, I feel like starting in Oblivion you can feel the old philosophy drifting away if you'll forgive the metaphor. Skyrim wants you to be a hero, Oblivion wants you to be a person who becomes a hero, and Morrowing casts you in a wholly different light while still using the motif of ""Chosen Hero"".",1700805042,1701828517,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, released in 2006, remains a cornerstone in the world of open-world RPGs. Developed by Bethesda Game Studios, this installment in the iconic Elder Scrolls series has left an indelible mark on the gaming landscape. Over a decade since its release, Oblivion stands as a testament to the timeless appeal of its expansive world, immersive storytelling, and groundbreaking gameplay mechanics.

[h2]Visual and Artistic Brilliance:[/h2]
Oblivion's visual presentation is a triumph that has stood the test of time. The game's rendition of the diverse landscapes of Cyrodiil, from bustling cities to dense forests, is a testament to the meticulous attention to detail by the developers. While the graphics may not match contemporary standards, the artistry embedded in each location remains captivating. The architectural diversity of cities, the atmospheric effects, and the intricate design of characters and creatures contribute to a visually rich and compelling game world.

[h2]Immersive Storytelling:[/h2]
At the heart of Oblivion lies a narrative of epic proportions. The looming threat of Oblivion Gates and the resurgence of the Daedric Prince Mehrunes Dagon serve as a compelling backdrop to the player's journey. However, what truly elevates Oblivion's storytelling is the depth and complexity of its side quests. Players find themselves entangled in a web of intrigue, moral dilemmas, and unexpected twists, fostering a sense of agency that few games achieve. The world feels alive not just through grand events but also through the intricacies of individual stories woven into its fabric.

[h2]Dynamic Gameplay and Customization:[/h2]
Oblivion's gameplay mechanics set a high standard for open-world RPGs. The flexibility of character customization through an intricate skill and leveling system allows players to tailor their experience to their preferred playstyle. The Radiant AI system, though imperfect, introduced a dynamic element to NPC behavior, making interactions within the game world unpredictable and immersive. The vast array of spells, weapons, and skills further adds to the richness of player choice, creating a truly open-ended experience.

[h2]Unforgettable Audio Design:[/h2]
Jeremy Soule's evocative musical score is a standout feature, enhancing every moment of the player's journey. The haunting melodies and ambient sounds seamlessly blend with the game's atmosphere, creating an emotional resonance that lingers long after the game is turned off. The attention to detail in sound design, from the rustle of leaves in the wind to the distant roar of creatures, contributes significantly to the immersive quality of the gaming experience.

[h2]Enduring Legacy and Modding Community:[/h2]
Beyond its initial release, Oblivion's enduring legacy is sustained by its vibrant modding community. The game's open framework and modding tools have empowered a dedicated community of creators to expand and enhance the experience continuously. From graphical enhancements to entirely new questlines, the modding scene ensures that Oblivion remains a living, breathing world that evolves with the creativity of its player base.

[h2]Conclusion:[/h2]
In conclusion, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is more than a game; it is a milestone in the evolution of open-world gaming. Its enduring visual appeal, immersive storytelling, dynamic gameplay, and unforgettable audio design combine to create an experience that resonates with players across generations. Oblivion's influence on the gaming industry is undeniable, and its continued relevance is a testament to its status as a timeless classic in the RPG genre. Whether revisiting the world of Cyrodiil or stepping into it for the first time, players are bound to discover an adventure that transcends the boundaries of conventional gaming.",1701425665,1701425665,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

There's still something magical however about stepping out into the rolling hills and dense forests of Cyrodiil. 

Oblivion also marks the beginning of a shift to a more console-friendly form of RPG, but that doesn't mean it's without depth; instead it offers an engaging blend between action-based combat and stat management. Levelling up remains a contentious problem in Oblivion as enemies scale with you, and yet it's also still a lot of fun to dawdle and take your time regardless. It remains a world filled with wonder and adventure regardless of the quirks, and one I still love to return to.

[h2] Oblivion is a great but really funny fantasy RPG [/h2]
- Unlike Skyrim Oblivion is probably what I would call more of an RPG than Skyrim and I honestly wish Skyrim had added the more classic class system from Oblivion or Morrowind to the game. Call me old fashioned but in Morrowind and Oblivion you are really weak and I mean really weak when you start the game, you can fight sure but I like how little Morrowind and Oblivion holds your hand in comparison to Skyrim. Do I think you should play Oblivion? absolutely! I am gonna give it a go when I am done with my skyrim run. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGhlg4JqvQw
- Oblivion is a great game honestly, I think it is worth it and honestly I am gonna give a pretty unpopular opinion now, I enjoyed it way more than Skyrim. Yes, I deserve hellfire I get it and I am truly sorry but Oblivion was just awesome :)

Age of Aggression lyrics

We drink to our youth, for the days come and gone
For the age of aggression is just about done
We'll drive out the Stormcloaks and restore what we own
With our blood and our steel we will take back our home

Down with Ulfric, the killer of kings
On the day of your death we will drink and we'll sing
We're the children of Skyrim, and we fight all our lives
And when Sovngarde beckons everyone of us dies
But this land is ours and we'll see it whiped clean
Of the scourge that has sullied our hopes and our dreams

Down with Ulfric, the killer of kings
On the day of your death we will drink and we'll sing
We're the children of Skyrim, and we fight all our lives
And when Sovngarde beckons everyone of us dies

[h2] Rating: ★★★★★ (5/5) [/h2]



I have been a fan of the Elder Scrolls series for years, and Oblivion truly lives up to its reputation as one of the greatest fantasy RPGs of all time. With its captivating lore, immersive world, and incredible gameplay, this game has kept me hooked for countless hours.

Firstly, the world of Cyrodiil is breathtakingly beautiful and diverse. From dense forests to vast plains and grand cities, each location is meticulously crafted with stunning visual details. Exploring the land feels like a genuine adventure, and uncovering hidden dungeons and quests adds an extra layer of excitement.

Character customization in Oblivion is another highlight. The game provides an extensive range of race, class, and skill options, allowing players to tailor their character to their desired playstyle. The leveling system is well-balanced, enabling a genuine sense of progression as you develop your abilities and gain new spells or abilities.

Furthermore, the main questline is captivating and engaging. The story of the protagonist's journey to close the gates of Oblivion and overcome the Daedric invasion is richly woven with unexpected twists and turns. The supporting characters are memorable, each with their own unique personalities and quirks. Side quests are equally captivating, making every corner of the game world worth exploring.

In terms of gameplay mechanics, Oblivion strikes the perfect balance between accessibility and depth. Combat feels satisfying and responsive, while the spellcasting system allows for endless possibilities. The AI is noticeably improved compared to its predecessors, making encounters with enemies or NPCs feel more realistic and challenging.

Lastly, the modding community for Oblivion is incredible. With thousands of user-created mods available, you can extend your gaming experience even further. From enhanced graphics and new quests to gameplay tweaks and additional content, the modding scene keeps the game fresh and exciting, even after years of its release.

Overall, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is a true masterpiece that has stood the test of time.

You could skip the graphic mods if you want but the stability ones are crucial.  

Otherwise it shows its age both in technical and some gameplay aspects due to how unstable it runs and the incredible amount of bugs it has when you don't use at least 3 or 4 different patches.

Don't get me wrong, it was a great game back then.  And it still is perhaps one of the best RPGs ever done,

An amazing cast of voice actors, including Sean Bean, Terence Stamp, Wes Johnson, and my favorite Patrick Stewart as Uriel Septim. I remember seeing the trailer come out and it revealed the beautiful landscape along with Patrick Stewart narrating in the background to the tune of this amazing sound track. I was blown away. I've been playing this game for years and I keep coming back because it's so enjoyable. 

Pros - Amazing soundtrack

- Voice acting

- A multitude of different class set-ups that are all viable

- Some of the best guild quests in any ES game (most notably the darkbrotherhood, which is my favorite part of this game hands down.)

- Huge sprawling world that I've yet to completely explore in my 10 plus years of playing this

- I believe it was the first game where you can retrieve your arrows from the environment.

- Huge cities where you can buy property 

- The lower fantasy setting, which I find to be more immersive 

- Being able to cast and have any weapon equipped, most notably a bow for those types of builds

- Many interesting characters 

- Amazing side quests 



Cons

- Actual combat leaves a lot to be desired, yet it has some redeemable factors considering how many different build style you can use.

- Bugs and glitches 

- Oblivion gates are dull and repetitive

- Small voice acting cast for npcs, so you end up hearing the same voice over and over again

- Level scaling could have been handled better

- Faces can be hard to look at lol

- Crime system feels arbitrary

- Enemies tend to be bullet spongy (depends on difficulty setting)

- Could have used more dense forest but that's probably due to the engine limitations. 

Overall, an amazing game and experience. I recommend anyone to try this game if they have not yet.

The road becomes muddled. Am I attacked by bandits protecting their claim over an Ayleid ruin? Will I find a powerful bow or enchanted piece of armor which changes my play style? In my travels west, do I meet an insane little man called Glarthir who says he'll pay me 1000 gold pieces to murder his neighbours? Do I ever learn the secret of Agronak's birth?

it's the same hundred hour fetch quest slog with zero decision making on your part that is very fun until you finish one quest line, then you realize nothing you do mattered, and everything was designed to consume your time mindlessly
example:
The main quest (gameplay spoilers for the middle), you are tasked to return fetch item #1 the most important fetch in all of Tamriel. The big bad man has the fetch item, and you must infiltrate his compound. Oh boy this sounds exciting I can't wait for all the ways I can fool these guys into getting the item! Wait what? Why is there only one entrance? Weird. Wait, I can't sneak past this guy? He auto detects me? Oh so there is one linear infiltration path that automatically happens. Oh. Ok I'm at the fetch item, let me kill this guy before he teleports away, so I may get the item. Oh, he's invincible.

It's like the writers realized how short and linear the main story is, realized they needed to make it longer so they removed the option to not fail this quest despite it clearly being designed for you to actually kill the guy. Now they did this so they can interject like 4 insanely massive dungeons filled with copy and paste enemies that are also highly linear and plot-wise empty to pad the game.

Another example:
In the Dark Brotherhood quest line (major spoilers) Lucien tasks you with killing literally every single dark brotherhood member in your sanctum. This is because there's a spy amongus. Naturally you assume you can find the spy, so you open several masterlock chests looking for any clues to find, and theres literally none. No that random barrel that has a masterlock on it in Lucien's room is literally filled with apples. So there is no traitor, atleast any you can find and this guy is telling you to literally kill everyone. So I deduct by that, he's lying, and that he is the traitor. Naw he's essential, can't kill him. Literally zero decisions made on the mission where you betray everyone.
idk especially sucks when you realize theres zero motivation for your character to be doing these massacres other than money, but the story still tries to pretend youre loyal to the DB",1699068455,1699068875,False,1,0,0.472766399383544922,0,True,False,False

i helped a guy kill himself. therefore he didn't kill himself. and it wasn't really me who killed him. it was gravity. so yeah, i wasn't wanted by guards either

i don't know how unhinged developers of that questline were to only have reward for killing him and no option to help him with his situation or anything, but the fact it's this way was hillarious to me. and a bit sad, reading his suicide note i felt like it was more than just a cruel quest. it felt a lot more serious to me at that moment

i am not the ""explore"" and ""story"" and ""atmosphere"" type of ""gamer"", but this game just forced me to, and i liked it, even though the game is harsh. doesn't give much hints on gameplay. the only thing that holds you by the hand and ""babysits"" you is the main quest, which becomes hard if you don't decide to learn about leveling mechanics. the game is fairly simple but also complex due to its open worldness and the age it was released in. . .

Easily Oblivion's greatest strength are the side-quests, which are very creative and intriguing. Notable examples include quests that have you save a painter stuck inside his own creation, or the quest that has you attend a party with the intention of killing everyone inside. Another strength Oblivion has is how alive the world feels, despite how weak the world-building is and NPC conversations are. The soundtrack is also phenomenal and accompanies the 'medieval' feel of the world very well, which makes it a far more immersive experience. However, where Oblivion's biggest issues are lie in the unbalanced level-scaling, the repetitive dungeons and landscapes, floaty movement and combat that while responsive unlike Morrowind, isn't very fluid.

Combat is a little clunky, there's a cookie-cutter approach to some of the dungeons, and clearing out the Oblivion gates gets tiresome, but this game is definitely one to play if you're into RPGs and haven't experienced it yet.

Dungeons are very samey and bland and maddening to get lost in since there was nothing of interest to look at most of the time. NPCs running into your attacks is incredibly annoying. Enemy scaling is absurd. Frequently crashes even with curated modpacks optimized for stability, but I beat most of the game in spite of that and found it to be very enjoyable.

The Knights of the Nine DLC was really cool and has some of the best armor in the game both in aesthetics and power. Unfortunately it only comes in the form of heavy armor.

Similar to to other Bethesda games and RPGs, with a nice balance of serious gameplay and goofy fun. The base game runs smoothly even on older PCs and laptops, although you will run into an occasional gameplay bug no matter your specs. On PC most bugs are easily fixed with console commands or anti-crash mods. Modding is always enjoyable, creating your own custom worldspaces and NPCs is easier than the newer titles; many custom quests, NPCs, armors and weapons are available on modding sites if you want to make the game unique to you.  However the quirkiness of the game is what gives it it's charm; ugly potato-folk, silly AI encounters, and unique quests make Oblivion shine. Obviously the graphics or AI won't be on par with newer games, but for it's time, it was revolutionary in both picture and in NPC intelligence. It also has the largest map out of the 3 main games: Oblivion, then Skyrim, then Morrowind.
And a bit of advice: If you are looking to get started playing The Elder Scrolls but you're conflicted with what game you should start with- it doesn't matter. Each game is so unique and different from each other, but each one has books of lore you can delve into.

I hope that The Elder Scrolls 6 will neither figuratively nor literally become an expansion for Skyrim, and that it will be released pretty soon. 

The time that has passed since the release of Skyrim is already twice the length of time between the releases of Oblivion and Skyrim!

The worlds in Fallout and its lackluster, Spore-themed spinoff no longer interest me.

Bethesda should have developed Starfield only after releasing The Elder Scrolls 6. Even if The Elder Scrolls 6 ends up being a rehash of Fallout 4 set in Tamriel, it would still be entertaining, and worth the wait.

However, it's frustrating that Bethesda Game Studios and Bethesda Softworks have long realized they can still make a fortune by creating 'blank slate' games, rather than delivering more intricate experiences like Daggerfall or even Morrowind. They also rely way too much on their fanbase to fix issues with their games, especially when they create them.

On a side note, I have the feeling they are now going to make games that require DLC to feel complete.

If TES6's release goes past the year 2030, then it took a really long time to develop.

If the base game turns out to be a HD version of Skyrim but has an even smaller scope than Starfield—including another uninspired storyline—it will be kinda disappointing, at least for someone like me.

Bethesda should REALLY... Like seriously... Upgrade their infamous Creation Engine...

It is way past the point where there should be no excuse!

Even if Bethesda does not do a good job, there will be some modders that adapt to Bethesda, but it's lame that Bethesda chooses to adapt to modders by never doing more than ""enough.""",1652910867,1696556918,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Speaking as someone who played Skyrim before taking a stab at TES IV: Oblivion, I cannot recommend this game enough. It's an experience everyone should have at least once. Where else will you hear the voice of Lord Stark talking about his ""friend Joffre""? Nowhere. And did you particularly enjoy the Sheogorath quest in Skyrim (Mind of Madness)? Then this is your game, my friend. Just be sure to get the package with all the expansions, they are more than worth it.

Yes, gameplay/combat can be a little clunky at first, and there is definitely a confusing leveling system, but darn if it isn't magical (literally, invest in your magic skills). You WILL be able to leap tall buildings in a single bound.

The writing is incredible. You get invested in the NPC's lives and totally immersed in the world, just ask Sir Patrick Stewart (who IS in this game, and had some interesting things to say about the experience). I would even say, given the extent of the lore involved, it feels more immersive than Skyrim. Overall, it's a happy medium between the playability of Skyrim and the world building of Morrowind.

Questlines in this game are TOP. TIER. Oblivion Dark Brotherhood > Skyrim Dark Brotherhood, any day. Seriously ominous and actually bad-A. The Thieves Guild questline is epic, too. Expect the unexpected with this game, and remember, you do face in-world consequences for your actions.

Did you feel like a bad person for doing certain daedric quests in Skyrim? No? WELL YOU WILL IN CYRODIIL. Decisions you have to make will always feel high stakes, and sometimes there is no happy ending for a quest. Of course, sometimes being a terrible person is worth the rewards. To the Deadlands with St. Alessia!

And did I mention how acutely disturbing some of the stories are? And it's not down to graphics (believe me); it's really the storytelling and presentation. You're walking through a place called Paradise thinking ""Isn't this pretty, except for the voice of the raving extremist"" and then the next thing BY THE NINE WHAT IS HAPPENING. And don't get me started on what happens when go to meet [redacted] at [redacted].

As for the environment, it's actually quite stunning; it's like playing in a watercolor painting. Just watch out for painted trolls. The dungeons are diverse and difficult to navigate, but in a way that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Dealing with run-of-the-mill encounters can actually be quite challenging, which I often find rewarding. Other times I just start running in the other direction (which DOES work).

And of course, the bugs. Is it a feature or a bug? Yes. The answer is yes.

While I would keep Unofficial Elder Scrolls Page handy until you get the hang of things, any difficulty or frustration with this game is well balanced with fabulous exploits and an endless supply of surprising quests, and some things you just have to see to believe.

The problem, is that the engine for Oblivion is absolute trash, to put it mildly. Even if you are wanting a pure ""vanilla"" experience with no mods, you are not going to have a good time. You need many mods, 3rd party tools, and unofficial patches just to get a [b]SEMI[/b] stable experience. No matter what you do though, you will be besieged by crashes that increase over time.

The pros tell you not to use autosaves or quicksaves. They'll tell you to never overwrite a previous save. They'll say to restart the game after every death. They'll tell you a hundred other tips and tricks that ultimately decrease the enjoyment of your gaming experience.

I cannot count how many times I had to re-do a quest because I kept forgetting to ""save manually"", and then had a crash right before I thought about saving, or times where I died and just decided not to re-open the game. It's exhausting just how much you have to go through just to play the game.

And even if you follow every instruction and every best practice, you will still, inevitably, lose your savefile to corruption. I've tried on multiple occasions to get a solid ""stable"" experience going. I've dumped hundreds of hours into Morrowind, Skyrim, and even Oblivion back in the old days. I had hoped that with all my newfound knowledge and experience of these engines, combined with over a decade of community support, that it would be easy to ""not screw it up"" and get another hundred hours out of from Oblivion.

Attempt #1: Complete and total Savefile corruption after 35 hours.
Attempt #2: Complete and total Savefile corruption after 50 hours.

At the moment of this review, I have 85 hours in Oblivion. I have easily spent more than that trying to research and stabilize a mod list that would maximize the performance, stability, and gameplay aspects of Oblivion. I am feeling very burnt out and disappointed with the end result. I may try and go back to an older save to recover it, but I've done this several times already and I don't have high hopes.",1615934883,1696142891,False,1,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

22330,146435646,76561198039514221,0,4,1478,0,1478,1692288588,"As someone who experienced Oblivion for the first time in 2023 I feel the need to make a review here specifically to address any concerns of people who haven't played the game before. This game was released in 2006 and it can show its age at times which may have newer players hesitant to buy it. My goal is to fairly judge the game by the standards of 2023. Now for the record I came to the Elder Scrolls series relatively late in 2011 with the release of Skyrim and while I have played Oblivion before it was often in short bursts before being distracted by other things. I never got past the second Oblivion gate in the past and since it had been nearly a decade since my last attempt at playing it I went in with little foreknowledge of the game's mechanics or story. At the time of this review I'm 24.6 hours in, have completed several major questlines (thieves guild/ dark brotherhood) and are progressing steadily down the main story as a vampire sneak archer with some magic and a second playthrough underway as a magic user.

     Let's start with the biggest concern of a game from 2006 running on modern PCs: Compatibility. I'm playing this game on an above average gaming rig running windows 10 with an AMD card and so far I have had only a few minor issues that were solved by simply running the game in compatibility mode. These issues were a loading screen visual glitch that was harmless and a brief visual glitch where a ground texture failed to load properly giving a strange color pattern to a piece of the ground at one point. Most modern games launch with far more bugs than what I experienced running this game from 2006 on a modern PC which is saying something. Though many players recommend downloading a mod to improve the game's functioning I found that this isn't necessary and the game works perfectly fine without it.

     Now for the most important topic in my own opinion for a game: Gameplay. The greatest story in the world can't be enjoyed if the game's mechanics are boring. In this case the game holds up surprisingly well but this is the area where its age shows the most. If you're coming to this game from Skyrim or other modern titles you'll have a bit of a learning curve regarding the magic system and the leveling system can be difficult for even veteran Elder Scrolls players to wrap their heads around. While melee weapons and bows use the same first/third person shooter style that the more modern Skyrim/Fallout games use the magic is tied to the ""c"" key by default meaning what ever spell you have equipped can be triggered with this button. You don't equip them in your hands like in skyrim and it takes some practice to learn how to aim. That being said this system, while different, is perfectly functional and even has a few perks over Skyrim's magic such as holding melee weapons.
     The level up system: Oh boy, this is the system that can break the game for new players. I STRONGLY recommend looking up a guide to it before you start playing as it is easy to mess up your stats and you won't realize it until a good ways into the game and find yourself needing to drop the difficulty slider to compensate. Basically your character has base stats like in more traditional RPGs/DnD that affect your core abilities such as strength, endurance, etc. Carry weight, health, sneak, etc are all strongly affected by these. The stats are in turn increased by leveling the side skills that are tied to the particular stat (IE: raising sneak allows you to put points into agility, etc.). Most of this is easy enough to grasp but unfortunately because your health is tied to a particularly cumbersome trio of skills (block, armorer, and heavy armor) it is easy to find yourself seriously squishy if you don't go out of your way to build it up, IE: grinding block skill and heavy armor even though you're a mage. Failing to understand this and keep your endurance stat relevant can, and will, get you killed later in the game. This is my only real negative towards the game as it feels like a game design oversight that forces non melee players to level these skills. That being said, this is a Bethesda game so you know that this issue was fixed in a mod. Though I continue to play without this mod, no one will blame you for going for the easier level up system.

     Story: The bread and butter of an RPG is its story and Oblivion does NOT disappoint. Out of all of the Elder Scrolls titles Oblivion has my favorite storylines. As is typical in an Elder Scrolls game the main story is only a small part of the world's overall story and there is a great deal of side content that will keep you happy. As I said in the beginning I favored a sneak archer and went through the Dark Brotherhood and Thieves guild storylines, both of which were amazing. The robinhood style story of the thieves guild and their feud with a local lawman was both interesting and clever with the missions taking on a cat and mouse style feel. The dark brotherhood line is easily the best in the series with a long and convoluted story I can't really talk about without spoiling major plot points. Do it.
     As for the main story: I found Oblivion to be much more satisfying in its story than Skyrim although not quite as much so as Morrowwind. The gist of it is that portals to Oblivion (the game's equivalent of hell) are popping up and unleashing terrible creatures upon the world and you need to go in and shut them down. All the while the kingdom is trying to solve the issue of a king's succession rights and figure out why this is all happening. As is typical in an Elder Scrolls title you are a nameless, faceless stranger who wakes up on the wrong side of the law to find yourself thrust into destiny. Something I definitely liked about Oblivion's story versus others in the series is that while you are obviously the token ""chosen one"" of the story you aren't the only person actually doing things. Without going into detail there are a few moments in the story where the rest of the world actually takes part in saving itself. Unlike in Skyrim and Morrowwind where the people basically just sort of throw all of the responsibility on the player. It feels like you're HELPING these people overcome their problems rather than just single handedly saving the world while they hide in terror.

     Would I recommend this game to someone who has never played it before in 2023? Yes. I strongly recommend getting this game if you haven't already done so. That being said it, is frequently on sale and you should probably not pay full price (I paid 8$ for the GoTY version and regret nothing). I also strongly urge you to get the GoTY or another version that comes with the DLC. The DLC in Oblivion is legendary as being a prime example of how DLC should be done and it over doubles the amount of content and even makes the game's world bigger than that of Skyrim. The shivering isles DLC is in my opinion worth the price of a full game alone. 
     Graphics: People really judge games by the graphics? I don't generally hold graphics against a game unless they fail on a level that is insulting to the consumer (IE: a AAA title that looks like it was made 5 years earlier). When Oblivion first launched the game was visually stunning and had one of, if not THE, most beautiful worlds in any video game to date. That being said it was released in 2006 and so the visuals are somewhat dated. if you've played Fallout 3 or NV you have a pretty good idea of what you're going to be looking at. I did not find the graphics to be detrimental to my experience at all.
     Summary: The game holds up amazingly well with only a few minor setbacks mostly tied to its leveling system which can be addressed with a quick google search. The story is great, the gameplay excellent, and there really is no real reason not to say that this game is amazing even by 2023 standards.",1694908469,1694908469,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

The sheer size and scope of the open world is incredible - the forests, valleys, cities and dungeons feel richly detailed and full of surprises. Whether you follow the epic main questline or get lost in hundreds of side quests, Oblivion offers an endless adventure.

Creating and developing your character is extremely addicting. The character creator is robust for the time, letting you pick from a variety of races and customize your appearance and skills. Leveling up and picking new abilities feels very rewarding. There's real freedom to play how you want - as a powerful sorcerer, stealthy archer, hulking warrior or any hybrid of those.

Questing in Oblivion is brilliantly done. Even minor side quests are unique and take you to handcrafted caves, castles and ruins. The writing and voice acting brings the world to life. Some questlines like the Dark Brotherhood assassination guild are unforgettable. Just walking the world you'll discover new dungeons and encounters.

While the graphics are understandably dated by today's standards, the art direction of Cyrodiil and its architecture still shines. The orchestral score adds to the grandeur. Combat and gameplay can feel clunky at times, but there's so much to see and do that it's easy to look past.

Oblivion set a new bar for open world fantasy and still holds up as one of the greatest RPGs ever thanks to the incredible attention to detail and worldbuilding. Over a decade later, it remains a must-play for any RPG fan.",1694905006,1694905006,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you like to explore the world, do all the side quests, join every faction and develop your character to become more and more powerful, then Oblivion is not the game for you.
My advice is, If you wish to enjoy this title do not exceed your gametime past 100 hours, try to keep your exploring intact, do the main story along with a several side activities and try to finish the game without visiting every place you come across while traveling the map.
I wish I knew that earlier, but there is a point in this game where leveling your character has no more sense, attributes are maxed out, your equipment is top tier and there is no space for further improvements. Leveling up after a certain point just makes your enemies have more health and hit you harder without giving you anything in return, so you suddenly find yourself in a position where you even avoid sleeping in beds to not level any further.
Leveling system and level scaling in this game is the worst thing I experienced in any RPG game (and I played a lot of these). This is literally the first game I abandoned. I feel terrible, because I was always pushing myself to beat every title I've played, but this time I've failed.

I HATE when an RPG game hits the point when you stop feeling yourself becoming more powerful, when there is nothing more to surprise you, no more items, no more foes. Oblivion gives you such a big world, but fails to deliver a character development system and diversity to keep you going.

And the last aspect which was a nail to the coffin is a fighting system. I could carry on through the game If the combat was satisfying enough. In AC Odyssey, Sekiro or Cyberpunk I also made myself powerful to the limits and there were no more rewards and no more foes for me, but a good combat system gives pleasure and brings enough satisfaction to play the game just for the sake of utilizing it.
This is not the case in Oblivion. There is no weapon feeling, hitting someone doesn't carry any weight to it and there is no freedom of approach.

I feel honestly sad leaving such an iconic game behind. I fell in love with Morrowind. This time tho, mistakes were made. This was my second Bethesda game. I do hope they didn't f*ck up any other titles in a similar way.

That being said, here's a snippet of gameplay on the Steam Deck: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRCT6G-Lkx0

years after the release of this game, it certainly deserves the attention of new reviews.
TES4: Oblivion remains one of the best games I've ever played and certainly the best RPG. The environment is, for a pin from that time, very nice, there is an incredible amount to do and adapt.
The variety in enemies, quests, items, spells etc is incredible and there is always room for discovery and entertainment.
An epic story, a lot of freedom, choices in gameplay, skills to expand, boards full of sidequests, and many hours of gameplay, which also remains fun. Oblivion is still a great game to play for non-RPG gamers as well. Areas, especially the dungeons and the ""Gates of Oblivion"" usually look very similar, but that is also the only real flaw.

Oblivion is already quite old and in the meantime we are waiting for TES6, but in terms of appearance there is a lot of good to say about Oblivion.
The surroundings are generally beautiful; ranging from snowy landscapes to fertile forest and farmland, all of which looked great on my old tube TV.
Players will stop often enough to enjoy the view, just like with Skyrim.
This is something I haven't had in any game I've ever played, well Skyrim and The Witcher 3 or some GTA games also made me stare at the environments a lot, but with Oblivion it was really the first time.
There is a lot to see in terms of ruins, flowers, mountains, rivers and playing deer and the DLCs also bring some extra variations with new fauna and flora. The design and animation of these elements are still quite good and provide a complete picture.

Anyway, it's not always roses and moonshine, The gates of Oblivion have opened. Cyrodiil is flooded with demons from the infernal underworld of Oblivion, where Mehrunes Dagon is lord and master. By chance, or perhaps by fate, you have become the person who has to help solve this. This is the setting of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.

After all, nostalgia is a great drug. And some of the games that got you excited over the years may be downright bad now, but luckily Oblivion isn't one of those games.
Even though the trees don't look so refined today, and the NPCs were a little behind mentally, it's still worth thinking about this game every now and then and starting it up again.",1692746323,1694450175,True,33,1,0.751066863536834717,6,True,False,False

Since the time of Morrowind there have been major enhancements in humanoid ergonomics and physical appearance. Limbs have evolved to swing weapons at lightning fast speeds, spells can be cast with one hand, and faces can give you every expression you would expect from an oddly shaped potato.

Jokes aside, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is a fantastic RPG, but it simplifies some of the concepts of Morrowind to its detriment. Oblivion has a far more graphically and physically populated world than its predecessor, but the locations and dungeons are generally less interesting. Equipable items have been decreased significantly, cutting down on the wackiness of character builds. Levitation was removed from the game, probably because Imperials don't know how to magic. And Oblivion gates... they start out as this fun trudge through an apocalyptic hell-scape, only to become repetitive and boring after a few visits. Oh and Horse armor.

Oblivion does have several wins going for it. The story is fun, engaging, and fairly well written with Patrick Stewart and Sean Bean lending their voices to some main characters. Combat is a 100% improvement over Morrowind with one flaw, there really is no reason to use a 2 handed weapon. Voice acting is a welcome addition, though characters can't provide nearly as much detail in the information presented. The almighty compass makes its debut. The faction quests, while not as long as Morrowind's are memorable and a true joy to complete. 

It is worth dedicating a paragraph to the phenomenal DLC for Oblivion, The Shivering Isles, and the highly underrated Knights of the Nine expansions. 

Shivering Isles brings back much of the foreign terrain that made Morrowind so special, areas are familiar to the player, in that they are perverted and warped versions of structures and nature that we are used to. Sheogorath makes for a strangely compelling character to work with and for, and the entourage and cast of characters are quirky and likeable in their own peculiar ways. The shear insanity of the Isle's will keep you entertained for hours on end. 

Knights of the Nine is not necessarily a fully fledged ""addition"" to Oblivion in the sense of the word. Knights adds some new locations and a swathe of new characters that have an underrated charm to them. Searching the landscape for a Paladin/Crusader armor set isn't something that initially sounds enjoyable, but Knights keeps you on your toes, and makes the experience exciting. Sadly, some of the knights you recruit along the way are named NPC's that can and will die during the final showdown if you are not careful. It is a strangely emotional experience to hear the surviving Knights of the Nine talk about their fallen comrades. 

In summary, Oblivion is the intermittent Bethesda RPG, its light, flaky, and fun while still hitting the hardcore RPG high notes. Oblivion is a staple for western RPG's for many reasons and stands out as one of the finest games of the XBOX 360/PS3 era.

Overall, there is more interesting quests and world here, and if you are going to play an Elder Scrolls game, found that Skyrim actually does suck and is over rated, that Morrowind wasnt for you, then this is the game left.

I believe this is the best of Elder Scrolls. Does that compare to say the best of Fallout? No. one only one Fallout game is good and that is New Vegas. Two, this is not the 9/10 game that New Vegas is.

Its a 8.

I find myself getting bored in this bloated world, that is way similar to Fallout 3, 4, and Skyrim. Worlds that are quantity over qaulity. 6 out of 10s repeatitive trash with little work put into them that over time continued to strip away the rpg elements of their games.

Oblivion I think does half of what New Vegas does that made it good. It has good quests, it has good and interesting areas, and interesting stuff. This still only goes so far though, and its dated gameplay, terrible issues it suffers from similar to skyrim, F3, F4 is just the toe nail clippings on top of this sort of well made cake. it does things I find bareable. If I havent elaborated enough in this review you will get the idea when you see my review of Skyrim and Fallouts. Its above the bar that is a Bethesda game, sitting comfortably at slightly bearable.

Ok, well, that's sort of a lie. Because this game is genuinely amazing, and all of the jank, glitches, and awkward interactions somehow add to the experience, instead of detracting from it.

The combat is fun, the music is phenominal, the story is amazing, and the characters are actually memorable.

Genuinely think that this is better than Skyrim by a fairly large margin. Skyrim has more replayability, a bigger modding community, and a much bigger fanbase, but damn it, Oblivion is just awesome, man. Every questline in Oblivion I believe is superior to their counterpart in Skyrim.

The Ultimate Heist V.S Returning a rusty key (Theives Guild) 
Infiltrating an opposing faction, taking a drug, then realizing that you killed multiple innocent lives V.S Some pack of Furries (Fighter's Guild V.S Companions)
A finished story V.S An unfinished story (Mage factions)
Actual Dark Brotherhood V.S An impersonation group
Being the hero's best friend V.S Being a chosen one (Main Quest)

Oblivion is just much more interesting and creative with what it has. I do not hate Skyrim in the least, it's still one of my favourites, but Oblivion is just something else, man. The world is so much more vibrant and beautiful than Skyrim could ever dream of being.

not interesting and repetitive. The voice acting is top notch and the graphics,
even though very dated, stand up to the test of time (as of 2023 IMHO). The
world is very large, but also very empty; you can walk for 5 minutes and
literally see nothing interesting beyond a wolf or maybe a bear. There is no
real direction outside the main quest and I can see how people get pulled into
the 'open world' aspect for tens if not hundreds of hours, but that isn't me.
Lastly, and my biggest complaint, is that the combat is horrible.

I can't overstate how bad the combat is. I am playing as a mage and I can dump my entire mana bar and not kill one enemy sometimes. Maybe I am not using the right spell, but I wouldn't know because there is little to no information on anything in the game. Is 10 damage a lot? 50?

Again, if you are looking for a world to live in, this game is it. Probably has depth for days, but I want to relax for an hour here and there and this is not the game for that.

so if this game in its complete form is now STEAM: OBLIVION GAME OF THE YEAR EDITION DELUXE (ALL DLC FOR MOD REQUIREMENTS)

So usually goty edition means, the games been out for awhile was pretty well received by everyone and after the dlc has made its rounds and all that shit they spit out a colab for new players to purchase everything in an instant we all waited for and the others who buy content as it comes out bla bla bla yada yada, anger, hatred, annoyance dusihd89732rh9fdf

So if you plan to mod oblivion and you got raped (fucked in the ass) by steam and you have the goty edition, just pirate it, you've earned the right.
if you didn't purchase the goty edition because you were born in 2002 and watched some net famous charasmatic noob who cant play games for shit and want to try playing this game and modding it then get the goty deluxe edition, also can modders stop being dogs and releasing 1.3mb mods that change how an npc farts and start accepting that you need to work with other modders and combining all your content into a single and yes ill accept costs for the installer, like, I install game, i click executable mod collection and it just fucking installs the shit and i can play the game, da fuck are these cunts doing releasing 2 trillion mods and then expect people to use some piece of shit website like nexus that wants to rape me just so i can use some collection thats another rape fest of click rape everthing about the modding community is rape and so is steam, your all money raping pieces of shit

I accidentally became a vampire at one point, the condition progressed and got worse over time as I refused to drink blood, to the point where I could only spend about a minute outside before dying and the challenge of dealing with this with travelling was gruelling and rewarding. I travelled at night hoping to find a tomb or inn to sleep at during the day as I crossed the country and I faced stigma from townspeople who could tell that something was wrong with me.

In my opinion all RPGs benefit from having those, however in Skyrim they did a good job otherwise with character specializations and perks. But it doesn't strike my fancy like Oblivion does. Dragons? Frozen tundra? BOOOOORINGG! Daedra are something I can feel excited about conquering. Not to mention how Skyrim forces you to walk to all cities in the game world before you can fast travel to them. I prefer Oblivion's mantra of all cities you can fast travel the moment you walk out of the Imperial prison

However, Oblivion doesn't have the bow of Shadows like Skyrim does. And a bounty gets placed on your head if you move an item in the object world. (I modded the second one out of Oblivion...). So aside from Dunbarrow Cove Skyrim is better for my usual playstyle, which is a stealth-based archer who steals and collects loot.

Due to the mods, i do have some instability, about every 40 minutes or so when i go through a loading screen, my game crashes. while obviously annoying, it hasnt been too big of deal because ive been saving before i go through loading screens now (100% because of the crashing, not a gameplay thing) Modding it was my own choice and stability is something your always risking with modding, so i cant fault the game itself.
Story Wise so far its been amazing. Im about half way through, done tons of side quests, finished some factions, started the other faction quests, explored probably 60ish% of the map in depth, and my impression so far is that its much more in depth than say fallout 4 or skyrim. 
Quest wise, the Faction storylines feel significantly longer, with better writing. they made me actually feel like i earn my way through the guilds, compared to skyrim where you dont really get ranks or anything, just eventually your always the leader. 
You actually pick a class like a traditional RPG. you can build your character in ways that you really regret in late game, or make the game a breeze based on character creation.
i really enjoy having magic as a separate slot than using one of my hands like skyrim. it makes battlemage builds way more fun, and its just another tool that you can access any time. i feel skyrim took this away because of dragon shouts, but i really hope it comes back for ES6.
Even though im really loving the game and would recommend it to anybody, id be lying if if it said it was perfect. 
Its an old game, while the world is still beautiful, especially with mods, and the gameplay is great and great story telling, holy cow do they have some ugly looking NPCS. like, all of them are absolutely terrible.

Oblivion by default gets more difficult when you level up, enemies become more spongy and if you do not micromanage or mod the attribute bonuses you will quickly become outclassed. If youre coming from Skyrim or even any of the 3d fallout games, switching to oblivion can absolutely be jarring, however if youre able to stick around for one reason or another oblivion really is an amazing game worth putting some time into. 

(Personally while I still do prefer the general gameplay of skyrim, there are absolutely aspects of oblivion that are far better than skyrims counterparts, the biggest being that many of the storylines within oblivion are deeper and more well thought out.)",1546732771,1693450277,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A philosophical piece that traverses through the rather deranged mind of a Redguard. A tome of utmost significance that depicts this Redguards tales of woe under the captivity of the SAESNEG ELDERS. Undoubtedly, the torment he endured in a Redguard household was unparalleled and as a result he fell into a bout of perpetual insanity, concocting dance routines that only the unhinged and naively aloof would willingly enact. 

Diary Excerpts of Goblin Amir – Inexplicably the dates of this Redguards scrawling’s are blurred with a peculiar black smudge, perhaps charcoal or an Redguards tainted darkspawn blood, leaving the timeline ambiguous and faded beyond all recognition. 

“I used to perform the little lads dance back in my youth you know. Berries and cream. Berries and cream. I fondly remember the dish best served upon a marble platter.”

“Berries and cream. Berries and cream. I was innocent once you know, a free range sunflower, whose fire had yet to be stoked and then I was trod upon by two Imperial children who were running amok in their corpulent fathers vineyards. It was then that I was reincarnated as a child in a depraved, conventional Redguard household. Berries and cream, oh how I yearn for berries and cream. Since entering into this world as a vessel anew, I have been tormented incessantly, ruthlessly coerced into participating in Redguard rituals to polymorph into caricatures of Eldritch Daemonspawn. Gradually, my boyish charms and golden locks faded, replaced with what would be gnarled limbs, furtive eyes, and a traditional cokney smile, alongside other more disdainful Redguardian features. Initially I was vehemently opposed to performing that berry dance for my captives amusement, albeit I soon changed my mind after being beaten with a hot poker and coerced into performing sexual acts with my female siblings, under the scrutiny of a camera lens, in exchange for the promise of newfound literature to sate my thirst for knowledge. Inevitably as a result of my endless oppression I relented, capitulating to the whims of my non pious, hedonistic Redguard parents. Gradually feelings of Stockholm syndrome began to set in, distorting my perception of the world and placing the acts of debauchery I committed in a more auspicious light. It was thus that my transformation was complete, I had finally polymorphed into a full blooded Redguard. I would now willingly dance as a puppet on a string for my sustenance, just as my enslaved forebearers had done. Go on onlookers, GO ON crimson cloaked fowls, whip me, make me dance, make me serenade the ballad of my ancestors! BERRIES AND CREAM. BERRIES AND CREAM, I DEMAND MY VITTLES.”

“I tried to kill them you know, I ATTEMPTED TIME AND TIME AGAIN TO SKEWER THEM WITH A PRONGED FORK, ATTEMPTING TO FIGHT BACK AND RECLAIM MY SENTIENCE, IT WASN’T MY FAULT. I DIDN’T ASK FOR THIS! On many occasions did I attempt to utilize cyanide as an alternative for pancake mix. On every second day I attempted to spoon feed my relatives crystalized arsenic, assuring them that what they were gorging their piggy little mouths upon was in fact sugar cubes. I even attempted to brain my sister with a mallet on one misty morn. But nay, despite my valiant efforts they remained alive, robust and formidable in an otherwise demented vessel. They were the embodiment of Achilles, an immortal behemoth ready to cut a swath of temptation and decadence along the cracks of our society, carving their ominous incantations along the walls and hurling excrement at any who appear relatively hinged and exuding a carefree air, insinuating that they were free from the Redguard menace. I WILL SOAR THROUGH THE SKIES AS POLLEN, I WILL RESIST ONCE MORE AND ELUDE THE MADNESS THAT PRIOR ENVELOPED AND ENGULFED MY INNER BEING. IT IS TIME TO RIDE FORTH, NO MORE WILL THE SAESNEG TORMENT THEIR YOUTH, THEY WILL RUE THIS DAY WHEN FIRE AND BRIMSTONE RAIN DOWN UPON THEM.” 

“I’m at my wits end; I’m going to hasten the speed of reincarnation and polymorph into a sunflower again. That’s why I have this here hole and am currently in the process of planting myself. I shall become a sapling anew, reborn as a noble herb that will genuinely contribute to society, more than any REDGUARD could have. Oh Norns, Duna, Vraccas, SHOR, THE NINE above, grant me my earnest wish, send forth a radiant light from the heavens and transmute my body and soul into that of an altruistic and carefree sunflower. I wish for my petals to become sandstone, an alluring smile and countenance fair and to be deeply nestled into nature’s most serene of soils. Give me the power O’lord, ensure that these tears I have grieved over the years have not been for naught. AH YES, I CAN FEEL IT, THE POWER COURSING THROUGH MY PAIN WRACKED BODY. The lord wishes for me to gorge myself on soil, only then can I enter the state of entrancement necessary to morph my appendages into roots and my cranium into a bedazzling flower. IT IS TIME TO DINE ON THE LAND, THE SOIL IS THE FOUNDATION OF OUR SOCIETY AND AS SUCH WE MUST PAY IT PROPER HEED.

I probably would've finished everything had I run everywhere instead of walking everywhere, getting into my character, feeding them when I think they should be hungry and getting the recommended amount of sleep. 

Being in this world is just a pleasure to me. Admiring the 2006 high fantasy landscapes and cities that don't look a year under 20. And chatting up every ugly mug I see because I know they'll have something entertaining to say. I just can't help but take my time with it and complete everything I can in one city to let my excitement build up for the next one. I love them all but Bravil doesn't really compare to the others. That place is a colorless ****hole but it still has great quests.

The only part of this game that I probably should've felt less compelled to fixate on is dungeons. The caves were my favorite part of this game growing up and I really don't get it. I think it was just some childhood fascination with real caves but they're pretty boring most of the time and when I got the means, I usually just used turbostealth to literally push past every enemy. Not even doing these dungeons would've been the right call and it's especially true for Oblivion gates. I remembered loving them as a kid and on return, I did for a while but there's like, 100 gates in the world and around 6 Oblivion dungeon layouts that any of these 100 gates can lead to, making them all mind numbingly repetitive.

Whatever though, just don't shoot yourself in the foot like me and focus only on doing quests for people. Forget about the caves and I think this becomes one of the funniest and most enjoyable gaming experiences I've ever had, despite the indisputable lack of quality or consideration in just about every one of the game's core elements. Seriously, look up a video of how redonculous the leveling in this game is. It's comical but I don't feel like explaining it

Highly Recommend getting this game. 

The short version : 
This game is worth buying. There is so much to do in a really nice world to explore. Magic or brute force or use both as you explore the world and uncover quests. 
Do you want to save the world? then can do the main quest, do you want to be a wanderer instead? then just wander the land this game does not force you to do what it wants. Instead it says 'hey heres a big land go live in it' .

The not short version : 
You start off as a prisoner not knowing why you are there.
 About a minute into your cell time and the king visits you! 
And everybody is like 'what you doing here this cell is not meant to be used a cell...' 
Shortly after this you got some dungeon delving to do and learn how to swing a sword, fire an arrow, cast a spell, loot dead people and then after this dungeon bit you are set loose on the open world. 

This world is beautiful really rich with lots of countryside and lots of lakes/ponds to explore too. 
Which as you explore will reveal mines and dungeons and forgotten overgrown forts filled with monsters and loot. 
The difficulty can be set to whatever you wish which means if monsters get a little tough you can lower it and build up your skills a bit more and get better spells/equipment and overcome them in your own time or you can do the opposite and put the difficulty up to suit your own experience.

If you would like a little bit of direction but don't want to do the main quest there are guilds which will help you explore with purpose.
Currently I am playing in both the thieves guild and magic guild and being bit of a wanderer.
You will find these guilds very easily the mages guild has guild houses in each city and the thieves guild can be found in the poorer area 'waterfront' of the imperial city. 
There are other guilds and you can discover them yourselves (I don't want to give spoilers).
Advantage of the Thieves Guild is you can sell any stolen items to the guild and they will give you quests too. 
 - If you are sneaking about someones house stealing their stuff I suggest not to wear your big heavy iron armour gear instead wear something like leather armour that helps you be more quiet. 
Advantage of the Mages Guild is you can learn to create spells and enchant weapons and armour and get given quests to do too.
- Don't steal from Mages if your in the Mage guild.


What I really like about this game is the setting and playing it just makes the day feel better going out in the countryside or visiting a quaint village/town. 
You are encouraged to pick plants and these can be used to make potions and the more you do the better you get. Rarely have i ever rolled my eyes at not having enough money to buy something I want. I can go out into the world and find monsters/dungeons to loot and make potions to sell or go on bit of a thieving spree through a town and sell to get money.

The first main purchase I encourage you to get as soon as possible is the shack on the waterfront you need 2000 gold to get the basic shack which includes containers to store your valuables. 
I would make this the first priority of your game. It seems a little steep getting 2000 gold but it will help you learn and grow as a character. 
There are quests that can help you on your way to that 2000 gold too. 
Explore the city shops and you will find the Commerce building to buy the shack. 
There are other houses to buy in different towns you will find these in your own time and all can be decorated and have more containers/cupboards and furniture bought for them. As you acquire more mementos like weapons and armour or books and trinkets this helps organise the hoarded loot you might not want to sell. One goal of mine is to own a copy of every book in the game - and every book can be read in game too!

There are downsides to this game but not many. I would recommend saving often which is not hard to do. 
Sometimes the peoples voices can be a bit samey.
I would like to be able to make friends with some monsters rather than just go and batter them with an axe - but there are spells that can help calm them.
There is a bard class but its not like you can be a bard and sing your way through enemies its about your stats not a roleplaying style.
I would have liked to be able to build an army and conquer all the towns/city and impose my own rule upon the happy folk.
Its not that kind of game though instead you can become head of different Guilds and lord it over your peers. 

There is lots to explore, to do, to steal, to kill, to learn and you can do it all in your own time. It is easy to get sidetracked as you talk to the inhabitants of the game you may find more quests or learn of another mine to seek out and this helps break any feeling of missing out on something when being able to do things in your own time.

To sum up before i ramble on about everything in the game and lose the next several hours to writing...

The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion® Game of the Year Edition is the fourth part of the series, this time taking us to Cyrodiil; the heart of the Empire in times of greatest crisis on the continent.
[h1]The Plot[/h1]
We play here as the Champion of Cyrodiil; a hero chosen by the Emperor himself to, together with other important characters, save the world. It's not a very fresh concept, but the game mixes many interesting quests (which we can approach in different ways), that the plot definitely deviates from the norm in some parts. The characters are interesting, and even though most of them have the same voice actor, they have enough different personalities to be interested in them. The best character is of course Martin, played by Sean Bean (who of course eventually dies, afterall, he is Sean Bean, the master in art of dying). If I were to briefly describe the plot, I would assign it to the category of more fun to experience, but not as fun to think about. Perhaps the best aspect of it is the ending itself, where we fight in the streets of the Imperial City, against demons and the main villain, but every time I play it seems to me that it is also a very wasted part. Apart from the destruction around us, we do nothing but run from door to door, and this happens in the space of maybe one minute. I think Sean Bean's death sequence itself is twice as long. Apart from that, the game also includes the Shivering Isles story DLC which is really solid and it focuses on the madness in people's hearts. Each character acts like a TikTok user after a few minutes of not getting massive doses of dopamine into what's left of their brains. So yes, madness and mania are cranked up to the max.
[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Starting with the character creator, it is good, maybe even too good, but in a bad way. We have so many options, that we can create a Fallout mutant very easily, and since apparently Bethesda employees have never seen a real human in their lives, the characters look like stretched-out mannequins from the start, so creating a good-looking character is an almost impossible task. Moving on to the basics, there's a lot of cool armors and weapons, and a lot of it is given as rewards for completing some really cool side quests. Unlike Skyrim, a shockingly large number of these quests have interesting dialogues, interesting locations (the map itself has a lot of such locations, and although they are sometimes repeated, exploring a very large map is very exciting and interesting), not to mention interesting characters and enemies. There are, of course, typical fetch quests here, but they are not as painful as in the next game of the series. It is also worth mentioning that at the beginning of our adventure, we can create our own character class, so it allows for many possibilities in modifying our skills / attributes at the start. It doesn't matter much in the long run, but it's an interesting concept. Before I end this segment, I need to mention ""difficulty levels"", if I can even call them that. It's basically a bar that, when moved to the right, makes the game harder. Exciting as fuck. We have no idea how difficult or easy the game will become, at the highest ""difficult settings"" the game is not difficult, it's tiring. Enemies of (any kind) become sponges for damage, our armor turns to cardboard so we can die from a stronger gust of wind, and our weapons are so painfully weak, that it's like we're slapping someone with swimming pool noodles. Bethesda simply can't create effective difficulty levels for their games.
[h1]Technical Matters[/h1]
Although the game has its moments, let's face it, graphically it is terrible, especially when we talk about details and character design. At least the game never kicked me to the desktop. Speaking of bugs, there are a lot of them, but they are of the ""very funny, not annoying"" type. At times this game turns into pure comedy, and the very wooden animations are the icing on the cake. But it was the dialogues that made me laugh the most, as I said before, Bethesda had very few voice actors, so to make each character as original as possible, they had to improvise, so the voice actors often put their dialogue in very funny tones of voice, making the characters sound like they were going through a very aggressive voice mutation. This game is similar to the Star Wars Prequels in that aspect, there are so many memes and weird dialogues, that I just can't take it all seriously. I would also like to mention the music, which is great. Each piece is really well done, and it adds a lot of atmosphere to the locations. But at the end, nothing beats the music/theme from the main menu.
[h1]Summary[/h1]
A very good game that was a really great phenomenon in its day, however, it has not aged well, and this title definitely needs a remake. There is a lot of potential here for a really great game that can compete and even beat the current quality of games on the market. I've heard rumors that Bethesda has plans for an Oblivion remake, but it hasn't been confirmed. I'm also looking forward to Skyblivion, a fan project porting the game to the Skyrim engine, complete with existing and original mods, textures, assets, etc. I'm really interested in the future of TES: Oblivion, and I hope Bethesda doesn't ruin this opportunity to resurrect the classic.

This is one of the most awesome games and at the same time one of the most broken games I have ever played.
Broken, not in the sense that it is buggy. In fact it runs almost perfectly, especially this edition with all the release bugs worked out.

What I mean is that while playing the game ""normally"" is loads of fun, the objectively best, most effective way is to play it totally wrong.
This was the first time Bethesda pioneered an adaptive level system, meaning that enemies are always as powerful as you. That means that if you choose all the spells as class skills but make your main attribute strength and endurance, then focus only on swords, you will only face imps and goblins your entire game.
Funny exploits like this are everywhere in Oblivion, but in the end if you want it to be easy just turn the ""difficulty"" slider all the way down. That way it will be easy without you making a fool of your character. :)

One thing I truly love is that you can choose to not start the main story. In fact, Oblivion is almost two games:
Play the main story, and Gates pop up everywhere, demons swarm out, and you get challenging dungeons filled with gore and epic loot.
Don't start the story, and no Gates, no Demons, but instead the landscape is unscarred and you see Cyrodiil in all its perfect beauty. 
You can even complete all the side quests, buy a bunch of houses, become master of all guilds, and only THEN start the main quest. If you do that, it will be very different indeed since the enemies match your level.

This is JUST the story, I'm not even getting into the many ways to play the game itself.
You can be a sword-master without peer, an bow-wielding stealthy assassin, even beat enemies with your fists.
Focus on one element to defeat your foes, or focus on all three. Or use magic in a more subtle way to enhance your abilities, convince people to fight you in crowded areas to avoid getting charged, turn invisible to walk right past a cave full of bandits, even goad enemies into fighting each other so you don't have to!
And best of all, you will probably end up doing ALL OF THE ABOVE since there are no classes. Given enough time, you can be a master of all things.

I can guarentee that you will never forget the dark brotherhood or the thieves guild after you experience them and those are just the cream of the crop, the game is loaded with a lot of pretty original and memorable quests that each tell their own little stories ranging from comedy to drama that a surpising ammount of involve no combat at all, relying more on investigation, dialogue or stealth which makes them all the more fun because they can focus on the story instead of the fighting.

And the characters themselves are also amazing, the entire arena crew is so well writen, likable and dripping with personality, its impossible to not have Owyn grow on you after you grow on him and there isn't a person in the world that will ever forget Lucien Lachance from the brotherhood. 

And who can forget the shivering isles, bethesda's take on alice in wonderland that in of itself is so good it blows the entire base game out of the water and is imo one of the best expansions for any game ever, amazing narrative, characters and enviroments.

TES IV: Oblivion (2006) was the very first game of the Elder Scrolls series I ever played, and it quickly became one of my most favourite video games of all time. My brother had built a brand new custom computer and allowed me to sometimes play games of his collection - this game was one of them.

As a young child, I was first presented with the character creation screen - which was a new concept to me at the time. Whilst it was basic, it was nice to design my very own character and choose a race. The opening story line, with it's characters, voiced dialogue, and combat, was very interesting indeed. It was a rewarding achievement to finally escape the Imperial prison. I was quickly thrown to explore this vast 'alien world', which I knew nothing about. I did not understand the game's mechanics and had no knowledge of actual Elder Scrolls lore, but I was drawn from the start.

As a kid, I found the game very difficult and the combat very challenging, so I actually tried avoiding combat as much as possible. I did not know about the 'wait' feature - which replenishes the player's health. My main fixations at the time was exploring the vast world and completing the various quests throughout the world. It was a lot of fun!

~~~Adult Play~~~
As I got older, my game knowledge rapidly grew. I began to understand the game's features a lot better and starting to understand how challenging the vanilla's levelling system could be. By now, I knew the major vanilla quests ever so well. My favourite quests were the side miscellaneous quests. It was very rare that I would advance far throughout the main quest line.

The longer the videogame had been out, the more available guides, articles, and tutorials, became available on the internet. It was online articles and guides, as well as YouTube tutorials, which helped me fine tune the game to suit my own personal preference and liking. This helped enhance the game play and improve the sustainability and performance of the game it's self.

~~~Essential Mods~~~
The game's frequent crashes and bugs would sometime frustrate me beyond belief. I absolutely loved the game to bits, but hated the issues it was shipped with. Thankfully, I discovered different fan made MODs. Early MODs that I used just involved the Unofficial Patches, but it was later on where I would start to form even more advanced MOD lists with both 'essential MODs' - such as bug fixes - and 'additional MODs' - like better textures and companion NPCs.

~~~Personal MOD List~~~
Today I use Mod Organizer 2 (MO2), but have installed MODs manually. I have also used Wyre Bash in the past, as well as Vortex and Oblivion Mod Manager (OMM). By far, Mod Organizer 2 is my most favourite MOD manager utility, with built-in LOOT (Load Order Optimisation Tool). With TES IV: Oblivion, there are MODs which are essential - needed for everyone, and MODs which are additional extras - such as Kvatch Rebuilt MOD.

I have my very own custom MOD list here with some of the best community MODs ever released - https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3014674020",1410704909,1691758140,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Sadly it has not appealing visuals (not even back in the day had) so people tend to ignore it just because of the graphics and ""ugliness"" despite being an excellent game. Mods such as OCOv2 can fix the NPC's visuals and blessed walking can implement the missing diagonal walking/run in 3rd person. Those two mod and their dependencies don't require wrye bash to be used, which is other reason people avoid Oblivion because most of the good mods under the sun require wrye bash to use and modders ""gatekeep"" people with tiring and long explanations and 3 hours essays of how wrye bash works and their impacts in the economics of yugoslavia or smth instead of saying ""right click on the bashed_patch.esp and click 'build patch' and agree with whatever wrye bash recommends and if does not work, see the tutorials and the essays"". One thing to be considered is this game is WAY more unstable that Skyrim and crashes randomly, so ALWAYS REMEMBER TO SAVE. 

One thing i forgot to say: The dungeon design is AWFUL, some areas are inaccessible without high level acrobatics in badlands and the dungeons in general are too look alike and does not circle (boss room  close to the entrance) like in Skyrim, which every dungeon is recognizable.

It has aged poorly in almost every way possible, and mechanically speaking it's objectively not good at all by 202X standards, but some parts, like the world itself, the writing, the exploration and the stories you can create for yourself have aged like fine wine.
A friend introduced me to the game when I was 8 years old, and I've sunk a LOT more time in it that the Steam hours counter shows.

You will definitely have to mod it at least slightly in order to make it less dated - I suggest something like Realistic/Ultimate Levelling to fix the broken level up system, and something else to combat scaling. The combat is quirky and weird, but you can get used to it and mess motherf#ckers up. The graphics are dated, too, and you will probably want to use OCO, unless you find humor in the absolute abominations that Oblivion facegen is known for. However, the dated graphics give the scenery this watercolor aesthetic, and I've not seen a game replicate the mix of styles quite as well as this game. The music is fantastic, and Jeremy Soule is a genius.

The main reason to play this game is the Cyrodiil. You'll get lost in the forests and dungeons and find thousands of interesting stories. It's not a fetch quest nightmare like Skyrim, being closer to Morrowind in terms of short, interesting stories within quests. The Guilds, the Dark Brotherhood, the Shivering Isles and the Daedric shrines provide fantastic plots that never get old, while the towns and villages provide extensive replay value. You'll always find something new when coming back to this game - something funny, mysterious or interesting; even if you've seen it all, there's not enough space in the brain to remember it all. I'm still SO far from having seen it all, though after 15-ish years. It's knowing there are still things left unseen, the small things, that make it even more interesting to come back to - like finding a dead troll under a bridge with a sad suicide note.

It's definitely not a perfect game. In fact, it's kind of a sh1t game in %current_year%, but to me, it's still the best game of all time. If you're a modern gaming snob, or if you're scared of dated mechanics and can't stand the lack of feedback in combat, you might just hate it, but if you're looking for an endless supply of interesting stories set in an excellent world (while being tolerant to some mild jank), you have to buy this game.",1628243280,1691498635,True,5,1,0.560475170612335205,1,True,False,False

This is literally my favorite game of all-time. Always has been ever since I first stepped foot into Cyrodiil back in 2006 as a mere 8 year old. Had the old PC box set and everything. Had the DLC boxes as well. At the time, I just hijacked my dad's character and murdered everyone I came across haha. But when I made my own character, I began to appreciate and enjoy the world and quests for what they were, even as a kid. This was the first game that I truly fell in love with. 

Ever since then, I have played through it multiple times with different and unique builds. And every time I play, I found something new that makes me appreciate the game even more. It has the usual Bethesda jank and bugs but honestly it servers to actually improve the game experience to me. It has its own charm of being a buggy, jank, meme game and I love it. This is largely due to the laughable AI that is honestly just terrible, but in a good way. I would best describe the AI as a Neil Breen film (if you know, you know). 

While the main quest line is solid, the true highlight of this game are the side quests. Many of them are so memorable that there are some I haven't done in 17 years, and I still remember them. The guilds are very guild too. I find the fighter's guild to be somewhat weak here, but the mage's guild is great! The dark brotherhood and thieves' guild are just in another league though. They are absolutely stellar. I would recommend playing the games just for those two quest lines alone. The arena is a very unique experience as well and very fun! Especially the reward you get for competing it *wink wink*. 

The world and cities are also incredible. The region is very diverse with the snowy mountains that border Skyrim to the north, to the swamps in the south, and the massive forests with lakes/rivers in between. The Imperial City is an amazing area teaming with things to do and places to explore with many interesting NPCs to talk to. Other personal highlights include Skingrad, Bruma, and Bravil. I feel like each city has a myriad of unique side quests that will have you remembering that particular place for a long time. The DLCs is also incredible, both of them. The Shivering Isles is often regarded as one of the best DLCs ever made.

There are many weapons and builds that you can use as well. This game is much more of an RPG than skyrim. You can even make/name your own class here! My personal favorite is the sword/board or a greathammer. I also enjoy being an archer! Magic is very potent in this game as well, so if you enjoy playing a mage then you'll have a good time here.

All in all, this game is an absolute must-play for anyone who enjoys anything resembling an RPG. I have said this for years and I'll say it again, I have never met anyone who has played both Skyrim and Oblivion and preferred Skyrim. I love Skyrim, but this game just hits different.

This game is truly Todd ""Godd"" Howard's best work. Play it!

An ungodly amount of fetch quests, a broken leveling system, cheesy NPC dialogue/main quest, absolutely retarded AI pathfinding, all coupled with the tech limitations of a 2006 release.

And yet, none of these issues have put me off from investing a second 60 hours into a near-completion playthrough. Not one alchemical ingredient, not one dungeon, not one quest item was one too many, and all this without a single mod. No, one cannot simply put this game down once one has become an apprentice of the ancient school of console commands. It is true that, though some frown upon this forbidden practice, it has long tainted many an honest playthrough, whether that be due to poor save management or game-breaking bugs. And this author, indeed, is no stranger to such putrid chicanery. 

But let us not dwell on the foul stench of apathy, for the world of Cyrodiil commands a charm about it so enchanting, you will lose yourself at once in its vast and epic world, wherein every rock, hill, tree, lake, river, cavern, mountain, beachside, creek, and tree stump were put into the game with intent and careful thought. Not one corner of Central Tamriel has been left untouched, and even in 2023 it remains an impressive feat by the developers.

Of course, one of the most impressive and renowned features in these games is the player’s ability to open nearly every door in the entire world. Once you enter a city, make your way to a village, or spot an inconspicuous shed in the middle of the woods, all it takes is a lockpick and a bit of skill, and you’re inside a [b] fully furbished [/b] room, often with a dedicated NPC and an occasional quest item such as a note or valuable loot. This level of freedom is what I have sought in video games ever since playing Vice City for the first time eight years ago.

The other aspect at which these games excel is the lore. The hundreds of books in each game provide a staggering amount of background as to what the hell is even going on. Who is Uriel Septim? Why are the Daedra invading Tamriel? Who built the White-Gold Tower, and what are these ancient ruins scattered all over Cyrodiil? All these questions can be answered within a quick visit to the book store, or even by searching through a random NPC’s living room. And, of course, the in-game fiction praising one race and disparaging another in order to establish the politics of Nirn will never cease to amaze with its unwavering continuity.

Since I have already outlined my biggest gripes with the game in the first paragraph, I’ll just mention the occasional monotony of going into a dungeon, slaying a dozen or so creatures, and lockpicking a chest to retrieve a badass weapon or some other quest-related item. It’s definitely fun the first couple of times, but by dungeon number thirty-five, the mechanic certainly overstays its welcome. I’m not even going to mention Oblivion gates, as I had to enter no more than ten (compared to the 100 that spawn throughout the game) for the entirety of the main quest line. The previous and next games in the series did dungeons a lot better in my opinion.

[i] So come for the action and stay for the lore in this ancient realm of arcane cults and mighty warriors, the resting place of kingdoms of old and the cradle of change, all unified by the Glorious Empire!

I am so glad I switched to PC.

The game runs really well and the textures are gorgeous. As someone used to playing on console, the PC controls feel really smooth, although took me a little time to get used to. There's been no lag at all. And I can also play with mods!

I don't care if it's getting towards 20 years old; it has aged so well.  And I know there's the whole Skyrim vs. Oblivion vs. Morrowind argument out there that will never end, but Oblivion was the one that got me into Elder Scrolls in the first place, so it'll always hold that special place in my heart.

The gameplay is mostly very fun. Combat (unlike Morrowind) is more satisfying and although it isn't anything spectacular like in other first person games, it serves the task well for the scope of this game, being a vast role playing open world game with tons of things to do. However, my biggest complaint with the game is Auto-leveling, and Dungeons. Auto leveling results in the strength of enemies accelerating faster than yours, not slower, meaning that eventually, they become health sponges. Mods somewhat aliviate that, but not fully from my experience. Dungeons are also kind of bland. Not much variation, and much backtracking back to the entrance. Probably as a result from only *one* person working on the dungeons.
Beside those 2 gameplay nuances, the game doesn't have any other significant downsides. The narrative is somewhat decent, and like combat, serves the job well *enough*. But the side quests and the atmosphere are just phenomenal. While the game's looks seem to be generic, the music isn't at all. Many side quests have clever twists and turns, and some offer interesting experiences, such as the quest of stealing an elder scroll.
Character creation and leveling are very complex that there are many different classes that can be creating, enhancing role playing and improving replayability.
All in all, just install some patch mods and a mod or two to fix up auto-leveling, and maybe add some QOL features, and you will have a very fun experience.",1690705805,1690705805,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1. The brush will paint whatever is in it's users imagination, if they are imagining photo-realism it will paint that imagined image.
2. When the 1st user (a descendant of Bravam Lythandas) stepped into the 1st painting he made he never left it, he only inhabits an imaginary version of the real world that fooled even himself perhaps.
3. Other people would (even if just by accident eventually) enter the painting with this 1st artist and could ever time become fooled or believe that they are free but they are not. These people and their decedents are who handed down the brush to it's owner when we find him.

If true this means the entire lore from the point the brush was created and 1st used by the descendants of Bravam is influenced by what that original artist might have thought about the world. How those ideas have grown on their own over the years as the brush users continue painting a painting inside a painting for fake clients thinking they are free is all we have. We know nothing about the ""real"" world of these games.

Ingredients:

1 rat trap

6 oz sharp cheddar cheese

One 12-oz can spinach

One bottle ""cooking"" skooma

1 box crackers, gnawed open

2 quarts water

One tbs olive oil

Pinch of salt

Set the trap, using a sliver of cheese. Bring water to a boil. Catch the rat and toss it into boiling water. Cover, reduce heat and simmer 30 minutes. Stir occasionally. Open spinach can, drain. Pour crackers into stew to thicken. Take salt and throw over your left shoulder. Rub olive oil in your hair. Eat the rest of the cheese, drink the skooma. Eat spinach out of can Popeye-style. Strain rat-water mixture into glass container (observing personal limit of two gallons fresh water daily), and use water to rinse hair and dishes. Pour the rat stew overboard.

I was worried about the graphics going into this Oblivion. But from the very beginning and now 5+ hours in I'm not worried about that anymore. And I was sure to complete a few big quests before this review. 

The graphics are just fine and it doesn't detract from the game at all. Even more - In some places, while it remains obvious that Skyrim's ""graphics"" are far superior, you can actually argue that Obvlion is more visually appealing and more creative in many ways. And I'm saying that just 5 hours in, as I've played hundreds of hours in Skyrim. The architecture, layout, maps, etc of Oblivion are all very interesting. I could argue even a notch above Skyrim.

Regarding game play? It's practically just an earlier version of Skyrim with a different interface, and I actually much more preferred diving into this game. Skyrim is always a little tough at first, whereas with Oblivion I dove right in and didn't feel overwhelmed by anything.

Older graphics..., clunker interface..., sure. But a great game so far.

Each time it plays well so long as I stayed within the general continent of Oblivion, however each time I get into the Shivering Isles I begin to have serious issues when I am about half way through. My first game through played to level 44 and became unplayable. The second quit at level 42 and this last stopped at level 37. The problem begins with a 'cloudy' effect around my character which in time makes it difficult to see. In my first play through it became impossible to see anything except periphery and the cloud effect. In the second game I came to a door which should have opened, but came open only half way. In each game it refused finally to load the last saved game and so ended any opportunity to go further. In my second game, I would save the game, but on trying to load the save later was told repeatedly the file was corrupted. Going back to a previous save which did work would not change the corrupted file behavior later. 


The game itself was fine, but no Skyrim. The player leveling system was limited, but I could deal with that. It seemed the game took a LOT of management which continually took me out of combat, etc. This is a good enough game for something different but I won't have any expectation of actually being able to play it through.  

OK. I have played this again after unchecking any gaming added in (Shivering Isles, etc.) to play only the basic game. I did not pay for any teaching and never fast traveled. At level 44 it began the 'cloudy effect' and after several minutes I was in a cave and the game just went away. I tried three times to load at the last save but it would not. I tried at the previous save and it would not load. The save prior to that did load, but to a significant loss of play time. Experience tells me the game will not play going forward and the game is finished. I did not get to do the Great Battle for Bruma, or any subsequent quests leading to the final battle at the Imperial City. For me, this is a game that is good enough to play for fun but the satisfaction of actually finishing it is not there at all. Too much time invested for what I get out of it.

This game is a blast from the past.  This is arguably the best of the series due to the shear volume of story lines and stuff you can pull off in this game.

Negatives: 
#1 Steam no longer supports the operating systems that this game will work best on.  That means that it is a coin toss whether you will have a very buggy experience or an amazing one.
#2 your mods will need to be activated after you get out of the initial prison you are stuck in, otherwise the game will not launch properly.

While Skyrim is a great game it was geared towards people who loved the series as well as people who had never played it and introduced a lot of features to help users who were not familiar with RPGs. 

Oblivions quests have a greater variety and seem much more plugged into the lore than Skyrim. 

Oblivion features many more skills and trees then the other iterations of elder scrolls games. Even jumping increases exp in a skill tree.

The game centers around the assassination of the king of cyrodil and his hier, a secret child whom has no idea of their heritage,
And the deadric princes of oblivion whom have begun an invasion of cyrodil through newly erected portals to the planes of oblivion that serve as their homes. 

The gameplay is fluid and exciting while also having many areas to explore and adventure,
A great deal of side quests and guilds to complete and join, a vast array of magical relics and items to obtain, a system for magic and many trees of combat skills including unarmed for pugilistic players. 

The final DLC for this game titled ""The Shivering Isles"" explores the realm of sheogorath the deadric prince of madness. It is arguably the best piece of elder scrolls content that exists to date. 

The graphics of this game have not aged well, but can be improved to modern standards through the use of nexus mods, and I highly recommend doing so. There is a great deal of interesting and game improving mods available for this title and they are extremely easy to implement using nexus mods manager or vortex mod manager. 

Overall I would say that oblivion has the best high fantasy feel of the elder scrolls series and is an extremely enjoyable game that has withstood the test of time. It has great replay value and can easily net you hundreds of hours of enjoyment with it's vast collection of nexus mods.

I was kinda young and didn't really get that far. But when Oblivion came out, I was absolutely addicted! I had this game on Xbox 360 originally and must have put in over a thousand hours into it. Then, when I switched to PC; I got it on disc version. Finally, I ended up getting it on Steam too. 

What can be said about this title for those who love Skyrim, but have never played Oblivion? The transition might be hard for you... The graphics are vastly outdated now (Heck, even Skyrim is), the combat system is very simplistic. The NPCs are absolutely ridiculous and can't be taken seriously... 

That being said... Oblivion is vastly superior to Skyrim in every other way. Let's take the mages guild as an example. In Skyrim, you join up with the college with next to no difficulty at all. Your first assignment is to go on a little field trip. On that first assignment, you uncover something that leads you on a small-ish journey. By the end of that journey, you become the Archmage for some reason... That's it. You're done... In Oblivion, you must travel across the entire province of Cyrodiil. You must visit every single chapter of the Mages guild, where you learn new spells, are imparted with wisdom and knowledge of all things magical and collect recommendations from all the chapter heads. Once you have been recommended by every single chapter, you are permitted to join the University. You are now an Apprentice! Your first task is to go collect wood and such to construct your first staff. You also now have access to creating your own spells (Amazing system!). Hooray, all those hours of travelling the province for those recommendations has paid off! But you're just an Apprentice... The journey is just beginning. You slowly carry out tasks for your master and rise the ranks, 1 by 1. You become more powerful and you get closer and closer to the top of that career ladder. Eventually, a big villain is introduced who could have easily been a villain of an entire game. You end up vanquishing him and saving the Mages Guild and rise to the esteemed rank of Archmage after proving yourself over time and time again. 

That is the difference between Skyrim and Oblivion. This same scenario is repeated for every single faction! I can't express how much I resented Skyrim for how crap the guild factions were... 

Anyway, the game is ridiculously cheap so if you can get past the outdated graphics, simplistic game mechanics and goofy NPCs... You'll find a gem in Oblivion!",1689218603,1689218603,True,139,3,0.906852126121520996,0,True,False,False

You'll find yourself in an open world rich with lore, people and locations ready for you to discover in any way you like. You can be certain that you'll find adventure anywhere you go. Even if you're lost walking through the wilderness, you'll probably end up helping a small village affected by a careless mage experiments.

As any gem, it has its flaws. It is of no mystery that Oblivion difficulty is a problem. Unlike Morrowind, the enemies level as you do, but unless you take care of the way you level up, your character will end up weak against most of the enemies you'll find. This can be dealt with, either through native gameplay or mods, but for a newcomer it can become tedious, so be prepared for this.

There is far less ""chosen one"" nonsense, though sadly the game is not entirely free of this common Bethesda trope. The gameplay is also, in some respects, better: I prefer the game's approach to spells for example, because switching between a two handed sword and spells in Skyrim is far more cumbersome.

That being said, it definitely shows its age. The smaller cast of voice actors means that you can witness entire conversations playing out between two or three characters who sound the same. The animations are stiff. The models are severely deficient in detail. Even the Imperial City feels oddly small. And while modding the game can do a little for its looks, it's never going to hide that this game launched in 2006.

And then of course, there's the crashing. Especially with mods this game crashes very frequently, so be prepared to save extremely frequently.

The most egregious thing is that the game lists both a GOTY edition and GOTY ""Deluxe"" edition on Steam to this day. There is no way to upgrade from standard to Deluxe after buying one of them and most mod packs require the Deluxe, so be extremely careful when buying that you don't get the objectively inferior version. I also recommend buying the game on sale as its normal price is still rather high for such an old and in many ways broken game.

I actually really enjoyed Oblivion, especially because when I was a child I gave up pretty quickly so it was nice to actually do most of what the game had to offer. Now, this game has a ton of flaws, no doubt. The leveling system is very complicated, despite being a very interesting take. The scaling is god awful and basically requires you to do the main story as quickly as possible to prevent character deaths because NPCs dont scale with you even though enemies do. The dungeons get very repetitive very quickly and can make the game pretty boring once you play enough of it.

In 2006 I was coming off several years of intensely worshipping Morrowind and found the altered combat mechanics (more FPS than RPG) annoying, I mised the lore, the long conversations and the mandatory walking and pathfinding. But now after playing Fallouts, Skyrim, Dying Light and other modern shooter RPGs, the game feels just right. It mostly comes down to general ambience. I appreciate the game world a lot more now than I did 17 years ago. I like the serene walks along the country roads, gathering potion  ingredients, figthing bandits along the way. I like the settlements, the quests, the geography of Cyrodiil with it's different regions and people. Ok, enough waxing. 
The game shows its age here and there, but overall it's a fine experience.

The main focus in Oblivion is the story and quests, not the combat system. Although there are combat moments in the game, and they are quite satisfactory, this is not the aspect of the game to focus on. Instead, the game engages you in numerous quests, each with its unique style.

Oblivion's soundtrack is unparalleled. Tracks like ""Wings of Kynareth"", ""Harvest Dawn"", and ""King and Country"" have become particularly famous. They perfectly reflect the world of Cyrodiil and can induce nostalgia in those who have spent many hours in the game.

However, the game is not without flaws. The auto-leveling system, which was supposed to ensure the player's constant development, turned out to be less than ideal. Many players consider it broken, as it can lead to situations where enemies become too powerful compared to the player.

What I'm saying is that I don't like Oblivion Gates and dungeons. They all look the same. They give me a headache whenever I have to go into either of them. 

The rest of Oblivion is pretty fire though, area design-wise.

I honestly like Oblivion's levelling system, I just wish the enemies didn't scale quite as much as you level up. Even if you know what you're doing, you will probably eventually reach a point where many of the enemies you face are just bullet(or arrow or sword slash)sponges. 

Apparently Bethesda gave Patrick Stewart a 90 page document outlining Uriel (?) Septim, a character who dies after the first 5 minutes of the game. They did this, but then had the rest of the voice actors read their lines in alphabetical order instead of in conversational batches. It makes most dialogue sound a little awkward and some dialogue sound extremely awkward. 

This fun fact, along with the graphics, soundtrack, physics system, and like a billion other subsystems in the game, end up making playing Oblivion feel like you're playing through a dream. I really like this vibe, I think that it scratches a really weird and really niche itch that no other game can scratch. 

Also, significantly better writing than Skyrim.

This game still holds up 17 years later. Easily one of the best RPG games ever made. Highly recommended.

Pros: 
- The guilds in this game are second to none. The Dark Brotherhood and Thieves Guild quest lines in particular hold up as superb.
- Everything is very pretty and vibrant. Even the more decayed areas still have an eye-catching colour palette.
- The main story is pretty good. Not amazing, but about what you’d expect for a Bethesda game.
- The DLC stories are even better.
- It’s just…fun. Easy to get lost in.
- Hasn’t everyone always wanted an obsessive fan?

Cons:
- The combat is whatever. Even for 2007 it was whatever. 
- The random NPC dialogue is bland.

While the game may not hold up well in terms of visuals compared to modern titles, its charm lies in its immersive world and captivating gameplay.

One aspect that disappointed me was the limited and buggy controller support. To fully enjoy the game, I had to use both the keyboard and controller simultaneously since some game mechanics weren't compatible with the controller. This inconvenience made me question the usefulness of using a controller with the game. If you're a fan of using controllers, you might find this aspect frustrating.

However, for die-hard fans of The Elder Scrolls franchise, revisiting Oblivion can be a rewarding experience. The game's vast open world, rich lore, and engaging quests still manage to captivate players even after all these years. Exploring the detailed landscapes, encountering unique characters, and embarking on epic adventures are still as thrilling as ever.

One of the game's redeeming qualities is the extensive modding community that has flourished over the years. The NexusMods platform offers a plethora of free mods that can enhance and customize your Oblivion experience. With the user-friendly Vortex mod manager, even those with limited technical knowledge can easily install mods. This allows players to tailor the game to their preferences and breathe new life into the aging graphics and gameplay mechanics.

Overall, if you're an Elder Scrolls fan, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is worth a replay. Despite its outdated graphics and limited controller support, the game's immersive world and captivating gameplay make it a worthwhile experience. The availability of free mods further extends its longevity, allowing players to customize their adventures and add fresh content to the game.",1678478602,1687570408,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

From the moment I stepped into the vibrant world of Cyrodiil, I was transported to a realm of magic, adventure, and limitless possibilities. This personal review is a testament to the profound impact this game had on me and countless other adventurers.

As I emerged from the dark and eerie prison cell, I was immediately captivated by the breathtaking beauty of Cyrodiil. The rolling hills, dense forests, shimmering lakes, and bustling cities painted a picturesque landscape that begged to be explored. The attention to detail in the world design was nothing short of awe-inspiring, with every nook and cranny holding hidden secrets, treasure-filled dungeons, and intriguing characters awaiting discovery.

The freedom of choice offered in Elder Scrolls: Oblivion was liberating. I could be the valiant hero, the sneaky thief, or the masterful mage, forging my own path through the rich tapestry of quests and storylines. The main questline, centered around the mysterious Oblivion Gates and the threat they posed to Tamriel, kept me on the edge of my seat as I unraveled the intricacies of the Daedric realms and their influence on the mortal plane.

But it was the seemingly endless array of side quests that truly made Oblivion shine. From helping the desperate citizens of towns and villages to joining various guilds and rising through their ranks, each quest felt like a story in itself. Whether it was infiltrating a secret society of assassins, embarking on a perilous treasure hunt, or saving a town from a vampire infestation, the world of Oblivion was teeming with captivating tales that wove together to form a tapestry of epic proportions.

The NPCs of Oblivion breathed life into the world. Each character had their own personality, desires, and fears, making interactions feel genuine and immersive. Engaging in conversations with the denizens of Cyrodiil often revealed intriguing details, quests, or even unexpected friendships. I still recall the witty banter of Sheogorath, the Daedric Prince of Madness, whose unpredictable nature added a delightful touch of chaos to the game.

Combat in Oblivion, while not as refined as later entries in the series, offered a satisfying blend of strategic decision-making and visceral action. Whether I wielded a sword, cast powerful spells, or unleashed arrows from the shadows, the battles felt engaging and rewarding. The character progression system allowed for deep customization, allowing me to mold my character's skills and attributes to suit my preferred playstyle.

The world-building in Oblivion extended beyond its landscapes and characters, with a hauntingly beautiful musical score that perfectly captured the essence of each location. The soaring melodies and haunting melodies added depth to the already immersive experience, evoking a wide range of emotions as I journeyed through the diverse regions of Cyrodiil.

That being said, Oblivion was not without its flaws. The character models and facial animations, while decent for their time, felt dated compared to modern standards. Occasional bugs and glitches could disrupt the flow of gameplay, although they were relatively minor and did not significantly impact my overall enjoyment.

Elder Scrolls: Oblivion remains a shining example of the power of immersive open-world RPGs. Its vast, enchanting world, engaging quests, and endless opportunities for exploration continue to resonate with players to this day. It's a game that ignited my passion for the Elder Scrolls series and left an indelible mark on my gaming journey.

In conclusion, Elder Scrolls: Oblivion is a monumental journey that captured the hearts and imaginations of players worldwide. Its influence on the genre cannot be overstated, as it set a new standard for open-world RPGs and solidified The Elder Scrolls franchise as a powerhouse in the gaming industry.

The sheer scale of the game was staggering. From the towering Imperial City to the mystical realm of the Shivering Isles, each location was meticulously crafted, immersing players in a world teeming with lore, history, and diverse cultures. Exploring the vast countryside, stumbling upon hidden caves, and stumbling upon ancient ruins filled me with a sense of wonder and discovery. The attention to detail in every nook and cranny made the world feel alive and constantly rewarding to explore.

The depth of character customization in Oblivion was remarkable. From choosing a race and class to fine-tuning skills and attributes, every decision shaped the gameplay experience. Whether I wanted to become a master swordsman, a cunning thief, or a powerful mage, the game accommodated my choices and allowed for dynamic character growth. The ability to level up and progress in various guilds and factions provided a sense of purpose and accomplishment, further enhancing the immersive nature of the game.

The narrative of Oblivion was rich and engrossing. The main questline, which thrust players into the role of the fabled hero destined to save the realm from the Daedric invasion, was epic in scale and filled with unexpected twists and turns. Interacting with iconic characters such as Martin Septim, the last heir to the Empire, and the enigmatic Blades agents added depth and emotional weight to the overarching story. The sense of urgency and impending doom drove me forward, eager to unravel the mysteries and confront the forces threatening Tamriel.

The side quests in Oblivion were where the game truly shined. Each quest felt meticulously crafted, offering memorable characters and captivating storylines. Whether I was assisting a troubled ghost seeking redemption or embarking on a journey to recover lost artifacts, these quests were engaging and left a lasting impression. The choices I made had consequences, branching the narrative and shaping the world around me, further adding to the game's replayability and depth.

Combat in Oblivion was a blend of real-time action and strategic decision-making. Engaging in sword fights, casting powerful spells, or utilizing archery required skill and tactics. While the combat mechanics may have felt somewhat clunky compared to more modern releases, the variety of weapons and spells at my disposal kept the battles engaging and enjoyable.

The soundtrack of Oblivion was a symphony of enchanting melodies that heightened the game's atmosphere. From the haunting choir in the iconic theme to the stirring orchestral pieces that accompanied exploration and combat, the music perfectly captured the essence of each moment, immersing me deeper into the world and evoking a wide range of emotions.

However, Oblivion did have its fair share of technical issues. Occasional graphical glitches, AI quirks, and quest bugs could hamper the experience. While these issues were relatively minor and did not detract significantly from the overall enjoyment, they were noticeable and occasionally frustrating.

In conclusion, Elder Scrolls: Oblivion stands as a landmark title in the realm of open-world RPGs. Its immersive world, intricate storytelling, and countless hours of exploration and adventure make it a masterpiece in its own right. Despite its technical imperfections, Oblivion's enduring legacy is a testament to its ability to transport players to a realm of fantasy and wonder. It remains a must-play game for anyone seeking a truly immersive and unforgettable RPG experience.",1626370096,1687288420,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Released when I was just 16 years old, Oblivion was a game that captivated me with its groundbreaking graphics, immersive gameplay, and intricate NPC AI schedules. As an open-world role-playing game, it offered an unparalleled sense of freedom, allowing players to embark on countless side-quests, interact with diverse NPCs, and shape their character's destiny. The game seamlessly blended combat, magic, and stealth skills, offering a wide range of possibilities for character development. In this review, I will delve into the significant gameplay features, plot points, and their interconnectedness, showcasing how Oblivion made a lasting impact on the RPG genre.

[h1]Gameplay and Character Development[/h1]
At the heart of Oblivion's gameplay was character development. Players were given the choice to select one of ten races, each with its own unique abilities, and customize their appearance. The game introduced the concept of major and minor skills, with major skills being crucial for leveling up. As players improved their major skills by ten points, they gained the opportunity to enhance their attributes and unlock new abilities related to the skill.

The game's 21 skills were divided into three categories: combat, magic, and stealth. Combat skills encompassed the use of heavy weapons, while magic skills allowed players to manipulate the physical world, control minds, summon creatures, and heal wounds. Stealth skills emphasized cunning, enabling players to crack locks, manipulate NPCs through speech, and engage in stealthy combat. The game world offered various tools and equipment, such as weapons, spells, and lockpicks, which players could acquire through purchase, theft, or looting.

Oblivion presented players with the choice of playing in either a first- or third-person perspective, except in the mobile phone version where an isometric projection was the only option. The level of difficulty could be adjusted at any time, allowing players to fine-tune the game to their preference. The heads-up display constantly provided crucial information about the character's health, magicka (used for spells), and fatigue. Managing these resources through rest, spells, and potions played a vital role in ensuring the character's effectiveness in combat.

[h1]Dynamic World and Level Scaling[/h1]
The world of Oblivion was teeming with diverse enemies, ranging from fantastical creatures like imps and goblins to natural predators like bears and wolves. One of the game's notable features was level scaling, which ensured that enemies and equipment became more challenging and powerful as the player leveled up. This mechanic aimed to maintain a consistent level of difficulty throughout the game, but it also drew criticism due to potential imbalances. Some players discovered that leveling certain skills too quickly resulted in disproportionately difficult enemies.

[h1]Plot and Narrative[/h1]
Set in the province of Cyrodiil during the Third Era, Oblivion followed the events of The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind but was not a direct sequel. The game's narrative commenced with the player character imprisoned for an unknown crime. Emperor Uriel Septim VII, accompanied by the Blades, the Imperial bodyguards, arrived in the prison seeking an escape route from assassins who had murdered his sons. In a twist of fate, the emperor is slain, but not before entrusting the player with the Amulet of Kings, a critical artifact tied to the barrier to Oblivion.

The main questline revolved around closing the gates to Oblivion, which had been opened due to the lack of a legitimate heir to Uriel Septim. The player's mission was to find Martin, an illegitimate son of the emperor, and aid him in reclaiming the throne, relighting the Dragonfires, and ending the Daedric invasion. Throughout the journey, the player encountered various factions, including the Mythic Dawn, a cult dedicated to the Daedric Prince of Destruction, Mehrunes Dagon. The cult played a significant role in the assassination of Uriel Septim and the theft of the Amulet of Kings.

The questline took players to various locations, including the city of Kvatch, which had been devastated by Daedra. The player had to close an Oblivion Gate to reclaim the city and persuade Martin, who survived the attack, to join the cause. As the Hero of Kvatch, the player returned to Weynon Priory, only to find it under attack, leading to a series of events that culminated in Martin being recognized as the emperor. The player, now part of the Blades, embarked on a quest to retrieve the stolen amulet from the Mythic Dawn, ultimately confronting their leader, Mankar Camoran.

The climax of the game unfolded in the Imperial City, where the player and Martin fought against the Daedric forces and Mehrunes Dagon himself. In a sacrifice to save Tamriel, Martin shattered the Amulet of Kings, merging with the spirit of Akatosh and becoming his avatar. Together, they defeated Dagon and closed the gates to Oblivion, securing the future of Tamriel.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Oblivion, with its impressive graphics, revolutionary NPC AI schedules, and immersive gameplay, set a new standard for open-world RPGs. The intricate character development system, dynamic world, and interconnected plot points created a truly immersive experience. While the game faced criticism for its level-scaling mechanics, it remains a landmark title in the RPG genre. Even now, reflecting back on my experience with Oblivion as a 16-year-old, it continues to hold a special place in my heart as a game that captured my imagination and provided countless hours of exploration and adventure.",1687218090,1687218090,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I love this game so much, because it's so broken but in a way you are free to take advantage of, and even encouraged to, with a difficulty slider that simply adds or subtracts enemy health/damage values.

Take heed of the crashes, though. If you're not good at dealing with them or identifying causes, you'll be unable to enjoy the experience. It happens most frequently due to age of the game and conflicts with modern GPU drivers/default settings. Use NVProfileInspector, and load the Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion profile(as written there) which is built-in to the driver package, and that sets most everything in a fashion so as to not crash on loading areas. 

It still crashes sometimes, but doing this rules out the graphics processes, leading me to conclude that it's a miracle that I can even play it today. 

Pro tip: throw a few hard-to-level skills into your class, so your character level climbs super slowly, allowing you to get other skill-ups that contribute to attribute gains upon leveling up, maximizing the benefits of leveling up. In other words, never level up until you've earned +5 in 3 attributes worth of skill-ups. +5 requires 10 skill-ups of constituent schools(for strength, +1 blunt, +2 blade, +7 hand to hand would give +5 strength as a choice upon leveling up, if those skill-ups occurred after the prior level) - It's quite difficult to optimize this, and perhaps completely unnecessary, but its a fairly obscure way to optimize against the leveled lists of the game, and if you neglect this, level 25+ will kick your ass.",1687023576,1687023576,True,19,0,0.681450307369232178,1,True,False,False

chamber i wait for you there where we last met countless ages ago come to me through fire and war i welcome you welcome moon and star i have prepared a place for you come bring wraithguard to the heart chamber together let us free the cursed false gods welcome Nerevar together we shall speak for the law and the land and shall drive the mongrel dogs of the empire from morrowind is this how you honor the sixth house and the tribe unmourned come to me openly and not by stealth it began here it will end here have you any parting words or would you prefer to skip the speeches and get to our business you are the challenger here after all so to you goes the courtesy of the first blow now that you have come to me here there can be but one result many times i have considered offering to share this place with you i considered offering to accept your oath of service you might try to buy my trust by giving me wraithguard keening and sunder i thought we might once again be friends comrades brothers in arms but i have won this place and power by right of conquest by right of daring and enterprise i will not risk it to cunning and deceit i offer you no deals if you are my enemy i cannot trust you and even if you are not my enemy i cannot let you live it wall all be decided here i believe i will prevail but i cannot be so sure and i am vain enough that should i fall i would wish to be remembered in my own words so if you have final questions you would ask ask them now i have final questions i would ask you if you would answer my first question is are you really Nerevar reborn that is bitter the gods and fates are cruel i served you faithfully once lord Nerevar and you repaid me with death i hope this time it will be you who pays for your faithlessness my second question is if you win what do you play to dow with the power from the heart will you make yourself a god and establish a thearchy or will you complete akulakhan and dispute control of tamriel with the septims or will you share the heart with your followers as i have and breed a new race of divine immortals you will follow the model of the tribunal that is a dull and unenterprising ambition see what the tribunal have done theyve sacrificed honour and dignity of the dunmer race and handed over our ancient land to the mongrel dogs of the empire you may mean well but you lack vision you are not worthy of the heart my final question is if i had offered to let you join me would you have surrendered wraithguard sunder and keening to me to seal your oath thank you for your forthright response and now if you have any questions ask them otherwise you are the challenger i await your first blow i will continue to draw divine power from the heart and distribute it to my kin and followers i will continue to broadcast divine power upon the blight winds so that it will touch each soul on vvardenfell and then more broadly across the waters to the rest of morrowind and tamriel in time every mortal in tamriel shall feel the liberating contact with the divine the sixth house will serve as the elite cadre of our movement as cultists evolve through various stages of enlightenment they will become as suits their abilities either holy warriors or priests their duty is to prepare themselves for service their joy and liberation is to enter even more deeply into the profound enlightenment of the divine dreamworld i will free the dunmer from the imperial yoke and cast down the false gods of the temple i will lead them out of their ancient superstitions and gift them with intimate knowledge of the divine then perhaps when morrowind is once again restored to its ancient glories it will be time to consider whether the dunmer should cultivate ambitions of empire if by my crimes you mean the inevitable suffering and destruction caused by war then i accept the burden of leadership the sixth house cannot be restored without war enlightenment cannot grow without the risk of upsetting the tradition bound and complacent herd and the mongrel armies of the empire cannot be expelled from morrowind without bloodshed as i have charity and compassion i grieve but our mission is just and noble i have no idea what happened to the dwemer i have been denied the opportunity to study wraithguard and i am not sure how much of kragenacs lore was invested in his tools and how much in his own sorcery and mastery i have long studied kragenac and have come to admire his wisdom and craft someday after the campaigns of the sixth house are secure i hope to have time to dedicate to this mystery akulakhan will serve three purposes first it will be the champion of my armies liberating first vvardenfell then morrowind and then perhaps the rest of tamriel second it will serve as a sower and cultivator of the divine substance derived from the heart three it will serve as the prominent banner and symbol of our cause to defy the empire to liberate mortals from ancient superstitions and to glorify our crusade against the gods oh please Nerevar spare me i surrender i surrender ha ha ha ha ha farewell sweet Nerevar better luck on your next incarnation this is getting tiresome you are a stubborn thing Nerevar come on ha ha ha ha oh dear forgive me but i am enjoying this what a fool you are im a god how can you kill a god what a grand and intoxicating innocence how could you be so

I actually like a lot of the features in this game more than in Skyrim. Lockpicking feels like it's a skill you can actually learn and not just random chance that you can waste perk points making less random. The voice acting is insane compared to Skyrim. So many people in that game sound so tired and unenthused. Oblivion's characters are the complete opposite. Exploration is more fun when you don't have a giant white arrow pointing you exactly where you need to go at all times. I can see why people don't love the persuasion minigame, but I kinda love having little minigames like that that I can use to gain certain characters' favor to then get different chat options out of them or even haggle for better trade prices. The level up system is also much better than in Skyrim in my opinion. First, it gives you a reason to sleep. Second, leveling up in Skyrim, especially at higher levels, sucks when you can only choose a single perk among like two dozen perk trees. In Oblivion, you can level up three ""perk trees"" (they're not perk trees in Oblivion but they're what turned into them in Skyrim) and each of those perks will often have several points added instead of just one. The magic systems in both Oblivion and Skyrim have their merits, but there is something I like very much about being able to have a specific spell hotkeyed that I can use at any time while having my main weapons equipped (Skyrim kinda has this with shouts, but it has a long cooldown compared to what you can do in Oblivion with magicka and a few potions). The music in both games is perfect for different reasons. There's not really much reason to compare these, one is emulating a rural nordic sound and the other is going for a bombastic imperial sound (though some of Oblivion's cave music makes me feel like Indiana Jones).
I'm not sure what my point is anymore, so let me get back to that. Oblivion is good. If you like Skyrim and you want that but with more freedom, complexity, and apparently better quests (I can attest that the earlier story quests are better imo than Skyrim's, but I'm excited to get to the later ones like the Dark Brotherhood and other faction questlines that people have been telling me about for years now), I think it's worth a shot.

Finding the ideal (for you) character configuration is quite challenging and there is always something new to learn about how to get the best from your character.  (I had several false starts initially until I found a character configuration which suited me and, also,  working out how best to approach the game environment.)

On the negative side, there are several bugs which vary from amusing to somewhat annoying, but, so far (1000+hours) I have found none which are game breaking or which, for me, ""have"" to be fixed with a mod.
Because, and this is personal, even in a game I cannot bring myself to commit murder I am, by personal choice, excluded from one major quest line - The Dark Brotherhood.  Some of the scripts, question lines and cut scenes go on too long for my liking and so break immersion.

People whine and moan about the graphics, faces, and the voice acting, and while there IS some truth to that, the good heavily outweighs the bad; and even then, some of the odd quirks of the bad, adds to the charm. 

Oblivion and Daggerfall are tied for first place, in terms of how much I love them, when stacked up against the other TES titles. (Morrowind taking a not-so-close second).

People claim the combat is too floaty and lacks impact, which is genuinely bollocks.
If you're spamming Mouse 1 without a care in the world, then I suppose yes, it can feel that way, when analyizing footage.
However, if you don't play the game like a lobotomized AI, and use the tools at your disposal, you quickly find that it is a much better combat system than people give it credit for.

And of course, the questlines are among the best in the series.
Any equivalent faction quest (and the main quest too), in Skyrim - Oblivion does better.

The game was released between Morrowind and Skyrim and most aspects of the game also lay between. 
I'll start with the bad:

-BLOOM! Oh my goodness, I guess Devs back in the mid 00's thought Bloom could fix anything and everything, it looks terrible and is likely one of the worst parts of the game.

-The AI was good for it's day, but can be a little annoying and frustrating at times to fight. The block/stagger mechanic of the game isn't great and the AI takes full advantage of this at all times. 

-The dialogue isn't anywhere near as good as Morrowind or Skyrim. Oblivion is full voice acted, which is fantastic over the text boxes of Morrowind, but the writing isn't anywhere near as good, however the voice acting isn't as good as Skyrim, again an in between.

-Though the Magic System is amazing, it isn't quite as good as Morrowinds magic spell creation system and you have to constantly go into your inventory to switch spells as there are no hot keys.

-Lastly, it was designed to be used on the Xbox 360 and like a lot of these games, the Cities and other built up areas are all enclosed by walls and doors, giving you lots of load screens!

Good stuff:

-The story is solid, personally I liked it better than Skyrim!

-The Magic system is top notch! You can effectively cast spells while armored and carrying a two handed weapon or sword and board. So your fighting style won't block your spells!

-The combat and AI were pretty top notch for the day and still hold up except where I mentioned above.

-The music lands the mood of this game very well!

-The lighting, I actually think Oblivion has the best lighting out of all the TES games! There had been plenty of times I've been searching a dungeon and I'd have some big bad come out of the darkness like a horror game jump scare! You don't get that in Skyrim! 

I know I've mentioned more bad than good, however the good is story, combat and magic, which is 90% of the game over all! The bad stuff is simply from observation over the years.

It's a vast world brimming with deep, enthralling quests and lore. Despite being released in 2006, the graphics and artstyle are still impressive today. The soundtrack by Jeremy Soule is legendary and features some of the most incredible music I've ever heard in my life. In many ways, this game even outshines Skyrim. Although the combat system could be more elaborate, it is still enjoyable and captivating.

I love this game to death. Oblivion has had a significant impact on my life and who I am today. As a child attending elementary school, Oblivion introduced me to the English language. Since there was no Czech localization for many years, I was compelled to improve my English profoundly. Spending my summer holidays with Oblivion helped me become the top student in my English class. I have been studying and adoring the language ever since. To this very day, I continue to learn new expressions from Oblivion. I believe many gamers have had similar experiences with their English improving after playing tons of games. I'm just inspired to take this knowledge to the next level and possibly even dedicate my career to English, my native Czech language, or the digitally infinite marvel called natural/human language.

I am forever grateful to Bethesda for creating this masterpiece. Thanks to this game, I found true love.

My inaugural venture into Tamriel occurred through the auspicious medium of ES V Skyrim. After completing every quest and succumbing to an inevitable ennui, I resolved to embark upon the path of Oblivion. ES IV Oblivion boasts a myriad of NPCs, a profusion of architectural marvels, and quests of unparalleled grandeur. Nevertheless, one must concede that its graphical prowess fails to surpass that of Skyrim. It is pertinent to note that I commenced my journey with the aid of mods, thus regrettably rendering me oblivious to the vanilla experience. I can confidently assert that this augmented state of gameplay remains entirely viable, thereby enhancing the overall immersion. Notwithstanding, I have a penchant for assuming the role of the ""chosen one,"" and Skyrim captivated my attention expeditiously, as I assumed the mantle of the Dragonborn from the very outset, imbued with an inescapable sense of destiny. Conversely, although the position of Hero of Kvatch afforded a modicum of gratification, the overarching narrative primarily revolved around Martin, leading to a partial loss of interest. Moreover, it is worth mentioning that the breathtaking expanse of Cyrodiil rivals the sublime beauty of Skyrim, albeit bereft of snow, it nevertheless exudes an unparalleled ambiance. To summarize, I wholeheartedly recommend immersing oneself in the enchanting world of Oblivion or even delving into the Elder Scrolls' antecedent installments such as Morrowind, Daggerfall, and even Arena.

I kept myself limited to more vanilla-oriented mods since it's not really fair to review a game that's been practically rewritten from scratch. Also I wanted to actually play Oblivion, and not some version of it that's been changed nearly beyond recognition.)

By far the worst Elder Scrolls game imo. Everything feels far more artificial than even Morrowind before it. I felt no atmosphere when trying to get into this one. There's a whole lot wrong with it but I'm gonna just give some bullet points.

-Enemies, and the player, are super spongey. Combat is an awful unchallenging slog, and was never fun. Enemies healing themselves makes this even more annoying.

-Every single face in this game is butt-ugly. All NPC's blend together a lot as well due to similar designs, and only having like 5 voice actors. It's nearly impossible to tell who's an important NPC and who's just a random citizen. Even Morrowind did this better, and Skyrim as well.

-Scaling is all kinds of wack. The difference between a damage skill at 0 and 100 is only 50%. Just... really? As a result of this, combat never stops being the slog it already was.

-Wandering around in these games usually results in finding some pretty cool stuff. But in my attempts to do so in this entry, all I found were dull-as-frick caves and dungeons. No stories, no interesting landmarks, nothing.

-The menus are just, ehhhh. I especially dislike how unorganized the quest menu feels. And the map has no zoom. There's also no way to view the perks you have, including ones you aren't even told you acquired by starting a skill at a high enough level. Quality design there, lol.

-This game also has an earlier attempt at the world scaling that Skyrim eventually got right. This issue is pretty infamous, but bandits will end up with glass armor by the end of the game, and multiple entire enemy types disappear from the spawn pools completely. As mentioned earlier, the world here feels more artificial to me than anything else BGS has put out, and stuff like this is a huge reason why.

Out of every Elder Scrolls game, this one certainly feels the most generic and dull. Everything is exactly what you would expect from a medieval fantasy setting. There's no cool spins or twists on the genre. It's all your typical fantasy guff, and wow is it fricking boring. In regards to gameplay, it's like a strange limbo between the more raw RPG style of Morrowind, and the more streamlined style of Skyrim. Except it completely flops in both categories.

The verdict? Game sux.

I would recommend Morrowind or Skyrim instead. Depending on if you want a more hardcore type of RPG, or a more accessible one.",1684894310,1684922581,False,15,2,0.589541316032409668,0,True,False,False

Walking into random Waterfront huts and talking to the random NPCs in there I encountered unique dialogues and back stories (3 siblings down on their luck working at the docks, but one of them only works as much as he gets paid while the others call him lazy, a dog, and a pig). In Morrowind, it's the same exact greeting and responses when talking to random NPCs.

I cannot help but mention the epiphany that hit me while playing this game after so many years and right after Morrowind. It overwhelmingly feels like Morrowind was the test vehicle for Bethesda to commit to a larger and fully realized project that would be realized through Oblivion. They took Morrowind to the nth degree and fully fleshed out. 

Especially important to note that because Bethesda managed to roll this out in 2007, Oblivion does not suffer from the mediocrity of balancing, oversimplying and streamlining gameplay, or the mainstream overcorrection of optimizing the fun out of the game that came later with Skyrim.

Also, each house you enter here feels unique. The towns feel different. The stories in each town are different. Even the random NPC houses you enter are intricately decorated and furnished, prime examples of medieval fantasy houses. Morrowind had cookie cutter barren houses that were bland, boring, and clearly filler material to give the illusion that the empty world of Morrowind isn't empty.",1684900201,1684900201,True,1,0,0.49325898289680481,0,True,False,False

This Game came in Standard, Collectors & Deluxe Editions when it was first released. As for the Story, Tamriel enters the last hours of the Third Age & the Gates of Oblivion are approaching. Once again, you play as a convicted inmate ready to be shaped into whatever character you want with its new Character Modding Tools. Like Daggerfall & Arena, the Imperial Prison acts as the Tutorial Section where you select your Birthsign and Character Class, or make your own Class. Then after you carry out the Emperor Septim's Last Request to protect the Amulet of Kings, the world opens up entirely.

Like Morrowind, you're free to do what you want. Play the Main Story, Side Stories, Join any Faction (Hero or Dark), wander around, just to name a few such as buying a house or horse.

Oblivion has more Dynamic Settings than Morrowind such as Shop Hours and NPC Schedules. A New Leveling System where enemies scale to your levels where the stronger you are, the stronger the enemies are. Still, you better not break into any Closed Shops during Nightfall, the NPCs will call for the guards and you'll be arrested for breaking & entering, trespassing, etc crimes.

Elder Scrolls 4 also has an All-Star Voice Cast which makes the game suit its Triple A Game Status for Generation 7 Consoles & PCs. However, Elder Srcolls 4 had plenty of DLC & Updates. But the First one was a Re-Rating from T to M in 2006 as locked coding like GTA San Andreas were accessed through modding in the PC Version, Wizard's Tower, Shivering Islands & Knights of the Nine DLC along with Horse Armor. In 2006, DLC was new at the time along with In-Game Purchases that you would find in Mobile Games later on as a sign of things yet to come.

The Final Version being the GOTY Deluxe or 5th Anniversary Edition was released in 2011 offers the complete Oblivion Experience until Skyrim arrived bringing the whole ""My Precious"" & ""One Elder Scrolls Game to Rule them All, One Elder Scrolls Game to Find them, One Elder Scrolls Game to Bring them All and then the Darkness binds them."" to The Elder Scrolls Series, months later after the Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion 5th Anniversary Edition.",1684334157,1684348648,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. Loaded into the game world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

To get the full experience, this needs to be either Steam or some other PC-based approach; modding is really a must, both for bug fixes, and for graphical improvements. Beyond that there is, of course, also a legion of new options.

The game has a star-studded cast with Patrick Stewart, Sean Bean, and Terence Stamp. The main quest is intriguing, but leaves plenty of room for the main point of the game, which is to explore and get involved in this world that has been created for you.

It's less RPG style than it's predecessor, Morrowind, There is much less reliance on text menus, and the replacement UI is consolidated, the text enlarged, and looks like ink on paper. Doubtless a consideration for consoles in that design.

There's a great deal more voice acting, but not for the player character, who just makes noise when in pain plus makes ""effort"" sounds.

The graphics are a lot better than Morrowind, and can look convincing at times. From 2023's standpoint, it's hopelessly outdated, but it's a nice looking game that can look a lot nicer with some modding. The Colovian Highlands at sunset on horseback is something that you didn't know you needed.

The character creation face design interface is quite detailed, but is limited by how faces are done in the game. They're all a little funny looking, and yours will be, too. It was a joy to get into when it first came out, but this is an area where it's particularly dated now (2023).

Instead of Dwemer ruins, we have Ayleid ruins, which are more traditionally Elvish. This has been a knock on the game: that it hews too closely to the look of traditional sword and sorcery genre fare, rather than the more unique material of the last game. I'd say there's truth to that, and maybe it's me playing Morrowind later, but it didn't bother me. It's an incredible world that they've built for Oblivion. Some of it gets repetitive, but I'd rather have that than a smaller world.

Where the game really shines, like all TES games and other Bethesda titles, is the ability to just go out and do whatever. 

Explore and add markers to your map. Join a faction. Harvest crops. Teach a highwayman better manners. Go swimming; catch a fish. Collect alchemical ingredients. Practice your skills. Get Armorer to the point where you can repair enchanted items. Accept minor quests from complete strangers because why not? Get a horse and go. Explore a dungeon. Loot it. Kill that skeleton with the bow who's been shooting you for the entire fight that you just finished. Cast area spells and get in trouble. Buy and furnish every available house. Waste a ridiculous amount of time mountain hopping for a ""shortcut."" Finally get enough Magicka to cast a spell you bought ages ago for too much gold. Accidentally select Reynald instead of Guilbert and get the ""celebrate"" line. Move on to a new character because you've played this one out.

The levelling isn't great. Essentially, it's possible to hopelessly mess up your game by winging it. There's a system, and if you want to max your attributes without cheating, you have to get on top of it. You need to at least be aware in order to prevent nerfing your character.

Levelling aside, the skills and attributes are still fun, and the guild quests are pretty good overall, with the occasionaly roughspot. There are a host of mini and micro quests, being a completist can take quite a long time. These are a mixed bag, but mostly good, and there are many gems that keep interest going.

My big takeaway is Cyrodil is a place where I like to be. The Planes of Oblivion themselves, not so much. I really only visit there long enough to get my fill of Transcendent Sigil Stones, mostly.

One of my favorite games of all time. I could say more, but it's time to get back in the game.

There you have it, Oblivion.

Jokes aside, it's one of my favourites when modded to hell, Vanilla though, it's got a lot of problems, biggest one is that's rather boring. Training is limited to 10 sessions per level, which is 5 Attribute points that you can at least pay for, the other 10 will need to be grinded for and of course that'll take ages to do. If you don't level well the enemies will be sure to show you the error of your ways and you'll be thanking Todd for including that difficulty slider.

The Quests really are the best part of this game, You can just stay at Level 1 and use quest related items to gear up, every quest line is a treat to go through for the most part, highlights being the Dark Brotherhood and Fighter's Guild. Shivering Isles is also the best DLC put out for a game I'd say.

Combat is now engaging unlike in the previous games that used dice rolls for everything. That said, combat boils down to you and your enemy waving your weapons like feather dusters hoping somebody will be staggered first. Oh, I should write this now, pump your Agility up unless you enjoy not playing the game when you're in a group combat scenario, take a shot when you get disarmed and knocked down from an arrow fired by a bandit you didn't see or when an Imperial Guard appears out of thin air to arrest you for stealing somebody's carrot.

Its main flaw is (obviously) graphics, the characters don't look very realistic or pleasant and apart from their heads and hands, their bodies are all one solid color, the signs are a little hard to read. But that flaw becomes a blessing very quickly to people with a sense of humor and plenty of time to spend on the character creation menu. 

Although, that's about my only problem with it. The factions are great, having fleshed out, full story-line Fighters, Mages, and Thieves guilds like Morrowind, as well as an arena (although unlike Morrowind it's an entire faction you can fight all the way to Grand Champion in) and the Dark Brotherhood. The other factions and DLC factions such as the Knights of the Nine were great too, each offering an interesting plot for your character to go through and another title to increase or decrease your Personality depending on the faction.

The pantheon of gods and Daedric princes your character can worship in the game are fun to me, too. The Nine Divines and their virtues are fun, and like I mentioned I loved the Knights of the Nine storyline, and I appreciate that you can be cured of diseases by praying at their altars. I also loved going around and doing the quests for each Daedric Prince, because the voice acting of each one and the personalized quests they sent me on added a lot of character to each one and made me understand other character's reasons for worshipping them. But the best part is that none of this is forced on you, and unlike Skyrim, you're not really banned from worshipping any given one. It's totally okay if, like Else God-Hater, you ""hate the gods. All gods. They can all bite my garters. And if you don't like it, YOU can bite my garters, too.""

I find it a little silly that at the end of the main quest, you're considered the Hero of Kvatch, and there's STILL no Emperor, but at no point do they think ""hmm, maybe this hero that's saved our lives and was the one responsible for tracking down the last Septim heir should be our new Emperor."" I get that for historical reasons leading into Skyrim, you can't have Martin Septim turn into a literal dragon and then just have some dude with no discernible features step in and be mediocre, but they could have at least added you to the Elder Council or something, maybe made you an advisor to a new Emperor. But not a huge deal, because I feel like most people end their playthroughs soon after beating the main quest.

All in all, an amazing game that I've poured almost 200 hours into at this point and will continue to play until I run out of free time to play it or TES VI comes out, whichever comes first. Give it a shot!",1683861418,1683861445,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Looking past the dated visuals, and 7 voice actors will make this a game to remember. The customization is so vast that it leaves room for multiple play-throughs. The world is huge, and full of caves and side missions that can get  a bit old. I would recommend playing on the lower difficulty level as higher difficulty just inflates enemy damage and HP, making fights a very tedious inconvenience. 
The freedom of playstyles lets this game feel alive with out you chose to interact with the world. Leveling up through playing is a clever way to keep players engaged. I do wish the magic was more reliable, but it is very impressive the vast array of spells in the game. The main story is very fun and was the last thing I did and was easily my favorite part. This is my first Elder Scrolls game and what a start it is. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who wants a 3D medieval open world with innumerable ways of approaching it.

I missed out on Oblivion while it was the newest Elder Scrolls because I was a World of Warcraft ONLY player back then. I did play Morrowind during its original release on og Xbox, but I played Skyrim to death before I tried to go back and play Oblivion and I'll admit, it was really difficult, outside of the writing, the game has not aged well at all. The animations are awful, the graphics are fuzzy, the physical combat looks silly especially when swinging 2-handed weapons, and the spellcasting is clunky. I freaking hated it initially, but I don't know what happened, over time I just got used to it and I love its goofy charm now. I especially love the npc's terrible AI, they do a lot of funny sh!t. And of course, the storytelling is top-notch, definitely superior to Skyrim's writing.

I've stopped playing it for the time being, though, because the Skyblivion mod is actually very close to completion, they're estimating around a year until release from what I could find, and it looks AWESOME. So hyped for it.

So anyway, I'm waiting for that to finally drop first before I complete the game, but I do recommend Oblivion in its current state. Not like it really matters, pretty much everyone who is interested in TES IV has played it already, but still, I wrote a review anyway.

The game has earned a reputation for its immersive world, deep lore, and engaging gameplay that keep players coming back for more.

One of the standout features of Oblivion is its expansive world that players can explore at their leisure. The game's open-world design allows players to traverse a vast landscape filled with unique environments, from lush forests to sprawling cities. The game's attention to detail is remarkable, and players can easily lose themselves in the game's world for hours on end.

The game's lore is also one of its strong points. The world of Oblivion is richly detailed, with an extensive history that players can discover through exploration and questing. The game's NPCs are also well-written and provide players with a wealth of information about the game's world and its inhabitants.

However, one area where Oblivion shows its age is its graphics. While the game was groundbreaking for its time, the graphics are undoubtedly dated by today's standards. Despite this, the game's art style still holds up, and the world is still beautiful to look at, even with its lower resolution textures.

Another area where the game could have improved is its story. While there are many quests to complete, some of them can feel like they go nowhere or lack satisfying conclusions. However, this is a minor issue when compared to the game's strengths.

In terms of gameplay, Oblivion is excellent. The game's combat system is intuitive, and players can choose from a variety of weapons and spells to customize their playstyle. The game's leveling system is also deep and provides players with a sense of progression and growth.

In conclusion, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is a classic RPG that still holds up today despite its dated graphics and some quests that feel unfulfilling. The game's immersive world, deep lore, and engaging gameplay make it a must-play for fans of the genre. Whether you're a long-time fan or a newcomer, Oblivion is an experience that you won't soon forget.",1682177110,1683562068,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

My son got this game from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

Memes aside, this game is a bonafide masterpiece, ive lost track of how many times ive played it since original launch on the 360. More recent versions of windows make the game a bit unstable (save often!) but you can edit the oblivion.ini file to increase the amount of ram the game can access - reducing crashes and improving framerate. I would also recommend Oblivion Mod Manager, if only for the mod that fixes peoples faces to look less like potatoes. 

As far as gameplay, the combat is vastly improved from Morrowind and has aged nicely. The ability to cast spells while wielding weapons makes this the ultimate battlemage simulator. The quests are absolute peak Bethesda, less fetching/escorting quests than Morrowind and better writing than Skyrim. Plus you get the added hilarity of npc dialogue and bugs to entertain you.

My first game on my first Velocity gaming rig in 2006 and one to remember in a lifetime! [b]Oblivion[/b] is more complex than the beloved [b]Skyrim[/b] we all know. You have to [b]repair your equipment[/b] via hammers or visit a vendor who can fix your stuff, or else it will break during battle, and you know what follows. More interactions with NPCs where you try and [b]befriend[/b] them with a neat little mini-game wheel! Doing that also improves better chances of bartering; yes, you get to [b]barter[/b] with your vendors!

The lockpicking mechanic is different from the modern style that Bethesda uses for Skyrim and their [b]Fallout[/b] series, which is (to me) plain and boring. In Oblivion, depending on the lock difficulty, you get a mini-game where you have to push down springs and, with the right timing, lock that spring in place until you get all the springs to unlock the door/chest/etc.

Animations are... clunky, but this is a classic unless you mod the game. Mods make a huge difference in [b]The Elder Scrolls[/b] series but like Skyrim, the modding community is thinning due to different circumstances. If you're not used to modding and would like to get into it, I recommend Skyrim since it's more modernized than this potato and far more accessible to mod than Oblivion.

Oh, the soundtrack... the Nostalgia! The tracks make you feel like you are in a different and immersive world! Sometimes it is daybreak, in-game, and real life that I forget I have something to do. Oblivion was the perfect game to lose myself back in its day. I'll stop the review here since I can continue with this game forever.

This is a Hit or Miss title, Not much to appreciate now with the next generation of gaming and demands, but I still recommend Oblivion for the storyline.

Here's my take on it.
First I am biased. Oblivion is THE game that started my long and storied video game passion. I discovered this game when I was 17, and realized there was an entire world of undiscovered adventure in video games. I'm 35 now and currently on my umpteenth play-through of it haha. I've grown up, started a career in the military, got married, adventured IRL across the world, experienced so many amazing and epic things, got divorced, and am currently about to retire from the military in little under five years. The entire time, This game and so many more have been with me both while playing them, and in my mind as I have walked IRL. Games like Oblivion have helped shape me as a person in many fundamental ways. But enough sob story let's talk about Oblivion!

First, even for a game released in 2006, it still holds its amazing wonder and epic beauty. Yeah, it's older, its 
NPCs and engine are dated. Even the dialogue is very dry sometimes lol. But it holds re-playable value quite well. It's a game I recommend any avid RPG lover play if they never have. 10/10 playable today for the first time and fully replayable.

Combat is very well done for the time and still is very playable today. It's dynamic, provides a cool third or first-person pov, and factors in all of your stats, both major and minor. 10/10 

The story is definitely epic. So many amazing characters involved, with Sean Bean as the primary NPC voice actor, and the story provides a struggle that makes you fully connect with the world at play. 10/10

Graphics are definitely very good for the time and hold up very well on modern machines. I play it on a 3080 with the latest ram and processing power and so on. For its age, 10/10

Dialogue has always been a bit dry in this game. the voice actors are re-used across many NPCs and the conversations with most can become repetitive. At the time, Bethesda was a lot smaller with a smaller budget and thus it really showed in the dialogue play. 5/10 for the dialogue itself, 10/10 for the nostalgic feels.

Questing is vast and takes you across the entire world. If you play every major and minor quest, you will see every inch of Tamriel in all its glory. 10/10 

DLC was always hit or miss. Knights of the Nine and Shivering Isles are definitely huge additions to the game that really brought their stories into the fold well. The rest is just fluff to me personally. 7/10 

Modding is very doable in this game. There are many many amazing mods that give new life to an already amazing game by so many modders. Many of them are absolute odes written and developed by gamers who clearly love the game and only wish to make it better than it already is. 10/10 for modability.

Overall, I give Oblivion a 9/10. It is an amazing game that is worthy of every gamer's chance to play through it at least once. I have countless hours on older machines lol. I've played it on every rig I've ever owned including PlayStation. RPGs truly are the root of all gaming, and Oblivion imo is one of the best of the best out there. I strongly encourage anyone who is interested in giving this game a run-through. 
Happy gaming and if you do, good luck on closing shut the jaws of Oblivion!",1682878284,1682878284,True,95,4,0.862486600875854492,4,True,False,False

Developed by Bethesda Game Studios, Oblivion takes place in the province of Cyrodiil, a land of forests, mountains, and ancient ruins, where players take on the role of a prisoner who is tasked with saving the realm from the evil forces that threaten to destroy it.

One of the game's standout features is its open-ended gameplay, which allows players to approach the game however they see fit. Players can choose to focus on the main questline, or they can explore the world at their leisure, engaging in side quests, interacting with NPCs, and discovering hidden treasures and secrets.

The game's combat system is also highly customizable, with a range of weapons, spells, and abilities that players can use to take on enemies. The game's leveling system is also unique, with players able to customize their character's skills and attributes to suit their playstyle.

Visually, the game is stunning, with a rich and detailed world that is both immersive and believable. The game's sound design is also exceptional, with a dynamic soundtrack that adds to the game's atmosphere and sense of adventure.

Overall, Oblivion is a classic RPG that still holds up today, offering players a rich and immersive world to explore and countless hours of gameplay. Whether you're a fan of the genre or new to the world of RPGs, Oblivion is a game that is definitely worth playing.",1682827843,1682827843,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is in many ways the perfect middle ground between Morrowind and Skyrim, and also has plenty of interesting qualities of its own. If I had to briefly describe the strengths of the game, I would say that for me it really boils down to:

1. Oblivion retains most of the RPG elements of Morrowind with none of the frustrating and clunky gameplay elements. It's really nice having a game with depth that gives you something to work towards if you want it but also handles in a relatively enjoyable manner. An actual class system with major skills, attributes, and birthsigns, lots of magical effects and stuff at your disposal, etc. make the RP aspect of it all plenty interesting, unlike Skyrim which dropped a ton of character building stuff. Magic is particularly fun in Oblivion which I really enjoy, but any playstyle is perfectly viable.

2. Oblivion's world is stunning. The landscape isn't super detailed by today's standards but it is still incredibly pretty, and the soundtrack supporting it is perfect as well. The cities are decent sized and well designed too. The dungeons are relatively simple but dark and moody, and not too long. The Shivering Isles expansion is fantastic looking also, and completely unique. Definitely my favorite world to be immersed in out of probably any game I've played.

3. The game is chocked full of really creative quests, and a lot of them take you into some really interesting hidden areas. And youre rarely forced to go into some generic dungeon for a quest, which is a breath of fresh air if you played Skyrim and didn't like that 75% of the quests in the game send you into some incredibly repetitive Nordic tombs. There are also a few different types of enemies that you can find inside dungeons in Oblivion, which makes them a little less monotonous despite the basic designs.

There are a few issues some people have with the game that I should mention also. One is the level scaling, and how difficult the tougher enemies you fight as you increase in level can be. The game is designed for you to make good use of the leveling system and increase your stat gains when you level up, so if you understand how the leveling system works then it won't be a problem (in fact, the really cool enemies you fight at higher levels make the scaling a good thing imo if you're prepared for it). But if you're wanting to play through more casually and not have to focus on your attributes as much then it may be a little frustrating unless you turn the difficulty down. Another thing is that the despite how good the environment looks, the NPCs do look a little odd and the random dialogue between them is pretty goofy. I've never been bothered by it much, but it's a turn-off for some people. The main quest sends you into several interdimensional gates that are neat the first couple times but get pretty old after that. I recommend leveling up a bit before doing them much so that you at least fight more interesting enemies inside, but it is a bit of a grind at times. Finally, a lot of people say the more archetypal medieval European setting of Oblivion is bland and boring, but I don't get that vibe at all. If anything it's nice that it's at least significantly different from the more rugged settings and themes of Morrowind and Skyrim, but the idyllic surface of the game is also a mask for some really dark and macabre areas and concepts underneath. 

Overall, I very highly recommend playing Oblivion. It is a little dated in some areas but it's a lot of fun and it's a game I love to be immersed in. If you enjoy developing a character, doing interesting and creative quests, and/or strolling through a gorgeous environment, then Oblivion's weaker areas won't bother you much and it will be an enjoyable experience.",1499742668,1682709337,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I cannot attest to how phenomenal this game is without sounding biased, because it's my favorite game, not just in the ES franchise, but in general. I'm unabashedly biased. As someone who has dumped countless hours into both Morrowind and begrudgingly into Skyrim; Oblivion is the best middle ground between the more traditional RPG elements of Morrowind, and the (excessive, borderline dumbing down) streamlining of Skyrim. Graphics for a 2006 title are actually pretty dope! Yes, there are a few NPC's that are, for lack of a better term, tragic looking, but honestly it isn't *TOO* bad, certainly nowhere near as severe an issue as people make it out to be.

Great soundtrack.
Though the combat is kinda clunky.

It's a shame they changed the quest and dialogue system. Morrowind is superior in this regard, not walking you through the game, but encouraging you to interact with all the NPCs to gather needed information.
In Oblivion, they adopted the generic dialogue system with voice acting, which limits the possible options of dialogue (most of the NPCs have only 3-5 options, of which at least 2 are practically useless, besides some character/setting flavor). Thus, most of the time you are forced to follow the markers on the map to finish the objective, since you can barely get any useful information or clues regarding the objective via dialogues.

The game's immersive world-building, rich lore, and engaging gameplay mechanics make it a standout experience that is hard to replicate.

One of the standout features of Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is the game's attention to detail in world-building. The game's vast open-world environment is packed with memorable characters, intricate quests, and hidden secrets that are waiting to be discovered. The game's visuals and sound design are also impressive, further immersing you in the game's world.

The gameplay mechanics in Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion are intuitive and enjoyable, with a wide range of character classes and abilities to choose from. The game's combat system is enjoyable but rough, and the game also features a unique leveling system that rewards you for using different skills and abilities.

Another feature of the whole Elder Scrolls series is the game's rich lore, which is both deep and complex. The game's numerous factions, each with their own unique storylines, provide a wealth of content for players to explore and enjoy.

As a fan of RPGs, I have played many games over the years, but only a few have ignited similar feelings to Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.

I played it for 3 or 4 hours back in 2007 on the Xbox, and put off playing it through until I had a few weeks of free time, and a computer advanced enough to really enjoy it.

Yes, I waited too long (16 years), but after reading so many articles by people saying how much better it was then even Skyrim, I wanted to do a deep dive into it.  It has flaws, and painful redundant moments of grinding if you want to be able to do certain things, but they aren't terrible. 

I installed 3 major mods, one graphics based, one for the interface, and one to fix bugs, so perhaps I'd have much bigger complaints if I didn't, but at this point it makes sense to install things that don't really change gameplay, only just improve the experience.

Instead of trying to 'finish' the game, I ended up starting the main quest, and then switching over to finishing all the individual guild quests. Several of these quests are considered the most fun things to do in the game.

My biggest struggle with the game is how it is a bit too hard in the beginning and a bit too easy at the end, due to the way your character's advance in levels. This is a well known problem so reading up on how to best maximize your stats and not level up too quickly is a requirement to being able to play it through well.",1681578935,1681578935,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,1,True,False,False

      Then i tried to shoot like 30 arrows between the gap lost 26 arrows cuz i couldn't also reach them neither. After that i tried to use the fireballs impact to yank it outta there. It kind of worked cuz i kinda made the stone push out from the back of the cover that i couldn't reach. Now i could fully see it but it was a little far away.I had 4 arrows left so i had to make it count. 
    I had to hit it straight behind the stone so the impact of the arrow would push the stone to me. I did it with my last arrow. Managed to get it somewhere closer where i could reach barely.

There's even some epic adventure at the heart of all that jank.

In terms of quality of play, this game is very easy to get lost in for hours, and is actually quite immersive, though I would recommend just playing with the brightness up, as some caves and dungeons can be very dark, and in-game lights don't add a whole lot.

I played Skyrim first, and I like this one better. Though to be fair, I am not playing Vanilla. I am now using the standard Through the Valleys mod collection. That out of the way, this game has more physics. Better quest design. Better level design. More advanced NPC technology. Even more complex game mechanics. For example, weapons actually need to be repaired, similar to Fallout 3 and New Vegas which I personally prefer to the way things are handled in Skyrim and Fallout 4. Lock-picking is also different, and more challenging. At first, I didn't like this older style of lock-picking but I am finally starting to get the hang of it (listen for the sound).

You have to remember it came after Morrowind but before Skyrim, so while it added a lot QoL changes after Morrowind it also lacks a lot of what Skyrim eventually came to offer.

So you've got your open world concept which is done well, lots of NPCs to mingle with, plenty of dungeons to plunder and explore, the map is quite large and although the game looks a bit rough these days, it still has a certain charm to it that I appreciate to this day.

It has easily the bests quests of any ES game, the mages guild quest line beats out every single quest in skyrim combined. The story in Oblivion is unmatched, not even Morrowind can tell a better story and I love Morrowind. The story of Oblivion makes you feel like a badass Daedra slayer without making you 'the chosen one' like in skyrim and Morrowind. Hell, you start off in some rinky-dink ass dungeon, and the only way you escape is because some old fart recognized you in his dream.

 While it becomes a drag in the later game, the combat is fun and streamlined, and it allows for more diverse play styles compared to skyrim. Oblivion isn't perfect, however; the AI and level scaling are absolutely horrendous. While the AI can be funny, the god-awful level scaling makes even the most experience player not want to level up.

But despite its flaws, Oblivion has the best Story, Quests, and some of the best combat in the Elder Scrolls.

After several aborted attempts, I finally managed to complete the game (or at least, the parts of it that I wanted to experience, which were the main quest, the Thieves Guild questline, and the Dark Brotherhood questline). My playtime reflects that, but you could easily get 80+ hours from this with a more thorough playthrough or multiple playthroughs. 
 
There are some things you may want to know before playing (especially with regard to how leveling works), outlined [url=https://beforeiplay.com/index.php?title=The_Elder_Scrolls_IV:_Oblivion]here[/url]. Detailed leveling explanation [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Leveling]here[/url].

As with most Bethesda games, the experience can be improved by mods. Everything from unofficial bug fix patches (that fix over 2,000 bugs), to UI improvements, and more. Console commands are also handy if/when glitches occur (e.g. ""tcl"" to toggle clippling if your character gets stuck). 

Note for Linux users: The game runs fine on Linux with Proton, however modding is a bit trickier. SteamTinkerLaunch supports the Vortex Mod Manager and makes modding easier.

I also didn't like at first the fact that the enemies evolve with the main character's level but the overall gameplay formula of this game is very good considering all the details of the game. 

I got some improvement in unusual performance issues with the old ""Shutter Remover"" mod and there are also unofficial paths in the form of community mods that propose to fix some bugs in the game.

The most obvious problem with this game is the fact that the HDR option is broken (causes a blue screen ingame, you can't see anything else) at the moment, without using any fixes, and this HDR if I remember correctly is marked as default in the game's high quality option, which can lead to many cases of a new player getting to know the game right away with a problem right at the beginning.

Recommended if you like some gameplay detail that is in this ""Oblivion"" that is not in ""Skyrim"" or also for example if you want to collect the entire Elder Scrolls series.

Setting: Cyrodil, (Imperial Providence.)
Background: The Emperor, and His Bloodline, are under the Attack of a cult belonging a Deadric Lord, Mehrunes Dagon, and a Human Leading it. The Player is tasked with both finding and protecting the last heir, and ultimatly stopping said lord,
(Non DLC).
Type:Old School AD&Dish Fantasy.Sandbox,Dungeon Crawler
World Size:Not as big as Skyrim. but it does make up for it other ways.

Pros - Make Your Own Character, Abusable Level Cap,,Create A Class,complete with Sign, Perks are giving with most skills. Adjustable Difficulty. VERY Low System Requirements, alot of the useless skillsets have been dismissed from its predeccesors, Morrowind and Daggerfall, and Simplefiled to a degree, although a few arguably still exist, Still somewhat moddable,but bear in mind its still old, and some mods made no longer be updated, multiple questlines,guilds to persue,land to own, sidequests, Dungeons Crawling, (For Some) Level,Item,Dungeon,Enemy Scaling),Fame/Karma/Imfamy Systems in play. ,some puzzles with guilds, but can be looked up wikis if problems gave, and everything, resets in 3 Days,Interior, Exterior,Dungeons,shops,it works well here. Gold on shopkeepers Dosent Run out, but there is a max on them,Dynamic World, very few radiant quests,still a companion system to a degree.
 
Mixed: (Unmodded) Graphical Errors, Stat raises under vanilla can prove to be a pain at times,For Some, Older Graphics, Older Mods, For Some,Scaling, some quests require Fame, or Infamy, Some Minigames may be a little offsetting at first to some. ,for newer players in the series (IE Skyrim), the durability and repair system might be a bit awarkward. (For some) the combat system a bit dated. (But can also, be modded.) 

Cons - Omnipocent Guards, Unmodded parts can cause some problems, usually not enough however to break the main, undlced quest,Scaling again for some,some bugs...

usually most problems can be fixed with a console. if you also need it there is also an unnoficial patch.

Price For Content Verdict, Very High.

The game is the fourth installment in the Elder Scrolls series and takes place in the fictional province of Cyrodiil.

Oblivion features an open world where players can freely explore the province of Cyrodiil, completing various quests and engaging in combat with enemies. The game's main story revolves around the player character, who must close the Oblivion Gates that have opened up around the province and prevent the demon-like creatures known as Daedra from invading.

One of the strengths of Oblivion is its depth and complexity. The game features a wide range of skills and abilities that can be developed over time, allowing players to customize their characters in a variety of ways. The game's quests are also varied and engaging, with a mix of main story missions and side quests that offer plenty of content for players to explore.

The game's graphics, while somewhat dated by modern standards, were impressive for their time and still hold up reasonably well today. The game's soundtrack is also excellent, with a mix of ambient and orchestral music that helps to set the tone for the game's various locations and encounters.

However, there are some downsides to Oblivion. The game's AI can be somewhat wonky at times, with NPCs sometimes behaving in odd or unrealistic ways. The combat system can also feel clunky, particularly for players who are used to more modern action RPGs.

Overall, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is a classic of the genre that is still worth playing today. Its depth, variety, and immersive world make it a game that can keep players engaged for hours on end. While it may not be perfect, it is a game that any fan of action RPGs should definitely check out.",1678587705,1678587705,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Although I only have 26 hours I feel I have learned so much about the Lore and i'm yet to pick up a book. NPC'S have random conversations with one another which makes them feel more alive (Regardless of the fact that their conversations are sour and robotic).

And In my opinion it is The best game of the decade it was released in. (I have tried playing morrowind but I am waiting for Skywind to really try it)

I like many people played this game on a different platform years ago. And Rest assured the real Time I have spent playing this game is in the upper 100s if not low thousands.

It is not Skyrim by any means, but it IS worth playing through at least once thoroughly.

I will start off with the Cons then go into the Pros

Cons(IE things that can be fixed Easily with mods... Except the main story)
-Combat is a grind. If you play this on Vanilla I would not play above normal as it turns combat into a Complete Grind, Both Time wise, as well as Equipment Wise.
-Equipment Durabilty Is absolute trash. Do not get me wrong you can deal with it, but Man is it an annoyance.
-Main story Kind of Sucks.
---I literally avoid starting it in every subsequent play through, as it adds in gates. Which suck hardcore after the first few. Heck I have only ever finished it once, and Man... Bleh, Lame.
-Leveling your character actually turns out to be a Bad idea ""Shrugs"" and can actually make the game Unplayable if done poorly.
-NPC/Player models are... Playdoughy Though there is fun to be had here :)
-Some glitches/Bugs
-Dynamic/Leveled World Enemies(Why the poopershnigel am I leveling up if I get no reward from it?)
-Nirnroots

Pros
-Oh my goodness The world is/Can be Beautiful. My first game I was traveling at night and stopped on a bridge near the mountains to look out through the trees and saw the Imperial city sitting under the stary night with Moons hovering over it.   10/10 Was amazing. The Scenery is absolutely wonderful elsewhere and I think it is better in this regard to anything in Skyrim.
-Missions are fairly diverse Some story lines are repetitive.
-I enjoy dungeon Delving and This game offers a lot of it. (Some people hate the Dungeon designs but I think they are great)
-Moddable to death.
-This game is Art.
-Is really cheap when On sale for Possibly 100s of hours of gameplay.

Side notes. I do recommend some mods. Here are things to Make better. 
***TBH I would change these even before playing through a vanilla run.***
***Some mods require third party Mod Loaders, It can be a hassle but I have never personally had a problem with any of them.***
-Find one that changes the level up system to suite your taste. I have seen some ""Fallout"" Style ones, some that Changes it to Passive level ups with attributes auto given. There are plenty of options.
-Find one that Makes enemies' levels Static. Sure it stops you from exploring some areas early on. But Killing an Archlich at level one with ease only to run in fear of A Rat at level 50 is just stupid.
-Find one that Changes enemies to be less Damage Spongey. There are plenty of mods to choose from. (This also fixes Equipment Degradation to a degree)
***End of These are Must Mod Changes In Tony's(My) opinion***
-Get a mod that Displays Actual HP of enemies. The base *HP bar* on enemies is Just annoying and not really helpful.
-I always found the User Interface(UI) to be alright as I used a controller, but if you play with mouse and Keyboard people love to be vitriolic about the base UI so Maybe if you want to... find a UI Mod. But to be honest they have always been more trouble than they were worth in my opinion.

-I have never once found an NPC makeover mod that escaped the Curse of the Dough. Explore at your own peril.
-All of the ""New lands"" Mods I have tried have uhh... Been really bad. But I suppose that is part of their charm?

Tips.
-Always Keep Multiple saves of the same run. IE Never save over your previous save without having a few hours of backup saves. This sucks as I Really hate having a bunch of save files, BUT it is REALLY worth it trust me.
-If you screw up in a guild and have to do their ""Filthy long Fetch Quests"" Just reload a save as they are just annoying mass fetch quests that offer nothing of value.
-If you want an easier game Make use of Spell Making for Skills. IE Armorer +100 for 1 second is long enough to repair EVERYTHING EVER if it is in your inventory.

The end. 

                                                                                                 Sincerely
                                                                    Your Loving Supreme Overlord and Emperor Tony

I remember playing Oblivion when it came out. I was a kid. I enjoyed every bit of it. 
A few days ago I found an old PC thrown away next to the big trashcans in the street. I picked it up, only to find a MB, Core Duo E6750 and a GeForce 8600GTS inside plus 2 gigs of RAM. Slipped my old SSD in, installed Windows and decided to give some old game a try, to check if everything works and if anything would run on a modern OS in 2023. As you can see, I've played 15 hours since then. :D

The dreadful heavy music that comes up when you're facing a boss is just amazing. 
3. The storyline is really in-depth and well done. The endless side quests that get you experience and materials.
4. The leveling up system is the best. One thing I would take away from this game is how you level as a player. Want to improve your sneak and thievery? You have to use those specific skills.

But its stil booring after some time, story is not that good becouse of no cut scenes which in my opinion is most important for story. At least that end was good.

But cyrodil looks great and that graphics are awsome.

The rpg aspects are good, but the game has aged quite poorly. NPC’s sometimes use 5 different voice actors in one character, for example, giving gold to a beggar and asking for rumors to the same beggar will sometimes have a completely different voice. This is quite immersion breaking. I know that Skyrim has a lot of the same voice actors, but it doesn’t have the issue of one specific character having a trillion voice actors.

The game is a bit glitchy, and was the first roots planted in the game industry for MTX (horse armor dlc).

In this game, you aren’t really the main hero, Martin is. You just help him fulfill his challenge of defeating the main villain. You’re essentially a playable side character in the main storyline.

HOWEVER, for some positives, while it is true that you’re essentially the side character to Martin’s journey, the story is still fairly fun to play through. The quests are fun, the guilds are cool, the main complaint I have is that the dungeons are repetitive, HOWEVER, every elder scrolls game has that, so I won’t hold it against Oblivion.

Overall, I feel like in 2006, this was a masterpiece. But to 2023 standards, especially compared to Skyrim, my personal favorite TES game, it doesn’t match up well, while Skyrim has aged perfectly in my opinion. I’ve been playing continuously for ten years, while for oblivion, I just don’t feel that way that I do for Skyrim and Morrowind. Not a bad game, just not the best either.

While many consider Morrowind to be the pinnacle of the Elder Scrolls series (and I would agree that it’s an excellent game), Oblivion, for me, achieved that sweet-spot trade-off between player quality-of-life and narrative complexity. 

Mechanically speaking, Oblivion polished the template laid down by Morrowind and made it an outstanding continuation of the Elder Scrolls franchise, introducing fast travel, a new map system, improved quest logs, more advanced dialogue trees, voice acting, and a more vibrant colour palette. Morrowind undoubtedly had a more sophisticated narrative, but the clunkiness of the game itself made it so much harder to get into, particularly as I came to it in retrospect. 
Likewise, Skyrim (Oblivion’s successor) is a thrill to play, but I feel some of that RPG quality was lost in the gap as the studio made the leap to mainstream popularity and accessibility. Oblivion, however, sits directly in the middle, neither as mainstream as Skyrim or as niche as Morrowind – which is perhaps why it’s often overlooked in favour of either of those two. 

Many of the games I’ve recommended on Steam have a common quality – when I think back, I immediately picture particular scenes from them whenever their names are mentioned. Whether it’s Final Fantasy’s Midgar, The Silent Cartographer of Halo, or even Ostrheinsburg Castle in Soulcalibur, for me the environment and the ‘feel’ of the game is often the important part. Very few action scenes or even character moments have lodged in memory in that same way. Oblivion is a game replete with these seminal moments. 

This isn’t to wax lyrical about a game with flaws, of course. Oblivion suffers from the Bethesda problem of “quantity over quality” in many regards, particularly in the case of the titular Oblivion Gates, which are style over substance and rapidly become the most tedious part of the game – which is a real shame. But the game itself is full of memorable scenes and stories. I’ll never forget cresting a hill in the middle of the verdant countryside, only for the sky to turn crimson as a foreboding Oblivion gate comes into view; or the first step into the Shivering Isles, where Haskill’s grey room disintegrates in a shower of butterflies to open out onto a vast, primordial landscape; the moment in the Fighter’s Guild questline when you go back to the sleepy town of Water’s Edge and discover what really happened there; the treasure-hunt come murder-mystery that is ‘Whodunit?’ (and for that matter all the rest of the Dark Brotherhood quests); the hauntingly-memorable Daedric Prince quests. Too much about this game is great to justify spoiling it with the bad parts – and if that’s inconsistent, I don’t mind.",1676040726,1676040726,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Oblivion may feel like a cracked out fever dream sometimes but that's why I love the game. Although it crashes from time to time I've never really lost much progress and most of the time when I do its easy to make up. I 100% recommend the game to anyone, fans of The Elder Scrolls or not. Its such a wonderful game to just wander through despite the old graphics the settings are still beautiful, and the soundtrack only amplifies the experience whether its the serene beauty of a forest or the eerie air of a decrepit ruin to music to amplify the feeling of being locked in an epic battle. I love all the skills you can level to build a unique experience for the different builds one may try or the different characters you may make for the world of the game. From heavy hitter to the stealthy assassin or a frail but powerful mage and everything in between. There's plenty of side quests and places to explore alongside the DLC if you don't care much for the Main Quest or want something else to do. 

Again, maybe I'm biased by my nostalgia in my love for this game but I love it nonetheless.

Very few of them ever solely send you off to clear dungeons- you're going to be mostly travelling, sleuthing and convincing.

Tries a few new things for the time: mechanicalizes speech into a minigame like lockpicking (but they didn't tutorialize it so people complain about it without knowing how it works), gives characters meaningful routines that affect or can be affected by the player.

There are multiple factions to join and things to pursue, none of which feel like a participation award. You can build an interesting character, you're not forced to become stealth archer.

There are many unique items and as well as easter eggs in the game that are fun to find. And all the DLC was good as well.

Like the other games in this franchise Oblivion has some flaws and faults mostly just the voice acting and dungeon designs feeling copy pasted. A man can only loot so many ayleid ruins and decrepit fortresses full of claymation looking models so many times. 
Oblivion still holds onto the skill system from earlier titles while managing to not be too much to take in for newer players. It removed the ""RNG"" combat that Morrowind was notorious for and stripped down the attacks to your basic light attacks and directional power attacks, a stark contrast to Morrowinds diverse weapon attacks.
Oblivion has allot of interesting and thoughtfully constructed quests that take you to a lot of interesting places, I think oblivion has some of the best and most memorable quests and characters in the franchise. It's easy to get stuck on how doughy and plastic everything looks but make no mistake.
Under the over saturated color palette and doughy characters, medicore and sometimes down right awful voice acting, D tier dungeons and the worst leveling system in the franchise there is allot of fun and enjoyment to be had with this game.",1675190550,1675190550,True,34,0,0.770069479942321777,0,True,False,False

To remedy this, the Flame Atronach casts a spell on me making me resistant to fire. Keep in mind, resistant is not the same as immune. I still take damage. It is either 1 point or 0 points of damage each second I am having sex with her. Just because a particular second caused 0 points of damage, does not mean that I did not feel anything, It just means that I took no damage. I am not going to rush through having sex with this Flame Atronach, I make sure I pleasure anything I have sex with. I'd rather take damage than not pleasure the Flame Atronach.

The Flame Atronach and I go to the Planes of Oblivion to have sex. It is ALWAYS sexier to have sex in their natural habitat rather than a human's natural habitat.

Before we went into the Planes of Oblivion, the Flame Atronach let all the Daedra know that we are just here for sex. The Daedra will not attack us because they know I am here at the Planes of Oblivion on sexual business. This includes the Dremora.

From game to game there isn't much difference but over the span of the games I've played (Elder Scrolls 2 Daggerfall to 5 Skyrim) ... there's quite a bit different. I'm sure everybody has their own list but (with mods and everything considered) I think Oblivion is the best. With Daggerfall Unity I'd have to say that's my second favorite. I really like Morrowind but somehow missed out on it when it was out so for me I have a hard time getting use to the jankyness of it sometimes and Skyrim always feels like a chore to play. Like it's laborious.

Over Skyrim, Oblivion has a better story line, better character progression (you aren't a dragon god from the beginning of the game for example), slightly better combat, MUCH MUCH better cities (I mean Skyrim doesn't even feel like an Elders Scrolls game when it comes to the settlements), better terrain overall (Not everything is at the top of its own individual mountain), and I've never had the main campaign irrevocably fall into a dead end. 

The graphics aren't as great but can be greatly improved upon with mods and I'll always hate how an NPC will be shouting in anger one sentence only to return to the default smile pose then get super serious the next.

If you know Skyrim, you should have played this before.
If you know Morrowind, this came after that.
If you're born after the year 2000, Elder Scrolls Online is far beyond this. 
The unity of these worlds, is a wow, especially because of how big, and unique Skyrim and Oblivion were;

Emperor Tiberius with a large crystal on his chest, had conquested into the Oblivion planes, which wages an eternal war with humanity.

Running over mountains
Hide & Seek from enemies/frenemies
Modding

Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion with its expansions was one of the first games I got for the Xbox 360 and I put at least 100+ hours on that copy of the game. This game is a joy to play with a wonderful amount of main quests, secondary quests, and simple side quests to keep a player busy. 

The game world itself is a wonderful balance between breath and depth. You feel that locations on the map are just far enough apart to give the sense of distance without it being tedious to move around. While you start off with the main cities on the map, it is up to you to find everything else by exploring the world. Combat was amazing when the game was first released and is still very respectable at this time. The replay value is also very high with the mix of Races/Classes/Birthsigns giving you very different play-through each time.    
 
Now, there are a few things any RPG game lover will need to consider before buying this game. The first is that this game came out in 2006. That means that the graphics, while very good for there time and still rather nice, are dated compared to other games out there. Elder Scrolls V Skyrim being a prime example. There is also the fact that there have been changes in the Elder Scroll series between the various editions. If you have first played Elder Scrolls V you might find some of these shifts noticeable at first. 

None of the changes mean that Elder Scrolls IV is ""worse"" or ""better"" than its sequel or other more modern RPG games available. They instead reflect a difference in both design and style that has changed throughout the years. A prime example of this is the leveling system Elder Scrolls IV uses which is tied to 7 ""major"" skills and you level up as you improve these skills. Furthermore, you need to rest to level up once you meet the requirements. This is actually rather useful because it allows you to work the ""minor"" skills so that all your stats level up higher than if you automatically leveled up. 

If you are a RPG game lover you will want to add this game to your collection. You may also want to consider this game if you are interested in seeing if the RPG style game is right for you. Even without a sale you get dozens of hours of enjoyable game play at a very good deal. The relatively minimal hardware requirements compared to modern games in this style is also good for someone looking for a fun game without being a big gamer or having a gaming computer.",1673234966,1673234966,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Alongside the console was 1-3 games, one being The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. I had never heard of this game, but I booted it up to appease the person who gifted this to me, and low and behold… it was like the clouds parted and the warm light of the RPG Gods smiled upon me that day.

All dramatics aside, this game has been quite legitimately life changing for me, personally. It has shaped the way I tell stories, it has changed the way I approach RPGs and TTRPGs. This game introduced me to dynamic characters, shocking plot twists, and an immersive lore-rich world that is unlike any other. I know that everyone talks about Skyrim being a work of art, but you are truly missing out on some of the best storytelling of your life here, buddy. Nearly every quest is absolutely enthralling. The Dark Brotherhood quest line will have your jaw on the floor. You thought the Theives Guild in Skyrim was wild, buckle up, buttercup.

I really can not recommend this game enough. You have to put your grown up pants on and suffer with some crummy graphics, but it’s worth it. I would almost advise against modding this for your first play through, because honestly some of the bugs and absurd character face designs are just too funny to miss out on. The good is GREAT and the bad is funny. Glitching through the floorboards is endearing in most instances, and it’s really a small price to pay for how amazing this game is.

The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is the game that set the template for modern Bethesda games (both the Elder Scrolls and Fallout series), and (because the formula was so successful) modern open world games in general.  Like any modern open world game, you always have access to an in-game map with quest markers shown clearly all over the place; you will never get lost.

In some games, this doesn't work well and you feel like you're just following the arrow from one objective to the next.  Oblivion does the same thing, but the quests are varied and interesting enough that it somehow works.  It helps that there are actually very few of the typical ""collect five rat tails"" kind of quests you find in lesser games.

Oblivion has a very satisfying main quest, but it's also very enjoyable to just roam around exploring and setting your own goals.  As you wander around town, you'll see and hear NPCs having conversations with one another; listening to these can sometimes even clue you in to optional quests.  It's a very cool touch and makes the world feel a bit more believable, even if the conversations end up becoming complete ridiculous the longer you listen to them (they are not scripted, but somewhat random).
[hr][/hr]
Oblivion is somewhat infamous for its level scaling mechanic.  In short, enemies and loot are all scaled to your character level only.  However, you skills only advance though use, and so this can place you into a difficult situation where your level is high but your important skills are weak; meanwhile, all the monsters in the game have scaled up your high level.  There are several ways around this, but here's what I recommend:

Create a custom class and tag the skills you WON'T use as your major skills.  Your character only gains experience toward leveling up when he uses a major skill, so you can stay at a low level while your useful skills continue to improve.  I used this strategy and ended up completing the game at level 2, and the scaling mechanic was never a problem.
[hr][/hr]
Although I was able to complete the main quest (and lots of other content) in only 40 hours, I really only scratched the surface of what this game offers, Oblivion is truly a game you could play for hundreds of hours.  Highly recommended!

Oblivion is an open-world role-playing game developed by Bethesda Game Studios and released in 2006. I decided to play Oblivion because I had heard good things about it and I'm a fan of Bethesda's other games, such as Skyrim and Fallout.

[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]
Oblivion's gameplay involves exploring a vast, detailed world, completing quests and objectives, and leveling up your character's skills and abilities. The controls are generally intuitive and responsive, although there were a few times when I had trouble using the mouse to look around. One unique feature of Oblivion is the ability to create your own spells and enchant your own weapons, which adds an extra layer of customization to the gameplay. During my time playing, I didn't encounter any major bugs or glitches, which is always a plus.

[h1]Story:[/h1]
The story of Oblivion revolves around the player character being chosen as the ""Champion of Cyrodiil"" to close the gates of Oblivion and stop the invasion of the Daedra. The main story is fairly straightforward, but there are also numerous side quests and activities to keep you occupied. The characters in the game are well-developed and have their own motivations and personalities. The pacing of the story is generally well-done, although there were a few times when it dragged on a bit too long.

[h1]Graphics and Sound:[/h1]
Oblivion's graphics are definitely showing their age at this point, but they still hold up well considering the game is over 15 years old. The landscapes and environments are beautiful and detailed, and the character models and animations are solid. The frame rate was generally smooth, although there were a few instances of minor stuttering. The sound design in Oblivion is also excellent, with a great soundtrack and memorable voice acting.

[h1]Replay Value:[/h1]
Oblivion has a lot of replay value due to the sheer amount of content it offers. There are multiple endings depending on the choices you make throughout the game, and there are also numerous side quests and activities to keep you busy. Additionally, there are multiple difficulty levels to choose from, so you can tailor the game's challenge to your liking.

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]
Overall, I really enjoyed my time with Oblivion. The gameplay is solid, the story is engaging, and the graphics and sound hold up well despite the game's age. While it does have a few minor flaws, it's still an excellent RPG and I would definitely recommend it to others.",1664902325,1672335853,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First off, the graphics in Oblivion are absolutely stunning. The environments and characters are richly detailed and really bring the world to life. The gameplay is smooth and immersive, and there's just so much to do and explore.

But what really sets Oblivion apart is the character customization. You can create your own character and choose from a wide variety of races, including humans, elves, and even Khajiit (cat people). And let me tell you, those Khajiit females are seriously hot.

But it's not just about the eye candy - Oblivion is a true test of skill and determination. It'll push you to your limits and then some. But if you've got what it takes, if you're the kind of gamer who doesn't flinch in the face of danger, then this is the game for you.

So Sharks, I'm asking for a $500,000 investment in exchange for a 10% stake in the company. With your help, we can take Oblivion to the next level and make it the biggest role-playing game on the market. Thank you.",1672297960,1672297960,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But it's not. Not by a long shot. Why?
Because this PC port ala Bethesda is a broken mess of a game riddled with numerous game breaking bugs. Now, don't get me wrong, the original Xbox 360 title HAD game crashing and what not, but this is a little different. We're talking even WHEN I mod the ever loving soul out of this game just to prevent technical issues (Which depending on what random circumstances you have going on, you won't even be able to play this game on PC WITHOUT mods due to compatibility issues), this game still never fails to hit me with an absolutely game busting bug somewhere along its run.

Years ago it was a glitch I happened to get that completely corrupted my game file and would cause it to become terminal; literally crashing ANY time I entered a Save trigger. Even when I edited the files to that I could only manually save, Manual Saves would trigger this crash too. So that file that I had invested 40 hours into already was basically gone.
What happened after that?
Well, my next two saves from last year and now this year were plagued by a time based bug that caused the game to crash, for whatever reason, about 3 minutes after startup without fail. Why? I couldn't tell you, it's Bethesda coding.

This game was always running on duct tape and crafting glue and its port to PC has never failed to do anything but leave an utterly sour taste in my mouth. I WANT to play this game again and get sunk into it like I once did, but I can't. The game LITERALLY won't let me.

So here's a quick story on why I like the game, There I am minding my own business fighting a few gobos in a fort when one goblin warlord just wouldn't die! I kept smacking him around but to no avail he just was too angry to die, not only that but he decided that I would be the focus of his rage, no matter where I went he somehow managed to find me and attack me and any creature near by, Finally I was able to slay this angry being with console commands but alas I missed him and so did the group of friends listening in on this chaos. We even named him, he would be known from that point on as chuckles. I reloaded my save found him again and with the help of some handy mods I was able to keep his rage at bay but he may have become friends with me although all other creatures were met with his rage. Chuckles can not be stopped by mortal men, nor the gods and they quake before this goblin warlords might.

I spent countless hours on the Xbox 360 version of this game, and I still have yet to finish the main story line. Getting lost in the plains of Oblivion, as well as the province of Cyrodil, is ridiculously easy to do. Choose a direction, and walk that way until you find one of the many Ayelid ruins, caves, forts, castles, or settlements. This game is just plain fun.

The graphics are old by today's standards, but I enjoy retro gaming. For me, I like it. The bloom on the Xbox 360 was something you could not turn off, but alas! We can in the PC version! Huzzah! I can tell you that running this game on anything above a zotac zbox en970 will result in a completely maxed out experience. There is one huge drawback with this game, and that is the UI was designed for console first. That can be fixed by installing a mod.
Oh, btw, MASSIVE modding support over on the Nexus. Check that out, if you want.

The controls are useable, and mostly rebindable. However, there are several hidden controls with nothing to refer to them other than in the opening tutorial. (Hold shift and left click to drop an item in menu? Who tf is going to remember that after not playing the game for a few weeks...why can't it be right click to drop, or press q?)

The sound design is both great, and very bad at the same time. The balancing of all the effects is truly awful, and can lead to hearing (or missing) ques to search, attack, or run. The sound effects are more than adequate, as well as the music and voice acting. HOWEVER, all of the above has a very small quantity. There are very few voice actors, the musical score is very small, and most of the sound effects are simply related to the material type without variation. For exaple, a steel sword and a daedric sword have the same sound effect when used, or dropped. That carries across all the items.

This version comes with all of the DLC, including the controversial Horse Armor. seriously, google some gaming news articles related to Horse Armor DLC. After that, come back to Steam, and then sigh, depressed knowing the people who wrote the anti-Horse DLC articles predicted the future.

I won't tell you this game is the greatest RPG you can play. It isn't. It has the normal amount of Bethesda bugs that follow it. Which doesn't make it a bad game. 

I am going to assume that you all ready know something about The Elder Scrolls since you're here. (You've most likely played Skyrim and not the others.) 

This is somewhat very different from Skyrim. I don't mean that for the worst either. I'm sure you could ask many others that have followed TES and they would tell you that Bethesda actually tends to remove features from previous games. So, don't expect to have a game that feels exactly like Skyrim. 

I'd say this is my second to almost a tie for favorite in The Elder Scrolls Series. It feels closer to Morrowind than it does Skyrim. To me..it feels like Morrowind upgraded, changed and had a few things taken away.

It's a great game. If you're willing to deal with it's age and the many bugs that are in it. 

If you only like Skyrim for the ""Modern"" feel. I use that loosely as Skyrim does have some age to it now. I'd say this is a no. 

If you enjoy older games or just really enjoy The Elder Scrolls. I'd say it's a yes. 

You really have to take this game for what it is. It's an early seventh generation game, that's also made by Bethesda. Which I'm not trying to insult them, I enjoy almost all of their games. But, even fans of them have grown to know what to expect.

It's a great game. I hold this title very dear. I have countless amounts of memories with it. So, while I'm not trying to write a review that may seem like I'm pushing you to purchase this title. This truly is more than a game to me. It's a part of my past that is very meaningful to me.",1671972146,1671972146,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

4. Worst level scaling-the damage sponge problem- (which can be fixed with mods such as ""deadly reflex"")

7. Endless hours of gameplay after the main quest and faction quests are finished, if you're into dungeon crawling

I have played 200+ hours in 2019 (With a bunch of mods installed) and still feel there is so much more to do and get lost in the world of Cyrodil.
I always play as an Archer - A Wood Elf in the Elder Scrolls series games or i play as a High Elf as a Pure Mage.  I dont like mindless button mashing of sword fighting. An Archer or a Mage is where its at!
I have finished the following
 - Basic quests given in cities
 - Mages Guild All Quests (You do this first, as you get access to enchantment and spell making)
 - Thieves Guild All Quests (You do this as they are great fun and you get the Cowl of Nocturnal - which is very useful to zip across Cyrodil and the 120 ft Detect Life enchantment)
 
Once i did these, i started the Main Quest and finished it.

200+ hours completed and I still have not completed  
- The highly rated Dark Brotherhood Quests 
- The average Fighter Guild Quests
- The super fun Daedric Quests
- The Arena Quests (which i doubt i would do!)
- The Shivering Isles
- The Knights expansion

So Let me update this after i finish the rest!  See you guys in 2023!

Oblivion really is the midway point between Morrowind and Skyrim. It maintains the RPG mechanics from Morrowind but brings it into a new HD age with more responsive combat and physics like Skyrim. Unfortunately, it's weaker than both, featuring none of the mystic and lack of handholding of Morrowind, or the polish and style of Skyrim.

Oblivion is a game that succeeds due to its freedom and despite its endless faults. Still, I wouldn't recommend this unless you've already played Morrowind and Skyrim and really want more. It's much too heavily flawed.

[b]The Great[/b]
++Side quests are way more memorable than Skyrim's.
++So much to do and explore. There's an overwhelming amount of content on offer here.

[b]The Good[/b]
+Looks beautiful for 2006. It's just the character models and animations that let it down.
+Cyrodiil is a wildly different landscape to Skyrim and Morrowind, which makes Oblivion feel distinct.
+Weapons actually hit your opponent when you see them physically hit, as they should (unlike Morrowind).
+Okay RPG mechanics. Too much to go into depth here.
+The DLC's solid.

[b]Mild Issues/Things to Note[/b]
-+No Xbox controller support. Not entirely unusual for 2006 despite the game's release on the Xbox 360, but still annoying. Northern UI fixes this.
+-The Elder Scrolls beyond Morrowind is generic fantasy through and through. Oblivion is the worst of the 3D era games in this regard.
+-Performance is questionable for a game from 2006.
-+Being as they're one of the only ways of healing, and avoiding damage is nearly impossible, I think healing potions are too expensive and uncommon.
+-Enemy health bars do a poor job of actually indicating enemy health.
-+Heresy to say, but... the soundtrack's only okay. I much prefer Morrowind and Skyrim's in all honesty.
+-Sound design is below average.
-+The AI's bad.
+-The main quest is okay.

[b]The Bad[/b]
-Voice acting is just odd. The number of voice actors is tiny and everyone over acts... or sleeps through their lines. They also sound like they're reading the script for the first time as they act. Often times the voices change in different sentences with the same character. Also, why do the beggars have english accents when no one else in the game does? Lastly, there's a single voice actor for all Argonian males, and another actor for all Argonian females... what a joke.
-The lock-picking mini-game blows.
-The speech mini-game is ridiculous.
-This game has no memorable characters.
-The map sucks. Why is it so zoomed in and slow to scroll?
-Some locations are able to be fast travelled to immediately and I'm not sure why. Others require you to physically visit them first even if marked on your map. This makes it hard to explore every part of the map as you're not sure where you have and haven't already been. There's also no indication of what you've already explored and haven't.
-Ghosts are a pain. Why have an enemy that only one class type can destroy (until later stages)? There's no other obvious barrier like this in the game.
-The difficulty slider is complete bullshit. Most players are going to struggle at some point on the medium default difficulty, let alone the lower ends of the slider that turn even rats into absolute damage sponges.
-Enemies will chase you to the end of the earth.
-FOV is tiny by default and requires a mod to change. Console commands won't do the trick here.
-You can't be exclusively a blades man or exclusively a marksman, or you're going to find yourself in positions where you stand no chance. You need to be a combination of things.
-Story is forgettable.
-AI sucks.
-Oblivion portals aren't fun.

[b]The Terrible[/b]
--The world scales around you which is lame. I much prefer visiting areas and finding out I'm in over my head and need to come back when my character is stronger rather than have everything always be a threat whether I'm a peasant or a God. It also turned parts of the main quest into an absolute chore. I reached a roadblock where I was being killed by a single opponent because none of my weapons did any notable damage and hers killed me in 5 hits. This is with me dumping all my skill points into blades and bows. And there were 4 more of her enemy types around the corner. Atrocious difficulty balancing.
--Dungeons have two themes and differ very slightly between each other. They're not fun to explore and they're extremely repetitive. Even the loot is almost always completely useless. They're also quite non-linear but in a bad way, making them slightly confusing to explore.
--Combat is horrible. Archery results in your flinging literally dozens of arrows into an opponent B-lining towards you. Melee results in you being staggered repeatedly and blocking every once in a while, while mindlessly slashing away. There's very little skill or tactics involved in either. I haven't tried magic, but it looks similar. Difficulty spikes can be huge for little discernible reason, healing methods do little and are uncommon, the AI sucks, blocking isn't overly helpful, power attacks take too long to be useful and there's next to no strategy involved in combat.

While the game is dated, this only helps the game achieve a unique art style, reminiscent to watercolor. The dated graphics also make the dungeons feel creepy as hell. 
The mechanics of the game are very different from newer games but they feel as if there was a lot of thought put into them, especially the spell system. 
My favorite part of the game has to be the side-quests though, each one feels completely different from the next. There's a quest where you literally go into a painting and fight trolls made of paint!

The story of the main quest is very immersive and fun to play through. The guild's quest lines are mostly good with some of them being among the best I ever played. The shivering isles DLC took some time of me to get into it because it felt so weird I couldn't understand it but as I progressed through it, it started making more sense and I realised that it always did. Wonderful DLC really.

The combat system is really nice and I particularly enjoyed magic as the game gives me total freedom to craft spells and with a bit of imagination you can really hack the game with your custom spells.

Graphics wise, the graphics of the characters has definitely aged, actually they looked bad even for the time but other than that I believe this game's visuals are still very decent.

Sound is also nice. The OSTs are lovable and the voice acting can be weird sometimes but that has a nice thing to it.

There are some issues of course. Some quests are annoying, some are way too easy and frankly disappointing (looking at you mannimarco), mounts are a complete joke, the leveling system is a bit complex imo and again everyone looks ugly.

Many will also mention the bugs. True you will find some but I believe Oblivion is one of the few games which are broken to perfection. The bugs do add something nice to it particularly the dialogues.

Overall, with all its issues, I think this game is a masterpiece that is totally worth playing even today.

You can find stories in every nook and cranny of the map. You can become anything. The quests are deeper than ""fetch this and I'll pay you."" Characters you meet will tell interesting stories, say more than a few stock lines. 

The game is also hilarious. The shock of seeing a grinning guard spontaneously running off a bridge into the Oblivion fires was made funnier by the fact that the quest he was featured in was so serious that I felt emotionally invested. Also the really dumb minigame where you charm someone. There's so much potential to cheese everything in the game, but it's so silly that it doesn't even detract from the rich and beautiful experience, it just adds comedy. And this game came out in 2006. Half of the stock lines have already been turned into memes by now.

It's also good that the game doesn't take itself too seriously either. You get an even split between funny and dramatic. Sometimes even a funny quest can hit you in the feels, like Mazoga's. 

As of the time of writing this, I have yet to complete the main quest. Yes I modded Oblivion a bit (to make the faces look less stupid and for bugfixes), but I went in pretty much vanilla and played for 80 hours. Besides from the Mages Guild, I have completed no major questline. There is just so much to see and do. Plus, I hear Shivering Isles essentially adds a whole second game to play. 

CONS: It's clunky. You're not playing this game for cool fighting mechanics or anything, though fights still feel fun because you have to apply some old-school RPG tactics to your combat. Also some may get turned off by the graphics, but those are easily tweaked via mods. 

TIPS: Leveling is broken. Feel free to move the difficulty slider around to the most fun level to play. No one's giving you medals for doing the hardest difficulty, where your hits do only 1/6th damage and rats can oneshot you. Invest in acrobatics, and you can pretty much roll away from any enemy. Save often, never trust the autosave. And becoming a vampire is actually really useful and good for combat, unless you hate never being in the sun.

VERDICT: Must-play. A classic that stands the test of time.",1669916174,1669916174,True,0,1,0,1,True,False,False

Oblivion and Skyrim are my white whale. My sisyphean tasks doomed to never be completed. I've never actually finished Oblivion (or Skyrim, for the same reasons). Each time I've tried to start I've instead found myself modding it for hours on end over the course of several days before eventually getting distracted by something else and I ""forget"" about it. I once spent two weeks modding the non-Steam version of Oblivion back in 2008. I still remember buying all the original DLCs from the official Bethesda site, including the infamous horse armor DLC, and then spending hours upon hours combing through the mod collections on Nexusmods to find all the best mods, from unofficial patches, to UI improvements, to graphics mods, to whole new content packs with their own dungeons or questlines. I still have all of those original files saved on my NAS, totalling 16GB, neatly organized by category, all these years later.

If you enjoy tinkering with mods, play-testing each one after install, troubleshooting mod compatibility issues, using/learning archaic and obscure third-party mod managers (BOSS, OBSE, OBMM, Wrye BASH, TES4Edit, etc.), optimizing the load order of each mod, learning new scripting languages, and generally not getting anything done because you waste all your time on modding a game instead of actually playing it, then Oblivion (or Skyrim) is the game for you.

10/10 - would start to play again and never finish, every time. This is my fate.

i surprisingly really enjoyed Morrowind for its depth & Skyrim for its replayability, so i started the 4th instalment wondering what it could offer me when the other main ones were both so outstanding in their own ways.

i think TESIV: Oblivion is my favorite Elder Scrolls game. the intro/tutorial integrated most gameplay elements smoothly, the class/skill/stat customizations were the sweet spot between the incredibly detailed system of its predecessor & the very generalized system of its successor, & once you finally set out on your own, you are greeted w/ an unforgettable sight of Cyrodiil. it's such a gorgeous game even now. the storyline stands out as you are not some foretold legend, something that i personally dislike especially in TESV, but you still are a vital part of the story, a hero who make a name for themselves, not a prophecy to fulfill w/ some special ability only available to you. the only complaint i have is that ""cur"" does not ring the same as ""milkdrinker"" in Skyrim / ""nwah"" in Morrowind.

Skyrim is my only direct play experience before Oblivion, and I assume it's the same for a lot of others.

If you LOVED Skyrim and are craving more of that feeling, I can promise you that Oblivion is filled with it. Your Skyrim instincts will come in very handy, and a lot of things will transfer over directly. Other things are quirks to get used to, and I have to encourage people to work through whatever obstacles may come up that prevent you from getting into the game at first -- I almost put it down in frustration trying to get it to work the way I wanted it to, but I'm glad I stuck with it.

Pretty much everything that turned me off at first can be modded around, one of the foremost of which is the leveling mechanic. There is an easy fix to the finicky way this game handles attributes and skillups -- I would recommend looking up something called ""Ultimate Leveling"" on Nexus Mods, and doing some reading on how it works in vanilla versus the options the mod gives you -- you can make it feel a lot more like Skyrim leveling, or even traditional experience point based leveling, if you want to. If Vanilla works for ya', -- go nuts..

I would definitely recommend making sure to get the official and unofficial patches, just like you would expect to do in Skyrim in 2022 -- they're old and buggy games, but apparently I'm not the only one to forgive them those flaws. ;-)

You should also consider Darnified UI, which requires a little bit of reading and setup to get working properly (you'll need the equivalent of Skyrim's Script Extender installed and working first), but once you have it nailed, it improves the interface and HUD drastically -- especially the map, which was a big one for me! I have a very weak sense of direction, in video games and real life. You can expand it so you can see more of it at once.

Side-note: I wish I could pull up a minimap in my brain for reality (would be most helpful), but that's part of why I spend so much time in Tamriel instead.

Final observation -- just like with Skyrim, the NPCs are hilariously stupid, and their AI can be mercilessly exploited. I've found great fun using the ""charm"" spell so far, and enemies can be baited into friendly fire in helpful ways. Bathe in the molten, hot cheese of it all, and enjoy. :-)",1668942059,1668942385,True,0,0,0.47413790225982666,0,True,False,False

Maybe because I was so excited to hear about ""Morrowind's sequel"" (lmao) before trying, but regardless, it became one of my favourite games of all time even though I NEVER played through the main quest, only exploration, guilds and secondary quest. 

With all that out of the way, if you are reading reviews to decide whether to get Oblivion, you probably don't know about it, so to put it simply it's a clunkier Skyrim in a completely different setting, and I personally prefer Cyrodiil with its woods and plains to the frozen north of Skyrim. Combat is pretty bland and you usually just block and mash attack until the opponent ragdolls, but exploration has always been pretty fun, there's always some dungeon to see or some quest to find.

This game is far larger than Skyrim, or at least it feels like it. There are some big empty areas or long treks up mountains that can be a bit tedious.

I remember popping Oblivion into my Xbox 360 and losing myself for days in its bloom drenched neon green forests. Sneaking around homes, my heart beating fast in my chest, taking the priceless loot for my horde. Walking to shrines of the princes and fulfilling their mad bidding. Talking with the people who felt more alive than anything I had ever played before. Getting lost in the quests both rich and complex. How each new dungeon was filled with danger and opportunity. How the crowd of the Arena made my heart soar. Yes, I remember it all. 

It has been over 15 years since I last played Oblivion -- hard to believe for a game that meant so much to me. I was hesitant at first but here I am, just over 7 hours in, and it feels just as good -- just as fresh and new as it once did. I don't think a good game can be anything but good, no matter how much time passes over it. Sure its got jank and some questionable design choices. The vanilla faces are nightmare fuel and the world is a bit one note. But we've had mods for all that for a long time. 

At its core Oblivion was a game that didn't take many risks and yet managed to be revolutionary. While Morrowind's atmosphere and main quest may always be the best in the series, the more I play Oblivion the more I realize that it's strength was its quests and characters. If Skyrim is a game of exploring, Oblivion is a game of immersing. If Morrowind is a game of wonder, Oblivion is a game of nostalgia. I'm so happy to be back. In truth I'm sorry I ever left. But that's enough for now. Chances are you aren't here to decide if you should be buying this game or not, you already know the answer. Instead I imagine, like me, you're here to reminisce.

I don't remember the xbox 360 version having as many game breaking bugs as this version. I´ve only got 13 hours but i´ve already encountered 2 potentially game breaking bugs. 

1.  on the main quest line when you visit a site called miscarcand. After visiting this site i couldn't fast travel or sleep because it said there were always enemies nearby, this bug was supposedly fixed but i still happened in the GOTY version i bought. Luckily someone online had a fix. 
2. Cant get a recommendation from the Bruma mages guild cause of a faulty NPC. 

Overall great game but annoying AF that i have to find fixes online for a game this old.

The story itself is interesting enough where you can get the feel for it, but the Hero of Kvatch is someone who is undefined other then he is the warrior that closes oblivion gates. Thus the role-play and player build up in this game really does matter.

The story, graphics, soundtrack, AI, voices, mechanics, and setting were perfect in my eyes SIXTEEN years ago of me making this review. I never beat it back then, but I did play it, and boy was I blown away back then.

However, how does it stack up now in comparison to modern western RPGs? Well, not the best, but I still like it. And after over 200 hours of exploring, talking to people, and becoming the Champion of Cyrodiil (and Sheogorath...?), I can finally say I've beaten the game. It was an amazing journey. I'm not sure if it's all that nostalgia I've had for this game, but I enjoyed my experience with this game as much as New Vegas, and I considered that to be my favorite western RPG.

Getting this game to even just comply with modern hardware can be insanely annoying too. For my playthrough, I wanted to keep it as original as possible, so I only used 2 mods: Oblivion Script Extender (OBSE) and a custom FOV script to make sure my FOV stays at 110 without the menu becoming so small you need a microscope to navigate it. There are so many more mods you can install to make this game feel a lot more modern and look the part too, but in my opinion that feels like overkill. I don't know if it's just me being a person who's childhood was in the 2000s, but I like how everything played back then, and Oblivion is no exception.

Overall, would this game be worth adding to your library in the year 2022? I'm not sure. On one hand, Skyrim is a lot more accessible for those who don't like installing mods, and Morrowind has quite the charm of an old game. However, this game defined a period of my childhood, and I am insanely biased on this one. At least give it a shot.",1666656861,1666656861,True,2,0,0.497942358255386353,0,True,False,False

S0UL: Anyway, for real though, Oblivion is an amazing game. Allows quite a bit of freedom compared to Skyrim. Fans of RPGs will absolutely love this game and sink 100+ hours into this game. The magic system is fantastic in this game, allowing you to craft your own custom spells with multiple effects as you progress in the game. I will admit, melee combat can be a bit clunky and the dialogue between NPCs while walking through cities can be... bizzare to say the least. But a lot of the shortcomings with Oblivion can be improved or outright fixed with mods. I would definetly reccommend the Unofficial Oblivion Patch as a minimum, along with other good gameplay mods (such as Deadly Reflex) and graphical enhancement mods to modernise the game. The major expansion for this game is the Shivering Isles, allowing players to enter Sheogorath's plane of Oblivion of the same name. This is one of the best Bethesda DLCs ever and anyone will have an amazing time. The game combined with its DLCs, I would rate a 9/10.

TLDR; Buy this game already if you haven't (100% recommend) but remember this game came out in 2008 so some parts will be a little clunky. Nothing that mods can't fix!",1666207584,1666207584,True,2,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

But...I still love it. 

It's been 15 years since Oblivion released, and it's still one of the most immersive games you can play. It puts you in a vast world that is packed full of lore and details, and gives the freedom to do whatever you want. The world is dense, full of towns, cities, and dungeons to explore, and you can pretty much go anywhere and talk to any of the NPCs. It's graphics may be dated, but it still possesses a warm and serene beauty, perfectly balancing the darker and more mysterious stories and quests. While epic in scale, the main story is slightly generic, but the guilds and side quests are some of the most memorable and varied in any game. All this is enhanced by an otherworldly atmosphere, and an unforgettable masterpiece of a soundtrack. The combat kind of sucks though :(

Whether you decide to follow the main story, one of the many side stories, or just explore the world, you're sure to find discoveries around every corner. Oblivion promises to give you an epic adventure, but what makes it so special is that personal discovery of your own adventure. It's a game that makes you feel like a kid again, living another life full of excitement and mysteries, where you can be whoever you wish to be.",1665818127,1665818545,True,44,5,0.754330635070800781,0,True,False,False

[b]Short introduction[/b]

Back in 2006, one of the cult and at the same time one of my favorite RPG games was released. Yeah, it was TES:Oblivion. At one time, I spent almost all my free time in this game, because everything what I needed was in there. Starting from the most full customization of your game character, one of the most filled lore in the game industry, interesting and elaborated quests, and ending with an excellent soundtrack and wonderful graphics for that time (2006). And all this stuff together took hundreds of hours of my life in the distant 2008. And, you know, I was satisied with this :)
I spent all my free time in this game for several months back in the days, because it was really worth it. And so far in my memory echoes of those distant years spent in this game were heard. And now, after more than 10 years, I decided to plunge again into the world of Oblivion, into a world that I loved so much.

[b]In this review, I will try to talk about everything in order, considering the game in modern realities. So, let's begin the review: [/b]
[list]
[*][h1]Gameplay[/h1]

The first thing that meets us is the customization of your character. It's just great here. Everything according to the standard - from the choice of folk to the height and shade of your eyebrows. In general, a complete immersion in the creation of a unique game character, and even in 2019, many games this is still not possible. Personally, I spent about 30 minutes just to create a “perfect” character. But when I was younger I made some really funny characters, the game is allowed to do [b]anything[/b].

Then the player is given the opportunity to choose the ""class"" of his character. In this case, in the game it was really possible to play back several classes - a swordsman (heavy armor), a magician, an assassin/thief/archer (light armor). At the same time, you should make a choice in advance, because the initial “setup” of the character greatly affects the gameplay as a whole and an incorrectly created character can ruin [b]the whole[/b] impression of the gameplay. 
Personally, I liked playing the thief in Oblivion, and although the game itself is not about “this,” but I got a lot more pleasure than in the same “Thief”, stealing more than 15,000 items for the game... I don’t know, maybe I have problems, but it’s really interesting to steal things here, because each character lives his own life, on his own schedule and each has his own secrets and “skeletons” in the closet, and the loot is very different and interesting.

Well, when the character is created and now we are allowed to get acquainted with the game interface, the combat system and various other features of the game. Here, in principle, there is nothing to say - everything is just fine, the game pleases with a [b]huge[/b] arsenal of spells, interesting alchemy, the ability to enchant various armor and weapons, which in turn are also very many. The pumping system is quite logical and I always liked this. Do you want to learn to own something at a high level? Practice is the key to success, that's all. It is also nice to have teachers of crafts, martial arts and magic, who can greatly accelerate process of leveling . All they ask for in return is a small number of Septims. In general, I really like the character pumping system in TES. And yeah, almost forgot, you can go ANYWHERE since you've finished the ""prologue"" of the game. Absolutely freedom!
There is only one controversial moment in the gameplay for me. It's the thing that level of enemies is adjusted to the level of development of your character, it's because the game tries to maintain the interest of the player until the very end. It’s a pity, because I really want to feel like a tough guy, who can kill anyone with a couple of blows, but in the end we get that being the head of the guild of magicians, fighters, thieves, a listener of a dark brotherhood, and some goblin still can beat you... These are here are the problems of dragonborn :)

[*][h1]Storyline and Lore[/h1]
The main plot in Oblivion is dull and uninteresting, I’ll leave it aside, game is just not about that...
Specifically for lore - I take off my hat! A huge number of books, quests, remarks ... I wouldn't want to talk about this topic for a long time, there is something to say, but I will say only one word. Bravo! Lore is [b]ENORMOUS[/b] and elaborate.
Quests deserve special attention. Some of them are just awesome. No matter how I like other RPG games, quests in Oblivion are just best. They are original, vary, there's not only ""go, bring/kill"" missions, no. It's not about Oblivion.
Personally for me “A Shadow over Hackdirt"" is favorite quest It refers us to the story of H.P. Lovecraft’s “The Shadow Over Innsmouth”. When I read the story itself - I got goosebumps, and passing this quest I caught something like a “Vietnamese flashback”. It was just awesome! Or as an example, a quest with the purchase of a cheap mansion with ghosts, where you have to rid the house of the disease. Or the one where we were looking for the missing artist in the painting. And don't froget about the quests of the dark brotherhood and the guild of thieves? My advice to you - be sure to go through them, you will not regret it.

And since I was talking about quests - I didn't play in game's  addons before, but I had the pleasure to go through them this year. It's worth it. ""Shivering Isles"" is one of the most atmospheric add-ons I've ever played. Spending time in this, it really seemed to me that I'm starting to go a little crazy like the people on these islands... 
""Knights of the Nine"" are good too, but the islands simply overshadowed everything they could...

[*][h1]Graphics[/h1]
As for the graphics - I played the “clean” version, without graphic modifications, and the graphics didn't spoil the gameplay at all, and the amazing starry sky is worth it... Still as beautiful as is could be...Even in 2019, I was surprised at its beauty! And knowing what mods can do with this game - I can say with responsibility - the graphics are good. Yes, sometimes the draw-distance is frightening, the edges seem unstressed, the animations are crooked, but after such an amount of time ... Damn, this is definitely worth respect! 
[/list]

What can I say in summary? The game doesn't require a powerful PC for itself, a lot of memory on the hard drive, but the picture still can be good. It's still interesting to do some quests, make you unique character with his unique story, to decide the fate of people and do whatever you want. You'll be always able to save the empire, but not to complete every side-quest :)",1577304575,1664993312,True,32,1,0.776434540748596191,0,True,False,False

If you don't want to play this because Skyrim ""looks better"", you are a moron. Learn to apply yourself

If you are new to playing Oblivion, here's some advice for your early run, do these as soon as you're free to roam:

Head to Weye (directly to the West of the Imperial City) and do the quest where you kill Slaughterfish, you'll get a ring that gives you Waterbreathing - basically making Argonian a laughably irrelevant race pick and Potions of Sea an easy sell if you ever loot them. Waterbreathing can be surprisingly handy and you can always swap rings around

Head to Aleswell (North of the Imperial City) and do the Quest there, you get a free place to stay and safe containers, effectively making buying a house unnecessary for a majority of your run

Deliver the Amulet to Weynon priory and you can get a free horse from Prior Maborel, exploring the wilderness can give you a good range of locations to loot and fight in for the sake of levelling skills and getting loot. Jauffre gives you a load of free items too.",1664833835,1664833835,True,0,0,0.492610841989517212,0,True,False,False

Oblivion does atmosphere incredibly well, the soft lighting, the beautiful vistas and gorgeous forests populated with fantastical creatures really scratches the fantasy world itch for me. That being said it does have a myriad of problems that come with it and I imagine it can feel rather dated without the rose-tinted glasses of nostalgia, but if you can get past the somewhat jank combat, unintuitive leveling system and hearing the same 15 voices throughout the entire game, you'll find a gem. The magic in this game is incredibly open and is the last game that gives you the freedom to create your own spells as silly or broken as you'd like.

The Oblivion gates are the elephant in the room, they feel samey and bleak, when one would imagine that the physical representation of Mehrunes Dagon, whose domains include not just destruction and revolution, but change, ambition and energy would be more interesting than an orange island with a bunch of lava. Beyond that, Sean Bean is fucking incredible and hard carries the main story with his performance of Martin.

The shining gem of this game is the Dark Brotherhood storyline. It's an incredibly experience riddled with intrigue and missions where you can exceed what is asked of you by eliminating targets with unique stipulations I.E. making it seem like an accident by dropping a wall mounted head on the target, and faking the death and subsequently resuscitating of the target. I'll leave the rest of them as the experience is probably the best part of the game. 

In short, this game holds some of my best videogame memories and I don't think I'll ever have the same type of relationship with a game as I've had with Oblivion. That may be simply be due to becoming older and losing that childish sense of wonder but nevertheless, this game fucks, hard.",1514577189,1664757092,True,2,0,0.518867909908294678,0,True,False,False

Things to watch out for: 
1. When doing Wizards Guild quest for recommendation, the amulet quest, don't take the amulet without beating up the enemy boss, otherwise after you take the amulet to that granny, she won't give you the dialogue to finish the quest, although you can get around that with console, it's still better to just not skip the cut scene and just kill the damn wizard.
2. While doing fighters guild quest, Azani Blackheart, be sure to wait for Orynn to get his fat a$$ to the domain before finishing the quest, otherwise he gets stuck in the previous dungeon and even if you talk with him, you can't finish the quest and advance the fighters guild quest line.
3.When doing quest in Shivering Isles for the calm pants, only give one cake to the beggar otherwise he gives 2 and the quest gets broken, you can't finish the quest or get rid of those pants, unless you use console to drop one pair of pants or finish quest forcefully through command etc..
4. You can get stuck in a lot of places in oblivion, but that can be solved by pressing "" ` "" button on the keyboard to open the console and inputting ""tcl"" to toggle the collision off and after you get unstuck, you can just do it again to toggle collision on.

Before I owned an Xbox 360, my first experience was with it on display of the second (or was it third?) story of the Virgin Mega Store in Downtown Disney, Orlando FL. I played a little of the tutorial but when you're on vacation in Disney even during the evening, you aren't gonna spend all your time playing Oblivion in a music store. 

When I finally got the game and an Xbox 360, I made a woodelf archer. And after I had made it a good way through the main storyline, my character promptly contracted the disease that turns you into a vampire and slowly but surely as I sought a cure I just couldn't do it fast enough. That, or I think there was a witch I was supposed to meet that ended up no-showing? Probably was an early glitch. Was super sad though at that time, haha.

Later when in college my sister got the game and started having phone conversations with me about it. We'd talk about quests and NPCs and things we'd found. After she got the game was when I started playing again and finally pulled through to the end. And yes, my new character did contract the disease-- which promptly in the early stages I had wiped away from my character. Duh!

To this day I still have fond memories of the game. I still know it as the game with far more secrets and less linearity than its older brother Skyrim. And although it says I've only played it for 50 hours here, I definitely put in my 1 to 200 hour stint(s) on that Xbox 360. And just like the others, there are mods to bring the game closer to new games in style and look. The community is fun and wide reaching. But this IS about the game.

But NOT WITHOUT THAT MOD. I don't know who designed the faces of the NPCs in this game, but it's possible they only know what people look like from a rough description. 

It took a few re-installs to get this thing going with mods, but now that it's going, it's going. I'm running twenty or so mods and an ENB, and I've had two crashes in 27 hours. I'd say that's bloody amazing for a bethesda game. The gameplay is solid, the combat is more action than RPG (no more hidden dice rolls). There is a low to medium amount of actual role-playing. High amount of exploration. Quests are good at giving you enough clues to figure it out without having to hold your hand through the whole thing. 

The world design is absolutely amazing. I've heard it said that all of Cyrodiil looks samey. Believe me it doesn't. Bruma, in the north, resembles Skyrim. The woods around Leyawiin, in the south, have a distinct swampy, marshy vibe. Every major city has it's own vibe, it's own distinct architecture, it's all designed quite beautifully. The dungeons on the other hand, do tend to feel samey. Once you've seen one cave, you've seen them all. 

The character design is done very well. It's difficult to have variety when you've only got, like, six voice actors, but somehow most NPCs end up feeling quite unique. At least the one's that have a quest attached. Patrick Stewart and Sean Bean are bloody amazing in this, and it makes me wish more games would hire bigger name actors. 

The sound design is good. Atmosphere is a bit lacking in some locations. Caves and dungeons are fine, but a bit of background bustle in towns and inns and whatnot would've made things feel a bit more lively and natural. The music on the other hand, is breathtaking. This may well be my favourite The Elder Scrolls soundtrack. It's unique, while still retaining that TES vibe. There are melodies and motifs in common with previous TES games. Absolutely marvellous.

Knights of the Nine DLC:
A bunch of dungeon diving with interesting lore-diving. The armour/weapons you get from this quest is not worth it, as you must keep your infamy at no more than 1. If you go over you can't use the armour until you go to 9 *UNMARKED* shrines that are all over the map. It's just... wut. 

Shivering Isles DLC:
It's an interesting change to Cyrodil's traditional fantasy setting, but it started feeling overbearing after awhile, and it's not a short DLC. I personally found the story boring. A daedric prince (Sheogorath, prince of madness) gets you to do some stuff because another daedric prince (Jyggalag) wants to take over his realm. I just feel like it could've been a fun exploration of oblivion and daedra, but instead it's just a series of fetch quests.

Jokes aside, it's pretty much that in most aspects except for story/writing. The main story is fine, but the random sidequest stuff was more my jam. Shivering isles story was actually a lot more interesting than the main one for me.

On technical side of things, it works fine, just add the unofficial patches and you're golden. Crashed maybe a few times over ~70h, so that's fine. Got corrupted save once when it crashed while saving, but since i quicksave often it was no problem. The shivering isles dlc on the other hand was real crashfest, sometimes crashing 3 times in 15min, but sometimes fine for a few h.

Gameplay feels kinda dated now, but still acceptable, although the UI was kind of a pain, and some leveling bs was just stupid. Cmon, merchantile is ok as a skill, but why there are a bunch of items that greatly exceed the maximum value that you can sell the items for even at max level? I finished the game with 30+ daedric warhamers, cuirass and some others stuffed in a chest, because they felt stupid to sell for like half their maximum price, but i got maxed the skill and find out that you just cant sell it for more anyway... Just some stupid stuff like that.
Magic was fun, until you ran out of keybninds for it and had to scroll trough probably 100+ spells to find the one you wanted to use now... At the endgame the combat had just become tedious, so just equipped random items with melee/magic reflect and became a hedgehog who just had to heal and repair armour once in a while and enemies just died while you were just passing trough.
So, idk, the game is good, the content is aplenty, the writing is solid enough that i read like half the books i found, and if you want some changes or even more content the modding community has a bunch to offer.

What a fantastic game. If you haven't played it and are wondering if you should. Yes, yes you should. The graphics and animations are dated, but the story is fine and the world is fantastic. One of my favorite games from my childhood. I originally played on the PS3. The dialogue is hilarious at times and the delivery is fantastic. It creates some lasting memories. Just go watch some Youtube videos about it. I compare toddlers talking to each other like NPCs talking to each other in Oblivion.

Although I may view other games as being objectively better, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is the single-player game I will always go back to.

Bethesda tried to recreate little parts of reality in the interactions between customized NPCs and their scheduled AI. They failed horribly and created instead listless deformed humanoids that lack the intelligence to do little more than bump into one another and echo the same conversation they heard from their previous collision. They lack the social awareness not to steal apples in front of a crowd of guards, nonchalantly stumble over corpses in the town square, or calmly approach a man wearing the recently murdered Emperor's robes.

These NPCs do not resemble human beings at all, questionably apart from their character models. They are insane, compulsive, and often ghoulish creatures. (Searching through random NPC houses will commonly unearth status within the Mythic Dawn, Dread Father shrines, and other signs of repulsive activity.) It is inspiring in a way to see a thing so close yet so distant in reference to human society.

Bethesda realized all of this in a moment of unbearably historic revelation and started work on the game that marks their self-actualization -- Shivering Isles. The people of Sheogorath's realm are each driven mad and suffer from individualistic fixations. Creating a society of manic and demented people is precisely what Bethesda was meant to do with their perfect skillset of idiosyncratic writing, AI that requires specific targets and times, awkward animations, and ugly character models. Instead of accidentally creating a weird RPG, they intentionally directed their labor to the highest-valued function. 

As a whole, there is an impossible amount of content to experience. For nearly 10 years of consistent play, every new game has revealed new quests (some that don't appear in the journal) that I somehow missed. The quests are consistently hilarious. Exploring is vastly rewarding, as you can discover schedules, backgrounds, and dark secrets of NPCs. There are a fair amount of treasure and unique items hidden about the world, as well. (This contrasts with Skyrim's limited content that ends in repeating quests and NPCs that reveal all there is to know about themselves in 20 minutes of town dialogue.)

There are only like 10 different voice actors (so you'll run into people talking to each other with the same voice), if you don't like staring at the NPC's potato faces you'll have to install a mod to replace their ugly heads (not sure what Bethesda was thinking when they designed these faces. Even the previous Elder Scrolls installment, Morrowind, had better faces). If you don't want to waste countless minutes repairing your weapons and armor (which is necessary, because when degraded it will reduce damage and protection), you'll have to install a mod for that as well. The UI is garbage for PC, but thankfully there's a mod that replaces it with Skyrim-like UI. The combat has no impact, you just click the LMB until the enemies drop dead - but be careful, avoid leveling up too much or you'll run into spongy enemies and bandits with daedric gear. The dungeons feel boring, lifeless and uninspiring. 

The main positive point in this game is the guild quests, which are better than Skyrim. But the main quest is just as bad if not worse than in Skyrim. I uninstalled this game after the main story had me close Oblivion Gates in every major city. I had enough of closing these gates after the first one. Even if you speed run through them just to get to the sigil stone you still have to figure out the main path while avoiding the piles of enemies that stack behind you - overall it takes much longer than killing a single dragon, which also eventually become an annoyance in Skyrim (although a far lesser one). 

I purchased this game on the back of hype from nostalgic fans, and because Skyrim is one of my favorite games of all time.

I don't mind whichever so for me it doesn't matter too much, but it is undeniably a score decrease and it limits your accessibility.

Oblivion is a confused experience. I have no idea how else to put this – It’s just an extremely unique game that constantly switches between bouts of genuine charisma, intrigue and sublime writing to being a broken, horrendous mess that stretches itself out way too thin in almost every aspect. 

To get the biggest issue out of the way: Oblivion is infamous for its technical issues. Deservedly so. It requires a lot of legwork to even get running; Despite Oblivion arguably having started the modding trend, it’s a bit of a headache to actually customize and no matter how many community fixes and patches you apply – at the end of the day, the game will still crash a ton. Funnily enough, despite the main game being an absolute nightmare – the Shivering Isles expansion ran entirely crash free, which leads me to believe that (most) of the crashes I encountered are likely tied to Cyrodiil’s cell generation. 

Now: Crashes, Non-loading Architecture, Lagspikes, Quest Softlocks, Duplicating Items, Spellmaking and Enchanting glitches; All of that aside as most reviews already tackle these, there is another thing that Oblivion is rather infamous for and it’s ultimately what makes this game an utterly miserable experience to go through, regardless of its other merits:

Oblivion’s balancing is flawed twofold: Your actual leveling process is similar to Morrowind, where performing actions, such as jumping, levels up a correlated skill, such as Acrobatics; That skill is then also tied to an Attribute, such as Endurance, Agility etc. Once a certain numbers of these skills have been increased, the player gains a level up that numerically is dependent on the exact skills that have been leveled up during the course of the previous level. This is a really disgusting way of saying that without planning, the player is going to end up gimping themselves in regular gameplay as their level-ups will result in less points gained per attribute than their enemies.

This is due to Oblivion scaling up the enemy spawn-table alongside the player’s level. This will hilariously eventually lead to situations where the player may enter some random cave to be greeted by Liches as regular enemies. Bandits eventually wearing Glass and Daedric, as if it’s some sort of MMO. The big issue with this, further than it being extremely unimmersive, which is true across the game for a variety of reasons anyhow, is that it slows down the already badly paced game tremendously. 

“Pacing” is a bit of a subjective term and a lot of it is tied to Oblivion wanting to feel more grandiose than it is. For example, to join the Mages’ Guild, the player is asked to perform a fetch quest for each of the different cities across Cyrodiil; The Fighters’ Guild intersperses its story with random Mercenary quests – it makes narrative sense, sure, but the result as per gameplay are hours upon hours of essentially empty dungeon-crawling that feels remarkably unrewarding as it is, without the game adding to it through its scaling. 

This is not to say that Oblivion is difficult. In fact, it’s very easy – similarly to Morrowind, just due to the stats and how the game at its fundamental level handles player power. The difference though is, that Oblivion is much less “explosive” than Morrowind. Within ten hours of gameplay, I was immune to magic. Due to me playing a Breton and finding accessories to support my innate resistance. I could’ve chosen to be completely immune to physical damage by the later half of the main story too – the issue being more that you being tanky is also very true for enemies. The end result for me was a choice between playing on regular or high difficulties – or the easiest being reasonably no different, other than how long I would take to crawl through a dungeon. The actual, palpable difficulty is the same. 

My point being is that the DNA of Oblivion’s combat is inherently dysfunctional. Being broken is good – but Oblivion just misses the mark by having gutted some of the freedoms that Morrowind used to have that would have allowed this sort of scaling to function and continuing that trend into Skyrim through more and more streamlining. 

Likewise Oblivion’s story is being joked about a lot. The small clips of one of their one-and-a-half voice actors needing to repeat a line; Beggars switching between voices because it’s the same guy putting on a different persona, the radiant dialogue etc.; Though Oblivion genuinely is quite well written – Side quests, not guilds, but genuine on-the-street side quests are among the most well developed I’ve seen in an RPG, but it suffers from the exact previous factor of the game being so utterly unimmersive due to its very design, that whenever Oblivion hits, or ties to hit an actual note, it is immediately contrasted by the actual freak-show that is its world. 

There are countless examples to point at, but one that I absolutely adored when it happened, but in hindsight really isn’t a good show of what, I *think* the game tries to be, happens during the Fighters’ Guild. [spoiler]During the finale of the Fighters’ Guild, the PC inadvertently murders an entire village. You help capture an enemy Mercenary and aid in his torture before raiding their headquarters for the greater good. When completed, you are announced the new head of the Guild and go back to re-recruit a friend who initially rejects because he took on a painting hobby. Said painting stands in the corner of the room and is a crayon drawing of him torturing the mercenary.[/spoiler] It’s surreal. It is such violent tonal whiplash, that I genuinely burst out laughing thinking this was due to some mod. But it’s not – and it happens again and again.

Another example of this would be the Adoring Fan – an elf sidekick that is functionally immortal. Just closed that apocalyptic demon gate? By Azura, by Azura, by Azura – It’s the grand champion. The game is very aware of this too, but seemingly just rides the wave and tries to hit the serious notes regardless. 

And funnily enough for one part of the game, it somehow works. The Shivering Isles are phenomenal. They’re a unique setting with a reasonably tight design all throughout – and, whether by dumb chance or luck, or whatever else – I didn’t experience a single crash or buggy quest there either. 


[u]TL;DR[/u]
+ Fantastic Sidequests
+ Fairly unique setting, although the game struggles to make use of it throughout many of its quests. 
+ Shivering Isles actually functions lol

+/- Ridiculous tonal whiplash throughout the story; The game oozes charm at the cost of immersion. 
+/- Pacing; While you may not become an Archmage during an afternoon like in Skyrim, almost anything is stretched out over what often feels like filler fetch-quests and overly extensive dungeon-crawls.

- Hopelessly broken. Crashes and bugs are absolute commonplace regardless of the fixes you may apply.
- Balance; both for player and enemies is nonexistent and made infinitely worse by scaling spawn-tables.

In a weird sense, I enjoyed replaying Oblivion. It was my first Bethesda game and I have a fair bit of nostalgia for it. Having now gone back through and played it all again from Morrowind to Daggerfall to Skyrim to even peripheral titles like Enderal and now back to Oblivion, I never ever want to even play another second of it. And this is not because the game itself – the concept and world of Oblivion - is “bad” – it is good, but the flaws it does have are so fundamental and so rotten that the minute-to-minute experience just is kind of miserable. It may be worth recommending it for the unique experience it offers, or even just for the Shivering Isles, but that is a lot of weight to put on that expansion’s shoulders; And the legwork that is required to even get the game to run in any capacity at all, too, is an enormous ask which ultimately just isn’t really worth it.",1663479040,1663482067,False,9,1,0.618998229503631592,0,True,False,False

[h1]1)You can use mods, but you don’t have to:[/h1]
When I was planning my most recent play of Oblivion, I though it would be necessary the use of mods. I’ve delayed starting this game for a while because of this - since Oblivion is not easy to mod as Skyrim is. Truth is that I’ve started totally vanilla and stayed that way through the end of a 100h campaign and I can say that this game holds up pretty well without any mods.

The game is still beautiful, the art is incredible, the whole visual is still appealing somehow. Mechanics works pretty well and etc. I know mods can improve a lot of things but I think modding Oblivion is not a requirement to enjoy the game today.

[h1]2)You should play on first person perspective:[/h1]
That goes for every Bethesda games mostly. Third person is janky and not cool. It works for when you want to see your character and that’s it. If you want to play a third person game I suggest going for another game. Oblivion is a first person game and this is a game change thing for me.

[h1]3)Keyboard and Mouse are game changes:[/h1]
I was always a controller guy and I had a lot of fun playing Oblivion on my old PS3 back in 2010, but that was there. Playing with KM is so much better that I can’t even tell and this is something that can totally change how you feel the game. And it’s not only about using hotkeys and having a more free control of the camera movement. It’s about just everything! Even the bad menu navigation that were based on consoles works better with KM in my opinion.

[h1]4)Some builds works better than others gameplaywise:[/h1]
The best mechanics for me is sword and shield, magic and not so much playing stealthy. That tip works for Skyrim as well. Playing a stealth build works nicely in some way, however, the mechanics are a bit dated for a stealth game - and also makes exploring dungeons way too long and a bit boring in my opinion, specially compared to newer entries on stealth mechanics over the past 15 years. So, my tip for making the best of the gameplay is playing with magic plus/or weapons and shield and going wide open exposing yourself in combat.

You can actually do what you want and playing stealthy can be a lot of fun as well. It works in the end! Just consider what I am saying specially if you feel that the game is dragging. Also, because I didn’t try all the possible builds as well so I’m just saying what I feel rather than try to set some rules here. 

[h1]5)The combat feels like “Doom or Quake” and it’s awesome:[/h1]
The combat is way more fast paced than Skyrim - and that actually depends on your build as well. Playing with a no armor mage I felt I was like the doom guy shooting magic instead of a gun, and it was awesome. On another play I tried sword and shield with heavy armor and it was way slower, but even so, more arcadish than what I feel when I play Skyrim - which is slower and heavier. 

That said, for me the most important thing to note is the timing of the enemies attacks. It is way more easier to dodge compared to Skyrim. Which makes running around and dodging multiple incoming attacks more manageable in Oblivion. And sometimes I felt like playing Quake, or Doom, for real. This makes the Oblivion combat fun and kind of unique, more closer to boomers shooters I think!


[h1]6)Pure mage is pure fun:[/h1]
Playing as pure mage is unique in Oblivion due to the quantity of spells you have at your disposal. You can do just about everything with magic: you can walk over water, breath under water, become invisible, control other players and creatures, open chests, bring objects to your hand using telekinesis, create space on your inventory by increasing how much weight you can carry, detect others around using life detection, summon creatures to help you in battle, etc. Mix all that with alchemy options and I had the best experience as a mage ever in an RPG game. The fact that you have a dedicated and separated button to magic instead of equipping as a weapon helps as well since you can use enchanted weapons with magic in a more practical way. Skyrim has the dual cast benefit, which is absent here, but I think I prefer Oblivion way. 

Oblivion has a spell efficiency mechanic that benefits no armor use. My mage wears common clothes, lol. What I did to deal with the no protection problem was using shield spells and later enchanting my clothes with  stacking shield spells as well. You can be a truly overpowered beast playing as pure mage in Oblivion and it’s so much fun since you’ll use magic for everything, all the time.

[h1]7)Sword and shield play:[/h1]
Later I did a play with a second character using a traditional sword and shield approach, but trying a custom class that included alchemy and restoration spells. The heavy armor makes the combat slower and you need to study the timing on investing attacks and raising the shields way more. It takes more attention and makes the game way harder. I think the sword fighting of Oblivion and Skyrim are still very good for a first person melee combat. It holds up pretty well and it is a different game than playing with a pure mage. 

[h1]8)The dialogs are better than I was expecting:[/h1]
There is tons of Oblivion memes on the internet regarding the fun dialog and AI. Bethesda tried what they’ve called ‘radiant AI’ for the time and it was a bit of marketing and a bit of a flaw because of not reaching the level of promising and ambitious it was intended. However, Oblivion is not a dumb game. It’s the opposite actually, since quests and story lines tend to have better explanations than what they did in Skyrim, for example. In Skyrim characters tend to be more direct to the point and this is a bit rough sometimes in my opinion. Oblivion has pretty decent lines and explanations and can be really engaging even on some small quests. That was something I wasn’t expecting so it was a nice surprise.    

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]
Oblivion is still a pretty decent game that can be surprisingly good even on vanilla. Gameplay is up to date, visuals can be surprisingly beautiful sometimes, the text is decent, and exploration is rewarding. Highly recommended for anyone, because I’ve never felt as I was playing an old game, for real.

Positive: The province of Cyrodiil is really big, with dozens and dozens of locations to explore! The stories are imaginative and expansive, and the quests are some of the best and most creative ones I've ever played! (but not ALL of them). Speaking of quests, there are so many cool side quests, that they can be a really fun distraction from the main story for a while! The setting feels authentic, and this game has a knack for immersing you in the world! 

Negative: This game's graphics haven't aged well. Some of the shaders are pretty, but... the NPCs are a little bit nightmarish... This game also has a lot of bugs, so you have to be patient with it. The combat is fun, but can be a bit lackluster and boring after a while.

Additional Stuff: The main story of this game is really good, and the Oblivion Gate stuff is fun too! (Although, they can sometimes be annoying). The epic conclusion (which I won't spoil) made my jaw drop when I first saw it. (Granted, I was 12). I can't stress enough how cool some of the quests are. Here's an example: 

A local painter has gone missing. You go to his house and ask his wife if you can see his workshop. When you enter his studio, you see an unfinished painting, and an open window. When you approach the painting, you get sucked into it! Once inside, you find the painter. He explains that his grandfather was a terrible painter, who got a magic paintbrush from one of the gods after she took pity on him. With the paintbrush, you can enter the painting and paint the environment perfectly, and that's why the look so life-like. When his grandfather died, it was passed down to him. One day, an thief sneaked into his studio, hopped into the painting, and stole the brush. He also painted a bunch of trolls so he couldn't be followed. But the thief was killed by the trolls on the other side of the painting. You have to kill the trolls and get the brush, so you and the painter can get out.

Whenever I try and think of my favorite quest in Oblivion, this is what always comes to mind. It's just such a creative idea!
Anyways, sorry for the long review, I just want to be thorough. I will always love this game, and recommend this game 100%. 8.75/10",1555375079,1662895024,True,16,1,0.664915084838867188,0,True,False,False

Well, with the help of a few mods, I have finally dove into a proper playthrough of Oblivion, and I have to say that I am very. very glad that I finally took the leap and put in some effort with this game. The world is very charming, and I am beginning to seriously consider the idea that it might actually be the better game compared to Skyrim. The faction system has been more intriguing, the story has me gripped much more than Skyrim's main quest, and the character progression is very deep and rewarding. I am still in what feels like the early stages of the playthrough 40+ hours in, and I am feeling like I just might have to see the main quest through to completion (something I never did with Skyrim somehow after all this time).
